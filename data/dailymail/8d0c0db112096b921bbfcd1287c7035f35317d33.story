China has showed its growing impatience with Malaysia over the hunt for missing jet MH370 and warned it must 'immediately' expand the search.

As the list of countries involved in the hunt rose to 26, China's Foreign Ministry said Malaysia needs to clarify the scope of the operation which now covers an area the size of Africa.

Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular briefing in Beijing that China's ambassador to Malaysia met Malaysia's foreign minister on Monday.

Missing: China has warned Malasia must step up the search for the Boeing 777-200ER Malaysia that disappeared on March 9

No trace of the plane has been found 
more than a week after it vanished but investigators believe it was 
diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and commercial 
navigation.

Satellite data suggests the plane could be anywhere in either of two vast arcs: one stretching from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan, or a southern arc from Indonesia into the Indian Ocean west of Australia.

'Of course search and rescue efforts have become even harder now, and the area is much bigger,' Hong said. 'We hope that Malaysia can provide more thorough, accurate information to countries participating.'

Hong declined to comment when asked if China is checking into the backgrounds of the Chinese passengers on board in search of suspicious histories.

He declined to say whether China is searching over Tibet and the western region of Xinjiang for the jet, or whether China has ruled out that the plane entered its airspace.

About two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight were Chinese.

Malaysian investigators are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, crew and ground staff who worked on the missing Boeing 777-200ER for clues as to why someone on board flew it perhaps thousands of miles off course.

Today, Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein reiterated his country is doing all it can and finding the jet is its 'first priority'.

He also repeated Malaysia's rejection of suggestions it is holding information back.

'The fact that 
there was no distress signal, no ransom notes, no parties claiming 
responsibility, there is always hope,' Hishammuddin said.

The Ministry of Transport in Kuala Lumpur today issued a revised
list of the countries that are helping physically with aircraft and ships or by
examining data that might help pinpoint the fate of MH370.

The revised list, increased yesterday from 14
to 25, has now grown to 26.

The countries are Malaysia, Australia,
Bangladesh, Brunei, China, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Myanmar, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Russia,
Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Turkmenistan, UAE, UK US, Uzbekistan and
Vietnam.

Assistance requested from all these countries,
where applicable, is radar and satellite information, land, sea and aerial
search operations and search and rescue action plans of those countries.

MALAYSIA

Malaysia, which is co-ordinating the search, has deployed about 18 aircraft and 27 ships, including the submarine support vessel MV Mega Bakti, which can detect objects at a depth of up to 3,280ft (1,000m).

AUSTRALIA

Australia has sent two AP-3C Orion aircraft, one of which is searching the waters to the north and west of the Cocos Islands. Australia's defence department is refusing to say whether Malaysia has asked Australia to divulge any radar information, but Prime Minister Tony Abbott said all Australian agencies 'are scouring their data to see if there's anything they can add to the understanding of this mystery'.

CHINA

An official with the Chinese Civil Aviation Authority says the missing plane did not enter Chinese airspace. The Chinese Defence Ministry and Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to questions on radar information. China has deployed nine navy ships and civilian patrol vessels and a variety of fixed wing and rotary aircraft, along with a team of experts dispatched to Malaysia.

UNITED STATES

A P-8A Poseidon, the most advanced long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft in the world, has been searching in the Indian Ocean. The US Navy has also deployed the destroyer USS Kidd with two MH-60R helicopters.

INDONESIA

Indonesian air force spokesman Hadi Tjahjanto says military radars on Sumatra island found no trace of the jetliner and that data requested by the Malaysian government had been handed over. He says that search efforts have shifted from the Malacca Strait to the corridor stretching from northern Sumatra to the Indian Ocean.

PAKISTAN

The director-general of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, Muhammed Yousaf, says radar recordings shared with Malaysia found no sign of the jetliner.

INDIA

India put its search operations in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal on hold this weekend and continues to co-ordinate with Malaysia about possible new search areas.

THAILAND

Royal Thai Air Force spokesman Montol Suchookorn says the Thai military gave its radar data to Malaysia on March 10 and has not received any additional requests. The Royal Thai Navy suspended its search mission in the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea on Saturday.

OTHERS

Other nations involved are Bangladesh, Brunei, Burma, France, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, the UK, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.
