Charged: Ian John McLoughlin, 55, has been charged with the murder of 66-year-old grandfather Graham Buck

Police this afternoon charged Ian John McLoughlin with the murder of 66-year-old grandfather Graham Buck.

Mr Buck received fatal stab wounds after rushing to the aid of an 87-year-old neighbour who was being robbed in his home in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire.

McLoughlin, 55, was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday morning at an address in Tottenham, North London.

He was charged this afternoon with murder, robbery and possessing cannabis and will appear at Hatfield Remand Court tomorrow.

Two other people have been charged with assisting an offender in relation to the case and will also appear in court.

Officers tracked down McLoughlin, 55, and arrested him at around 
1am on Wednesday morning after he was spotted by a member of the public.

He allegedly went to the home of convicted paedophile 
Francis Cory-Wright, 87, in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, on Saturday.

Neighbour 
Graham Buck heard cries for help and dashed to his aid.

Mr Buck was fatally stabbed after confronting the assailant.

Detective Chief Superintendent Jeff Hill said Mr Buck, described as a retired financial industry worker, paid the 'ultimate price' for intervening during the robbery at the home of an elderly neighbour.

Mr Buck leaves behind a wife, two sons and a daughter, two grandchildren and a former wife.In
 a statement police described him as a devoted husband, father and 
grandfather who 'appreciated his life, getting great satisfaction from 
his family being happy and healthy'.

'He was a man who would help anyone in need, with a strong sense of doing the right thing,' it said.

An earlier statement from Mr Buck's family said: 'We have no words to express how much Graham will be missed. We were all in such a happy place as a family. We were all so settled, with growing numbers of grandchildren whom he adored being around.

'We haven't seen him happier than being around his grandchildren, he was so proud. We cannot get over that we have lost him.

'He's going to be missed by so many people.'
