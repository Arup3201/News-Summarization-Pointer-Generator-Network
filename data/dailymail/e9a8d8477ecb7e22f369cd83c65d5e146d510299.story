Moya Greene, chief executive of the Royal Mail, said: 'The Diamond Jubilee, only the second in royal history, is a very important anniversary. The whole world’s attention will be drawn towards this special occasion.

'Royal Mail is honoured to have such an enduring relationship with the Queen. We are proud to mark the occasion by celebrating the official roles of the Queen with distinctive and memorable images, many of which have not been widely seen before.

'The stamps chart the Queen’s reign across the six decades and highlight her unwavering commitment to national duty.'

The stamps, on sale from May 31 at all Post Office Branches,.are the third and final stamp issue to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.
