Jailed: Jennifer Davies was sentenced to 15 months in jail at Exeter Crown Court after pleasing guilty to stealing more than £20,000 from the Santander branch where she worked in Torquay

A bank cashier stole from more than £20,000 from customers to pay off her brother's gambling debts, purchase a car and fund a lavish holiday.

Jennifer Davies, 25, took the money from  customer deposits at the Santander branch in Torquay where she worked as cashier.

But investigators became suspicious when they noticed amounts similar to those going missing were turning up in Davies' own bank account with the bank.

Davies was sentenced to 15-months in jail at Exeter Crown Court today after pleading guilty to 13 incidents of theft.

The court heard how Davies, who was described as 'on the 
lowest tier of staff', had responsibility for reconciling money lodged in the branch's ATM deposit box.

She began to siphon off money contained in some of the customers’ deposit envelopes, with the sum eventually totalling  £20,150.

Her spending included £4,000 towards her brother's gambling debts; £7,495 on a Mini; £549 on a bed and £2114 on a holiday, of which she had paid out £882.

A search of her property also revealed nearly £1,000 in notes and bags of coins.

Sentencing a tearful Davies to jail 
today, recorder David Bartlett said: 'This was a case of simply using 
the money for your own benefit. It is not as if you had seriously sick 
relatives.

'You made use of the money which you found easy to steal for your own purposes.

Unsophisticated: Davies' theft, totalling £20,150 over 18 months at a Santander branch in Torquay, was described as 'fairly unsophisticated'

'I
am afraid my view is that people in your position who abuse the trust 
of their employers for a period in excess of a year and run up a loss to
them of more than £20,000 simply have to go to prison and go to prison 
immediately.'

James Taghdissian, prosecuting, said Davies had been employed with the bank for five years, more recently working as a cashier at the Fleet Street branch in Torquay.

He said Davies 'just pocketed' some of the customers' lodgements she was meant to reconcile with the company's accounts.

Mr Taghdissian said: 'She (told police) she paid money into her account from renting out her property. People were repaying loans. It didn’t make very much sense.'

Theft: Recorder David Bartlett told Exeter Crown Court (pictured) that the theft 'was a case of simply using the money for your own benefit'. He added: 'It is not as if you had seriously sick relatives'

But she later confessed to police during, saying she initially started to steal cash to help pay off her brother’s £4,000 gambling debt, the court was told.

Defending, David Charles said his client, who pleaded guilty at the earliest possible stage, had admitted she had 'ruined her life'.

'You could suggest she has been extremely naive,' he said, adding that Davies had been diagnosed with depression last year.

The recorder told Davies he had been 'most merciful' in passing the sentence, but added: 'I’m sorry to have to do this, but you must realise you must be punished for a sustained abuse of trust.'
