She is certainly well on her way to becoming the world’s richest woman.

Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, recently took home a fat bundle of cash after receiving $401 million in company stock and selling 2% of her shares for $7.4 million.

Her big reward was part of a $3.1 billion dollar payday at the company last week after restrictions on insider trading expired.

Making friends: Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg talks to the press at a Seoul, Korea hotel on September 14, 2012.

Passing by: Sandberg passes Google co-founder Sergey Brin, left, at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 12, 2012.

43-year-old Sandberg spent her childhood in North Miami Beach, Florida, and received her M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 1995. Her first job after leaving business school was working as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company.

In 2004 she married David Goldberg, chief executive of the web survey development company SurveyMonkey, after divorcing Brian Kraff, co-founder and chief executive of the web marketing company Market Hardware. Sandberg and Goldberg reside in Atherton, California, and have two children.

In June 2012 Sandberg was elected to Facebook's board of directors, becoming the first woman to serve in that role. That same year she was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine.

Celebration: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg applaud with Nasdaq CEO Robert Greifeld after Facebook goes public on May 18, 2012.

Sandberg was the highest paid employee at Facebook in 2011 with salary and stock awards earning her $30.87 million that year.

Sandberg sold 339,512 of her Facebook shares at about $21.10 each on Halloween, according to Bloomberg News. She still owns 18 million shares of company stock.

The big question suddenly buzzing throughout the tech community is whether Sandberg and other Facebook employees will stay at the company for much longer.

Facebook workers can now pursue life-long dreams they put on hold to work there, TechCrunch notes.

Facebook’s stock has hovered around $21 a share since August, down more than 50 per cent from a high of $45 when the company went public in May.

Home base: Facebook's corporate headquarters in Menlo Park, California.

Inside look: Facebook employees at work inside the company's headquarters.

Sandberg joined Facebook in 2008 and helped build it into the world’s largest social networking site worth more than $50 billion. Some estimates put her total net worth close to $2 billion.

Prior to joining Facebook Sandberg worked at Google as vice president of operations and online sales. From 1996 to 2001 she served as chief of staff for the U.S. Treasury Department.

Facebook’s first employees, including 28-year-old founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, have been at the company for almost nine years now.

Zuckerberg has promised to not sell any of his Facebook shares before September 2013.
