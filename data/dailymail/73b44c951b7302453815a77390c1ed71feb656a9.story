Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has lodged an official complaint to UEFA after claiming a bottle was hurled at him during Arsenal's 0-0 draw with Beskitas on Tuesday.

The Gunners played out a stalemate at the Ataturk Stadium, despite losing Aaron Ramsey to a sending-off after he picked up two bookings.

And Wenger insists that someone from the home crowd threw a missile in his direction as he left the pitch following the Champions League qualifier first-leg.

An investigation is now expected to be launched by European football's governing body.
