The SFA on Wednesday took the unprecedented step of announcing they are to appeal the decision to hit Rangers goalkeeper Steve Simonsen with only a one-match ban for betting on matches.

Hampden compliance officer Tony McGlennan made the surprise move after deciding the suspension — which included a one-match suspended ban — was ‘unduly lenient’.

And, as the appeal was announced, former Hampden compliance officer Vincent Lunny called the punishment ‘light’, insisting tough sanctions against footballers who gamble were necessary to help stave off the rising threat of match-fixing.

However, Simonsen’s legal team believe the original sentence was fair, given the keeper gambled just £202 over a 12-month period on a total of 55 matches.

Rangers goalkeeper Steve SImonsen was handed a one match ban for breaching betting rules

The Englishman’s modest bets were mainly placed on games played in England and Europe. He bet only once on a Scottish match — a Premiership fixture — and never on games involving his own team.

The 35-year-old former Everton, Stoke and Sheffield United keeper argued in front of the SFA- convened independent judicial panel earlier this month that he believed Scottish football followed the same rules as the FA down south when he moved north of the border in 2013.

In England, players were forbidden from betting on matches involving their own teams and on competitions in which they feature.

The FA have since updated their rulebook to follow the Scottish FA’s own zero- tolerance approach, which outlaws betting on any professional football game in the world.

The SFA believe the ban handed out by an independent judicial panel is too lenient and will appeal against it

The one-match ban handed down on February 12 saw Simonsen sit out of a 2-0 home defeat against Championship rivals Hibs at Ibrox 24 hours later.

This is the first time since the right of appeal on judicial panel judgments was introduced at the start of this season that the SFA have exercised their option to challenge a verdict. The appeal date has yet to be set.

Last night an SFA statement read: ‘The SFA can confirm that the compliance officer has appealed against the sanction imposed on Steve Simonsen.

‘An appellate tribunal will convene in due course to consider the appeal on the basis that the sanction imposed was unduly lenient.’

Ironically for Rangers, a key driving force behind the SFA pushing to introduce the power of appeal in judicial panel cases was the sentence handed out to Ibrox midfielder Ian Black.

In September 2013, Black was banned for 10 games — with seven of those suspended until the end of that season — and fined £7,500 after admitting betting on 160 matches over a seven-year period, including, crucially, laying three wagers against his own club winning.

In another case last year, Michael Moffat of Ayr United, was last year given a four-game ban — with two suspended — after placing 150 bets, including seven bets on six matches involving his own team.

Last night Lunny told BBC Sportsound: ‘Taking a tough stance now is the way to stop that (match-fixing) coming into the game.

‘For Simonsen to miss one match is perhaps light when you consider what else gets you a one-match ban, for example two yellow cards.’
