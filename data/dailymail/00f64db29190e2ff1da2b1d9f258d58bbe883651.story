The child was heard shouting insults at Christiane Taubira during a demonstration in Angers

The French government is calling for a schoolgirl to be prosecuted after she waved a banana at France's black Justice Minister. 

The child was heard shouting insults at Christiane Taubira during a demonstration in Angers, western France against the government's decision to support same-sex marriages. 

The 12-year-old was then seen waving a banana at the minister and shouting: 'Who's the banana for? It's for the monkey', according to witness Jean-Yves Lignel, a reporter with LeCourrier de l'Ouest. 

Leaders of the ruling Socialist Party now want to press charges against the girl of incitement to racial hatred.

Journalist Mr Lignel wrote on his blog: 'Nine of the adults around her did anything to stop her. Some even sniggered.' 

According to The Times, Harlem Desir, the First Secretary of the Socialist Party, said in a statement: 'It is very serious that children are being used and encouraged to shout chants of hated during protests against same sex-marriages.

'This behaviour is intolerable and constitutes a criminal offence which must now be the subject of a prosecution.'

Mr Desir believes the child's parents should be prosecuted. 

Lawyers have said that because of her age, the child cannot be jailed, fined or given a restraining order.

The 12-year-old was then seen waving a banana at the minister and shouting: 'Who's the banana for?

Ms Taubia said she didn't want to turn the situation into a soap drama but that it was worrying for society. 

An investigation has begun after a National Front candidate compared Ms Taubira to a monkey last week. 

Anne-Sophie Leclere, who is standing to become a councillor in Rethel, said: 'If push comes to shove I'd rather see her up a tree than in a government like this.'
