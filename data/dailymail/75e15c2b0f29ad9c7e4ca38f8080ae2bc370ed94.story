Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner has been accused of spending close to £20,000 a day to have the presidential plane bring her the daily newspapers while she was on holiday.

An Argentinian television claims she had the papers flown to the town of Rio Gallegos, in the south Argentinian province of Santa Cruz. 

Footage aired on the programme shows a paper boy leaving the plane in Santa Cruz airport with the newspapers that were then delivered to the president at her house.

The presenter said: 'We want someone to explain why the president spends so much to get the daily paper about a house when she could read it online the same day or have it delivered in the normal way a day later.'

He added that it would only be acceptable if the president were to pay for it with her own money, but he doubted she was prepared to spend thousands a day just to have the newspapers delivered.

Opposition UCR party politician Anselmo Martinez said: 'I can't say that this is a particular surprise because our country has a history of people using state assets for their own purposes since the time of Nestor Kirchner.

It is a well-known fact that the official aircraft fleet is at the disposal not just a president but of her relatives as well. 

The allegations came as it was revealed that Argentina could be just hours away from defaulting on its debts for the third time in three decades.

The Latin American country has until today to reach a deal with investors who have lent it money - or once again default.

Buenos Aires owes interest payments of £318 million to bondholders who agreed to take a 70 per cent haircut on their holdings following the financial crisis that rocked the country in the early 2000s.

Kirchner fears that granting the 'vulture fund' holdout investors complete repayment could trigger similar claims from other bondholders.

Last week, Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, warned that the economic cost to Argentina of defaulting again might be 'substantial'.

'I think that for Argentina, if it goes into default and doesn't pay the holdouts, there might be substantial costs in being basically unable to access markets for some time,' he said.

But IMF managing director Christine Lagarde last night tried to play down fears that a default would send shockwaves through emerging markets worldwide.

'While default is always regrettable, we do not believe that it would have major substantive consequences outside, on a much broader basis,' she said.

Santa Cruz is the home region of her late husband Nestor Kirchner who was her predecessor in the post.
