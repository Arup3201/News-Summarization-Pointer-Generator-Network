Legal action: PC Kelly Jones has dropped the case brought against a man who dialled 999

A police tsar has warned that Ministers must clamp down on a compensation culture fuelled by  no-win, no-fee lawyers, after a woman officer who tried to sue a crime victim finally dropped her claim.

PC Kelly Jones launched a compensation bid against the owner of a garage where she tripped while investigating a suspected burglary, in a case that caused outrage when revealed by The Mail on Sunday.

Last week PC Jones withdrew her legal bid although her ‘union’, the Police Federation, maintained she only ever wanted to recover income lost through her injury.

In the wake of her climbdown, the elected Police and Crime Commissioner in her force area said the case marked a new low in the compensation culture that has ‘infected’ the police and other public services.

Stephen Bett, the independent PCC for Norfolk, said: ‘This mindless no-win, no-fee compensation culture is being driven by greedy lawyers. It’s rife. Everybody seems to believe they can make a fast buck.

‘This case of a PC who suffered an injury answering a 999 call was driven by lawyers.

'It was ridiculous and it should give Westminster the ammunition it needs to legislate against them.

‘They should be told that if they fail, as they did in this case, they’ll be given a hefty bill for costs. It would act as a deterrent.’

Mr Bett fears the case has tarnished the reputation of the police.

He said: ‘The actions of this PC degrade what huge numbers of police officers do every day – running the risk of being stabbed or hit by a car.

‘The officer involved faced a huge amount of opprobrium for her actions, but she has raised questions over the genuine and vital compensation awards made to officers who have been badly hurt in the line of duty.’

PC Jones, 34, a mother of two from Thetford, Norfolk, was called to a service station in the town in August 2012 and hurt her leg and arm in a minor fall.

In March this year she launched her action against garage owner Steve Jones seeking tens of thousands of pounds in compensation.

After she dropped her claim, Mr Jones said he was delighted, describing it as a ‘victory for common sense’.

The woman with a conviction for theft who sued the police for refusing to make her a constable has been sacked from her civilian police job after a row involving her own colleagues.

Rachida Sobhi, 43, became embroiled in an argument with litter wardens after she was issued with an £80 on-the-spot penalty for dropping a cigarette butt near her home.

The uniformed enforcement officers from Kingdom Security, employed by Bromley Council in South London, called the police.

Miss Sobhi, a Metropolitan Police Community Support Officer, paid the fine after the dispute in December but her bosses at Scotland Yard hauled her before a disciplinary hearing.

The panel concluded she had behaved badly towards the law enforcement officers and sacked her.

Miss Sobhi had been part of the safer neighbourhoods team in the Kelsey and Eden Park areas in Bromley.

She was employed despite her decades-old criminal record for theft, but took legal action when chiefs would not give her a job as a PC.

Despite the latest development, Miss Sobhi is still pursuing her landmark claim against the Met and it will go before a fresh employment tribunal preliminary hearing on October 18.

Miss Sobhi could not be contacted.
