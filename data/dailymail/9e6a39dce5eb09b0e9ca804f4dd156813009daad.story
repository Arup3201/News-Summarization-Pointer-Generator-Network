The ex-England batsman top-scored in the Stars' 148 for seven against the Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash opener, but it was in a losing effort as the Strikers romped to an eight-wicket victory inside 13 overs thanks to Tim Ludeman smashing 92 from 44 deliveries.

While fielding on the boundary on Thursday, Pietersen said on player mic: 'Someone told me the England selectors were meeting this morning - I hope they've got a screen on.'

66 - Pietersen's score of 66 on debut for Melbourne Stars was his first half-century since May.

16 - It was the first time he had passed 50 in 16 innings.

27 - In 27 innings since the end of the last Ashes series, Pietersen has managed just two half-centuries. 

39 - Pietersen's top score for Surrey was 39 in 12 matches during last season's Twenty20 Blast. 

Commentator Adam Gilchrist responded: 'We know that this series is watched heavily in the UK, so there's every chance.'

The match was broadcast in Australia by the Ten Network, and they ran a poll among viewers asking whether Pietersen, 34, should play in next year's World Cup for England.

A resounding 72 per cent of viewers responded with the answer 'yes'.

Pietersen's innings was the perfect response to being dropped by Delhi Daredevils for next season's Indian Premier League following a poor campaign. 

His 66 came from just 46 balls as he struck four sixes - including one off only his second ball of the day - and two fours to finish with a strike-rate of 143.48.

The last time Pietersen scored a half-century was his 56 during the IPL for Delhi Daredevils in May - a full 16 innings ago.

In total, he has hit just two scores of 50 or more in 27 innings for the Daredevils and Surrey since the end of last winter's Ashes series. 

The controversial batsman scored a best of just 39 in 12 matches for Surrey in last year's Twenty20 Blast but he found his form again.

Bowler Kieron Pollard even had to abort his run-up after Pietersen attempted a switch-hit and then hit two successive maximums. 

Following Pietersen's return to form with his 66, pundits, ex-players and celebrities were tweeting in reaction to the innings.

He eventually fell two balls from the end of the Stars' innings, when Strikers' Johan Botha caught the South African-born Englishman off the bowling of Kane Richardson.

In response, Ludeman scored the quickest-ever half-century in BBL history after he smashed 52 off his first 18 balls before finishing unbeaten on 92.

Ludeman's opening stand of 83 with Craig Simmons set the Strikers on their way to chasing down 149 inside 13 overs.  

England's Luke Wright, meanwhile, also impressed as an opener for the Stars, scoring 45 from 37 balls - including seven fours - at the Adelaide Oval.
