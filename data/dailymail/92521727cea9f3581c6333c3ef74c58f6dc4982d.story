Actor Samuel L. Jackson, who worked as a camera stand-in for Bill Cosby for three years in the 1980s, is the latest celebrity to weigh-in on the sexual assault scandal that continues to engulf the comedian.

The Pulp Fiction star said on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live on Thursday: 'I wish he would say something.'

'Popular opinion would say, ''Where there’s smoke, there’s fire'',' Jackson said, according to philly.com.

'But, I mean, I can’t make a judgment about it. 

'I mean, I make my judgments because I have a daughter, I have a wife that I love. 

'I have a lot of women in my life, and I know, you know, women are vulnerable to society.

'And people with power take advantage of people.'

Under fire: Cosby, 77, has now been accused of sexually assaulting over 30 women 

The number of women who have accused Cosby, 77, of sexually assaulting them is now over 30.

Cosby has never directly addressed the allegations.

His lawyers and spokespeople have denied all accusations.

Many of them are decades old and fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal or civil cases. 

The abuse charges against Cosby have been bubbling since 2002, however hit fever pitch in November last year when Barbara Bowman, one of Cosby's first accusers, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post, titled 'Bill Cosby raped me. Why did it take 30 years for people to believe my story?'

Earlier this week, Cosby thanked fellow comedian Eddie Murphy for not mocking him on Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary show.

Murphy, who was making his return to SNL for the first time in 30 years, had been asked by writers to play Cosby, but decided against it because 'he didn't want to kick a man when he's down'.

'I am very appreciative of Eddie and I applaud his actions,' Cosby said through his spokesman Thursday.

A week earlier, two more women accused Cosby
 of drugging them decades ago when they met him as
young models, and one said he sexually assaulted her.  

Linda Brown and Lise-Lotte Lublin came forward as the latest women to bring public accusations against Cosby at
the Los Angeles office of attorney Gloria Allred, who
acknowledged it was too late for them to sue Cosby.

Brown told reporters she met Cosby in 1969 in Canada and
went to his hotel suite where he gave her a soft drink that
caused her to black out. She said that when she woke up, she was
naked next to him in bed.

'I couldn't move or speak. I felt paralyzed, he flipped me
over and sexually assaulted me,' Brown said. 'I felt like a rag
doll and like a real-life blow-up doll for him.'

Lublin said she met Cosby in 1989 at a hotel in Las Vegas
and that he asked her to perform an improvisation on the pretext
of evaluating her acting. The comedian gave her two alcoholic
drinks that caused her to feel disoriented, she said.

Lublin said that a short time later, he embraced her. She
said her memory of the incident was hazy and that she remembered
waking up at her home in the area and not knowing how she got
there.

Allred said Brown and Lublin believed Cosby drugged them,
which other women in media interviews have also said happened to
them in encounters with the comedian.

In an emotional press conference held on February 12, Linda Brown recounted how in 1969, when she was 21 years old, her modelling agency set her up with Cosby on a dinner date while he was performing in Toronto, reported the New York Daily News.

The one-time cover girl is best known for being the first model to appear on TV dressed only in a bra in a 1969 Wonderbra commercial.

Brown recalled that Cosby showed her pictures of his family over dinner, and then offered to give her a ride home in his limousine.

On the way home, the comic allegedly told her he needed to stop by his hotel to pick up a present for someone, and he invited her up to his suite.

According to Brown, Cosby handed her a beverage and left the room to make a phone call.

'I took a sip and blacked out,' the woman recalled, adding that when she awakened, she inexplicably found herself lying naked under the covers beside Cosby.

She said she left the room feeling 'dirty, ashamed and embarrassed.'

Lisa-Lotte Lublin described a similar experience involving Bill Cosby, which allegedly occurred in Las Vegas in 1989, when she was 23 years old.

According to the ex-model, she and Cosby were in his Elvis Suite at the Hilton Hotel when he offered her two drinks and proceeded to pet her hair.

A short time later she passed out, but she remembered the color of the walls in the room and a flood of bright light.

Gloria Allred, who represents the two women, along with seven other Cosby accusers, said Brown and Lublin have decided to come forward years later because they were concerned for their reputations and afraid to take on the wealthy and powerful comedian.

Allred reminded reporters that while it was too late to hold Cosby accountable for Lublin's alleged assault, he could still face criminal prosecution in Canada, where there is no statute of limitations.

The high-profile attorney also revealed that she knows more women who may be willing to come forward with accusations against him in the future. 

Cosby's lawyer has called those and similar claims 'discredited' and 'defamatory.'
