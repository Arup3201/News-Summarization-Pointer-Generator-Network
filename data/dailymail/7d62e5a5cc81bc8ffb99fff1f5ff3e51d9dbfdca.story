The Queen's estate could face prosecution by the Health and Safety Executive after a worker nearly drowned at Sandringham.

Emergency services were called to the Norfolk retreat at about 1.30pm yesterday after reports that the estate worker, in his 30s, had fallen in to the Lower Lake while operating a ride-on lawn mower.

It is understood the Queen was at Sandringham on a private visit less than an hour later.

He was flown by an East Anglia Air 
Ambulance helicopter to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, with what 
were described as life-threatening injuries.

A spokesman for Norfolk Police said: 'The man was retrieved from the water and was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital by air ambulance for treatment. He is currently described as being in a critical condition.

'Police and the Health and Safety Executive are carrying out a joint investigation into the incident.'

The Queen was yesterday holding a private meeting in her garden at Sandringham with local members of the Welsh Corgi League.

Lower Lake is next to the Estate Office, also known as York Cottage. The converted house was the residence of King George V.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman is reported to have confirmed that the Queen is being kept aware of details of the incident.

A Norfolk Police spokesman confirmed that a 999 call was initially made to the ambulance service which then informed police.

Firefighters were also sent to the 20,000 acre estate where the Royal family gather every Christmas.

Gillian Legerton, branch secretary of
the East Anglia sub section of the Welsh Corgi League, said the Queen 
had earlier met up with 63 club members and 48 of their dogs.

The
Queen, a well known Corgi lover and patron of the league, chatted with 
members and petted their dogs for around half an hour.

Miss
Legerton of Saffron Walden, Essex, said: 'Once we left the Queen, we 
went to the visitors’ centre area and then we saw all these ambulances 
and fire engines.

'All the emergency services were rushing around, but we did not know what was happening.

'It
is about the third or fourth time we have been up to Sandringham to 
visit Her Majesty. She likes to pet and stroke the dogs and we all have a
nice time. She was in excellent spirits.'

'I am just sorry that somebody is now poorly in hospital.'

The
lake, which is around 200m wide with an island in the middle, is the 
largest of four inter-connected lakes and ponds in the grounds of 
Sandringham House.

A
spokesman for the East Anglian Air Ambulance said the man had been 
flown to Addenbrooke’s Hospital with 'life-threatening' injuries.
