Kit Kats for one cent, razors for 50 cents and toothpaste for $1 - these are the crazy brand name sales up for grabs as a new online retailer heats up the supermarket price war.

Online retailer Kogan.com, which is known for selling cheap electronics, is taking on supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths with a new grocery delivery site and promises to cut 50 percent off the price of weekly groceries. 

Kogan Pantry, which stocks non-perishable food items, household cleaning products and beauty and personal care, launched earlier this month.

Consumer group Choice has backed the new grocery site saying products they compared on Kogan were about 40 to 50 percent cheaper than equivalent products at Coles or Woolworths.

The site has Kit Kats on sale for $0.01 and women's Schick razors for just $0.50. 

Colgate sensitive toothpaste is $1, Radiant (1.5kg) is $6 and BAM cleaner is on sale for $0.99. 

Founder and CEO Ruslan Kogan said the site was able to provide discounts by cutting out the middle man and selling directly to the consumer, news.com.au reports.

'We knew there was a lot of negative sentiment around supermarkets in Australia, we knew people didn't like them very much, but we had no idea to what extent,' Mr Kogan said.

'It feels great when we can take it to the big two.'

Laundry products 

Radiant Laundry Powder (1.5kg) – Kogan: $6.92. Coles: $11

Vanish Napisan Plus (1kg) – Kogan: $3.80. Woolworths: (2kg) $13.96 or $6.98/kilo

Razors 

Gilette Mach razor blades (10 pack) – Kogan: $19 or $1.90 each. Woolworths: (12 pack) $36.55 or $3.05 each

Batteries 

Duracell Duralock AAA Batteries (4 pack) – Kogan: $2.96. Coles:  $5.50

Rice

Tilda Steamed Rice Brown Mushroom (250g) – Kogan: $2.54. Coles: $3.74. Woolworths: $2.00 (on special)

But where Kogan Pantry differs from Coles and Woolworths is the site doesn't offer the full product range and doesn't offer fruit or vegetables. 

The site currently offers between 500 to 600 products.

Mr Kogan says his site still offers brands that customers want, including Dove, Colgate, Palmolive, Pringles, Powerade and Gillette.

The products on Kogan Pantry also carry a disclaimer saying they may be parallel imports, which means it may be an international variation and may differ from local products.

Radiant laundry powder (1.5kg) is on sale via Kogan Pantry for $6 and BAM cleaner for $0.99

Colgate sensitive has been slashed from $9.60 to just $1, according to the website

Choice compared the cost of products on Kogan to the online stores of Coles and Woolworths and found in various instances the price was nearly 50 percent less. 

But they also said consumers may get a better price if products were on sale in the supermarkets.

While Kogan Pantry offers unlimited products for a fixed delivery rate of $9.99, Choice points out delivery takes longer than Coles and Woolworths. 

'As long as you are happy to pay your $9.99 delivery fee and are happy with the fact that it might take a little longer to arrive, the prices are pretty hard to beat,' Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey.
