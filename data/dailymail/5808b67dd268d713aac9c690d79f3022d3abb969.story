Martin Bell has been jailed for at least 12 years for the brutal killing of Gemma Simpson, whose body was not found for 14 years

A family of a woman who was attacked with a hammer before having her leg sawn off have been left furious after her killer was ordered to serve just 12 years behind bars.

Martin Bell, 45, said God told him to kill 23-year-old Gemma Simpson when she was at his flat in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, 14 years ago in May 2000.

Today, Judge Peter Collier QC said Bell's prison term was limited by the laws at the time and the fact Bell pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Speaking outside court, Miss Simpson's father, Glenn, said he was 'disgusted' by the sentence, but did not blame the judge.

He believes Bell manipulated the legal system and says he hopes Bell  'rots' for what he has done.

Mr Simpson said: 'He brutally killed Gemma - our Gemma - and left her buried in the ground for 14 years. We served that 14 years. He has 11 (left) to serve. We believe he has manipulated the system.'

Jailing Bell for a minimum 12 years at Leeds Crown Court today, Judge Collier said: 'The killing of Gemma Simpson was brutal. Your treatment of her body after death was dreadful. But your culpability was considerably diminished by your mental illness.'

The court heard Bell had been sectioned in a mental hospital for around nine months in August 1999 and was released around six weeks before he killed Miss Simpson.

Simon Myerson QC, prosecuting, told the court Bell launched a 'frenzied' attack in which he repeatedly struck Miss Simpson with a hammer and then stabbed her in the back and neck an 'uncountable' number of times with a kitchen knife.

Bell then filled a bath with water and left Miss Simpson in it for four days with her hands tied behind her back because he was 'frightened she would come back to life'.

Mr Myerson said Bell closed the shower curtain so he did not have to see the body and repainted his flat with lilac paint to cover the blood stains.

He hired a car but found  he could not fit Miss Simpson's body in the boot, so he sawed off the bottom of his victim's legs.

Bell, who has been diagnosed with a psychotic illness, told police he did this 'as fast as I could so I wasn't sick'.

He wrapped Miss Simpson's body in a sleeping bag and secured it with chains and a padlock 'so she couldn't get out'.

Bell then drove her to Brimham Rocks, near Harrogate, North Yorkshire, where he dug a hole with a shovel and buried her.

Mr Myerson told the court that Bell, who was 30 at the time of the attack, had known Miss Simpson for around five years.

On the day of her death, the pair met at Leeds railway station before going back to Bell's flat in Harrogate.

Bell was questioned by police after Miss Simpson was reported missing and said the young woman had called him to ask if she could stay with him but he had not seen her that day.

In July this year, Bell rang a former girlfriend and told her he had killed someone 14 years ago. He then handed himself in at Scarborough police station.

During his interviews, Bell took police to Brimham Rocks and showed them where he had buried Miss Simpson, and her remains were recovered.

He said he had visited the site four or fives times since Miss Simpson's death.

Bell told police he had considered confessing in the past but his mother was still alive and he was concerned about losing his freedom.

Paul Greaney QC, defending Bell, told the court the defendant heard voices telling him to do things and had 'developed complex delusional beliefs' which saw him moving around the country because he believed a group of men were trying to kill him.

Mr Greaney said the doctor who discharged Bell in 2000 accepted that the delusions had not disappeared at that stage.

A psychiatric report carried out after Bell's arrest diagnosed his mental illness as schizophrenia.

Judge Collier earlier told the court it was a difficult and unique sentencing exercise as he had to consider the law as it was 14 years ago and, also, the fact that Bell is not currently showing the psychotic illness he was suffering from at the time.

The judge also noted he has not committed any acts of serious violence since he killed Miss Simpson.Â 

Emma's father, who was comforted by his daughter Naomi Carrick, said outside court: 'All we can say now is we hope he rots.'

Police searched Bell's home in Harrogate, North Yorkshire after he confided to a friend about the killing

The family issued a statement through West Yorkshire Police which said: 'Gemma was a young woman in the prime of her life who raised a smile and lit up every room she entered.

'Her family will never come to terms with the loss of Gemma. We are victims as well.'

They added: 'There is no sentence which can be imposed which will reduce the pain and suffering Martin Bell has caused Gemma's family during the past 14 years, whilst all the time he was leading a normal life.

'He left us in limbo for each one of those years. A total of nearly 5,000 days of pain in which we worried constantly for Gemma and her wellbeing.

'That chill in our hearts became an integral, perpetual part of our lives and the knowledge that Bell could watch all of our and the police's efforts to find her while going on with his own affairs for so long quite simply beggars belief.

'While we now know what happened to our daughter, there is a shadow on our lives which will never be lifted and Bell is the cause of that.

'Our beautiful Gemma was a bright shining light in our world. A light which Martin Bell extinguished.'
