Big Brother winner Helen Wood unwittingly led police to her firearms fugitive lover after he left the country for Cyprus and she then went there on holiday, a court heard.

Louis Larsson, 29, was released halfway through a five-year prison sentence but then went on the run to the Mediterranean.

But he was arrested after police followed Miss Wood, 27, to his hideout a year later, Bolton Crown Court heard.

His ex-girlfriend won Big Brother 2014 last month vowing to use the £100,000 prize to put her past problems behind her.

Manhunt: Big Brother winner Helen Wood unwittingly led police to her firearms fugitive lover Louis Larsson after she headed to Cyprus for a break at his hideout

She first came to public attention after allegedly sleeping with footballer Wayne Rooney in 2010 ahead of the World Cup in South Africa while his wife Coleen was pregnant. 

Larsson, who has also used the surname Kettle, was jailed in October 2010, after pleading guilty to possession of firearm parts and reactivation equipment.

But after being released on licence, he went abroad in May last year, breaching the terms of his licence.

Detectives finally caught up with him just under a year later, thanks to Miss Wood's holiday.

Geoff Whelan, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant fled the jurisdiction and was arrested on an international arrest warrant in Cyprus in spring this year.

'Police followed his girlfriend Helen, who gained notoriety in Big Brother, and arrested him there.'

It is understood Miss Wood is no longer in a relationship with Larsson.

He was arrested in Paphos in Cyprus in April 2014, after a joint investigation between Greater Manchester Police, Cypriot police and the National Crime Agency to track him down.

Larsson was returned to HMP Forest Bank to serve the remainder of his five-year sentence and, yesterday, he was given a further 20-month sentence, to run alongside his current sentence, for two fresh charges of possession of ammunition, to which he pleaded guilty.

These related to a raid at a house in  Little Lever, in May, 2013, the same month that he fled the country.

The court heard that police found a working cannabis farm inside the terraced house, although neither the defendant nor anybody else has ever been charged in relation to the discovery.

Two rounds of ammunition were found on a shelf in the kitchen.

They were found to contain all the ingredients to make ammunition and one fired while the other misfired.

Other components, including bullets and casings, were found with Larsson's fingerprints on them.

They had been ordered from an online dealer, who informed the police that Larsson had placed the order.

David Bentley, defending, said Larsson had long been interested in military memorabilia and already has a job in the dental industry lined up for when he leaves prison.

He said: 'Of the two that were recovered, one misfired, which was expected.

'One fired and the defendant showed a great deal of surprise that this occured although he accepts culpability.'

Judge Timothy Clayson said: 'This sentence will not add to your current sentence but with convictions like this behind you, if you put so much as even the smallest foot out of line in the future in relation to firearms you can expect absolutely no mercy at the hands of the court.'

Larsson was acquitted of three counts of conspiracy to possess firearms in July after he was accused of bringing firearms to The Lancashire Gunroom for its owner Cyrus Shahabi-Shack to sell.

Larsson will not be released before April 29, 2016.

Miss Wood was unavailable for comment.
