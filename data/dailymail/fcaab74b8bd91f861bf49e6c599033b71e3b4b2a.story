A 90-year-old Icelandic man who lost his wedding ring in 1949 has had it returned just in time to celebrate his 65th wedding anniversary.

Oskar Jonsson from Dalvik, a village in northern Iceland, had lost the wedding ring given to him by wife Elin Sigureoardottir, 85, just after they were married, and thought that it had fallen off on the road while he was clearing the snow.

But in reality he had taken the ring off to do some repairs on machinery at his garage, and had placed it on a wooden ruler before forgetting about it. 

Still together: Oskar Jonsson had lost the wedding ring given to him by wife Elin Sigureoardottir just after they were married

The ruler had fallen behind the table, and remained there for the next 64 years until new garage owner Brynjar Aeoalsteinsson had called in workers to clean out the junk.

He said: 'The place was a complete mess and I wanted it done up and made to look nice and they took everything out that was on the floor. 

'One of the young lads that was cleaning up asked me if I'd seen the ruler, and I glanced at it but didn't immediately see the ring.

'It was only when I looked at it more closely did I see there was a ring and realised it was probably a wedding ring because of the inscription "Your Elin".'

Lost and found: Jonsson lost his wedding ring in 1949, but had it returned just in time to celebrate his 65th wedding anniversary to wife Elin Sigureoardottir

He contacted local jewellers and advertised the wedding ring on Facebook and eventually it was suggested that the woman named might be Elin Sigureoardottir.

Oskar said: 'I couldn't believe it when he gave me the ring. I had wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary in November last year by giving her a ring but I was not very well so that plan was put on hold.'

But now the couple have had their celebration complete with ring in style.

Oscar added: 'The ring is as good as new, although I will have to wear it on a different finger. I lost my ring finger in an accident with a saw a short while after I lost the ring, and I never wore a ring after that ever again. Still, better late than never.'
