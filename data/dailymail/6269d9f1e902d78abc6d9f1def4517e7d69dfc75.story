Mental health disorders such as depression and work-related stress are now the leading cause of long-term sickness absence in working-age Australians.

The absences, many of them permanent, are costing the economy more than $12 billion a year in lost productivity and disability benefits and the risks are just as inherent in teachers and lawyers as they are in front-line emergency service workers.

But one Australian group aligned with mental health advocacy is helping treat the 1.4 million Australians coping with the disorder - by introducing new workplace programs to combat increased stress levels.

Sam Harvey is helping workplaces better cope with the stigma associated with mental health

Workplace Mental Health Researcher Sam Harvey from the Black Dog Institute is teaming up with employers to manage staff stress levels.

Firefighters are on the front-line coping with trauma

He, along with a team of researchers from the university of NSW, have identified a number of interventions that are effective in reducing significant mental illness for working-age Australians.

'Consider workplace health promotion strategies that include both physical activity incentives and mental health awareness and education,' he said. 

He said people in occupations with regular exposure to traumatic events, such the police, paramedics, fire fighters, military personnel, medical staff and journalists have historically been associated with post traumatic stress.

His team is helping reduce this - by way of  therapy and relaxation training at the place where people spend 'one-half of their waking lives' - at work.

Along with in-house workplace counselling and the provision of formal return to work programs for people recovering from mental illness, he said the programs are showing to have an effect in reducing depression.

Mr Harvey said employers often do not know how to cope with the issue of mental health in the workplace.

'It is easy for employers to recognise a physical illness, for instance someone who has hurt there leg,' he said.

'They get a get well card and an office on the ground floor.'

'But for someone coming back from depression they (employers and colleagues) don't how to speak to them.'

Other experiences such as marital distress, financial strain or dependent children can exacerbate work stress and result in strain, illness and sickness absence.

In addition, other issues such as substance misuse, poor diet and limited exercise may be directly or indirectly related to either the organisation culture or personal choices.

Emergency Service personnel area the highest risk of suffering mental health issues

But despite how bad the workplace might be, Mr Harvey said the impact of unemployment on mental health is much worse.

During the Global Financial Crisis, Dr Harvey said the rate of suicide in America and Europe was inflated quite dramatically as a result of job losses and financial insecurity.

Some 5000 additional suicides were committed by people across America and Europe in 2008 - the year the GFC hit. In Australia, the problem was less severe.

In Australia issues such as 'downsizing corporations,' highlighted most recently by the closure of Holden's Australian arm, are adding to mental health stress on working-aged Australians.

In the northern suburbs of Adelaide, at the company's Elizabeth plant, the rate of youth unemployment is already at 44 per cent and the city as a whole experienced 209 deaths by suicide in 2011 - the ABS reported.

He said the risk of suicide is greater if people have been dismissed from their job - without finding another in a 12 month period.

'Involuntary job loss also increases the risk of suicide and attempted suicide,' he said.

Adding that while front-line emergency service workers such as doctors and nurses are among the biggest risk groups, those employed in other 'highly demanding jobs' where there is a mismatch between effort and reward are also not immune.

'This is highly prevalent in teachers and lawyers and elements of the public sector.'
