A German biathlete and an Italian bobsledder have been thrown out of the Winter Olympics after both testing positive for banned substances.

Italian officials announced that 
bobsledder William Frullani tested positive for the substance 
dymetylpentylamine, also found in nasal decongestants, and has left the 
village.

The head of Germany’s Olympic body, meanwhile, announced tonight that former two-time Olympic gold medalist Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle was removed from the team after testing positive for a banned stimulant in two samples.

She blames the test on a nutritional supplement, saying she never knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs.

Michael Vesper, chief of German Olympic body DOSB, said the news rocked the German Olympic team.

‘Of course we were shocked by the news and the mood in our Olympic team was clearly very bad. We are absolutely in favour of team sport and against any kind of manipulation,’ he said.

‘This is why - before the games and during the games - we took action. We also acted quickly and decisively now in accordance with the athletes' agreement, an agreement that we have concluded with Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle.’

Italian officials, meanwhile, said they had got the green light from the International Olympic Committee to replace Frullani in their four-man bobsleigh team with the competition starting on Saturday.

‘The Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) now needs to sort out the composition of the bobsleigh team which Frullani was part of, to make it back up to four,’ CONI said in a statement.

‘They have requested that the athlete be replaced with the reserve Samuele Romanini and clearance for this has been received from the IOC.’

Flavio Roda, the president of the Italian Winter Sports Federation (FISI), condemned Frullani for showing a ‘lack of respect to his team mates’.

‘It is a great disappointment because these are things that shouldn't happen in sport and also because our federation has always condemned doping,’ he said.

‘We still have to see what exactly happened. It is a bit premature to give a judgement, but what is for sure is that what is being done by this athlete is unacceptable.

‘I don't know exactly what this product is. It is a product which doesn't enhance your output so it is even more annoying because it makes me think “how stupid”.

‘If someone looks for something that is not natural to enhance their ability we need to condemn this in any way we can, and as a federation we can only condemn what he has done.’

Until Friday, Russia's first Winter Games had not had a positive doping case.
