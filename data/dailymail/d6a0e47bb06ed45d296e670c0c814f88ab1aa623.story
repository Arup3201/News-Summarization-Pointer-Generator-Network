The cost of the Foreign Secretary using VIP airport suites was more than £100,000 over four years, with William Hague holding the position for most of that time 

The Foreign Office has spent more than £2million on VIP airport suites in four years, figures show.

Between 2010 and 2014 its total bill for using exclusive lounges at home and abroad was almost £2.4million.

Just over £2million went on providing VIP services for visiting foreign dignitaries, while the cost of the Foreign Secretary using them amounted to more than £100,000 over the four years. 

William Hague held the position from May 2010 until July this year.

The figures were published on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website in a response to a freedom of information request. 

They showed that the FCO’s overall spending on using airport VIP lounges almost halved in 2013/14 compared to the previous year. 

The bulk of the FCO’s spending on the lounges was for visits by foreign heads of state and other dignitaries.

The bill for overseas guests was highest in 2010/11 and 2011/12, with a total of £669,019.68 and £715,157.76 spent in those years respectively.

It fell to £489,953.96 in 2012/13 and £197,444.00 in the most recent 12-month period.

Two payments of £100,000 in 2012/13 and 2013/14 for a contract to use the Royal Suite at Heathrow made up the rest of the total.

The response said: 'In November 2012 we reviewed our position on the use of VIP suites and as a result moved away from part owning the Heathrow Royal Suite to becoming a contracted customer for private flights.

'This represented better value for money and greater freedom to use other facilities. Our contract with Heathrow Airport Limited costs the FCO £100,000 per annum, in return for 50 private flight movements with exclusive rights to the suite whenever required.” 

The Heathrow VIP website says departing guests enjoy an 'oasis of calm' in a private lounge before being chauffeur driven directly to the aircraft.

Arriving passengers are greeted by staff before being 'whisked away by luxury vehicle' to their private lounge.
