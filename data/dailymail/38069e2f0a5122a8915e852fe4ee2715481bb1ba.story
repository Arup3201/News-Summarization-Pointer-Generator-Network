Girls in aristocratic circles have long attended finishing schools to polish their manners, their deportment and their accents.

Wealthy families in the UK have traditionally sent their fledgling society ladies off to schools to learn the intricacies of a thoroughbred upbringing - both Princess Diana and the Duchess of Cornwall both attended finishing schools in Switzerland - but it is not a solely British preserve.

Indeed, wealthy women in China are so eager to emulate the manners of the aristocracy that they are willing to spend thousands of pounds on finishing schools to help them get there.

The new Institute Sarita in Beijing describes itself as ‘China’s leading finishing school, bringing you first-hand experience to help you become more poised and polished, taking your social and professional success to the next level.’

Stemming from the massive influx of wealth in China in the last decades and the new cultural revolution, the notoriously polite Chinese are travelling globally and wanting to make the right impression.

Sarah Jane Ho's courses cost up to £10,400 for two weeks of training, and vary according to marital status

Aspiring social climbers can pick 
from two main types of course: the Debutante, for unmarried women aged 
16 and above, or the Hostessing course for married women.

The courses go into incredible detail on every possible scenario a woman may come across in social situations, from peeling an orange to eating a oyster. The lessons even cover how to pronounce the names of luxury design houses.

The
 Debutante course lasts for 10 days and promises to teach single women 
'high-end social etiquette and protocol', including history, social, and
 business customs of different cultures and countries around the world, 
greetings and introductions, business card exchange, dress code, table 
manners, dining and entertaining, conversational dos and don’ts and gift 
giving.

 A knife should be held firmly in your right hand, with the handle tucked into your palm, your thumb down one side of the handle and your index finger along the top (but never touching the top of the blade). It should never be eaten off or held like a pencil.

When used with a knife or spoon, the fork should be held in the left hand, in much the same way as the knife, with the prongs facing downwards. On its own, it is held in the right hand, with the prongs facing upwards, resting on the fingers and secured with the thumb and index finger.

A spoon is held in the right hand, resting on the fingers and secured with the thumb and index finger. Food should be eaten off the side of the spoon; it should never be used at a right angle to the mouth.

Also taught are floral art and table decoration, public relations, psychology and personal presentation.

The Hostessing course, which takes place over 14 full days, starting at 9am and finishing at 6pm each day covers the 'art of being a hostess', which includes high-end social etiquette, including understanding the behaviour and customs of high society and dining around the world.

It also teaches the history, tasting and service of tea and coffee, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, dressing definitions, personal stationery and invitation cards, body language, rules of official and diplomatic protocol, and hotel and restaurant manners. 

The Institute states that: 'Our courses are designed to give you the opportunity to achieve a greater understanding of other cultures and better interpersonal communication.

'Every principle discussed is well supported by practice, so that being an elegant lady or confident business executive becomes second nature to you.'

A two-week course at the newly opened Institute Sarita in Beijing costs 100,000 yuan, or about £10,411, and while some may question spending such a large sum, the courses are proving popular.

The institute was founded and is run by Sara Jane Ho.

A graduate from both Georgetown University and Havard Business School who speaks five languages, she herself attended the prestigious finishing school Institut Villa Pierrefeu in Switzerland where she gained her diploma in International Etiquette & Protocol.

Sarah says: 'Everyone needs to study etiquette, no matter who you are. It should allow you to be a better version of yourself.'
