A pilot on Russian national airline Aeroflot is facing investigation after using a cockpit message to passengers to brand Ukrainians 'filth' while flying over the country.

Despite admitting the captain had used the offensive language and 'violated our internal regulations', the state-run carrier did not apologise for the outburst.

A Slovak diplomat tweeted a complaint on 9 August about the extraordinary language from the plane's unnamed pilot on a flight from Moscow to Vienna.

Outrage: The pilot of an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Vienna sparked outrage with his incendiary comments

Controversial: He made a joke about the war-era activist Stepan Bandera - a Ukrainian hero; a Russian nemesis

'En route by Aeroflot to VIE, captain to passengers: 'We fly over remnants of Ukraine, where Banderovtsi and other fifth lives,' wrote Martin Kaco, Counsellor at the political department of Slovak embassy in Moscow.

The pilot's words referred to Stepan Bandera, seen as a fascist by many Russians for colluding with Nazi Germany but a hero by many Ukrainians for seeking an independent state not controlled by Moscow.

In the current dispute in Ukraine, his name is often used by Russians to denigrate pro-Western Ukrainians seeking to ally the country with the EU.

Aeroflot last night did not apologise for the words but admitted an investigation was underway.

The airline tweeted five days after the complaint: 'We've studied your message. The fact was confirmed.

'The pilot had no right to express his personal opinion while on duty.

'In Aeroflot we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots.

Powering ahead: This morning the convoy was 280 miles from the Ukrainian border, set to arrive later today

'In this case the pilot has violated our internal regulations.

'We have started the internal investigation. Thank you for your information.'

Meanwhile, controversy has ensued over a Russian convoy of trucks supposedly transporting aid to the Ukrainian border.

Critics claim the vehicles could be containing weapons, and warn of a potential attack.

The Kiev government today insisted on enforcing its own checks at the border on the cargo - threatening dire consequences if it could not.

A spokesman for Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said last night that the only way to avoid a confrontation would be for the Russians to give over the whole contents of the convoy to Kiev inspectors.

He said: 'We have three scenarios. The first - the direct invasion to the territory of Ukraine under the guise of the delivery of aid.' 

'The second - a provocation in the Kharkiv region with a high degree of possibility of the use of force and military aggression of Russia.

'The third option - help for Lugansk passes through the checkpoint, which is closest to the city. We provide our customs control, scanning cargo, together with representatives of the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe - a monitoring organisation).'
