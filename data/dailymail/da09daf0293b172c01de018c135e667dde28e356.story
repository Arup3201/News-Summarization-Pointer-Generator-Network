Shafilea Ahmed's decomposed remains were discovered in Cumbria in 2004 and her parents are now on trial for her murder

Shafilea Ahmed's sister today denied telling a friend she should 'give police her diaries' if anything happened to her after she was arrested on suspicion of stealing from the family home.

Mevish Ahmed, 21, also told the jury she had not told Shahin Munir that her parents had threatened to kill her.

Her parents Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and his wife Farzana, 49, are standing trial accused of killing their daughter Shafilea at home in Warrington, 
Cheshire, in September 2003.

The trial has already heard from their second child, Alesha, that they hit Shafilea and then suffocated her with a plastic bag in 
front of the other children.

But taking to the stand at Chester Crown Court yesterday, Mevish said an account of the teenager being murdered by their strict Muslim parents was 'fiction'. She was 12 at the time her older sister disappeared.

Today she denied that she had ever been beaten by her parents - and said she had merely fallen outside the house as she gave evidence for a second day.

Andrew Edis QC, prosecuting, told the jury about an incident in April 2009 when she was arrested on suspicion of stealing money from the family home.

He said: 'You spoke to Shahin and told her that afterwards you were beaten by your mother and your father, thrown on the floor and they said that you should go to Pakistan right now and talked about finishing you and threatened to kill you.'

Miss Ahmed replied: 'No, I fell outside the house.'

The prosecution claims that Miss Ahmed had fallen out with her parents but 'returned to the family' after they promised to withdraw the theft allegation.

Mr Edis said: 'You had been arrested and investigated for the theft of £600 from your own house and you said (to Miss Munir), "I'm going back home, if anything happens to me give police the diary".'

Miss Ahmed replied: 'I don't recall that at all.'

Yesterday, the jury heard extracts of writings made by Miss Ahmed and given to Miss Munir which appeared to corroborate statements her sister Alesha earlier made to the court about Shafilea's treatment by her parents and the night of her death.

Evidence: Mevish Ahmed, sister of Shafilea Ahmed, today denied telling her friend to hand her diaries to police if anything happened to her

Miss Ahmed described the documents as 'free writing' and said they were all pieces of 'fiction'.

The accounts were written by Mevish in
2008 and given to a friend, Shahin Munir, Chester Crown Court heard. 
Prosecutor Andrew Edis suggested that if the documents had a title, it 
would be: ‘How my parents killed my sister.’

In one extract, Mevish says: ‘Three times she ran but they got her.’

A second extract read to the court included the sentences: ‘She didn’t do nothing. Shouting, time after time. What did she do?

‘That’s it, space of one to two minutes – gone.’

Alesha,
the chief prosecution witness, has told the jury that Shafilea 
repeatedly ran away from home to escape the violence she claims their 
parents meted out.

She also told how in September 2003 
her parents pushed Shafilea on to the settee in their house in 
Warrington, Cheshire. The couple then forced a plastic bag into the 
teenager’s mouth and suffocated her in front of the other children, she 
said.

Alesha told of watching the couple 
sorting through bin bags and rolls of tape after the alleged killing – 
before seeing her father leave the house carrying a dark package.

Mr Edis suggested to Mevish that her writings ‘look like an allegation of murder against your parents’.

But she replied: ‘No, it is not based on me or my family. It is just chat – just random stuff.’

She also described her writings as ‘just a story’ and added: ‘I used the names but that doesn’t mean it is about us.’

Mevish met Miss Munir in a park in 
August 2008 – when she had a drug problem – the court heard.

Miss Munir 
wrote a record of what she said Mevish told her. This was read to the 
jury. It began: ‘They sat her down in a chair and her Dad went mad.

Family home: The Ahmeds lived in this house in Warrington, Cheshire. Shafilea's remains were discovered in Cumbria in 2004

‘He started proper hitting her. Mevish tried to stop it but her Mum pushed her away.

‘They used the plastic bag to suffocate her and one or two minutes, she was gone.’

Mevish insisted to the court the account was fiction or ‘free writing’.

She admitted asking Miss Munir to return the documents but said her friend had kept photocopies.

Earlier she denied witnessing her parents killing her sister.

Her parents, from Warrington, deny murder.

The case continues.
