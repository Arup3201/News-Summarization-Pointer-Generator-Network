Companions: But Little Joshua Carnegie had to be told his 'best friend' Tic Toc the pony is missing

A mother had to break the news to her five-year-old son that his pony has been stolen after crooks failed to return it in time for Christmas.

Tic Toc, an adorable white Welsh Shetland cross, disappeared from his field on December 6.

The 24-year-old has little value, suffers from the ageing condition Cushings disease, and needs daily medication for dietary problems.

He belongs to Catriona Carnegie whose son Joshua has grown up with him and rides him every week in the summer.

Catriona, 30, and husband Andrew, 36, a business manager, could not bring themselves to tell little Joshua that his beloved Tic Toc was missing.

Friends and locals offered a £6,000 reward if Tic Toc is returned to his field in Ramsey St Mary, Cambridgeshire, before Christmas.

But the thieves have failed to do the honest thing - leaving the parents no choice but to break the news to Joshua.

Catriona, who keeps 20 horses, said: 'Josh is absolutely devastated.

'He has grown up with Tic Toc, they are best friend. Last year he wrote a letter to Father Christmas asking him to make Tic Toc better because he knows he's on medication for his feet.

'He talks about Tic Toc all the time, he's been asking why he hasn't seen him, when he can visit him and when he can ride him.

'I didn't want to tell Josh that Tic Toc has been stolen but I've had to tell him that he's not living with us anymore.

'I said he's gone to retirement home because his feet are bad and hopefully he might come back to us. He is absolutely devastated, he's heartbroken. All we want is to have Tic Toc back for Christmas.'

Tic Toc is 11 hands tall with a thick curly coat especially on his legs and a pink muzzle with black speckles. He is unshod and unfreeze-marked.

When he was taken he was wearing a blue Rambo rug with purple trim.

The fencing was intact and three gates to his field were shut when Catriona discovered he was missing so she is convinced he was stolen.

Friends and supporters have carried out extensive searches for Tic Toc including a sweep by a helicopter with a thermal camera.

The
 family's Facebook group has almost 14,000 members who have reported 
hundreds of potential sightings from across the country hoping one will 
be Tic Toc.

Celebrities 
including sports presenter Clare Balding, Olympians Zara Phillips and 
Charlotte Dujardin, Strictly star Deborah Meaden, comic Eddie Izzard and
 chef Gordon Ramsey are also helping the search by tweeting.

Cathy
 Hyde, chief equine inspector at the RSPCA, said: 'It's absolutely 
heartbreaking, Tic Toc is obviously a much-loved part of the family and 
we want to see him back where he belongs as quickly as possible.

'Without
 his medication Tic Toc could suffer severe dietary problems including 
colic so it's absolutely essential that he's returned for his own health
 and welfare.

'The RSPCA's 
equine inspectors have all got Tic Toc's details and are keeping an eye 
out for him on their travels, we have also shared the information with 
some of our partner charities and equine experts.

'It's
 great that so many people are looking for this little pony, we 
sincerely hope he'll be back with his family for Christmas.'

The theft has been reported to Cambridgeshire police.
