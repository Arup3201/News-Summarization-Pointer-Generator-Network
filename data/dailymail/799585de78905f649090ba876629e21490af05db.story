Business analyst Karl Howes, who drove into a lamppost after a night of heavy drinking and was so drunk he died of alcohol poisoning as he lay in the wreckage of his BMW

A business analyst who crashed his car after a night out was so drunk he died of alcohol poisoning as he lay in the wreckage of his BMW.

Company high flyer Karl Howes, 34, ploughed into two vehicles and left a trail of destruction before flipping his own company car onto its roof when it hit a lamppost at 50mph.

Despite the impact Mr Howes suffered no life threatening injuries but when police arrived at the scene he had already died as a result of 'acute alcohol intoxication' due to the estimated nine pints of lager and 'several' spirit shots he had drank.

Friends who saw him in the run up to the crash said Mr Howes was acting 'like a zombie' but was still able to hug and talk to them.

It is believed the grammar school and university educated keep fit fanatic, passed away shortly after the impact in Bingley, near Bradford, West Yorkshire.

On December 20 last year after he consumed three pints of 
lager with friends at a work Christmas do in Bingley before meeting 
girlfriend Jodie Coonan, 29, an inquest heard.

He
 drank another six pints and spirit shots and planned to leave the black
 car and get a cab but the couple became separated and Mr Howes decided 
to drive home.

As
 he did so, his vehicle careered into a bus shelter, hit an oncoming car
 and then subsequently swerved into a parked vehicle to his left.

Friends
 stopped Karl at scene of his first collisions with the bus shelter, to 
urge him not to drive, describing him 'like a zombie' - but he ignored 
them.

A
 short distance later, he hit the pavement outside a school and swerved 
into a lamppost which catapulted his car upside down. The impact left 
the lamppost leaning on a tree.

PC
 Paul Lightowler of West Yorkshire Police said: 'Karl had the company 
car from new. He had been out with a friend for a Christmas party at a 
pub. He was observed to consume three pints of lager and then Karl drove
 them back to Bingley.

'He
 parked the vehicle with intention of collecting it the next day but he 
and his partner became separated and couldn’t reach each other by phone 
despite a number of calls.'

Despite the impact Mr Howes suffered no life threatening injuries but when police arrived at the scene he had already died as a result of 'acute alcohol intoxication' due to the nine pints of lager and the spirits he drank

He added: 'Karl
 got into a BMW to drive home. He is seen on CCTV getting in the vehicle
 and driving along the main street in Bingley, slowly and meandering.

'He stopped in a layby for some unknown reason then is seen reversing and he collided with a glass bus shelter.'

Two
 people Mr Howes knew came to assist him and asked him not to continue 
driving but he hugged them, got back in his car and carried on.

PC
 Lightowler added: 'He left the bus stop travelling at a high speed. He 
then collided with a white VW. The driver did stop but no damage was 
done to his vehicle.

'When
 he hit this car he moved to the left of the carriage way where he hit 
another BMW vehicle which caused some damage but Karl did not stop and 
carried on driving. We can see from footage that he accelerated away 
from the incident.

'At
 1.40am an onlooker saw the car coming past at 50pmh and it seemed to 
be swerving. The vehicle then hit the pavement, a grass verge, before 
effectively using a lamppost as a ramp which turned it on its roof.'

A
 post-mortem test recorded superficial lacerations to the back of Mr 
Howes’ head and forearm but acute alcoholic intoxication was recorded as
 cause of death.

PC
 Lightowler said of the test results: 'I have never seen situation like 
this. It is very unique.

'It seems that such a significant event to 
happen at the time he died are linked together for me.'

Ms
 Coonan, 29, told the hearing: 'When I first met Karl he used to go out 
on a Wednesday night to a Sunday night drinking.

'He would work those 
days but would go out in the evenings drinking around four or five 
pints. And all weekend he would drink.

'That
 did get lower and lower as I knew him. He wouldn’t really be drunk 
after five pints. When I saw him that night you could tell he had been 
drinking but he was not stumbling.'

He was formerly a national executive at the greeting cards firm Hallmark. It was 
claimed he suffered bouts of depression due to his 'high-pressure' 
career path and began binge drinking and gambling heavily in 2010 
following an inquiry into his company expenses.

Mr
 Howes’ GP Dr Russell Livingstone told the Bradford hearing: 'He was 
binge drinking in excess. He was offered support and counselling. He was
 suffering from anxiety symptoms.

'He worked hard to maintain responsibility but explained he was exhausted from working "silly hours".

'He was developing negative thoughts and concerned about work. He remained agitated about the expenses action.'

'In
 September 2010 he was put on anti-depressants and continued to have 
peaks of feeling better and being anxious about the pressures of work.

'After
 a period out of work in 2011 Karl was phased back before being made 
redundant which he felt was handled badly,' added the GP.

In January 2012 Mr Howes got a new job as a business analyst with a Bradford baking company Speedibake and was dealing with multi-million pound contracts and appeared to be happier.

Recording a narrative verdict Bradford assistant coroner Dominic Bell accepted the post mortem findings but concluded Mr Howes’ death was 'attributed to a road crash attributed to the use of alcohol'.
