Newcastle

Rob Elliot 6

Only had one save to make before thigh injury forced him off at half-time.

Daryl Janmaat 7.5

Athletic and aggressive, the Holland international eventually got to grips with Hazard. Could be the signing of the summer.

Steven Taylor 7.5

Two brilliant blocks inside the goalmouth at 0-0. Had been immense until red card for reckless lunge on Schurrle. Could have been straight red.

Fabricio Coloccini 9

The Argentine won his duel against Brazilian-born Costa. Skipper led by example and was outstanding. MOM.

Paul Dummett 8

Has impressed at centre half of late but switched to left back and it did not faze him. Won everything, on the floor and in the air.

Cheick Tiote 7.5

Lax in possession once or twice but made up for that with his combative nature and led the resistance late on.

Jack Colback 8

Back to the form which won him an England call-up, snapping through challenges and joining attack whenever possible. Very good.

Remy Cabella 6

Did not build on impressive cameo at Burnley and no surprise to see him substituted early in second half.

Moussa Sissoko 8

Drove his team forward at every chance and laid on second for Cisse. He is the heartbeat of this Newcastle side right now.

Sammy Ameobi 7

Recovered from shaky start to put in admirable shift down United’s left.

Ayoze Perez 8

Was a threat throughout and did brilliantly in build up to Cisse’s second.

Subs: Jak Alnwick (on 46) 7.5

Flattened Costa with his first involvement on professional debut and dealt well with string of crosses before two brilliant saves late on.

Papiss Cisse (on 53) 8.5

He scores goals, that’s what he does. Poached another pair from close range to win it for the hosts.

Chelsea

Thibaut Courtois 6

Made a crucial save from Colback at 0-0 and was let down by defence for Cisse double.

Branislav Ivanovic 6.5

Offered real danger down right and was unlucky when his crosses went without any takers.

John Terry 6

Not an easy afternoon against trickery of Perez.

Gary Cahill 5

To blame for United opener following wild clearance and had a poor game by his standards.

Chelsea Thibaut Courtois can only watch as Cisse opens the scoring at St James' Park

Cesar Azpilicueta 6

Tidy enough but did not give as much in attack as usual.

John Obi Mikel 6

Outdone by United midfield with Colback and Tiote coming out well on top in that department.

Cesc Fabregas 6

See Mikel…

Willian 6

Twice came close to opening scoring in first half but became anonymous as game wore on.

Eden Hazard stretches to reach the ball but could not prevent Chelsea's poor run of results on Tyneside

Oscar 5.5

Hard to remember anything he did of real note. Poor. 

Eden Hazard 6.5

Electric start and looked a real threat but, like all of his comrades, that soon faded.

Diego Costa 5.5

Came up against a formidable minder in Coloccini and he wasn’t afforded a kick. 

Chelsea striker Diego Costa struggled on his return to the team after a one-game suspension

Subs: Andre Schurrlle (on 61) 5.5

No impact.

Filipe Luis (on 67) 5.5

One shot from 40 yards which could have brought Blues level.

Didier Drogba (on 67) 6.5

At least gave Blues hope with header.
