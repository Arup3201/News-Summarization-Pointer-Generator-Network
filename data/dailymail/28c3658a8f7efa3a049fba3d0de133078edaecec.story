The image of Gerard Pique sat on the bench at Amsterdam, four days after the pictures of him sat in the stands at the Nou Camp, will have had more than one Premier League manager thinking: 'What a waste, what I wouldn’t give for the chance to play him in my side.'

Louis van Gaal, about whom Pique tells the story of being pushed over by as a teenage apprentice at the Nou Camp, and being told he wasn’t strong enough to be a defender by the boisterous then-Barcelona manager, will know that Pique has more experience and defensive know-how in his locker than the sum total of the Dutchman’s current Old Trafford resources.

Arsene Wenger, fresh from seeing his defence surrender a three-goal lead against Anderlecht will be similarly puzzled as to why someone who has so much of the composure and vision to turn defence into attack quickly, something he loves in a defender, is currently not good enough to play for Barcelona.

There are Premier League suitors crying out for a top defender if Pique stays on the sidelines and as we approach the winter transfer window it will only increase their appetites to sign him.

As things stand there would be two main obstacles to him returning to England. The first is his own desire to make things work at Barcelona and the second is Barca’s current transfer ban.

Pique told Sportsmail before the Clasico: 'I left a lot of friends at United and I was really happy there even though I did not play as much as I wanted to. But I always said that I want to retire here (Barcelona) and if it is possible I want to stay here all my career.'

The loyalty to the club his grandfather was a director of and who he helped lead to two European Cups under Pep Guardiola is genuine and persuading him to walk away would not be easy.

What he also said in that frank and open interview ahead of the visit to the Bernabeu was: 'At this moment I am not thinking about leaving,' adding: 'I am really happy if it is true that Manchester United want me but I want to stay.'

He always speaks warmly of United and joked about how frustrating it was to be in the shadow of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, two players who he said never seemed to get so much as a red card that would at least give him the chance to play.

He is also in contact with Cesc Fabregas who knows what it is like to feel unappreciated at the Nou Camp and forced to find a first team berth somewhere else.

In an ideal world Fabregas would still be living up the coast from Barcelona in Arenys de Mar, close to his family and would be ever-present in the Barca team but players must go where best suits their career and seeing how Fabregas has rejuvenated at Chelsea will have at least made him think.

The other major obstacle to something happening as soon as January is the transfer ban hanging over Barcelona. They cannot sign anyone until the end of the season at the earliest so why would they weaken their defensive resources by losing Pique without being able to sign replacements?

In December they will find out if the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is going to allow them to sign players at the end of the season – reducing the current ban on two transfer windows to just one. If CAS does come down in their favour then Premier League suitors might begin their enquiries.

Pique's loyalty to Barca and the club's transfer ban could stand in the way of him moving back to England

The other option open to the defender is to wait out Luis Enrique’s reign. Barcelona are in the midst of an unstable period when coaches staying for four seasons as Pep Guardiola did seem long gone. The Barcelona coach could also change his mind about Pique and bring him back in to the fold.

With his personal favourite Jeremy Mathieu injured on Wednesday night and the Barca board’s other summer signing Thomas Vermaelen still nowhere near fitness, Pique’s absence from the starting line-up seemed even more bizarre.

Most Barca fans want Javier Mascherano moved into a midfield weakened by Sergio Busquets’ drop in form and Pique back alongside Marc Bartra, but for now Enrique does not agree.

Asked after Wednesday’s game what exactly it is he is looking for from Pique: 'A change in attitude or performance?' The Barca coach hesitated over his answer, buying time by asking for the question to be repeated, and ultimately side-stepped the issue by saying he didn’t speak about individuals and just wanted the 'maximum' from everybody.

Pique may not be the player he was four years ago when Spain and Barca were in their pomp, but he remains good enough for Barcelona’s current defensive options and comfortably good enough to walk into most Premier League defences.

As it becomes increasingly difficult to understand him being left out in the cold, those who would welcome him with open arms will continue to be encouraged.
