Police began searching for five men and two women aged between 27 and 69, yesterday after they failed to return from their hike in the bush near Katoomba.

Fears were held for the group who were not equipped for an overnight stay.

Police made contact with seven missing bush walkers in the Blue Mountains this morning. The group went missing yesterday after they failed to return from a hike

This morning one of the group members managed to call a relative to inform them that they were safe.

'We have now been in touch with that group of walkers. They are all save and well, there's no injuries reported to us and they have spent the night huddled together in a cave down there in the bush,' Blue Mountains Inspector Ken Shack-Evans told ABC radio on Monday morning.

The exact location of the group is unknown, but the group have been told to stay put and it is hoped they will be out of the bush by midday.

Police said the group were quite experienced bush walkers, but they were not prepared for an overnight stay, particularly in the Blue Mountains where temperatures dropped to seven degrees overnight.

'They certainly weren't dressed for overnight activities. Between the seven of them they only had two torches,' Insp Shack Evans told ABC Radio.

The hikers spent the night huddled in a cave and were able to call a relative this morning to let them know they were safeÂ
