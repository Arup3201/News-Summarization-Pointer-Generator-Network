Usually if you want to lose weight, the first thing that has to stop is all those trips to the local takeaway.

But now a former junk food addict hopes to show dieters they can lose weight and still enjoy a night in with an Indian, or a Chinese.

Danielle Moss, 35 from Salford, Greater Manchester is leading the way in helping others keep their waistlines in check after opening a 'healthy' fast food restaurant.

She has a petite frame of 5ft 3" but weighed more than ten stone and wanted to shift the extra pounds without giving up her favourite fast food.

So she created her very own low calorie takeaway-style kebab and burger recipes to help her lose more than a stone and a half in weight.

Danielle, pictured on holiday in Cyprus in 2010, weighed ten stone at 5ft 3". She now weighs just 8.5 stone

Mother-of-two Danielle was so happy with her results she decided she just had to share them - and not just with her family.

The healthy chef took her meals out of her own kitchen and launched a brand of lean Indian, Chinese and Italian cuisine with less than half the calories at her Naji's Kitchen eaterie in her home town.

'Everything we sell is what you would expect in a takeaway except that for example our chips are oven baked and our chicken burgers are coated in crushed cornflakes and honey,' said Danielle who now weighs 8.5 stone.

'Nothing is ground breaking it's just looking at a delicious and easy way to cook something.

'It's strange because I thought the kind of people that would come in would be women who are conscious of their weight and the food they eat but we have had a lot of young lads who go to the gym a lot.'

Ex-marketing assistant Danielle had piled on the pounds three years ago after she and husband Colin would order out up to three times each week.

Eventually she researched her intake of food and created her own takeaway-styled menus and substitute fatty ingredients such as oil and butter.

Danielle said: 'I started Weight Watchers and was able to look at the plans to see what we should be eating and I realised that mine and my husband's portions were huge.

'I realised that the food I was cooking that I thought was healthy really wasn't. We were having a 500g pack of mince between us in a lasagne which has so much fat.

'I spent loads of time cooking and looking at the things we were putting into our bodies.

'I made a great low fat curry one night and while talking to my husband discussed why takeaway food couldn't be delicious and healthy.

'When I was on weight watchers I lost around a stone but I have found that becoming a bit more educated on food and cooking more has improved our lifestyles massively. I love running and we have much more energy.'

Danielle got the idea when she was trying to lose some weight but was missing takeaways

Danielle's chilli meatball kebabs are made with lean mince blended with onions, spices and oil substitute fry-lite at only 249 calories compared with one in an average takeaway expected to rack up more than 1,000.

Her pizzas are made using wholemeal flour and reduced fat toppings at around 600 calories compared to one you may find in your local takeaway at 2,000 calories.

All of their sauces are homemade using only natural and fat free ingredients with chilli sauce at only 100 calories compared to 200 calories and chutney at a mere 13 calories against 150 calories in a takeaway.

All of the meals on the menu come with a calorie counter and even using one extra ingredient could alter the fat content.

She said: 'What we didn't want is for it to scream healthy which would put people off we want people to think that it is a takeaway with things like curries and kebabs rather than salads and cous cous.

'We want to be known as a takeaway that is healthy, but not where people are saying: â€˜oh I don't want that lettuce leaf diet rubbish.'

'We originally had to really train our cooks as it can be really tempting to put an extra bit of chicken or extra cheese as we are advertising that dish with the nutritional values in and we do not want to sell something that we are not advertising.

'But the chefs know the recipes in and out and know exactly what must go into each dish, you haven't got the freedom in many kitchens where you can add or take away ingredients as you choose.'
