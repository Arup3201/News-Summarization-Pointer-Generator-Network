A 24-year-old South Carolina woman was left to die in a wooded area by an acquaintance — but miraculously survived for four days while drinking pond water, her family says.

Kimara Hughey, of Greenville, was stuck off a ravine at the Swamp Rabbit Trail on October 14 and was only found four days later.

Joggers heard a woman calling for help Saturday and called a rescue crew in.

'She was placed in these woods and she was left there to die,' father Larry Gaunt told FOX Carolina.

'She's laying there all five days, looking up at the sky, crawling around, in the mud, drinking pond water.'

Parents Wendy and Larry Gaunt say their daughter knew who left her in the woods to die

The parents say she was found in horrific conditions. She was covered in bruises and hypothermia had already set in, they say.

Hughey's worried family were posting flyers in the woods Saturday when police called with the news of their daughters' reappearance. 

'Just knowing that she was alive and going to be okay was such a relief,' Wendy Gaunt told FOX Carolina.'

Hughey's parents wouldn't disclose details of the 24-year-old's disappearance while police continue to investigate who was behind it.

The parents said only that Hughey knew the person who left her there to die.

Hughey remains fearful and traumatized but is expected to recover.

'She's very, very fragile right now, mentally and physically — and she is so scared,' the parents told FOX Carolina.

Hughey's parents posted several posters around the Swamp Rabbit Trail, including this one on mile 31, near the spot where she was found by joggers
