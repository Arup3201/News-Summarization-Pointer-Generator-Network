The Russian secret services are deploying an innovative new weapon in the age of cyber-spying - the almost forgotten typewriter.

Kremlin counter-intelligence officers reckon this is the only way to prevent their most classified information being stolen by the kind of computer-based data theft exposed by renegade U.S. agent Edward Snowden.

An order for 20 typewriters has been made by the elite Federal Guard Service, known by the acronym FSO, which is in charge of protecting Russian president Vladimir Putin, his prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, and other senior officials, it was disclosed on Thursday.

Untraceable: Using typewriters, the Kremlin hopes to put an end to confidential documents being leaked and its staff being spied on

'After scandals with the distribution of secret documents by WikiLeaks, the exposes by Edward Snowden, reports about Dmitry Medvedev being listened in on during his visit to the G20 summit in London, it has been decided to expand the practice of creating paper documents,' said a source.

Snowden's presence with his laptops - said to be bulging with U.S. secrets - in the transit lounge at Moscow's Sheremetyevo, brings the threat of cyber-spying home to Russia, explained pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia.

Unlike printers, every typewriter has its own individual pattern of type so it is possible to link every document to a machine used to type it, said the newspaper.

Typewriters rather than computers are already deployed, described as 'normal practice to ensure security', to record Putin's deepest secrets, said another source.

The decision to revert to typewriters among Russia's elite guards follows revelations that U.S. spies intercepted top-secret communications of the then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, right, during his visit to London for the G20 summit. he is pictured with U.S. President Obama, left, during a bilateral meeting at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, South Korea, in March

'Typewriters are still used in Russia's power structures, like the Defence Ministry, the Emergencies Ministry, and the security services,' said news agency RIA Novosti.

'They are used predominantly for top secret messages addressed to the president or the defence minister.'

An order for the 20 new typewriters and 600 ink cartridges costing 486,500 (Â£9,880) by the FSO is shown - ironically - on a government website.

Putin has insisted that his secret services have not taken advantage of Snowden's almost three weeks in Russia to grab his cache of intelligence.
