The heart wrenching reunion of a mother with her baby just three months after she cut her child’s throat in a moment of snap psychosis has been captured on video.

The profound moment captured in a Southland psychiatric hospital where the mother was being treated in December will air on tonight’s episode of New Zealand’s 3rd Degree TV program.

The footage shows the mother cradling her four-month-old daughter for the first time since she used a vegetable knife to cut her throat in September last year.

A mother is reunited with her baby  after cutting her throat in September last year. She was found not guilty of attempted murder after being diagnosed with postpartum psychosis

After treatment for the 'land mine' psychosis, which caused the distressing attack, the mother was given permission to return to her family home under the condition she is never alone with the child, The New Zealand Herald reported. The event was labelled as a 'land mine' because it could not have been foreseen.

The mother is overjoyed about being reunited with her child and will never forgive herself for the psychotic snap despite having absolutely no recollection of the horrifying incident

The father, David, told 3rd Degree his concerns for his wife began the night before the incident when she passed out at their home.

The mother spent the Saturday night at Southland Hospital on a drip and was diagnosed with post-natal depression. She was discharged the following morning and advised to visit her GP on the Monday.

But this advice would prove far too late. The couple woke at 5am the next day after a restless night and the mother took the baby to the living room to feed. David walked in to find his wife attempting to take their three-week-old baby's life - as well as her own.

'She was hearing things and seeing things that didn't exist and was saving the baby by killing it,' he said. 'The baby's throat was cut and [she] was cutting her [own] wrists.'

The family is back together again but only under the condition that the mother not be alone with her daughter who is now ten-months-old

Evidence to the court later revealed the mother had suffered abuse as a child at the hands of an older relative who then became a prominent figure in her hallucination.

Their daughter was flown to Starship hospital in Auckland for life-saving surgery. Her trachea was severed, an artery cut and a nerve on one side of the voice box also cut. The mother was kept at Southland Hospital's mental health unit.

The woman's husband had to break the shocking news to her slowly

David had to break the news in parts to his wife, who had no recollection of the horrifying event, starting with a picture of the tube in their daughter's throat and then explaining how it got there.

‘She will never forgive herself,’ he said.

David spoke of the difficulties with Child Youth and Family over custody, claiming the agency told him he would have to choose between living with his wife or daughter.

Post-natal psychosis is a rare condition with only one or two in 1,000 who suffer from it

‘It's a choice no one in this world should have to make,’ he said.

The staff were cleared in an inquiry into Southern District Health Board's handling of the case because said it was deemed an unforeseeable 'landmine.'

Before finding the mother not guilty of attempted murder in late March, Justice Graham Panckhurst told her ‘your baby was cherished and well-loved’.

Women who suffer from bipolar are believed to be more susceptible to the condition

He imposed a court order requiring her to undergo community-based mental health care.

Court reports from psychiatrists were conflicted other whether she knew the severity of her attack.

Otago University associate professor Phillip Brinded, a forensic psychiatrist, told the court in a February report ‘her psychotic mental state would ... have rendered her unable of knowing that the act was morally wrong’.
