A father has won his fight for a review into a decision by prosecutors not to charge doctors who allegedly failed to spot his son was dying 25 years ago. 

Robbie Powell, ten, of Ystradgynlais, Powys, was seen by five different doctors from December 1989 before he died from the rare Addison’s disease in April 1990.

His father William, 56, has fought for justice after police found the doctors could face up to 35 charges including manslaughter and forging medical documents.

The Crown Prosecution Service refused to prosecute the doctors because the case was so old, but Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders has now ordered a review into the decision.

Mr Powell said: ‘If the doctors had admitted their mistakes at the time we would have been able to move on.

‘This has taken over my life and it has taken a toll on my other children and on my marriage to my wife. I won’t feel this is over until we have some justice for Robbie.’

Robbie died 24 years ago  of the rare illness which stops the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys producing vital hormones. More than 8,000 people in Britain have the disease - most commonly found in those aged from 30 to 50.

Six years later the NHS accepted there was negligence during Robbie’s treatment at Morriston Hospital in Swansea.

Mr Powell said: ‘The CPS said in 2003 that they weren’t willing to go ahead with prosecutions because of how much time had gone by.

‘But the Director of Public Prosecutions has said that whether it’s 30 days or 30 years, if there’s enough evidence the perpetrators will be prosecuted. It has given me hope.’

The Crown Prosecution Service said they will start the review procedure by taking a new statement from Mr Powell.

A spokesman said: ‘The DPP has written to Mr Powell to confirm we will relook at the material in the case relating to the death of his son. 

'The first step will be to ask the police to take a statement from Mr Powell.’
