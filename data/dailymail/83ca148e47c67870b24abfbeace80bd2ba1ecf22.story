The Sportsman, which calls itself a ‘grotty rundown pub by the sea’ on its Twitter page is helmed by  self-taught head-chef Stephen and his brother Phil Harris.  

The pub, which has had its Michelin star since 2008, prides itself on a menu of locally-sourced ingredients.

Fish and seafood is sourced from the Thames estuary whilst meat and poultry come from nearby farms. The Harris brothers also grow some of their ingredients themselves in the small kitchen garden and polytunnel.

Dishes on the ala carte menu include slip sole in seaweed butter; thornback ray, brown butter and razor clams in a sherry vinegar dressing and roast gurnard fillet with bouillabaisse sauce and green olive tapenade. 

'We are all thrilled to have won the award. A lot of hard work is iinvolved and it's always so lovely to have it recognised. 

Although the food gets a lot of credit,what's really good is the whole experience - the food, the service and a nice day out by the sea,' Stephen Harris told FEMAIL.
