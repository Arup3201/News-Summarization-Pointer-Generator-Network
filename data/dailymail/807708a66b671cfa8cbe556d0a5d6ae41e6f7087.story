An Australian father who had been fighting cancer for the last five years has passed away in the arms of his wife.

Rome Torti, from Queensland's Gold Coast, had been battling an aggressive form of brain cancer on-and-off since 2009 - the same length of time he's been married and the entirety of his son's life.

On Friday it was revealed that the 32-year-old had lost his battle with the disease. He is survived by his wife Rachel and son Rider.

After a five year battle with an aggressive form of cancer, Gold Coast skate photographer Rome Torti has passed away

A touching tribute posted on the Support Rome Torti Facebook page said he passed away peacefully in his home.

'Rome Torti passed away this morning, with his wife Rachel’s arms wrapped around him and the rain coming down,' the post began.

'He was peaceful, he was at home and he knew he was loved.

'For all of us who loved Rome, it may not have been forever, but it was our forever.

'For Rachel, Rome and Ryder, it may not have been a perfect love story, but it was their love story.

'Thank you all for sharing in Rome’s wonderful, fun, happy, enormous life', the tribute read in part.

The touching post also spoke of Rome's positive attitude and resilience throughout the ordeal.

'Rome attracted friends and supporters for a reason – his positivity and strength was inspirational and a force that all of us simply wanted to be around. He was a happy warrior who lived what he loved.

'His family and friends thank you so much for all for your unending support.'

The tribute closed with the promise that details of a 'Celebration of Rome' would come soon, and suggested Rome would be skateboarding 'somewhere up there' with his close mate Shane Cross, a fellow skater who died in a motorbike accident in 2007.

Messages flowed in from friends, family and supporters for the father-of-one, expressing their heartbreak at hearing the news.

One person wrote: 'Words can't summarise what I'm feeling right now. All the inspiration you brought to so many will never be forgotten Rome. You are a beautiful soul. You will be missed brother. Roll on'.

Another said: 'RIP Rome.. Even though I've never met you in person, I have followed your journey and progress for some time..Your strength and determination has forever inspired me and my family (my husband and father both have cancer)..Thoughts and prayers go out to Rachel and the Torti family'.

Earlier this year Rome made the heartbreaking decision to give up his battle to spend whatever time he has left with his young family and said moving forward he was going to embrace each day he has left with wife Rachel and son Ryder.

The tribute spoke of his positive attitude and strength throughout the ordeal

The photographer had been battling cancer for the same amount of time he was married to wife Rachel and the entirety of his son Ryder' life

'Rome has been battling his guts out for the past five and a half years... He has constantly been juggling medicine, treatments, supplements, therapies and operations,' a post on his supporter Facebook page said.

'Rome recently had a big fight for his health and came through with miraculous results. At the end of that battle, he also made a big decision. That decision was to switch from fight to peace.'

Mr Torti underwent major surgery two days before Christmas last year so renowned surgeon Dr Charlie Teo could remove the Giloblatoma Multiforme Grade 4 malignant brain tumour and buy the young father some time.

But the tumour, which had begun to wrap around Mr Torti's brain stem, was one of the worst Dr Teo had seen and the operation left him with paralysis.

Mr Torti, a well known skate photographer on the Gold Coast, had already tried chemotherapy, radiation, natural therapies, supplements, oxygen therapy and even an expensive experimental German treatment called oncothermia, which he planned to try once more this year in Germany.

'He and his family have spent all their free time and energy fighting against a tumour that was supposed to take him years ago,' the Facebook page post said.

Rome and Rachel had sold their house and car and cashed in their savings and superannuation to help fund the rehabilitation, treatment and medical bills over the past five years

'He has won that fight because he has had days, weeks, months and years with his precious family. Memories that will never disappear.

'Today and each day forward, Rome is embracing being with his family, under the case of the amazing palliative nursing team - waking up to cuddles from Ryder, listening to his wife Rachel laugh, getting huge hugs from his friends and family.'

The couple had sold their house and car and cashed in their savings and superannuation to help fund the rehabilitation, treatment and medical bills over the past five years.

An online fundraising campaign received more than $100,000 in donations, with dozens of celebrities including World Champion surfers Mick Fanning and Joel Parkinson also making contributions.
