Denmark has dropped out of the contest to host the 2022 Ryder Cup, leaving six European nations in the running.

Austria, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Turkey have announced their intention to submit a formal bid, with Turkey performing a U-turn after indicating they would wait until 2026 in order to construct a purpose-built venue.

Ryder Cup director Richard Hills, said: 'The Ryder Cup bidding process has a number of important milestones and we very much look forward to working with the six bidding nations, their representatives and their national golf federations in developing the specifics of their respective 2022 bids.

'The key criteria we have in place ensure we evaluate each bid equally on both its sporting and commercial merits, while allowing us to judge each bid fairly and thoroughly.'

The six bidding nations will host a series of meetings and inspection visits by Ryder Cup Europe officials between now and April 30, 2015, the date by which formal submission of official bids needs to be made.

The host country and venue is due to be named in autumn 2015.
