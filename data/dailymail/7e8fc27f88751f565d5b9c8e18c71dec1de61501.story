Twin girls born joined at the head have been successfully separated by British doctors.

Rital and Ritag Gaboura, who are 11 months old, survived at odds of one in 10million.

They had four complex operations at London’s Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital.

The sisters, who were born in 
Khartoum, Sudan, were brought to Britain for the procedures by their 
parents Abdelmajeed Gaboura, 31, and, Enas, 27, who are both doctors.

By the time they arrived, Ritag’s heart was already failing.

The girls were separated over four 
stages. Two initial operations took place in May, before tissue 
expanders were inserted in July and the final separation was attempted 
on August 15.

The parents had approached children’s
charity Facing the World for help, and the organisation funded and 
arranged their separation.

The girls suffered from the rare condition of craniopagus, and the surgery was carried out by a team led by David Dunaway.

A statement from Facing the World said: ‘Within days the twins were back on the general ward interacting and playing as before.

‘Their laughter and delight in the world has been an inspiration throughout the months of worry.

‘Very soon, their parents will be able to fulfil their dream of taking home two healthy, separate daughters.’

The girls’ parents said: ‘We are very thankful to be able to look forward to going home with two separate, healthy girls.

'We are very grateful to all the  
doctors who volunteered their time and to Facing the World for 
organising all the logistics and for paying for the surgery.

‘We feel very lucky that our girls 
have been able to have the  surgery that they needed, but we also know 
of other children who need complete sponsorship and families who are 
searching for someone to help them.’

Conjoined twins are extremely rare, 
occurring in only one in every 100,000 live births. They are three times
more likely to be girls.

In nearly three-quarters of cases, the twins are connected mid-torso.
Just 4 per cent of cases involve fused skulls, and most are stillborn or do not survive longer than 24 hours.

Rital and Ritag were born with one of
the most serious forms of the condition as they shared blood vessels 
and there was significant blood flow between their brains.

Ritag supplied half her sister’s 
brain with blood and drained most of it back to her own body to 
re-oxygenate – meaning her heart was doing most of the work for both of 
them.

Any significant drop in blood pressure during surgery could have caused brain damage.

While both girls are as alert as they
were before the operation, it could be years before their parents and 
doctors discover if they have suffered any long-term problems.
