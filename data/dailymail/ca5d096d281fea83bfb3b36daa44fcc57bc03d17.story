'We share the community’s concern about this content and promptly removed it after being made aware of it by local safety advocates and education contacts,' a spokesperson for Facebook told The Advertiser. 

One video, which showed a larger student attacking a smaller student at Craigmore High School, had more than 60,000 views after being posted on March 27.

Craigmore principal Des Wauchope confirmed the incident occurred on school grounds on February 19. He called the attack shocking and said it was uncommon at the school.

South Australian police (SAPOL) have condemned the attacks said investigators were working with the state education department to find the people involved.

'Once (the Education Department) has identified the schools, students and victims involved, SAPOL and the department will work together to follow up any allegations of criminal assault,' a police spokesperson told The Advertiser.

The page was created on March 26 and has garnered over 10,000 likes in five days

The page contains at least eight videos of attacks.

Cyber bullying expert Barbara Spears from the University of South Australia said the page was worrying.

'What we’re seeing here is a fight club approach which is not something any school would condone,' Dr Spears told Seven News.

'Certainly some of the images I’ve seen, there is assault happening. I would advocate that it be closed down because it is not doing anyone a service.'

Education Department director Susan Cameron said there was a zero tolerance approach to violence.

'I’m disturbed and am quite confident my colleagues in schools will be taking swift action to work with the perpetrators and support the victims,' Ms Cameron said.

'You should be ashamed for promoting this kind of thing and Facebook should be disgusted for not having shut this down. You're filth, plain and simple,' posted on social media user on the page.

The administrator hit back at criticism on the page and created a 'back up' page in case it was taken down

'This page is disgusting and should be shut down. Do you have permission from everyone who appears in these videos to post? If not you are violating privacy laws,' posted another Facebook user.

'I hope those responsible are caught and charged soon. Promoting this behaviour amongst our children is sad and wrong. Hope SAPOL have a chance to trace you all before too long.'

The administrator of the page defended his creation and has created a 'back up' page called 'Aussie Box Ons' in case the page is taken down by Facebook.

'Sooks! If you don't like the page don't like it or follow our posts,' the administrator posted.
