Two Mexican police officers have found themselves on the wrong side of the law after they were arrested this week for looting from the site of music superstar Jenni Rivera's fatal plane crash.

The officers were caught after images of the crash site were found on one of the arrested officers' cell phones - the same images leaked to the Mexican media this week, according to the Nuevo Leon state government.

The extremely graphic photos depicted body parts and personal documents belonging to those aboard the doomed flight, including Rivera, 43, a singer and reality star known as the 'Queen of Banda.'

Corrupt cops? Two police officers guarding the site where Jenni Rivera's plane crashed on Sunday have been accused of stealing personal items belonging to those aboard the doomed flight

Large personality: Rivera, 43, seen here in Los Angeles in March, was very popular among Latin music fans

Loved ones: Rivera's family gathered outside of her parents' home near Long Beach, California, on Wednesday night for a press conference

The Spanish news agency EFE identified the arrested officers as Luis Antonio Ávila Moreno, 23 and Mario Alberto García Pacheco, 24.

The items that the duo allegedly stole from the plane were not identified by investigators.

As the issue of police corruption rears its ugly head, Mexican authorities hope to continue with the investigation of the tragic crash on Sunday.

A person speaking on behalf of the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles told TMZ: 'We have over 2,000,000 police officers [in Mexico], and unfortunately some of these officers have been corrupt in the past, but we cannot generalize that the whole force is corrupt.'

The rep added: Mexico has been working very hard to make their citizens and tourists safe, however it is not fair to judge the whole tree based upon a few bad apples.'

Scatttered: One of the officers was additionally accused of taking graphic photos of the crash site, including body parts, and leaking them to the media

The body of the singer and reality star from California was found in the wreckage along with the bodies of six others, including her publicist, lawyer, make-up artist and two pilots.

News of the arrests came as Rivera's family identified her remains.

Nuevo Leon state security spokesman Jorge Domene said DNA tests are still pending. The singer's remains will be given to the family once the tests are completed in coming days.

It was also revealed this week that Rivera was in the final states of buying the Learjet plane from business executive Christian E. Esquino Nunez.

Nunez is wanted for questioning regarding his ties to the plane, and has been convicted of drug-trafficking and counterfeiting government inspection stamps in the past.

Disastrous: Rivera's body was found in the wreckage along with the bodies of six others, including her publicist, lawyer, make-up artist and two pilots

Search continues: Rescue workers are still looking for remains of Rivera and the six reported passengers

ABC News exclusively reported that 
Nunez could be wanted for questioning with Mexican authorities, as well 
as investigators with the National Transportation and Safety Board 
(NTSB) regarding the fatal crash.

The Learjet 25 belongs to Starwood Management, which is, according to records, owned by Nunez.

According to ABC News, Nunez and his 
partnerwere convicted of creating false logbooks for 
six aircrafts they bought from the Mexican government and sold in the 
U.S.

RadarOnline.com reports that Nunez 
also has ties to a Tijuana drug cartel, and has also been accused of 
trying to sneak the son of late Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi into 
Mexico.

Wanted? Christian E. Esquino Nunez, who runs the company that owned the crashed plane, could have links to a drug cartel and was convicted of falsifying records in 2006

Court records show that Nunez 
obtained details from aircrafts and forged details so as to mark up 
aircraft prices, thinking the models had fewer miles on them or had more
maintenance work than they actually had.

Nunez’s current whereabouts are unknown.

The plane carrying the superstar 
plunged from more than 28,000 feet and hit the ground in a nose-dive at 
more than 600 miles an hour, Mexico's top transportation official says.

Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, Mexico's 
secretary of communications and transportation, said: 'The plane practically nose-dived,' he said. 'The impact must have been terrible.'

Ruiz Esparza did not offer any explanation of what may have caused the plane to plummet, saying only that 'The plane fell from an altitude of 28,000 feet ... It may have hit a speed higher than 1,000 kph (621 mph).'

Widespread: Searchers used helicopters as they looked for pieces of the wreckage and attempted to recover bodies from the mountainous area where the plane went down

Discovery: It appears that one of the pilots was inexperienced, based on the temporary airman's certificate found at the crash site
