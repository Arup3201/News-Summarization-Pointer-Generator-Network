Luis Suarez looked poorly while warming up for Liverpool's clash with Crystal Palace, and was left sick as a parrot afterwards the demoralising draw.

The PFA Player of the Year arrived at Selhurst Park with his usual stash of traditional Uruguayan tea mate and ended the evening in floods of tears after the Reds somehow let a three-goal lead slip.

That effectively ended any lingering hopes of getting their hands on the Premier League title next weekend.
