Released: Police have not said when or where they found Ms Parker's phone but did release a photo of Ms Parker that was stored on the phone as well as one of the iPhone itself

An iPhone belonging to missing Florida woman Michelle Parker has been found by police officers investigating her disappearance.

The 33-year-old's sister has confirmed the phone belongs to Ms Parker, but officers have not revealed when or where the device was found.

They have released two new photos, however: one of Ms Parker taken from her iPhone and one of the phone itself, covered in its black and pink Hurley case.

This is the latest break in the case that has now entered its third week.

The
search for the mother-of-two, who was last seen on November 17, 
expanded with authorities looking for evidence at Lake Ellenor, in 
Orlando, Florida, where the signal from her phone was last traced.

The
expansion comes after a judge ruled that the three-year-old twins faced
no imminent danger in the care of their father and Ms Parker's her 
former partner Dale Smith, 40, who is the police's prime suspect in the 
case.

The twins were taken out of Mr Smith's care last week because of police suspicions, but has had no charged filed against him.

Ms
Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, wiped away tears after the hearing and
said that they would work with Mr Smith and his attorneys to figure out
a plan in which she could visit the children. She briefly hugged Smith 
after the hearing.

'I hugged Dale to tell him that my grandbabies - I want to be able to see them,' Mrs Stewart said.

'And I hope we can work something out because they're so important to me and my family. He said he would work it out with us.'

Ms Parker's sister echoed her mother's
sentiments, saying that the family has not told her sister's children 
that she is missing and instead hopes that a better outcome will happen 
before they need to.

'When I first heard that she was missing, of course my mind went to Dale,' said sister Lauren Erickson says.

'I
know their history, and they have had a lot of issues. But I really do 
hope and pray that he had nothing to do with it. He could be totally 
innocent; I hope he is. But if he knows something, he needs to tell 
everything that he knows,' Ms Erickson continued.

Ms
Parker disappeared on November 17, the same day an episode of 'The 
People's Court' aired in which she and Mr Smith argued over who was 
responsible for the cost of a missing $5,000 engagement ring.

Joe Iuzzolino, an attorney for the 
Florida Department of Children and Families, told Judge Turner today 
that Mr Smith had displayed abusive and criminal behavior on multiple 
occasions since 1992 that included him striking Ms Parker in front of 
the children in 2009

But 
with no evidence that Smith had abused the children, the judge wasn't 
persuaded that they should be removed from his care. The children have 
been living with Mr Smith and his parents since the 33-year-old Parker 
disappeared.

The judge said: 'I don't think incidents that happened years ago constitute a pattern.'

As to Ms Parker's disappearance, the 
judge said: 'I can speculate like everyone else what's happened to Miss 
Parker. But there's no evidence.'

Mr Smith's attorney, Mark NeJame, has said his client has done nothing wrong and he has not been charged.

'We've
maintained throughout that this has been overstated and overblown by 
the police department and there's been a rush to indict,' he said.

Mr Smith and Ms Parker had been together off and on since 2006 before appearing on the television show.

Ms Parker said they got into a heated argument in a hotel that included her throwing the engagement ring at him. It fell nine stories into the hotel atrium, and they couldn't find it. The television judge said they needed to split the cost of the ring.

Court records show Ms Parker filed for
a domestic violence injunction against Mr Smith in 2009 but the order 
was dismissed after a hearing.

Mr
Smith has had traffic infractions and arrests on a misdemeanor drug 
charge and a misdemeanor charge of possession of an opened container of 
alcohol in a car, according to court records. The most serious charge he
faced was for aggravated battery in 1996. He pleaded guilty and a 
prison sentence was withheld.

Orlando Police Chief Paul Rooney revealed that Smith had 'simply refused' to take a polygraph test when it was offered to him.

Stormy: The couple went on the show to settle a dispute over an engagement ring

During a press conference, Ms Parker's mother made an emotional plea to her daughter's former partner.

Ms
Stewart said: 'You could have avoided this Dale, if you had cooperated 
with the police and took a polygraph test when they asked you, you could
have avoided a lot of stress.

'So unfortunately, you brought this on yourself. We're not going to stop until we find out who did this.'

Mrs
Stewart added: 'Dale, honestly, if you're out there, honey, and you're 
listening to me, I have always said from day one - it's okay if couples 
fight.

'If you made a 
mistake, it was just a second of "oh, I lost my head," or whatever and 
you didn't know what to do... our family needs to have Michelle home. We
need to heal.'

Happier times: Parker had previously applied for a restraining order against her partner, but it was denied

Meanwhile photos of Mr Smith taking part in a racy Hottest Men of 2007 competition have emerged, not helping to paint him in a good light. He is seen stripping to his boxers in the competition in his home city, Orlando, Florida.

Photographs of Smith in the competition show him stripping down to his underwear as he dances to music and waves a cowboy hat on stage.

The racy moves are for an annual competition held by Orlando radio station XL1067.
