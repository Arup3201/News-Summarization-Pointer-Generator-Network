Killed: Trang-Thuy Nguyen, 37, died in hospital Tuesday after being hit by a falling wooden plank

A 37-year-old woman was killed in Manhattan's West Village by a piece of plywood that was blown out of luxury condo development in high winds.

The woman has been named as Trang-Thuy Nguyen - she was taken to a nearby hospital but died after the wood struck her body.

She was pushed into a wall at a parking garage and struck her head, a source told the New York Daily News.

The incident occurred on West 12th Street at 5:50 p.m on Tuesday.

The plywood came from new construction The Greenwich Lane - a 200-unit development in five buildings and five townhouses that stands on what was once the site of St. Vincent's Hospital.

ABC 7 reports the woman was on her cell phone as she passed the entrance to a parking lot entrance, when the 4-by-8 sheet of plywood, separated from the security fence across the street.

The Greenwich Lane, which is LEED certified, has apartments starting at $3.65 million.

It is nearly completely sold out and already have some interest from designer Michael Kors who is reported to be purchasing a penthouse at the development.

Part of the property is now home to the most expensive apartment ever sold in Greenwich Village.

According to NY Curbed: 'The south penthouse at 155 West 11th Street, the new construction tower that's part of the Greenwich Lane complex, entered contract for $45 million, a price that will set a new neighborhood price record when it closes.'
