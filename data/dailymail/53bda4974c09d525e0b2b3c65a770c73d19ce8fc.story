You know you have to do something about your waistline when it gets so big that you can't even weight yourself anymore.  

An obese dad has revealed how he shed seven stone in a year after his weight soared past the limit on his scales.

At his heaviest, Daniel Boulton, 33, from Swadlincote, Derby, weighed 19 stone and the needle on the scales would rocket past their maximum limit.

Father of one Daniel Boulton from Derby lost an incredible seven stone after being shocked to find he could no longer weigh himself on his scales 

The manufacturing manager's attitude towards alcohol and junk food saw his weight skyrocket. 

 As well as regular boozy nights out, Daniel relied on processed dinners for his evening meals and would also stuff his face with slice after slice of white bread while waiting for the food to cook.  

But, after his beautiful daughter Scarlett was born in 2013, he decided to change his diet and eating habits.

In just over a year, Daniel shed a gigantic seven stone - over a third of his body weight - and is preparing to run this year's London Marathon.

Daniel said that he wanted to lose weight because he didn't want to be the 'fat dad' for his baby daughter Scarlett

A newly-svelte Daniel said: 'When the needle on my scales travelled past it's limit, that was the final straw. 

'They topped out at 19 stone and I just couldn't believe I was that fat.

Daniel piled on the pounds thanks to a diet of alcohol and unhealthy ready meals

'I was in complete denial. Looking back at pictures, my clothes didn't fit properly, I was bloated and puffy.'

As Daniel worked in a food processing plant, he was surrounded by lovely-smelling but unhealthy ready meals.

This led him to constantly crave them, so, despite being brought up on healthy home-cooked meals, coming home at night he would just throw one into the oven.

To make matters worse, he would fill the cooking time by eating slices of bread and butter.

Daniel said: 'I'd immediately grab a couple just to tide me over. After that, I'd just grab a couple more and then a couple more.

'Then I'd pile my plate high with a massive dinner and scoff that down too. Looking back, I really wasn't kind to my body. I smoked, drank too much and never did any exercise.

'I was constantly tired and exposed my back and knee joints to a lot of pressure from either standing on my feet or driving all day.'

Daniel managed to lose five stone from monitoring his calorie and fat intake but as his weight loss stalled, he began to fall back into his own ways and regained all of the weight again.

It wasn't until he and his wife Emily welcomed their baby girl Scarlett into the world that Daniel redoubled his efforts to shed the pounds.

He said: 'I knew that I had to be there for her in the years to come. I wanted to be able to play and run around with her when the time came.

'I wanted to be able to run up the stairs, without feeling like I had sprinted a 10-second 100 metres, or walk up the hill without losing my breath.

'Diabetes was always in the back of my mind and, quite simply, I didn't want to be her fat dad!'

Daniel signed up for the Harcombe Diet for Men after hearing about it on the radio.

Daniel is now a keen runner and is planning to run the London Marathon this year 

The focus of the three-phase plan is to eat 'real' foods, focusing on meat, fish and vegetables and cutting out fruit and sweet foods in the first phase.

These are gradually re-introduced as the diet continues, but no calorie or fat counting is necessary.

Daniel said: 'As soon as I heard that I didn't need to just eat fruit, I was in. I followed the book and pre-planned everything, so we could budget for only those things that we needed.

'I stayed on Phase 1 for approximately five months and was losing a stone a month. It just fell off. Emily supported me all the way and would eat everything I ate.

'We ate the same things on the same day for the entire period on Phase 1. I don't think I could have done it without that involvement and support from her.

'It might sound extreme, but now I have so much more confidence in my body image.'

Now just over a year after starting the Harcombe diet, Daniel has shed seven stone and regularly runs up to 18km a week in preparation for the London Marathon.

Daniel followed the 'workable' Harcombe diet which meant eating a balanced diet 

Daniel said: 'I've had a lifelong ambition to run the London Marathon and last year I finally took up running.

'I have never really been a sporty person, but I took to running like a duck to water. Coupled with my better diet, this has helped me keep the weight off.

'I can buy clothes that fit properly and I'm so much more alert to play with Scarlett. I know it's a cliché but I feel like a new man.'

Zoë Harcombe, the diet's founder, has researched the characteristics of a 'workable' diet, obesity, eating disorders and food cravings for 20 years.

She said: 'Daniel's journey has been fantastic and our other members say his story is a real beacon for them.

'Like all our club members, Daniel has ditched fake foods and just eats real food.

'He hasn't counted a single calorie, point, carb, or starved himself for one or two days a week.

'Daniel's results have been fantastic, and I'll certainly be cheering him on when he finally runs the London Marathon.'
