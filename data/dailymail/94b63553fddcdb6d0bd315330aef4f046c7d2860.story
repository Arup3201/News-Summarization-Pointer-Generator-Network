The Ecuadorean government is battling to keep WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange safe from extradition to America, and fears that the U.S. Government has hatched secret plans to thwart them.

Ecuador has become Mr Assange's unlikely defender, providing him with diplomatic protection at their embassy in Knightsbridge, London, for the past five weeks.

Mr Assange sought refuge in the embassy after he failed in his bid to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning about alleged sex offences.

Avoiding extradition: Some believe the US government have secret plans to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to face a possible conspiracy to commit espionage which holds a sentence of life in prison

An Ecuadorean political adviser labelled the suspected U.S. secret plans as 'evil'.

He was quoted in a report in The Guardian as saying: ‘In 
legal terms…the evil that Ecuador wishes to prevent is the extradition [of Mr Assange] to the US.

‘Now if there are ways and means of that being tied down, I think that would be a just solution.’

Ecuadorean diplomats have been 
seeking guarantees from the UK and Sweden that Mr Assange would not be 
extradited to the U.S. but is yet to hear a formal response from either 
country.

Mr Assange's lawyers believe there are secret plans to send him from Sweden to America to face trial, possibly for conspiracy to commit espionage, a charge which could see him face life imprisonment.

The WikiLeaks website published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables that embarrassed several governments and international businesses.

A Foreign Office spokesman said that the UK had a binding legal obligation to extradite Assange to Sweden for questioning.

He said: ‘The UK courts, including the supreme court, have confirmed that Mr Assange’s extradition to Sweden complies with all the requirements of the UK’s Extradition Act, including as regards the protection of his human rights.’

Seeking sanctuary: Assange has been living at the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge, London and would be immediately arrested if he steps outside

Mr Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden over accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in August 2010 while on a visit to give a lecture.

The Ecuadorean diplomats said Ecuador would formally ask the U.S. if they intended to take legal action against Mr Assange or ‘an investigation which has identified him as a target and which may result in a later extradition request’.

Mr Assange has been at the embassy since June 19, citing the UN declaration on human rights.

Under the diplomatic protection of the embassy, Mr Assange has been living in a small square room, believe to be just 15 feet wide, with small windows and no outdoor access.

He has been given gym equipment as the embassy has no courtyard.

Outside: Protestors showed their support for Assange outside the embassy in June where he is living in a room, 15 feet wide

The Australian is currently on £200,000 bail after losing his last supreme court appeal against extradition to Sweden, but he cannot be arrested by police unless he steps outside the building where two Metropolitan officers are stationed.

On Wednesday, Ecuador formally invited the Swedish prosecutor to interview Mr Assange inside the embassy but so far Sweden has not responded.

An Ecuadorean political adviser said the country was ‘deeply concerned’ by the possible extradition to America where the death penalty is still practised.

He said: ‘Ecuador has also raised the point and is very much concerned about life sentence.

‘According to our law, life sentence may be equally inhumane in the sense that any person that has no prospect of leaving confinement is, in fact, condemned to a death sentence (for) life.

‘For us that is equally inhumane.’

Secret plans: Assange's American lawyer Michael Ratner is convinced of secret plans and said the death penalty is a real possibility

In June, Assange made a public statement, refusing to comply with a police request to surrender himself.

The statement read outside the embassy by Susan Benn from the Julian Assange Defence Fund said: 'The issues faced by Mr Assange are serious. His life and liberty and the life and liberty of his organisation and those associated with it are at stake.

'The US Government has instigated a grand jury against Julian Assange and other “founders or managers” of WikiLeaks. Australian diplomats have described this investigation as being of ‘unprecedented scale and nature’.

His American lawyer, Michael Ratner is convinced that Assange has been secretly indicted by a grand jury in Washington or face extradition to face prosecution.

He said the death penalty is still a real possibility but that it was highly unlikely that the US Government would confirm their plans to prosecute Assange to the Ecuadorean government or any other party.

The Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Since Mr Assange first entered the Ecuadorean embassy five weeks ago, we have repeatedly made clear to the Ecuadorean government that the UK has a binding legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences.

‘We have been seeking a diplomatic solution and expect Ecuador to resolve this issue in accordance with its international obligations.

 ‘We have gone to great lengths to explain to Ecuador the human rights protections inherent in our law.’
