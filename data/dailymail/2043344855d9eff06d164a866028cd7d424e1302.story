Real Madrid have agreed to pay Manchester United target Toni Kroos £160,000 a week to take him from Bayern Munich after the player favoured a move to Spain over linking up with his former boss.

Louis van Gaal was Bayern Munich coach when Kroos was a young player returning from a successful loan period at Bayer Leverkusen, but the player was put out by the cold welcome he received when he returned to the Allianz Arena.

Kroos always felt happier playing for Van Gaal’s successor Jupp Heynckes, who had also coached him during his loan spell at Leverkusen.

The 24-year-old has agreed a five-year deal with the European Cup holders and now Madrid need to close the deal with Bayern who have allowed his contract to run down to its final year and will accept around £20million for the German international.

Many fans of the the German champions are bemused the club have allowed the midfielder who made his debut at just 17 to slip away, arguing that he is a better player than Mario Gotze - who they spent £30million on last year snatching him from Borussia Dortmund.

Kroos can operate anywhere in Real Madrid’s three-man midfield, joining Luka Modric, Xabi Alonso and Angel Di Maria as Carlo Ancelotti’s options to play behind Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema.

Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola was 
in favour of keeping Kroos but the player’s attitude has been criticised
 by senior figures at the club. Karl Heinze Rummenigge and fellow 
directors criticised him for not wanting to take a penalty in the 
Champions League final against Chelsea two years ago.

His response was that he had missed a spot kick in the previous season’s European Cup semi-final and did not feel confident.

He now looks almost certain to join the club who he missed that penalty against – Real Madrid, leaving United without one of their summer targets.
