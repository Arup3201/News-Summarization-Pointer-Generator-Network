It's the sort of fantasy world that children's dreams are made of.

But as these wonderful pictures show just how Disney world was built, the dream is definitely a reality.

These archive photographs show the incredible amount of work that went into building Walt Disney's sprawling Florida playground.

Today's Kingdom counts four major Disney theme parks, two water parks, six golf courses and a shopping and dining complex.

The Magic Kingdom is pictured slowly starting to take shape - with the famous castle and its turrets clearly seen as the avenues are built around it

Some 9,000 workers were involved in the two-year construction effort. They produced an entertainment paradise around lakes, forests and meadows

Walt Disney wanted a much larger area than Disneyland's 450 acres to develop a total resort - and in 1964 the team purchased nearly 28,000 acres from more than 100 property owners

In 1967 a flurry of work began, including the development of a 45-mile network of water-control channels

And it all began with the Disney founder's dream in the early 1960s to provide a kingdom for those is east of the United States to come and be entertained.

By 1963 the Disney planning team had chosen Florida because of its clement weather conditions, which meant that the park could open all-year-round and the state had already been ranked first in tourism among all states.

Orlando was chosen because of available land and its prime location at the crossroads of major traffic arteries and dynamic growth.

Walt Disney wanted a much larger area 
than Disneyland's 450 acres to develop a total resort - and in 1964 the 
team purchased nearly 28,000 acres from more than 100 property owners - 
costing nearly $5.5 million. Another 2,000 acres have been added since, 
according to the brand.

In
1965 Walt publicly announced his ambition to build the unique 
entertainment and vacation centre and eventually a way of life found 
nowhere else in the world - this was embodied in his EPCOT centre - 
Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow.

Choo choo! Workers created fantasy lands and even built an internal infrastructure that meant visitors could travel round the extensive entertainment complex

Orlando and its clement weather was picked for the destination so that visitors could visit the magical place throughout the year

More than 700million visitors have visited the four theme parks and huge Disney complex - and for many children, it's a dream come true once they visit

Up until his death in December 1966, Walt developed his ideas, directed planning outlined his philosophies for the new complex.

In 1967 a flurry of work began, including the development of a 45-mile network of water-control channels.

Construction for the ambitious project began in April 1969 after an opening date was set for October 1, 1971.Â 

Some 9,000 workers were involved in the two-year construction effort producing an entertainment paradise around lakes, forests and meadows.

During the final 18 months before opening, one million guests visited the Walt Disney World Preview Center where models, drawings and motion pictures explained details of the vast development. Total cost of the project by opening was $400 million.

Clearly the hard work was worth it, as today the four Disney theme parks have welcomed more than 700 million guests.
