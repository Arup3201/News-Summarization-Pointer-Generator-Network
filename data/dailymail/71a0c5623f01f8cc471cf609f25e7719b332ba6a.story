For many years now, a tiny corner of rural Greater Manchester has been purely football.

Past the Trafford Centre, throw a right at the roundabout, through the lights and you get to Carrington, home – among other things – to the training grounds of Manchester's two football clubs.

Take a five-iron and strike it well from United's northerly pitches and the chances are those picking the ball up will be wearing City blue. So close they could hardly escape each other even if they wanted to.

Manchester City have built a new £200million training complex which includes 16 pitches called the Etihad Campus

When United manager Sir Alex Ferguson talked of his club's 'noisy neighbours' this is what he meant.

Today, however, it changes. Today City's players are turning their sports cars and their SUVs east towards the previously neglected Manchester suburbs of Gorton and Beswick. Here, opposite their own Etihad Stadium, lies their new training ground.

Hailed – admittedly by City themselves – as one of the best sporting facilities in the world, the Etihad Campus has cost in the region of £200million to build, has 16 pitches, its own 7,000-seater reserve stadium, an accommodation block and even a sixth-form College to serve its local community. And those are just the things they have told us about.

Carrington, it must be said, was somewhat different. City's home for more than a decade - they previously trained at the rather iconic Platt Lane centre in Manchester's inner-city – it didn't even have a security barrier for many years.

Instead it had a rather fierce looking Scot named 'Michael' who spent his days peering at you from inside a one-man sentry booth decorated with City calendars, posters and gifts from the players. If he knew you, Michael would tell you his latest joke. If he didn't, he would probably scare the life out of you.

This was City pre-Abu Dhabi, though. Things were different, then.

The first manager I encountered there was Kevin Keegan. 'Nice to meet you, I hate your paper,' were his first words to me in the winter of 2001.

Back then the media used to walk round the back of the main building, up some rather fragile-looking stairs that always needed painting and in to a room that doubled up as an analysis 'suite' – it had a round table and some chairs – when we weren't there.

On a shelf on the side was a never ending supply of footballs and black marker pens. Once a week the players would file past and sign.

Keegan was often late, usually because he had been playing head tennis with his coaches out the back.

'Don't say I admitted that,' he once said. 'It will invalidate my medical insurance on my back.'

In the late Sixties, the days of City stars like Mike Summerbee, left, players were put through their paces on an athletics track at Longford Park. Here, the former England international is given tips by ex-Great Britain one-mile runner Stan Taylor

After the Christmas break in 1969, City players were sent on a 30-minute run at Wythenshawe Park to shed off any excess pounds

In those days, players such as Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman ruled the roost at Carrington, waiting round the corner to fire footballs at team-mates emerging in to the complex's wide open spaces from a changing block that looked rather like something out of the film Kes. It was all very high school.

Joey Barton, meanwhile, used to use that area as his own private driving range, golf balls pinging high in to the distance from his driver. A very good golfer, maybe Joey was aiming at Sir Alex across the other side of the hedge.

Keegan once made his exit from Carrington under a blanket on the back seat of a car. His crime? To make a joke about Liverpudlians and hub caps as he signed Fowler. The Sun newspaper sent reporters dressed in black curly wigs to ambush him. 'Michael' on security would have eaten them for his breakfast.

As time passed, things changed. The essence of Carrington never did, though. Even to this day – when City had to erect a big, cold tent to host Champions League press conferences – the throwback feel of the place remains.

Stuart Pearce liked to hold press conferences at 8am. I think it was a macho thing. The problem was that, as results faded, the media just stopped turning up. Maybe that was the plan all along.

City entered a new era when Sven-Goran Eriksson introduced a table to sit behind when he spoke to journalists at press conferences 

Sven made sure he knew everybody's name at Carrington during his time at City, and when he was sacked there were tears from some

Sven-Goran Eriksson, meanwhile, finally introduced a table to sit behind for press conferences. For City, that was progress.

They loved Sven at Carrington, especially the women. He knew everybody's name. When it emerged that he paid for the £2,000-a-night top-floor suite at Manchester's Radisson Edwardian out of his own pocket every night, the Swede's legend only grew.

City weren't bad on the field under Eriksson, either. When he was sacked – unjustly – they cried at Carrington.

On his arrival, Mark Hughes did his best to tart things up a bit. He thought Carrington was 'unfit for purpose' and he was probably right. Given that he had come from Blackburn, though, it said everything.

Hughes disliked the media getting too close so they built us a pre-fabricated hut just inside the entrance while money was spent on the dressing rooms, too.

Pretty soon, Michael on security was no more. Someone didn't like his tattoos apparently.

With the Arab money that soon arrived, Carrington got new signage and some trees lining the driveway that were rumoured to cost £1,000 each. The training ground soon got Roberto Mancini and Mario Balotelli, too.

Mancini often used to cycle to work – with his faithful aide 'Jose' driving behind him in case of 'emergencies' – while the photographers that lined the public footpath nearby feasted on the punch-ups that, for a while, became part of the City story.

I once suggested to one of Mancini's coaches that the club just erect a big fence to protect the sessions from the lenses.

'The council won't let us,' he replied. 'Anyway, it would be cheaper if the players just stopped fighting.'

For a while the bad publicity was a problem for City but, on the whole, they were impressively sanguine.

Across the fence, Ferguson was paranoid about the secrecy of his training sessions, as indeed is Louis van Gaal now.

City, though, took a different view. On learning that one geeky fan was climbing a tree to view sessions through binoculaurs, they didn't set the dogs on him. Instead they invited him inside for a guided tour and a meet-and-greet session.

At the 'Etihad Complex' I suspect things may be a little different. That's what they call progress. If you want to spy on training this week, you may wish to hire a drone.

Manuel Pellegrini and his players will want for nothing, that's for sure. The Premier League is a different place now.

They will still moan, though. Players always do.

For a start – from their homes in the Cheshire enclaves of Wilmslow, Alderley Edge and Prestbury – the new place is a lot more difficult to get to.
