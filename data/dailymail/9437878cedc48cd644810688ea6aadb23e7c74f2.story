Eliana Deur Davidson is suing the City of Whitehorse for damages after she allegedly injured her back ducking from a swooping bird

A Melbourne woman who slipped and injured her back while trying to avoid a swooping bird is suing her local council for damages.

In November 2011 Eliana Deur-Davidson was taking her three-year-old niece to Box Hill South Kindergarten and was walking through the carpark when she realised she was under attack.

In an effort to protect her young family member, the 41-year-old told The Herald Sun she twisted her body to shield her niece from the grey bird that swooped the pair.

This apparently resulted on her landing heavily on one of her knees. Since the incident Ms Deur-Davidson said she had been in and out of hospital, and less than a week ago she underwent spinal surgery to 'shave' one of the discs in her back.

The woman is now suing the City of Whitehorse for damages after she allegedly sustained the back injury during her fall.

In court documents presented to the County Court of Victoria last week lawyers for the woman claimed the local government area in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, breached its duty of care.

The lawyers also said there had been previous complaints about the birds and the council failed to relocate the feathered animals, install devices to deter them or warn residents of the dangers.

Ms Deur-Davidson claimed she had to resign from her job as a youth worker due to ongoing complications from the injury, and she now suffers from severe back pain which means she can't sit down for more than 20 minutes at a time.

'This injury could have been prevented. I just think they needed to take a little more care,' the youth worker, who now walks with a limp, said.

The statement of claim also said since the incident the woman has experienced a psychological trauma in addition to a limitation of movement in her lower back, a disc prolapse and referred pain in her left leg.

In documents lodged at the County Court of Victoria the 41-year-old said the council could have prevented the incident

In a post to her Facebook ahead of her surgery last week, Ms Deur-Davidson thanked her friends, family and husband for their support 'through a hard coupla years (sic)'.

The 41-year-old also said she was looking forward to a 'pain-free life' and she can't wait to 'be able to go for long car rides, for day trips and to go camping again!!'.

In another update just two days ago Ms Deur-Davidson dubbed the operation a 'great success' and she was 'Incredibly happy.'

'I awoke from surgery to find I had absolutely no pain in my left leg. The root nerve had been completely flattened by scar tissue, but is now plump', she wrote.
