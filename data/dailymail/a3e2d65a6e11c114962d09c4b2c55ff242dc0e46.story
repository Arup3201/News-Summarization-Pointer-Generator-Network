Anthony Rodgers allegedly walked into an Ohio bank and passed the teller a note that told her to hand over money or he'd 'shoot yo a--'.

The incident occurred at the Cooper State Bank in Clintonville, Columbus, on July 23.

The 23-year-old made off with about $754 from the robbery, however the teller managed to plant a dye pack amongst the cash.

After being arrested last Tuesday, local police are said to have been quite taken aback with the tattoos that down Rodgers' face - and for good reason.

Colorful character: Anthony Rodgers, 23, has been arrested on a charge of aggravated robbery, but police were shocked to the extent of his facial tattoos

Surveillance: Footage of Rodgers allegedly robbing the Cooper State Bank in Columbus appears to show without his tattoos, perhaps suggesting he used makeup to cover them

On approach: Rodgers is accused of handing the bank teller a note demanding money

Robbery in progress: The teller handed over about $700 in cash, but managed to put a dye bomb in the package

According to Dispatch Columbus, the ink did not show up very clearly in the surveillance footage of the bank.

The site noted some criminals have been known to use make up to cover up distinctive tattoos in order to make themselves less identifiable.

While there is nothing in Rodgers' police report suggesting as such, it is clear his stamps cant be seen by the bank's cameras.

Among the facial art Rodgers has - and which were clearly obvious in his mugshot - is a droplet at the corner of his lips and '69' on his chin.

However most noticeably he has 'Truly Blessed' across his forehead.

Rodgers left the bank on foot and got into the passenger seat of a black BMW, according to the Columbus police report.

Witnesses said the dye pack exploded before he got into the car.
