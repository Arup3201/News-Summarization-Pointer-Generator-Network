Swansea boss Garry Monk says his players will need to be brave if they are to beat Stoke at the Britannia Stadium for the first time in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday.

Monk's side have enjoyed an excellent start to the campaign and currently sit fifth in the table, level on points with Manchester United.

The Swans' momentum has, however, slowed in recent weeks with the team winless in their last four league matches.

Garry Monk said Swansea's players need self-belief ahead of their Premier League clash with Stoke City

'Stoke is never an easy place to go and we know we have never won there in the Premier League,' Monk told Swansea's official club website.

'However, we should have won the last time we played there in February, so hopefully we can repeat that performance and get the victory.

'They (Stoke) try and play football but they still have that direct aspect of their game, which makes them dangerous.

'We have to go there with belief and impose ourselves on the game.'

Swansea have started the season well and are currently fifth but have failed to win in their last four games

Swansea will be looking to get back to winning ways as soon as possible, having recorded consecutive draws against Newcastle and Sunderland.

The international break has given Monk and his squad time to reflect on their season so far and the Swans boss says his team will be raring to go come Sunday.

'It's the same for every team but we will give the players all the information they need in order to be ready for Sunday's game,' Monk added.

'It's difficult when half the squad is away, but we have still had a lot of players who have featured in the first team on a regular basis so we've managed to do plenty of offensive and defensive work.'
