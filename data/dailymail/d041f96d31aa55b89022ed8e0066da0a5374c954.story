A group of board members from one of Manhattan's most luxury apartment buildings are trying to shut down construction of a new multi-million dollar spa because of its nudist-friendly policies which they say 'violate public morals'.

The stuffy campaigners, who have lodged their suit in the Manhattan Supreme Court, live in the Ritz Tower on Park Avenue, which overlooks the neighboring Galleria Building, the home of the first Manhattan-based Spa Castle.  

Despite the fact that the venue only allows guests to be nude while they are indoors, the residents insist that their scenic views of the city will be forever marred whenever they catch a glimpse of the spa's more free-spirited guests who choose to enjoy its many amenities while in the buff.

Restricted rooftop: According to the lawsuit which was filed in the Manhattan Supreme Court, the spa's rooftop amenities are in violation of a 40-year-old building resctriction

No clothes? No way! The board members insist that the spa's nudity-friendly policy 'violates public morals'

While the majority of Manhattanites have rejoiced at the arrival of the new mega-spa, which already has a sister site in Queens, it appears that prospect of having the luxurious, but nudist-friendly, venue right on their doorstep has done nothing but anger the Ritz Tower board.

And it's not just the thought of glimpsing naked spa-goers that has riled the campaigners. 

In addition to their fears about preserving the neighborhood's moral code, the group also argue that the spa's rooftop construction violates a 1974 restriction which prevents the Galleria Building from being any higher than 82.35 feet. 

According to New York Post, the restriction ensures that they be granted 'unrestricted light, air, and a view over a portion of the Galleria building', all of which are under threat thanks to the spa's construction. 

The group's lawsuit specifies that the Spa Castle's impressive array of rooftop comforts - which include hot tubs, foot-soaking stations and a cabana-style roof - are all in violation of the height restriction and must therefore be removed. 

'The height, placement and use of the newly constructed roof and spa facilities... [and] their proximity to the windows of the residential apartments in 465 Park Avenue, obstruct the view of the tenants and residents who occupy the apartments overlooking the roof of the Galleria Building,' the suit says, according to the New York Daily News. 

Stuffy standards: The residents of the Ritz Tower on Park Avenue are also angered by the spa's rooftop construction which they say violates local building restrictions

Luxury lifestyle: Despite the Ritz Tower group's anger, many other Manhattanites are eagerly awaiting the spa's launch

'[The] ongoing construction constitutes a public nuisance because it offends, interferes with, and causes damage to the public, including by offending public morals.' 

Despite the group's complaints however, construction on the luxurious venue has not only continued but has, they argue, actually sped up since they sent their first cease and desist letter back in September.

According to the riled-up residents of the Ritz Tower, where a four-bedroom apartment goes for an average of $3.6 million, work now begins as early as 7am, even on Sundays, an outrage which seems to have only added to their anger.

The Spa Castle Premier 57 is set to be the first of a number of the Spa Castle chain's luxury brand extensions. It will be the first of its kind to be opened in the center of Manhattan, having already won over the local residents in Queens, the home of its first New York venue.  

There's no stopping them! Construction on the luxury venue has not stopped, despite the lawsuit, and the spa is still due to open later this month

'Complete wellness for the mind and body': The spa's website describes the new venue as an 'escape into the extraordinary' 

'Located in the heart of Manhattan, Premier 57 offers an escape into the extraordinary,' the website explains. 'What lie inside are ancient and worldly health cultures, designed to deliver complete wellness for the mind, body, and soul. 

'Focused on heat therapy, Premier 57 specializes in providing opulent hydrotherapy facilities along with a collection of unique sauna room treatments. First class spa treatments, savory snacks and beverages, and an outdoor roof deck only enhance the Premier experience found within.'

The spa will take up the seventh, eighth and ninth floors of the Galleria Tower - as well as the rooftop - and is set to open later this month. 

Robert Lash, a spokesperson for Spa Castle, told MailOnline: 'In terms of Spa Castle Premier 57 and pending litigation, Manhattan Supreme Court today denied the Ritz Tower’s request for a temporary restraining order and set a further hearing for a later date. 

'Under the terms of the easement, Spa Castle Premier 57 is permitted to use the roof, and will vigorously defend against this lawsuit. Regarding the rooftop area in question, full nudity is not permitted outside of the facility’s designated male and female locker rooms and bathing area.'
