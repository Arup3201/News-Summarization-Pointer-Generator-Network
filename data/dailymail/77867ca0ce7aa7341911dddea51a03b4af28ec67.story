Victor Anichebe has revealed he will put himself through a personal boot camp to revive his season.

The West Brom striker is ready for a fitness drive during the international break after his injury struggles. 

He had a hernia operation in September and made his first Barclays Premier League start since August in Sunday’s 2-0 defeat to Newcastle.

The Baggies next go to Chelsea on November 22 and Anichebe is planning to return fighting fit.

He said: 'For me, over the international break, I need to go away, come back and be as fit as possible. I don't feel as sharp and fit as I was at the start of the season but that will come.

'I came back about a month or six weeks ago from hernia surgery, something which reoccurred after I did it a couple of years ago.

'I need to go away, come back and take care of my own body and be fitter than I have been recently.

'I have the medical team here, they have helped me a lot and I have guys in America I have worked with a lot. Between the two we have come up with a fitness regime which will help me to get to where I should be.

Anichebe said that he will take full advantage of the international break by getting back to full fitness

Since his £6million move from Everton in September, Anichebe has made just 16 starts for the Baggies

'I will go away and I will do parts to try to get myself ready but I'll also be with the team. We just need to come back after the international break and be ready for the difficult fixtures ahead of us.'

The former Everton starlet has only netted four goals for Albion since his £6million move from the Toffees in September last year.

He has also made just 16 starts for the Baggies in over 12-months after struggling with a series of minor injuries.

Anichebe has scored once in eight appearances this term and is desperate to prove his worth at The Hawthorns.

'For me it's very difficult,' said the 26-year-old. 'I had niggling injuries here and there and I have just come back from hernia surgery and I had some complications. That's not an excuse or anything, it's just normal.

'I feel a lot better and hopefully, given the break we've got, I can go away, get myself right and come back and help the team.'
