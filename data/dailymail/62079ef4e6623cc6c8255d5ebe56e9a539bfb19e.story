Motorists believe hands-free driving and digital radios are the next big technological advances behind the wheel, according to new research.

Lazy drivers want to take the hassle out of driving, with 40 per cent wanting self-park buttons and 35 per cent believing voice commands are the future of motoring.

However, despite yearning for hands-free driving, the top in-car innovation demanded by drivers is the digital radio, research on 1,551 motorists by Auto Trader and Digital Radio UK reveals.

Although 15 per cent of British drivers already have digital radios in their car, 41 per cent say DAB radios are the next big thing for in-car technology.

And, despite the Government indicating the digital radio switch-over might take place in the next couple of years, many motorists have not yet bought a DAB radio for their car because they are wrongly concerned about price.

Motoring experts Auto Trader and Digital Radio UK say despite installation only costing around £30, drivers think it will set them back £202 on average - more than double the actual cost - but do realise it will drive up their car's value.

Nick King, director at Auto Trader, said: 'Digital technology has transformed the way consumers see the world over the past decade and motorists are no different.

Google has been developing autonomous car technology
and lobbying for the regulations.

The company's fleet of a dozen computer-controlled
vehicles has logged more than 300,000 miles of self-driving without an
accident, according to Google.

'I think the self-driving car can really dramatically
improve the quality of life for everyone,' Google co-founder Sergey Brin said.

Autonomous cars can make roads safer, free commuters from
the drudgery of driving, reduce congestion and provide transport to people who
can't drive themselves, such as the blind, disabled, elderly and intoxicated,
Brin said.

'I expect that self-driving cars will be far safer than
human-driven cars,' Brin said.

'They have seen how voice recognition has changed phones and how apps have made previously complex things solvable at the press of a button.

They now want motoring to be made as easy as possible by putting these features in cars.

'As we have seen in many other industries, the companies who respond and adapt best to changing consumer need will benefit most in the years to come.

'At the moment motorists have conflicting views on digital radio.

'Despite the fact it is already here they think it will be the next great innovation and despite believing it will be an investment and add value to their car they hugely over-estimate the costs involved in getting one.

'When the date of the digital switch-over is confirmed more people will have DABs fitted to their cars as potential buyers will demand it.'
