Lukas Podolski needs no invitation to take a selfie, so the Germany striker wasn't about to let the opportunity pass him by after winning the World Cup.

The Arsenal star was an unused substitute as Germany defeated Argentina 1-0 after extra-time in the final played at the Maracana in Rio.

But Podolski celebrated with his team-mates after the final whistle by getting out his smart phone and posing for a shot with team-mate Bastian Schweinsteiger who gave him a kiss on the cheek.

 team has done superbly, not only the players, but also the team behind 
the team. At some point we will stop celebrating, but we will always 
stand up again with a smile.'
