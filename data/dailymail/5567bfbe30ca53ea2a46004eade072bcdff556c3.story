A daughter who fled with her mother a decade ago during a custody dispute must appear in court if she is to testify in her mother's defence - but she is in hiding and it's not clear if she will come forward.

A lawyer acting for Genevieve Kelly had requested that her daughter Mary Nunes, now 18, be allowed to give a videotaped testimony in her mother's trial on custodial interference charges.

But the judge in the case yesterday rejected the request, ruling that Miss Nunes needs to be questioned by prosecutors first, because the state has no idea what she is planning to testify.

Miss Nunes was eight when she fled with her mother from Lancaster, New Hampshire. Kelley turned herself in to authorities in November on custodial interference charges.

She said she wants a trial, and her lawyer said Ms Nunes plans to testify for her mother.

But Alan Rosenfeld, for Kelly, had asked that Miss Nunes's testimony be videotaped, saying she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2004 and would suffer mental or emotional strain if she has to testify in court.

Prosecutor John McCormick responded that while the state is sensitive to the well-being of Ms Nunes, if she is going to be a witness, she should appear at trial, not as part of a 'packaged videotaped presentation.'

Judge Peter Bornstein, ruling that Ms Nunes should not be allowed to give video-taped testimony, said he had no evidence that the diagnosis from 2004 would affect her today, and that even if there were evidence, 'it's so remote in time.'

When asked how he would find Ms Nunes, Mr McCormick said, 'That's a good question.' He said he hoped the defence would help arrange the meeting. 

Since their disappearance ten years ago, U.S. Marshals have searched in the US, Canada and Central America for the daughter, mother and her new husband Scott Kelley.

The mother said she violated a family court decision to protect her daughter from her ex-husband, Dr Mark Nunes, whom she alleges sexually abused the child.

The father was investigated, but not charged. Authorities felt the man was unfairly accused.

Law enforcement concluded that Mrs Kelley mistreated the child. 

Kelley and Dr Nunes divorced in 1998 and the mother moved to back to the northern town New Hampshire town where her parents lived.

The couple communicated through a notebook that Mary would shuttle back and forth, before a visit to her father's house was cancelled in 2003.

Kelley said she fled during the custody battle over Mary to avoid a greater harm to her child, but prosecutor John McCormick said that defense doesn't apply under state law.

The prosecutor says the protection defense only applies if Mrs Kelley had stayed in New Hampshire with the girl.  

Mr Rosenfeld said the law is meant to prevent that defense from being available to parents who take children out of state as part of an alleged crime.

The protection defense is one of many motions Justice Peter Bornstein is likely to hear today. 

Ms Kelley's lawyers, who specialize in cases involving mothers kidnapping their children amid abuse allegations, have also asked that the judge not decide whether to allow her defenses until after evidence is heard, according to the Union Leader.

Mr Rosenfeld said it would be up to prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mrs Kelley left after no longer having a legal right to do so. 

The defendant was not present for the hearing that gave Dr Nunes custody of Mary.

The lawyer said Ms Kelley plans to offer testimony that at a point where her daughter's court-appointed guardian and social service agencies 'had chosen not to believe' what the girl said, the legal system was unable to protect her.

'Simply put, there was no lawful alternative to provide safety for this child,' he wrote.

Mr McCormick said the investigation into whether Mary was abused was 'greatly compromised' by Mrs Kelley's actions.

He said because Ms Kelley intentionally refused to follow the court's order for Mary to be evaluated in 2004, 'she all but sabotaged the prospect of ever bringing Mary's alleged abuser to justice'. 

US Marshals say that Mrs Kelley and her daughter originally fled on their own passports and made a stop in Honduras or Guatemala. 

The Friends of Genevieve Kelley group helped post the mother's $250,000 bail after she returned to New Hampshire to face trial

The girl is no longer subject to family court after reaching the age of majority, and Mrs Kelley made contact with authorities last spring.

Mrs Kelley said that she returned because her nine-year-old son needs medical treatment for cystic fibrosis, according to the Boston Globe  

The defense lawyer says that the daughter is anxious to return to living with her Mrs Kelley after the trial is resolved. 

Dr Nunes, who is remarried and lives in Ohio, issued a statement saying that his daughter 'has been told falsehoods and misstatements on the events of her youth'.

Mrs Kelley, a family practice doctor, is thought to have stopped in Honduras or Guatemala after fleeing New Hampshire

Ms Kelley was released from jail on January 7 after supporters posted $250,000 cash bail, and is living with her son.

The defendant is not allowed to have contact with her daughter or with her husband, 50-year-old Scott Kelley, who also is missing and is charged with custodial interference.

He remains as one of New Hampshire's most wanted.

The prosecutor has asked for access to Ms Kelley's passport in hopes of locating her daughter.

Mr Rosenfeld objected, saying she would be producing evidence against herself, in violation of her constitutional rights against self-incrimination.
