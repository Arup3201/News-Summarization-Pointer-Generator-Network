Jamie Carragher believes Chelsea captain John Terry is the best defender to have ever graced the Premier League. 

Terry, 34, has enjoyed another impressive season at Stamford Bridge and was the star performer as he led Jose Mourinho's side to a 0-0 draw against Arsenal on Sunday.

The draw at the Emirates means Chelsea now need just six points from five games to claim their first Premier League title since 2010.

Carragher insists Terry deserves much of the credit, saying on Sky Sports: 'There’s no doubt that, just behind (Eden) Hazard in this Chelsea team, Terry has been the most influential.

'We’ve seen (Cesc) Fabregas, (Nemanja) Matic and Diego Costa feature in the early part of the season, but if you look at Terry’s display (against Arsenal) he was outstanding.

'We talk about Chelsea being a defensive team, but sometimes you’ve got to say they defend brilliantly, and Terry is the best.

'There have been a lot of great centre-backs in Premier League history, but I think he has been the best that we’ve seen.'

Blues boss Mourinho was also quick to praise his captain after Sunday's draw and even claimed it was Terry's best performance in a Chelsea shirt. 

Mourinho said: 'I told John Terry in the dressing room that he made fantastic performances with me in six years but for me this was the best I have seen from him. 

'It was the best JT has ever played. His defensive performance was absolutely amazing.'
