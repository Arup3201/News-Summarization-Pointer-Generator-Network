The only Victoria Cross medal awarded for the British campaign in Tibet 110 years ago became the most expensive sold at auction yesterday when it was sold for £408,000.

The medal was bought by billionaire Lord Ashcroft, who holds the world’s biggest collection of Victoria Cross medals estimated to be worth £40 million.

The Victoria Cross awarded to Lieutenant John Duncan Grant, will join the other 183 medals in Lord Ashcroft’s collection on display at the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum.

The medal went for the hammer price of £340,000 but with a 20 per cent fee from the auctioneers Morton and Eden the final price comes to £408,000.

This smashes the previous record of a hammer price in the British Isles of £290,000 for a Victoria Cross.

This is the first time this medal has been available to purchase as it has remained in the Grant family.

The Victoria Cross is the highest military decoration awarded for valour ‘in the face of the enemy’ and was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour bravery during the Crimean War. The medal has been awarded 1,357 times to 1,354 individual recipients, but there was only one awarded during the campaign to Tibet.

Lieutenant John Duncan Grant led a force sent to Tibet to negotiate with the Dalai Lama to prevent Russian encroachment into India through Tibet.

However, in order to reach the sacred city of Lhasa, Grant had to breach the formidable fortress of Gyantse Jong, which sat on top of a sheer cliff face.

Grant led the storming party of Gurkhas to capture the fortress on the 6th July 1904.

He was the first Gurkha to scale the sheer rock-face but was wounded by the enemy. But Grant climbed over into enemy territory and led his men to victory.

Times Correspondent Perceval Landon, filed a witness account of the storming of the fortress in 1904. He wrote: ‘They reached at last the crumbling wreckage of the Tibetan wall.

‘Leutenent Grant and his faithful follower were the first two men over, and the great semi-circle of the watching British force held their breath to see if they would be at once shot down.’

Companions: He led a company of Ghurka soldiers into battle but was shot and wounded during a 'fracas'

He was awarded a the Victoria Cross by Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on July 24, 1905.

Grant was also awarded a Distinguished Service Order and Order of the Bath, which were also sold alongside the Victoria Cross.

Michael Naxton, the curator of The Ashcroft Collection, said: ‘I can assure you Lord Ashcroft will be absolutely delighted to have such an interesting addition to the collection.

‘It will fill a notable gap in the collection. ‘

Auctioneer James Morton said: ‘It’s a wonderful outcome as the medal will stay in British ownership and will be on display. It’s a very unique Victoria Cross as it is the only medal awarded for the campaign in Tibet and has a great story behind it.’   

Grant, who was born in India but educated at Cheltenham College, continued his service in India during the First World War and also served in the Third Afghan War. During the Second World War Grant served with the Home Guard in London and he died in a nursing home in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in 1967.
