A council has finally apologised over the way it handled a decision to remove three Eastern European children from foster parents who were members of Ukip.

Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council maintained that the removal of the siblings last November was in their 'best interests'.

But it also said membership of the UK Independence Party was not a valid reason to take foster children from their carers and the issue was badly communicated.

U-turn: Joyce Thacker, Rotherham Borough Council's head of children's services, said in November that social workers had been right to remove three children from the care of their UKIP member foster parents, but now the council has admitted that party membership was not a valid reason to take action

In a statement, the local authority said a
 detailed review had found that the action to remove the brother and 
sisters was in their best interests.

It added: 'However, we accept the impression left following media interviews on the morning of November 24 was that the removal of the children was solely because of the foster carers' membership of Ukip and the council apologises for this.

'As this is a child care case, legal reasons continue to prevent us from releasing further details. However, we know that there are important lessons the council must learn.

'As a consequence, the council has taken action to strengthen the way it makes decisions, communicates and shares information.'

The children, a baby girl, a boy and an older girl, were removed by social workers after the council reportedly received an anonymous tip-off about the foster parents' membership of the right-wing party.

Social workers reportedly said they were concerned about the children's 'cultural and ethnic needs'.

The head of children’s services in Rotherham defended the decision, saying that their affiliation to Ukip meant they opposed ‘multiculturalism.’

Joyce Thacker, Rotherham Borough Council’s director of children and young people’s services, said the children’s ‘cultural and ethnic needs’ did not fit with the parent’s ‘strong views.’

But in today's statement, Rotherham council clarified its position on party membership.

'The council can confirm that membership of Ukip would not prevent any individual from being considered as a foster carer in Rotherham and could not be a reason for removing foster children from a placement,' it said.

In November, the couple, a qualified 
nursery nurse and a former Royal Navy reservist, were backed by 
Education Secretary Michael Gove.

Mr Gove said social workers had made 'the wrong decision in the wrong way for the wrong reasons'.

He pledged to personally investigate the case, adding: 'Rotherham's reasons for denying this family the chance to foster are indefensible.'

The birth parents of the three children were later revealed to be a Slovakian couple who have had six of their offspring taken away by social workers.

The father accused council staff of 'racism' and of destroying his family as he told how 20 police officers ‘raided’ their home to remove their last four children.

He claimed social workers picked on the family because they are Roma and disapproved of their non-British 'lifestyle'.

As reported in the Daily Mail in December, the Slovak father told friends: 'It is the social services who have been racist against my family.'

The foster parents said they were planning legal action after their foster agency said the council had accused them of leaking information to the press about the children and their birth parents.

They told the Guardian in December: 'If Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council are accusing us of a breach of confidentiality and do not issue a formal apology in order to clear our name we may be forced to seek legal action to protect our future as foster parents.'

Ukip today said it did not wish to comment on the council's statement.
