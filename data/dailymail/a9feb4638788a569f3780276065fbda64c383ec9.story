Two conjoined twins separated at the chest last year are expected to be released from the hospital this week.

Owen and Emmett Ezell were born last July, were joined at the abdomen and chest and suffered from other medical problems that made them living apart a risky proposition.

They had been hospitalized since their separation last August, and are still being fed through tubes in their abdomens, according to KDFW, but are well enough to take the next steps of their recovery at a rehabilitation center.

Separated: They were surgically separated one month later

This is the next step to getting the boys home with their family,’ the hospital said in a press release.

The two boys weighed a combined 11 pounds, 15 ounces at birth and grew to weight of almost 16 pounds by the time of their surgery, according to CBS DFW.

The Ezell’s spent the past several months moving from a feeding tube to an IV to their current state, breathing on their own and healing from their surgery, according to NBC DFW.

They also shared a liver and bowels, and also suffered from a rare medical disorder where their intestines were left outside their bodies and covered only by a thin layer of tissue, according to CBS DFW.

Rehab will help the boys heal further, but it will also be an opportunity for the boys’ parents to learn how to manage the feeding tubes until they can eat on their own.

It is not clear how long they will need to rehabilitate until they are allowed to go home.

Hospital sources told NBC DFW the boys are scheduled to be released Wednesday.A celebration will be held by hospital staff in their honor.

The family has been blogging about the twins’ recovery since they were separated, but the last post was made two weeks ago.

They are raising money to help pay for the boys’ medical care through the sale of t-shirts on the blog and through donations.
