UEFA are set to launch a formal investigation into the anti-Semitic banner that marred Tottenham's goalless draw against Partizan Belgrade. 

The banner displayed among the Serbian supporters during the Europa League tie read: ‘Only Jews and Pussies’ — an allusion to the TV comedy Only Fools and Horses.

Delegates from European football’s governing body were made aware of the banner before half-time, yet no effort was made to take it down.

Tottenham, who have a strong Jewish tradition, are expected to make an official complaint within the next 48 hours.

Anti-discrimination body Kick It Out meanwhile has urged UEFA to send a clear message to clubs around Europe after the incident.

Kick It Out said it had been made aware of the unsavoury scenes via a ‘large number’ of Spurs fans on Twitter and confirmed it had informed Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE).

FARE said it has made an official complaint to UEFA, who is officially awaiting the match delegate’s report.

‘These incidents seem to be happening in particular countries and in certain parts of Europe where they don’t take them as seriously as we do on our shores,’ Kick It Out’s media and communications manager Richard Bates said.

 ‘Incidents aren’t dealt with in the appropriate manner within those countries - if they don’t take a firm stance and they’re allowed to slide, the reality is it will continue to happen.

‘We need UEFA to take a lead, which they have done more over the last couple of years, and demonstrate clearly that these sorts of incidents are completely unacceptable.’

Bates added: ‘It’s always disappointing when any incident like this occurs. ‘It’s disheartening, it’s not acceptable in any way and, after a thorough investigation, it needs to be dealt with in the appropriate manner.’ 

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino branded the banner as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘disrespectful’.

He said: ‘I didn’t see (it) but the club is aware. It is very disrespectful. It is a shame as it was a great atmosphere. It is very disrespectful, unacceptable and a massive problem for us.’

If Partizan are found guilty they could have part of their ground shut for European competition.

They were kicked out of this competition when it was the UEFA Cup in 2007 after crowd trouble marred their first qualifying round tie at Bosnia’s Zrinjski Mostar.

On the pitch, this match was less eventful. As goalless draws go, this was pretty awful. But Pochettino knows it could have been worse.

But for a 10-minute spell at the start, Partizan dominated without finding the goal their performance probably deserved.

Pochettino made 10 changes from the side who started against Sunderland on Saturday, Hugo Lloris the only survivor from the 2-2 draw. 

There were full debuts for summer signings Federico Fazio and Benjamin Stambouli, while Harry Kane was handed another chance to impress ahead of Roberto Soldado.

On Wednesday night, Pochettino insisted the Europa League is a priority for Spurs, although a host of first-teamers did not travel. Spurs fans need convincing, however: just 150 made the trip.

Kane nearly gave them something to shout about in the first minute, hitting the crossbar with a sharp angled shot after Partizan failed to deal with Ben Davies’s corner.

Partizan, who have won all five in their league this season, gradually found their stride with Miroslav Vulicevic and Petar Grbic, in particular, causing Spurs problems down the right. 

Danko Lazovic saw his shot blocked by Fazio in the 15th minute following excellent work from impressive right winger Grbic.

The Argentine manager had left regular left back Danny Rose in England; he may have regretted that given Davies’s difficult start.

Andros Townsend tried to shift the flow of the game, but his runs down the right were too few and far between for Pochettino’s liking.

On the half-hour Grbic again eluded Davies before picking out Sasa Ilic at the back post, only for the Partizan captain to blaze over.

Davies’s nightmare continued three minutes after the restart as he was booked for hauling down Grbic.

Lloris denied Grbic twice before Pochettino decided enough was enough, throwing on Erik Lamela and Soldado. 

But Partizan continued to pour forward: Sasa Ilic sent a shot from outside the area over the bar before directing a diving header at goal after 76 minutes.

Kane’s 25-yard free-kick straight at Partizan’s wall in the 83rd minute summed up Spurs’ night in an attacking sense.
