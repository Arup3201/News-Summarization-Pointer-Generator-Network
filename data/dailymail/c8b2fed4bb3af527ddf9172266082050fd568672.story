Everything to live for: Vanessa Chango-Alvarez, 31, was mowed down by a car as she waited for a bus in Streatham, London

A woman was knocked down and killed in a hit-and-run by a driver being followed by police in connection with a crash a few miles away.

Hotel receptionist Vanessa Chango-Alvarez, 31, was mowed down by an Audi A3 at a bus stop outside her mother’s house in Norbury, South London, as she set off for work.

A man aged in his 50s was also left critically injured.

Police were yesterday searching for the driver of the Audi.

Minutes earlier a Volkswagen car had ploughed into a tree in Croydon, leaving its driver, aged in his 20s, critically injured.

An Audi car pulled up at the scene but when police arrived, the driver made off in his car.

Officers are investigating the possibility that the Audi and Volkswagen may have been racing.

Yesterday, Miss Chango-Alvarez’s brother Kevin, 19, said she had stayed at her mother’s home after a family gathering to celebrate the birth of her nephew.

After he was woken by the crash at 5.30am on Saturday, he ran outside to find his sister unconscious on the pavement. He said: 'We are all in shock. We are completely heartbroken.

'I still can't accept my sister has gone. I feel so much anger and hatred towards the driver of that car.

'He didn't even have the decency to stop. He just ran away and left my sister dying on the pavement.

'I was asleep inside and I remember hearing a big bang and thought there had been an explosion.

'But
when I looked out I saw the crash. I went outside and it was my sister,
my beautiful sister - she had been in the wrong place at the wrong 
time.

Scene: Ms Chango-Alvarez was struck by a car in Streatham High Road, south London

'She had got up early to go to work. It was her last day at work before Christmas.

'She was unconscious when I got to her. There was nothing I could do. I was with her when she died, she wasn't alone.

'I just hope the driver is caught so justice can be served. He has taken away my sister and ruined our lives.'

Ms Chango-Alvarez, who was born in Ecuador, South America, came to England when she was 17 and after a two-year English course found work at St Giles Hotel, in central London.

Her brother said: 'She had worked there for 13 years. She started at the bottom and kept getting promoted because she was such a hard worker.

Probe: The Audi which hit the victim in Streatham had minutes earlier been at the scene when a VW hit a tree in nearby Ederline Avenue, Croydon. Police believe the two cars may have been racing

'My sister was such a kind person. She never had any problems with anybody and we all loved her so much.

'She was the oldest sibling and we all looked up to her as a role model. She was always there for us.

'She wanted to travel the world, but now she won't get the chance.

'We were all so excited about spending Christmas together, but there won't be a Christmas anymore.'

Ms
Chango-Alvarez. who lived in Tulse Hill, South London with one of her 
sisters Adriana, 30, had another sister Elizabeth, 25, who had just 
given birth to her first son, Israel.

Her
mother, Fanny Alvarez, 55, who is divorced from her father, Raul 
Chango, said: 'I still can't believe my daughter is dead, my beautiful 
and kind daughter.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said : 'Police are continuing to investigate two collisions in south London which have left one woman dead and two men injured.'
