Thousands of snippets of data have been gathered to provide a detailed look at one of New York City's most iconic sights - the yellow cab.

An info-graphic by Vizual-statistix this week has revealed that the most common first name in 2014 among the 52,131 authorized  drivers (those behind the wheel of both yellow cabs and limousines) is Mohammad - and alternate spellings MD, Mohammed, Muhammad, and Mohamed. The next most common names were Jean and Abdul.

The most common surname is Singh followed by Rahman and Islam, according to the wealth of information available for public use through the project NYC Open Data.

According to city statistics, New York cab drivers are the epitome of diversity. Cabbies come from all of the Big Apple's five boroughs; 31 states (and D.C). and more than 175 countries around the world.

More than 10,000 yellow cab drivers come from Bangladesh (23 per cent), close to 6,000 from Pakistan (13 per cent) while U.S.-born drivers made up 6 per cent. 

The profession continues to be male dominated - with around 49,500 men at the wheel compared to just 536 women. The average age of a yellow cab driver is 46 years old - with the youngest aged 19 and as of August 2013, the oldest was 94.

Creator of the infographic, Seth Kadish, told Daily Mail Online on Wednesday that he creates the data-based graphics as a hobby and that his taxi-driver graphs and tables took around an hour to complete.

Mr Kadish, who lives in Portland, Oregon, is a data scientist by trade for California-based company Chegg.

He was inspired to collate taxi driver names after a previous graphic he had seen about salon worker names.

In order to create the graphic, Mr Kadish explained, he did not take middle names into account but allowed alternate spellings of the same name. 

On his Tumblr account, he added: 'The heat map below the bar graphs shows the frequency of first and last name pairings. This hints at the diversity of first or last names in some countries compared to others. 

'For example, Singh is the most common last name, but none of the most common first names are paired with it - it is traditionally a last name in India, but due to the diversity of first names in India, none of them are in the top 20. 

'The most common first name paired with Singh is Balwinder, which is the 52nd most common first name. 

'Conversely, Jean (the French version of John) is the sixth most common first name, but is not associated with any of the top 20 last names. Francois, the most common last name paired with Jean, is not even among the 100 most common last names.'

The data scientist has created many info-graphics on a wide range of subjects and said he is often influenced to seek out data by what he reads in the news. 

The cab driver info-graphic was created after a glut of stories about Uber - but Mr Kadish couldn't analyze the controversial transport company's data because it isn't shared publicly.

His other recent graphics include 'The correlation between police presence and black populations in US cities'; 'Meeting expectations in Fantasy Football' and 'The Global Prisoner Population by Country'.

The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission has also created its own graphic about yellow cabs where it explains that 60 per cent of the yellow taxi fleet are now hybrid vehicles - leading to 190,000 fewer tons of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere each year.

Other fascinating facts for 2014 about NYC's yellow cabs include that a typical taxi travels 70,000 miles per year - far enough to make it round the world, 2,8 times. 

According to date from the City of New York, more than 10,000 yellow cab drivers come from Bangladesh (23 per cent), close to 6,000 from Pakistan (13 per cent) while U.S.-born drivers made up around 6 per cent
