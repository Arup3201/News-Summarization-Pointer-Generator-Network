A new 'anti-hunger' powder claims to help dieters by making them feel fuller after eating just small amounts of food.

Added to smoothies, soups or fruit shakes the dust-like powder turns to a gel once it reaches the stomach meaning that the user will consume less calories in the meals afterwards, and lose weight as a result.

A form of this magic diet powder, methyl cellulose, has been used as a popular food additive for over fifty years, binding together baked goods, snacks and ready meals.

Normally it would pass through the system, but this modified version has been designed as a satiety ingredient to form a gel at body temperature that lingers safely in the stomach before passing in to the small intestine.

Volunteers at trials consumed an average of 13 per cent fewer calories when given a second meal two hours after taking the powder, which dissolves in cold water.

Carsten Huettermann Ph.D. the scientist who presented the report in Philadelphia said: 'This ingredient would make people feel full after eating smaller amounts of food,'

'With that sense of fullness and hunger-satisfaction, they would not crave more food.

'In our first study, we saw that fewer calories were consumed at the following meal after eating our new product.

'Our next step now is to investigate in further studies the mechanism of action and whether this may have an impact on weight management.'

A report by an FSA advisory committee said it ‘did not have any safety concerns relating to this ingredient’ but suggests it should not be given to children.

They have asked food experts for their opinion before a decision is taken on approving it for use. 

Emma Williams of the Nutrition Society said: ‘Although these findings are interesting, because this is a proof of concept study much more research is needed to understand the processes and mechanisms of action, as well as the implications for long term weight reduction.’

In its original form methyl cellulose is used as an additive in processed foods.

The additive is used to bind food together and passes straight through the system without acting as any kind of satiety ingredient.

Chemists have modified the ingredient to use as a potential weight management tool, and the updated methyl cellulose powder has been named SATISFIT-LTG.

SATISFIT-LTG is a white powder dissolved in water and then added to edible liquids like smoothies, soups and shakes which turns in to a thick gel-like paste once it reaches room temperature in the stomach.

This makes the user feel more full as it hangs around for a few hours before passing safely through to the small intestine and out of the body.

In recent clinical trials the volunteers ate an average of 17 per cent fewer calories in their second meal after eating SATISFIT-LTG in their first meal.

The scientists are developing SATISFIT-LTG as a potential ingredient in cold foods and Dr Huettermann has reported that work will continue based on the promising clinical trial results.
