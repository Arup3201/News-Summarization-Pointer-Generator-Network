Hillary Clinton is letting it be known how she feels about childhood vaccines.

The recent grandmother and near certain Democratic presidential candidate did not mince words, keeping her statement brief and to the point by releasing it on Twitter.

'The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Let's protect all our kids. #GrandmothersKnowBest,' wrote the former Secretary of State.

This just hours after two other politicians who have been exploring the idea of a presidential run, Republicans Chris Christie and Rand Paul, came under fire for stating they did not believe in mandatory child vaccinations.

The potential Democratic presidential candidate kept her statement short and sweet by releasing it on Twitter

Governor Christie was touring a biomedical research facility of all places in Cambridge, England when he said of vaccinations; 'Parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that's the balance that the government has to decide.'

He did however make it clear that he and his wife had all of their children vaccinated.

Now, many are attacking Christie for being 'anti-science,' while members of his own party are wondering if this muted response is a sign that the oft polarizing politician - who is nothing if not direct when answering questions - is toning things down as he sets his sights on a job in the White House.

The backlash was so immediate that Christie's camp released a clarification on his statement within just hours.

'To be clear: the Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated,' said spokesman Kevin Roberts according to CNN. 

'At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate.'

Chris Christie (left) and Rand Paul (right) both said on Monday that families should have a choice when it comes to vaccines, a statement Christie quickly backtracked on

Christie's office stressed that the New Jersey Governor and his wife Mary Pat (above with Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne on Tuesday) have vaccinated all their children

In stark contrast to Clinton's firm support of vaccinations, and even Christie's middle-of-the-road beliefs, is Senator Paul, a former medical doctor who believes that vaccines should be 'voluntary.'

'While I think it is a good idea to take the vaccine, I think that is a personal decision for individuals,' he said in an interview with conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham.

He then took it a step further during an interview with CNBC host Kelly Evans, telling her; 'I have heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.'

He capped it all off by saying; 'You know, for most of our history they have been voluntary. So I don't think I'm arguing for anything out of the ordinary. ... I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input.'

And while it is true that the decision whether or not take vaccines, which were first created by Louis Pasteur in the late nineteenth century, has long been voluntary, Paul seems to omit that since their introduction people are living longer, mortality rates have decreased drastically, and overall quality of life has, almost universally, improved drastically for people around the globe as a direct result of vaccinations.

What's more, vaccines have managed to eliminate over a dozen infectious diseases in some areas of the world, and in the case of polio, actually eradicate a disease that led to paralysis in millions of Americans.

This is why, politics aside, it seems that those most upset with Christie and Paul are parents, with many labeling their comments as irresponsible when delivered at a time when over 100 cases of measles have been reported in 14 states around the country. 

All of these cases seem to link back to an outbreak that started last December in Disneyland, with officials now believing an American child who had not been vaccinated carried it home from a foreign country.

And while measles is an often painful and uncomfortable viral disease, especially for  young child, with high fevers and a red rash covering the body, it is seldom, if ever, fatal.

That being said, many are concerned as measles is one of the infectious diseases that had been eliminated from this country since 2000, this entirely thanks to a vaccine first being introduced in 1963, which would in 1971 become the MMR vaccine, protecting children from the mumps and rubella as well.

Then, in 1989, a two-part process went into practice during which a child is immunized once as a toddler and again around the age of four or five.

This method has proven to be 99% effective and has resulted in a 75% decrease in measles fatalities in the United States.

Anti-vaccine supporters have a far different opinion of the measles vaccine, believing that it causes autism in children.

This despite the fact that the research paper from which these opinions are derived, which linked autism spectrum disorders to the MMR vaccine was revealed to be 'utterly false' by the editor-in-chief of The Lancet, the medical journal in which it was published. 

Jenny McCarthy, who, alongside MTV reality star turned designer Kristin Cavallari, is the best known member of the group, became a supporter after her son Evan was diagnosed with autism. 

Meanwhile, President Barack Obama, himself a father to two young daughter, showed his support for child vaccinations over the weekend, telling NBC News; 'There is every reason to get vaccinated — there aren’t reasons to not.' 

He closed out be saying; 'You should get your kids vaccinated. It's good for them, but we should be able to get back to the point where measles effectively is not existing in this country.'
