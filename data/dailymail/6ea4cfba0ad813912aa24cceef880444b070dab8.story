Judge Clifford Bellamy said the man's smoking habit was another example of him being unable to give up 'habit-forming behaviour', including 
smoking cannabis and excessive drinking

A man was stopped from adopting his three-year-old grandson after a family court judge said he was concerned about his smoking habit.

Judge Clifford Bellamy said several areas of concern had been raised about the man’s suitability for adopting, including drug use spanning three decades and smoking.

The judge said the grandfather's smoking was 'significant' in the context of 'his ability to give up habit-forming behaviour'.

This included a 30-year cannabis habit and worries over excessive drinking - as well as being unable to quit smoking, even with professional help.

There were also concerns raised over domestic violence and problems with anxiety and depression.

Judge Bellamy, who said no-one in the case could be identified, concluded that the little boy should be placed for adoption.

In a written ruling, released after the family court hearing in Leicester,  Judge Bellamy said Leicestershire County Council had asked him to make an order allowing the young boy to be placed for adoption.

The council, which was named in the ruling, had responsibility for the child.

But the case had come about after the boy’s 17-year-old mother, who was 14 when she gave birth, opposed the council’s application.

She suggested that her father and her father’s partner should care for the young boy, if she were not allowed.

But Judge Bellamy said an assessment of the grandfather’s suitability had raised a 'number of areas of concern'.

This included a history of domestic violence, worries about excessive drinking, problems with anxiety and depression, drug abuse and smoking, the ruling said.

The grandfather had told the court how he had been a smoker for several years and had used cannabis regularly for about 30 years.

He said he had not used cannabis since late 2013 - when he had 'decided' to give up his habit.

But the judge said it was significant that the man had been unable to quit smoking - despite seeking help from a GP.

Judge Bellamy said: '(He) has been a smoker for several years.

boy and asked the judge to make an order so the child could be placed for 
adoption

'Whilst smoking is not necessarily a contra-indicator to (his) suitability as a long-term carer for (his grandson), it is significant in the context of his ability to give up habit-forming behaviour even with professional support.'

He added: '(His) inability to give up his long-term smoking habit even with professional support casts some doubt on the reliability of his assertion that in December 2013 he gave up a 30-year cannabis dependency by sheer force of will-power without any professional support.'

Judge Bellamy said social workers had flagged concerns about the mother’s 'drug abuse' and lifestyle.

He said the evidence raised 'very real doubts' about the capacity of the mother or the grandfather and his partner to care for the little boy.

He added: 'I have come to the conclusion that in this case the evidence points very clearly to placement for adoption.'
