A father stole thousands of pounds of money from his dying son's trust fund - leaving it so bare that not enough was left to pay for his funeral, a court heard.

Julian Emms, 46, set up a charity fund 
for his son Michael who was Britain’s youngest victim of motor neurone 
disease as a teenager.

A court heard many people were touched by his plight - and did sponsored events to raise £55,000 to send brave Michael to China for pioneering stem cell treatment.

But father-of-three Emms is accused of 'stripping' thousands of pounds from the money left in the Michael Emms Trust Fund after the treatment failed.

The court heard he left just £1,300 in the account - not enough to pay for Michael’s funeral when he died last year, aged 24.

Prosecutor Meirion Davies said: 'A lot of work by a lot of good people had helped put money in that fund.

'What sort of man would trick his own son out of that money and use it for his own purposes?

'It was despicable - someone who could do something like that is beneath contempt.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard how Emms tricked Michael’s grandmother Anne Brandon who was one of the four people authorised to sign the charity’s cheques.

Mr Davies said: 'Emms said he was booking a holiday to the USA for Michael and needed two cheques.

'One was for £3,000 for the holiday and the other was £300 for insurance.

'Mrs Brandon wrote the cheques out to a travel agency called Travelcare and signed them - but left them blank because Emms didn’t know the exact amounts.'

But the court heard Emms altered one of the cheques to get his hands on the £16,500.

Problems: The court heard Emms had a £15,000 business debt at the time the cheque was cashed

The jury heard Mrs Brandon and her husband David had 'second thoughts' and asked for the cheques to be returned.

Mr Davies said: 'Emms was upset that they were suspicious but they had every right to be.

'Emms went to their home and burned the cheques in front of them.

'It was theatrical and carefully calculated to hide the fact that one of them was a blank piece of paper.'

The court was told Emms had already cashed one cheque for £16,500 after changing the payee to 'cash'.

Mr Davies said: 'Police searched his home for the money but Emms told them: "It is not here - I spent it".

'He had carried out a cold-blooded and deliberate deception then lied to extricate himself from a deeper and deeper hole.'

The court heard Emms, of Ebbw Vale, South Wales, had a £15,000 business debt at the time the cheque was cashed.

Emms had broken up from his wife Theresa at the time he allegedly stole from the trust fund.

His former mother-in-law Mrs Brandon told how she was 'devastated' when she discovered the money had been taken from her grandson’s account.

She said: 'I went to the bank to check the position of the account and found £16,500 had gone.

'Lots of people had been involved. I was devastated.'

Mrs Brandon said there was not enough money left to pay for Michael’s funeral when he died in April last year.

Emms denies fraud.

The trial continues.
