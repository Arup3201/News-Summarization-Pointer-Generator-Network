A family dog was nearly blinded, its owner has said, by an allergic reaction after it was groomed at a Pets at Home mega-store.

Terry Maughan, 20, from Norton paid £36 for his 20-month-old West Highland terrier Snowbell to have the treatment.

But when he took his beloved pooch home he was shocked to see the dog struggling to breathe and unable to open her eyes.

Builder Terry rushed Snowbell to the vets where they discovered she had suffered an allergic reaction to the shampoo.

'We all thought she was going to die,' Mr Maughan said. 'She could have had a heart attack, it was beating so fast. Her eyes were red and she wouldn't open them and she was drooling a lot.

'Snowbell was walking into things so we thought she could have also gone blind. Everyone was so worried about her, she is part of the family and my brothers and sisters were in tears.

'I think it's disgraceful what happened. You don't expect anything like this to happen to your dog when you put it in the hands of licensed and trained professionals. 

'She's improving now thanks to a course of eye drops they vet gave to her but it's a very slow process. 

'I fear she will have eyesight problems in the future because of this and may go blind.

'My father went to the Pets at Home store to tell them to stop using chemicals because our dog almost died.

When Terry took his dog to the vets its eyes were red and aggravated, it was drooling excessively and had a rapid  heart rate and temperature. The symptoms appeared to have been caused by a grooming seesion

'It took them three days to respond to our complaint and they never even asked us how

Snowbell was or said sorry for what happened. I think it's disgraceful and appalling.'

Snowbell fell ill an hour after having a shampoo, wash and haircut at the Groom Rooms salon based at Pets at Home in Festival Park, Stoke-on-Trent.

The family were landed with a £102 vet's bill. 

 Pets at Home have launched an investigation into the grooming products that were used on Snowbell

'Snowbell was reluctant to open her eyelids, which appeared swollen with yellow purulent discharge coming from both eyes,' Vet Susan Cuthbert at Charter Veterinary Surgery in Newcastle-under-Lyme, said.

She explained that parts of both of the dog's eyes were red and inflamed and the dog was drooling far more than usual.

'It could have been worse had they not brought her in on Sunday. She looked in a bad state and distressed and I'm glad they brought Snowbell to see me. I don't know for certain what caused it, but it could have been a reaction to something,' Ms Cuthbert said. 

Pets at Home have launched an investigation into the products they use on dogs.

A spokesman said: 'Our Groom Room colleagues are all highly trained and use only specifically formulated products which have a history of use in pet grooming.

'When washing dogs, great care is taken to avoid shampoo coming into contact with a dog's eyes.

'This was certainly the case with Snowbell so we were very surprised to learn of her reaction.

'The products used with Snowbell are common to all 179 Groom Rooms around the country and we have seen no other cases of dogs being affected in this way.'

It was not the first time a customer of the grooming service in Stoke-on-Trent had taken their dog home to find it was dangerously unwell, the Stoke Sentinel reported.

Nicki Jones, owner of another West Highland Terrier, says her pet went through a similar experience last year after going to the Pets at Home store.

She had to pay £470 in vets bills for four visits and two eye surgeries after she was told by her vet that her dog could go blind.
