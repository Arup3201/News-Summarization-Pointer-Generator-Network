A 2-year-old Florida boy has died after being attacked by four large Rottweilers at his grandfather's home.

Citrus County Sheriff's Office says it responded to the residence Saturday afternoon and discovered the body of 2-year-old Christopher Joaquin 'Jack' Camejo in the backyard of the home.

Sheriffs say the boy's parents, 29-year-old Christopher Camejo and 31-year-old Claudia Scarbrough, were both inside the residence on West Oak Street in Crystal River at the time, along with friends and two other children.

Four-legged killers: These four Rottweilers invovled in the deadly attack were taken away by animal control officials  and will likely be destroyed 

The mauling took place at this residence on West Oak Street in Crystal River

The toddler, known to his grandfather Joaquin Camejo as 'little man,' was in the care of his mother and his grandfather's girlfriend, Kimberly Fisher.

Speaking to WFLA, Miss Fisher tearfully recounted how just after 4pm Saturday she went to use the restroom when the little boy slipped out of the house and was attacked by his grandfather's Rottweilers.

'Had I not gone to the bathroom, this would've never happened,' she said.

Devastated: Kimberly Fisher says she went to the bathroom for a moment when her boyfriend's grandson, Christopher, slipped out of the house and was attacked 

Spared: Several Rottweiler puppies and a Chihuahua have been left at the Crystal River house

Caged: The animals responsible for the mauling will remain in a shelter pending an investigation 

Fisher noted that the four pets had never shown any aggression towards the children.

Officers responded to the house at around 4.30pm and discovered the boy's lifeless body covered in teeth marks lying in the backyard.

The boy's father was arrested after he was found to be in violation of an unrelated injunction for protection stemming from a domestic violence incident involving his wife of six years.

Animal Control officers also responded and removed four Rottweilers and an additional dog from the home, which were taken to a shelter.

A Chihuahua and several Rottweiler puppies were left at Joaquin Camejo's home.

Family: Mr Camejo and his wife of six years, 31-year-old Claudia Scarbrough (left), have a younger son and an older daughter together

Once the investigation into Chris Camejo's death is complete, the dogs will likely be euthanized.

A relative has started an online fundraiser to help the family with the toddler's final expenses.

The child is survived by his one-year-old brother, Dean, and his 5-year-old sister, Evah.
