A thug walked free from court today - despite admitting punching a female cashier in the face at a bookies after losing a bet worth just £1.30.

John Eamer, 29, flew across the counter at terrified Leanne Vallis and struck her twice after she told him he had lost the 50p wager - before calmly walking away.

The horrifying attack, which left the assistant with bruising and swelling below the eye, was caught on CCTV and he was later captured by police.

Thug: John Eamer, who punched a woman cashier at a bookies, outside Cheltenham Magistrates' Court (left) and at the scene of the crime

This is the barbaric moment John Eamer, from Gloucester, punched a woman cashier in the face after being told he hadn't won his bet

But the serial offender - who 
previously beat up a pensioner just because he sat next to him on a 
bench - was spared jail.

Cheltenham Magistrates' Court handed him a 12-month community order alongside 200 hours of unpaid work.

The court had previously heard that Eamer had put one 50p bet on Germany to beat Portugal in their Euro 2012 clash on June 9.

But the 'handicap' wager, placed at 
Ladbrokes in Gloucester, meant the Germans had to win 2-0 in order for 
him to collect the paltry £1.30 jackpot.

In fact, Germany only beat Portugal 
1-0 in the tournament group game - but Eamer steamed into the bookies at
10.15am the next day, convinced he had won.

The gambler then flipped when Leanne Vallis, the Ladbrokes cashier behind the desk told him he was not a winner.

The attack happened in a branch of Ladbrokes, on Southgate Street in Gloucester

He raged: 'I know what I f****** bet 
on - I know it was a f****** winner', before being ordered out of the 
bookies by the cashier.

Derek Ryder, prosecuting, said: 
'Without warning the defendant leaned over the counter and punched her 
twice in the face - causing her glasses to be knocked off and her body 
to rock backwards.

'Leanne Vallis said she did not even 
see the second blow coming after she asked Mr Eamer to leave once more -
as she did not have time to put her glasses back on.'

The stunned cashier was left with heavy bruising, bleeding and swelling below her eye.

Mr Ryder said: 'In 14 years she said she had never had anything happen to her that upset her and scared her.

'She said it seemed ridiculous over such a small bet.'

Carole Malvern-White, defending Eamer,
said her client was convinced he had won the bet and was relying on the
money he had won for food.

She added that he now showed a significant degree of remorse and regretted what he had done.

'In 14 years she said she had never had anything happen to her that upset her and scared her. She said it seemed ridiculous over such a small bet.'

Derek Ryder, prosecuting

She told the court: 'This was an act 
out of complete frustration, he believed he had a winning bet. He was 
full or paranoia and felt that at that moment in time the cashier was 
deceiving him.

'He has expressed a significant degree
of remorse and very much regrets the way he dealt with her, he has even
offered to write her a letter expressing this.

'He struggles with drugs and he had 
very little by the way of funds and was relying on the money he thought 
he had won to last him until he got his next benefit.'

Magistrates adjourned the case for a pre-sentence report last week.

He was sentenced him to a 12-month community order, with a six month drug rehabilitation requirement and 200 hours unpaid work.

Chair of the bench Nicholas Negus told him: 'You will no doubt be pleased to know we are not sending you into custody.

'We are more or less following the recommendations of the probation service and giving you a community order.'

Eamer, from Cromwell Street in 
Gloucester - where murderer Fred West lived - was also ordered to pay 
Leanne Vallis £150 in compensation alongside £50 in court costs.

After the attack a spokesman for 
Ladbrokes said: 'Incidents like this are always distressing for those 
involved but we have excellent security procedures.

'We also have the best CCTV in the business.'

Eamer was previously jailed for 15 
months in 2008 after launching an unprovoked attack on a pensioner - 
just because he sat next to him on a bench.

He pushed 67-year-old Michael Hannis 
off the bench - sending him sprawling to the floor - before punching him
in the face as he got to his feet.

Shocked passers-by called an ambulance
for Mr Hannis and as he was being taken to hospital a woman security 
guard became Eamer's next victim.

When she asked to have a word with him he punched her face - knocking her to the ground.

Two other people were also caught in Eamer's inexplicable violent outburst before he was overpowered and arrested.

He later pleaded guilty to assaulting 
all four people. Eamer also forged his friend's cheques back in 2004 - 
while his pal was in hospital.

Magistrates ordered the defendant to pay £79.67 compensation to the Abbey National and £43 costs after he admitted forgery.
