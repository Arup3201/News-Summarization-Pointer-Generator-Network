Where would you find a forgotten husband, a prosthetic hand and a pug dog called Dancer?

Not to mention a Coutts cheque book, keys to a brand new BMW X6 and a love letter written 40 years ago.

The answer is: at  Travelodge's Lost & Found office.

A prosthetic hand and a Sta Wars Stormtrooper outfit were two of the more interesting discoveries left behind by Travelodge customers

One customer left keys to a brand new BMW X6 - hopefully they came forward to claim their property

The hotel chain has revealed some of the interesting items left behind in its 500 properties across the country during the last 12 months.

Some of the unusual items left behind include a Krypton Digital Storm gaming laptop worth £3,000, a suitcase full of pound coins to the value of £3,000 and a 3ft tall yellow duck.

At the Heathrow Terminal 5 hotel, there must have been one very frustrated passenger when they realised they had left behind a one-way, first class ticket to LA.

Another guest managed to leave behind a Feng Shui fish tank he carried everywhere with his for good luck and had to drive 300 miles back to the property to pick it up.
