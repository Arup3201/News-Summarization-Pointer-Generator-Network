Love birds, beware: One Ohio county is planning to spike bird seed with birth control in hopes of keeping pigeons from despoiling the renovated exterior of its 19th-century courthouse.

Wayne County is spending millions to renovate a courthouse built in 1878 in downtown Wooster.

But the county has long had a problem with pigeon droppings on metal statues and other ornamental elements atop the courthouse.

Wayne County in Ohio is spending millions to renovate a courthouse built in 1878 in downtown Wooster - but have a rampant pigeon problem. Authorities hope birth control in the bird feed will help curb the population

The wire mesh used to keep the birds away will be removed during the renovation.

A county commissioner said there are plans to put birth control chemicals specific to pigeons in bird seed to help control the population. 

Officials hope it will cut the flock in half with just one application. 

There have been complaints about the millions of dollars being poured into the repairs.

But in response, according to the Wooster Daily Record, Commissioner Ann Obrecht said: 'This project is not a cosmetic fix. It is a structural repair. 

'Once these structural repairs are done, the exterior should be good for the next 100 years.'

The slate roof on the building is also going to be repaired after 137 years.
