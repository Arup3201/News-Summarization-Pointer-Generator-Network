Police were given a freebee when a man wanted on several felony counts and known as a ‘scourge to society’ crashed into another man wanted for violating his probation.

The man, 31-year-old Ramel Rodriguez, was fleeing police in a stolen 1991 Honda Accord when he ran a red light and crashed into a red Volkswagen Jetta.

In it was 31-year-old Steven Broyles, who is wanted on two felony counts. Both men were arrested at the scene.

Police first spotted Rodriguez in the passenger’s seat of the Accord last Sunday, and immediately identified him, as he is notorious within the small town of Hermiston, Oregon.

Officers knew he was wanted for questioning regarding the stolen vehicle, and he was identified as a suspect for a robbery the night before.

According to Acting Police Chief Jason Edmiston, Rodriguez slid into the driver’s seat after the car pulled over to the side of the road, and took off.

After leading officers on a three-block chase, Rodriguez ran a red light, slamming into a 1999 Volkswagen Jetta in the intersection, the Tri-City Herald reports.

The driver of the Jetta turned out to be Broyles, who was wanted on two felony probation violation warrants.

He was also cited for driving uninsured and whilst suspended.

Broyles’ passenger, 27-year-old Robert Swales, was treated for minor injuries at a nearby hospital.

He was cited for possession of drug paraphernalia, the Hermiston Herald reports.

Rodriguez was slapped with a litany of charges - 19 in all - including four counts of robbery, one count of both burglary and assault, and four counts of pointing a firearm at another person.

For the incident alone, he was charged with two outstanding felony warrants, one felony for causing his passenger injury, alluding police in a vehicle and by foot, unlawful possession of a firearm, and reckless endangerment.

Mr Edmiston said they were thrilled to get Rodriguez off the streets.

He said in a statement: ‘Mr Rodriguez is clearly a scourge to society.

'We are very fortunate nobody was seriously injured based on the numerous poor decisions made by Mr Rodriguez.’
