A mysterious plane has reportedly been raided for drugs by police at an Illawarra regional airport after flying from the US via the Marshall Islands, Guam and the Philippines.

The search of the Swearingen Merlin 3 twin-turbo prop plane at Albion Park, south of Wollongong, started on Tuesday even though it arrived at the airport almost two weeks ago.

The Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad carried out the raid with help from local police.

Police continue to go over a US-registered Swearingen Merlin 3 twin-turbo prop plane at the Illawarra Airport, Albion Park on Thursday

A spokesman for the State Crime Command said the operation was part of an active investigation and refused to provide further comment.

Acting Inspector Matthew Glasgow from Albion Park police told Daily Mail Australia local police assisted with the initial search of the plane but had 'nothing more to do with it'.

It is reported that 35kg of drugs were seized from the aircraft and a man was taken into custody in relation to the incident, but police would not confirm this.

Flight records show the 43-year-old plane is owned by a US-registered company called the Oregonian Aero Club and since April it has flown through Florida in the US via Alaska, Missouri, Texas, California, Washington and Hawaii, the Illawarra Mercury reported.

The plane left Hawaii on May 2 to fly to Marshall Islands, roughly halfway to Queensland. It then flew northeast to the US territory of Guam, which is 2000km east of the Philippines.

On May 5 it arrived in Angeles City, near Manila in the Philippines – the last place it is known to have been before arriving in Australia.

It did not show up on control tower records until June 27 when it left Coffs Harbour airport to travel to Albion Park.

The Oregonian Aero Club was incorporated in Wilmington, Delaware – where tax on planes can be limited because aircrafts are able to be registered to a trustee corporation rather than a person.
