This is the moment that a Chinese man set up his own mini-kitchen in an airport departure lounge after missing his flight.

Wu Jiayong, 46, became an internet hit after he produced the electric rice cooker from his luggage and made his own lunch in the middle of Hong Kong's busy International Airport.

The 46-year-old was caught on camera collecting water from the airport's bathroom before plugging the rice cooker into one of the lounge's empty sockets, according to The People's Daily.

The construction worker was flying home to Shandong, China, after losing his job in Singapore when he fell asleep and missed his connecting flight. 

'I had just enough to get a new ticket set to leave on Tuesday two days later, but I didn't have any more money for food,' he said.

'I didn't want to offend anyone but I needed power supply to cook the rice so I had to do it indoors.'

Eyewitnesses described the rice cooker as being 'hard to miss' with steam coming from it for over half an hour.

After missing his flight the construction worker was left with no money for food and decided to make his own meals

Mr Jiayong's mini kitchen was soon closed down by airport officials, but fellow travellers and stores within the terminal  helped him with food until he was able to fly home yesterday.

He had been forced to travel to Singapore for work to help look after his family and used the rice cooker for preparing meals during his month long employment.

Mr Jiayong was soon stopped from tapping into the airports electricity supply, but fellow travellers and terminal stores kept him fed after learning of his plight
