Farming leaders last night accused the Government of failing to fulfil its own rhetoric, after the Environment Secretary urged shoppers to buy more British food.

Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers’ Union, said Owen Paterson should be pushing hospitals and schools to buy UK food rather than simply going to the cheapest source.

‘If Owen Paterson is going to get the public to buy British then he should  also get the Government to buy British,’ said Mr Kendall.

‘We had an event at the House of Commons in May last year and they  could not come up with an entirely British menu for us.’

Mr Kendall was speaking at the Oxford Farming Conference yesterday, after Mr Paterson made an impassioned plea calling for a quarter of imported food to be produced in Britain instead.

The farming leader added: ‘The message that people should be buying less imported food is great – but it needs to be followed up.

‘British farmers are leading the way by raising standards and producing high-quality food, but those in the public sector need to play their part by making sure they are looking for local quality and not just the cheapest food.’

Mr Paterson agreed more needed to be done to get the public sector to buy British. He told the conference he had appointed Sir Peter Bonfield, an experienced retail leader, to lead a new drive on the public procurement of food.

He added: ‘The public sector bought £2.1billion worth of food and drink last year. That’s an astonishing amount of money.

'The public sector should be taking advantage of our top quality products, supporting our world-class farmers.’

He said hospitals and schools should be following the example set by the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in Cheshire, which manages to source 92 per cent of its food in the UK.

He added that responsibility should also be taken by shoppers to buy home-grown food that is in season.

He told the conference: ‘By buying seasonal fruit and veg we can improve the nation’s health, help the environment and boost the economy.’

The Countryside Alliance echoed the NFU’s criticism, and urged the Government to  follow its rhetoric with actions.

Sarah Lee, head of policy at the alliance, said: ‘It’s easy to say, “buy British”…but the Government should lead by example.’

Supermarkets said they were using new technology to extend the British growing seasons, making it easier to buy UK food.

Mr Paterson acknowledged that complex labelling rules could confuse consumers.

Much food labelled as British has been grown or raised elsewhere and then brought into the country for processing.
