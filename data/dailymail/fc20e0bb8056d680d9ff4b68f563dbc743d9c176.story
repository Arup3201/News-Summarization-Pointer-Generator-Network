Paul Scholes has described Yaya Toure’s recent tantrum over his birthday cake as 'embarrassing’ and said that the Manchester City midfielder 'just needs a cuddle'.

Toure says he felt under-appreciated after he claims the club forgot to wish him happy birthday after he turned 31 earlier this month.

And former United man Scholes is far from impressed with the Ivorian's behaviour and says nothing like that would ever have happened during days at Old Trafford.

Embarrassing: Paul Scholes says no Manchester United player would ever have behaved the way Toure did

Writing in his Paddy Power blog, he said: 'As for Yaya Toure sulking because Manchester City forgot his birthday, it was comical. Quite embarrassing, really. I can’t remember Man United players storming out over cake.

'We still came back for pre-season. Poor Yaya, maybe the big lad just needs a cuddle.’

Scholes, meanwhile, has been in the Far East with some of his former United team-mates, but was still able to catch the Champions League final.

Heading east: Scholes has just returned from Indonesia where he played a charity match with other ex-United players including Ronny Johnsen, Louis Saha, Dwight Yorke, Raimond van der Gouw and Jesper Blomqvist

Although he was not too impressed with Ronaldo topless goal celebration when he netted the fourth goal in Real Madrid's 4-1 extra time win over Atletico Madrid.

He added: 'I was playing football in Indonesia for a few days with some former Man United team-mates. It’s always nice to catch up with the lads, but the things you miss when you’re away.

'Bloody hell, Ronaldo looks well. He must be getting his body ready for the beach. Not for me that style of celebration. You don’t want to see my Salford tan.'
