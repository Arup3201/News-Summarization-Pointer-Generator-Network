Valencia want Manchester City midfielder Bruno Zuculini on loan.

The 21-year-old signed last month for £3million from Racing Club and marked his debut by scoring against Sporting Kansas City in midweek.

He was wanted on loan by Malaga as part of the deal that brought Willy Caballero to City while Deportivo La Coruna enquired this week.

Perfect start: Bruno Zuculini scored on his debut for Manchester City

Promise: Bruno Zuculini only signed for Manchester City last month but could return to Spain on loan already

City have already added Porto midfielder Fernando to their ranks this season so may be tempted to allow the youngster to leave.

Meanwhile, the club are still waiting to complete the £32m signing of Eliaquim Mangala from the Portuguese side.

The French international was caught on camera discussing a move to the Premier League champions, but sources have described it as a ‘complicated’ deal.
