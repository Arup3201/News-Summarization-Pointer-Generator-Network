A grammar school pupil feared to have joined jihadis in Syria gave his parents the slip to cross the border while on holiday in Turkey, it can be revealed.

Shabazz Suleman, 18, a pupil at the Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe – alma mater of Justice Secretary Chris Grayling – had a place lined up at a leading university after achieving good A-level results this summer.

Suleman, nicknamed ‘Bazz’ by friends, had previously travelled to the Syrian border with an aid convoy last summer.

Counter-terrorism officers – who were alerted by Suleman’s distraught parents – are investigating whether the teenager has gone to the region to join IS or groups affiliated with it.

Police have accessed computer files at the school relating to Suleman. Authorities are also monitoring social media.

A former pupil says Suleman sent him a private message via the Twitter account @KavkazIslamist, writing: ‘I’m in Syria LOL [laugh out loud]. Doing aid work.’

On the same account, Suleman appeared to express support for violence to establish an Islamic state.

He wrote on September 6: ‘Almost all Muslim rulers, when starting a new empire/caliphate, first fought the apostates and then moved on to non-Muslims.’

The Mail on Sunday has also learned Suleman went to the Muslim Education Centre in High Wycombe, where one of the British men convicted in the 2006 transatlantic liquid bomb plot also attended. It is around the corner from the teenager’s £400,000 detached family home.

When approached by this newspaper, Suleman’s mother claimed her son was doing aid work. The Muslim Education Centre said it was shocked by Suleman’s departure and condemned the activities of IS.
