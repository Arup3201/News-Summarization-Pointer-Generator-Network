Roy Hodgson claimed his young England team came of age after Danny Welbeck’s stunning double against Switzerland took the pressure off the head coach.

England opened their Euro 2016 qualification campaign with a 2-0 victory in Basle to give Hodgson a major lift after last summer’s disastrous World Cup.

He said: ‘We had an unfortunate time in Brazil which was a kick in the teeth. Now we can pick up our teeth, put them in and we go again.

‘The players took enormous responsibility. We’ve been pushing that for a while now, about ownership and them making certain it’s not just listening and following instructions, but understanding them and believing and knowing they can do it.

‘We did that from the first minute. This was always going to be a difficult game because Switzerland don’t lose at home. The last time was when England beat them.

'We missed some chances early on but, when Dany eventually scored, it was going to open up on the counter-attack. We can do that with the youth and energy of the team, and that showed to good effect.

‘These are our talented players. This is the way forward. We’ve got to back them.

‘I’m pleased we adopted a bold approach, asked a lot of these players, but only because if it’s going to work in the future, if this group of players is to become any good, we’ve got to do it from the start.

‘We had to go from the start as we mean to continue, and luckily we got the start which will help us.’

Welbeck scored opened the scoring after 58 minutes with a well-taken finished and close the game out with a second in injury time at St Jakob-Park.

Hodgson added: ‘I speak to him often and often I’ve heard him say – I’ve asked him what his best position is – centre-forward, but he understands fully that position wasn’t available to him in the past in an England shirt.

‘Others have got in the team before him. He’s understood the need to do the job elsewhere. We changed the formation towards the end of the game and he was pushed wide and Raheem on the other side.

'He’s never complained. He’s always said he’d play where I wanted him to play, but I’ve never been left in doubt that he wanted to play centrally.’

Hodgson changed his formation following the poor performance at Wembley against Norway at last Wednesday.

Raheem Sterling was outstanding playing just off England’s two main strikers. Joe Hart was also exceptional in goal.

Hodgson added: ‘We thought about the formation at the start of the week but decided against Norway to start in another way.

‘The performance against Norway, especially the latter part – we had a period of flux where we didn’t play too well for 15-20 minutes – and we were pleased when Raheem moved into the middle and Danny went up front.’
