Andy Gray is at the centre of another sexism storm after video footage emerged of him aiming inappropriate comments at Sky Sports reporter Clare Tomlinson.

The former Everton and Scotland striker, who made his return to British television after a three-year absence last weekend as pundit for BT Sport in their FA Cup fourth-round coverage, is facing more embarrassment along with his former Sky colleague Richard Keys.

In the 30-second clip, from their time as Sky presenters, Gray and Keys are heard wolf-whistling at Tomlinson as she prepares to report to camera pitchside, before breaking into a chant of ‘Get your t**s out for the lads’. Gray then makes one final distasteful comment before the footage cuts off.

Long serving: Andy Gray (left) and Richard Keys worked together for Sky Sports from 1992 to 2011

Inappropriate: Clare Tomlinson was about to appear on camera when the pair spoke to her

Wrong: Keys and Gray were caught singing: 'Get your t**s out for the lads'

BT Sport: Andy Gray made a comeback on television for Everton's FA Cup game against Stevenage

Gray was sacked by Sky in January 2011
 after he and Keys were heard on air making derogatory remarks about 
female assistant referee Sian Massey prior to a Premier League 
match between Wolves and Liverpool.

Believing
 their microphones were off, Gray said: ‘Can you believe that? A female 
linesman. Women don’t know the offside rule.’

Keys replied: ‘Course they
 don’t.’ Both were banned before further footage emerged of Gray making 
an  inappropriate comment to Sky Sports presenter Charlotte Jackson off
 air at the Sky studios.

Gray’s
 contract was immediately terminated by Sky Sports' managing director 
Barney Francis for unacceptable behaviour, while Keys resigned soon 
after.

Controversial: Gray was caught on tape with Sky Sports colleague Andy Burton discussing female official Sian Massey before a match at Molineux

Camera rolling: Gray and Sky Sports reporter Burton discussed Massey's appearance

Scandal: The clip was one of a number to emerge in the run-up to Keys and Gray leaving Sky

Poor form: The footage of Gray and Burton made for awkward viewing

More videos were 
leaked around the time of the Massey incident, including one of Keys and
 Gray  giggling while watching highlights of the 1998 Women’s FA Cup 
final.

Both were later 
involved in a stage show called Smash It!, designed for the corporate 
hospitality circuit. The title of the show came from sexual remarks that
 Keys had made in another leaked Sky video.

After
 a brief absence, the pair re-appeared as joint hosts of a talk show on
 radio station talkSPORT, before continuing their TV careers with Al 
Jazeera’s beIN Sports in the Middle East.

Target: Official Sian Massey was the woman that Gray had aimed his insults at

A
 source confirmed the Tomlinson video is genuine and it is 
believed to have come from a Sky outside broadcast from the Millennium 
Stadium in Cardiff in ‘the early 2000s’. Sky are unlikely to take the 
matter further because both men have since left the company.

Gray,
 58, will see the leak of this new video as a deliberate attempt to 
sabotage his bid to make a return to TV screens in this country.

Although
 his appearance on BT Sport was promoted as a one-off, the broadcaster 
have yet to decide if they will use him again, despite a public approval
 rating of 85 per cent on Twitter for his contribution to last 
Saturday’s Stevenage v  Everton FA Cup clash.

Inexcusable: Gray made a lewd suggestion to Charlotte Jackson as they prepared for a Sky Sports show
