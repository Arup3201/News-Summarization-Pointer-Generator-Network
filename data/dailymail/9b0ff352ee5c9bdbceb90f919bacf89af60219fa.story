Taron Stead, 17, was cycling to work when he was hit by a car in Sheffield. The driver got out but told him she would be late so left him at side of the road

A mother who hit a teenage cyclist in her car while on the school run refused to help him because she 'didn't want her children to be late'.

Taron Stead, 17, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was cycling to work in early morning rush hour traffic when he was hit by a silver car and knocked off his brand new mountain bike.

The woman then got out of the car and reportedly told him her children were inside and would be upset by the blood, before driving off without exchanging details.

The IT apprentice was left at the side of the road  with cuts and bruises to his hands and face and was cared for by staff from nearby Sheffield University until paramedics arrived.

His furious mother, Naomi Pickard, 45, has released a photograph of his injuries in that hope that it will encourage witnesses to come forward.

She told the Sheffield Star: 'Taron said the woman in the car got out looked over at him, told him she had children in the car who were upset and she didn't want them to be late for school, then the car drove off. 

'I can't believe anyone would leave an injured child at the side of the road after a crash, but it was rush hour and it would have been busy so I am hoping that witnesses come forward and help the police trace the driver.

'Fortunately he was wearing a helmet, or I dread to think what might have happened.'

The teenager had only bought the bike three weeks ago with money from his first apprenticeship wage. 

A nearby Halfords store has since offered to repair his bike free of charge after hearing about the accident. 

A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said: 'On Friday, March 6, it is reported that a cyclist was travelling towards Brook Hill, along Crookes Valley Road, onto Winter Street

He was hit at the junction of Mushroom Lane in Sheffield and Crookes Valley Road (pictured) and left at the side of the road covered in blood. Staff from the nearby university stayed with him until paramedics arrived

'At about 8.30am, the cyclist and a vehicle turning onto Mushroom Lane were in collision. The cyclist suffered facial injuries and bruising.

'It is reported that the vehicle left the scene. The vehicle is described as a silver Ford, either a Focus or Mondeo.'

Anyone with information is asked to call South Yorkshire Police on 101.
