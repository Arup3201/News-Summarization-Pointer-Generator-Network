Mike Ashley was left red-faced after Newcastle bags sold by his Sports Direct company came attached with 'Fulham' branded zip fasteners.

The £9 rucksacks feature Newcastle's name and badge across the back but closer inspection reveals the name of their former Premier League rivals on tags attached to the zippers.

According to The Sun, two young Toon fans were so disappointed by the manufacturing mess up that they refused to take their new bags to school.

Boone was told she could not return the bags to her nearest store but must send them back by post - before the company apologised for the mistake and offered replacements.
