The incredible moment an Idaho mother was struck by lightning was recorded on video by her daughter who was standing just feet away.

On Tuesday night severe weather gripped the town of Hayden and Stephanie Rey and her daughter CC Weske ventured outside to watch the lightning storm unfold.

At dusk, as dusk rolled in, Weske was filming a 10 second Snap Chat of her mother while lying on the ground and caught the flash of lightning strike her mother, making her glow like a nightlight in the darkness.

'I was like, 'Oh something is about to happen,' that's why I was filming it,' Weske said to KXLY. 'Then just all of the sudden, it just literally everything lit up and it sounded like a gun went off.'

'I screamed my phone flew out of my hand and I really wasn't sure what happened,' Rey said. 'I was like f**K, I think I just got hit by lightning and so we just took off running.'

Mom, Stephanie said that she tingled all over for several hours after the strike and happy she has lived to tell the story of her brush with death.

'Very, very thankful,' Rey said to KXLY. 'Even though we are joking about it and funny or what ever but very creepy.'

CC Weske posted on Facebook her thoughts on the close call too.

'So you know how some people say that they're the luckiest person on the planet?' wrote CC.

'Well.. I do believe that my mother and I can now take that title.

'Being about a foot from being struck by lightning, and my mom getting her phone thrown from her hand by lightning, and us both going deaf for about a minute.'
