Two girls found murdered in Pennsylvania nearly five decades ago and buried in a potter's grave have finally been identified as two teenagers who vanished from their home in Philadelphia.

Sandra Stiver, then 14, and her sister-in-law Martha, then 17, disappeared in early 1968 and relatives speculated that they had headed to Kansas City, where the family had previously lived.

In August 1968, one body was found shot five times and dumped off Route 82 in Berks County, while the second was found about four miles away in French Creek State Park in April 1969. The second body was skeletal but authorities believed she had been murdered around the same time as the first.

The girls, who authorities deduced were related because of their similar clothing, could not be identified and were buried in a potter's grave in Berks County. But their family never stopped looking.

Found: The bodies of Sandy Stiver (left), who was just 14 when she vanished, and Martha Stiver (right), have been identified as two girls buried in a potter's grave in Pennsylvania. They vanished from their home in 1968

They were finally identified after one of the Stivers' family members 
read about the case on the National Missing and Unidentified Persons web database, and thought the timings matched up.

They contacted authorities and offered DNA samples to be tested against the bodies, which were exhumed from Potter's Field. The DNA samples matched up.

'We've been praying and praying for this day for so many years,' Sandra's sister Hazel Stiver-DeMoss told the Philadelphia Daily News from her home in Richfield, Ohio.

'But we still don't know who did this, who killed them.'

Authorities are now appealing for any information that can help identify their killer.

Ahead of the girls' disappearance, the Stiver family had lived in Kansas City and there was speculation after they vanished that the girls may have headed back there.

When they moved, Martha - who was married to one of the Stiver's sons - had left her one-year-old daughter behind with family members, and some guessed the girls had headed back to get her.

Similarities: The girls' bodies were found eight months apart but both were wearing these identical sandals

'My dad always 
believed in his heart that she talked my sister into running away to get
 that baby,' Hazel said. 'The last thing anyone remembered was that they
 went to the corner store and didn't come back.'

The Reading Eagle reported that it was
 believed the girls traveled to Reading and possibly worked at the 
Reading Fair in the summer of 1968.

Sandy Stiver's body was found on August 22 and had been shot five times in the abdomen and torso and once in the temple. She was wearing a medal reading: 'I am a Catholic. In case of emergency, call me a priest.'

Eight months later, her sister-in-law's body was found on a flat rock in the state park, but authorities deduced that she had also been killed in August.

She was naked and had three teeth 
missing, and her sandal and panties were found nearby. Police believed 
she was related to the first girl who had been found.

'They were believed to be related, or 
knew each other, by the clothing that they had,' Berks County Coroner Dennis Hess told Philly.com.

Killed: Sandy, whose body had been shot five times in the torso and abdomen and once in the temple, was wearing this bronze medal, which said: 'I am a Catholic.  In case of emergency, call me a priest'

'In particular, there were a pair of Italian-made sandals that 
were identical. State police were able to determine that they were the 
same shoes.'

The girls could not be identified and their bodies were buried in a potter's grave - a grave used for the unidentified or people who cannot afford a proper burial.

The following August, police thought 
they had made a break in the case when they came across photographs in a
 hanger that had been used by a biker gang. The images showed two girls 
that police speculated could have been the Stivers - but this was never 
confirmed.

At the request of the family, the bodies were exhumed and samples were sent for DNA testing.

Sandra's
 father died of cancer in 1974, never finding out what happened to his 
daughter or daughter-in-law. Her mother is in poor health in Ohio, the 
Daily News reported.

Who are they? Months after the bodies were found, 
police found pictures of these girls in a hangar that was used by a 
biker gang. Police thought they might be the girls who were killed - but
 this was never confirmed

The Stiver family now plan to drive to 
Pennsylvania and collect Sandy's remains, while Martha's daughter, 
Samantha, will decide what to do with her mother's remains.

Now authorities are searching for suspects in the case. Anyone with information about the deaths is  urged to contact the State Police in Reading at 610-378-4011.

'The University of North Texas tells us this is the oldest case that they have ever been able to match, from 1968 and 1969,' Hess added. 'They’ve never done one this old. That, in itself, is a feat.'
