Beneath the news anchor's poise and groomed appearance, CNN host Zain Verjee has been hiding a painful secret.

Since childhood, the Kenyan-Canadian presenter has battled the debilitating skin condition psoriasis.

Miss Verjee, who is host of CNN's European daytime program, told her story today in the hope of bringing attention to a condition which often leaves a sufferer with agonizing sores and living as a virtual recluse.

Zain Verjee, co-anchor at CNN International, has revealed her battle with psoriasis

In an essay for CNN, Ms Verjee, 39, explains how psoriasis ravaged her entire body from the neck down from a young age.

She wrote: 'I have fish-like scales. There are tiny 
red islands floating on the surface of my skin. They combine to create 
continents with jagged surfaces.

'They turn black and start to smell. 
There is blood and pus.

'I suffer from psoriasis. It's ravaged my body since I was 8. At its worst my plaques look like leprosy. I feel like a leper.'

Miss Verjee described in the essay how she was once asked to leave a pool when she was 22 by another swimmer because of her skin condition.

She explains that it has affected the clothes that she chooses to wear and where she will sit in a restaurant. Winter is her favorite time of year because she can cover up.

In her teens, the presenter refused to date and shrank from making friends, living out life in her imagination.

Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin to develop.

These patches are normally on the elbows, knees, scalp and lower back but they can appear anywhere on the body.

Most people only have small patches but in some cases it can be much more severe.

The patches can be very itchy and sore.

Psoriasis affects 7.5million Americans and it most often develops in adults under the age of 35.

It is a chronic condition which usually involves periods with few symptoms followed by periods with more severe symptoms.

It occurs when the body produces too many skin cells which results in a build up.

It is thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system, it is also thought to have a genetic element. It is not contagious.

There is no cure but it can often be treated effectively with creams, light therapy or injections.

Miss Verjee explained that her role as a news broadcaster brings her confidence but that at the heart of it all, her mother has been her saving grace.

She wrote: 'I fight my body and myself all my life. I
 hit rock bottom many times because of my disease. It seems futile to 
try anymore.

''Who will ever want me like this" I cry hysterically at 
home. "No one could ever touch me." My mother pulls me out self-loathing
 and defeatism. When I want to give up, she will not let me.'

By her early twenties, the confidence that her mother instills in her and the mind she has cultivated in the years spent battling her physical appearance propel Miss Verjee to a starring role on a Kenyan prime time show.

She describes that how during her first TV appearance, she coated her legs in Vaseline and wrapped them in plastic film to ease the pain and contain the smell of her sores.

Miss Verjee's mother spent years researching treatments for psoriasis from Dead Sea salts to acupuncture and hypnosis.

But finally it is a friend of her mother's who provides salvation.

The presenter is convinced by her mother to attend a small clinic for severe skin diseases in the town of George, South Africa.

She was ordered to eat simply banning shellfish, meat, spices, tomatoes and many, many other foods from her diet.

Miss Verjee began eating yogurt or bran for breakfast, salads or fish for lunch and chicken for dinner while drinking herbal tea and water. She remembered: 'Nothing tastes good. I yearn for Tabasco.'

With the help of meditation, visualization and a strict, simple diet, Miss Verjee experiences a tiny breakthrough in her condition. And then another. And another.

She writes: 'I watch with fascination
 the metamorphosis of my skin. The continents on my body move apart with
 the seismic change in my mind. The scales no longer build. Then they 
are gone. I can't believe it.'

Miss
 Verjee was in remission from psoriasis for a decade between the ages of 24 and 34 which she 
puts down to maintaining a strict diet, her state of mind and the 
support of family and friends. 

As
 her condition receded, the news presenter's career went from strength 
to strength. She left Kenya for a role in DC on The Situation Room with 
Wolf Blitzer before transferring to CNN's London bureau.

Her psoriasis has since returned and the broadcaster's fight against the condition has begun again.

Following the publication of her article, support has poured in for the presenter along with many psoriasis sufferers sharing their stories and how they cope with the condition. 

Ms Verjee tweeted: 'I'm moved by all the responses to this. Thank you so much.'
