Police in Manchester stopped a motorist who was about to remove a wheel clamp from his car using a petrol-powered saw. 

Officers on patrol in the Deansgate area of the city noticed the man with the powerful cutting tool at 11.45pm on Monday. 

The blue BMW 3-series was immobilised by the DVLA because it was understood to be untaxed.

According to Greater Manchester Police no arrests were made at the scene because officers intervened before any damage was inflicted on the clamp. 

It is understood that the motorist had a two-stroke petrol-powered Stihl saw with a metal cutting disc.  

The DVLA has the power to immediately clamp or impound any car if it is not properly taxed. Car owners can notify authorities if they are not using the car and sign statutory declaration that the car is off the road. 

However, if they sign the declaration and continue to use the car, it can be seized.

Motorists who have been clamped by the DVLA have to provide evidence that they have taxed their car before it can be released. 

If a car has not been taxed, the motorist will have to pay a 'surety' deposit of £700 to have it released. 

According to the DVLA the cost of having a clamp removed increases the longer the car is immobilised. 

If a driver refuses to pay, the DVLA will destroy or sell the car to recoup some of the costs.  

The DVLA clamped a number of cars following an inspection in Manchester City Centre last night
