Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, pictured arriving for an earlier court hearing at Brighton Magistrates' in March. She has now been cleared of two charges relating to the anti-fracking protests outside energy firm Cuadrilla's exploratory oil drilling site on the outskirts of Balcombe on August 19 2013

Britain’s only Green MP has vowed to continue her fight to end fracking after being cleared of obstructing a public highway and a public order offence during high-profile protests.

The Brighton Pavilion MP was arrested outside energy company Cuadrilla’s exploratory oil drilling site in Balcombe, West Sussex, last August 19.

She was among a group of protesters who had linked arms outside the site, which had become a national focal point for anti-fracking protests.

During the trial at Brighton Magistrates’ Court alongside four co-defendants, Lucas, 53, said she 'wanted to express solidarity' by protesting peacefully.

She was found not guilty of the two charges she faced - willful obstruction of a public highway and breaching an order under Section 14 of the Public Order Act.

Outside court, she said: 'We are pleased that the court upheld our right to peacefully protest against fracking, but this judgment is not a victory or cause for celebration.

'We will continue to campaign to end fracking and only celebrate when our world is on the path to a clean energy future.'

Ms Lucas’s co-defendants - Josef Dobraszczyk, 22, from Bristol; Ruth Jarman, 50, from Hook, Hampshire; Sheila Menon, 42, from north east London; and Ruth Potts, 39, from Totnes, Devon - were also cleared of both charges.

Ms Lucas told the trial she felt it was important to protest about fracking in a bid to prevent the UK being locked into using more fossil fuels.

She said:'I’m haunted by the idea that my children and my children’s children will turn round to me and say, "What did you do about this overwhelming threat?"

Caroline Lucas was arrested on the same day that activists linked arms to resist police officers as they cleared the road outside the main entrance to the Cuadrilla exploratory drilling site in Balcombe, West Sussex. It came as part of  anti fracking demonstrations which inclided two days of 'mass civil disobedience'

'And I want to do all I can do peacefully to address that before it’s too late.'

Ms Lucas told the trial that governments were failing to urgently address the issues surrounding climate change.

And she said she felt the protest outside Cuadrilla’s main entrance was a 'legitimate' and 'appropriate' way of sending a message to the Government about fracking concerns.

Although Cuadrilla did not frack at the site, its drilling operation sparked concerns that it would go on to do so in the future.

Prosecutor Jonathan Edwards told the trial that a large camp formed near the site’s entrance and extra officers were drafted in because of the vast number of protesters.

A notice under Section 14 of the Public Order Act was imposed, requiring demonstrators to use a designated protest area away from Cuadrilla’s entrance.

Ms Lucas told the trial it felt important and 'symbolic' to be based outside the main gate during the protest, which lasted about five hours from around 10.15am.

Giving evidence, she denied being told of a designated protest area by police, adding: 'I couldn’t see any reason why we couldn’t continue our peaceful protest.'

PC Robert Staplehurst, of Sussex Police, told the court he approached Ms Lucas, said there was a Section 14 notice and asked whether there was anything he could say to move her.

Ms Lucas - who was elected as the Green Party’s first MP in the 2010 general election - replied no and was arrested.

She went on: 'If we had another 10 to 15 minutes we could have come to an agreement to end it and dispersed. We weren’t doing anything different than we were in the previous five hours.'

Explaining
 how he reached his verdicts, district judge Tim Pattinson said the 
prosecution had failed to satisfy him that Ms Lucas had 'the requisite 
knowledge' about the Section 14 order being in place.

'All
 the defendants said that they would have moved if it had been necessary
 to permit access to emergency vehicles. None of these defendants was 
‘locked on’ to each other or to any object.'

Environmental activists locked themselves together at the main entrance to the Cuadrilla exploratory drilling site as part of the demonstrations in August

Hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves high pressure liquid being pumped deep underground to split shale rock and release oil or gas supplies.

Fears have been raised over the potential for small-scale earthquakes and water pollution, and that a drive to exploit new gas reserves will turn the focus away from efforts to develop a low-carbon economy to tackle climate change.

Cuadrilla drilled horizontally for some 1,700ft through Micrite formation, a type of limestone, at a depth of around 2,350ft below ground level.

But later its chief executive Francis Egan said the rock underneath the drill site, at Lower Stumble, was already naturally fractured, and the company had no intention of fracking there.

The cost of policing the lengthy protests at Balcombe was nearly £4 million, prompting Sussex police and crime commissioner Katy Bourne to seek financial aid from the Home Office.
