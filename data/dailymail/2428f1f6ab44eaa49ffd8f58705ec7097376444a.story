It's becoming as regular as clockwork at Arsenal: a Theo Walcott contract saga.

Just over two years after signing a £90,000-per-week deal, the winger's future is again in the spotlight.

As Arsene Wenger so jovially put it last week, contact has been made with 'the embassy' (Walcott's representatives) about a contract extension.

Arsenal forward Theo Walcott comes on from the bench against Monaco, is now not a guaranteed starter 

But just like two years ago, there are no guarantees Walcott will commit. Perhaps, even more so this time.

Ever since recovering from a serious knee injury that kept him out for the majority of last year, Walcott has been on the peripheries.

Walcott was flying before injuring his anterior cruciate ligament against Tottenham last January.

He'd established himself as an integral member of Wenger's first-team plans.

Theo Walcott wants a significant pay rise if he is to sign a new Arsenal contract

Since then, though, the landscape at Arsenal has changed. Alexis Sanchez has arrived, so to has Danny Welbeck.

Walcott is no longer indispensable. In addition to Sanchez and Welbeck, there is Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to contend with.

Walcott no longer walks into this team. So, with that in mind, does he warrant a pay-rise?

That's the question Arsenal's moneymen will be asking themselves over the coming weeks.

Because that's what he wants; a hefty hike on his current £4.6million-per-year deal.

Can you justify paying someone in excess of £100,000-per-week who isn't a first-choice option for the manager?

The Arsenal hierarchy are likely to argue not. And all that points to one thing: another Walcott contract row.

You can understand where Walcott's representatives are coming from. At the age of 26, this could be his last big contract.

His advisors have a duty to secure the best possible deal for their client.

There will certainly be takers for Walcott if he leaves this summer. Liverpool and Manchester City are both monitoring the situation closely.

The fact he has pace and is English (helping homegrown quotas) means he will be a valuable commodity if he's made available for transfer.

As for Arsenal, they have four options. The first is to meet his demands, the second is to try to reach a compromise.

The third is to let him enter the final year of his contract, which opens the door to Walcott leaving for nothing next year. Fourth is to sell him this summer.

It's a game of poker. We're waiting to see who'll blink first.

Walcott will be hoping to earn a similar amount to Gunners star man Alexis Sanchez on £140,000-per-week

Walcott looked certain to leave the Emirates Stadium in 2012 after rejecting a new contract.

Wenger managed to persuade the speedster to stay and his subsequent performances led to the Gunners improving their offer, which was signed in January 2013.

There will be a similar incentive for Walcott this time, too. But will he spend enough time on the pitch to make a similar impression?

Things change. Maybe it's time for Walcott to make a change, too.
