If you’re looking to buy Amazon’s Fire TV, search with caution.

The device has a similar name to a porn streaming box called FyreTV, and the company behind the adult service is so put out by the similarity, it is suing the online retailing giant.

WREAL, which also owns FireTV.com, claims Amazon’s Fire TV streaming device is a trademark infringement and is seeking damages, according to papers filed in Florida earlier this week.

WREAL, which owns the FyreTV porn streaming box as well as FireTV.com, claims Amazon's Fire TV device, pictured, is a trademark infringement, according to papers filed in Florida earlier this week. The firm wants a jury trial and is seeking damages, including any profits Amazon makes from the use of the FireTV brand

The Fire TV device, about the size of a CD case, runs Google's Android operating system.

It plugs into HDTVs and offers Netflix, Hulu and other streaming channels in addition to Amazon Prime Instant video.

It comes with a voice-activated Bluetooth remote, which lets users search for videos to watch.

It launched in the U.S for $99 at the start of April but did not confirm a UK release date.

Fire TV also offers a range of other services, including channels like YouTube and Pandora and 'Free Time,' a customisable interface for children.

WREAL launched the trademarked media streamer in 2008, and it only broadcasts porn.

This was six years before Amazon launched its $99 box in the U.S, which connects to HDTVs and lets users stream content from Netflix, Prime Instant Video and Hulu Plus.

The complaint filed by WREAL claims five counts of unauthorised use and infringement on the Fyre brand and states: ‘Amazon’s continued use of the Fire TV moniker has caused, and will continue to cause, serious irreparable harm to WREAL’s established business, necessitating this action.’

It added that the services not only share a similar name, but also perform a similar service that WREAL claims will add to the confusion.

WREAL additionally explained in the files that although the service only offers porn at the moment, it has ‘no intention of limiting the FyreTV brand to adult content. Indeed, the underlying technology that powers FyretV is a flexible and scalable platform capable of delivering content to a wide variety of media streaming devices.’

WREAL is requesting a jury trial with WREAL and damages for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition.

It is also asking for Amazon’s profits from the use of the Fire TV name.

MailOnline has approached Amazon for comment.
