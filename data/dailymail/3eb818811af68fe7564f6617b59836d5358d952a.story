Up to 100 girls are being aborted every year in Britain because of sex-selective terminations in some communities, research has suggested.

An Oxford University study provides disturbing evidence that mothers of Indian origin are much more likely to abort girls than those from other backgrounds.

MPs yesterday voted overwhelmingly in favour of a Bill that would ban abortions on the grounds of gender.

Beautiful baby girl: Oxford research from the study period 1990-2005 found that the ratio of boys to girls born to Indian mothers having their third child was 114 to 100 a much higher than the ratio for mothers of all backgrounds of 104 to 100

They voted 181 to one to make sex-selective abortions illegal, saying the current law had led to ‘widespread confusion’ about what was allowed.

The Oxford study, which covered the years 1990 to 2005, found that the ratio of boys to girls born to Indian mothers having their third child was 114 to 100.

This is much higher than the ratio for mothers of all backgrounds of 104 to 100, and is seen as a sign of sex-selective abortions.

Lead author Sylvie Dubuc said the figures suggested that, on average, about 100 baby girls were missing from the birth register every year during the study period. Her research casts doubt on a government-commissioned study which found there was no evidence of sex-selective abortions in this country.

Following a Daily Telegraph investigation in 2012, the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge two doctors who were caught on camera agreeing to arrange abortions of female foetuses. 

The then director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said: ‘The law does not, in terms, expressly prohibit gender-specific abortions.’

At the time, the Department of Health issued updated rules, saying the 1967 Abortion Act stated that abortion on the grounds of gender was illegal. But MPs say this is not enough, and yesterday they overwhelmingly backed Tory MP Fiona Bruce’s Abortion (Sex-Selection) Bill.

It will now proceed to a second reading in the Commons in January, although it is unlikely to be given time for debate in the build-up to May’s General Election. The only MP who voted against it was Labour’s Glenda Jackson.

'Sex-selective abortions are happening': Tory MP Fiona Bruce has introduced the Abortion (Sex-Selection) Bill to curb the practise

Miss Bruce said the law needed to be clarified to make it explicit to doctors that they cannot terminate pregnancies because of the sex of the unborn child. She added: ‘Sex-selective abortions are happening in the UK and there is widespread confusion over the law. That is why this Bill is needed.

‘Successive health ministers and even the Prime Minister have been very clear. They state that abortion for reasons of gender alone is illegal. But they are being ignored. 

'The British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which performs around 60,000 abortions a year, are still advising women in one of their leaflets and on their website that abortions for reasons of foetal sex is not illegal because the law is silent on the matter.

‘The British Medical Association ... argue there may be cases where having a child of a particular gender may be a legal and ethical justification for an abortion on the grounds that the sex of the child may severely affect the pregnant woman’s mental health.’

A poll commissioned by Christian Concern found that 84 per cent of people believe gender abortion should be ‘explicitly banned by law’.

Rani Bilkhu, from campaign group Jeena International, said British Asian women, as well as those born in South Asia and married to men in the UK, were aborting girls because of the cultural pressure to have sons – often from their in-laws.

She told the BBC: ‘We have a high rate of women coming to us and saying, “We are being threatened and coerced to having abortions – we are being thrown down the stairs.” Once this bill comes out, we can then make sure communities understand that it is illegal to abort on the basis of gender.’

Labour MP Virendra Sharma called for people pressurising Asian women to abort their female foetuses to be ‘named and shamed’ by the authorities.

That's much higher than ratio for mothers of all backgrounds of 104 to 100
