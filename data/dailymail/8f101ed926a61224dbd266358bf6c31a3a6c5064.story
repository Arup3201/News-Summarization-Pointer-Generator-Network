A former PGA golf champion was busted, along with 40 others, including teachers, college students, and a retired beekeeper, in a week-long child sex sting.

‘Operation Red Cheeks’ began January 8 and involved several different crime-fighting organisations across the Orlando, Florida area posing as children in chat rooms.

Pro golfer Steve Thomas, 55, was charged with traveling to seduce an underage girl and using a computer to entice a legal guardian or parent to commit sex acts on an underage girl, according to officials.

The sting: Professional golfer Steve Thomas (pictured) has appeared in 44 PGA tours. Police found three condoms, chocolate pudding, and a bottle of honey in his SUV

The PGA Tour Web site says the Meridian, Mississippi native has finished in the top 10 of a tournament only once, and his winnings stand at just over $25,000.

He has appeared in 44 PGA Tour events. During his sting, he believed he was chatting with a woman about having sex with her 13-year-old daughter.

Police found three condoms, chocolate pudding, and a bottle of honey in his SUV, the arrest affidavit states.

The Osceola County Sheriff’s detectives also arrested 29-year-old Bryan Woodward, who was the head swim coach at Gator Swim Club in Gainsville.

The law won: 40 people - including teachers, a swim coach, and an IT consultant were arrested in the week-long sting in Osecola County, Florida

According to an affidavit, he told a detective posing as a young girl that: ‘younger girls turn me on’ and brought treats with him to meet the ‘child.’

The club’s owner, Kathleen Troy, told the Gainsville Sun that Woodward was no longer working at the club, which is not affiliated with the University of Florida.

‘If anything had come up, we would not have hired him,’ Ms Troy told the paper.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that nine students, ranging in age 18 to 30 were also arrested. The youngest is still in high school.

Police said the success in the sting was due to many local and state agencies working together.

Sheriff Bob Hansell wrote in a statement: ‘These predators stalk the cyber community looking for children to victimise. 

‘This operation resulted in 40 arrests which means at a minimum, 40 children did not fall prey to a sexual deviant.’

Alexander Roy, a 32-year-old eighth grade teacher at Manatee Academy in Port St. Lucie, was placed on administrative leave while the school district conducts the necessary investigation.

Police said that when retired beekeeper Dell Rio Highsmith, 70, was arrested he had with him a heart-shaped box of chocolates, wine, and Viagra pills.

The paper says that the 40 men were accused of everything from travelling to seduce a child to commit sex acts, lewd and lascivious battery of a child, and using a computer to solicit. 

Sheriff Hansell said: ‘This operation should also be a warning to all parents to monitor and be involved with their child’s computer activities.’

All the men arrested now face felony charges.
