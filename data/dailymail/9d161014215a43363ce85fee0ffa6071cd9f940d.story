Tyson Fury’s on-off grudge match with Dereck Chisora will be rescheduled for this autumn even though the giant Mancunian’s initial reaction to Saturday’s chaotic postponement was to wash his fists of the London rival he has defeated once already.

Fury’s frustration with Chisora’s breaking of his left hand was understandable after David Haye’s twin-set of injury withdrawals had stalled his career for so long.

But then Fury himself pulled out of Saturday’s rearranged clash with late replacement Alexander Ustinov when his uncle Hughie, his first trainer at the start of his career, fell suddenly and critically ill as an arterial blood-clot formed after a minor operation.

And a contract is a contract, after all.

Promoter Frank Warren is meeting with the fight family Fury this week to review potential dates. By then Chisora will have received specialist advice as to how soon he can resume sparring, hopefully with a view to fighting before the end of October.

Warren says: ‘What has happened to Tyson’s uncle is terribly unfortunate but we have an agreement to get the fight back on as soon as he and Dereck are available. And it will still be the final eliminator for a world heavyweight title challenge to Wladimir Klitschko.’

Fury says some silly things at times and his belief that obscene tirades sell fights is mistaken but his devotion to the family ethos of the travelling community to which he belongs is genuine beyond question.

Although he knew he would be an easy target for the twitter trolls if he pulled out of a fight after being so critical of Haye and Chisora for doing the same to him, Fury’s emotional concern for his uncle was paramount.

Beneath the lurid public persona lives an engaging 25-year-old lad who is so likeable that his outbursts always come as a surprise to those who have spent time in his company away from the spotlight.

In private, his fierce ambition to become world heavyweight champion is informed by an intelligent thought process which would confound those who despair of his penchant for play-acting as the wild man.

That is part of the dilemma for the British Boxing Board of Control as they prepare to rebuke him for the most vulgar and offensive of his recent outbursts, for which he has apologised.

Nor would it be prudent to press ahead with a disciplinary hearing while his uncle remains in a coma in hospital.

Fury has expressed resentment at being summoned to explain himself and threatens to switch his fights from Britain to Ireland, from where this Catholic family originally hails.

Persona: Fury is a different man away from the camera then the portrayal of him in public

But after only one bout in 15 months – an inconsequential one at that – and with another delay now upon him, Fury does have to be careful how he and his other uncle, Peter who is now his trainer, manage his career at this point.

Fury’s core following comes from in and around Manchester and the big TV pay-nights are to be had in this country. Also, England is a stronger base from which to launch both a world title challenge and an assault on the US boxing market.

Fury is racing Hatfield’s Billy Joe Saunders for the honour of becoming the first boxer of gypsy stock to win a world championship.

Saunders won the European middleweight belt on the Fury-deprived bill in Manchester by stopping Italy’s Emanuele Blandamura and hopes to meet Chris Eubank Jnr in a world title eliminator next.The sooner Fury can get Chisora back in the ring, the better.

Australian legend Jeff Fenech believes his protegee Lucas Browne can become his country’s first world heavyweight champion.

Fenech, a three-division world title holder in his own right, bases that prediction on his first-hand experience of the comparative punching power between Browne and world champion heavyweight phenomenon Mike Tyson.

Strong man: Lucas Browne is a powerful puncher, according to his trainer Jeff Fencher

Now Browne’s trainer, Fenech also worked
 the pads and the corner for Iron Mike during some of his days as the 
most feared fighter on the planet.

Fenech says: ‘Holding the pads for Lucas hurts me more than Tyson did. Two of the present world heavyweight belt holders will be vulnerable to Lucas, who is really heavy-handed. It will be tremendous for Aussie boxing if he can make heavyweight history.’

The British boxing public will have a chance to evaluate that claim on Friday night under Ricky Hatton’s promotional banner.

Browne is one of three Australians in the stable of the Manchester Hitman, who fancies the chances of his man from Down Under against either Tyson Fury or Dereck Chisora.

Hard hitting: Browne's punching power is comparable to that of a young Mike Tyson

Browne is taking on Ukrainian Andriy Rudenko in Wolverhampton for minor WBC and WBA belts.Victory would lift him higher up the queue  to challenge WBC heavyweight champion Bermane Stiverne or WBA ‘regular’ title holder Rusian Chagaev, both of whom Fenech is convinced he could beat.

Browne is the chief supporting attraction on the Wolverhampton undercard for Frankie Gavin’s European welterweight title fight with the tough Leonard Bungu.

Some are calling him the Baby-Faced Assassin and he does bear quite a resemblance to Terry Spinks, our late 1956 Olympic gold medallist and former British featherweight champion.

Others are talking of him as the middleweight Mike Tyson and 27 knock-outs in an undefeated 30-fight record strengthen that comparison.

Gennady Golovkin is blazing a trail of destruction through his classic division, as his latest victim willingly testifies.

Winner: Golovkin celebrates after knocking Geale out at Madison Square Garden

Smiles: And he celebrates with his belts after the bout on Saturday night

Daniel Geale, himself a recent world champion, was blown away inside three rounds of their title fight in New York’s Madison Square Garden this Saturday night and promptly said: ‘I’ve never seen, let alone been hit by, a harder puncher in my life. The first time he lands on you comes as a shock.’

Thus Geale tacitly confirmed all the scary stories emanating from gyms in America of how Golovkin, despite using gloves like pillows, is flattening sparring partners almost twice his size and wearing head-guards.

One report claims that in order to get some kind of sparring, the man from Kazakhstan often has to promise not to punch his opponents in the head.

So he drops them with disembowelling body-shots, like the one which took out Anglo-Irish challenger Matthew Macklin around this time last year.

Golovkin, at 32,  is coming to prominence late. First there was a 350-fight world-title-winning amateur career in which he lost only five times. Then the pros kept ducking him.

Challenger: He could be set for a fight with Miguel Cotto of Puerto Rico

But now the big money is getting behind him and the US television moguls are pressing Miguel Cotto to meet Golovkin in a battle to unify their various world 160 lb titles.

The huge Puerto Rican support for Cotto in New York and the frenzy growing around Golovkin  would make for a mega-night in the mecca of the Garden.

The middleweight Iron Mike? Golovkin has not only the punch but the chin to suggest he may well be.

A split-second before he was knocked out Geale connected with his best punch of those three rounds, a peach of a right cross flush to the Kazakh jaw.

Golovkin, without so much as a flinch, instantly delivered his concussive left-right combination.

Then he grinned, as all the ring’s Baby-Faced Assassins have tended to do down the decades as they help their fallen prey to their feet.

Golovkin smiles a lot. Rather like an innocent kid. Not unlike how we remember Terry Spinks.

But then he has a lot to smile about. Like it being six years and 17 fights since he was taken the distance.
