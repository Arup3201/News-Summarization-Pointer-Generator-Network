A new image released by NASA reveals a previously unseen view of Saturn and its rings using a navigation technique called a 'pi transfer'.

The picture was taken by the space agency’s Cassini probe during a flyby past the planet's largest moon Titan when it was about 764,000 miles (1.23 million km) from Saturn.

A pi transfer uses the gravity of the moon to alter the orbit of the Cassini spacecraft so it can gain different perspectives on Saturn and achieve a wide variety of science objectives.

Nasa said taking in the rings in their entirety was the focus of this particular imaging sequence. Therefore, the camera exposure times were just right to capture the dark-side of its rings, but longer than that required to properly expose the globe of sunlit Saturn.

As a result, the sunlit half of the planet is overexposed.

The view is a mosaic of 36 images - that is, 12 separate sets of red, green and blue images - taken over the course of about 2.5 hours, as Cassini scanned across the entire main ring system.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 40 degrees above the ring plane.

Among the interplay of Saturn's shadow and rings, Mimas, which appears in the lower-right corner of the image, orbits Saturn as a set of the ever-intriguing spokes appear in the B ring (just to the right of centre)

The images in this natural-color view were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera at a distance of approximately 1.23 million km from Saturn. Image scale is 70 kilometers (44 miles) per pixel.

Last week Nasa released pictures taken on October 22, 2013, which showed the planet’s dazzling rings in unprecedented detail, along with its 'Death Star' moon seen glowing in the distance.

The planet’s moon Mimas, also known as
 the ‘Death Star’ because of its resemblance to the space station, is 
visible as a pin prick of light at the bottom right.

The image also shows the mysterious ‘spokes’ in Saturn's B ring, just to the right of centre.

In a talk at American Geophysical Union in December, Professor Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from Nasa's Cassini spacecraft. The mysterious object, which was located at the right edge of Saturn's A ring, has been named 'Peggy' after Professor Murray's mother-in-law

Mimas is an inner moon of Saturn and averages 246 miles (396 km) in diameter.  Mimas and another Saturn moon, Rhea, have been called ‘the most heavily cratered body in the solar system.’

Based on data gathered from the Cassini spacecraft, scientists last year estimated that Saturn’s rings date back more than four billion years.

Its images have provided some surprises for scientists in the past few years.

For instance in a talk at American Geophysical Union in December, Professor Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft.

The mysterious object, which was located at the right edge of Saturn’s A ring, has been named ‘Peggy’ after Professor Murray’s mother-in-law.

Peggy is thought to be about a 0.6 miles (1km) in diameter, which experts claim is too small for it to be a moon.

It could, however, be the build-up of ring material that has collapsed gravitationally under its own weight.

Some of Saturn’s moons, particularly those orbiting near the rings, are thought to have formed in this way, creating a ring of dust then collecting more material to grow.

The planet is known to have of 53 natural rings with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings. Some moons, such as Prometheus and Pandora, interact with ring material, shepherding the ring in its orbit.
