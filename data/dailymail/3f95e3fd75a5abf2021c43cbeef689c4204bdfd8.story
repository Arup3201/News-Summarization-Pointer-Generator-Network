If the driver of this Land Rover was looking for a good parking spot on the way to work this morning, this is probably the last thing she had in mind.

And the cost of repairing the smashed up vehicle will cost a lot more than your average parking ticket.

Fortunately the woman driver of the Discovery escaped this nasty looking incident relatively unscathed but her car came off considerably the worse for wear.

Wrong turning: Fortunately the driver of this Land Rover Discovery escaped serious injury when her car careered into a subway in Chelmsford, Essex, this morning

Smash: Police cordoned off part of the road after the car collided with a bus and crashed through the subway railings

It landed flat on its front and was left
 perched precariously against the wall of a subway in Chelmsford, Essex,
 at around 9.30am this morning.

The car had collided with a bus on Parkway before careering through the metal crash barriers and down into the underpass.

Luckily, there were no pedestrians walking down the path at the time of the crash.

The smash happened on a busy stretch of road close to the town centre and a number of shops and businesses.

Stuck: Police officers look on as the back end of the black Land Rover can be seen above a line of traffic on the busy Essex road

One witness said that the subway is often used by children heading to a nearby school.

A section of the road was closed off and eventually the car was lifted out of the subway using a small crane.

Onlookers gathered to take pictures of the unusual sight while police cordoned off the walkway.

The driver of the car was taken to hospital but received only minor injuries.

No one was arrested following the crash and the road was reopened shortly afterwards.

Wrecked: The car had to be pulled from the underpass using a crane while dozens of people looked on and took pictures
