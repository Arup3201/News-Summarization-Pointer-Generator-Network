The company behind Barbie is releasing Lego-style building blocks based on the iconic doll.

Mega Bloks Barbie will allow young girls to build, design and decorate their own, mainly pink, Barbie world – and even construct her signature convertible car.

The new line of toys is a result of a collaboration between Mattel and the makers of Mega Bloks. It appears to be a reaction to the decision by Lego to launch a hugely successful – but controversial – series of building sets specifically for girls, called Lego Friends.

There has also been a trend towards more gender neutral toys as manufacturers and retailers react to concern among some parents that boys and girls are being stereotyped from an early age.

However, the Barbie construction sets, with their vivid pink colours, are definitely more girly than gritty.

Mega Bloks Barbie invites girls to build, design and decorate their own Barbie world with compatible playsets and mini-fashion figures.

Girls will be able to build a luxury mansion, a fashion boutique and even the Barbie doll’s signature convertible car one pink brick at a time.

The sets, which are designed for girls aged four and up launched in the USA ahead of Christmas and are coming to UK stores in March.

Mini-figures of Barbie and her friends start at £5.99, while the ‘Build and Style’ pink convertible is £16.99, a pool party set is £39.99 and the luxury mansion is £79.99.

Lego launched its construction sets for girls – Lego Friends – a year ago. That is also dominated by pink and pastel colours, while the set themes include a beauty parlour, a café, a stage, a convertible car and a splash pool.

The initiative drew some criticism from parents on web forums with commentators arguing it was wrong to restrict children to specific types of toys and colours.

Some complained that it was a betrayal of what had previously been a ‘beautifully genderless toy’.

Dr Maureen O’Brien, developmental psychologist and Mega Bloks child play expert, said girls love and benefit from creative construction just as much as boys.

‘Playing with building toys provides children with an ideal way to engage in discovery-based learning,’ she said.

‘It is through this type of learning that children are able to build their confidence through trial and error and develop a sense of achievement, enabling them to physically link their world to the play world, building their brain power in the process.

‘Combining block play with open-ended and imaginative play, children experience an extraordinary level of brain building.

‘This combination of play patterns encourages exploration and storytelling, building context for children and a better understanding of the world around them.’

A senior vice president for Mattel, Stephanie Cota(correct), explained the decision to launch the sets, saying: ‘We know what girls want in Barbie’s world – to imagine, explore and discover.

‘The Mega Bloks Barbie collection invites girls to build Barbie’s world in a way that is true to the Barbie brand – fashionable and aspirational.'
