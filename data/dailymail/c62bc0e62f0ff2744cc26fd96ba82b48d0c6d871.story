A grand jury indicted Texas Governor Rick Perry on Friday for allegedly abusing the powers of his office by carrying out a threat to veto funding for state prosecutors investigating public corruption — making the possible 2016 presidential hopeful his state's first indicted governor in nearly a century.

Perry is charged with abuse of official capacity, a felony that carries a sentence of between five and 99 years prison, and coercion of a public servant, which is punishable by two to 10 years in prison.

Perry threatened to pull funds - $8 million worth - from the Travis County District Attorney's Public Integrity office if its head, Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, didn't resign after a very public drink-driving conviction.

At the time Perry demanded Lehmberg's resignation, her unit had just begun investigating the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) - a $3 billion pet project of Perry's - regarding suspicious state grants disbursed by the Institute to allies of Perry.

Indicted on two felonies: Rick Perry is facing serious charges that carry lengthy jail time

Indicted: Travis County special prosecutor Mchael McCrum announces that Governor Rick Perry, 63, is charged with abuse of official capacity, a first-degree felony, and coercion of a public official related to his effort last year to force District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg to resign after her drunken driving arrest

Had Lehmberg resigned, Perry would 
have replaced her with one of his Republican cohorts - thus ending the 
investigation and others by the Democrat-run Travis County District 
Attorney's office, a thorn in Perry's side.

However,
 Lehmberg refused to resign her position, with the support of fellow 
Democrats who didn't want the office to pass into Republican hands - and
 Perry made good on his threat.

A
 special prosecutor spent months calling witnesses and presenting 
evidence that Perry broke the law when he promised publicly to nix $7.5 
million over two years for the public integrity unit run by the office 
of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg. Lehmberg, a 
Democrat, was convicted of drunken driving, but refused Perry's calls to
 resign.

Though the 
Republican governor now faces two felony indictments, politics dominates
 the case. Lehmberg is based in Austin, which is heavily Democratic, in 
contrast to most of the rest of fiercely conservative Texas. The grand 
jury was comprised of Austin-area residents.

The
 unit Lehmberg oversees investigates statewide allegations of corruption
 and political wrongdoing. It led the investigation against former U.S. 
House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican who in 2010 was 
convicted of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering 
for taking part in a scheme to influence elections in his home state — 
convictions later vacated by an appeals court.

A Texas grand jury indicted Republican Gov. Rick Perry on Friday on charges that he abused his position in a 2013 tussle over his state's Public Integrity Unit, headed by a Democratic official who was convicted of drunk driving

Rosemary Lehmberg was sentenced to 45 days in jail for DUI, about half of which she served before her release, and was ordered to pay a $4,000 fine

Perry stands accused of abusing his office by warning that he would veto funding for the Public Integrity Unit, which Lehmberg (L) runs. The governor made his threat in an attempt to get Lehmberg to resign following her drunk driving conviction (booking photo at right) in 2013

Mary Anne Wiley, Perry's general counsel, predicted on Friday that the governor will be cleared of the charges against him – abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant.

'The
 veto in question was made in accordance with the veto authority 
afforded to every governor under the Texas Constitution,' she said.

Perry issued a public statement along with his veto, writing in June 2013 that '[d]espite the otherwise good work [of] the Public Integrity Unit’s employees, I cannot in good conscience support continued state funding for an office with statewide jurisdiction at a time when the person charged with ultimate responsibility of that unit has lost the public’s confidence.'

David
 L. Botsford, Perry's defense attorney, whose $450-per hour fees are 
being paid for by state funds, said Friday that he was outraged by the indictment.

'This
 clearly represents political abuse of the court system and there is no 
legal basis in this decision,' Botsford said in a statement.

'Today's
 action, which violates the separation of powers outlined in the Texas 
Constitution, is nothing more than an effort to weaken the 
constitutional authority granted to the office of Texas governor, and 
sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a grand jury to punish the 
exercise of a lawful and constitutional authority afforded to the Texas 
governor.'

Several top aides to Perry appeared before grand jurors, including his deputy chief of staff, legislative director and general counsel. Perry himself was not called to testify.

Abuse of official capacity is a first-degree felony with potential punishments of five to 99 years in prison. Coercion of a public servant is a third-degree felony that carries a punishment of two to 10 years.

In office since 2000 and already the longest-serving governor in Texas history, Perry isn't seeking re-election in November.

When he ran for president in 2012, 
Perry plummeted from brief front-runner to national punchline, his once 
promising campaign doomed by a series of embarrassing gaffes.

Almost immediately after news of his indictment broke, Gov. Perry continued putting out red-meat messages for his conservative Twitter audience, continuing to send signals about a potential presidential run in 2016

His most infamous 'Oops' moment came 
during a primary debate when he couldn't remember which three 
cabinet-level federal agencies he had promised to abolish if he were to 
win the White House.

As
 he eyes another run, Perry has re-made his cowboy image, 
donning stylish glasses, studying up on foreign and domestic affairs and
 promising conservatives nationally that he's far more humble this time 
around.

Political 
observers say the indictment may not immediately hurt his standing with 
Republican primary voters – but Democrats didn't miss a change to gloat 
Friday.

'Texans deserve 
real leadership and this is unbecoming of our governor,' Texas 
Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. He 
demanded that Perry immediately resign.

No
 one disputes that Perry is allowed to veto measures approved by the 
Legislature. But the left-leaning Texans for Public Justice government 
watchdog group filed an ethics complaint accusing the governor of 
coercion because he threatened to use his veto before actually doing so 
in an attempt to pressure Lehmberg to quit.

'We're pleased that the grand jury determined that the governor's bullying crossed the line into illegal behavior,' said Craig McDonald, executive director of Texans for Public Justice. 'The complaint had merit, serious laws were potentially broken.'

Michael McCrum, the San Antonio-based special prosecutor, said he 'took into account the fact that we're talking about a governor of a state - and a governor of the state of Texas, which we all love.'

'Obviously that carries a lot of importance,' McCrum said. 'But when it gets down to it, the law is the law.'

McCrum
 said he'll meet with Botsford on Monday to discuss when he will come to
 the courthouse to be arraigned. McCrum said he doesn't know when Perry 
will be booked.

Perry and 
other high-profile Republicans said Lehmberg should resign after she was
 arrested and pleaded guilty to drunken driving in April 2013. A video 
recording made at the jail showed Lehmberg shouting at staffers to call 
the sheriff, kicking the door of her cell and sticking her tongue out. 
Her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit for 
driving.

The indictment of Perry is the first of its kind since 1917, when James 'Pa'
 Ferguson was indicted on charges stemming from his veto of state 
funding to the University of Texas in an effort to unseat faculty and 
staff members he objected to. Ferguson was eventually impeached, then 
resigned before being convicted.
