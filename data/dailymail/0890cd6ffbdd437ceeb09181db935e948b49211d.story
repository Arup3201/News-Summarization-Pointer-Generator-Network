Despite Arsenal confirming their interest in Carlos Vela, Real Sociedad president Jokin Apperibay says the forward wants to stay at the Basque club

The Gunners informed Sociedad of their intent to activate their £3.5m buyout clause, with the Apperibay negotiating with the club in London this week.

But Vela has told Apperibay that he would like to remain in San Sebastian, rather than returning to the side he left in 2012.

'We are fortunate that the player is keen to stay in San Sebastian with us and that's an important factor for Real Sociedad,' Apperibay told reporters.

The president also explained that the two clubs were yet to reach an agreement for the player, who Arsenal signed back in 2005 from boyhood club Guadalajara.

Arsenal are looking for a player to play back-up to current striker Olivier Giroud, as well as helping out wide, a bill which Vela fits.

He has said in the past that he would be willing to adapt to the Premier League once again, but this updated news seems to distance him from a summer switch.
