At least 19 companies face a major criminal investigation over claims they knew corrupt private detectives were breaking the law on their behalf, the Information Commissioner announced last night.

Christopher Graham said the group of firms, which include those from the legal, financial, and insurance industries, will be probed over whether they breached data protection rules.

He also said his review of evidence handed over by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) suggested a total of 125 suspected victims of privacy breaches.

Astounded: Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, said he was 'baffled' as to why the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) took so long to act

It is a key development in revelations about corrupt private eyes employed by non-media companies. Despite a criminal inquiry into the detectives themselves, at first nothing was done to examine whether their paymasters knew they were breaking the law.

The scandal erupted when MPs discovered a list of 98 firms who had hired four private eyes jailed last year as part of Operation Millipede for ‘blagging’ private information, or acquiring it on false pretexts.

Despite holding the list, and a vast array of evidence from the trial, Soca was accused of failing to investigate any wrongdoing.

Comments: Tory MP and senior committee member James Clappison has said there are still many questions to be answered in the scandal

MPs on the home affairs select committee who discovered the existence of the list threatened to publish it, but backed down when Soca gave it to Mr Graham’s office. He launched a review, resulting in yesterday’s announcement.

Soca had refused to name the firms because it was possible they knew nothing about the activities of investigators they had hired. Last night home affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was ‘baffled’ as to why the crime agency did nothing for years when it took the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) just two weeks to act.

Mr Vaz said: ‘The Commissioner has kept his promise to Parliament and provided the information requested promptly and efficiently.I am, however, baffled that for over four years Soca failed to conduct a scoping exercise which has taken the ICO two weeks to complete.’

When the MPs took the list of 98 from Soca they agreed not to make it public. However, around 33 of the names on it have emerged.

Mr Graham did not identify those under investigation, but said the 19 clients were a construction firm, two financial companies, five retailers, three insurance firms, four law firms, and one security company.

The final three are private detective agencies who outsourced work. The ICO examined 31 Soca files, including invoices, letters, reports, notes and account details. Some of it dates back as far as 2001.

Worryingly, 12 firms are no longer trading – so may have escaped investigation because of the delay. The ICO is looking for information on a further 11.

Tory MP and senior committee member James Clappison said: ‘This begs many questions as to what has been happening over a period of years.

‘There are many questions that need to be answered.’
