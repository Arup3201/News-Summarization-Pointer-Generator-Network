The father of a serial rapist says his own son should be locked up and they should 'throw away the key' after he was convicted of yet another offence.

Jimmy Hunt has disowned his son, Lynx Caan, who served nine years in jail for five rapes against two women and threatening to kill his girlfriend.

Caan, born Jonathan Hunt, made his latest appearance at Hull Crown Court for breaching his notification requirements under the sex offenders register.

Disgusted: Jimmy Hunt and his wife Doreen (left) say rapist son Lynx Caan (right) should be jailed for life

The 43-year-old was handed a nine-month suspended sentence, after police discovered he was using another alias - one of eight - on Facebook, 'Jon Karma Rea'. 

Blasting the ruling, his father Mr Hunt, 65, and his wife, Doreen, 63, want everyone to know how much they suffer each time their son reoffends.

Mr Hunt said: 'If I was a judge, I’d lock him up and throw away the key.

'He’s spent 14 years of his life in jail but it doesn’t deter him.

'He thinks he’s got a right to come into people’s lives and threaten them - we are not having it.

'I don’t want him in our lives any more.

'He’s been banned from our home for eight years - I don’t love him anymore.'

Struggle: The couple claim they are harassed by passers-by as Caan is convicted of breaching the restrictions of the sex offenders register. He has already served nine years for five rapes of two women

He says the pair can no longer go out and about without being blamed for the crimes Lynx commits.

The couple have even discussed moving to avoid the harassment they get daily.

The 65-year-old said: 'We daren’t walk into our local.

'People always say "your lads been in the paper" - it always comes back to Doreen and I.

'I didn’t bring him up to be like this - we don’t and never have condoned what he’s done.'

Caan's barrister, Nigel Clive, said he had created the bogus profile to avoid a woman in York, who had been warned by police about her conduct towards him.

Caan declined to comment on suggestions he had brought shame on the family.
