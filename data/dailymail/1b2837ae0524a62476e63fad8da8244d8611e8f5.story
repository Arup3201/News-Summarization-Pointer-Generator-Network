Lounging on a boat in Marbella, this is the former public schoolboy who sent vile sexist abuse to a leading academic on Twitter.

Oliver Rawlings, 20, branded Cambridge classicist Mary Beard a ‘filthy old slut’, and added a revolting sexual comment.

Yesterday Professor Beard, who silenced Rawlings by naming and shaming him as a Twitter troll, offered to take the student ‘out for a drink and smack his bottom’.

Oliver Rawlings quickly apologised for his puerile and aggressive comments after a Twitter user offered to send Mary Beard his parents' address

But his wealthy parents are likely to be  less forgiving, Rawlings’s aunt said last night.

‘This is totally out of character,’  
62-year-old Joy Rawlings told the Daily Mail.

‘He is normally a very 
polite and well-mannered young man.

'His parents won’t be impressed in 
the slightest.’

Rawlings attended the £9,759-a-year 
Cheadle Hulme School in Greater Manchester, and according to his 
Facebook page is a student at Nottingham University.

He was keeping a low profile yesterday having deleted his Twitter account, and is understood to be out of the country.

At the £1.2million gated home in Hale,
Greater Manchester, where he lives with his mother Joanne and 
Bentley-driving accountant father Martin, 53, the only sign of life 
yesterday was a housekeeper who refused to come to the door.

But one neighbour said: ‘Oliver will 
get a right telling off. His dad, especially, will hit the roof.’

Rawlings used his own Twitter account 
to send abuse to Professor Beard while she was speaking to Jeremy Vine 
on BBC Radio 2 on Monday, about how she had been victimised by trolls.

After she forwarded his attack to her 42,000 followers – one of whom 
offered to send her his mother’s postal address – Rawlings wrote: ‘I 
sincerely apologise for my trolling.

'I was wrong and very rude.

'Thanks 4
showing me the error of my ways.’

Professor Beard, who said she had 
accepted Rawlings’s apology, was asked on BBC Radio 5 Live yesterday 
whether she would consider meeting him.

She replied: ‘Yes, I’d take him 
out for a drink and smack his bottom. I just hope he never does it 
again.’ 

Also in hiding yesterday was  
21-year-old Jack Riley, who was held by police after allegedly using 
Twitter to threaten a journalist with rape over her campaign to keep 
women on bank notes.

The fall-out facing both men illustrates how 
‘trolling’ – sending crude or hurtful abuse to total strangers over the 
internet – can snare otherwise respectable young people.

Riley, a car mechanic from Prestwich, 
Manchester, was arrested on Sunday and taken to London for questioning 
over an offensive message he allegedly sent to Caroline Criado-Perez 
after she backed plans to put Jane Austen on the new £10 note.

His family said he was in hiding after
being released on bail, and his elder brother branded his arrest an 
over-reaction on Twitter.

Sam Riley, 26, a part-time club DJ, posted: 
‘It was wrong what he did, but it was not a threat to rape or kill as 
reported.’

Riley’s boss, car dealership managing 
director Alan Grimshaw, told the Mail he had been given a couple of days
off work ‘to get his head together’.

Del Harvey, Twitter’s so-called director for trust and safety, said the website had failed the women.

She said: ‘Any time that someone 
feels we weren’t responsive, or weren’t reactive or we didn’t care then,
yes, we failed in that instance and we need to do better.’

Hundreds of internet trolls were prosecuted last year, it was revealed yesterday.

The Crown Prosecution Service said it had brought more than 1,700 cases to court involving abuse sent online or  by mobile phone text message in 2012, up 10 per cent on the year before.

A further 600 charges have already been brought against internet and text bullies in the first five months of this year.

The figures, released under the Freedom of Information act, reveal the extent of trolling – although experts warned that prosecutions against abusers represented a tiny fraction of the problem.

They emerged as police arrested a second man over Twitter rape and death threats. The 25-year-old man was held by Northumbria Police on suspicion of harassment in relation to abusive Twitter messages sent to MP Stella Creasy and journalist Caroline Criado-Perez.

Both women were inundated with vile threats after their campaign to have more women represented on banknotes.

The threats continued yesterday as the trolls taunted police and stepped up their abuse.
