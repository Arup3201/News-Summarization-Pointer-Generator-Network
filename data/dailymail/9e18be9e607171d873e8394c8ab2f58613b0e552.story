A highly contagious gastric flu virus was the cause of two outbreaks of vomiting and diarrhoea at the restaurant of MasterChef Australia judge George Calombaris.

The celebrity chef was forced to shut his Hellenic Republic in Kew for 24 hours last Friday after two group of diners fell ill on Mother's Day and a few more last Wednesday.

As one of the co-owners of the Melbourne restaurant, Calombaris said he was 'absolutely devastated by the recent events'.

'I have an incredible team at Hellenic in Kew and we are all absolutely devastated by the recent events. I am so sorry for those poor people that have been affected and to those inconvenienced by us taking precautionary measures and closing down the venue,' he said.

The spokeswoman for the restaurant said the Department of Health investigated both incidents and concluded that guests suffered from norovirus, which 'is currently sweeping through Melbourne'.

'A full deep clean has already taken place to ensure the restaurant is norovirus free and the Department of Health is happy for us to return to full and normal trading,' she said.

They are still trying to identify how the virus entered the venue and are working together to avoid similar incidents from recurring in the future.

Results are expected to be released in a few weeks.

The Department of Health spokesman confirmed that they 'were advised late last Tuesday of illness among diners at that restaurant'.

'We are obviously taking samples from those who fell ill and also looking at samples of food.'

A clean-up of the restaurant was conducted under Boroondara Council supervision.

Department officials are contacting people who fell ill to piece together their food histories, the spokesman said.

'People who may have dined there on Sunday and who have come down with symptoms of vomiting or diarrhoea should seek medical attention,' he said.

Calombaris owns a 25 per cent stake in Made Establishment, which controls Hellenic Republic in Kew and Brunswick, along with The Press Club and Gazi in the central business district.

The Made Establishment spokeswoman said resolving the cause of the illness was the business' highest priority.

'Although there is no evidence as to the cause of this, we are working closely together with Boroondara Council and health authorities to discover the cause,' she said.

Calombaris makes up one-third of the judging panel on Masterchef alongside Gary Mehigan, and Matt Preston.
