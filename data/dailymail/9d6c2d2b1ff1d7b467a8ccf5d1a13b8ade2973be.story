Donald Trump's former 'starter mansion' has been put on the market for $54million, according to listing agent Tamar Laurie. 

The impressive  20,000-square-foot Greenwich, Connecticut, estate has eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a putting green, movie theater, tennis courts and three staff apartments.

Donald and Ivana Trump bought the 5.8-acre estate in 1982 for $4million, according to Business Insider.  

Ivana Trump then refurbished the home - originally built in 1939 - with the same materials used to renovate Manhattan's Plaza Hotel around the same time. 

She then got the mansion as part of the couple's divorce in 1991 and sold it seven years later for $15million.

When the new owners renovated the place in 2000, they added tennis courts, guest rooms and an indoor lap pool. The current owners, who have remained anonymous, listed the home with Tamar Laurie of Coldwell Banker.

The 5.8-acre estate features views of the water, a putting green, outdoor and indoor pools, tennis courts and a  dock

The entrance to the Greenwich, Connecticut, home has two massive, luxuriously carpeted staircases leading up to a second floor

After the Trumps divorced in 1991, Ivana Trump held on to the house for seven years before selling it for $15million

The new owners toned down the house's decorations when they bought it. It was reportedly 'dripping in gold leaf' at one time, according to Business Insider

Chandeliers and fireplaces can be found in numerous rooms throughout the 20,000-square-foot mansion

The current owners of the Trumps' 'starter' mansion renovated the eight-bedroom home in 2000. They listed it this year with Tamar Laurie for $54million

The room pictured above seems to have a cohesive blue theme. Other rooms use yellow and pink as decorative themed colors

One dining area seats 11 in lush pink chairs that match the chandelier hanging above. The dishware on the table appears to be gold and white

One of the home's ten bathrooms is covered with green tiles, coordinating with the green towels and rug, stained glass windows and wall-length mirrors

The home even has its own private movie theater that appears to seat at least 13 people in front of a big screen and projector

An indoor lap pool was put into the home when the current owners decided to renovate the home in 2000

Seating areas in a glassed-in sun room  overlook the massive estate and nearby small islands in the water

Because the home is on a peninsula, residents have ample views of Long Island Sound in Indian Harbor 

Not only does the home have an indoor lap pool, but it also has an outdoor pool that looks out on to Long Island Sound

A deck with multiple glass tables looks out on to the water, where residents can enjoy the sun on summer days

The white and black home looks pristine as it sits on a perfectly groomed lawn behind the pool

The home has a massive dock on the edge of the property for those interested in hitting the waters of Long Island Sound

The estate even has a putting green, where residents can perfect their swing and test out their clubs

The peninsula estate in Greenwich, Connecticut , is surrounded by trees and water, making it private from nearby neighbors
