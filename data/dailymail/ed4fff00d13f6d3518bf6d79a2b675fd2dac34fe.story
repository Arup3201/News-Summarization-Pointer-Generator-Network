Former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman has backed calls for a World Cup boycott to force FIFA to introduce more reforms and admitted that some of England's tactics in pursuing votes for its 2018 bid were 'unwise'.

Triesman, England 2018's first bid chairman until he was forced to resign after being taped making derogatory remarks about rival bids, also said he was now prepared to meet World Cup ethics investigator Michael Garcia about the 2018 and 2022 bids.

His successor at the FA, David Bernstein, who stepped down from the post in 2013, has called for UEFA to lead a boycott of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

Triesman told Sky Sports News: 'David Bernstein has been saying Europe should get its act together and preferably do it together and I think he's got an extremely strong point and I support it.

'Michel Platini and UEFA should be saying 'if you want the Europeans involved in this world sport then it's got to be a clean sport run in a transparent way and to standards that are exacting'.

'Russia will of course resist it but the fact of the matter is the most powerful of all the continental football groups is in a position to influence it, as are the major sponsors and I think until FIFA is confronted by that it will never change.'

Ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert last week made a number of criticisms of England 2018's tactics in trying to win the vote of now-disgraced former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, including securing a job for an associate of his and picking up the bill for a £35,000 gala dinner.

Triesman added: 'I think the pursuit of some people and their votes was probably done in a way that was unwise. Maybe I would say that.

'People used to complain because I and Jack Warner couldn't bear to be in the same room as one another so the idea that we were cosy with each other never occurred and there were no exchanges of promises or gifts in that period.

'In my view it would have been much more sensible for England to have been at greater arm's lengths of someone like Jack Warner. I said that at the time so I'm not saying anything new today.'

Triesman said he had wanted to speak to Garcia but had been prevented from doing so as he was being sued at the time - unsuccessfully, by Thailand's FIFA member Worawi Makudi - and had been advised not to do so as the case was sub judice.
