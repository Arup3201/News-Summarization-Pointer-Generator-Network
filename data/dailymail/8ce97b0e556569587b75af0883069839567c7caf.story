Numbers game: The change means a caller dialling a local family member, business or take-away will have to punch in 11-digits

Families in many fast-growing areas will have to dial the full national code to reach local people and businesses in a radical shake-up of the telephone system.

Telecoms watchdog Ofcom is making the change in a bid to overcome a predicted shortage of telephone numbers.

Families in Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch will be the first to experience the new system from November this year, adding 01202 to the front of any six-digit local number.

Another 44 areas will have to adopt the new regime by 2021.

The change means a caller dialling a local family member, business or take-away will have to punch in an 11-digit number.

Independent consumer research for the regulator found widespread scepticism that the country is running out of phone numbers.

Separately, many people, particularly the elderly, may struggle to get to grips with the new regime.

But Ofcom insists the change is the ‘least disruptive’ way to  create thousands of new numbers in areas with a heavy demand.

After the Bournemouth area, six places – Aberdeen, Brighton and Hove, Bradford, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes and Stoke on Trent – will adopt national codes for local numbers by 2016.

Nine more areas – Blackpool, Dundee, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Plymouth, Southend-on-Sea, Swansea, and Swindon – will change by 2018.

A further 29 more will switch to the 
new regime by 2021, ranging from Guildford to Hull, Exeter and 
Gloucester to Bradford, and Cambridge to Wolverhampton.

Ofcom stressed that call charges will not rise as a result.

The watchdog said the changes are necessary ‘to safeguard the future supply of landline number across the UK’.

It said: ‘In a small number of areas 
of the UK, where phone numbers are becoming very scarce, people will 
need to dial the whole number when making local calls.

Ringing in the changes: Ofcom insists the move is the 'least disruptive' way to create thousands of new numbers in areas with a heavy demand

‘This measure will enable Ofcom to 
make more numbers available in those areas. Ofcom’s consumer research 
shows this to be the least disruptive option for making new phone 
numbers available for homes and businesses.'

Currently, Ofcom cannot allocate phone
 numbers in which the first digit after the area code is 0 or 1 - for 
example, 01202 075 362 or 01273 118 903.

This
 is because the network computers may confuse the number with other 
dialling codes or with a number reserved for special use, such as 118 
for directory enquiries.

Once
 a requirement to use the national code is in place, hundreds of 
thousands of new local number combinations beginning 0 or 1 can be 
created.

Independent 
research by analysts Futuresight found many consumers simply did not 
believe that fixed line telephone numbers are running out.

However, some 51 out of 63 people involved in focus groups backed the scheme chosen by Ofcom, although there was some resistance with one describing the change as ‘a bit of nuisance’.

Futuresight said: ‘For both businesses and consumers, closing the local dialling facility was seen as the least disruptive route and, behaviourally, an easy step.’

It added: ‘There is very clear evidence to suggest that whilst local dialling is still widely used by residential consumers and businesses, it is largely taken for granted and seen as ‘nice to have’, not a necessity.

‘Very few consumers or businesses had concerns if it was to disappear.’

One reason for the shortage of numbers is that several telecom giants are effectively hoarding blocks of numbers that might be issued to new customers at a future date.

Ofcom is launching a pilot scheme to charge telecoms firms 10p a year for every phone number they hold to provide a financial incentive on them to give them up to people who need them.
