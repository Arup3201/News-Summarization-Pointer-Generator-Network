A 16-year-old boy is in intensive care after taking a 'mortal kombat' ecstasy pill at a house party, police believe.

Tests are also being carried out on a 
17-year-old boy, after both fell ill yesterday evening in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire.

The 16-year-old is said to be in a serious, but stable condition.

Warning: A 16-year-old has been left in a serious condition after police believe he took mortal kombat

Police Scotland believe the pair, who were admitted to Monklands District General Hospital in Airdrie at about 11.30pm, had taken illegal drugs including ecstasy and 'possibly' a mortal kombat tablet.

The distinctive red tablet with a dragon image imprinted on it is an ecstasy-style drug and is thought to have been responsible for the death of 17-year-old Regane MacColl last month.

Miss MacColl, from West 
Dunbartonshire, died after taking one of the tablets at Glasgow 
nightspot The Arches on February 1.

Today, warnings issued about the red pills following Miss MacColl's death were renewed.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul 
Livingstone, of Coatbridge Police Office, said: 'The two youths aged 16 
and 17 remain in Monklands Hospital after taking illegal drugs, 
including what is believed to be ecstasy, possibly a red 'mortal kombat'
 tablet, last night.

'We 
are continuing to work with our partner agencies including health 
officials and medical staff in connection with this investigation.

'At
 this time our priority is to ensure that everyone who was at the house 
party is safe and well and officers are carrying out extensive enquiries
 to trace everyone involved.

'Further
 to previous warnings, I would again strongly advise people to avoid 
illicit drugs as their exact content is unknown and can contain 
dangerous chemicals.

'Users must be aware of these dangers and understand
 the devastating effect they can have.'

Dr Neil Howie, NHS Lanarkshire 
consultant in emergency medicine, added: 'We cannot stress highly enough
 that anyone who takes an illicit drug is putting their health, and 
indeed their life, in jeopardy.

'Users can never actually be sure of what
 they are taking and what the contents are.

'We
 would urge anyone who has taken an ecstasy tablet, and in particular 
mortal kombat, who feels unwell to seek urgent medical advice and 
treatment from their local hospital.

'Early
 warning signs include a feeling of agitation and distress and it is 
important that people are seen as early as possible if they experience 
any of these symptoms.'

Currently, the full ingredients of the so-called Mortal Kombat pill remain unknown, but drug experts have warned it may contain 
another substance called PMA, which was blamed for the deaths of more 
than 10 young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester last year.

PMA is sold in pills costing as little as Â£3 or in a crystal-like form, are sometimes pink and shaped like Love Hearts sweets, or stamped with an 'M'.

The drug often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to ecstasy's main chemical, MDMA.

But the active ingredient in PMA is five times stronger and takes longer to kick in, meaning many revellers take extra pills.

PMA has been linked to multiple deaths, both in the UK and in Canada, Norway and Denmark.

Detective Inspector Debbie Johnstone, of Coatbridge CID, appealed for anyone with information about the supply of illegal mortal kombat drugs to come forward.
