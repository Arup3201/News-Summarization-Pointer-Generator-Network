The ringleaders of one of the country's largest ever banking scams have been jailed after police seized £6.5million in stolen and fake cheques.

Charles Nyongo and Onais Hove led a country-wide team of fraudsters who intercepted cheques in the post before altering the recipient's details to steal cash.

The men, who are both 43, were jailed for nine years each at Bradford Crown Court after the seizure of more than 3,000 fake cheques - the largest haul ever recorded by the banking industry.

The court heard how the criminals, from Leeds and Hove respectively, intercepted cheque books and reproduced their pages after creating templates for different banks. 

They would photograph a page in the middle of the book and duplicate the details before posting the book on again to its intended recipient to evade suspicion. 

By the time the account holder had reached the page in their cheque book where the fraudsters started, they would likely have moved on to a new target. 

Hospices, schools and elderly, vulnerable people were among victims of the scam which started in Scotland before spreading across the UK.

Charles Nyongo and Onais Hove stole post intended for schools, hospices and elderly people to defraud them. 

Once they picked up a cheque intended for the recipient, the gang altered its details to those of a third part or 'mule account' which they had access to but was not set up in their names. 

Alternatively, they would duplicate the pages of a fresh cheque book by taking a photograph of a sheet in the middle of the book and copying it perfectly with their own specialised paper and ink. 

They would then post the cheque books on to the account holder. By the time they reached the spot in the book where the fraudsters had started, they would have moved on to their next target.  

An investigation carried out by the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit found more than 3,000 cheques at addresses across the UK. 

Nyongo and Hove denied conspiring to defraud UK banks and possessing articles for use in fraud, but were found guilty of all charges and sentenced to nine years each in prison. 

Det Chief Insp Perry Stokes, head of the DCPCU, said: 'We have dismantled a highly organised and professional fraud gang - one of the largest of its kind ever seen in the UK.

'As the ringleaders, Hove and Nyongo were ruthlessly indiscriminate in selecting their victims. 

'Their knowledge of the bank cheque system was considerable, and our investigation revealed a series of fraud factories across the country.

'We are delighted to have brought these criminals to justice and to have removed the threat they posed to British banks and their customers.'

The pair were sentenced at Bradford Crown Court (pictured) for nine years each for their crimes
