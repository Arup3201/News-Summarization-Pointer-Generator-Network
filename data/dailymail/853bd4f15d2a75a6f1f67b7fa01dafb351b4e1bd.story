Roy Hodgson asked his players to fly back and think of England as they returned to their clubs with homework assignments after Monday’s 2-0 win in Switzerland.

Hodgson and his coaching team are determined not to lose any positivity from that result before next month’s European Championship qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.

Jack Wilshere has been sent back to Arsenal with video clips of Andrea Pirlo and Javier Mascherano, both experts in the midfield holding role he played for the first time in Basle.

Others have been encouraged to think about their specific roles in England’s new formation and to stay in touch with Hodgson’s coaching team, who know that some — like Wilshere and captain Wayne Rooney — may fill different roles for their clubs.

Wilshere said: ‘We’ve got to do our homework because we don’t get long together.

‘I’ll have to learn in that role but that formation is going to be the way forward and we’ll only get better at it.’

After five winless games and a poor World Cup, spirits have been lifted by two wins in six days — especially by the game in Basle, when Hodgson used a midfield diamond for the first time.

The England boss now wants his squad to be more forceful with their opinions and has introduced players-only meetings where the new generation have their say.

Rooney said: ‘Players speak who wouldn’t (if) coaches are there.’

Second in command: Chelsea centre back Gary Cahill will wear the armband when Rooney is unavailable 

Hodgson believes his forums will not only see players take responsibility off the field but encourage them to do so during a match. In Basle, Hodgson’s three most experienced starters — Rooney, Joe Hart and Gary Cahill — all led by example.

Chelsea centre half Cahill was told he will be the captain if Rooney is ever unavailable, with Hart third in command.

Cahill said: ‘Against Norway was the first time I’d worn the armband. I know it was the last few minutes of a friendly but it still meant a hell of a lot to me.’

Monday’s success also strengthened Hodgson’s hand as he hit out at Harry Redknapp on Tuesday.

The QPR manager claimed players no longer want to play for England after the 1-0 win over Norway but Hodgson said: ‘The thing about these players is they all have a burning desire to play for England. That theory that players care more about their club sides is nonsense. They care about both — as they should.’

After beating the Swiss — on paper their most difficult opponents — England are already looking at potential training camps in France, for the Euro 2016 finals.

Hodgson is determined not to repeat the World Cup blunder of having a hotel 90 minutes away from the training facilities.

The FA released a statement on Thursday after England fans in Basle chanted ‘**** off Scotland, we’re all voting yes’ in reference to next week’s referendum.

England play Scotland in a friendly at Celtic Park in November and the FA are keen to distance themselves from political issues.

Adrian Bevington, managing director of Club England, said: ‘We are working closely with the Scottish FA and taking all usual security precautions. We were pleased that the Wembley fixture in 2013 passed peacefully with over 20,000 Scotland fans adding to the atmosphere of respectful rivalry.’
