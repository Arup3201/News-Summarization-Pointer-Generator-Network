It’s been a busy old month for Thibaut Courtois. From playing a pivotal role for Atletico Madrid as they won La Liga for the first time in nearly two decades, and then finished runners-up in the Champions League to Real Madrid, to trying to decide where his club future lies.

Jose Mourinho is beckoning for him to return to his parent club Chelsea ahead of next season, but first there is the small matter of a World Cup campaign with Belgium.

His clean sheet in Belgium's 1-0 win against Russia was the 100th of his career – a remarkable achievement when you consider he has only just turned 22.

The flamboyant Eden Hazard might be the standout 24-carat piece in Belgium’s ‘golden generation’, but Courtois is arguably just as valuable.

The 6ft 6in shotstopper has reached the milestone in 218 games for club and country, meaning he has kept clean sheets in 45.87% of the games he has played in since making his debut for Genk in the Belgian Jupiler Pro League in 2009.

In comparison, Iker Casillas, considered one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time (regardless of his recent blip in form), had kept 73 clean sheets when he turned 22 in the summer of 2003.

Belgium have still never lost when Courtois has been in the side. That’s 19 games now. Thirteen wins, six draws and zero defeats.

Not bad for a 22-year-old.
