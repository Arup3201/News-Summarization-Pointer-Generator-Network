The scars on this young woman's legs and arms bare the pain of her five year battle with a self-harm addiction that almost claimed her life.

But despite losing most of her teenage years to her mental illness, Lauren Darlington says her scars are now a source of strength as she strives to become a champion body builder.

Just 18 months ago, the 21-year-old from Wollongong, south of Sydney, was lying in a hospital bed after overdosing so badly her heart stopped.

Lauren Darlington, 21, battled a self-harm addiction for five years. She says the scars still visible on her arms are now a source of strength as she strives to become a champion body builder 

It was there she finally found the determination to turn her life around after years of battling her demons.

'I first started when I was 15 - small cuts here and there - and I realised it helped (with the pain),' Ms Darlington told Daily Mail Australia.

'It began to take over my life. I'd sit in class and all I could think about was self-harming. 

'It got to the point where I'd use anything. I used to cut with scissors, I'd break light globes - nothing was out of reach.

'There was one school excursion where my arm was already bandaged – I had the urge to hurt myself so I ripped open old wounds.'

Ms Darlington was hospitalised several times due to self-harm, but every time she was released she would start again.

'I never really dealt with the problem. I suppressed it and put band-aids on, so to speak,' she said.

'I guess at the time it was the only release that showed the pain I was feeling on the inside and outside.'

Ms Darlington was raised by her father from a young age and only saw her mother on the rare occasion, which she says contributed to her addiction. 

'Whenever I saw her she would tell me again and again that I would have depression because she had it,' she said.

'I didn't feel worthy and it just kept getting worse.'

She ended up dropping out of school because she was spending so much time in hospital and admits her relationships suffered as a result. 

Her severe overdose 18 months ago was the turning point. 

'It was a few days after my 20th birthday and I lived by myself. I was sitting there crying and nothing would help (with the pain). I just thought I'd had enough,' she said. 

Ms Darlington overdosed with sleeping tablets and said she could feel she was losing control right away.

'My best friend was the only one with a key to my place and I panicked because I didn't want her to be the one to find me. I texted her saying 'help' and ran to the bathroom to make myself sick,' she said.

'I woke up three days later to find my dad crying and begging me to stop.

'I wanted to kill myself. I know it was my intention, but deep down I knew I couldn't do it because I would never have sent the text to my friend. 

'I initially stopped for everyone else, but now it's because I don't want to (self-harm).'

The 21-year-old immediately turned to body building and first started competing just six months after she was released from hospital

Lauren says she overwhelmed when she looks at how far she has come in just 18 months considering she believed she was broken beyond repair

Ms Darlington immediately turned to body building and first started competing just six months after she was released from hospital. 

She entered three shows last year and is a few weeks out from her next competition.

'There are photos of me on stage and my scars are showing. It's empowering that my body is now a sign of strength,' Ms Darlington said. 

'It blows me away. I'm finally at a point where I can look back and say I'm proud of where I am now. I'm a completely different person. I truly thought I was broken beyond repair.'

'I'm so passionate now about doing everything I can because I essentially wasted five years of my life.' 

The 21-year-old now uses her Instagram profile to show her transformation in the hope of inspiring others who may be in a similar situation 

Lauren said there were photos of her on stage competing with her scars showing, but it was empowering that her body is now a sign of strength

Ms Darlington said people now question if she has just replaced one addiction with another in terms of her body building.

'But I assure you I've never seen competing and body building as anything but a positive change in my life,' she said.

'I am now apart of a strong, empowering team of girls which has given me a sense of belonging which I haven't had before.'

She said her coach, Asher Prior, has given her the support, encouragement and guidance she has needed. 

Ms Darlington uses her Instagram profile to show her transformation in the hope of inspiring others who may be in a similar situation.
