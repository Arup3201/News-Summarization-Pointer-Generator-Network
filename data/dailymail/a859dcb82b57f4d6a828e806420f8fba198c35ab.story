Two men have admitted stealing a Henry Moore sculpture worth up to £500,000 and selling it for a scrap value of just £46.

Liam Hughes, 22, and 19-year-old Jason Parker, from Coltsfield, Essex, both pleaded guilty to stealing the sundial sculpture and the sculpture's bronze plinth at St Albans Crown Court.

The Sundial, created by Moore in 1965 as a working model for a larger sculpture, was taken from the grounds of the Henry Moore Foundation in Much Hadham, Herts, overnight between July 10 and 11.

Guilty: Two men have admitted stealing this Henry Moore sculpture from his foundation in Hertfordshire. The sculpture was valued at up to £500,000 but the pair sold it for just £46 scrap value

The sculpture's bronze plinth was also taken overnight on between July 15 and 16 this year.

Hughes and Parker, both of pleaded guilty to two counts of theft when they appeared at St Albans Crown Court yesterday.

Prosecutor Ann Evans said: 'These two items were stolen on 
separate occasions by these defendants and taken to a scrap dealer. He 
paid £46 for the sundial and £200 for the plinth.

'These defendants had no idea what the sculpture was worth. When they
were arrested by the police they said they had found the items in a 
ditch near Tesco.

'Clearly the sculpture is priceless. The director of the foundation 
values it between £250,000 and £500,000. Henry Moore in his will said no
cast of the work could be created, so there was great joy when it was 
returned because it could never have been replaced.

'The scrap dealer also had no idea what it was worth. He thought it 
was attractive and was going to give it to his mother as a present.

Stolen: This reclining figure statue by Moore was taken in 2005 from the Much Hadham site. Its theft prompted a security review at the site

The bronze artwork was found after a televised appeal for information.

The Sundial is among a string of works by the abstract artist, who died in 1986 aged 88, to be targeted by thieves in recent years.

The Henry Moore Foundation carried out a security review following the theft of the two-ton Reclining Figure in December 2005.

In 2010, Moore's £45,000 painting Three Reclining Figures On Pedestals was one of three works of art worth a combined £230,000 stolen from a gallery in Broadway, Worcestershire.

Hughes and Parker, were bailed to reappear at Luton Crown Court on December 4 for sentencing.
