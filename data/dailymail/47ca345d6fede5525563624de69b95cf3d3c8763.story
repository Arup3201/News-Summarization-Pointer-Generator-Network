A tiny new species of animal dubbed the 'water bear' has been discovered living in Antarctica - and it's so tough it can survive in space.

Scientists found the creature - a member of the tardigrade family - on a trip to Victoria Land some 3,500 miles (5,600km) south of Australia.

A number of them, no bigger than half a millimetre, were lurking on mosses within a crater hollowed out by ancient glaciers.

Not such a cuddly bear: Scientists found the creature - a member of the tardigrade family - on a trip to Victoria Land some 3,500 miles south of Australia

Tardigrades, or water bears, are water-dwelling micro-animals with eight legs.

The tiny creatures are certainly strange-looking with their eight chubby legs, little claws and probing heads.

These bears are less than 1mm long and are found in the sea, in fresh water and on land.

Some experts have compared their shape with jelly babies or moles but tardigrades they should not be judged by their 'cute' appearance.

They are virtually indestructible - they will not die even if they are boiled, frozen, squeezed under pressure or desiccated.

In fact, they can be completely dried out for years - and then spring back to life as if nothing had happened.

Members of the tardigrade family have been found in high mountains, hot deserts and the deep ocean - and now in Antarctica.

Members of the tardigrade family have been found in high mountains, hot deserts and the deep ocean - but never in Antarctica.

And they're so resilient to harsh environments they've even been exposed in space by astronauts - and remarkably survived the experience.

The water bear is the only kind of creature known that can survive in the vacuum of space.

The widespread and ancient microscopic animals, found in moss and lichen, feed on plant cells or small invertebrates.

But they can survive the rigours of Antarctica because they have also been tested with extremes of cold, heat, pressure, dehydration, poison and radioactivity.

Their examination under an electron microscope revealed various unusual features - including its red-orange body colour and cushions behind its claws (pictured). There was also a distinctive pattern of hairs on its body - suggesting the scientists were dealing with a new species

Dr Sandra McInnes of the British 
Antarctic Survey, who helped verify the find, said: 'Under the 
microscope they are slow walkers but they look like bears walking.

'They have four pairs of legs but they can hold their back tow legs down and arch themselves up to reach things.

'The cone-shaped mouth has a little hole in the middle for food and it has two eyes which can sense light too.

'Their muscles help them manipulate their claws like a human hand being opened and drawn back in again and they look rather like an armadillo.

'But if you can imagine any environment, you will probably find a tardigrade there - they have an incredible resistance.

'They've been tested in space, under liquid nitrogen, put under pressure and had chemicals thrown over them but they're fine after being washed in water.

'Researchers even breed from the ones that were sent into space on European and American Agency missions.'

Researchers led by Dr Roberto Guidetti from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy found the new creature while on a trip to Victoria Land.

Their examination under an electron microscope revealed various unusual features - including its red-orange body colour and cushions behind its claws.

There was also a distinctive pattern of hairs on its body - suggesting the scientists were dealing with a new species.

Further studies are to be carried out to determine how these new features benefit the animal but it is the furthest south a member of this tardigrade genus has ever been found.

It was already known to be present in large swathes of South America and Tasmania.

Dr McInnes added: 'It doesn't seem to travel well so it's quite an unusual genus to find a new member of, particularly in Antarctica where there are relatively few good tardigrade habitats.'
