Alan Irvine became the second managerial casualty in the Premier League when he was sacked as West Bromwich Albion head coach on Monday night.

Former Stoke manager Tony Pulis is set to be named the club's new boss on New Year's Day after he rejected the chance to join managerless Newcastle.

With things all change at the Baggies, what type of player is likely to be targeted by the new manager in the January transfer window?

What are West Brom looking for?

Anticipate a busy January transfer window. Plans were already being put in place to bring in a number of players while also shifting some out. As many as four for four.

Sebastian Blanco, Jason Davidson, Chris Baird, and Georgios Samaras are available to clubs.

Chairman Jeremy Peace has spoken of preferring a 22-man squad, so there will be a balance struck. With Tony Pulis set to arrive there is likely to be even greater change. 

He will have his own clear ideas but West Brom have prioritised a new, mobile striker and want pace in wide areas, on either flank. Another full-back would be welcome too.

Blackburn winger Ben Marshall is a player that West Brom have shown an interest in and could be available for £3million, while Wigan's Callum McManaman is a more expensive option.

How much do they have to spend?

Prior to the change in head coach, West Brom were primarily looking at loan deals, short-term fixes to boost the squad. January is a notoriously difficult month to find value and rarely have the club spent big.

But Pulis’s arrival could change that. He is likely to be given cash to bring in players he feels will enhance West Brom’s chances of staving off relegation. Given the cost of dropping to the Championship, that could be as much as £10m.

What players Tony Pulis likes to buy

Steven Caulker and Gylfi Sigurdsson were the two players Pulis wanted at Crystal Palace, only for each to move to Queens Park Rangers and Swansea respectively. Both are composed ball-players, so expect that theme to run through. West Brom could do with a cultured No 10 and a young centre-back as it happens.

In his final summer at Stoke, Pulis brought in the likes of Steven N’Zonzi and Geoff Cameron – so a midfielder of stature could also be on his wanted list. West Brom probably need more power to their game.

Saido Berahino's goals have dried up with the 21-year-old failing to find the target in his last 11 appearances

Hopes for the rest of the season…

Simple: stay up. That will rely mainly on their ability to improve their goalscoring. West Brom have been pretty good defensively – apart from at set pieces, something Pulis will look to remedy – keeping six clean sheets.

But with Saido Berahino’s goals drying up it is difficult to see where they win games. Record signing Brown Ideye, who cost £9m, has proved woefully short of Premier League level. Finding a reliable centre-forward is paramount.

Brown Ideye has only scored twice since moving to West Brom in the summer for £9m
