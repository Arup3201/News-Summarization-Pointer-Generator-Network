This is the incredible moment a 100ft jet of water shot into the sky after technicians accidentally punctured a water main.

The high pressure water rocketed into the air in Malden Fields in Bushey, Hertfordshire - sending stones, litter and other debris sky high.

It was let loose by technicians from Affinity Water, who had been carrying out work on the mains pipe.

Powerful: The 100ft jet of water shot into the sky after technicians accidentally punctured a water main

Breathtaking: The high pressure water rocketed into the air in Malden Fields in Bushey, Hertfordshire

It is believed that a build-up of high pressure caused the 21-inch pipe to rupture.

Shocked locals caught the jet of water on camera as it burst out of the main at about 3pm yesterday.

It blasted into the sky, before crashing to the ground - sending water gushing through the surrounding streets.

Resident Harry Jonson, 66, said he and his neighbours were told to stay indoors to avoid being injured by the enormous jet.

'I looked at my window and saw a massive water spurt, just like a fountain,' he said. Â

'We were told to stay indoors as the water was so powerful it was blowing rocks into the air.

'I've never seen anything like it before.'

A fire crew from Watford Fire Station were called to the scene to try to control the burst pipe.

Today, an Affinity Water spokesman said: 'We would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to customers by a burst 21-inch raw water main.

'As the pipe was carrying "raw" untreated water, no customers have had their supply affected and no traffic management has been required whilst repairs take place.

'We would like to thank our customers for their patience while we carry out these repairs.'

The spokesman added that repairs were expected to be completed today.
