Thousands of strangers - including Carrie Underwood and Elijah Wood - saved the birthday of a 13-year-old boy with Asperger's syndrome by sending him well wishes and presents after learning that no one from his school had RSVP'd to his party. 

After Odin Camus, from Ontario, Canada, learned that he wouldn't have any friends coming to his birthday celebration last Friday, his mom Melissa asked members of a local Facebook group to text her teenage son on his new cell phone to help lift his spirits. She also created a Facebook event for his bowling alley birthday party and welcomed anyone who wanted to come.

Not only did Odin receive more than 5,000 'happy birthday' text messages and calls from around the world, he was also joined at his party by hundreds of people who kindly showered him with presents.
