A drug dealer who served five years in prison and left his wife and children for another woman has been allowed to stay in Britain because of his right to family life.

Jamaican Richard Blackwood, 36, was jailed for five years for dealing cocaine and heroin to undercover police in Sussex in 2007. But he fought off an attempt to deport him because his family’s human rights were ‘not being respected’.

An immigration appeal found an earlier tribunal had not properly considered the detrimental effect deporting him would have on his mistress and their child.

Jailed: Blackwood was given five years for dealing Class-A drugs including heroin but was allowed to stay in the country

It did not mention the impact on his abandoned first family. Foreign criminals who serve lengthy prison terms are normally automatically deported but this case will increase concerns over the ease with which many use European Convention on Human Rights legislation to stay in the UK.

Blackwood arrived in the UK in 2002 on temporary visa but in 2006 was granted leave to remain because he had married Carmel, a British woman, with whom he had two children. 

Yet shortly after his marriage three years earlier, he had begun an affair with Melissa Miller from Hove, East Sussex.

After his arrest in 2007, Lewes Crown Court heard he had made £81,000 from drug dealing, which he spent on cars, jewellery and travel. He pleaded guilty to eight drug trafficking charges and one of money laundering.

On release, Blackwood did not return to live with his wife in the Midlands but moved in with Ms Miller, their four-year-old daughter and her other child, aged eight. The Home Office ruled he should be deported to Jamaica.

When Blackwood challenged this, a judge rejected his appeal, but he took his case to the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber and won.

Alp Mehmet, of the Migration Watch, said: ‘This is another example of the rights of the individual who has committed crimes being prioritised over the rights of the community in which he has offended.’

Blackwood could not be contacted last night.
