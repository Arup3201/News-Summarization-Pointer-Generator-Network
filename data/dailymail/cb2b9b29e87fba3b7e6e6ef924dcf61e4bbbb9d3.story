Chilling surveillance footage shows a Florida State University graduate entering the school's library and starting a shooting spree - leaving one student paralyzed from the waist down and another critically injured.  

Gunman Myron May is seen calmly walking around the Stozier Library in Tallahassee on November 20 last year in a baseball cap with horrified students running from the library's entrance and staff cowering behind desks.

The 31-year-old had already fired one shot at student Jason Derfuss, who was remarkably saved by a book he had stored in his backpack. 

May, who was said to have been suffering from mental health problems at the time, is seen walking over to a desk and firing at two staff members at point blank range. 

Minutes later May walked out and was shot dead by officers on the library steps.

Minutes after the shots were fired, armed first responders were seen flooding the lobby and securing the scene. By this point May had been shot and killed on the steps of the library by waiting officers.

A report filed by the Tallahassee Police department states police opened fire because he made a rotating motion towards them. It also revealed that he had a shotgun and more ammunition in his car. 

May left Farhan 'Ronny' Ahmed paralyzed from the waist down after shooting him three times.

The 21-year-old was studying for his finals at the time when he was hit in the spine. 

Another student, Elijah Velez, 18, was grazed by a bullet as he climbed off his bike. He was treated and released at the scene. 

A report released by the Tallahassee Police Department after they closed the investigation into the shooting states that May sat in classes at FSU in the days leading up to the shooting. 

One student described how a faculty member approached him and asked him if he was a student - causing him to become flustered.  

Calculated: Moments before he was seen calmly walking around the Strozier Library wearing a baseball cap and carrying a pink bag

Finding help: Mr Scott (center) is then seen limping away from the scene with a gunshot wound to the leg 

Health problems: Police confirmed that May, who graduated from the university in 2005, was suffering from mental illness at the time of the shooting

After the deadly shooting police unearthed journals and videos that showed May believed he was being targeted. A former girlfriend also believes that he had developed a severe mental disorder and was taking medication.

May sent a Facebook message to nine former classmates before the shooting that he need help to 'expose' what was happening to him and was sending them packages. 

One was picked up by the FBI when it reached Texas. Officers believe they could contain recordings and notes made by May on a thumb drive.

On his Facebook page, he often wrote biblical verses and made a number of references to Christianity.

His last post, two days before the shooting, read: 'Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. ~ Matthew 5:3.' 

Response: Minutes after May's first shots were fired, armed officers were seen flooding into the library 

Lucky escape: Jason Derfuss was the first person to be hit during May's shooting spree. The bullet was stopped by a book he was carrying in his backpack at the time

Scene: Officers from Florida State University and Tallahassee police departments are seen around the steps where May was shot dead minutes after the shooting spree began
