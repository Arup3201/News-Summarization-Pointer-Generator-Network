A restaurant that claims to be 'family-friendly' has angered regulars after it issued a diktat banning children under eight years old after 7pm.

La Fisheria, in Houston, Texas, which has a colorful cartoon fish as a logo and offers a children's menu, announced its new policy on Monday via its Facebook page.

The post reads: 'After 7:00 pm, people over eight years old only. . .

Family friendly? La Fisheria, in Houston, Texas, has angered regulars after it issued a diktat banning children under eight years old after 7pm

'We are a family friendly restaurant, and we also respect all of our 
customers so we introduce this new policy to the restaurant. Thanks for your understanding.'

The restaurant has also posted a sign on its door reaffirming the policy.

Explaining the decision, La Fisheria executive chef Aguiles Chavez told local news station KHOU 11 that many diners had complained about 'noisy and rowdy' behavior from children in the restaurant.

'We find children that are crying, some kids running under tables, and 
our customers don’t like, he said.

'Seven o’clock is not a time for
children, especially when we serve drinks and wine.'

The Facebook post sparked a strong reaction from locals, generating over 400 comments.

And while some customers have welcomed the new rule, others are furious.

One comment on the La Fisheria Facebook page read: 'Wow that's a good one. You can't be "family friendly" if you don't allow
all families to participate. And you can't respect "all" your customers
if you tell "any" of your customers they can't dine at a certain time.'

Another read: 'I find it ironic they say family friendly, when the new rule is anything but that.'

Some
commenters feel is is important to expose youngsters to a formal dining
environment, and La Fisheria denies them that opportunity.

'So, kids can't eat 
dinner at a normal time? They're not senior citizens,' argued one. 'I could understand after 9pm, but I think
it's important to show my child that there is culture and learning 
experiences in cuisine that stretches beyond chain restaurants.'

One critic also queried how the restaurant plans to enforce such a rule: How can you differentiate between a 
small 9 and 10 year old and a tall 6 or 7 year old?' they wrote. 'Are parents now 
required to bring their child's birth certificate with them to verify 
age? Will servers now be required to make an intelligence and speech 
assessment?'

A large number of local diners were in favor of La Fisheria's decision though. Indeed, its Facebook post generated over 400 'likes', and many were from parents with young children.

'I think crying babies can ruin the 
entire meal for anyone close by, and unruly children can, too. I agree 
with this restaurant totally'

One commenter wrote: 'I have three children under the age of 
eight and I think you have a great idea! My kids should not be out at a 
restaurant after 7pm anyway, and if I happen to get a night free with my
husband, I appreciate the "calm and quiet" that a kid-free environment 
brings.'

Another said: 'I think crying babies can ruin the entire meal for anyone close by, and unruly children can, too. I agree with this restaurant totally.'

And even a former restaurant worker weighed in: 'I am a mom of a now 13 and 16 year old, they too get annoyed with children that can't behave in public! I have been in the food and beverage industry for over 20 years and this policy is a God send! One of my pet peeves is poorly raised children.'

And indeed Mr Chavez says that feedback in the restaurant has been positive.

'When we explain, they say you’re right, at the end of the day, you’re thinking of us,' he said.

La Fisheria says it will continue to serve its kids' menu until 7pm, then customers may dine in a child-free environment until the 10pm closing time.
