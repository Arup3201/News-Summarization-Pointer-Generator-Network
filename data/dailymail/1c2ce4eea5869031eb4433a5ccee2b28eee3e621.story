The newly-released calendar from the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium where a toddler was mauled to death earlier this month features pictures of the African painted dogs that killed him.

Two-year-old Maddox Derkosh died after falling from a wooden railing into a pit of the dangerous predators on November 4. He bled to death after he was mauled by the animals, a medical examiner said.

Zoo chiefs decided to send the 2013 calendars out because many had already been collected by supporters before Maddox died, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review said.

Beast: Pittsburgh Zoo has sent out calendars featuring the dogs that killed toddler Maddox Derkosh just weeks after the death

Victim: Maddox Derkosh, two, was killed after falling 11 feet into the dog pit at the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium.

Deadly hunters: Zoo chiefs decided to release the calendars despite the tragic death

Zoo president Barbara Baker said scrapping the calendars, which were printed months ago, was considered.

'We wrestled with that one quite a bit,' she told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. 'We had the calendars available before the accident occurred.

'African painted dogs are a wonderful endangered species,' and despite the tragedy, 'they are animals that we’re responsible for taking good care of.'

She added that the thoughts and prayers of zoo staff was with the family.

The calendar, titled The Color of Nature, features the dogs in March and has four photographs of them with accompanying text.

Their exhibit remains closed. Officials said they would quarantine the animals for a month.

Zoo president and CEO Barbara Baker said staff wrestled with the idea of releasing the calendar, but decided to go ahead as many copies had already made their way into the hands of zoo patrons

Where: This is the overlook platform where two-year-old Maddox fell into the dog enclosure. He bounced off the net, which is there to save small items like cameras and phones

Staff did not say whether the calendar would be sold at the gift shop, but the newspaper says there is a $14.95 price printed on the back cover.

About 800 people attended Maddox’s funeral on November 9.

“We
did discuss it, and we looked at it, but we decided to go forward with 
it,” Baker said. “African painted dogs are a wonderful endangered 
species,” and despite the tragedy, “they are animals that we’re 
responsible for taking good care of.”

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and the child” Baker said.

Desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers 
and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as 
they savagely attacked the two-year-old.

Baker said there is a net below the rail, 
but the boy bounced off it and into the enclosure.

She said the animals attacked the 
child so quickly that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers 
arrived seconds later, they determined it would have been futile to try 
to rescue the child.

Authorities said that zoo staff and 
then police responded 'within minutes' but visitors described that time 
as being filled with screams for help.

Zookeepers called off some of the dogs, and seven of them immediately went to a back building.

The African wild dog is an endangered species which typically roams the open plains and sparse woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa.

The dog's Latin name Lycaon pictus means 'painted wolf' because of the animal's patchy colored coat of red, black, brown, white and yellow fur, each with their own unique pattern.

These dogs are very social, and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members. In fact after a successful hunt, the dogs regurgitate meat for those that remained at the den.

They hunt in packs of six to 20 and despite their small size they prey on large animals like antelopes and wildebeests.

They kill the larger prey by disemboweling, a technique 
that is rapid but has caused this species to have a negative, ferocious 
reputation.

They are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their domestic animals and are susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals.

Its large teeth allow it to consume a lot of bone in the same way a hyena does and it has a bite force quotient - BFQ, the strength of bite relative to the animal's mass -  measured at 142, the highest of any carnivore, except for the Tasmanian devil.

They are extremely aggressive and nearly 80 per cent of their hunts end in a kill - as opposed to a lion with a success rate of just 30 percent.

There were once approximately 500,000 African wild dogs in 39 countries, and packs of 100 or more were not uncommon. Now there are only about 3,000-5,500 in fewer than 25 countries

Three more eventually were drawn away
from the child and one especially aggressive dog refused to back down and stop attacking 
the boy.

It was shot dead by an officer.  Experts said the death is highly unusual. It is the first death in the zoo's history.

The dogs are currently in quarantine, but they will not be euthanised.

Steve Feldman, a spokesman for the 
Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said no one he's spoken to can recall
any deaths of children at an accredited zoo over the last 40 years or 
more.

Feldman said the Pittsburgh Zoo 
successfully completed its five-year review in September, which means it
meets or exceeds all safety standards.

The so-called painted dogs are about 
as big as medium-sized domestic dogs, and 37 to 80 pounds, according to
the zoo.

They have large, rounded ears and dark brown circles around 
their eyes and are considered endangered.

The attack happened in a 1.5 acre 
exhibit called the Painted Dog Bush Camp that's part of a larger open 
area where elephants, lions and other animals can be seen.

Visitors walk
onto a deck that is glassed on the sides, but open in front where the 
roughly four-foot railing is located.

In May, some of the dogs crawled 
under a fence and escaped into a part of the exhibit that's usually 
closed. The zoo was on lockdown for about an hour as a precaution.

Kraus said there was nothing to prevent visitors to the painted dog exhibit from jumping into the exhibit area. He described the accident as 'horrific'.

'Unfortunately,
the dogs were in pack mentality and not responding to zookeepers' 
efforts to control them,' the zoo said in a statement.

Emergency: ThePittsburgh Zoo's entrance is seen after the young boy was killed after falling into the exhibit around noon

Lock-dock: The zoo immediately closed and patrons were hurried inside buildings during the attack

Deadly: The dogs, which are smaller than Labrador retrievers, can be dangerous on their own but are deadly killers when hunting in packs

Uncertainty: A security guard closes the gate to the park, which was temporarily closed immediately after the tragedy

In May, 200 patrons were rushed inside buildings and the zoo was put on lock-down when nine of the dogs sneaked out of the exhibit and found its way into a secondary holding pen.

Alone, the dogs, which weigh up to 80 pounds, can be formidable, but in packs they are vicious -- capable of hunting and killing prey many times their size.

They have been known to kill wildebeest and zebras, though they usually pursue less dangerous prey.

The dogs, which are endangered, are among the most deadly predators of the Serengeti Plain.

Their hunts end in a kill 80 per cent of the time. Lions have a success rate of just 30 per cent.
