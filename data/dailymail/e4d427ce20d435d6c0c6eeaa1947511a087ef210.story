Esther McVey now attends Cabinet as the Employment Minister

Unemployed young people are being put off even trying to find work because of the ‘morally reprehensible’ doom and gloom spread about the jobs market by Labour, the employment minister has said.

Esther McVey said there are ‘more than enough’ businesses willing to give young people a chance.

But she said jobless youths are giving up before they even start to look for work because of the ‘relentless negativity’ about their prospects.

Miss McVey, 46, who previously said young people should be prepared to take lowly jobs in coffee shops if they want to get on in life, said jobseekers should be more optimistic about their chances.

She told the Mail: ‘For too long now, young people have been subjected to relentless negativity about the state of the workplace that is waiting for them when they finish their study, training or apprenticeship.

‘I meet with thousands of young people a year and they all say the negative picture painted by opposition politicians about young people and their bleak future has a very negative effect on them.

‘It saps their confidence and energy before they even look for the job and crushes their spirit so much that it forces them to give up trying.

‘Such wrong and negative information for political gain is morally reprehensible. This affects people's whole lives and futures.’

Miss McVey said that young people should be encouraged and given guidance on how to find work, rather than be put off by negativity.

She said: ‘Many people who should know better insist on talking down young people’s chances, rather than putting their effort into doing all they can to help them build up the experience and skills they need for the employers of the future.

‘We want to build a better future for our young people - not destroy it for them with misinformation.’

‘One thing is clear from the employers I’ve visited is that there are more than enough businesses willing to give young people a chance.'

Miss McVey added: ‘Young people should get to hear from more voices like these - rather than having their hopes drowned out by those peddling damaging myths.

‘The truth is, youth employment is up, there are fewer young people out of work than at the election and young people deserve credit for having weathered the great recession better than previous generations of young people before them.’

The latest official quarterly figures published last week showed the number of jobless young people fell by 102,000 to 767,000 in June. The numbers are also 206,000 lower than the previous year.

Labour has criticised the government’s record on youth unemployment and accused the government of ‘abandoning a whole generation’.

At the start of the government’s reforms, shadow business minister Iain Wright said: ‘There is little prospect of hope for young people if the Government continues on its present course.’

Earlier this year shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said youth unemployment was an ‘injustice for the individuals whose life chances have been stolen’.

Labour had said it would introduce a ‘jobs guarantee’ scheme for jobless youngsters.

Unemployment is falling across the country - but remains stubbornly high in the North East, Yorkshire, the North West and even London

Under the plan, 18 to 24-year-olds out of work for a year would be offered a taxpayer-funded job for six months - with those who refuse losing benefits.

Earlier this year, Miss McVey vowed that tackling youth unemployment would be her ‘top priority’ but said that those looking for work have to be prepared to get a foot on the ladder before expanding their horizons.

Asked if they should be prepared to take ‘entry-level jobs’, she said: ‘Absolutely. You could be working at Costa. But in a couple of years’ time you might say, “I’d like to manage the area” or might even want to run a hotel in Dubai.’
