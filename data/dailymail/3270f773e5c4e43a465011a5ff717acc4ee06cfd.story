A Libyan headmaster yesterday told how he was the real target of the assassin who gunned down WPc Yvonne Fletcher.

Dr Adel Almansouri was shot in the leg in the hail of bullets that felled WPc Fletcher, standing near him outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984.

He said: 'The bullet that killed her was meant for me. Yvonne Fletcher saved my life.'

Dr Almansouri was an 18-year-old student on a scholarship from Libya, and had decided to take part in the London protest against Colonel Gaddafi.

Killed: WPC Yvonne Fletcher was only 25 when she was shot outside the Libyan Embassy in London

Speaking for the first time about the
fateful morning, Dr Almansouri, now 46, said: 'That shooter hit eleven 
of us, ten Libyans and WPc Fletcher.

'She
was the one who died. But I do not believe the killer was aiming for 
her. He was shooting at the Libyan protesters, not the British police.'

Dr
Almansouri is now the headmaster of the International School of 
Benghazi, the eastern city that rose up against Gaddafi last year and 
sparked the revolution.

He established the private college in October, the same month the tyrant was finally captured and executed.

Twenty-eight years after the shooting, Dr Almansouri still bears a scar on his upper right thigh from the bullet wound.

Recalling
the final moments of WPc Fletcher's life, he said: 'She can't have been
more than six feet away, standing directly between me and the embassy.

'And
she had a big smile on her face. I remember that smile very well.' He 
told The Times newspaper: 'Moments after seeing that smile, I heard the 
sound - an automatic machinegun firing. Everyone was panicking, jumping 
on top of one another.

'I felt something warm in my leg. The police were yelling at us: "Run, ******* run!" I tried to move but instead I fell. That's when I realised they'd hit me too.' Dr Almansouri attended the protest, in St James's Square, Central London, after hearing about it and deciding it was important to be there.

He said: 'We were all very 
frightened. We knew that if anyone from the embassy recognised us, then 
not only our own lives, but those of our families back in Libya could be
in danger.

'But we felt 
even more strongly about what Gaddafi was doing, about the persecution 
and murder of political prisoners, and the total absence of democracy, 
so we decided to go.'

After recovering from his injuries, Dr Almansouri went on to gain his PhD from Loughborough University in 1997.

Now living in Benghazi, he stood 
unsuccessfully in local council elections this month, though does not 
mind that he failed to win.

He said: 'I am just grateful to have had
the opportunity to have exercised my democratic rights at all, which I 
wouldn't have done had it not been for Yvonne Fletcher.'

WPc Fletcher, 25, was shot dead while policing the protest. The gunman, shooting from a window in the embassy, was never identified.

Scotland Yard has reopened the murder inquiry with the help of Libya's National Transitional Council, after years of being rebuffed by the Gaddafi regime.

Earlier this month, two detectives from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command flew to Tripoli to hold talks with the country's chief law officer.

The trip was the first in recent years and raises new hope of solving the killing of the officer.

Scotland Yard said it hoped its 'preliminary discussions' would pave the way for the Met and Libyan authorities to work together to identify the assassin.
