Music mogul Simon Cowell has ditched Max Clifford as his PR advisor after the publicist was found guilty of a string of indecent assaults.

Clifford, 71, has worked for Cowell, 54, for over a decade, representing him in the media and handling his public image.

But the pair have reportedly parted company following Clifford's conviction on eight counts of indecent assault at Southwark Crown Court yesterday.

Simon Cowell has employed Max Clifford as his PR adviser for years, but has cut ties with him after the publicist's convictions for indecent assault yesterday

A source told the Sun that Cowell was 'horrified' by what the court heard during Clifford's three-week trial and is now 'distancing' himself from his former PR man.

Despite the split, Clifford's company, Max Clifford Associates, was still using a picture of Cowell on its website this morning before the whole site was taken down around midday.

The website claimed: 'Clifford's unique combination of protection and publicity helped cement [Cowell's] place as one of the world's most successful music/TV moguls in the world.'

Clifford's company website also featured a photo of him with Olympic cyclist Chris Hoy, although the site listed Hoy among the firm's 'past clients'.

It was reported yesterday that Clifford, who during the trial had boasted to the jury of his charity work, had been axed as patron of two organisations near his home in Hersham, Surrey.

Shooting Star Chase children's hospices and Woking and Sam Beare Hospices have both said Clifford is no longer a patron of their charities.

A spokesman for Shooting Star Chase said: 'Max Clifford became a patron of Shooting Star Chase childrenâ€™s hospice in 2011.

'Prior to this, he was a supporter of CHASE hospice care for children. Safeguarding the children and families supported by Shooting Star Chase is of upmost importance.

'None of our patrons have unsupervised access to the children or young people and all staff with access to children under go Disclosure and Barring Services checks.

'Furthermore all staff are required to attend a yearly mandatory safeguarding children training session.

'In light of Mr Clifford being found guilty of indecent assault, Shooting Star Chase can confirm that Mr Clifford is no longer a patron of the charity.'

Cowell is believed to have first hired Clifford when he became a TV judge on the Pop Idol TV series in 2001.

It is believed the music boss was treated as one of the firm's top clients, whose public image was handled exclusively by Clifford himself.

The relationship helped see Cowell become a huge TV personality, with the public growing to love to his cruel comments and put downs to fame-hungry contestants.

Cowell even featured a film by Louis Theroux in 2002, when the documentary-maker followed Clifford for a BBC Two programme.

Max Clifford has spent at least 12 years handling Simon Cowell's deals with the media

Cowell and Clifford were seen talking at an event organised by Clifford for children at the Royal Marsden Hospital in west London.

But Clifford admitted he was 'disappointed' when his most high-profile client revealed in a biography that he had an affair with fellow TV judge Dannii Minogue.

Clifford, who had spent years protecting the secret, described Cowell's decision to reveal the affair as a 'massive own goal'.

He said at the time: 'This is a man who for 10 years I protected and always was desperately, desperately keen to have a private life and keep his private life very private.

'We've had a close relationship for many, many years, I think the world of the guy.'

Despite Clifford's arrest by Operation Yewtree detectives in December 2012, Cowell continued to use him to handle his publicity.

The PR expert's empire began to crumble as one of his victims told of her joy that justice had finally caught up with him. 

The victim, who Clifford was found guilty of indecently assaulting, was groped when she went to his office as an aspiring teenage model in the 1980s.

She told the Sun: 'I'm delighted he has finally been exposed. Now the world knows the real Max Clifford.

'He is a predatory, manipulative, monster who thought he could take what he wanted from young, vulnerable women."

The woman, now in her late 40s, said Clifford told her she 'couldn't be shy in this industry' before launching himself at her.

As with other women involved in the case, Clifford promised her fame and told her he could get her a role in a Bond Film, name dropping famous producer 'Cubby' Broccoli.

The victim told the paper she was traumatised after the attack and stayed indoors for days.

She added: 'I was terrified of other agents after that. I got one really lucrative job but didn't turn up for it because I was so scared.

'When I heard the verdict I wept tears of sadness.'

After being charged with 11 counts of indecent assault, he was found guilty of eight yesterday. He was cleared on two other counts, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on another.

It emerged today that there were 23 victims who came forward to police, but prosecutors decided to proceed with what they perceived to be the seven strongest cases.

Clifford will be sentenced on Friday. The maximum sentence for indecent assault was two years at the time the offences were committed.
