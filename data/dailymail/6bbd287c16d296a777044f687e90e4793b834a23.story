Manchester United were rescued by Phil Jones against Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday night but were not spared a tongue lashing by former hero Roy Keane after yet another lacklustre display at Old Trafford.

On a night where bitter rivals Manchester City came from behind to stun European champions Bayern Munich in Germany, United had to rely on a 67th minute strike to finally break the deadlock against Shakhtar.

And laying into the likes of Rio Ferdinand and Ashley Young for letting down under pressure manager David Moyes, Keane did not pull any punches.

Giving his half-time verdict on ITV, Keane said: 'There has been no reaction from the United players from the disappointment of last week. They don't look like a team, just a collection of individuals running around.

'You can defend players for making mistakes but you cannot defend players for not tackling and not getting close to people.

Under pressure: Manchester United manager David Moyes shouts instructions at his team

'They (United) had a couple of good chances through Ashley Young towards the end of the first half. He should certainly hit the target. I think it sums up his time at Man United, just not good enough.

'David Moyes took the heat off the players before the game by saying it is his responsibility but we are talking about experienced players.

'Rio Ferdinand's decision making, the chances he has taken, it is ridiculous. It is like his debut tonight.

'As we said before the game, there are big question marks over the manager and the players. That for Manchester United is certainly not good enough.'
