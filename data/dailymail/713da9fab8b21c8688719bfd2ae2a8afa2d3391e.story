Peaches Geldof's
 final two posts on Instagram were heartbreakingly tender videos showing 
her bathing her younger son and getting him ready for bed for what would
 be the last time.

Uploaded
 to the social media site the night before she died, the first of the 
short clips apparently taken with her mobile phone show her bathing 
Phaedra, who will be one later this month.

The
 tousle-haired baby is seen giggling with delight in a bath 
filled with toys as his 25-year-old mother plays peekaboo with him.

Happy family moment: Peaches' last two Instagram posts were videos of one of her sons getting ready for bed

Family joy: Peaches wrote in a magazine how she finally achieved happiness by having her two small boys

In the penultimate video posted by Peaches before her death, she shows her little boy giggling in his bath

Intimate moment: The last video Peaches posted showed her son, in dinosaur pyjamas, brushing his teeth

In the second and final
 video, Phaedra is shown in dinosaur print pyjamas on what looks like 
his parents' bed, chewing a toothbrush and playfully saying 'No' to his 
mother as she chats to him in baby-speak and asks 'Are you brushing your
 teeth?'.

They were the 
last posts on her Instagram account, which was followed by more than 
150,000 people and used regularly by Peaches to display thousands of photographs 
of her two sons, musician husband and pet dogs.

Peaches
 posted them to Instagram on Sunday evening after uploading a series of 
photographs taken during a day at their family home in Kent.

One
 of the pictures, showing a psychedelic top and shorts, indicated that 
she was looking forward to dressing her elder boy, Astala, two later this month, for summer.

She wrote: 'Bought Astala a cool summer look!... So cute!  Astala aka Brian Jones...'

In
 a recent interview with Mother & Baby magazine, the last Peaches 
gave, she spoke about how having her two boys had turned her life 
around.

'No!' The little boy, dressed in dinosaur pyjama top and nappy, giggles with delight as Peaches teases him

Peaches wrote in her new magazine column: 'Right now life is good.  And being a mum is the best part of it.'

She said her boys, 
Astala, who will be two later this month, and Phaedra, who will be one also later this month, were 'the best things' in her life.

Peaches,
 whose parents Bob Geldof and Paula Yates split up in 1995 when she was 
six, and whose mother died at the age of 41 from a heroin overdose, said
 she had had a 'rudderless and troubled' childhood.

In an interview with Mother & Baby magazine published earlier this year, she
 said the early days of being a parent had left her 'broken' and crying 
with exhaustion, but revealed that becoming a mother had healed her 
pain.

'Becoming a mother 
was like becoming me, finally,' she said.  'After years of struggling to
 know myself, feeling lost at sea, rudderless and troubled, having 
babies through which to correct the multiple mistakes of my own 
traumatic childhood was beyond healing.

'I
 felt finally anchored in place, with lives that literally depend on me,
 and I'm not about to let them down, not for anyone or anything.'

At peace: Peaches had finally found happiness with her husband, Thomas Cohen, and their two small boys

Peaches used her Instagram account to show off her two little boys - she put this picture up on Sunday night

'So cute': She also posted a photograph of a new psychedelic outfit she had bought for her older boy, Astala

She posted this picture to Instagram with the caption 'Eating my dinner in bed is such hard work, Mama'

Memories: Peaches also put up a photograph of Phaedra looking at old family pictures, saying 'So cute'

Peaches had recently 
been appointed the magazine's new columnist, the 'It Girl turned Earth 
Mother', and in her first column, published shortly before she died, she wrote how she had left her 'life of wanton wanderlust' behind when she had children.

She wrote: 'With fun-loving friends from Los Angeles to London, I was lost in a haze of youth and no responsibilities… But it was becoming boring.

'I wanted an anchor – I craved it.  And when I had two wailing, smiling, joyful little blobs of waddling pink flesh, they became my entire existence and saved me from one of pure apathy.'

Peaches went on to say how having babies meant that her friends, apart from her five closest friends, deserted her, leaving her feeling 'alienated and abandoned', and wondering if she had made a mistake.

She said: 'No-one seemed to want to ask me about my babies, when I wanted to gush endlessly about them.  It hurt me'.

Happy families: One of Peaches' recent posts was of her son Phaedra driving on a miniature toy car

'Happy Easter': Peaches posted this photograph showing her children's handiwork and Easter cards

'Bliss': In her new magazine column, Peaches wrote that life with her two boys had left her 'happier than ever'

But the young mother of two told how she made new friends with children the same age, and how a kiss from her boys made her realise her life was better than ever.

She wrote: 'Phaedy gave me a wet kiss and both collapsed giggling into my arms, looking at me with pure love.  In that magic moment, all my doubts were erased.  Everything else was nothingness and it just…didn’t matter.  I had the perfect life… It was and is bliss.'

She
 used the interview with Mother & Baby to talk about her enthusiasm 
for Attachment Parenting (AP), a school of thought in which parents keep
 their small children close to them at all times, often sleeping in the 
same bed and wearing them in slings (babywearing) during the day.

She
 said her own experience of AP from her nanny in the wake of her 
parents' divorce had 'saved me from losing it', and described it as 
responding to a baby's needs and building bonds through closeness and 
trust.
