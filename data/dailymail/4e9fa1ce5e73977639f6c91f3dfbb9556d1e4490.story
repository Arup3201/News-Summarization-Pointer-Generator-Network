You may know them best for strutting their stuff on the catwalk or starring in hit TV shows and films.

But Cindy Crawford, Ashton Kutcher and Donald Sutherland are among the celebrities who have studied engineering.

The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering in London has shared a list of celebrities with MailOnline to highlight the breadth of appeal of engineering.

The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering has shared a list of celebrities who have studied engineering, including Ashton Kutcher (pictured) with MailOnline, to highlight the breadth of appeal ofthe discipline

For example, Cindy Crawford studied chemical engineering at Northwestern University, Illinois, before taking to the catwalk, while Teri Hatcher, studied mathematics and engineering at De Anza College, California, before playing Lois Lane in The New Adventures of Superman and later, Susan in Desperate Housewives.

Ashton Kutcher studied biochemical engineering. While the subject may have not have prepared him for his acting career - aside perhaps from playing Steve Jobs - it may have stood him in good stead for his interest in tech start-ups.

The actor has so far successfully invested in companies such as Foursquare Skype, Airbnb, Spotify and yPlan.

Swedish Actor Dolph Lundgren who is known for his roles in action movies (a shot from Peacekeeper is shown), has a degree in chemical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, followed by a master's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney in Sydney

Before becoming the 108th Mayor of New York City and a business magnate, Michael Bloomberg studied electrical engineering.

Actor Donald Sutherland, the son of an engineer, studied the same subject and Swedish Actor Dolph Lundgren who is known for his roles in action movies, has a degree in chemical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, followed by a master's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney in Sydney. 

Footballer Dennis Bergkamp studied mechanical engineering at University of Bath

His first big break came in Rocky IV and he has recently starred alongside Sylvester Stallone and other action stars in The Expendables film franchise.

And it is not just actors that set their sights on becoming engineers.

Footballer Dennis Bergkamp studied mechanical engineering at University of Bath, while Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, was a software and telecommunications engineer, before drawing his famous comic strips.

Tom Scholz, founder of rock band Boston, studied mechanical engineering at MIT and holds a number of patents, while Herbie Hancock, a jazz musician, studied electrical engineering.

A number of celebrities have expressed an interest in become more technically-minded too.

For example, Will.i.am has said that he would like to study computer science and has recently launched a smart watch, while model Karlie Kloss, recently participated in ‘Hour of Code’ to encourage people to learn how to create their own computer programmes.

Despite more people keen to build their own apps and a widespread interest in green technology, for example, there is a major shortage of engineers.

In the UK alone, 1.82 million new engineering, science and technology professionals will be needed by 2022, for example.

The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, which has been likened to a ‘Nobel’ for engineering, aims to raise the public profile of engineering.

The £1 million prize has this afternoon been awarded to chemical engineer Robert Langer for his revolutionary advances in the fields of chemistry and medicine.

The 2015 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering has been awarded to the ground-breaking chemical engineer Dr Robert Langer for his revolutionary advances in the fields of chemistry and medicine.

Dr Langer has over 1,000 issued and pending patents, over 200 major prizes to his name, and  is the most cited engineer in history.

A chemical engineer by training, Dr Langer was the first person to engineer polymers to control the delivery of large molecular weight drugs for the treatment of diseases such as cancer and mental illness.

His unconventional thinking toppled the established view that controlled-release drug delivery would not work for large molecules like proteins, which are very sensitive to their surroundings.

Dr Langer's work has helped lay the foundation for a myriad of health innovations, including the long-lasting brain cancer treatment called Giladel Wafer and the prostate cancer and endometriosis treatments Lupron Depot, Zoladex, and Decapeptyl SR.

He is also behind the schizophrenia treatment Respirdal Consta, the diabetes treatment Bydureon and the drug-coated cardiovascular stents that alone have benefited 10 million heart patients.

His laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge - with over 100 students, postdoctoral students, and visiting scientists at any one time - is the world's largest academic biomedical engineering laboratory.

One of Dr Langer’s most recent projects is a microchip-based implant capable of storing and releasing precise doses of a drug on-demand or at scheduled intervals for up to 16 years.

The QEPrize is a global £1million prize that celebrates the engineers responsible for a ground-breaking innovation that has been of global benefit to humanity.

The Queen will present the prize to Dr Langer at Buckingham Palace later this year.
