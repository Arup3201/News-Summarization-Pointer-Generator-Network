At first sight it looks like nothing more than a fallen leaf, brittle and brown with a few insect bites taken out.

But closer inspection reveals that the piece of foliage is in fact a cunningly camouflaged insect which has managed to blend in with its jungle surroundings.

Seconds after its hiding place was disturbed, the animal - a sort of grasshopper known as the leaf katydid - spreads its wings to reveal vibrant autumnal patterns on the inside.

Uncovered: The insect, which was disguising itself against a leaf, revealed its more vibrant wings when disturbed

The insect was found blended into its 
surroundings in the Sipaliwini region of Suirname, a South American 
country north of Brazil.

It was noticed by American photographer Piotr Naskrecki, who took the pictures after making the lucky find as he travelled across the continent.

He said: 'If you ever visit a humid, tropical area in South or Central America you may be rewarded with the discovery of one of the most amazing animals - the leaf katydid.

'The only way to notice them is to look for the movement of their long antennae and legs as they slowly munch on leaves at night.'

Mr Naskrecki added: 'These katydids are probably the best mimics of plants among all insects.

'Look for the antennae': The leaf kaydid

'Their mimicry is by no means restricted to resemblance of plain, green leaves - that would be too easy.

'When the insects fall to the ground, they often play dead when approached by a predator.'

'Their bodies are replicas of leaves that have been chewed up, torn, rotten, dried up, partially decayed, or covered by fungi. But the best part is that no two individuals are alike.'
