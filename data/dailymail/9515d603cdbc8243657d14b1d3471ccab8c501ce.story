This heartwarming video shows the moment a young boy was told he was going to become a big brother for the first time.

10-year-old Ethan was handed a Christmas card by his parents - only to discover that it was no ordinary festive gift.

Inside the card was an ultrasound image of his new brother or sister, along with a message from the unborn baby saying, 'Can't wait to meet you.'

Present: Ethan, 10, was filmed by his parents opening an early Christmas card which contained big news

Ethan, from Scotland, has been asking for a sibling to share the home since he was just two years old, according to his parents.

And when they told him that his dream was finally going to come true, they decided to capture the moment for posterity.

The video, which has been posted on YouTube, shows Ethan about to open an early Christmas card - but baffled as to why he is being filmed.

The card says 'To a wonderful brother' on the front, and has an ultrasound photograph inside, although Ethan does not seem initially to work out exactly what is going on.

Excitement: Ethan has been asking his parents for a younger brother or sister since he was just two

Inside, the boy's parents wrote: 'To my big brother Ethan, have a fantastic Christmas - can't wait to meet you.'

At this point the penny finally appears to drop, as Ethan gasps and then puts his head in his hands, overcome with joy.

He seems to cry with happiness before bursting out in a fit of giggles, saying: 'I can't believe this!'

Ethan's final words are 'Oh gosh' as he struggles to take in the momentous news.

The boy's aunt, Sarah Keeble, told the Mirror: 'This is all he has ever wanted and I'm over the moon for him.'
