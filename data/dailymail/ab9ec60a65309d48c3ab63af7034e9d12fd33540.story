An American treated for Ebola at Emory
University Hospital in Atlanta since Sept. 9 said on Wednesday
he was recovering from the virus and expected to be discharged
from the hospital soon.

The patient, who has not been identified, was working in
Sierra Leone when he tested positive for the disease and was
evacuated to the United States on a privately-chartered flight.

He disclosed the first public details of his condition in a
statement released by Emory but said he wished to keep his
identity secret for now.

The unidentified man who is being treated for Ebola at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia said today that he was getting better and he expected to be released soon

Dallas nurse, Amber Vinson, is due to be flown to Emory on Wednesday from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital after contracing Ebola

'I want to share the news that I am recovering from this
disease, and that I anticipate being discharged very soon, free
from the Ebola virus and able to return safely to my family and
to my community,' the patient said.

The patient said he became critically ill with Ebola
symptoms soon after arriving at Emory and credited his improved
health to 'rigorous medical treatment, skillful nursing and the
full support of a healthcare team.'

'I want the public to know that although Ebola is a serious,
complex disease, it is possible to recover and return to a
healthy life,' the patient said.

Emory was preparing on Wednesday to receive its fourth Ebola
patient, Texas nurse, Amber Vinson, who helped treat Liberian patient Thomas
Eric Duncan, who died of Ebola and was the first person
diagnosed with the virus in the United States.

Two other Americans who contracted Ebola in Liberia were
treated in Emory's isolation unit and released in August. 

Dr Kent Brantly and missionary aid worker Nancy Writebol both recovered from the virus after receiving the experimental serum, Z-Mapp, during their care at Emory.

Dr Brantly then donated blood to Dr Rick Sacra, who was treated at Nebraska Medical and recovered, along with NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who was still being cared for in Omaha.

The doctor offered to donate blood to Thomas Duncan but their blood types did not match. 

Incredibly, Dr Brantly also matched with the first nurse struck down with Ebola, 26-year-old Nina Pham. She is said to be in a good condition today. 

The second nurse to contract Ebola from 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital was being transferred to Emory University Hospital on Wednesday.

Miss Vinson, 29, from Akron, Ohio, was the second nurse in a matter of days to be diagnosed with the deadly virus in Dallas and was described as 'ill but clinically stable' after going to Texas Health on Tuesday with a low-grade fever.

She is set to be flown to Emory in Atlanta, Georgia in quarantine units with staff specially-trained in infectious diseases. Both patients recovered.

Miss Vinson's stepfather, Ronald Schuler, told MailOnline on Wednesday: 'Right now she's doing OK. Her temperature is going down. We don't want to do a lot of talking about it now. She's OK. The main concern is for her to get better.'

It also emerged on Wednesday that the nurse had traveled on Frontier Airlines flight 1143 from Cleveland, Ohio to Dallas-Fort Worth, the day before she was diagnosed, after spending five days in her home state to plan her wedding.

The CDC said the 29-year-old had a temperature of 99.5F - just below the threshold of 100.4F when she boarded the flight. The CDC has asked all 132 passengers to get in touch as an extreme precaution.
