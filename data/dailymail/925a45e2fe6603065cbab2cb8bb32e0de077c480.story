A man has been charged with murder following a brawl outside a wedding reception where a father-of-two died and two others were injured.

Richard Stroud, 46, who it is believed was attending a relative's wedding, died in hospital in the early hours of Sunday following the social club fight.

Fellow guest Matthew Boyd, 32, was charged with murder, grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm after the attack on three men.

Forensic investigators were today still inspecting a cordoned off area outside the Guildford City Social Club in  Surrey.

Tributes: Family have left flowers at the scene saying that Mr Stroud was 'taken from this world too soon'

Mr Stroud's mother Francine told the Evening Standard today: 'We are heartbroken. We don't want to say any more at the moment but I hope they get to the truth. He was a beautiful man'.  

Relatives have left flowers paying their respects at the scene of the death.

One, signed 'your little sister Boo', read: 'You were taken from this world too soon. God help heaven with you and Dabbers reunited.'

Another, written to 'Uncle Richard', read: 'Rest in peace. You will always be in our hearts.'

A bar worker at the club, which remains closed following the fight, said they are 'still trying to get their heads together'.

She said: 'He was at the wedding party that was here. My head's all over the place. It's horrendous.'

Police were called to the scene at around 10pm on Saturday and Richard was taken to St George's Hospital, in Tooting, south London, where he later died.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Rymarz, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, urged witnesses to come forward.

He said: 'This is a tragic incident in which a man has sadly lost his life, our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mr Stroud at this extremely difficult time.'

Boyd was remanded in custody after he appeared at Guildford Crown Court yesterday morning.
