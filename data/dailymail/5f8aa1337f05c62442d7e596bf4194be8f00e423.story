Dutch airline KLM scored a PR own goal last night after tweeting a picture which appeared to mock Mexicans as they celebrated the Netherlands' dramatic last gasp victory in the World Cup.

Within minutes of Holland's 2-1 victory over Mexico, the airline posted a snap on its Twitter feed of an airport departures sign under the heading 'Adios Amigos #NEDMEX'.

The sign also bore a symbol of a moustachioed man wearing a sombrero, sparking accusations of racism from angry Twitter users.

Winner: Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored from the penalty spot deep into injury time, taking The Netherlands into the World Cup quarter finals

The post immediately went viral, with 
A-list Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal using not one but two expletives
 in a 140-character Tweet to tell his two million-plus followers that 
he'll never fly the carrier again.

Amid the widespread protest online, 
the post was pulled a half-hour later without an explanation.

The Y Tu Mamá También actor later apologised for his use of strong language, adding: 'I must say this: apologies to anyone who felt offended by my comments. I was caught by the football bug that spoiled my sense of humor.'

The Dutch had come from a goal down against Mexico in Fortaleza, winning a penalty deep in injury time with the scores level.

Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored from the penalty spot after Mexican captain Rafael Marquez was punished for his foul on Dutch winger Arjen Robben.

Robben's apparent exaggerated reaction to the foul had left a bitter taste for many Mexico supporters, who became further riled when KLM posted its ill-timed tweet, seemingly mocking the losing team.

The result means the Dutch go through to the quarter finals where they will face Costa Rica, while Mexico's World Cup dream is over.

Lifestyle blogger Andy Torres took to Twitter to say: '@KLM I am an Elite+ frequent flyer with 
you guys and I always choose KLM. I'm Mexican and I found your tweet 
condescending and patronizing'.

She added: '@KLM I dont know who runs your social media but I think that was an extremely bad move. Absolutely no respect....Have a good evening.'

Mexico supporter Adina Chelminsky wrote: 'For a trip this summer I had the option of flying @klm or lufthansa. I was undecided. I took the "Adiós Amigos" to heart. Flying Lufthansa.'

Offensive: Twitter user Oscar von Hauske added: '@KLM To whoever in your corporate graphics department decided to create this, let them know you are offensive and you lost a customer'

'It was meant to be a joke,' said KLM spokeswoman Lisette Ebeling Koning, adding that the airline never intended to offend Mexicans, which it serves via a daily direct flight between Mexico City and Amsterdam.

'But there was too much negative reaction.'

Mexican national carrier AeroMexico was quick to react to the upset, itself taking to Twitter to show support for the country's football team under an arrivals sign.

'Thank you for this great championship,' AeroMexico said. 'You've made us proud and we're waiting for you at home.'
