Things may not be going according to plan for Mario Balotelli on the pitch, but he has pledged to put in the hard yards to turn it all around.

The striker, who has yet to score in the Premier League following his Â£16m summer switch from AC Milan, posed with defenders Kolo Toure and Mamadou Sakho at the club's Melwood training ground.

Balotelli posted the picture on Instagram on Friday along with the caption: 'Train hard! Will play hard!!'

Things haven't gone according to plan for Balotelli or Liverpool so far this season

The 24-year-old looks to be on the mend after a hamstring injury, but he will miss his side's clash against Leicester this weekend.

Balotelli would have had to oust Rickie Lambert from the striking role, with the former Southampton man scoring in his last two appearances.

And Sky Sports presenter Gary Neville believes Lambert deserves his place in the team.

'He should be playing 100 per cent ahead of Balotelli,' he told Sky Sports.Â
