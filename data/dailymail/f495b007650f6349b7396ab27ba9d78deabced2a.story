Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's never-ending injury problems plummeted to new low after losing two more players.

The Gunners secured their passage into the Champions League group stages with a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund - but their glee was tempered by injuries to captain Mikel Arteta (calf) and Yaya Sanogo (hamstring).

'The injury situation is a problem because we have many games,' said Wenger.

Arteta and Sanogo will be assessed at the club's London Colney HQ on Thursday to establish the prognosis.

But the Spaniard's loss will spark a change in transfer strategy from the Gunners when the January window re-opens.

Jack Wilshere's ankle injury had already forced Wenger into rethinking his transfer plans.

The Arsenal manager is still prioritising the capture of at least two central defenders; a position the Gunners have been dreadfully short this season.

But, even prior to Wednesday night, Wenger is also now looking to sign a central midfielder to replace Wilshere - who could be out for four months if he needs surgery on his injured left ankle.

Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender remains Wenger's dream signing, but Sportsmail understands they are also showing an interest in Sevilla's Grzegorz Krychowiak, who could be cheaper option.

Their defensive targets include Celtic's Virgil van Dijk, Manchester United's Chris Smalling and Ipswich left-back Tyrone Mings.

But Arteta's injury will only heighten Wenger's desire to sign a new central midfielder when the window re-opens.

Arsenal expect to discover whether or not Wilshere will require surgery when he sees a specialist.

Arteta, Sanogo and Wilshere join an already lengthy Arsenal injury list.

Danny Welbeck (knee), Mesut Ozil (knee), Wojciech Szczesny (hip), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle), Theo Walcott (groin) and David Ospina (thigh) all missed the clash through injury.

Despite the setbacks, Arsenal produced a fine 2-0 win against Dortmund to confirm their place in the last 16 of the Champions League.

On his side's 15th consecutive qualification for the Champions League knockout stages, Wenger added: 'When you work at the football club we realise it's not easy to have that continuity and consistency and I'm very proud of that.

'The club deserves a lot of credit for that. But it's not enough, we want more than that.

'The focus to defend well together. We had a similar game to Saturday (a 2-1 defeat to Manchester United) but we focused really well. It was a committed game, and maybe defensively we were better tonight.

'We have done our job. We want now to focus on the Premier League and to wait now for who we get in the draw.'
