Adrian Ernest Bayley, the sex offender who murdered Jill Meagher, has been found guilty of raping three more women prompting her father to slam the system for failing to protect his daughter.

The brutal rape and murder of the 29-year-old ABC staffer on her way home from a night out in Brunswick in Melbourne's north in September 2012 rocked the entire nation.

His attack on Ms Meagher led to a review of Victoria's parole laws, after he was mistakenly allowed to remain on the streets. 

Ms Meagher's father, George McKeon, said although nothing could bring back his daughter, it was evident from the findings in the report that the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community.

Mr McKeon has spoken out following his daughter's killer, who has been described as deriving pleasure from inflicting pain, being convicted of three more rapes - two sex workers and a Dutch backpacker - bringing his number of victims to 12.

Ms Meagher's murder triggered a parole system review by retired High Court judge Ian Callinan, who released his findings in July 2013.

Bayley was released from prison on parole in 2010, but that should have been cancelled after he was convicted of assaulting a man in February 2012.

Instead he appealed the assault charge and was released on bail, leaving him free to rape the 25-year-old, the backpacker and kill Ms Meagher.

Ms Meagher's father George McKeon said although nothing could bring back his daughter, it was clear from the Callinan report that the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community.

'As a family, we have until now been very mindful not to make any statement or take any actions that might delay the outstanding criminal proceedings against Gillian's murderer,' McKeon said in a statement.

'However now that these proceedings are completed, we want to try and obtain closure and to ensure that other families don't have to endure this trauma.' 

'In particular as a family we would like to:

'A - Continue to raise awareness of the systemic problem of violence against women, an issue we as a family and Tom Meagher, in particular, is very closely associated with in both his writings and his role as an ambassador for the White Ribbon Campaign.

'B - Ensure that the proposed Coronial Inquest into the circumstances of Gillian's death does not proceed. Following the Callinan Report, the 20 May 2013 amendments to The Corrections Act 1986 (Vic) and the criminal proceeding in relation to her murder, we see little to be learned or gained from an open Inquest into her death.'

To add to his string of offences, Bayley has been convicted of raping an 18-year-old sex worker in his car in St Kilda in 2000 and a 25-year-old sex worker in April 2012 in eerily near identical circumstances.

The 43-year-old also raped a Dutch backpacker in July 2012, just two months before his fatal attack on Ms Meagher, after telling her she was in danger and convincing her to climb into his car for safety.

Bayley picked up all three women in St Kilda and drove them to a secluded laneway where he parked with the passenger side door pressed against a fence, blocking their escape.

He contested each charge but juries found him guilty in three separate Victorian County Court trials.

Suppression orders prohibited media outlets from publishing any details from the rape cases until the third guilty verdict was handed down on Thursday.

His defence team argued that the three sexual assault victims had mistaken their attackers for Bayley because he featured heavily in the media spotlight with Ms Meagher's case.

Bayley has now been found guilty of raping 10 women and attempting to rape two more.

He is currently serving a life sentence with a 35-year-minimum for the rape and murder of Ms Meagher in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012.   

Bayley was found guilty of raping the 18-year-old in July 2014, but suppression orders prevented reporting of the case until he faced the two other trials this month.

Judge Sue Pullen lifted the orders when the final jury returned its verdict on the backpacker's case on Wednesday and will sentence Bayley at a later date.

Born Adrian Ernest Edwards on July 14, 1971, he grew up in Melbourne with four younger siblings and an abusive father, who once smashed his son's head through a wall

Ms Meagher's body was found six days after the horrific murder by the hands of Bayley

Born Adrian Ernest Edwards on July 14, 1971, he grew up in Melbourne with four younger siblings and an abusive father, who once smashed his son's head through a wall.

Bayley told a prison psychologist he was also sexually abused from age nine to 15 by an older female, though this claim has not been verified.

'There is certainly evidence of physical abuse - in my opinion, some evidence of the possibility of sexual abuse,' psychologist James Ogloff later told a court.

Professor Ogloff believes Bayley's borderline personality disorder contributes to his impulsiveness and unstable self image.

Bayley fantasises about assuming power and control over his victims, and the psychologist believes he derives pleasure from inflicting pain.

His criminal record suggests this is the case.

FIRST TRIAL: July 2014

Victim raped in late 2000 when aged 18 in a laneway in St Kilda. Bayley put his fingers down her throat so she couldn't breathe and threatened to kill her, the ABC reported. She became addicted to heroin at 14 and turned to sex working to supplement her habit. Bayley was her third and last client.

SECOND TRIAL: March 2015

Another sex worker, aged 25, was told by Bayley 12 years later in April 2012 that she needed a pimp to 'look out' for her while he was raping her in the back of his car. He then drove her to a hotel to use the bathroom when Bayley drove away after she refused to get back in the car.

THIRD TRIAL: March 2015

A Dutch backpacker was beckoned by Bayley to get in his car because he said another car was following her while she was walking from a pub in St Kilda to her home to Balaclava in July 2012. The woman was so fearful of dying while being raped that she invited Bayley back to her place where he took a couple of steps into her house but left when he realised her flatmates were home.

His first rape was committed just months after he walked down the isle, in 1990, and a string of sexual assaults soon followed.

In June 1991, a 19-year-old Bayley was jailed for five years, with a three-year non-parole period, for raping a teenager and attempting to rape two more women. 

He spent almost two years in prison before being released in 1993, when he trained as a pastry chef.

Bayley had two children with his first wife before they split. He married again, fathering another two children.

He changed his last name from Edwards to Bayley in 2000, but returned to violent sexual crime.

In the early 2000s there were reports to police that a young, fit man was targeting prostitutes in St Kilda.

He was jailed again in April 2002 for 11 years, with minimum of eight, for 16 charges of rape against five victims. 

He would drive them to a laneway, park so his victims could not escape, and then brutally rape them.

Bayley's first rape was committed just months after he walked down the isle, in 1990, and a string of sexual assaults soon followed

When a judge jailed him in 2002, he said Bayley used threats and violence to satisfy his 'gross sexual appetite'.

Bayley was released on parole in 2010, and was working as a labourer in 2012 when he attacked again.

This time he killed his victim, Jill Meagher.

Bayley did appear to be sorry, Prof Ogloff said.

Though he said it was quite common for people to be very remorseful but to persist in engaging in that behaviour.

Bayley seems to agree.

'They should never have let me out,' Bayley told police after confessing to killing Ms Meagher.

'How many chances does a person need.'
