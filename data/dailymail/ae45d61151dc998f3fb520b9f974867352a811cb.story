The actor, 67, said he offered the Prince a cameo role in the classic comedy and he 'said Yes like a shot'

The Duke also made former Liberal Democrate leader 
Sir Menzies Campbell a Companion of Honour.

Buckingham Palace insisted that the Queen was not unwell but had experienced a busy weekend of engagements including the Festival of Remembrance and the service of remembrance at the Cenotaph.

A spokesman said the 87-year-old would be fulfilling a busy day of engagements tomorrow, and was looking forward to her visit to Manchester on Thursday. It is understood that the Queen has not injured her ankle.

'The Queen is experiencing some mild discomfort with her ankle, following a busy weekend,' a spokesman said.

Sir Tony revealed that nerves had got the better of him at the ceremony, admitting he found himself acting like his foolish character from the hit BBC series.

He said William had confided that he was an admirer of Blackadder, the show in which Sir Tony starred alongside Rowan Atkinson, Tim McInnerny and Hugh Laurie.

'He said that he was a big fan of Blackadder and was there going to be another series? I said we have always talked about it,' Sir Tony revealed.

The actor, who has also presented Time Team, is best known for his role as Blackadder's servant,  Baldrick

'I said to him "Would you be prepared to be in it?"  'He said "Yes" like a shot.

'I managed to do a bit of casting while he was awarding my knighthood. I think that is probably a first.'

Asked if there were plans for another Blackadder series, Sir Tony quipped: 'I don't know if we can afford Hugh Laurie.'

As for who William could play, Sir Tony said: 'I think he would have to play himself, don't you?'

The former Time Team presenter said of the ceremony: 'I messed it up completely - I forgot that you were supposed to bow at the beginning.

'I was just stood there and I was looking at HRH and he was looking at me. I stepped forward and knelt. Then I went the wrong way.

'A little bit of Baldrick crept over me when I was receiving my knighthood.'
