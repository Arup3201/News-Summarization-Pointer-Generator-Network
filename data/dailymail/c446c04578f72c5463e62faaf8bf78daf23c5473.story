The 30-year-old social network billionaire had his wealth set at $34.7billion, just over a decade after he launched thefacebook.com from his Harvard dorm room.

His huge increase in wealth in the past year - the biggest in the Forbes 400 - netting him a nine-place gain from twentieth in 2013, when his wealth stood at $19billion.

Not far behind Zuckerberg were Google founders Larry Page (#13, $31.7billion) and Sergey Brin (#14, $31.2billion), Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (#15, $29.9billion). 

A keen grasp of technology - especially social media - is the key ingredient that opened the doors to unimaginable wealth for the under-40s of the Forbes 400 list.

Top of the pile is Mark Zuckerberg, whose $34billion fortune sees him at spot 10 on the list aged just 30.

He is followed by former Harvard roommate Dustin Moskovitz, whose Facebook fortune netted him $8.2billion. While not nearly so rich, he is a few months younger than Zuckerberg,

Also just out of her twenties is Elizabeth Holmes, 30, whose $4.5billion comes from blood testing company Theranos, which she founded after dropping out of college. Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Uber and GoPro have also helped most of the other under-40s on the list into their spots.

Another long-standing giant on the Forbes list is investment guru Warren Buffett, 84, ranked second with a $68billion fortune.

The Forbes 400 list saw an influx of app founders this year, after mobile technology took another leap.

The founders of the WhatsApp messaging service, Jan Koum (#61, $7.7billion) and Brian Acton (#158, $3.4billion), joined the list after Facebook bought their company for $19billion in February.

Travis Kalanick, (#202, $3billion), who invented taxi app Uber, also found himself among the rich after his company was valued at $18.2billion this summer.

Twitter cofounder Evan Williams (#178, £3.2billion), also sailed into the list on the back of the company's IPO in November, which valued the company at $25billion.

He joins Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO, on the list. Dorsey was ranked 240th with a $2.6billion fortune.

The so-called Sage of Omaha, CEO of investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, saw his wealth rocket this year thanks to a buoyant stock market, which took shares in his company above $200,000 a piece.

He managed to keep his coveted spot near the top despite having reportedly given away some $23billion in his lifetime.

Even the lowest entrant to the Forbes 400, biotechnology magnate Alan Auerbach, has $1.4billion to his name, and the magazine reported that 113 U.S. billionaires were deemed too poor to be included.

The $2.3trillion total worth of the list is a hike of $270billion from last year, an increase of almost 12 per cent. The average fortune on the list was $5.7billion, up from $5billion last year.

More than three quarters of the list saw their values climb in the past year, with only 36 losing money.

Despite the clear influence of internet and tech phenomena such as Facebook and Amazon in the upper echelons, the top 20 was still dominated by long-standing titans of the American economy.

Joint for fourth place on the list - at $42.9billion each - were Charles and David Koch, overlords of Koch Industries, a giant company with interests in the oil industry, building and manufacturing.

The were followed by members Walton family - Christy, Jim and Alice - who derive astonishing fortunes - $38.3billion, $36.6billion and $35.2billion respectively - from the Walmart retail empire founded by Sam Walton.

The most dizzying rise on the list was from GoPro founder Nick Woodman, whose camera company has seen his wealth increase threefold since last year, giving him a total of $3.9billion thanks to huge sales of his devices, beloved of extreme sportsmen.
