Suri Cruise looked tired and strained by the emotional custody battle her parents are to embark on.

The six-year-old is currently dealing with the news that her parents are set for a high profile divorce.

Mother Katie Holmes held her daughter tenderly in her arms during a trip with friends - and of course security - to the Children's Museum of the Arts in the Soho area of New York City.

Exhausted: Suri Cruise looks tired by the news her 
parents are set for a custody battle following their divorce

Little Suri, dressed in a pink dress and holding onto a cuddly toy, clung to her actress mother.

She looked upset by the media circus as she buried her face into Katie's shoulder.

And despite a brave face, the 
Dawson's Creek beauty herself appeared to show the results of her split 
from Tom, showcasing a slender figure in fitted jeans from the 
bi-product of a break-up diet.

Taking its toll: While Katie put on a brave face, Suri showed the strain

Yesterday, Katie - who filed for divorce from the Hollywood
star last week - spent American holiday Independence Day as a single 
mother for the first time.

The 33-year-old was seen at Wholefoods supermarket near her Chelsea apartment stocking up on food supplies.

Making her way to the store, dressed 
casually in a denim shirt and a floral summery skirt, the mother-of-one 
looked feminine and pretty as she skipped along with Suri, who was in 
the same multi-coloured poppy dress she was in the night before.

Protected: Katie was flanked by a burly security guard

Inside
the market, Suri rode in the front of the shopping cart playing with a 
pale pink cowboy hat, with Katie photographing her wearing it.

The mother and daughter duo were accompanied by one of Katie's bodyguards from her top heavy security team.

During the outing Katie reassured fans that she is coping following the split from the Hollywood star.

Approached as she stocked up on food, Katie told a New York Daily News reporter: 'I'm alright. Thank you.'

Meanwhile
it emerged today that Katie has been secretly planning her divorce 
assault for several weeks with the help of her father Martin Holmes.

The super secretive plan included switching all her cell phones and email addresses.

Helping hand: Suri was guided along by her mother, who tenderly placed an arm on each of her daughter's shoulders

Tea time: Katie and Suri also had a meal at Alice's tea cup during their girly day out together

Katie was said to be contact with Tom, right up until last week, playing the role of doting wife.

'She was talking to Tom on the phone up until last week saying, "I love you,"' a source told People magazine.

But the escape plan was well underway when the actress recently visited China for work commitments.

Sweet treat: The night before Katie took Suri out for some ice-cream

'Her inner circle has been planning this and switching out cell phones since she was in China [in mid-June],' the source said.

'When
new cell phones arrived, then nobody could reach her. Her old best 
friends from last week don't have her new number, no e-mail. She's 
unreachable.'

Katie even bent the truth to Tom about her new Chelsea apartment.

Suri emerges: It was the first time that the youngster had emerged since Tom and Katie's split was announced

Hold on tight: Katie's top priority in the split is her six-year-old daughter

'[Tom] knew that she moved there, but [he thought it was] for different reasons,' the source told People.

'She
said she moved there to drive into the underground garage. There are 
fewer paparazzi and it's less intrusive for her,' the source continued.

'It was the first phase of getting 
everything out of the house, and that's why she was able to say she's 
moving without giving an indication that she was going to divorce him.'

Top heavy: Katie has enlisted burly bodyguards who are currently watching the actress 24/7

Katie's father also fired some of his daughter's assistants and hired new ones in place to help out with the grand plan.

In their new apartment building, neighbours say mother and daughter are a joy to have.

'Katie and Suri have been very 
friendly to everyone they see in the building,' a source told Radaronline. 'But they mostly keep to themselves.'

However the pair have been spotted using the communal children's playroom.

Desperate: Tom is said to be going to a court in LA in person to ensure he is legally allowed to see Suri

'Suri was there playing. Katie was with her and they were very sweet to the other people in the room.

'There were a few other kids there and
Suri quietly played with them. She seemed like a nice little girl and 
the other kids looked like they were having fun with her.'

Meanwhile, Tom, who has been kept busy shooting his latest movie Oblivion in Iceland, yesterday returned to Los Angeles where he marked his 50th birthday with a quiet lunch alongside adopted children Connor and Isabella.

The way they were: Katie announced that she was splitting with her husband of six years last Friday

He is said to have made it his 'first priority' to get temporary visitation rights to his daughter Suri.

The 50-year-old actor - who was 'blindsided' when his wife filed for divorce from him last week after five years of marriage and sought legal custody of their child - intends to go to court in Los Angeles in person to ensure he is legally allowed to see the youngster.

Hints: In next month's ELLE magazine Katie hints that she may not have been happy in the relationship for some time

Katie filed for the divorce in New York because she believes she has a better chance of winning custody, and although Tom was encouraged to file in California, the law states divorce cannot be filed in separate states at the same time.

A source said: 'Tom has told Dennis Wasser and Bert Fields, his long-time entertainment lawyer, that his first priority is getting a court order in place, obviously a temporary one, that will allow him to legally see his daughter.

'Team Cruise has extensive documentation to prove that Los Angeles is where the case should proceed, because this is where he says they have lived.

'Tom is extremely disappointed that Katie filed in New York, and he feels that she is trying to cut him out of their daughter's life.

'Tom won't tolerate it and told his lawyers that if he personally needs to go to court and make a plea in front of the judge for an order allowing him to see his daughter, he will.'

It is believed Katie wants legal custody because she is worried about Tom's devotion to sci-fi cult Scientology and the effect the quasi-religious sect may have on their six-year-old daughter.

However a source told TMZ: '[Katie] was totally committed to Scientology. She had enthusiasm for it and would voluntarily and gladly participate in it when Tom was off shooting movies.

'This is not a fight over religion. It's being used as a way to hurt Tom.'

Meanwhile, an interview with Katie from next month's ELLE magazine hints that she may not have been happy in the relationship for some time.

Discussing turning 33, she told the US publication: 'I definitely feel much more comfortable in my own skin. I feel sexier. I'm staring to come into my own. It's like a new phase.'

Asked about her marriage, she admitted she wanted to focus on herself.

She said: 'He has been Tom Cruise for 30 years. I know who I am and where I am and where I want to go, so I want to focus on that.'
