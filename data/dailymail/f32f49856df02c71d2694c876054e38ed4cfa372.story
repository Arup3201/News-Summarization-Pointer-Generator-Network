This is the incredible moment two whale sharks trapped inside a fishing net were set free.

The amazing images show divers Chris Rohner and Clare Prebble helping free the tangled pair - which then swim alongside them to say thanks.

Marine biologist Simon Pierce captured the release after approaching fisherman off Mafia Island, Tanzania, who were preparing for the rescue.

This is the incredible moment two whale sharks trapped inside a fishing net were set free by divers in Tanzania 

There were two sharks in the net - one 8m long adult and a smaller 5m fish - throughout the dive which took place in November.

Simon, from New Zealand, said: 'The main conservation challenge there is conflict between fishermen and sharks.

'The fishers use nets to catch small fish and tuna which feed on the same little shrimps the whale sharks eat.

The mammoth whale sharks, who swam into the nets,  looked like they were being chocked by the fisherman's net 

'They look for schools of fish on the surface and quickly run a net around them.

'The fish are trapped within the loop and the net is pulled in by hand. It's hard, labour-intensive work with 30-50 fishers on each boat.

'If whale sharks are amongst the fish then they often get enclosed in the net themselves.

'The fishers use nets to catch small fish and tuna which feed on the same little shrimps the whale sharks eat,' Simon said

'A lot of the sharks have entanglement scars so it's obvious this can be a problem.

'Once the net had been pulled together the whale sharks approached the surface and Chris swam in to check they were okay.

'The larger shark eventually swam right up to the net so the fishers lowered the floats so he could swim across without tangling.

The divers came to the aid of the terrified whale sharks who had become tangled in the gigantic fishing nets

'The shark gave a couple of big kicks and swam away fine before the second, smaller shark followed.'

He added: 'Our project team has started to work with the fishermen and they're great.

'They help us to find the sharks and even report in their sighting information when we're not there.

'The fishers aren't interested in catching the sharks - they want to let them escape with no fuss so they can keep the fish in the net.

Eventually, the whale sharks were set free and followed the divers to thank them. The whole thing was caught on camera by Simon Pierce

The gigantic whale shark was captured in the nets in Tanzania. The whale shark is a vulnerable species. According to Pierce, there are only 30 pups in the world 

'During the day it all worked like the well-practiced operation it is. No damage to the net and the sharks escaped without any injury.

'Mafia is one of the best places in the world to see whale sharks as individual sharks spend a long time in the area.

'It allows us to find them consistently.'
