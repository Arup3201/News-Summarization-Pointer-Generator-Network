The first Briton known to have caught the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa was discharged from hospital today and joked he won't be going back because his passport has been incinerated.

William Pooley, 29, a  volunteer nurse, was flown back to the UK for treatment on August 24 after contracting the virus in Sierra Leone.

He was then rushed across London to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead Heath where he was put in an isolation ward and treated with the experimental drug ZMapp. 

Asked whether he would be returning to Africa, he said he currently had no plans to do so, adding: 'They incinerated my passport so my mum will be pleased to know I cannot go anywhere at the moment.' 

Despite the grave dangers, Mr Pooley had selflessly volunteered to serve in a makeshift clinic where other nurses had died from ebola or were too scared to come into work.

Speaking today he described being in the isolation unit as 'like being in a fishtank' and said it was so busy in hospital he 'didn't have much time to ponder the full potential of the illness'. 

Mr Pooley also praised the 'world-class care' he had received at the hospital and thanked the Government and RAF for getting him home so quickly.

He said he had feared for his life after being diagnosed with the virus and woken by doctors in protective clothing.

'I was worried I was going to die,' Mr Pooley said.

He said: 'I was very lucky in several ways, firstly in the standard of care that I received, which is a world apart from what people are receiving in west Africa, despite various organisations' best efforts.

'I had amazing care, which was one difference. The other difference is that my symptoms never progressed to the worst stage of the disease - people I have seen dying horrible deaths.

Africa is facing the worst epidemic since the disease was first identified 38 years ago 

'I had some unpleasant symptoms but nothing compared to some of the worst of the disease, especially when people are dying.'

He did not even vomit, he said, but had suffered high temperatures and some stomach problems.

Mr Pooley said he had no regrets about his decision to go to help people stricken with the deadly virus in west Africa, which is in the middle of a horrific epidemic that has killed more than 2,000 people.

He said: 'I have mixed memories, some great memories and some horrible memories - lots of people dying.

ZMapp is a blend of three laboratory-made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus.

Two US doctors given the drug after they were infected with Ebola while working in Liberia subsequently recovered.

But it is not known whether they were saved by the drug or just lucky. About 45% of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment.

At least two other patients treated with ZMapp have died, possibly because help got to them too late. 

However, it remains to be seen how quickly production of the drug can be geared up to meet future demand.

ZMapp, developed by US biotech company Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, is manufactured in the leaves of genetically modified tobacco plants.

Potentially the process could yield 20 to 40 doses per month, said Dr Kobinger.

Evidence suggests that effective treatment with ZMapp requires three doses of 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.

'But also some wonderful memories of people going home, people showing massive spirit and cheer, despite the horrible conditions, the truly heroic people that I worked with, people that went on to get sick, so it is a massive mix of memories.'

Mr Pooley said he had undergone blood tests after feeling ill in Sierra Leone.

He told how he went to bed feeling sick and was woken by a World Health Organisation doctor in personal protective equipment (PPE) - a protective suit - after the tests came back positive.

'He was in PPE so I knew it was bad news,' Mr Pooley said.

'It was a bit disturbing to get that diagnosis but I had been half expecting it because I had been feeling sick.'

He added: 'I was worried about my family, I was scared.'

Mr Pooley said coming out of the isolation tent at the hospital had been a 'special moment'.

He said he would be heading home to East Anglia to recuperate with friends and family after being discharged. 

Infectious diseases consultant Dr Michael Jacobs, who treated Mr Pooley, said he posed no contagion risk to members of the public.

He was being cared for at a special unit at the Royal Free but today the hospital announced he was discharged.

The drug he was given, ZMapp, was first given last month to two US aid workers, who were flown home for treatment from Liberia.

Mr Pooley, who comes from the small village of Eyke in Suffolk, was airlifted back to Britain in a specially equipped C17 RAF aircraft.

The hospital said in a statement: 'Following 10 days of successful treatment in the high level isolation unit - the only one in the UK - Mr Pooley is being discharged from the Royal Free Hospital today.'  

Close to 1,500 people have so far died across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the worst epidemic since the disease was first identified 38 years ago. 

Mr Pooley had been volunteering at the ebola centre in Kenema, one of the worst affected areas, for just five weeks when he fell ill.

Previously he had been providing palliative care to patients at the Shepherd's Hospice in Sierra Leone's capital city, Freetown, and had been there since March. 

But as the ebola epidemic began and he heard that healthcare professionals were fleeing for fear of catching the disease, he decided to go to Kenema.

Mr Pooley is the only Briton to be have ever been infected by ebola outside the laboratory. The only other British case was in 1976, when scientist Geoffrey Platt pricked himself with a needle contaminated with the virus.
