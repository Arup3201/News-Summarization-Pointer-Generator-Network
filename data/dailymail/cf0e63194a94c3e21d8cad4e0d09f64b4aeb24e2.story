A BBC journalist last night made an unfortunate hand gesture while talking about beheading videos.

Clive Myrie was presenting a segment for the BBC News Channel about the clips on Facebook when he misread the word ‘parents’ as ‘patients’ and made a cutting movement.

The 49-year-old from Bolton, Lancashire - who has worked for the corporation since 1987 - was talking about Prime Minister David Cameron’s comments about the website hosting graphic videos.

A graphic was displayed on the screen with Mr Cameron’s comments, and Mr Myrie appeared to stumble over his words before performing the hand gesture when the programme cut back to him.

The gaffe - which happened at 9.45pm - was picked up on by viewers on Twitter, with Joshua Goucher saying: 'Clive Myrie taking the beheading news story very seriously. #CaughtYaClive.’

The University of Sussex law graduate has previously worked for the BBC in Paris, Washington, Tokyo and Los Angeles, but his first job for the corporation was as a reporter for BBC Radio Bristol.

He has worked on various major stories during his career, including the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, the Mozambique floods, the war in Kosovo and the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Error: Mr Myrie misread the word 'parents' as 'patients' in the quote from Prime Minister David Cameron

Alert: Facebook has begun adding warning messages to videos on its website showing decapitations

Nobody was available for comment last night when MailOnline contacted the BBC’s press office.

Mr Myrie was referring to Mr Cameron’s comments after the Prime Minister accused Facebook of irresponsibility yesterday for lifting a ban on users posting horrific videos of beheadings.

Mr Cameron demanded the social networking site explain its decision to parents, and child internet protection campaigners accused the US firm of ‘taking leave of its senses’.

Facebook said that while the shocking images must not be posted for ‘sadistic pleasure’ they should be available for those who wish to condemn them.

However, last night it was revealed Facebook had removed a video of a woman being beheaded and said it would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are permitted on the site.
