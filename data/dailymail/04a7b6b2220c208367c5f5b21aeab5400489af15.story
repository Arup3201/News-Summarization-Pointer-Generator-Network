Italian mobsters shot dead a rival gangster in the courtyard of an Italian nursery as dozens of children rehearsed their Christmas carol service nearby.

Victim Luigi Lucenti, 50, had been fleeing the attackers when he was chased into the nursery by masked gunmen and shot several times at point-blank range.

The murderers eventually escaped on a powerful motorbike and police said it was a miracle that nobody was injured.

Coldblooded: Luigi Lucenti, 50, had been fleeing masked gunmen when they chased him into a nursery in Naples' Scampia district and killed him

Terrified pupils and teachers dived for cover as the hitmen struck and TV footage showed a huge pool of blood on the floor where Lucenti had been shot.

The killing happened at a nursery in the Scampia district of Naples - home to the notorious local mafia known as the Camorra.

The area is at the centre of a bloody turf war between mobsters over the control of lucrative drug markets.

Lucenti, is the latest victim in a feud which has seen dozens killed as the Scissionisti gang, who Lucenti was linked to, fought it out with rivals the Girati.

Only last week an innocent man was shot dead after being mistaken by hitmen as an opposing gang member.

A Naples police spokesman said: 'It appears that Lucenti ran into the nursery thinking that his killers would not follow him inside but they did and they shot him several times at point blank range in the courtyard.'

'The children and teachers were inside at the time and it is a miracle that no-one else was hurt. The children were inside singing carols for the Christmas performance.

Aftermath: Police outside the nursery school afte the ambush by members of the Camorra, a mafia-style organisation operating in Naples, Italy.

'It looks like he was hit once in the street outside and then he ran into the nursery and was deliberately followed inside.'

The school's headteacher Vincenzo Montesano said: 'The children were all led out through a secondary exit. They didn't see the shooting so we hope they will all be ok. We will just have to wait and see. It's lucky they were inside singing and not on a break otherwise things could have been very different.'

Italy's Interior Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri said: 'Sadly Scampia is like an open wound. We are dealing with a battle that has gone on for a long time and will take time. The level of police officers will continue to remain high in the area and we will not weaken our stance.'

Local councillor Angelo Pisani said: 'We strongly condemn this action but that's not enough. These beasts acted without any thought of the children who were in the nursery and who risked being caught up in what happened. What if the children had been outside? What if they had seen the body?'
