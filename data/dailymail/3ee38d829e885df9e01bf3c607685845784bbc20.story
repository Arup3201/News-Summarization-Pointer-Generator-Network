A tipster in California has led police to the man accused of murdering the aunt of a Los Angeles Clippers star, who last week begged his followers on social media for help finding the man.

The Sacramento Police Department on Tuesday said the suspect, Michael Williams, had been found in the city 'thanks to a citizen tip.' He is in police custody.

Williams is accused in the July 8 stabbing of his estranged wife, Tanganyika Williams, who is the aunt of LA Clippers small forward Matt Barnes.

A furious Barnes last week begged his 262,000 social media followers for help tracking Williams down.

Star power: NBA star Matt Barnes posted this message last week to his 260,000 Instagram and Twitter followers and asked for people to come forward and turn Michael Williams over to cops

Barnes grew up outside Sacramento, the city where his aunt was murdered earlier this month. He currently plays for the Los Angeles Clippers

The player,
 34, told his fans: 'This dude stabbed my auntie in the neck last week 
& left her for dead on the sidewalk, she ended up dying on the way 
to the hospital in the ambulance.'

Meanwhile, the family of his aunt created a GoFundMe page to raise $5,000 to pay for her funeral.

Before the start of last season, Barnes signed a three-year, $10.2million contract with the Clippers.

Police identified Michael Williams as the suspect in the murder, but he fled the scene and police have not been able to find him, the Sacramento Bee reports.

He was believed to have been hiding out on the streets of Sacramento. 

It's not clear whether Michael Williams is also related to Barnes.

Barnes grew up in a suburb of Sacramento before finding basketball stardom.

He is married to Gloria Govan, who appeared in VH1 reality shows Basketball Wives and Basketball Wives: LA. They have twin sons.
