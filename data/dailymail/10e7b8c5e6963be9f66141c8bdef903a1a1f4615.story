Rebel forces have routed most of Muammar Gaddafi's troops in the Libyan oil town of Brega in the biggest boost for the insurgents' military campaign in eastern Libya in weeks.

The rebel fighters have encircled Brega, an oil export terminal with a refinery and chemical plant which for months marked the eastern limit of Gaddafi's control, rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said.

But its streets are littered with landmines, making it hard to secure full control of the area.

'The main body (of Gaddafi's forces) retreated to Ras Lanuf' to the west, Abdulmolah said by telephone.

'I am told they have some four-wheel-drive trucks with machine guns spread out between Ras Lanuf and Bishr.'

David Cameron and South African President Jacob Zuma today disagreed over an exit strategy for Libya.

President Zuma says he wanted to
see negotiations aimed at ending the five-month-old rebellion there and has pushed for NATO to give an African
Union (AU) 'roadmap' involving talks between Libyan rebels and leader 
Muammar Gaddafi the chance to succeed.   

'Once there was a fight, 
the AU took a very clear position -- that military intervention would 
not solve the problem. You needed political intervention,' Zuma said.   

'How must Gaddafi go? Where must he go? Why must he go? These 
issues must be put on the table, and the Libyan people must decide,' 
said Zuma, whose government has accused the West of trying to 
assassinate Gaddafi.   

NATO has been bombing Libya for nearly five 
months under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians from 
bombardment by forces loyal to Gaddafi, who has shown no sign of being 
prepared to end his 42-year rule in the face of the rebellion.   

Cameron,
whose Africa trip has been reduced to two days by an escalating phone 
hacking scandal at home, said he and Zuma both wanted the same result --
a peaceful and democratic Libya.   

'We both want to see a future for Libya that doesn't include Colonel Gaddafi,' Cameron said.   

'The
difference is that the president sees that as the outcome of a 
political process, whereas I believe for a political process to work it 
has to be the starting point. That is the difference between us. That's 
the gap.'   

Rebel forces based in Benghazi control a swathe of 
eastern Libya, the western city of Misrata, and parts of the Western 
Mountains southwest of the capital Tripoli, which is Gaddafi's 
stronghold.   

While rebel fighters have been making 
gains in eastern and western Libya in recent days, Russia criticised the
United States and other countries for recognising the rebel leadership 
as the legitimate government of Libya, saying they were taking sides in 
the insurgents' five-month-old war to oust Gaddafi.

'Those who declare recognition stand fully on the side of one political force in a civil war,' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow on Monday.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced U.S. recognition of the rebels on Friday, while in Turkey for a meeting of an international contact group on Libya - a major diplomatic step that could unblock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds.

Russia and China have taken a softer line towards Gaddafi, and neither attended the contact group meeting.

Brega, about 750 km (465 miles) east of Tripoli, is the site of a strategic oil terminal.

The attack could signal a new rebel push westwards from their main stronghold in the east of the country after weeks of stalemate.

Gaddafi is refusing to step down despite the five-month-old rebellion against his rule, a campaign of NATO air strikes, and the defections of members of his inner circle.

The slow progress of the rebel military campaign has caused strains within NATO, some member states pressing for a negotiated solution to hasten the end of a conflict many thought would last only a few weeks.

Reports have circulated that Gaddafi is seeking a negotiated way out of the crisis, but in a speech on Saturday he described the rebels as worthless traitors and rejected suggestions that he was about to leave the country.

Brega has changed hands several times in the back-and-forth fighting along Libya's Mediterranean coast since the rebellion began in February.

Rebels say taking it back will be a tipping point in the conflict on the eastern front.

NATO warplanes have been attacking pro-Gaddafi forces near Brega.

The alliance said targets hit on Friday included one tank, five armoured fighting vehicles and two rocket launchers.

Libyan officials in Tripoli have made no comment on any fighting in Brega, and it was not immediately possible to verify rebel accounts of what was happening there.

On another front, in the Western Mountains region southwest of Tripoli, pro-Gaddafi forces exchanged artillery fire on Sunday with rebels in the village of Al-Qawalish, a rebel fighter manning a checkpoint there told Reuters.

Despite resistance from Gaddafi troops, the rebels have made advances in the area.
