Bill Cosby has staunchly refused to say a word about the dozens of rape accusations leveled against him over the past few months but on Thursday he finally broke his silence...with a joke.

At a comedy show in London, Ontario, the actor alluded to the serious allegations as he saw a woman getting up from the front row and asked her where she was going.

She said she was getting a drink and politely asked if he wanted her to bring anything back for him,  according to National Post reporter Richard Warnica who attended the event.

He said no, that he had his own bottle of water and then said 'You have to be careful drinking around me.'

Breaking his silence: Bill Cosby made a joke about the dozens of rape accusations leveled against him, during a comedy show Thursday night in London, Ontario. Pictured above at Wednesday night's comedy show in Kitchener, Ontario

The statement refers to a theme in several of his accusers' stories - that he drugged their drinks before raping them. 

Warnica says the crowd erupted in loud gasps, but that their shock soon turned to support as they laughed and gave a round of applause for the comment. 

Thursday night's show was the second in a three-stop comedy tour of Canada. Both nights have been the subject of protests outside the venues, as ticket-holders were heckled by demonstrators holding signs like 'rape is not joke'.

Before the show started, Warnica tweeted a photo of a piece of paper handed out to those walking into venue Budweiser Gardens. 

The slip of paper warns 'disruptive behavior will not be tolerated and will result in removal, possible legal action and banning from the venue'. 

One man was kicked out of Thursday night's event for yelling 'you are a rapist'. 

Dale Carruthers, a journalist who tried to film the man being escorted out by security, was also kicked out. 

Cosby's publicist later confirmed the heckler in a statement, describing the situation as 'one outburst' in a crowd of 'loyal, patient and courageous' fans. The statement ends with Cosby saying 'I'm far from finished'. 

Warnica says that while the venue was not full, it was far from empty and the crowd seemed to enjoy Cosby's performance. 

He received a standing ovation for a second night in a row.
