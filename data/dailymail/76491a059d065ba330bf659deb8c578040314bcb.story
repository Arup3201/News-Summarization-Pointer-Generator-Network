French film star Gerard Depardieu has sparked fresh outrage in France by defending Vladimir Putin's clampdown on his opponents and declaring: 'The masses are stupid.'

The actor - who recently became a French tax exile and was given a Russian passport - also defended sending the three members of Pussy Riot to a Russian labour camp.

And in an extraordinary comparison, he said the trio - who staged an anti-Putin protest in a Moscow church - would have been 'executed' if they had done the same thing in a mosque.

Controversial: Gerard Depardieu has spoken out to defend Vladimir Putin's Russian regime

France's Metro newspaper today branded the Gallic screen legend 'a spokesman for the Kremlin'.

The 64-year-old actor spoke out on state-run TV Channel Russia 24 at the weekend, when he attacked the millions who accused the Russian president of rigging last year's parliamentary election.

Depardieu - who has been offered the post of culture minister of the Russian republic of Mordovia - told viewers: 'The Russian opposition has no programme. It has nothing.

'Unfortunately, the masses are stupid. Only the individual is beautiful.'

Depardieu said the opposition had some 'very smart people' such as former chess champion Garry Kasparov in its ranks.

But he added: 'That is good for chess, and not much else.'

And he said of Pussy Riot, the all-female punk band who performed in Moscow's main cathedral last year: 'Imagine if these ladies walked into a mosque - they would not have come out alive.

'But when I say such things in France, I am considered an idiot. I know lots of Russians who lived in France, but have now returned to their homeland because they missed the human warmth they find there.'

Former French minister and now MEP Corinne Lepage said of the actor: 'If Gerald Depardieu wants to be culture minister in a republic that still has prison labour camps and make a "man-sandwich" with Vladimir Putin, that's his business.'

The Cyrano de Bergerac star is among flood of wealthy French people to have come under attack for quitting the country over plans for a new top tax rate of 75 per cent on earnings over â‚¬1million.

Electronic music icon Jean-Michel Jarre and tycoon optician Alain Afflelou are both moving to Britain, while France's richest man Bernard Arnault has tried and failed to get Belgian nationality.

Depardieu was branded 'shabby and unpatriotic' by French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault after announcing last month that he was moving abroad.

But the furious star hit back with an open letter to Mr Ayrault in Le Journal du Dimanche, storming: 'I don't ask to be approved of, but I could at least be respected!

'All those who have left France have not been insulted as I have been.'

Depardieu said he had always paid his taxes and asked the prime minister: 'Who are you to judge me in this way?

'I also give you back my passport and my social security that I have never used.'

Paris estate agents have also said France's luxury property market has hit a 'selling panic' as the super-rich flee to 'wealth-friendly' countries like Britain and Switzerland.

Daniel Feau said: 'Some 400 to 500 residences worth more than â‚¬1million have come onto the Paris market since May. It's nearly a general panic.'

And British estate agent Knight Frank said the socialist's tax plans had sent French interest in luxury London homes rocketing.

David Cameron angered the French in June when he said Britain would 'roll out the red carpet' to wealthy French wanted to relocate to the UK.

He added: 'And they can pay tax in Britain and pay for our health service and schools and everything else.'

The comments left French MP Claude Bartolone so offended he suggested Mr Cameron must have been 'drunk' when he made them.
