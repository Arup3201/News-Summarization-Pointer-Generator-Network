An art director's obsessive desire to photograph as many burglar alarms as she can has proven to be a surprisingly popular internet hit.

Victoria MacDonald has picked up thousands of followers to her blog, Burglar Alarm Britain, since she first hit upon the idea of capturing them for the sake of posterity while photographing shop fronts.

The 40-year-old said she became 'fascinated' with the 'naive' designs and how they can often vary wildly from area to area.

Dated: It is ironic that this alarm above the Ancient Hall street sign in York would be called 'Modern'

Social diversity: Alarms in inner cities tend to have more foreboding names. Cromwell burglar (left) sits over Millman street in Camden, while a CIA alarm on deters burglars in Berwick Street, Soho

Arguing
the objects are pieces of local art, she states on her blog: 
'Amateurish logos predominate, seemingly designed by a jobbing printer 
or
the proprietor’s child, possibly under the influence of drink.

'Rural 
liveries tend towards the whimsical, with jaunty creatures and 
decorative fonts.

'Well-heeled towns offer pompous serif concepts such as
Decorum and Quality, while inner-city walls blare bold tabloid 
exhortations to STAND FAST and AMBUSH!'

Every day a snap of the latest weird and wacky design to have caught her attention is added to her site.

Some of the alarms are designed to look like flowers or animals whereas others look more intimidating and obvious.

Deterrent: It is unlikely this Minder alarm in Newport Street, Lambeth would keep the burglars away

Dogged: This Shorrock alarm in the wealthy Clifton area of Bristol appears almost welcoming

Once she has uploaded her pictures she categorises them into 
sections including technology, science, houses, union Jacks, heraldic, 
royalty and crazy creatures.

Followers to her blog even upload their own photos to Ms MacDonald's website.

Obsessed: Victoria MacDonald has taken photos of hundreds of burglar alarms

The art director and editor from central London said: 'It all 
began when I was doing a project photographing shop fronts.

'After looking at one of the pictures I realised there was a burglar alarm.

'It was called a Blitz and then I saw two more called Spitfire and 
Churchill, and I wondered why they had Second World War names.

'I was interested so I started looking at alarms more and more and began
photographing them and eventually launched a blog and began posting my 
pictures online.

'After a recent trip to Wiltshire I returned with 76 photos of burglar alarms. It’s a local art, and it’s fun noting how styles vary by area.

She added: 'Wessex Fire and Security’s old design was one of my favourites and 
although they’ve recently updated their identity I’m delighted they’ve 
kept the wise old owl.

'I used to take all the pictures of the burglar alarm boxes myself, but 
the blog has got so popular that people have started submitting them.

'It really has developed into something that I never could have imagined.'

Out of place: This MAS alarm adorns the exterior of Liverpool Anglican Cathedral

Complimentary: This alarm at It's All Greek Camden resembles the Acropolis in Athens

Big beast: The Ivory burglar alarm in Maple Street, Camden does look like it means business
