Lance Franklin was racially slurred during a match against the Western Bulldogs on Sunday

Footy star Lance 'Buddy' Franklin was allegedly called an 'ape' by a rival support during a game on Sunday.

A 70-year-old supporter was evicted by police from Melbourne's Etihad Stadium on Sunday after fans allegedly heard him abuse the Sydney Swans forward during a match against the Western Bulldogs.

The fan also allegedly abused another player during the game.

The abuse is almost identical to the racial slur against fellow Swans forward Adam Goodes, who was called an 'ape' by a 13-year-old Collingwood fan during a match last season

Supporters in the ground complained about the man's 'offensive behaviour' to police, and he was escorted and given a penalty notice in relation to the incident.

Witnesses say they heard the word 'ape' directed at the Franklin. However the Sydney Swans club confirmed that none of its players heard the slur.

Franklin was one of the game's best, kicking six goals in the 63-point thumping of the Western Bulldogs in front of a crowd of 22,000.

The 70-year-old man, from Newport in Melbourne's southwest, was evicted from the ground about 4.35pm, about halfway through he match when Sydney were already well in front.

The Sydney Swans said that none of its players hear the allegations of racial abuse

Adam Goodes was also the subject of racial abuse during a match with Collingwood last year

An AFL Australia spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia the man 'was not a club member' of the Western Bulldogs and that the incident was a matter for the police.

It is the second time in a year that a Sydney Swans player has been racially abused, after legendary AFL footballer Adam Goodes was also called an Ape by a 13-year-old fan.

The incident was further inflamed when Collingwood president Eddie McGuire said that Goodes should be used to promote the musical King King in Melbourne.

Goodes,  the 2013 Australian Of The Year, went public over both incidents and earlier this year said McGuire's comments had ended their friendship.

Two incidents of racial abuse were also reported at AFL matches last year, including one involving North Melbourne's Sudanese-born Majak Daw.

Television reports said Daw, who escaped to Australia with his family from civil wars in Sudan, was racially abused by a Hawthorn supporter during a match at the MCG.
