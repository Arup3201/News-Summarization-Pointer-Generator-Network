An American man jailed in the United Arab Emirates for posting a video parody on Youtube was sentenced today to one year in prison and fined $2,700  or 10,00 dirham for 'endangering national security.'

Shezanne 'Shez' Cassim, 29, was arrested in April and charged with violating a 2012 cyber crime law after posting a 19 minute video that mocks Dubai teenagers who are influenced by hip hop culture. The video is set at a 'combat school' where gangsters from the suburb of Satwa learn to use their clothing accessories as whips and are advised to throw sandals at their targets. After Cassim's arrest, he was moved to a maximum security prison in Ahu Dhabi in June and since then, comedians like Will Ferrell, Adam Mckay, and the rest of the team behind the website Funny or Die have been rallying for Cassim's release. Despite their video urging the United Aram Emirites to Free Shez, the man will spend time behind bars.

'We believe in freedom of speech and we’re trying to galvanize the 
comedy world in support of Shez,” said Patrick Starzan, Funny or Die’s 
vice president of marketing told the Star Tribune.

'Comedy resonates to get messages across.'

Funny or Die's video has messages recorded by Will Ferrell, Chris Mintz-Plasse, Patton Oswalt and other celebrities who are defending the American's right to free speech.

'It was just for fun. It was -- he's a big fan of sketch comedies. He's a big fan of 'SNL,' 'Funny or Die,' all those shows, and he and his friends just wanted to make a funny sketch comedy in their spare time,' Shez's brother Shervon Cassim said.

Cassim is the first foreigner arrested under tougher measures governing internet use in the United Arab Emirates, according to the Emirates Center for Human Rights.

Several other people who featured in 
the parody video have also been held in jail, alongside Mr Cassim, who 
was born in Sri Lanka before becoming an American citizen.

The Huffington Post reports that two 
Indian defendants received similar sentences and that two Emirati brothers
 were sentenced to eight months behind bars and received 5,000 dirham 
fines, reported a state-owned newspaper The National. A third brother 
was pardoned.

CNN reported that Cassim's charges were not read in court. All that UEA officials have said is, 'Mr. Cassim was charged under the UAE's penal code. Anyone charged with a crime under the laws of the UAE is entitled to the fair trial protections contained in the UAE's constitution.'

'There was no indication in local law that making a comedy video, making fun of teenagers in the suburbs, was a threat to the UAE's national security,' said Shez's brother Chevron cassim.

The 29-year-old, who has a degree in political science, moved from Minnesota to Dubai after graduating in 2006 and worked at

Emirates Airline before taking a job earlier this year as a business consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Funny or Die did their best to show the Shez was merely trying to exercise his free speech

The U.S. government cannot force a foreign leadership to release American inmates but it can demand immediate access to them.

Members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation, including Senators Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, have tried to intervene, pressing the United Arab Emirates’ U.S. ambassador for answers, according to the Star Tribune. Cassim's sentence is beyond American control.

The case reflects a wider crackdown by Gulf Arab authorities on social media use. In the past two years, dozens of people have been arrested for Twitter posts deemed offensive to leaders or for social media campaigns urging more political openness.

Hardly threatening: The video shows 'gangstas' teaching people to hit people with fashionable shoes and belts

The video, called Satwa Combat School, is set in the Satwa district of Dubai. The family said in a statement that the parody pokes fun at Dubai teenagers who called themselves 'gangstas', but were known for mild behavior. The video is fictional and not meant to offend.

'It’s tragic. It’s something that can happen to anybody, especially young people who post all the time on YouTube,'said Cassim's attorney Susan Burns.

'To be incarcerated over something that’s clearly a joke, clearly meant in jest, clearly meant in good humor - and held for seven months - is a violation of human rights.'

Shez's brother Shevron Cassim also spent two months in Dubai trying to convince authorities to release him.

'At a time when the United Arab Emirates is holding itself out as a modern country, it is sadly ironic and a poor image to present to the world that it continues to imprison my brother for uploading a silly video,' he said.

Family members were able to speak with Cassim who was granted a phone call.

'He tries to put on a brave face,' Shervon Cassim said. 'He said that he was doing fine, not to worry about him, but I could just sense that he's a little depressed -- my impression is that he's going just a little bit crazy in his cell.'

Not even a celebrity-run website dedicated to freeing the young comedian was enough to keep him from jail
