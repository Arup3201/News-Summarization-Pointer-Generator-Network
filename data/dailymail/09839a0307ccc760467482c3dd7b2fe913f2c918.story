The potentially massive impact of fracking on house prices was revealed yesterday – with one woman saying the value of her home has been cut by £535,000.

Dianne Westgarth told how the price of her five-bedroom house had plummeted by over 70 per cent as a result of a proposed fracking site nearby.

In 2012, the property – which comes with two-and-a-half acres of land – was valued at £725,000.

Dianne Westgarth said the price of her five-bedroom house on the Fylde peninsula in Lancashire - just 300 yards from a site where a drilling firm wants to start fracking - had dropped by 70 per cent

‘The new valuation came in at £190,000,’ she said. ‘Two other estate agents said they would rather not even comment, because the possibility of fracking meant they couldn’t actually say if it was worth anything at all.’

The divorced 53-year-old wants to downsize in preparation for her sons, aged 17 and 21, finishing their education. Her house is on the Fylde peninsula in Lancashire – just 300 yards from a site where drilling firm Cuadrilla wants to start fracking.

‘I’m directing all my efforts at ensuring the site near my home doesn’t get permission,’ she added. ‘Currently, my house is worth next to nothing.’

She spoke out as it emerged that the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) – which values properties for council tax – had admitted that commercial activities such as fracking could cause their estimates to be downgraded.

‘If you have a wind farm or other development built near your house it can have a significant impact on the value of your property,’ a spokesman told The Sunday Times.

‘Fracking is not widespread yet but if a new site had a knock-on effect on the value of the house then it could also affect the council tax banding.’

Supporters of shale drilling claim it could revolutionise Britain’s energy supply, with trillions of cubic feet of gas said to lie beneath Lancashire.

But the detrimental effect experienced by Mrs Westgarth has been echoed elsewhere. James Nisbet, who lives near another potential drilling site near Blackpool, said a would-be purchaser pulled out of buying his £375,000 house after hearing about the plan.

Cuadrilla wants to start fracking on the nearby site. Supports claim it could revolutionise Britain's energy supply, but several homeowners are feeling the detrimental effects of the proposals 

‘I’ve been a Conservative voter since I was 18,’ he said. ‘I’m now 60 but it’s the last time I will vote Conservative because they have sold Lancashire down the swanny with no regard for people’s health and well-being.’

Similar fears have been expressed further south at Fernhurst in West Sussex, where another fracking proposal has been lodged.

Chris Hebert, of Hamptons estate agency in nearby Haslemere, said: ‘If someone’s got something going on 24/7, people will not buy their house.’

The revelations come just weeks after the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was accused of a fracking ‘cover-up’ after it censored a key report on the topic no less than 63 times in 13 pages.

The chapter examining the effect of drilling on house prices had three sections redacted – although it did acknowledge a study which found the value of properties near a well in Texas had fallen by up to 14 per cent.

However both the VOA and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) yesterday insisted there was no evidence to link fracking with falling house prices.

‘There is no evidence that house prices have been affected in over half a century of oil and gas exploration in the UK or evidence that this would be the case with shale,’ a spokesman for the DECC said.

‘This Government believes that shale has a positive part to play in our future energy mix, providing energy security, driving growth and creating jobs.’

A spokesman for VOA said: ‘Every case is different and each... value change is assessed on its own merits.'
