Official report: Lord Myners' review has flattened claims that taxpayers may have lost £1billion as the Government privatisation undervalued Royal Mail

Taxpayers were short-changed by £180million after the sale of Royal Mail - but not the £1billion predicted at the time, an official report said today.

There was fury during the sale last October when shares were sold for 330p, raising almost £2billion, but within a week they were worth 550p. 

Opponents said the Government had mishandled the deal and could have received millions more for the public purse when the privatisation went ahead.

Former city minister Lord Myners said today the sell-off was executed with 'considerable professionalism' and the Government and taxpayer achieved 'significant value'.

He said that raising the share price sale level by more than 30p to 350p could have put the whole deal at risk. This would have raised the extra £180million. 

The Government sold 60 per cent of Royal Mail. 

Lord Myners said: 'This is a seminal piece of work which has the potential to fundamentally alter the way companies are floated on the UK stock market and I look forward to seeing how this develops.

'I regard the Royal Mail privatisation to have been a complex exercise executed with considerable professionalism. Many previous governments attempted to sell but failed. The sale was done against a backdrop of global economic uncertainty and a threat of industrial action, which go a long way towards explaining the cautious approach taken throughout the process.

'There were also some inherent complexities built into the transaction, such as a generous retail offer, which added to this caution. The Government adopted conventional standard market practices built up over time.

'We found no evidence to challenge the general assertion that an IPO price greater than 350-360p could have been achieved and we accept that a decision to revise the range would have come with added uncertainty and risk. The right decisions were made.

'We do not believe that a price anywhere near the levels seen in the aftermarket could have been achieved at listing. The aftermarket conditions were extraordinary, unpredictable and did not reflect significant value 'left on the table' as some concluded at the time. The Government and taxpayer achieved significant value.'

Shares shortfall: There was fury when the sale went through because shares went for 330p - only to reach 550p within a week

The National Audit Office criticised the flotation earlier this year and an influential committee of MPs made the claim in July that taxpayers may have lost £1billion as the Government privatisation undervalued Royal Mail.

The Business Select Committee said taxpayers missed out on ‘significant value’ when the Government pushed through flotation of part of its stake in the mail delivery firm but did not focus on getting the best price for taxpayers.

The MPs claimed the Government feared ‘failing’ over the controversial sell-off and received poor advice.

The Business Select Committee recommended changes for future sell-offs suggesting that companies that advise the Government on share issues should be excluded from becoming a preferred investor.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'I am very grateful to Lord Myners and his expert panel for this important and insightful report. It contains a number of significant proposals which could make the general process of future sales more transparent.

'I would encourage financial regulators and those bringing companies to market to engage in this debate. In particular they should explore how digital auctions could, in certain circumstances, make the sale process much more flexible.

'I also welcome his comment that the sale was executed with considerable professionalism and that any decision to try to have priced the shares higher would have been risky. We were right not to take that risk.'
