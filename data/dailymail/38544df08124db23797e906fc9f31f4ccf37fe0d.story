Garry Monk escaped FA punishment after comments made about referee Michael Oliver in the wake of penalty controversy at Stoke.

The official handed the Potters a penalty after Victor Moses appeared to dive, with the Swansea manager scathing in his assessment after the 2-1 defeat last Sunday.

Monk - who called for the introduction of retrospective action to stop simulation - had been ordered to explain his comments to the FA but will now face no action.

'The penalty against is a disgrace. It's a disgraceful decision. 

'Not in a million years is it a penalty and the problem we'll have with it now is a lot of games we're having this season a match-changing decision is going against us constantly and I don't see anything being done about it.'

He insisted that he stood by his remarks, which included telling Moses he should be ‘ashamed’ of the manner in which he won a soft penalty – a decision by Oliver that Monk branded ‘disgraceful’.

A Swansea statement read: 'Swansea City can confirm that the Football Association will not be taking any further action regarding media comments made by manager Garry Monk following the recent Barclay Premier League fixture at Stoke City.

'The FA, who asked Monk for his observations following the fixture, has reminded the Swansea manager about his responsibilities regarding media comments.'

Monk, who says he would fine any member of the Swansea team who dives in a match or training, had gone on to claim that retrospective bans and financial penalties would be the only way to deal with simulation.

He added: ‘I've spoken to all our players. I'm not saying a Swansea player will never do it but the rules are there, the players know about it and they know how I feel.

‘I'd like to see retrospective punishment in these situations - a fine and a ban. It's something we need to consider.

‘I don't think the majority of football likes to see it. That's the only way I can see it would make players think twice about doing it.’

Referring to the FA’s call for his ‘observations in relation to post-match media comments’, Monk added: ‘I stand by comments. I spoke about how I felt at the time about Victor Moses and the situation. It was clear for me and I stand by my comments.’
