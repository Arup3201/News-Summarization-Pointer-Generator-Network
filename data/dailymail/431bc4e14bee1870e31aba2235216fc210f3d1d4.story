Brave: Jon Leyne, one of the BBC's most experienced war reporters, has died at the age of 55 from a brain tumour

One of the BBC's most experienced war reporters has died at the age of 55 from a brain tumour.

Foreign correspondent Jon Leyne was diagnosed with an incurable brain tumour earlier this year after suffering from severe headaches while on a posting in Cairo.

He was one of the BBC's most experienced journalists and had covered numerous wars around the world over three decades.

Following the news of his death, some of the BBC's biggest names were quick to pay tribute on Twitter.

Former royal correspondent Jennie Bond said: 'So sad to hear my old friend and colleague Jon Leyne has died.

'He was a wonderful, kind and gifted correspondent.'

Political editor Nick Robinson added: 'Very sad to hear that the BBC's reporter Jon Leyne - whose reports from Cairo were so excellent - has died.'

Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine also paid tribute. He said: 'How sad to hear of the death of Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent who was thorough, indefatigable and such a friendly guy.'

Mr Leyne joined the BBC in 1985. In the early 1990s he worked as UN correspondent before going on to report from the MIddle East, Europe and Washington.

The reporter had a lucky escape in 2001 when he worked as US state department correspondent.

He was based close to the Pentagon when the building was attacked on September 11.

Recently, he covered the Egyptian revolution and the Libyan uprising against Col Muammar Gaddafi.

During the 2009 Iranian elections, the authorities in Tehran asked Mr Leyne to leave the country within 24 hours after Britain and the BBC were accused of meddling in internal affairs.

Mr Leyne was working in Cairo earlier this year when he was forced to return to Britain early following severe headaches.

It was on his return that he was diagnosed with an incurable brain tumour.

Speaking to the BBC, the acting 
director of BBC News, Fran Unsworth, said: 'Jon was a brave and 
courageous journalist in the best traditions of the BBC.

'He had an insatiable curiosity and told complex stories in an engaging and accessible way.'
