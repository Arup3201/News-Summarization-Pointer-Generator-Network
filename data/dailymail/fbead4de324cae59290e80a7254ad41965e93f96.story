Cricket Australia has announced a range of tributes to honour the late Phillip Hughes ahead of Tuesday's first Test against India in Adelaide.

The Australia players will wear Hughes' Test cap number 408 on their shirts for the match. Players and team management will also wear black armbands.

Prior to the start of play, the Australia and India teams will stand before a large '408' painted on the playing surface as they observe a video tribute to Hughes narrated by former Australia Test captain Richie Benaud.

Following the tribute, which will be displayed on the Adelaide Oval's vision screens, the teams and spectators will be asked to stand for 63 seconds of applause in recognition of Hughes' final unbeaten score.

'It has been an incredibly sad time since Phillip's passing,' CA chief executive James Sutherland said.

'With the international season re-commencing on Tuesday, it is appropriate to pause once more and honour a modest hero who thrilled the nation and in so doing won an enduring place in our hearts.

'We hope that the whole cricket community can come together to join the Australian and Indian teams in the pre-match tribute.'

Hughes died on November 27 - two days after being struck on the head by a bouncer while batting for South Australia against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Sutherland continued: 'Soon after arriving in Adelaide, Phillip became a crowd favourite playing for Australia, South Australia and the Adelaide Strikers.

'This is an opportunity for those that embraced him so fondly to say goodbye.

'We hope that followers of the game will make their way to Adelaide Oval to pay tribute to Phillip and support the Australian team at a difficult time.'

The South Australian Cricket Association has advised that the temporary memorial to Hughes, established in the Southern Plaza of the Adelaide Oval, will be maintained for the Test match.

Adelaide's Advertiser newspaper will also publish a commemorative lift-out featuring the words 'Phillip Hughes 63 not out' for patrons to display at the match.
