London Welsh have signed Wales rugby league star Elliot Kear from Bradford.

The 25-year-old claimed 17 tries in 55 Super League appearances across three seasons at the Bulls, but will now jump straight into the Exiles' Aviva Premiership relegation dogfight.

The promoted outfit have suffered seven straight league defeats and are already eight points behind closest rivals Newcastle in the early standings.

Kear scored for Welsh in a 64-0 pre-season friendly victory over Henley, and now head coach Justin Burnell believes he will make a quick impact at the Old Deer Park club.

'Elliot had some excellent performances for Bradford in the Super League last year and won numerous man-of-the-match awards, most notably against Wigan,' said Burnell.

'He's got a lot of pace and he's a fantastic addition to our squad.'

Kear admitted his Welsh move allows him to realise a long-held ambition to cross codes.

The 15-cap Wales league international said the Exiles remain adamant they can still beat the drop, ahead of hosting Leicester at Oxford's Kassam Stadium on Sunday.

London Welsh head coach Justin Burnell described the signing of Kear as a 'fantastic addition'

'I've always wanted to play rugby union and to have signed for London Welsh and to play at the highest level is definitely something I've wanted to do for a long time,' he said.

'Hopefully now I can take my chance and be the best I can be. Everyone is extremely focused at London Welsh and everyone has the view that we can still stay up - it only takes a few results.

'That's what we're searching for now, a result, and hopefully we can get that on the weekend.'
