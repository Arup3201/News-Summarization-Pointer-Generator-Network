A satanic group which planned to hold a black mass at Harvard University has been forced to take the event off-campus after thousands signed a petition against the service.

The Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club originally planned to hold the event, conducted by the Satantic Temple of New York, in the basement of the school's Memorial Hall on Monday.

The student group dropped sponsorship of the event it was scheduled to happen though, following protests from Catholics on campus and in Boston.

Making themselves heard: Catholics on campus and in Boston found the idea of a black mass offensive and staged demonstrations against it Monday evening

Many outlets reported that the event had been cancelled completely, because the temple couldn't find an off-campus location to host the service.

But they eventually worked out a deal with the Hong Kong restaurant on Harvard Square and posted on their Facebook page that the event would take place 'within the hour' around 10:30pm.

Last week, the cultural studies club caused controversial when they announced plans to host a historical re-enactment of a black mass.

Controversial: Satanic Temple, a Satanist group that attracted attention earlier this year after it proposed the placement of a seven-foot tall statue of Satan (pictured) next to an existing Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma

It said the event was intended to be educational and would be preceded by a lecture on the history and origins of the black mass, a ritual that parodies the Catholic mass, in which bread and wine are consecrated and consumed.

The re-enactment was set to be performed by the Satanic Temple, a Satanist group that attracted attention earlier this year after it proposed the placement of a seven-foot tall statue of Satan next to an existing Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma.

'Our purpose is not to denigrate any 
religion or faith, which would be repugnant to our educational purposes,
 but instead to learn and experience the history of different cultural 
practices,' the club said.

The
 announcement sparked outrage across campus and even in Boston proper, 
with the Archdiocese issuing a statement saying the activity 'places 
participants dangerously close to destructive works of evil'.

Harvard
 President Drew Faust even condemned the event as 'abhorrent', but said 
the university would not cancel the service so as to protect freedom of 
speech.

'Vigorous and open 
discussion and debate are essential to the pursuit of knowledge, and we 
must uphold these values even in the face of controversy,' President 
Faust said in a statement Monday.Â 

'Freedom
 of expression, as Justice [Oliver Wendell] Holmes famously said long 
ago, protects not only free thought for those who agree with us but 
freedom for the thought that we hate,' she added.

But many on campus were not pleased with Faust's decision to let the service go on.

Rhodes
 scholar Aurora Griffin started a petition and eventually got over 
60,000 signatures from students, alumni and faculty in support of 
banning the service from campus.

'I am ashamed that my university is allowing such a hateful event to happen under the auspices of "education"' Griffin, the former president of Harvard's Catholic Student Association, told the Boston Globe.

The Archdiocese protested the event by holding a Eucharistic procession Monday night, culminating in a holy hour at St Paul's Church which was attended by President Faust.

The Catholic Action League of Massachusetts held their own demonstration with a 'Rosary of Reparation' event outside Memorial Hall - where the black mass was originally set to take place.

'It is unimaginable that Harvard would have permitted such an obscene parody of the sacred rites of another religion,' C.J. Doyle, the league's executive director, said in a statement earlier Monday. 'Anti- Catholicism, however, remains a respectable prejudice.'

However, the student group that originally sponsored the event thinks it has been misinterpreted.

'We are disappointed by the self-righteousness of those who conspire to silence others simply because they claim offense,' The Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club said in a statement Monday night. 'It is also profoundly disturbing to see an entity erroneously labeled as a hate group because people do not share their faith or take the time to understand their beliefs or the meanings behind their rituals.'
