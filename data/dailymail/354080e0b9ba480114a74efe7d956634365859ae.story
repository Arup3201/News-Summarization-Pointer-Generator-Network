A 93-year-old World War II veteran who left high school to enlist in the Army has finally received his diploma.

Domenic Giarrusso was honored Thursday with a ceremony and received the qualification he would have received when he quit to join the war effort in 1940.

During hid service he worked as an airplane mechanic and earned his GED when he returned to Rhode Island. But he didn't have a graduation ceremony.

As his daughter and grandson looked on in the library at Cranston High School West, Giarrusso was handed the framed document by Providence School Supt. Susan Lusi.

She told him his degree was earned not only in the classroom but in the experience of his life.

After the brief ceremony, Giarrusso said he's come 'full circle in life. Life is complete.'

'I enlisted into the service because I felt that there was a job that needed to be done.",' he told ABC 6. 

His work with airplanes has left him hard of hearing but as he flashed his still mint condition bomber jacket for reports it was clear his hear and spirit were still strong.

Before receiving the diploma he gave the school a special talk about his wartime experience.

Though his daughter and grandson were there, his wife was sadly not.  

'My wife passed away two and a half years ago which I miss greatly. Wish she were here,' he said. 

Grandson Steve Giarrusso called it a proud moment.

'I hear all the stories of him being in the service, not so much from when he was in school; now I know why. And so very proud of him to have it come full circle for him,' he said. 

The elder Giarrusso left students with some words of wisdom.

'It's not about me; it's we. We gotta depend on each other to accomplish things,' he said.
