A former stockbroker accused of misappropriating at least $1 million has vanished as surely as his client's money.

Adviser Eric William Johnson, 51, is nowhere to be found as authorities say he made 115 wire transfers from his client's accounts to his own between the years 2004 and 2014.

He was discharged by Chicago broker-dealer RedRidge Securities in September.  

Adviser Eric William Johnson, 51, of Chicago's RedRidge Securities is nowhere to be found as authorities say he made 115 wire transfers from his client's accounts to his own between the years 2004 and 2014

The firm is a boutique brokerage house which Johnson ran with David Brent Hurt.

Prior to joining RedRidge Johnson was registered with multiple firms, two of which were expelled by FINRA's predecessor, the NASD.

Hurt said Johnson's dismissal was due to the allegations. 

'Sadly, the termination was for cause as we have reason to believe he violated several securities regulations. The violations, though serious, were isolated to five accounts out of the hundreds we manage,' he said.  

On Wall Street reports that Johnson has been permanently banned from the industry. 

The SEC has charged Johnson with violations of the Securities Exchange Act and the Investment Advisers Act.

His attorney, Thomas Leinenweber, says he cannot speak to his client's guilt or whereabouts. 

'We can't commit on the substance of investigations that are ongoing but he is cooperating with authorities to the extent that he can,' Leinenweber said. 

Johnson reportedly concealed the theft by using computers that were not associated with his name or account. 

It's not yet certain what became of the cash. 

The FBI is reportedly investigating criminal charges but agency representatives have declined to comment on the situation, according to Business Insider.

'We are confident this is an isolated incident affecting seven of the hundreds of clients we manage," Hurt said. 'We await the results from the regulatory authorities and of course we will comply fully with their recommended actions.'
