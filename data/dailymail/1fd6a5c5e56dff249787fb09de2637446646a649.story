My five-year-old daughter, Lara, caused something of a stir at the school gates last week as she waltzed in with a canvas rucksack slung across her shoulders.

Because this was no ordinary rucksack. This was Chanel’s highly sought-after canvas graffiti backpack, designed by creative director Karl Lagerfeld for  his Pop Art collection, modelled at  Paris Fashion Week by model of the moment, Cara Delevingne, and, despite the eye-watering price of £2,100, already a sell-out.

Except it wasn’t. What sort of a mother do you think I am? I would no more buy my daughter a Chanel bag  than I would buy her a pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos.

This was, in fact, a fake.

But I don’t like the term fake — it conjures up images of nasty backstreet market stalls and ill-gotten gains funding drug cartels. I prefer to think of this as a carefully crafted, handmade homage.

Let me explain. When I saw the pictures of this coveted and unattainable item I thought I must be mistaken. Rather than being the elegant leather accessory Chanel is famous for, this resembles the kind of customised and grubby backpack touted around by particularly scruffy school children.

But cooler and richer people clearly disagree. Twilight star Kristen Stewart was spotted in Paris in March carrying  a black version of the backpack, complete with her trademark skinny jeans and sneakers.

In a magnificent truism, Lagerfeld  said of the collection that spawned the bag: ‘Life is not a red carpet. This is for daily life.’

But of course, because we all drag  £2,100 backpacks round Sainsbury’s, don’t we?

Frankly, this bag looked like it had been made by a five-year-old. Which, of course, made me wonder: Could a five-year-old make it? I decided to find out.

Lara was up for the challenge, so I scoured the internet to find a basic bag that we could customise. I finally found a plain beige canvas rucksack on Amazon.co.uk, costing just £7 — which would buy me approximately one third of a Chanel lipgloss (£22).

For the all-important Chanel logo, Helen McLaughlin, editor of new magazine Love Sewing, advises I use freezer paper. This is sold by craft shops, and is ordinary paper on one side and has a thin plastic coating on the other. This means that when you iron the plain side, it sticks to fabric.

Using a cereal bowl and a mug as a template for the concentric circles that make up the interlinking ‘C’s, Lara draws the design on to the freezer paper, carefully cuts it out and I then iron the two ‘C’s on to the bag.

We are amazed at how authentic it looks. I wonder where this might lead — Lara and I could do pencil cases and wash bags for the next school fete and make our fortune.

I’m just taking the top off the red paint, a leftover from one of the children’s art projects, when we’re interrupted by a very cross voice. It’s my husband, Justin.

‘Don’t use spray paint in the kitchen,’ he thunders. ‘Go outside. On the grass.’

I bet Coco Chanel never got yelled at mid-creation.

Out in the garden, we gently spray the paints on in layers  of brown, then red, then green and finally the beige, and then use some of the children’s  stencils to write the words, ‘31 Rue Cambon’.

The bag only cost £7 to make but Alice (left) admits: 'If we were less of an artsy-crafty 
family, we might not have had everything we needed and I would have had 
to spend about £50 on materials.' Pictured: Lara (right)

Now, we have to make the — frankly messy looking — rope of tangled cord and carabiners, those weird hooks used by mountaineers, and, fortuitously, my husband for securing his bike to the car.

Why on earth they are on a fashion backpack is beyond me.

I task Lara with plaiting and twisting a load of polyester cords that I bought from a craft shop, and then, to make the final, smaller Chanel ‘C’s in silver and white, we draw around a pepperpot and then outline the edges of the ‘C’s with a silver pen.

We are shamelessly pleased with the final result and  prance around like delighted show ponies.

My husband, who has been sniggering as he watches us painstakingly plait, spray and glue, is genuinely impressed. (OK, his exact words were: ‘It’s really good, I thought it was going to be rubbish.’)

I have a host of arty friends whom I text with a picture of the bag. They are similarly wowed — one claims not to be able to tell the difference at all. I’m pretty sure that everyone (myself included) assumed  that this project was going to be a disaster.

If we were less of an artsy-crafty family, we might not have had everything we needed and I would have had to spend about £50 on materials.

Still, that’s about one fortieth of the retail price of the real thing.

Now all we need is for some sap to offer more than £2,100  for our version, and we really  will be laughing all the way to the bank.

But not as much as Chanel, who have created a bag so simple that even a five-year-old can make a convincing copy.
