A college professor who plotted to blow up the Polish parliament may have murdered his mother when she found out about his plans, police believe.

Polish police announced yesterday that the body of a woman found in a shallow grave in national park woodland is that of Brunon Kwiecien's mother Julita Kotas.

Detectives are now investigating whether Kwiecien killed her when she discovered he was plotting to detonate a four tonne bomb outside parliament and kill both the country's president and prime minister.

Kwiecien, who worshipped Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik, was arrested in Krakow in November where he was found with four tonnes of explosives, detonators and a handgun.

He planned to rig a truck as a giant bomb and then ram through security fences around the Polish parliament.

The right-wing chemist also had Hexogen T$, the highest grade of military plastic explosive.

Other items included detonators, mobile phone bomb triggers, firearms and live ammunition, said prosecutor Mariusz Krason.

He was put under surveillance by Poland's secret service and then arrested after his biologist wife alerted police.

She had become concerned when he starting quizzing her about which diseases and pathogens would be the most lethal.

Reports also suggested his students at
Krakow's Agricultural University raised concerns after he ranted about 
the amount of control the state has over ordinary life and about the 'need to 
replace state authorities and take action.'

The
body of his mother was discovered in April in Ojcow but it was not 
until yesterday that officials announced it was Kwiecien's mother.

Investigators had been told she moved to Britain but tests have confirmed it to be his mother.

The confirmation follows media reports
last week that blood had been found in the woman's house in the village
of Lednica Gorna south of Krakow.

The professor - facing bomb-making and terrorism charges - is now also being quizzed over his mother's death.

'We don't know the motive at the moment. 
Maybe she found out what he was planning, or maybe he thought that as he
planned to die anyway, one more killing wouldn't matter,' said one 
police source.

Kwiecien was a fan of Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik and told undercover police investigating him he would not have made the sane 'mistakes' as his hero.

After his arrest prosecutors said Kwiecien was a nationalist and an anti-Semite and he believed the country was going in the wrong direction because of the 'foreigners' in government departments.

Last week Kwiecien made a statement through his lawyers confirming that he had planned to blow up parliament because of his hatred of politicians in general.

Mr Krason said after the arrest: 'Simply put he believed society and the economic situation were moving in the wrong direction due to all government posts and positions of power being held by what he described as "foreigners"—not true Poles.

'He said he belonged to a nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-Semitic movement.'

He had previously boasted of plans to use deadly germ warfare sprays to kill hundreds of people and said he wanted to be 'bigger than Breivik', according to Polish reports.

Breivik murdered 77 people in 2011 when 
he bombed government buildings in Oslo before carrying out a mass 
shooting at camp of the Workers' Youth League.

Investigators say Kwiecien made reconnaissance trips to Parlament Sejm in Poland and studied the route for President Bronislaw Komorowski's Independence Day march earlier this month

A Polish television investigation into the plot was told by a source: 'He said that Breivik made mistakes, which he would not repeat, because he would be better.'

Officials say he had made reconnaissance visits to government buildings in Warsaw.

He is also understood to have studied the area around Poland's parliament, as well as the route marked out for President Bronislaw Komorowski's Independence Day march earlier this month.

Stunned staff at the university where he worked said they were shocked when the plot emerged.

College rector Professor Włodzimierz Sady said: 'He was an average worker, not outstanding. We are all very shocked.'

One childhood neighbour told local media that the professor had always been obsessed with explosives and had lost several fingers in an accidental blast.

'He was always playing with homemade bombs and lost a few fingers,' he said
