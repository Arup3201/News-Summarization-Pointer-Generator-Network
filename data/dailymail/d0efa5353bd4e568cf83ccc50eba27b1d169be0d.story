After playing a major part in Anderlecht's dramatic comeback against Arsenal in the Champions League, you can't blame Anthony Vanden Borre for wanting to read all about in the morning papers.

On a rollercoaster night which saw Arsenal crumble and throw away a three-goal lead at the Emirates Stadium, Vanden Borre took the chance to catch up with the worldly goings on in our very own Daily Mail newspaper.

As the Anderlecht defender scrambled in the opening goal for the visitors on Tuesday night, everything seemed to fall into place for the Belgian champions and Vanden Borre would have liked what he saw on this morning's back pages.

It was a memorable night for the Belgian side and when Vanden Borre scored their first from an Andy Kawaya cross, a huge sense of nervousness swept through the Emirates home crowd.

The former Portsmouth player, who was famously the subject of a Chris Kamara blooper, was then called upon to edge the visitors closer, and did the trick when he beat Wojciech Szczesny from the penalty spot in the 73rd minute.

Anderlecht's night was then topped off when the spritely Aleksandar Mitrovic headed home in the final minute to send the 3,000 travelling fans into raptures.
