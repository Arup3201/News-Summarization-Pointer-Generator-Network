Prince Harry has said it is 'easy to forget' who he is in the Army in a candid interview ahead of his return to the UK

There is only one rule as far as the soldier prince is concerned: Work hard, play hard.

But in one of the most candid admissions of his interview, Harry remarks that a concerned Prince Charles frequently attempts to remind him of what is required of the third in line to the throne.

Harry confesses he ‘let himself and his family down’ after being photographed cavorting naked in Las Vegas last year, but, unsurprisingly given his comments, is largely unrepentant.

The 28-year-old royal concedes he should have acted in a more ‘princely’ manner but says the media should never have published ‘private’ photos of him playing strip billiards with a group of women he had met in his hotel bar.

Like many headstrong young men, Harry says he shrugs off his father’s wise words of caution, even if he is heir to the throne. ‘My father’s always trying to remind me about who I am and stuff like that. But it’s very easy to forget about who I am when I am in the Army. Everyone’s wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing,’ he says.

‘I have always said work hard, play hard. I will always be enjoying the job … however long it may carry on for, and then I have the other job to fall back on.’

He adds: ‘Certain people remind me, “Remember who you are, so don’t always drop your guard”. At the end of the day I probably let myself down [in Vegas], I let my family down, I let other people down.

‘But I was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect. Back at home all my close friends rallied around me and were great.

‘It was probably a classic case of me being too much Army and not enough prince. It’s a simple case of that.’

The leaked pictures were taken on a 
riotous boys-only pre-deployment holiday to Vegas last summer, weeks 
before he flew out to Afghanistan.

They show a naked Harry cupping his 
genitals as he hugs an unnamed blonde, who is also nude.

The pair had 
apparently been playing a game of strip billiards.

It is believed the 
photos, sold to a US entertainment website, were taken by one of the 
guests invited back to his £5,000-a-night suite in the Wynn Hotel.

Their publication provoked a debate 
over whether Harry violated his own privacy in showing such a lapse of 
judgment, and raised questions over the role of his taxpayer-funded 
Scotland Yard protection officers.

Although the pictures were seen around
 the world, his solicitors threatened action against any UK newspaper 
that published them.

Only one, the Sun, chose to do so but St James’s 
Palace took no further action. Harry, however, says it is ‘unacceptable’
 that anything was published, knowing that he was about to be deployed.

‘Yes people might look at it going, 
“Yes it was letting off steam, it’s all understandable now, he was going
 off to Afghanistan”.

'Well, the papers knew that I was going out to 
Afghanistan anyway, so the way I was treated by them I don’t think is 
acceptable.’

Harry openly admits that one of the 
reasons he likes his job as an Apache pilot so much is that it takes him
 away from the media interest.

But he says that being in the Royal 
Family requires both himself and his brother to constantly ‘flick a 
switch’ between their different personas.

‘There are three “me”s – one 
in the Army, one sort of socially in my own private time, and then one 
with the family and stuff like that,’ he says.

‘No one back home gets to see the 
stuff that I do while I’m at work and there’s no reason why they 
should... So whenever anybody sees me they presume that I’m off 
gallivanting around.’

Although he repeatedly says he 
‘doesn’t want to whinge’, Harry lays the blame for his ‘bad boy’ public 
person at the feet of the media.

‘My father always says, “Don’t read 
it, it’s rubbish” [but] I am surprised how many people in the UK do 
actually read it. Of course, if something is written about me I want to 
know what is said,’ he says.

‘I don’t believe there is such a thing
 as a private life any more ... I am not going to sit here and whinge 
[but] there’s the internet, there’s Twitter.

'Everyone’s phone has a 
camera on it now. You can’t move an inch without people judging you, 
that’s the way life goes.’

Asked how far his mistrust of the 
media goes back, Harry says sharply: ‘I think it’s fairly obvious how 
far back it goes. It’s when I was very small.’

But he adds: ‘But at least I have a job, many other people don’t.’
