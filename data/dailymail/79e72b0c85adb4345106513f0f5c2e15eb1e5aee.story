Busted: Kirsty Hartley outside Bristol Crown Court, following her arrest for cultivating cannabis

A mother-of-two was arrested after she turned her bedroom into a cannabis farm - so she could afford to pay for breast enhancements.

Kirsty Hartley, 23, allowed drug dealers to set up a £16,000 drug factory in her bedroom after he promised her £8,000 to spend on cosmetic surgery.

But she was arrested after police raided her home in Bristol and found 32 cannabis plants growing there.

Bristol Crown Court heard Hartley had been promised the money by a drug dealer if she allowed him to grow the plants, capable of producing drugs with a potential street value of £16,000.

She pleaded guilty to producing cannabis at an earlier hearing.

Hartley occasionally watered the cannabis plants and tended them when the drug dealer behind the 'sophisticated' drugs factory was unable to do so, the court heard.

But the cultivation of the plants swiftly came to an end when police raided the property and seized the drugs and cannabis-growing equipment on December 12 last year.

Natural light had been blocked from the room and there was a high-powered light, fans and air filters set up to help the plants grow.

At Bristol Magistrates’ Court earlier this month, May Li, prosecuting, said: 'In police interview Miss Hartley said she was offered £8,000 to have the crop in her bedroom.

'She initially refused but he persisted and she gave in.

'She said she had issues with her body and desperately wanted a boob job.'

At Wednesday’s sentencing Robert Reid, prosecuting, said the plants could have yielded 1.6kg of cannabis, with a street value of £10 per gram deal.

Mr Reid said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the man who had asked Hartley to grow the cannabis in her home.

He said Hartley had only one previous offence on her record, a reprimand for being drunk and disorderly when she was 16.

Dianne Heys, mitigating, said her client was an unsophisticated offender who was immature and suffering from depression.

She said Hartley was pressured into committing the offence and was told she would receive £8,000 if the mission of growing the drugs to maturity was accomplished.

Ms Heys said: 'She watered the plants only on a couple of occasions and clearly she was engaged by pressure and coercion.'

Recorder Peter Towler gave Hartley an 18-month community order, with a year’s supervision by the probation service.

He told her: 'People who cultivate the illegal drugs are almost at the top of the tree because, if they don’t, people wouldn’t have drugs to distribute down the chain.

'You succumbed to this individual, who wanted to use a room in your house to grow cannabis.'
