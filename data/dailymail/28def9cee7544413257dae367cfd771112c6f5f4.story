Bill Gates, pictured last week, was once again named the world's richest person with a wealth of $79.2 billion 

For the world's super-rich, 2015 is already shaping up to be a good year as the number of billionaires reached a record high.

There were 1,826 billionaires this year, up from 1,645 in 2014, according to Forbes.

And the world's richest person got even richer. Bill Gates's net worth rose to $79.2 billion in 2015 from $76 billion last year.

The Microsoft co-founder's fortune increased $3.2 billion - despite a $1.5 billion gift of Microsoft shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in November.

That put him at the top of the magazine's list of the world's billionaires for the second consecutive year. 

Gates has topped the list for 16 of the last 21 years.

In second place is telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu, with a net worth of $77.1 billion. He had topped the list in 2013.

Next is investor Warren Buffett, who moved up one slot this year with a net worth of $72.7 billion.

In fourth was Amancio Ortega, founder of the Inditex fashion group that includes Zara clothing retail shops. He counts a fortune of $64.5 billion. 

Seven of the richest people in the world are from the U.S. Completing the top ten is Helu, of Mexico, Amancio Ortega of Spain who built his wealth with retail chain Zara and French L'Oreal heiress, Liliane Bettencourt. 

It's the 29th year for Forbes billionaires' list.

Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg jumped five spots to number 16, his first time in the world's 20 richest people. 

Jack Ma, whose Alibaba online marketplace made the biggest global IPO ever last year, was ranked among the world's 50 richest people, along with two other Chinese nationals. 

This year's newcomers included Michael Jordan who was ranked at No. 1,741.

The average net worth of those on the list was $3.86 billion. And those under the age of 40 took up 46 places on the list. 

Snapchat's Evan Spiegel, 24, is the world's youngest billionaire while Uber co-founders, Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, and their first employee, Ryan Graves, also made up the under-40s group.

In the 1950s she married Andre Bettencourt, who also worked at L'Oreal after being involved in a French fascist group that collaborated with Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II.

He died in 2007 after leaving L'Oreal in the midst of revelations about his past.
