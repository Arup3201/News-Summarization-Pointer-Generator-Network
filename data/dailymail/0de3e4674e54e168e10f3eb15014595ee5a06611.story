No parole: Ohio kidnapper Ariel Castro enters the courtroom in Cleveland

David Cameron was yesterday accused of planning to 'kow-tow'  to European human rights judges and scrap the country's toughest  jail sentences.

So-called 'whole-life' terms, which condemn the most dangerous serial killers to die behind bars, could be replaced by 'US-style, 100-year terms'.

But crucially, unlike many states in the US, the new sentences in Britain will come with an automatic review – potentially allowing murderers who would otherwise have stayed in jail to be released back on to the streets.

The proposal has infuriated Tory backbenchers. Last night Peter Bone said: 'The trouble with 100-year sentences is they can be reviewed and reduced and people could be let out. For certain people, life should mean life – in prison for the rest of their lives.'

Downing Street is set to change the law to comply with a European Court of Human Rights judgment, which found life sentences without any prospect of parole amounted to a breach of killers' human rights.

In July, the court ruled all inmates, however long their sentences, should have a chance at proving they have changed their ways and are no longer a threat to the public.

Without a review mechanism, such sentences amounted to 'inhuman and degrading treatment' and breached Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the judges said.

When the ruling was released, Mr Cameron's spokesman said the Prime Minister 'profoundly disagreed' and was a 'strong supporter of whole-life tariffs'. But less than six months later he appears ready to bow to Strasbourg's demands.

Yesterday Mr Cameron tried to appear tough on the issue. He told BBC News: 'What I think is very clear, there are some people who commit such dreadful crimes that they should be sent to prison and life should mean life. Whatever the European court has said, we must put in place arrangements to make sure that can continue.'

But he failed to rule out changes to the 'whole-life' regime, which is reserved for killers and rapists deemed so depraved they can never be let out. In the US, many criminals are given lengthy sentences with no chance of release.

Last year Ohio kidnapper and rapist Ariel Castro was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 1,000 years without parole. He was later found dead in his cell.

Last night pressure was mounting on Mr Cameron.

Mr Bone said: 'We should ignore the ruling of this Mickey Mouse court in Strasbourg and do what the British people want.'

Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: 'The abolition of whole-life sentences is a backward step. This proposal means that every murderer, no matter how grotesque their crimes, has an automatic right to parole hearings. What is the point of having elections if governments always end up kow-towing to the European Court of Human Rights?'

The Strasbourg case was brought by three convicted killers given whole-life sentences who demanded the right to a parole hearing – Jeremy Bamber, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore. There 52 individuals serving such terms.

The Strasbourg court said all must be allowed a review of their sentence, with release following if they can prove they have been successfully 'rehabilitated'. It suggested the whole-lifers should be given a review after 25 years inside and every few years afterwards.

There is also pressure to amend the law from senior judges. In October, Mr Justice Sweeney said it was 'not appropriate' to give  triple killer Ian McLoughlin a whole-life sentence because of the Strasbourg decree.

The same judge is due to sentence the Woolwich killers of Lee Rigby – Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.
