White Dee has hit out at boob job call girl Josie Cunningham, insisting her behaviour brings shame on 'genuine' benefits claimants.

Benefits Street star Dee branded the wannabe glamour model 'absolutely pathetic' and an 'attention seeker' in a rant on internet radio yesterday.

She said Cunningham, famed for demanding a £4,800 breast operation on the NHS, made her 'so cross'.

Dee, 42, told online radio station Fubar: 'This is obviously someone who is seeking publicity but, I just cannot work it out, she's going about it in the wrong way.'

Mum-of-two Dee, real name Diedre Kelly, reacted furiously when told Cunningham has tweeted: 'Sticks and stones will break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me'.

Dee responded: 'That is just absolutely pathetic. Things like that are just going to get the backs up of people, the genuine people who do need benefits. I'm cross.'

Dee, who has been on handouts for five years after she was sacked by her local council in Birmingham, added: 'I could talk about her for hours.'

The 
reality TV star hit out after pregnant Cunningham, 23, revealed she 
sends her children to school in taxpayer-funded taxis and turned to 
drink and cigarettes after finding out her unborn baby is a boy.

Dee also 
revealed that her controversial trips to Majorca, in which she has been 
seen downing cocktails, are work and not a holiday.

But she insisted she could not take on a 
full-time job as she still has bouts of depression.

Dee was left furious after hearing how Cunningham (pictured) tweeted: 'Sticks and stones will break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.'

Dee said: 'I don't know anyone who has to publicly declare what they are earning, what they are on. As long as my conscience is clear then that's all that matters.'

The mother-of-two hit back at those who claim she should now start working full-time, insisting she is still has 'mental health issues' after the death of her mother two years ago.

She added: 'Just because I'm in the public eye, it doesn't automatically make me better. I have to take it one day at a time.

'It's hard to get over the death of anybody and I'm still seeing specialists because they are still trying to work out the correct medication. So it's work in progress.'

Dee also renewed her claims that the system was to blame for how much she is paid by the state and insisted she has not scammed any benefits and has only claimed what she is entitled to.

She added: 'I seem to be the person that is to blame for the whole of the benefits system. But it's the government that needs to look at it. If people want to blame me than, by all means, give me the Prime Minister's job.'

Photos of Dee downing shots and cocktails at a 'Carnage Magaluf' night earlier this year sparked fury in the UK

But she insisted that it is nobody's business how she spends her time and said she is still too ill to work
