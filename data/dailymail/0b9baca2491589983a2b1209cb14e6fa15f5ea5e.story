Neymar was back in training with the Brazil national team less than 24hours after playing in Barcelona's 'El Clasico' defeat over  Real Madrid on Sunday.

The Catalans opened up a four-point lead over their arch rivals at the top of La Liga following Sunday's 2-1 victory at the Nou Camp.

While former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez stole the headlines with his winning goal, Neymar cut a more subdued figure - missing an early opportunity that led to Madrid breaking away and equalising through Cristiano Ronaldo.

The Selecao have travelled to France to play an international friendly against the former World Cup winner on Thursday with Neymar expected to play a leading role at the Stade de France just outside Paris.

The 23-year-old, who has scored 42 goals in 60 appearances for Brazil, joined teammates including PSG captain Thiago Silva and Chelsea threesome Oscar, Felipe Luiz and Willian at the Charlety Stadium for a training session.

Coach Dunga has won all of his six matches since taking control of the Brazil team for the second time in July, just days after Brazil were dumped out their own World Cup 7-1 by Germany.

Other Premier League players called up to the Brazil squad are Fernandinho of Manchester City and Liverpool playmaker Phillipe Coutinho. 

Former Brazil international Roberto Dinamite, who was president of Vasco da Gama when the club sold Coutinho to Inter Milan, believes the 22-year-old will wear the Brazil No 10 shirt for years to come.

'He already stood out when he left Vasco. And he is fulfilling his potential at Liverpool. He has that Brazilian talent, honed and developed in Europe, and he will keep getting better,' he said.

Meanwhile, Arsenal's new signing Gabriel Paulista hopes his debut call up, after the late withdrawal of PSG defenders David Luiz and Marquinos through injury, will be the first of many.

The central defender will feel at home if he plays in Brazil's second friendly against Chile on Sunday as it is due to be staged at the Gunners' Emirates Stadium.

He told the Arsenal website: 'I am very happy with the news, and it is a dream for any player to wear the shirt of your country.

'I'll play the best possible way. It is a valuable opportunity and I hope that is the first call of many.
