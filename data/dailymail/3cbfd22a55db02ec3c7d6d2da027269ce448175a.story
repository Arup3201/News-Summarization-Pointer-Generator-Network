More than a decade since their last tour, Culture Club’s reunion shows have been awaited with great anticipation.

But fans will have to wait a little longer before seeing the band take to the stage as the concerts have been cancelled due to Boy George’s health.

The singer, whose real name is George O’Dowd, 53, has said he is ‘devastated’ to call off the tour but has been forced to due to a serious throat infection.

Culture Club, pictured, Mikey Craig, left, Roy Hay, centre, and Boy George, right, were planning a reunion tour but were forced to cancel after the lead singer, real name George O'Dowd, developed a throat complaint 

It is believed he could be suffering from vocal polyps that require surgery, the same condition that has previously forced Adele to cancel shows.

The band – which had 12 top 40 hits in the 1980s and 90s – were due to perform in front of a sold out crowd at the Agua Caliente Casino in Rancho Mirage, California tomorrow.

However, some tickets holders received an automated call this informing them the show had been cancelled, which has since been confirmed by the band.

A spokesman for the group said: ‘It is with great sadness that iconic band Culture Club have had to cancel their December UK tour.

‘The tough decision has been made due to lead singer Boy George suffering from a serious throat condition, for which medical treatment is currently underway.’

And the singer himself added: ‘I’m devastated but I want to be able to perform to the best of my ability and the specialist has told me that right now that will be impossible. I will focus on getting better and see all my fans soon’.

Boy George is believed to have developed polyps, which forced Adele, pictured to cancel several shows 

The group were due to play 10 shows across America before beginning an 11-date UK arena tour from 1 December.

It was to be the first tour featuring Boy George, bassist Mikey Craig, guitarist and keyboardist Roy Hay and drummer Jon Moss since 2002.

The group have already recorded a new album, Tribes, which is due to be released early next year.

A polyp is a fluid-filled collection that forms when a vocal cord if they are not rested. Other singers to have suffered from them include Bjork and Keith Urban.

Ticket holders can claim refunds from their point of purchase.
