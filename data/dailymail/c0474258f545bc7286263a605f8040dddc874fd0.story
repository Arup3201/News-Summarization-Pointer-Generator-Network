Michael Clarke is readying Australia for a tough test against Sri Lanka as the likely Pool A qualifiers jockey for quarter-final opponents.

Both teams can be confident, whatever the outcome in Sydney on Sunday, that they have obvious prospects of reaching the knockout stages.

Who they will face in the last eight is yet to be determined, however.

Captain Clarke stressed in his column for Australian tabloid, the Daily Telegraph, that the co-hosts must step up again after their run-fest victory over Afghanistan in Perth on Wednesday.

'Now we must maintain that same attention to detail against an experienced and talented Sri Lanka at the SCG, a game that will play a huge role in who we play against in the quarter-finals.

'Sri Lanka are high on confidence.

Clarke said his team-mates must step up again against Sri Lanka following their easy win over Afghanistan

'They've been playing some really good cricket, scoring a lot of runs and had a wonderful win against England.'

Sri Lanka chased more than 300 to beat England by nine wickets in Wellington last weekend, but are hampered in their preparations this time by injury issues.
