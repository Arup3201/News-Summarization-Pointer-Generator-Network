A woman, under the influence of marijuana, sliced a man’s genitals with a box cutter after accusing him of molesting her two-year-old son.

Bonita Lynn Vela, 35, was arrested after holding the 18-year-old man captive for three-and-a-half hours with the help of two others at a trailer park in Franklin, Indiana.

The man, believed to be the boyfriend of Vela’s daughter, told police that the woman was ‘out of control’ and ‘extremely mad’. He adamantly denied her accusations of molestation.

Vela admitted that she had smoked marijuana and was unsure whether she had taken any other drugs according to a Johnson County Sheriff report.

She told police that she had been at a friend’s house when she took the drugs and by 3 a.m. she became angry and demanded that one of her friends retrieve the 18-year-old to confront him.

Two people held the young man down as Vela threatened him, saying she would ask friends to ‘take him out’ with guns by tying him to a tree, shooting him in the head and leaving his body to be eaten by animals, the victim told police.

Vela then allegedly gave him an ultimatum – allow her to cut his penis or be killed or have his penis cut completely off.

According to the police report she said she ‘wanted to scar him so that he would have to look at it every time that he had sex in the future’. 

As the confrontation went on, Vela got increasingly angry, shouting at him to admit to the abuse of her son. He begged them not to call the police, denying her angry accusations.

She said that if ‘didn’t have anything to hide then he should let her “cut him”,’ and that whatever happened he was never come back.

The 18-year-old said he thought the trio would ‘go to great lengths to hurt or kill him’ and that one of them had filmed the incident which left him with a deep cut to the penis. 

Vela told investigators that she only meant to scare the young man and never intended to hurt him.

He was taken to Johnson Memorial Hospital for his injuries caused by the weapon, which is usually used to cut tape that holds boxes together.

Vela remains in the Johnson County Jail with $28,000 bond charged with criminal confinement with a deadly weapon and battery with a deadly weapon. 

No other arrests have been made but investigations into Vela’s molestation accusations are underway.
