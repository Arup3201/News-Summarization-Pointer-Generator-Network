A 11-year-old girl has missed four weeks of lessons after the school she had been offered a place at turned into a boys-only establishment without informing her mother.

Maddison Selwood, of Birmingham, was set to start at Hunters Hill Technology College this September, according to her mother, Cheryl Broadway. 

But when the 40-year-old rang to inquire about term starting dates and school uniforms she was shocked to discover that the college would only be accepting boys.

Mrs Broadway said special needs pupil Maddison, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and needs one-to-one teaching, was initially offered a place  back in April.

But by June the mother-of-four had not been contacted by the school.

She said: 'I hadn't been told about induction days or what school uniform to buy, which I thought was really odd. 

'So I called the school and they told me Maddison could no longer have a place there because it was about to be turned into a school for boys. 

The 11-year-old had been offered a place at Hunters Hill Technology College in April, according to her mother

'I was absolutely furious that nobody had thought to tell us and we had no idea where Maddison would be going to school.'

She said the 11-year-old was then offered a place at Spring Hill High School, in Erdington, in July - but could not start the new term this month as Birmingham City Council had failed to give the placement the rubber stamp of approval. 

Maddison is now due to start the school on Monday after weeks of wasting time at home. 

But the council's Special Educational Needs Assessment and Review Service has still not agreed to fund the transport to get her to and from the Erdington school. 

Mrs Broadway added: 'I am absolutely disgusted about this whole situation. 

'The council has made one blunder after another and it is inexcusable that Maddison has missed virtually a month of school.

'Her condition means that she doesn't cope well with change and this has all been a lot of upheaval and uncertainty for her.' 

A council spokesman said work was being done in a bid to ensure Maddison can start school on Monday. 

'Maddison was originally allocated a place at Hunters Hill, in line with parental preference,' he said. 

'However, following a change in circumstance, we have found an alternative placement in consultation with parent wishes. 

'Maddison is due to start her school place next week. We are currently working to resolve any issues relating to transport as quickly as possible.'
