Standing in Ploshtad Sveta Nedelya – the large square which spreads out at the heart of Sofia – I am momentarily unsure what year it is.

Behind me, the Holy Sunday Church is a swarthy slice of the 19th century – an Orthodox temple competing for souls with the 16th century Banya Bashi Mosque, which sits a few doors down.

In front, the broad facade of the TZUM department store is an austere reminder of the grim communist Fifties – even as it towers over the archaeological remains of the Roman settlement of Serdica, which are framed beyond glass at my feet. Only when the adjacent metro station bursts into life, disgorging a crowd of commuters, does the 21st century seem to feel present and correct.

A church to haunt a million postcards: The magnificent Aleksandar Nevski Cathedral is Sofia's landmark

Bulgaria's capital is rarely anybody's first suggestion for a mini-break. But, easily reached via a three-hour (direct) flight from London, it is deserving of closer attention – not least because few cities wear their past quite as openly as this fascinating little corner of eastern Europe.

Just about every dominant power that ever thrived on our home continent – ancient Greeks, road-building Romans, Ottoman Turks, the heavy hand of the Soviet Union – has had its say here at some point. The result is an intriguing cocktail of architectural styles and overlapping eras that is certain to delight more intrepid travellers.

Exploring the centre, I soon encounter the Aleksandar Nevski Cathedral.

Indeed, it is hard to miss Sofia’s keynote building. It is the sort of dreaming wonder of a church that, were it located in Paris, Rome or Barcelona, would gaze out from a million postcards.

In truth, it looks like it has escaped from Moscow – an epic, domed creation that was built between 1878 and 1912, at a time when Bulgaria was in thrall to Tsarist Russia. Its flanks are adorned with mosaics – while its interior, where the aroma of incense hangs thick in the air, is a feast of space.

It has a neighbour too, the smaller St Sophia – a humble red-brick pile that, remarkably, has occupied its site since the sixth century. Inside, medieval frescoes supply colour and beauty, saints peering piously at the observer.

Unknown quantity: Sofia is one of Europe's most historic cities, but is rarely on the tourist map

Sofia loves its churches – but it also revels in culture.

The Sofia City Art Gallery, with its 3500-strong cluster of contemporary works, is a treasure trove.

Yet the motherlode is the National Art Gallery. Pitched inside a former royal palace, this is a pleasing place to spend an afternoon, its many paintings hung in high-ceilinged chambers where the affairs of court once played out. The names of the painters whose pieces decorate the walls will not, perhaps, be familiar – but the striking landscapes and rural scenes crafted by Bulgarian luminaries like Anton Mitov and Vera Nedkova are eye-catching nonetheless.

Somewhat bizarrely, the National Museum of History is hidden four miles south-west of the centre, in the suburb of Boyana. You need to take a taxi to reach it – but the inconvenience is offset by the collection that awaits.

Bulgaria’s full tale is revealed here. The priceless Panagyurishte Treasure – a clutch of gold goblets from the fourth century BC – recalls the days when the area was part of the ancient Greek region of Thrace. Crusader swords and World War weaponry tell military stories of different vintages.

And the building regales you with the most dramatic yarn of all. This sturdy block of concrete, with its sweeping staircases and enormous rooms, was used for state events in the Iron Curtain epoch. There is still a distinct whiff of Bond villain’s lair to its angular bulkiness.

However, it would be wholly incorrect to say that Sofia exists in some sepia yesteryear. And you do not have to look too closely to see a vibrant, modern city of quiet confidence.

Trundling along: A tram rolls past the Tsentralni Halite market hall - where you can find quality wines

There are flashes of the now in the broad Tsentralni Halite. Sofia's main market hall may be a happy relic, dating to 1911, but the picture inside is decidedly up to date – a host of stalls selling organic olive oils and fruity bottles of Bulgaria's increasingly quaffable wines; a small bar where locals discuss the issues of the day over discreet glasses of beer.

This image blossoms on Vitosha Bulevard. Sofia's key drag is largely pedestrianised, and when I amble along it in late afternoon, a merry crowd is in evidence – families milling around the shops, worker bees heading for the hive of bars and cafes. It is not quite the Champs Elysées, but it hints at something that Paris cannot match.

At the south end, the mountain which gives the avenue its name can be glimpsed between the townhouses – Vitosha, wearing a cap of snow. The ski season at its two resorts – Konjarnika-Vetrovala and Aleko, both roughly half an hour away – usually runs between December and March.

Wandering further, I find myself in the leafy lanes to the rear of the National Art Gallery – where the ghosts of the communist decades are firmly exorcised by two splendid options for a night out.

With a menu heavy on cocktails and high-end bottles of whisky, Dada Cultural Bar is the sort of trendy watering hole that could comfortably exist in any great global metropolis, a wave of elegant conversation washing over the clientele within.

Another piece of the past and present: Sofia's Banya Bashi Mosque is a doughty remnant of Ottoman times

Moskovska 15, meanwhile, is one of the city's undoubted culinary kingpins – a softly lit restaurant of crisp linen, gourmet flair and wine-list expertise. The menu entices with its talk of beef with herb-and-potato purée, and meatballs with pancetta.

I choose the former, pairing it with a half-bottle of Bulgarian merlot that is warm and rich – and wonder again why more people do not flit east to sample what is one of Europe's intriguing last secrets. For all the grand visibility of its past, Sofia is a place that is increasingly facing forwards.

British Airways (0844 493 0787; www.ba.com) flies to Sofia daily from London Heathrow. Return fares from £136.

A three-night break at the five-star Grand Hotel Sofia costs from £495 per person (based on two people sharing), including flights from Heathrow, private transfers and breakfast – through Cox & Kings (020 7873 5000; www.coxandkings.co.uk).
