To the rest of the world he is an international pariah who rules over a starving population while threatening to blow up neighbouring countries.

But if these pictures are to be believed, Kim Jong-Un's status in North Korea is closer to Harry Styles than a reviled dictator.

These images released by North Korea's Central News Agency show mushroom farm workers weeping as they struggle to get close to their leader.

Mobbed by fans: Harry Styles had to climb out of a crowd to escape his desperate fans

Dressed in all white jumpsuits, the women cling to the arms of Kim as he is marshalled through the assembled crown by a woman soldier.

The propaganda picture resembles the sort of hysterical mob reaction normally reserved by the likes of boy band One Direction.

The news agency would not reveal when or where the pictures were taken but they were released today - the same day a North Korean-flagged ship has been detained in Panama.

Authorities in the Central American country say they discovered 'sophisticated missile equipment' hidden in brown sugar containers as the ship headed to the Panama Canal.

The images show Kim Jong-Un touring a mushroom factory affiliated with North Korea's military unit 534.

Speech: The North Korean leader is surrounded by Communist party officials

Military officials are shown listening attentively to their leader as they jot down his words on notebooks.

Elsewhere, Kim Jong-Un is shown grinning widely as he stands among shelves of mushrooms.

The North Korean news agency reported that Kim Jong-Un 'gave guidance' to workers at the farm and was given a tour to 'acquaint himself in detail' with its production.

According to reports the Communist leader said they should follow the words of former North Korea president Kim Il Sung, who wanted to turn the country into a world famous mushroom producer.
