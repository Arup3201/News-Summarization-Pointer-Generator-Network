Karl Warburton, 38, was given a 12-month jail sentenced suspended for two years and banned from driving for 18 months after speeding down a dual carriageway at 130mph

A father-to-be lead police on a 130mph chase on his motorbike before giving officers the slip.

Karl Warburton, 38, was spotted by an officer in an unmarked car speeding down the A56 near Ramsbottom, Lancs., on June 30 last year.

When the officer turned on his blue lights, instead of stopping, Warburton took off at 130mph, weaving in and out of traffic and even driving down the central reservation in an attempt to escape.

Eventually he lost the police by driving the wrong way up a slip road, but was later tracked down using his licence plate and brought to court where he pleaded guilty to dangerous driving.

Sentencing him to 12 months in jail, suspended for two years, at Burnley Crown Court, Judge Beverley Lunt said it was incredible Warburton had not caused a serious accident.

She said: 'You were not just putting yourself at risk, you were putting others at risk. That is unforgivable.'

The court heard that the builder, who runs his own business, had got ‘lost in the moment’ then panicked when he spotted the police. He has since sold his motorbike.

Judge Lunt also disqualified Warburton, from Whitefield, Greater Manchester, from driving for 18 months and ordered him to pay £250 costs.

She said: 'You are a 38-year-old, allegedly, grown man. A responsible grown man with responsibilities, a family and a business you started up yourself.

Warburton was caught speeding along the A56. He drove along a section the central reservation without barriers to overtake cars in the outside lane before driving the wrong way up a slip road. Officers lost him, but later tracked him down using his licence plate

'Your speeds were terrifying, your undertaking and overtaking was terrifying. The people in the other cars must have absolutely shocked.'

After the case one traffic officer said: 'His behaviour was absolutely outrageous. You are surrendering your vehicle to the laws of physics. It was dangerous beyond words.'
