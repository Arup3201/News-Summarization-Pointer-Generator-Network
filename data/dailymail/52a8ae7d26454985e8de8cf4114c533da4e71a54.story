Four thousand people are getting a job every day – the largest increase since records began,  official figures revealed yesterday.

The data saw the pound hit an 18-month high against the euro as investors speculated that the Bank of England will be forced to raise interest rates before the end of the year.

It was thought the Bank would not act until after the General Election in May, but increasing numbers of analysts now believe the first hike since 2007 could come possibly as early as November.

The number of people in work has reached a new record high of 30.5million, after a rise which was the highest since records began in 1971. Four thousand people are now getting a job every day, according to the figures

Flipside: But figures also show a dramatic slowdown in pay growth, prolonging the squeeze on family finances

Between February and April, the Office for National Statistics said a record-breaking 345,000 people started work, raising Britain’s total workforce to a new high of 30.5million.

Since the Coalition came to power in May 2010, more than two million private sector jobs have been created. Meanwhile, the public sector workforce has shrunk by nearly 400,000.

This excludes the distorting impact of ‘reclassifications’, such as staff at Lloyds Banking Group, which was rescued by the State, being switched from the public to the private sector.

Last night Samuel Tombs, of Capital Economics, described the rise in employment as ‘colossal’. David Cameron said it meant more people had ‘the security of a pay packet and a brighter future’.

Esther McVey, the employment minister, said: ‘Businesses up and down the country are feeling increasingly confident about creating jobs.’ Three years ago, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said it was ‘a complete fantasy’ that the private sector could replace jobs lost in the public sector.

Of those aged between 16 and 64, the ONS said 72.9 per cent are working, which is within touching distance of the all-time high of 73.1 per cent.

Neil Carberry, of the CBI, said: ‘This is an unprecedented rise in the number of people in work. Unemployment continues to fall, down 347,000 over the last year to 2.17million people, the largest annual drop in the number of people looking for work for six years.’

The unemployment rate is now 6.6 per cent.

Employment minister Esther McVey said young Brits were the best in the world and urged critics to stop talking down their prospects

The figures come a day after manufacturing growth jumped to a new three-year high in April after a 4.4 per cent surge in output on the same period in 2013.

The performance was the strongest year-on-year showing since February 2011, adding to hopes that overall GDP accelerated in the second quarter.

The ONS figures showed an improvement in output of 0.4 per cent compared with a month earlier.

Yesterday’s statistics revealed that although the country’s workforce is bigger than ever, the pay squeeze remains in place.

John Philpott, of The Jobs Economist website, said: ‘Britain’s jobs market is booming everywhere apart from in most people’s pay packets.’

The average pay rise is just 0.7 per cent, far below inflation of 1.8 per cent, which means people’s bills are rising much faster than their pay is going up.

It is a squeeze which has lasted for six years, meaning many workers complain their family finances are close to breaking point or that their lifestyle has changed for the worse.

Martin Beck, of the Ernst & Young Item Club, said: ‘The stark contrast between a robust jobs market, but meagre wages growth continues. For the recovery to truly hit home, pay packets need to start growing again.’

The ONS said the figure was distorted by a big jump in pay rises in April last year as a result of the tax change, which cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p on earnings over £150,000.

As a result, the annual bonus bonanza enjoyed by bankers and other workers was delayed.

The figures also cast doubt on claims that only part-time jobs have been created since the financial crisis began as Britain stages its economic recovery. Between February and April, full-time jobs were created more than three times faster than part-time jobs.
