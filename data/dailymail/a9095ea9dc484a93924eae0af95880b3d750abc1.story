A husband faces life in jail today after he admitted decapitating his wife at home.

Naveed Ahmed, 41, initially denied the murder of mother-of-two Tahira Ahmed, 38, at their home in Northolt, west London, on May 27 last year.

The couple had two children, who were not believed to be in the house on the day their mother was beheaded. 

In October last year, Ahmed pleaded not guilty to the charge when he appeared before the Old Bailey via video link from prison.

Change of plea: Naveed Ahmed, 41, left, initially denied the murder of his wife Tahira Ahmed, 38, right, before a last minute plea change today

But at a brief hearing before judge Christopher Moss QC today, attended by his wife's family, he pleaded to guilty to murder.

The facts of the case were not opened and the judge adjourned sentencing to Wednesday, January 28 at the Old Bailey.

Death: Police found Mrs Ahmed's body with injuries to the head and neck and her husband was found nearby sweating profusely and with blood on his clothes  

His lawyer Mark Kelly QC told the court that the issue at the previous hearing had been determining Ahmed's state of mind at the time of the killing.

At the time the couple's neighbours spoke of a 'lovely couple' who 'always looked very happy together'.

But around the time of the murder a row was apparently heard at the house and Mr Ahmed was seen taking his children away from the property and returning alone.

One neighbour said: 'He was standing outside trying to get back into the house.

'They have an electronic code system to get in and I thought she may have changed it because he was outside for a while.

'The next thing we know we looked out of the window, maybe an hour or two later, and there were police cars everywhere.'

Officers found the mother-of-two's body in the house and her husband was arrested in an alleyway nearby,  

Today Ahmed, dressed in a dark blue suit and black tie, spoke only to confirm his name and enter the guilty plea in the courtroom attended by members of Mrs Ahmed's family.

The judge warned him that he would face a life sentence for the killing and he would decide on the minimum term at the hearing next week.

Ahmed was remanded in custody.
