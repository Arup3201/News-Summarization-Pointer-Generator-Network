Southampton and Crystal Palace are keen on signing Charlie Austin from QPR in the summer.

The 25-year-old, who has been among spectators enjoying the Cheltenham festival, has scored 15 goals in 25 Premier League appearances this season and QPR are keen to keep him with a new £50,000 a week contract offer in the pipeline.

However, should they be relegated Austin is almost certain to leave and other Premier League sides are keen to tempt him away from Loftus Road.

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has prioritised bringing in a new striker to support Graziano Pelle and has put Austin on his shortlist of targets along with Javier Hernandez of Manchester United and Alberto Bueno from Rayo Vallecano.

Despite the interest, QPR will hold talks with the player at the end of the season and director of football Les Ferdinand said: 'We will be trying our best come the end of the season to make sure Charlie signs up and stays.

'What we do understand is that players are ambitious. Sometimes they want to look elsewhere.

'We will be doing our best to make sure we give him the opportunity to stay and play in the Premier League.

'The aim is to replenish the squad and we don't want to be losing our best players like Charlie.'
