Disgraced former Co-op Bank boss Paul Flowers has spoken for the first time of his involvement in a drugs and sex scandal, admitting: ‘I have sinned’.

The methodist minister said he had ‘frailties’ like ‘every human being’.

He now goes to weekly therapy sessions after the ‘hellish’ period in November when footage of the openly gay banker allegedly buying hard drugs  became public.

'Deep-seated issues': Former Co-Op bank chief Paul Flowers has told the BBC's Newsnight how he checked into rehab for a month to deal with his drug addiction, and lost many friends in the process

'Hellish': Paul Flowers admitted to the BBC's Jeremy Paxman that he had 'deep-seated' issues to deal with

It came after the 63-year-old quit his
 £132,000-a-year job as chairman of the troubled bank in June last year 
shortly after a £1.5billion black hole emerged in its finances.

In an extraordinary interview aired on BBC Newsnight last night, he said ‘things got pretty hairy’ at the end of last year.

‘I am in company with every other human being for having my frailties and some of my fragility exposed,’ he added.

‘Most
 people get through life without having that being made public but of 
course I have sinned, if you want to put it in that old fashioned way.’

He
 added: ‘I think I’m much more secure in my own skin, much more 
self-aware than I was before. You certainly find out who your friends 
are even if some in the bank and in politics and the church have been 
noticeable by their absence.’

The scandal erupted as the Co-op Bank battled for survival after years of mis-management under Flowers and other senior bosses.

A
 rescue package was agreed in December that involved the self-proclaimed
 ‘ethical’ group ceding control to institutional investors, including US
 hedge funds.

Chief: Methodist minister Mr Flowers pictured giving evidence to the Treasury Committee in November

Exposed: Mr Flowers was caught on camera apparently discussing cocaine, ketamine and crystal meth

But last 
night Flowers heaped blame on the Government – singling out the 
Chancellor – for exerting ‘considerable pressure’ to push through the 
Co-op’s doomed bid to buy 631 branches from Lloyds.

The bank was forced to pull out of the deal in April last year because of its parlous finances.

Flowers
 said ‘there was pressure certainly from [former Treasury minister] Mark
 Hoban, but I believe and know that that originated much higher up with 
the Chancellor himself.’

He 
said he had received calls ‘two or three times a week’ from Mr Hoban to 
check how the deal was going. However, his comments contradict those 
made at the Treasury Select Committee on November 6, shortly before the 
drugs scandal came to light.

Asked if the discussions over the deal 
amounted to political pressure, he said: ‘No, I do not believe they 
did’. Last night the Treasury rejected  Flowers’ claims and said the 
deal was a ‘purely commercial matter for Lloyds Bank and the Co-op 
Bank’.

The police 
investigation involves allegations that Flowers used his Co-op and 
Bradford Council email accounts to organise drug-fuelled orgies with 
rent boys after a series of embarrassing messages and texts were 
published.

In one message, 
he allegedly boasted to a drugs dealer of having two bottles of the date
 rape drug GHB.

He is also alleged to have used crystal meth, crack 
cocaine and the horse tranquilliser ketamine – or brought them along to 
orgies.

The behaviour appears to have continued after the scandal broke,
 with Flowers saying in a text in November: ‘Off f****** trollies on 
coke and ketamine which I was given by this cute dealer in Manchester!! 
It is the best I have ever had.’

Media attention: Paul Flowers arrives at Stainbeck police station in Leeds in January to answer bail over alleged drugs supply offences. Police bailed him again pending further inquiries

Losses: The bank's 2013 results will be announced tomorrow and are expected to be the worst ever

Flowers has previously claimed his behaviour was influenced by the death of his mother Muriel  in 2012.

But
 it is not the first time he has been caught ‘sinning’. It emerged that 
the real reason he resigned from Bradford Council in 2011 was because 
‘inappropriate but not illegal’ pornography was found on his laptop. He 
was also once convicted for gross indecency in a public toilet in 1981.

A
 separate Treasury-led investigation is also investigating how Flowers 
was appointed to run a bank, despite only working as a bank clerk for 
several years after leaving university. He told the committee the 
Co-op’s balance sheets had £3billion of assets, when it was actually 
£47billion.

The scandal has
 also been acutely embarrassing for Labour, which has close ties with 
the mutual. As part of a major overhaul, the Co-op is now considering 
plans to scrap its £1million annual donation to the party.

The
 mutual is set to announce next month it made a record loss of more than
 £2billion last year, driven by bank losses of between £1.2billion and 
£1.3billion.

It is now the subject of no less than seven investigations, including the police probe into Flowers, who is on bail.

A
 Treasury spokesman said last night: ‘Since the full extent of the 
situation at Co-op Bank became clear the Chancellor has ordered an 
independent investigation into the events at the Co-op Bank and the 
circumstances surrounding them.’

Pressure: Mr Flowers claimed he was called two or three times a week by a junior Treasury minister and urged to allow the Co-Op to buy 600 branches of Lloyds. He claimed the orders came from George Osborne (pictured)

Resigned: Chief executive Euan Sutherland quit the bank earlier this month after details of his planned £3.6million pay package - even as the bank contemplates selling off several assets - were leaked to the press
