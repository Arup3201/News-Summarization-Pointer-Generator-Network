As the Queen took her seat at Ascot she would have been hoping for a Royal win as her then unbeaten horse Estimate took to the course.

And a Royal win was what Her Majesty got, though not the one she may have expected or wished for, as another horse called Royal Diamond took first place.

Estimate, who had three race wins under his belt at Ascot, was left trailing in a lowly seventh after coming under pressure with half a mile to go.

Her Majesty was left delighted in June when Estimate claimed victory in Royal Ascot's Gold Cup race becoming the first horse owned by a reigning monarch to win the in the race's 207-year history.

The television images of the Queen banging on the arms of her seat in the Royal Box with all the  enthusiasm of a young girl as Estimate, bore down on the  winning post made it a  Ladies’ Day to remember.

Estimate, ridden by Ryan Moore, was favourite going into the race with the soft conditions expected to help her to victory.

The Queen was joined by The Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Beatrice for the day of racing and, despite her lack of success on the track, she appeared to enjoy herself immensely.

She wrapped up warm in a pale checked tweed coat and matching pink hat, white gloves and black shoes.

Princess Beatrice, 25, wore an eyec atching grey pillbox hat to go with her warm grey coat and patent heels.

The Duke appeared in high spirits and was spotted mingling with other guests and event organisers in the jockeys' enclosure.

Among the other racegoers were television presenters Ant and Dec as well as chat show host Jeremy Kyle and his wife Carla.
