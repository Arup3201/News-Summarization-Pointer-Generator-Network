On-loan Liverpool midfielder Luis Alberto did not wait around when Malaga boss Javi Garcia called him from the bench to bring him on as a substitute against Elche.

With his side level at 1-1 in the 73rd minute at Elche's Estadio Manuel Martinez Valero, Alberto came on to replace central midfield team-mate Sergi Darder.

Just seconds later a ball from the right found the Malaga man in the middle of the park and he was on his way.

Taking on two defenders as he slalomed his way through the Elche defence, the 22-year-old found himself on the edge of the Elche box.

With the keeper closing down the angle, the former Sevilla man drilled the ball sweetly across goal  to find the back of the net and put his team ahead.

It was Alberto's second goal of the season for his temporary club, who sit seventh in La Liga.

With his parent club struggling to find a goalscorer they can rely on, the youngster certainly proved he has got the minerals.
