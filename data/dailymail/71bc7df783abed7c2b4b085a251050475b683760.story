Injured: Natalie Eaton, 18, was impaled with a golf club on her second day of college, while attending a fraternity rush party at Arkansas State University

An 18-year-old was just two days into college when she was sent to the hospital in critical condition after getting impaled with a golf club at a fraternity party.

Natalie Eaton of Harrisburg, Arkansas awoke on Thursday and was able to move most of her body, but she still doesn't remember the accident that sent her to St Bernard's Hospital in Memphis.

According to authorities, Eaton was attending a rush party at Arkansas State University's Kappa Alpha fraternity, having a cookout and playing games around 6pm Tuesday evening. 

That's when a 19-year-old man threw a football at a 20-year-old man, and the 20-year-old hit it baseball-style with a golf club.

But when the club made contact with the football, the shaft snapped and hurled at Eaton, impaling her in the neck.

Doctors say the club hit a major artery and her spinal cord and initially told friends and family she may be paralyzed.

But the immediate response of the man who caused the accident may have reduced that threat.

'His quick reactions probably saved her life,' Eaton's best friend Makaleigh Riddle told KAIT. 

The unnamed student held Eaton's head up for 15 minutes, applying pressure to the wound, until an ambulance showed up.

Eaton was then taken to St Bernard's in critical condition.

Scene: The incident happened around 6pm Tuesday evening at the Kappa Alpha house on campus.  The 20-year-old who accidentally impaled Eaton also helped keep her stable until ambulances arrived 

It wasn't until Thursday afternoon that she finally woke up, and appeared to have recovered much more than expected.

'Where the club went in, it hit her spinal cord,' Riddle said. 'The way doctors talked about it, it was probably paralysis. That's the best that we were looking at. It was really hard to hear. But now she's moving her arms and legs a day later.'

Rick Stripling, ASU's vice chancellor of student affairs, says he doesn't expect charges to be filed in the case since it was an accident.

The fraternity has since reached out to Eaton and her family on Twitter, in apology and the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority held a prayer vigil for the new student.

The incident happened just one day after classes started for Fall 2014.

Getting better: Eaton woke up on Thursday and was responsive and able to move, but didn't remember the accident that sent her to the hospital
