A jet pilot has been killed after his aircraft collided with another aircraft during a training exercise.

Video footage shot by people on the ground at different locations shows how the aircraft spirals out of control after the crash in Gangshan District in south Taiwan's Kaohsiung city.

A Lieutenant Colonel piloting the jet ejected from the aircraft after realising he had lost control of the plane, but was killed upon impact with the ground.

The incident was captured on camera by passing motorists who thought they were recording three jets in routine flight formation during training. 

However, they soon realised there was a more serious problem when one of the planes, an AIDC AT-3 aircraft, was struck with engine failure after colliding with one of the other jets and begins spinning uncontrollably towards the earth.

Netizen Piero Chen uploaded one angle of the footage on popular video sharing website YouTube, while another angle was recorded by a motorist and his wife, both of whom could not hide their shock at the impending crash.

Taiwanese media reported that 37-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Chang Bei-yuan, who was piloting the damaged aircraft, ejected from the jet but did not have sufficient time to deploy his parachute before dying from the impact.

All three AIDC AT-3 jets belong to the Republic of China Air Force Academy in Kaohsiung and were undergoing flight training when the incident happened.

Authorities will investigate the details of the accident.

Chang is survived by his wife and 10-year-old son.
