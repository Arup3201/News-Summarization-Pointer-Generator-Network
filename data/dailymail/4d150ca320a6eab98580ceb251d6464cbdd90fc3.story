A new study claims to define what exactly is classed as sexually deviant 

Do you ever worry if what floats your boat sexually might be a little unusual? Or even downright bizarre? 

If so, a new study claims to set everything straight - and define the demure from the deviant. 

Its conclusion? Men hoping for sex with two women is 'normal' - for women, the general theme is more 50 Shades of Grey.

These were just two of the findings of a research project that claims to scientifically define sexual deviation for the first time ever. 

Conducted in Montreal, Canada, the research was published today in the Journal of Sexual Medicine.

The idea behind the research was that while 'deviant sexual fantasises' often conjure up images of being very unusual, 

In a press statement, the authors said: 'Many theories about deviant sexual fantasies incorporate the concept of atypical fantasies, or paraphilias.' 

Paraphilia is defined as the the experience of intense sexual arousal to atypical objects, situations, or individuals. 

However the authors argue that 'scientific literature does not describe what these types of fantasies actually are'.

In the U.S., the psychiatric bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), mentions, 'anomalous' fantasies.

Even the World Health Organisation talks about 'unusual' fantasies in defining paraphilias. 

But, the Canadian study authors questioned, what is an unusual sexual fantasy exactly?

Christian Joyal, lead author of the study, said: 'Clinically, we know what pathological sexual fantasies are.

'They involve non-consenting partners, they induce pain, or they are absolutely necessary in deriving satisfaction. 

* The nature of sexual fantasies varies among the general population - meaning few can be considered statistically rare, unusual, or typical.

* Men have more fantasies and describe them more vividly than women

* Between 30 and 60 per cent of women - think of themes associated with submission (e.g. being tied up).

* Unlike men, 'women in general clearly distinguish between fantasy and desire'

* The majority of men would love their fantasies to come true

* Women tend to fantasise about their partner, while men generally fantasise more about extramarital relationships

*Men are more likely to think about watching their partner being with someone else or being with someone of the same sex themselves

'But apart from that, what exactly are abnormal or atypical fantasies?' 

'Our main objective was to specify norms in sexual fantasies, an essential step in defining pathologies,' he explained. 

'And as we suspected, there are a lot more common fantasies than atypical fantasies.'

To find out, they asked members of the general population - 'as simple as that,' said Professor Joyal. 

Because most studies of this nature are conducted with university students, the researchers wanted to find adults willing to describe their sexual fantasies. 

For the study, just over 1,500 adults in Quebec (a 50/50 split of men and women) completed a questionnaire describing their sexual fantasies.

They were also asked to describe their favourite fantasy in detail.

'The results were more than interesting,' said Professor Joyal. '

What surprised the researchers was that the nature of sexual fantasies varies among the general population - meaning few can be considered statistically rare, unusual, or typical.

'But not surprisingly, the study confirms that men have more fantasies and describe them more vividly than women,' he added.

The study also found that a significant proportion of women - between 30 and 60 per cent - think of themes associated with submission (e.g. being tied up).

Researchers men hoping for sex with two women is 'normal' - and they were more likely to think about to think about extramarital affairs than their female partner 

'Importantly, unlike men, women in general clearly distinguish between fantasy and desire,' Professor Joyal said.

'Therefore, many women who express more extreme fantasies of submission (e.g. domination by a stranger) specify that they never want these fantasies to come true. 

'The majority of men, however, would love their fantasies to come true', e.g. sex with more than one other person.  

And while women tend to fantasise about their partner, men generally fantasise more about extramarital relationships compared to women. 

Swingers on the hunt for excitement are spreading sexually transmitted infections by taking part in drug-fuelled orgies, research claimed earlier this month.

A Dutch study found almost half of older swingers admitted taking illegal substances to boost their prowess in the bedroom and keep multiple partners satisfied.

As well as erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra, they are also using cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), GHB, laughing gas, cannabis, poppers, speed, LSD and lysergic acid to help them perform - at levels similar to gay men. 

However, their unsafe sexual practices are putting them at increasing risk of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B, experts warn.

The researchers, writing in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, say swingers should be targeted with the same health advice as other at-risk groups. 

The study also noted: 'One of the most intriguing findings has to do with the significant number of unique male fantasies.'

By this, it was referring to watching their partner being with someone else, for example, or being with someone of the same sex.  

'Evolutionary biological theories cannot explain these fantasies, which, among males, are typically desires,' said Professor Joyal. 

'Overall, these findings allow us to shed light on certain social phenomena, such as the popularity of the book 'Fifty Shades of Grey' with women.'

He and his colleagues are now looking at whether people who like one thing - say, have submission fantasies - also like play the opposite role. 

'These two themes are therefore not exclusive, quite the contrary - they also seem associated with a higher level of satisfaction,' he explained.  

The study was undertaken by researchers at Institut universitaire en santé mentale de Montréal and Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montréal, affiliated with University of Montreal.
