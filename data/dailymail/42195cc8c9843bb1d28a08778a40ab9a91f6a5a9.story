Mario Balotelli has submitted examples of the discrimination he has suffered as he seeks to avoid an FA charge over an allegedly anti-Semitic and racist message he posted on Instagram.

The Liverpool striker has until 6pm on Friday to provide his observations to The FA over a picture that depicted the computer game character Super Mario which read: ‘Don’t be racist – be like Mario. He’s an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican.

But below the image, the words continue: ‘jumps like a black man and grabs coin like a Jew.’

Responding to criticism, Balotelli tweeted: ‘My Mom is Jewish so all of you shut up please.’

He subsequently apologised on Twitter on Tuesday morning, insisting the image was meant to be ‘anti-racist with humour’.

He also described reposting the image as ‘my unlucky moment’.

Charity group Show Racism the Red Card were encouraged by Balotelli's immediate apology on social media

But he wrote: ‘I apologise if I’ve offended anyone. The post was meant to be anti-racist with humour. I now understand that out of context it may have the opposite effect.

‘Not all Mexicans have a moustache, not all black people jump high and not all Jewish people love money.

‘I used a cartoon done by somebody else because it has Super Mario and I thought it was funny and not offensive. Again, I’m sorry.’

Balotelli will give his full co-operation to the FA during the course of any investigation and, in mitigation, will provide evidence of how he has been abused on social media during his career. 

The Liverpool striker also insisted that he meant no offence by tweeting that his mother is Jewish
