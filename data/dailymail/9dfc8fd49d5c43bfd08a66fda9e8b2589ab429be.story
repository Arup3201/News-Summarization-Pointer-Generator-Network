Cradled by a policeman and covered by his high-visibility jacket for warmth, blind pensioner Dorothy Andrew lies stricken on a pavement after tripping up.

The 75-year-old broke several teeth in the accident and was barely able to move because of the shock.

But passers-by who dialled 999 were appalled when paramedics told them they had no ambulances available to send to the scene.

Accident: A police officer sits next to blind pensioner Dorothy Andrews, 75, who had to lie on the pavement for 90 minutes after her fall

In the end, Mrs Andrew was forced to wait almost two hours in the cold before police decided to take her to hospital themselves.

Last night an MP called for an investigation into the ‘unacceptable’ ambulance service response.

Mrs
Andrew said: ‘It was quite distressing, all the time I was  getting 
colder. Apart from the shock, it does knock your confidence. I haven’t 
really been out on my own since.’ 

The
pensioner, who walks with a white stick, fell over in her home town of 
Southport in Merseyside.

Bad service: After waiting for more than 90 minutes and no ambulance appearing despite several calls for aid, police drove Ms Andrews to a hospital

She added: ‘I was a bit of a mess really. I 
fell at about 12.20pm, two people came to help me and the police stopped
too.

‘An hour and a half 
later, we were still waiting for an ambulance. The police were concerned
that I was very cold so they took the decision to try and get me in the
police car and take me to hospital themselves, which they did.

Ambulance trusts across England continue to fail to hit national targets on response times, latest figures show.

Data
from NHS England reveals that the proportion of the most serious 
Category A (Red 1) calls resulting in an emergency vehicle arriving at 
the scene within eight minutes was 74.6 per cent nationally in October.

This falls short of the 75 per cent target and compares to an average of 74.7 per cent from October 2012 to September 2013.

Some
trusts performed particularly poorly, with the lowest level of response
meaning just 68.4per cent of calls had an emergency vehicle at the 
scene within eight minutes.

Four trusts out of 11 - North West, East Midlands, East of England and South Western - failed to hit the target.

Red
1 calls are the most time-critical. They cover severe conditions such 
as heart attack patients who are not breathing and do not have a pulse.

The
national average time it takes for an ambulance to reach a patient has 
increased by 30 seconds since 2011, with some regions worse hit than 
others, those figure showed.In
the East of England waiting times have increased by a minute and a 
half, more than 40per cent, while patients in the West Midlands are 
waiting an extra 32 seconds.

NHS
England has allocated an extra £14 million to NHS groups commissioning 
ambulance services so they can secure extra staff and equipment to cover
the winter months.

‘They
kept phoning the ambulance control, who said there were no ambulances 
available.’

Five days after Mrs Andrew’s fall, 85-year-old dementia 
sufferer Enid Horsley suffered a similar ordeal when she was forced to 
wait two hours on the floor of her home in Southport, after falling and 
breaking her pelvis.

Her 
great-nephew Ian Stevenson, 42, describe the situation as a ‘disgrace’.

It is a bit of a sorry state of affairs for the ambulance service over 
those few days, between my aunt falling and the other elderly lady left 
on the pavement,’ he said.

‘We got told that they have to prioritise, 
but I just don’t think they have enough ambulances covering the area.

‘To have to wait two hours for medical care for an elderly person, or any age, it is just disgraceful.’

Local
Liberal Democrat MP John Pugh said he would be demanding answers from 
the ambulance service, adding: ‘They must stand accountable because it 
[the waiting time] is way beyond the target set for them.

'It is 
unacceptable.’

A spokesman 
for the North West Ambulance service apologised for the delays.

She 
said: ‘Although the service strives to attend to every patient as 
quickly as possible, those with serious, life-threatening conditions 
require a more urgent response.’

Ambulance
trusts across England continue to fail to hit national targets on 
response times, latest figures show.

Data from NHS England reveals the 
proportion of the most serious calls resulting in an emergency vehicle 
arriving at the scene within eight minutes was 74.6 per cent nationally 
in October – short of the 75 per cent target.
