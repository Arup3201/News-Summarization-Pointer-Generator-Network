Declined to comment: Mr Lavery is MP for Wansbeck in Northumberland

The son of an MP has been forced to apologise after describing Katie Price's disabled son as a 'vegetable'.

Ian Lavery Jnr, 24, cracked a sick joke on Twitter about ten-year-old Harvey and made a crude reference to his mother.

His father, Ian Lavery, who is patron
 of the brain injury charity Headway, said he was 'appalled' by his 
son's behaviour, but last night said he had 'no intention of policing' his children.

Last night, Price, 34, blasted the pair and claimed the joke should be treated as a hate crime like racism.

The
 model told The Sun: 'This makes me sick to my stomach. Not just that 
someone could be so vile as to say such a thing, but also could think it
 clever to repeat to the world on Twitter.

'What kind of father, what kind of MP, is Ian Lavery?

'These
 disgusting comments aimed at Harvey all too often get aimed at other 
disabled children and the poor souls his father's charity rightly 
campaigns for.'

Harvey was born with septo-optic 
dysplasia, which causes blindness and growth hormone deficiency and also
 suffers from Prader-Willi syndrome, which can lead to obesity and 
diabetes.

Ian Lavery Jnr, 
from Newcastle, reacted angrily with a string of expletives when he was 
first challenged on Twitter about his comments.

But today he told MailOnline: 'I unreservedly apologise for any offence
 that I have caused Katie Price and her family.

'I am ashamed that my 
actions have caused such distress, to my father, especially given how 
strongly he campaigns for disabled rights.'

Mr Lavery, an MP for Wansbeck, 
initially said he had no intention of policing his children, adding: 
'They have to learn how to behave in the big wide world like I did.'

However, he told MailOnline today that he'd had a 'full and frank conversation with him and he is in no doubt about my views.'

He
 added: 'Since long before my election to parliament, I have been a 
constant and committed advocate on behalf of disabled and vulnerable 
groups in Wansbeck and across the North East.

'Consequently,
 I was shocked, appalled and hugely disappointed when a post from my  
eldest son on twitter was brought to my attention.

'He is an adult and has to behave and act responsibly. I have had a full and frank conversation with him and he is in no doubt about my views.

'My son is full of remorse for his insensitive and thoughtless comments.'

Harvey has found himself under attack before.

Comedian Frankie Boyle was cautioned by Ofcom in 2010 after he made a vile sexual slur about him on a Channel 4 show.

In November 2007, Heat magazine gave away a sticker bearing a picture of Harvey next to the words 'Harvey wants to eat me'.

The then editor Mark Frith apologised and said 'no offence was intended.'
