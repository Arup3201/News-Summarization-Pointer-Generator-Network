Four men have been charged with various offences after Monday's English Defence League march on Downing Street.

About 1,000 protesters chanted 'Muslim killers off our streets' and 'There's only one Lee Rigby' in tribute to the soldier killed in Woolwich, south-east London, last week.

A massive police presence kept them apart from a smaller group of anti-fascist activists, with officers making 13 arrests in total.

Nicholas McGee, 20, of Misbourne Road, Uxbridge in west London was also arrested in Leicester Square and charged with possession of class A drugs.

Anthony Drury, 48, of no fixed abode, was arrested in Whitehall and charged with possession of a bladed article.

Of the nine other people arrested, four were bailed pending further investigation and five were released without charge.
