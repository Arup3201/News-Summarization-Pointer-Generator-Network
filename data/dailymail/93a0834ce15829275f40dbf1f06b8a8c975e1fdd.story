Savage attack: Cedric Brown is accused of attacking Mark Williams in his home so violently that paramedics could not tell what colour the victim's skin was because he was covered in blood

An armed robber attacked a man so savagely that paramedics could not see what colour his skin was because he was covered with blood, a  court has been told.

Cedric Brown, 46, is accused of attacking wealthy stable owner Mark Williams, 51, with a knife in a terrifying burglary at his £600,000 farmhouse in Siston Common, near Bristol as Mr Williams tried to protect his wife Susan.

Birmingham Crown Court heard how Brown and an accomplice allegedly slashed Mr Williams in the throat and stabbed him three times in the stomach before beating the family’s dogs so badly with walking sticks that they had to be put down.

Mr Williams confronted the men during the raid on November 16, 2010 as one of the men held a knife to his 51-year-old wife's throat after she went to investigate a noise downstairs, the court heard.

In giving evidence, Mr Williams described to the jury how he came face-to-face with the robbers in his home while the other restrained his wife.

Mr Williams, who still bears visible scars from the attack on his neck, said: ‘I had been stabbed in the left side, 
had a slash in my neck and slashes down either side of my face from 
scalp to ear and there was a slash down my left eye.

‘I had squirted blood all over the ceiling from the cuts in my face and the floor was soaked, it was very wet.

Anthony Potter, prosecuting, told the jury of seven women and five men that a hat covered in Brown's DNA was found at the scene of the crime.

He said: ‘This wasn't just a run-of-the-mill burglary. It was aggravated by the fact that Brown was armed when he committed the burglary.

‘He wasn't simply armed. He used that
 knife in a gratuitous and unnecessary attack on a householder who had 
had the temerity to try and protect his wife, who was being attacked, 
and his property.

‘They had gone to bed around 9pm when Mrs Williams heard their dogs making a lot of noise outside.

‘She went downstairs, dressed only in her pyjama top to see what was going on.

‘She saw two uninvited individuals at the bottom of the staircase, they were both black males one larger and short, the other tall and thin, it was clear to her the large one was in charge.

‘When Mr Williams heard noise of distress he also came downstairs, he didn't just find two uninvited males. He found an uninvited male who was by this point holding his wife.

‘He told them to leave, the man didn't take the invitation, he did quite the opposite. That man who we say is Cedric Brown slashed Mr Williams with the knife.

‘He slashed him in his neck and stabbed him in the stomach.

‘He was stabbed so badly that when 
paramedics arrived at the scene they said they couldn't tell what colour
 his skin was. He was literally covered in blood.’

Giving
 evidence from behind a screen, Mrs Williams, who is a hair stylist, 
told the court they were attacked after they had gone to bed to watch 
television.

She said: ‘We 
had just gone to bed and were just snuggling up to watch I'm a Celebrity
 Get Me Out Of Here when I heard the dogs barking.

‘I went downstairs to see what was going on and thought it must be my daughter coming home.

‘Then through the window into the 
kitchen I saw two men, one had a scarf wrapped round his head and the 
other was wearing a dark sort of bobble hat.

‘One of them, the shorter man, saw me, grabbed me and put the knife to my throat. I screamed get out of my house, get out.

‘He said to me, “You have a daughter, go and get her.” I said, “She's not here, she's not here”.

‘My
 husband came downstairs in his night wear and told them to get out, he 
can sound quite aggressive but he's a little kitten really.

‘I think this took them aback, the chunky one lunged at him and they began to wrestle on the floor.

Mrs Williams said her husband looked dazed and slipped in and out consciousness.

She said: ‘I could see he had been stabbed in the side and his throat had been cut, there was a cut by his eye and blood on his face.

‘The chunky man kept shouting at me to get the safe. Then he said to me, “We kill people”, he said it like he was offering me a cup of tea.

‘He started coming toward me holding 
this knife, it was between three and four inches long, bigger than one 
you'd use for potatoes.

‘I just desperately thought about what money we had, and I remembered the takings I had brought home from the salon.

‘I told him there was money there and that seemed to satisfy the taller man but the chunky one just kept coming toward me.’

Mrs
 Williams, who broke down and wept as she described fearing for her 
life, said: ‘I dropped to my knees and prayed for him not to kill us.

‘He
 spotted the cross I was holding from my necklace and grabbed it and 
yanked it off my neck, that seemed to satisfy them and they left through
 the back door.

‘They had been holding walking sticks from out utility room, and I believe they beat two of our dogs with them because we had to have them put down.

‘At one point I managed to escape and they grabbed me by my hair and yanked me back in using the hooks on the sticks.

‘I am certain that he would have killed us had I not remembered that money.’

Mr Williams told the court: ‘I went downstairs and spotted one man at the bottom of the stairs and the other holding my wife.

‘I shouted at them to leave but they didn't. He shouted back, “We're already in now”. We wrestled and the second man started hitting me with a walking stick.

‘I think by this time I had been stabbed as I was starting to lose energy. I must have been stabbed straight away.

‘I tried to get away into the next room, tried to push him back with the
 door or trap him in it - but I had lost a lot of blood and was weak so 
he overpowered me. By this time he was slashing me in the face as well.

"The chunkier man went upstairs and was desperately rummaging around. I thought we were going to die. They kept saying, "Which bedroom is the safe in" and "Where's your daughter".

Brown denies one count of burglary of a dwelling and wounding with intent.

The trial continues.
