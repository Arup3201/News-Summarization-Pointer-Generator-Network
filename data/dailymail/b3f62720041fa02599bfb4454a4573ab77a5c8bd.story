NBC announced Monday that it would scrap its miniseries about Hillary Clinton just hours after CNN Films said it was canceling a highly-anticipated documentary about the former secretary of state.

'After reviewing and prioritizing our slate of movie/mini-series development, we’ve decided that we will no longer continue developing the Hillary Clinton miniseries,' NBC said in a statement Monday afternoon.

Hours earlier, CNN canceled its Clinton film after director Charles Ferguson backed away from the project citing pressure from Clinton's staff and supporters.

'Charles Ferguson has informed us 
that he is not moving forward with his documentary about Hillary 
Clinton,' CNN Worldwide spokesperson Allison Gollust told Politico.
'Charles is an Academy Award winning director who CNN Films was excited
to be working with, but we understand and respect his decision.'

'[W]e won't seek other partners and are not proceeding with the film,' she wrote.

Ferguson provided a lengthy explanation for his decision in a column for the Huffington Post. 

He said he initially got pushback from Clinton aides Nick Merrill and Phillipe Reines, 'who contacted various people at CNN, interrogated them, and expressed concern about alleged conflicts of interest generated because my film was a for-profit endeavor.'

That didn't deter him, he explained, but 'when I approached people for interviews, I discovered that nobody, and I mean nobody, was interested in helping me make this film. Not Democrats, not Republicans - and certainly nobody who works with the Clintons, wants access to the Clintons, or dreams of a position in a Hillary Clinton administration,' Ferguson wrote.

'Not even journalists who want access, which can easily be taken away,' he added. 'I even sensed potential difficulty in licensing archival footage from CBN (Pat Robertson) and from Fox.

CNN Films is canceling a highly anticipated documentary about Hillary Clinton after director Charles Ferguson (pictured in 2011) dropped the project citing pressure from Clinton's staff and supporters.

'After approaching well over a hundred people, only two persons who had ever dealt with Mrs. Clinton would agree to an on-camera interview, and I suspected that even they would back out.'

Ferguson said he wasn't surprised by the
Republicans National Committees' recent decision to boycott CNN with 
regard to the 2016 presidential primary debates if they aired his film.

'What did surprise me,' he wrote, 
'was that, quietly and privately, prominent Democrats made it known both
to CNN and to me that they weren't delighted with the film, either.'

Ferguson also rips into Bill Clinton in his post, accusing him of being a liar.

Describing a private interview with Clinton in June, Ferguson said the former president told him 'the most amazing lies I've heard in quite a while.'

'Wow, I thought, this guy is a really good actor,' he wrote. 'And I also saw one reason why Hillary Clinton might not be thrilled about my movie.'

Ferguson called his decision to cancel the film 'a victory for the Clintons, and for the money machines that both political parties have now become.'
