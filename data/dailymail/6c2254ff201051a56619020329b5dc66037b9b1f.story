Australia eased past Scotland despite a long rain delay to finish second in World Cup Pool A after a seven-wicket win in Hobart.

Scotland were skittled out for 130 in just 25.4 overs by the Australia attack with Mitchell Starc (four for 14) the key man for the tournament co-hosts.

Australia then made light work of the reply, which was interrupted for an hour and a half by a rain delay, with Michael Clarke top-scoring with 47 as they eased to victory in 15.2 overs.

It was a dominant performance by Australia starting with their bowling attack. Starc accounted for opening batsmen Kyle Coetzer (nought) and Calum MacLeod (22) before returning to bowl out Josh Davey (26) and last man Iain Wardlaw (nought).

Matt Machan offered some brief resistance with a knock of 40 before being caught by James Faulkner off the bowling of Pat Cummins, but with wickets tumbling at regular intervals, Scotland were unable to gain any momentum.

Cummins finished with figures of three for 42 while Shane Watson, Mitchell Johnson and Glenn Maxwell also picked up a wicket apiece.

In reply, Australia lost Aaron finch for 20 in the fourth over but then started motoring nicely, with Clarke and Shane Watson bring up the 50 mark in 45 balls.

Clarke fell for 47 when the score was on 92 and shortly after the teams were forced to leave the pitch for an earlier than scheduled dinner break as heavy rain started to fall in Hobart.

After an hour and a half's delay, both sides returned to the field with no overs lost, where new batsman David Warner and James Faulkner plundered the remaining runs required for victory.

Warner hit 21 from six balls while Faulkner added 16 from six as the duo wasted no time in wrapping up the match.

The result meant Scotland finished winless at the bottom of Pool A after their six group games.
