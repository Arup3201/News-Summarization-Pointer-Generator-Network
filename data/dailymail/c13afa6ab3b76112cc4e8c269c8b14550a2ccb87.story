A drunk Ford Transit driver was racing a car in a scene witnesses likened to 'The Fast and the Furious' films when he mounted the kerb and killed a 16-year-old girl, an inquest has been told.

Grandfather Stephen Tilbury, 51 - who also died in the crash - had drunk four pints of beer in less than an hour before getting behind the wheel of his van in Dagenham, Essex on June 28 last year.

Tilbury was almost three times the drink-drive limit and had started swerving wildly while racing an unidentified silver car when he suddenly lost control and crashed into beauty student Lauren Brown.

Witness Barbara Walker told the inquest she had been driving behind Tilbury at the time of the crash.

'He was swerving and he and a silver car started overtaking each other', she said.

'It was like The Fast and the Furious,' Ms Walker added.

Investigating officer PC Alex Hewitt of the Metropolitan Police said both deaths could have been prevented if Tilbury had been driving inside the 30mph speed limit.

Miss Brown, who had been studying health and beauty at Havering College in nearby Hornchurch, was walking less than half a mile from her home in Crow Lane, Dagenham when she was knocked down at around 10pm on a Friday night last June.

Tilbury, from Romford in Essex, was driving home from nearby Crowlands Heath Golf Club when his van hit a kerb at more than 40mph.

PC Hewitt said Tilbury's Transit bounced 'like a billiard ball' across the road and crashed into the teenager as she walked on the path.

Miss Brown was rushed to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel but died around three hours later at 12.50am as a result of severe bruising to her brain.

After crashing into the student,Â Tilbury careered through a fence before plunging down an embankment.

Paramedics declared him dead at the scene.

Speaking at the inquest, Miss Brown's mother Karen Armstrong said her daughter had a 'strong, bubbly personality.'

Mrs Armstrong said she was a 'beautiful, family-orientated girl who had everything to live for'.

'Lauren was always smiling... Everybody loved her and she loved her friends,' Mrs Armstrong added.

Senior East London coroner, Nadia Persaud, recording her narrative verdict, said it was possible diabetes-sufferer Tilbury had blacked out due to low blood sugar levels but it was 'not a probability.'

Detective Sergeant Helen Lambert, the leading investigating officer, said Tilbury would have been charged with causing death by dangerous driving and driving under the influence of alcohol had he survived.

Since the crash, flowers and messages from grieving friends and family have been left at the scene.

Miss Brown's best friend, Molly Galvin-Law, 17, said 'Everyone loved Lauren. If you were feeling down, she would be there to cheer you up.

'I have spent almost every day with her for the past seven years. I don't know what I'm going to do without her... I can't believe this has happened,' she added.

Tilbury left his wife Linda as well as his two children and three grandchildren.

Tilbury's daughter Louise said after his death: 'He was a loved husband, dad, and grandad. We are absolutely devastated by his death... We are also grieving for the young girl's family.'

In a poignant message left at the scene of the crash, Tilbury's wife Linda wrote: 'So, so sorry that your life has been taken so young. A double tragedy. Hope you both get to heaven together and he can tell you what happened - cos I don't know why.'
