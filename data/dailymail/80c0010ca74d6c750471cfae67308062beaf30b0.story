Two people have died after a Tennessee police officer switched off his blue lights before racing through a set of traffic lights and smashing into their car.

Danny Floyd, 63, and his passenger, 49-year-old Michelle Sloyan, were both killed when an unidentified officer in a Bartlett Police cruiser hit them as Floyd made a turn on Sunday afternoon.

The Memphis-area police department said the officer was not responding to a call at the time but was trying to catch up to another officer, who was attempting to stop a traffic violator.

One witness said that the police officer switched off his blue lights before racing through the intersection, WMC reported, but it is not clear if he was speeding or if he went through a red light.

Authorities are also looking at who had right of way. 

Police Chief Barry Rikard said he had also received conflicting reports about whether or not the officer's siren was on, but they hope the car's dashboard will show whether they were activated.

There are no surveillance cameras at the intersection - or in the whole town of Bartlett - but police said local businesses might have caught the crash on their security cameras, WREG reported.

Floyd's nephew AC Husted told WMC that the death of his uncle, a logger and family man, had hit everyone hard.

'He's a good man, he's always smiling, he's always joking,' Husted said. 'He's always doing something for the family.'

The officer, whose name has not been released, is on sick leave with minor injuries. 

Authorities said he had been in the force for six years and had not had any problems in that time.

The police chief may turn the case over to Tennessee Highway Patrol or the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

'I don't want it to be a slap on the wrist,' Husted said. 'That doesn't bring back my uncle.'

No additional details have been given into the traffic violation the officer was reportedly heading towards.
