A pair of extreme snowboarders spent weeks travelling across frozen seas to test their skills on the untouched slopes of Antarctica. 

Thrillseeking duo Xavier de le Rue, from France, and Lucas DeBari, from the US, took on icebergs, glaciers, jaw-dropping cliffs and near vertical slopes  just a few hundred kilometers from the South Pole.

Accompanied by photographer Tero Repo and cameraman Guido Perrini, and with just a few curious cormorants for company, the intrepid duo would trudge for hours through deep powder to enjoy just a few minutes snowboarding at a time.

Xavier, a professional snowboarder from France, wanted Tero to captured the entire event through his lens.

The photographer said: 'I've been working with Xavier for years and we came up with the idea for this expedition.

'The only negative was crossing the Drake Passage, as sea sickness wasn't fun.

'But it was the trip of a lifetime - Antarctica is one of the most amazing places in the world.'

While Tero, 36, was on skis, Lucas and Xavier opted for snowboards. 

Tero, from Helsinki, Finland, revealed the group would spend a day or two at each spot making sure every picture was perfect.

He added: 'Everyone has been really stoked by the photographs and it's one of those trips that never gets old.

'I think 20 years from now people will still be talking about these photos.'
