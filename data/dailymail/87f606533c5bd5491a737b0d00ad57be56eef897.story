Manchester United youngster Will Keane is close to joining Sheffield Wednesday on loan until the end of the season.

The forward is due to complete his move to the Championship club in the next 24 hours. 

The England Under 21 international has been told he can leave Old Trafford this month in search of regular first-team football and Wednesday manager Stuart Gray looks to have won the race to land the United starlet.

Sheffield Wednesday are close to completing the signing of Will Keane on loan until the end of the season

Stockport-born Keane graduated from Manchester United's youth academy in 2011, but has found first-team opportunities hard to come by. 

He has spent time on loan at Wigan Athletic and QPR in previous seasons and has represented England from Under 16s level to Under 21s.

Keane's contract at Manchester United expires at the end of the season and the striker will need to impress while on loan at Wednesday if he is to earn a new deal.
