They have been one of the retail sensations of the Christmas season. Sales of eReaders, the handheld devices on to which electronic books can be downloaded, rocketed through December.

It is good news for makers such as Amazon, which produces the best- selling Kindle and collects 30 per cent of the price of downloaded books.

But there are fears that their profits could be hit by a the sheer number of pirate eBooks available to download for free.

Just as pirates and websites including Napster undermined the music  industry by putting music on the web for free, so the same is now happening with eBooks.

An agreement between six major 
publishers including Harper Collins and Penguin also recently saw prices rocket for many ebooks - some of 
which are more expensive than the paper version.

Creating pirate copies of published books is simple and can be done using a computer and a scanner in a relatively short period of time, or by converting the file format of a 'bought' ebook.

Freely available software which people can download to their home computers is able to convert just about any document file for reading on a Kindle or other ereader.

Hitting back: Publishers have asked Google to demote pirate websites to make sure they do not appear at the top of web searches for free eBooks

One pirate website boasts: ‘With a Kindle there is pretty much no protection against pirated books. There are programs which can simply convert any piece of text into the proper format and it will show on your Kindle as if you had bought it!’

It is estimated that up to 20 per cent of eBook downloads are from pirate sites.

The Publishers Association issued 115,000 legal threats to websites to stop them offering free pirated books in 2011, a rise of 130 per cent on 2010.

Passwords could become a thing of the past as firms such as Apple develop face-recognition software to let users access their smartphones, tablets and laptops.

The technology scans the face that is looking at the screen, picking out key features such as the distance between the eyes, the size of the nose or the shape of the lips, then comparing them to a stored image, the Apple Insider blog says.

Some PCs from firms such as Dell and even smartphones from Samsung already use the technology.

Hi-tech firms are racing to rescue users from the need to remember a growing store of passwords  to access their technology.

Apple and Google are both understood to be developing facial recognition 'passwords' - and the new version of Windows will include an option to circle people on screen in family photos as opposed to memorising huge strings of numbers and letters.

Publishers are in talks with the Government and Google to find ways to combat the trade, which breaches their copyright.

They have asked Google to demote pirate websites to ensure they do not appear at the top of web searches for consumers looking to find eBooks. Pressure is also being put on internet service providers to shut down pirate websites.

One of the best-known eBook pirate websites offers a selection of best-sellers that should not yet even be available to the public.

One example is 77 Shadow Street, the new novel by Dean Koontz. Amazon customers will have to pay £11.96 to pre-order it – but an eBook and audiobook version are already available for free from the pirate site.

The rise of the pirate eBook websites coincides with concern among consumers about the high price of legal book downloads.

Five big publishers, together with Apple, are under investigation by the European Commission for allegedly colluding to push up the price of eBooks by as much as 50 per cent.

Many eBooks are available for as little as 99p, however a bestseller can cost more than £10.

In some cases, Amazon and Apple are charging more for an eBook download than the real book.
