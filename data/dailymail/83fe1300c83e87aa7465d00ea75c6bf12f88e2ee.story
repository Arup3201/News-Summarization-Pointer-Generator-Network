The watching world were treated to a celebration of colour, dance and music as Brazil officially unleashed the 2014 World Cup.

The location? Arena de Sao Paulo, Brazil. The reason? Kick-starting the world's greatest tournament, and in some style too.

Much was debated as to whether Brazil would be up to hosting the World Cup but, judging by this opening ceremony, they seem to be off to a fairly good start.

Host commentator

Right, that's my bit done for now. I'll hand you over to Dan Ripley, who will bring you full live commentary on Brazil vs Croatia here.

And with that, J Lo and her co-performers run, smiling and waving, from the field and the opening ceremony draws to a close.

That was a short affair, but very sweet and colourful and we now have just over an over until the match between Brazil and Croatia gets underway.

And now the ball in the middle of the pitch has split into segments to reveal, oh yes, Jennifer Lopez belting out the official World Cup song 'We Are One (Ola Ola)' alongside Pitbull.

She's wearing a very revealing green sequin dress and looking very fine indeed. He's wearing white trousers that look uncomfortably high.

We've also got the delightful Claudia Leitte on stage in a blue sparkly dress.

Now, at last, the ceremony acknowledges that a football tournament is about to take place as kids in the colours of the 32 nations make their way into the middle and show off some juggling skills with a ball on an elastic string.

The colourful globe in the middle going mad now, showing the flags of all the countries and then the Brazuca, the official ball of the competition.

Now a demonstration of the traditional and very exciting Brazilian martial art of Capoeira. England's players tried their hand at it when they toured Rio de Janeiro the other day.

We've now moved on from the nature phase to celebrate the rich diversity of Brazil, with hundreds of performers in bright costumes twirling around and dancing to a classic Brazilian rhythm.

The preparations for the opening ceremony as thorough as for the tournament itself. Workshops to find and train those taking part tonight started back in March and there have been some 84 hours of rehearsals to get them fully drilled and in sync.

At the moment, the rather mesmerizing ball continues to swirl and glow in its many colours as everyone dances around. some are on trampolines and some in canoes, each aspect designed to reflect a part of Brazilian life.

The opening ceremony underway now in Sao Paulo and, at the moment, we have lots of people dressed as trees and flowers striding their way across the very colourful stage.

In the centre of it all, a swirling multi-coloured ball serves as an eye-catching centrepiece.

Each of the props used in tonight's ceremony has been designed with an even weight distribution so as not to cause any damage to the playing surface here.

If you've seen the shocking state of the pitch in Manaus, where England will play Italy on Saturday, you'll know this is very wise indeed.

A little bit of time-keeping for you - the opening ceremony is expected to get underway at 7.15pm UK time (so very shortly indeed) and will last about 25 minutes or so.

There will then be quite a lot of time for Adrian Chiles and his ITV colleagues to fill until the actual kick-off at 9pm.

Oliver Todd: While coaches speak of the value of experience at a World Cup, it is inevitably the lesser heard-of young players who provide some of every tournament’s stand-out moments.

Roy Hodgson has made the effort to inject his squad with young talent to spring a surprise on England’s opponents, but across the competition other countries are doing the same with not-so-big names looking to make an impact.

So looking ahead, here’s 10 players you might not have heard of who can light up the World Cup.

From referees squirting shaving foam on the pitch to mystic turtles, here's Riath Al-Samarrai with a top ten of things you will see at the World Cup for the first time this summer.

And, yes, he has included England winning a penalty shoot-out. To be fair, we are long overdue a taste of success from 12 yards.

There won't be a spare seat at the Arena de Sao Paulo this evening as the 20th World Cup finals get underway and the samba celebrations are already in full swing.

Let the endless debate and discussion cease, get your mates on the sofa, unplug the phone, get the chilled beers from the fridge, get the takeaway ordered and enjoy a full month of world class football.

The World Cup kicks off this evening, the pomp and pageantry of the opening ceremony at the Arena de Sao Paulo leading in to the first course - Brazil vs Croatia.

Stay with me here for all the best pictures and coverage of the opening ceremony and then I'll hand you over to Mr Dan Ripley for the first of 64 matches at the world's greatest sporting spectacle.
