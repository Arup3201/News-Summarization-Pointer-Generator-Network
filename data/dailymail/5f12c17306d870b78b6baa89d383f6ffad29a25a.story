Promoting her latest Peter Rabbit book, Emma Thompson said she no longer supported Labour and admitted her daughter goes to a private school

She has been a renowned supporter of left-wing politics.

But when it comes to educating her daughter, it seems Emma Thompson is prepared to put her political leanings on the back burner.

The actress has revealed she sends 14-year-old Gaia – her child with husband Greg Wise – to a north London private school instead of entrusting her education to the state.

Once Gaia turns 16, her mother hopes to enrol her at a state school near their home in West Hampstead – however even that will be one of the UK’s most elite establishments.

Miss Thompson told The Times: ‘We’re not in the catchment area for Camden School for Girls, but she might go there for the sixth form.’

The 55-year-old, who is said to be worth £30million, was educated at the school herself when it was still a grammar. 

It has long been a favourite of wealthy left-wing parents who can afford to live in its expensive catchment area, and inspectors regularly describe it as ‘outstanding’.

Other alumni include actress Tamsin Greig and the children of several Blairite cabinet ministers.

If Gaia does get in, it may improve her chances of being accepted by an elite university like her mother, who studied at Cambridge.

In recent years, ministers have encouraged admissions tutors to accept lower grades from state pupils if they show more ‘potential’ than their private school counterparts.

The actress hit out at US President Barack Obama for not 'changing things' and Tony Blair for 'accruing wealth'

Miss Thompson – who also has a 27-year-old adopted son Tindy – also used her interview to call for a ‘revolution’ to fix the world’s social and political problems.

And despite being pictured in a ‘celebrity selfie’ with Ed Miliband at a Labour drinks reception earlier this year, she said she is now so disillusioned by politics that she ‘cannot support any of it’.

She said: ‘I don’t think this is working, everybody! I’m in a red-hot phase of meltdown. We’re going to have to have a revolution.’

Thompson reserved praise for millionaire comedian Russell Brand, right, seen with his heiress former girlfriend, Jemima Khan
