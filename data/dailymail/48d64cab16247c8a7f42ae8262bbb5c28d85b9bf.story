The war of words between Rupert Murdoch and Gordon Brown continued this morning as the media mogul renewed his attack on the former prime minister's 'state of mind'.

In the opening minutes of the Leveson Inquiry, Mr Murdoch said Mr Brown ordered Lord Mandelson to make up lies about an alleged secret deal with David Cameron.

The 81-year-old said that Lord Mandelson admitted in his autobiography that he 'did this under order from Mr Brown 
knowing it to be false', adding: 'I think that reflects Mr Brown's state
of mind at the time.'

Mr Murdoch also rejected Mr Brown's claim that he 
was wrong when he said the former prime minister 'declared war' on the 
tycoon's media empire after the Sun switched support to the 
Conservatives in 2010.

Yesterday, Mr Brown issued a frank denial of the conversation, but Mr Murdoch said this morning: 'I said that very carefully yesterday, under oath, and I stand by every word of it.'

Mr Brown yesterday accused Mr Murdoch of misleading the Leveson Inquiry following his comments on the disputed 'declare war' conversation.

In extraordinary testimony at the inquiry which prompted a war of words between the two men, Mr Murdoch claimed Mr Brown phoned him in 2009 to demand to know what was going on when The Sun, his flagship newspaper, declared it was switching its backing from Labour to the Tories.

He said that during the conversation, accounts of which have circulated for months at Westminster, it was clear that Mr Brown was not in a ‘balanced state of mind’.

Battle: Gordon Brown and Rupert Murdoch were engaged in an incredible war of words last night with the former Prime Minister accused of making a 'threatening' phone call to the media mogul when The Sun dropped support for Labour in 2009

Mr Murdoch said that when The Sun declared its support for Mr Cameron in September 2009 he had told Mr Brown: ‘I’m sorry to tell you Gordon, we will support a change of government when there is an election.’

He said Mr Brown responded: ‘Well, your company has declared war on the Government. We have no alternative but to declare war on your company.’

Mr Murdoch told the inquiry: ‘I said, “I’m sorry about that Gordon, thank you for calling”, and that was that. End of subject. I don’t think he was in a very balanced state of mind... I don’t know.’

Last night Mr Brown issued a tersely worded public statement, insisting: ‘I did not phone Mr Murdoch or meet him, or write to him about his decision. The only phone call I had with Mr Murdoch in the last year of my time in office was a phone call specifically about Afghanistan and his newspaper’s coverage of the war.

‘This was in the second week of November after his newspaper, The Sun, printed a story in the second week of November about the death of a soldier and his mother’s complaints.

‘I hope Mr Murdoch will have the good grace to correct his account.’

His denial is exceptionally serious, as it alleges Mr Murdoch was not telling the truth at a judicial inquiry where witnesses swear on oath to do so.

The feud between the two men, who were once so close that their wives held a ‘slumber party’ together at Chequers, the Prime Minister’s official residence, escalated in the dying days of the Labour Government.

Mr Murdoch’s allies note that Labour figures close to Mr Brown have since led the pursuit of his empire over the phone-hacking scandal.

Giving evidence to Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into the Press yesterday, Mr Murdoch, 81, used glowing terms to describe Mr Brown’s nemesis Tony Blair, saying he was ‘impressive’ and a personal friend who was god-father to his daughter Grace.

He even revealed it was true he had joked to Mr Blair, when he was leader of the Opposition in the early 1990s: ‘If our flirtation is ever consummated, Tony, then I suspect we’ll end up making love like porcupines – very, very carefully.’

The News Corporation chairman and chief executive insisted he had never asked any politician for commercial favours, and resented the implication that his newspapers backed political parties depending on such factors.

‘If that had been the case we would have endorsed the Conservative Party in every election,’ he said.

‘But I didn’t. I was interested in issues. I want to put it to bed once and for all, that that is a complete myth... that I used the influence of The Sun or the supposed political power to get favourable treatment.’

In a moment of levity, Mr Murdoch caused laughter when describing the ‘pyjama party’ held by Mr Brown’s wife Sarah at Chequers which was attended by former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks and Mr Murdoch’s wife Wendi Deng.

‘I think there were just a bunch of women, mainly complaining about their husbands probably,’ he said.

In his testimony, Mr Murdoch also attacked Mr Brown for his ‘outrageous’ suggestion that The Sun had hacked medical records to get the story of Mr Brown’s son Fraser being diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.

The inquiry heard Mr Murdoch’s visits to Downing Street were always by the back door because prime ministers ‘don’t want me to be photographed going in the front’, adding: ‘It happens to be a shortcut to my apartment so it’s quite OK.’

Rupert Murdoch swore on a Bible to tell the truth. Minutes later, after he had assured us that he never sought commercial favours from prime ministers, there came a crash of thunder from the heavens.

It may or may not have been an expression of scepticism from the Almighty but it lent proceedings an air of Scooby Doo, which invariably featured thunder and lightning, normally when the baddie was terrifying Shaggy.

The inquiry is being held in court 73 at the Royal Courts of Justice, the same room where the Hutton Inquiry was conducted. Low ceiling. Joyless lighting. Polite but firm officials. Shades of a Dignitas clinic.

Evidence: Rupert Murdoch gestures as he gives evidence before Lord Justice leveson yesterday

Beak Leveson wears no robes or wig. En route to the court I passed a wig shop in a street behind the building. In the window: two wigged, waxwork heads, one of them a ringer for Jeremy Hunt.

Lord Justice Leveson sits on a dais before a dull blue curtain which may have been borrowed from one of those passport photo booths.

Mr Murdoch, who dingo-loped into the room accompanied by a bodyguard and karate-chopster wife Wendi (in pale blue nail varnish), was seated at a sparse interrogation table.

He scrunched his eyes, giving his 81-year-old face the appearance of a scowl. He could have been a character in a Pinter play.

The day was intriguing chiefly for the personality of its star witness, this leathery, contemplative, gum-sucking abo’ elder of the global power pod.

At a parliamentary committee last summer he seemed barely compos. Not yesterday. He may have taken a while to respond to some questions from the inquiry’s leading counsel, Robert Jay, QC, but that was because Citizen Rupe’s mental cogs and spools were swivelling, analysing dangers from every aspect, computing the ramifications of each word about to be glurped from his molten core.

The voice was scratchy, sometimes fluting, whistly. Mr Murdoch said that when his Sun announced it was dumping Labour, Gordon Brown telephoned. The two men had a soft-volume conversation (they’re always the nasty ones) in which Mr Brown said he would ‘make war’ on Mr Murdoch. Mr Brown was not ‘in a very balanced state of mind’. Straitjacket for Gordon!

Joint appearance: Rupert Murdoch and Tony Blair together at a news conference in 2008

Mr Brown was one of several bystanders to take some buckshot in the rump. Sir Harold Evans, ex-Murdoch editor and a darling of the Left, was horribly punctured when Mr Murdoch alleged that this great Champion of Truth once begged his boss to ‘tell me what you want me to say’. Oooh dear.

The late Woodrow Wyatt overstated his connections. Lord Patten had been a ‘very bad’ Governor of Hong Kong. When Mr Jay mentioned Fleet Street poohbah Andrew Rawnsley, Mr Murdoch drily asked: ‘Who’s he?’ A scribe from Mr Rawnsley’s sister paper enjoyed that putdown.

The judge intervened occasionally, once after Mr Murdoch said prominent people should expect to be inspected by the gumshoes of the Press. Lord Leveson wondered if that was fair about, say, actors. Were they also fair game?

One does hope the inquiry does not think politics is confined to parliamentarians and officials. Some of society’s most powerful people are in the arts and business.

As for Mr Jay, he is that scruffy one with the stubble you may have seen in coverage of the inquiry. Could be a robber caught on a petrol station’s CCTV. Or the late Kenny Everett.

If his questions seemed to move slowly, that was because they covered an impractically long period.

A Right-winger such as I might have discerned that he was not a natural reader of The Sun.

When he asked Mr Murdoch if he was a Thatcherite, he might have been asking if he had scabies.

And a reference to editorial decisions made at least this listener suspect that Mr Jay regards newspaper readers’ views as being distinctly below the salt.
