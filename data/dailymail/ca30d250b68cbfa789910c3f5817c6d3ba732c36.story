Happy birthday Happy Thanksgiving!

A Minneapolis woman named Happy Thanksgiving Reynolds will celebrate her 43rd birthday this week - really.

‘I was the child of hippies,’ the festive woman, 43, told the St Paul Pioneer Press.

Her peace-loving parents didn’t pick out a name in advance because they believed in letting karma name their bundle of joy.

‘It was total universe magic time for them,’ she said.

Being born on Thanksgiving made the decision easy for the beatniks, they made her first name Happy and her middle name Thanksgiving.

‘It also snowed that day,’ Ms Reynolds said, adding that she ‘narrowly missed the name Snow.’

The unusual name has been more benefit than burden, she explained to the paper.

The holiday-loving woman has even gotten job interviews because people want to meet someone with such an unusual name.

Ms Reynolds is one of many people in Minnesota named after the holiday’s they were born on.

There’s Christmas Eve Oberlander, Mary Christmas Pierson, Merry Eve Daher, Easter Anderson and Saint Patrick Garza.

Mr Garza prefers to go by his middle name because he isn’t perfect, he told the paper.

‘It's just something I try to avoid, really,’ he said. ‘It's hard to live up to, so I just go by Patrick Garza.’

For these people especially, it’s the most wonderful time of the year.
