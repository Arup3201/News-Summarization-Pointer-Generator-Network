It makes the stomach-churning rollercoasters at Alton Towers or Thorpe Park appear tame in comparison.

The thrill-seekers on this makeshift water ride sit in the scoop of a JCB digger and let the driver swing them high into the air, before hurling them down into the muddy water at the bottom of a quarry.

In the video footage filmed in Russia, the trio can be seen being left submerged beneath the surface of the muddy water for several seconds before finally being lifted out and launched through the air once again.

Terrifying: The video footage filmed in Russia shows three young boys sitting in the scoop of a digger as the machine lifts them into the air then dunks them into water at the bottom of a quarryÂ 

Dunked: The machine operator dunks the digger into the murky water, leaving the youngsters submerged for a number of seconds

There appears to be nothing securing the boys inside the bucket of the JCB - they merely cling to the sides of the scoop with little concern for the potential danger of such a stunt.

The three boys seem happy to put their lives in the hands of the machine operator, allowing him to dunk them into the water numerous times before lifting them through the air as fast as the excavating machine will allow him to.

The footage has been circulating widely on social media, where one person commented: 'That looks like fun but I can see something going bad really fast.'

Another said: 'Stupidity at work.'

Despite the potential for disaster, all three boys are seen emerging from the scoop unscathed, and smiling for the camera.
