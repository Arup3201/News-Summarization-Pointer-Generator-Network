When playing Patrick Swayze with a 300lbs alligator, you better hope you 'had the time of your life' as one wrong move can turn your dance partner into a killing machine.

Alligator whisperer Lance Lacrosse even manages to make the huge reptile look graceful, as he lifts it above his head in a scene reminiscent of Dirty Dancing.

The 29-year-old father-of-three has been performing the stunt for years in the swamps of Louisiana, where he works as a tour guide.

Amazed onlookers can be heard shouting in disbelief as he dives in the murky, alligator infested waters, and after emerging, he quickly begins playing with the alligators as they snap inches from his head and hands.

Lance told local media: 'I don't disrespect them, I don't try to drag them out the water, hold them down, wrestle them.

'As you seen in the video, I pick 'em up and put 'em right back down. I'm never rough with them.'

Lance's antics went viral after he was filmed feeding a marshmallow to a alligator using his mouth - but has since been dissuaded from performing that particular stunt after it was pointed out to be against Louisiana law.

However, Lance - who has been swimming with alligators since the age of nine - says he uses quick hands to prevent the alligators taking a bite out of him.

The closest he has come to being badly maimed was when one nipped his finger. He was also chased back to the boat by a 10ft alligator who narrowly missed him with a snap of his jaw.

Father-of-three Lance, from Marrero, Louisiana, said: 'Half an alligator's body is his tail. So if he even nips me a little bit, he can drag me under water.

'I make sure I got a good foot. When an alligator is coming up close to me, I'm going to reach my hand out under water and I'll judge, just right, to close his mouth.

'I'm going to close the bottom. He can swim straight up to my face but I got his mouth closed.

'So if he lunges at me, the only thing he can do is push me. He might get a little bit. But he's not going to get a big old face bite.'

Itai Etzman, who shot the spectacular video during a swamp tour last May, said: 'Everyone on the boat reacted with shock when he jumped in. We were trying to make sense of what this guy was doing.

'We weren't sure if this was a joke or not. There was one point where he had four large alligators approaching him at once and I was nervous as to how he would handle that situation.

'The alligators swam up to him and attempted to take his face off.

'I think after a couple of unsuccessful attempts, they got bored and left him alone. But he enticed them back for more with some splashing.'
