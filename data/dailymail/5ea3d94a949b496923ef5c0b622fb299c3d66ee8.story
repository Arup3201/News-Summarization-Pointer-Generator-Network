He is one of the richest pop stars of all time, with an estimated £240 million fortune – and he is now on a US tour that includes an extended stay at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, earning a reported $500,000 (£340,000) per show.

But more than 5,000 miles away from the glitzy showbiz mecca, Sir Elton John’s mother celebrated her 90th birthday in very different style – at a £14-a-head tapas restaurant near her home in West Sussex.

Sheila Farebrother is not thought to have spoken to her son for seven years after a family rift, and was joined by two friends for the modest lunch at the Restaurante Andalucia in Worthing on Thursday.

Speaking later at her £740,000 four-bedroom home on a private estate near Littlehampton, she appeared to rule out any reconciliation in the broken relationship with her rock legend son.

Asked if she had been contacted by Sir Elton during her birthday, she simply replied ‘no’, adding: ‘Anyway, it’s none of your business.’

Mrs Farebrother revealed in 2011 that the two had fallen out spectacularly, saying: ‘He has cut me off completely. I don’t want to go into what caused it. It is a painful subject. My son cut me out of his life for good.’

Family rift: Elton John with his mother and stepfather in 1971. He is still believed to support her financially

It is understood Elton was furious over comments his mother made that offended his partner, David Furnish

It is understood that the 67-year-old musician was furious over comments she made that offended his partner, David Furnish. Their relationship soured so much that Sir Elton did not go to the funeral of his stepfather Fred Farebrother in 2010.

Mrs Farebrother divorced Sir Elton’s father, Stanley Dwight, when the singer was 14.

Sir Elton is still believed to support his mother financially.

A spokesman said: ‘We never comment about Elton’s private life.’
