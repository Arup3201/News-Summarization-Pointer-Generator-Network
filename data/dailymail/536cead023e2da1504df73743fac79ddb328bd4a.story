A six-year-old girl who was left at a Chinese bath house by her grandfather as a deposit after he claimed he forgot his wallet is still living there a month on as he failed to collect her.

The girl, called Siyao, turned up at the facility in the city of Kunming in south western China's Yunnan province after her grandfather announced he wanted a good wash in a warm bath and a relaxing massage afterwards.

But when he came to pay, staff say he suddenly announced that he had forgotten his money and would need to go home to collect it.

Six-year-old Siyao who has been left behind at a Chinese bath house by her grandfather as a deposit after he said he forgot his wallet 

Siyao receives a cuddle from one of the staff at the bath house. The little girl is living there a month on after her grandfather failed to return to collect her 

Siyao has now been living in the bath house for around a month, where she has made good friends with many of the staff there 

Bath manager Mee Wang, 40, explained: 'He told the reception that would leave his granddaughter Siyao, behind as proof that he intended to return, and then left.'

But by the end of the day staff found that the grandfather had still not returned, and they were left looking after the girl who has now been living there for more than a month.

Siyao has now made good friends with the staff at the bath house, who have arranged a comfortable bed for her to sleep in overnight.

Workers at the bath house bring in food and drinks for Siyao and she also uses the facilities there to keep herself clean 

Siyao also has access to a TV and staff have arranged for it to be left switched on overnight so she doesn't feel lonely or scared 

When the centre is closed they leave a TV switched on so she doesn't feel lonely or scared.

Staff also bring in food to help feed the six-year-old and have provided her with changes in clothing.

She uses the facilities at the bath house to wash and keep herself clean.

Siyao's story was also published in the local media with an appeal for her grandfather to come forward to collect her.

The sic-year-old now has her own bed in the bath house and staff often check on her to make sure she is alright 

Her plight has been published in the local media but her grandfather has still failed to turn up and now social services have been urged to intervene 

However, he has failed to turn up meaning the girl still remains in the care of the staff, even though social services have been urged to intervene.

Bath houses are popular in Chinese cities and are used by residents who don't have central heating or running water at home.

At the centres people can take a bath, get clean, relax and enjoy a foot or body massage.
