While photographer Alexander Remnev's hobby can be highly illegal at times, the Russian teenager has a cunning ploy to keep himself out of trouble with the authorities - he simply shows security his handy work.

Remnev and his friends are 'skywalkers' who travel the world in search of skyscrapers that are the highest, scariest and hardest to reach the top of. They then climb them and take manic selfies at heights in excess of 360m. 

Their latest efforts come from skyscraper haven Hong Kong where all they needed was a camera, a customised selfie pole and nerves of steel to complete these stomach-churning images in which the intrepid self-portrait artists dangle by one hand and teeter terrifying close to the edge.

'We were lucky not to meet any police, but we did have some discussions with guards,' says Remnov. 

'Once we explained our mission to them and then showed them our cameras, they simply smiled and let us free.'

Remnov's so-called 'mission' is to see cities around the globe 'from a different point of view'.

'Whether that is the roofs of buildings or the highest points of skyscrapers, we want to show the city in a whole new way,' he says. 

'Together with my three friends from Moscow, we were able get high, really high.' 

There was no set plan in mind for the quartet in Hong Kong, just to scale structures that appealed to them.  

'We didn't have any special buildings in mind before hand, we just walked through the streets and tried to climb any buildings we liked the look of,' explains Remnov.

'There was one dangerous moment when we tried to get the top of The Center tower, it became to crowded at the top and there wasn't enough room for three of us so we decided to go back down.'

The Center is the fifth tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong and featured in the filming of blockbuster The Dark Knight.

Having scaled the most imposing structures Dubai, Kiev, Paris and more have to offer, the group rate Hong Kong highly.

'Hong Kong is one of the best places I have visited but I think I would need more than a month to visit all the best view points.

'We don't know what city we will visit next but we're certain it's going to be a city with skyscrapers!'

Remnev, having scaled the spire at the top of The Center, leans back and takes in the view of the skyscraper heavy city
