An ex-policeman was sacked from a council’s anti-social behaviour combat team after he repeatedly flicked a female colleague’s ears, a tribunal heard yesterday.

Debbie Chadwick-Edgar turned and punched Ian Napier after one incident – but then lodged a grievance that he had ‘assaulted’ her.

She also accused teammates of shunning her – and admitted calling them ‘f****** b******s’.

Ian Napier lost his job with the anti-social behaviour team at Swindon Borough Council (pictured) after colleague Debbie Chadwick-Edgar complained he repeatedly flicked her in the ear

Mrs Chadwick-Edgar, 52, said Mr 
Napier, a former firearms officer, flicked her on the ear or the back of
the head up to 12 times over five or six weeks.

Mr Napier, 60, later lost his job with the anti-social behaviour team at Swindon Council and went on to claim unfair dismissal.

His
former colleague Mrs Chadwick-Edgar, a housing officer seconded to the 
team, was called as a witness for the council at Bristol Employment 
Tribunals. Mr Napier, who represented himself, asked her when their 
working relationship broke down.

Mrs
Chadwick-Edgar replied: ‘Our working relationship changed when you hit 
me on the head or flicked my ear. It was behind me and I jumped and I 
instinctively punched you.

Ms Edgar-Chadwick said she instinctively punched Mr Napier after he flicked her ear. She claims he flicked her head or ear 12 times over six weeks

‘I
was uncomfortable with my own behaviour and uncomfortable with what you
did.’ Mr Napier then asked: ‘Do you agree there was a lot of banter, a 
lot of horseplay, within the team?’

She
replied: ‘It was never play. I don’t understand who would play in the 
office by physically assaulting another person, because that’s what it 
was to me.’

Mrs 
Chadwick-Edgar said she broke down in tears and later lodged a written 
complaint about the ear-flicking and Mr Napier ‘goading’ her.

The council held a disciplinary hearing following her punching of Mr Napier, but she was found to have been provoked.

Tony
Howell, who had worked with the team, told the tribunal he had also had
his ears flicked by Mr Napier. Asked why he did not make a formal 
complaint, he said: ‘If you knew that it upset me you would have done it
even more.’

Simon Evans, the team’s former line manager, told the tribunal he felt like a ‘nanny between a lot of children’.

The tribunal heard that Mr Napier was dismissed for his conduct after an investigation by Swindon council.

But
after hearing that other staff were highly critical of the authority’s 
handling of the dismissal, employment judge Paul Housego ruled that the 
former policeman had been unlawfully dismissed.
