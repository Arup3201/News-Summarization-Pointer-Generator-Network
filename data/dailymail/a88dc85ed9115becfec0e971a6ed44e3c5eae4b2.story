It is the ultimate home cinema - a small house that, when unfolded, becomes a 100-seater theatre capable of showing films and even staging plays.

Called Open House, it was created by artist Matthew Mazzotta, the Coleman Center for the Arts, and residents of York, Alabama.Scroll down for video

Eerie: The Open House was created using materials from an abandoned house (pictured) in Alabama. The new house sits on the footprint of the old house

‘Through open conversations, hard work and planning we have developed a project that uses the materials from an abandoned house as well as the land it sits on to build a new smaller house on the footprint of the old house,’ said Mazzotta.

‘However this new house has a secret, it physically transforms from the shape of a house into an open air theatre that seats 100 people by having its walls and roof fold down.

The unique house is already being used by residents, who helped built it using materials from an abandoned house that once stood on the site

The house takes around 90 minutes to transform, and took seven months to construct.

It was built using materials from an abandoned house that once stood on the site.

A team that included residents of the town of York took the abandoned property to pieces and recycled all the useful parts, including timber 
boards and window frames.

The ground was then levelled out by setting the remaining debris on fire. The fire brigade then put the flames out, which in turn flattened the area. 

Mazzotta's Open House was then constructed on top of reclaimed railway sleeper foundations.

The unique house is already being used by residents, including those who helped built it.

Designer Matthew Mazzotta said:¿Open House lives mostly in the form of a house between the grocery store and the post office, reminding people what was there before, but it opens up when the community wants to enjoy shows, plays and movies'

To unfold the house, the five sections along thetop ridge are pulled out and down.

There are hinges along the ground with seams that sit around halfway down each side of the roof.

The larger sections are lowered down in two stages, but because of the size and weight of the sections, this needs to be done a team of at least three people. 

Once fully unfolded, five rows of seating in three lines face an open arena.

‘Open House lives mostly in the form of a house between the grocery store and the post office, reminding people what was there before, but it opens up when the community wants to enjoy shows, plays, movies,’ said Mazzotta.

‘People took right to it and started dancing and having a good time,’ he told Dezeen.

‘When we showed the movie, all the kids sat and laid all over it like it was their living room.’

When the theatre is folded back up into the shape of a house the property is a public park.
