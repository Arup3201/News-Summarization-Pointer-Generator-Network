It was the DIY project that captured the hearts of space enthusiasts the world over - could a team of scientists really re-gain control of a long-thought dead spacecraft?

In late May they wowed us all by making first contact, and now they’ve proven their ambitions yet again by firing the thrusters on the 36-year-old spacecraft.

And today they’ll complete the first trajectory change for ISEE-3 (International Sun-Earth Explorer), with the goal of flying past the moon on 10 August and eventually entering orbit between Earth and the Sun.

A team of citizen scientists has successfully regained control of the once-thought 'dead' ISEE-3 spacecraft (illustration shown). The team made first contact with the probe in late May and has now fired the thrusters on the vehicle, with a view to flying past the moon on 10 August

The initial burn, which took place a few days ago, involved 11 ‘pulses’ of the spacecraft’s hydrazine thrusters.

ISEE-3
 was the first satellite to study the constant flow of solar wind 
streaming toward Earth from a stable orbit point between our planet and 
the sun known as the Lagrangian 1, or L1.

Monitoring that wind helped scientists better understand the 
interconnected sun-Earth system, which at its most turbulent can affect 
satellites around Earth.

In
 1984, it was given a new mission and called the International Cometary 
Explorer. In September 1985, it passed through the tail of Comet 
Giacobini-Zinner, making it the first spacecraft to gather data from a 
comet.

It also went on to 
fly by Comet Halley in March 1986. From 1991 until 1997, when it was too
 far away for reliable communications, this satellite continued to 
investigate the sun.

Now it's coming home to visit - making its closest approach to Earth in August.

This had the goal of increasing the ‘spin’ of the spacecraft from 19.16 revolutions per minute to about 19.75, almost exactly what the original mission specifications called for.

‘In other words: bullseye,’ one of the lead scientists, Keith Cowing, writes at Space College.

The team of scientists were given 
the go-ahead by Nasa to crowd-fund the revival of the seemingly 'dead' 
spacecraft earlier this year.

Contact was last made with the spacecraft, called ISEE-3 (International Sun-Earth Explorer), in the late 90s.

As it approached our planet, scientists had a brief chance to communicate with the 36-year-old probe in an
 attempt to bring it back to life - which they managed to do in late May.

‘The ISEE-3 Reboot Project is 
pleased to announce that our team has established two-way communication 
with the ISEE-3 spacecraft and has begun commanding it to perform 
specific functions,’ said Cowing at the time.

First contact with ISEE-3 was achieved at the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico, which is continuing to be used as a means to communicate with the probe.

The
 achievement was a collaboration with a number of other organisations 
and people including the staff at Arecibo and a team at the Bochum 
Observatory in Germany.

In
 April the ISEE-3 Reboot Project team - made up of the groups Space 
College, Skycorp, and SpaceRef - undertook a successful crowd funding 
project to raise £74,000 ($125,000) to rescue the probe.

Nasa
 also officially endorsed the Virginia-based project and signed a space act 
agreement for the group to take command and control of the 1970s-era 
craft.

This is the first
 time Nasa has worked on such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the 
agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again.

'We
 contacted the spacecraft after recreating hardware that was discarded 
by Nasa decades ago using command language that was recreated from old 
documents that were sitting in former employees' basements,' Cowan told MailOnline.

He also revealed how they intended to use the spacecraft for science again, and to involve citizens in it in a way not attempted before.

‘The intrepid ISEE-3 spacecraft was sent 
away from its primary mission to study the physics of the solar wind 
extending its mission of discovery to study two comets,’ said former Nasa 
astronaut John Grunsfeld.

‘We
 have a chance to engage a new generation of citizen scientists through 
this creative effort to recapture the ISEE-3 spacecraft as it zips by 
the Earth this summer.’

In 
March, amateur radio astronomers were able to track the spacecraft and 
find out its route, raising hopes that the mission could be revived.

The mission's original communication hardware no longer exists, so controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware. Once proving this was possible, the project is now using the Arecibo Radio Observatory (pictured) in Puerto Rico to send commands to ISEE-3

Launched
 in 1978 to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward 
Earth, ISEE-3 successfully completed its prime mission in 1981.

With remaining fuel and functioning instruments, it then was redirected to observe two comets.

Following
 the end of that mission, the spacecraft continued in orbit around the 
sun. It is now making its closest approach to Earth in more than 30 
years.

The goal of the 
ISEE-3 Reboot Project is to put the spacecraft into an orbit at a 
gravitationally stable point between Earth and the sun known as 
Lagrangian 1 (L1).

Once 
safely back in orbit, the next step will be to return the spacecraft to
 operations and use its instruments as they were originally designed.

ISEE-3's close approach provided optimal conditions to attempt communication.

Nasa said it had shared technical data with the amateur group to help them communicate with and return data from ISEE-3.

The
 mission’s original communication hardware no longer exists, so 
controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create 
virtual software versions of the original hardware.

Having done this, the project is using the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico to send commands to ISEE-3.

New
 data resulting from the project will be shared with the science 
community and the public, providing a unique tool for teaching students 
and the public about spacecraft operations and data gathering.

The data also will provide valuable information about the effects of the space environment on the 36-year old spacecraft.
