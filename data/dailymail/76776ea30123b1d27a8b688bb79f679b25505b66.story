North Korea has a nuclear warhead that it could mount on a missile, US intelligence officials revealed yesterday.

The warning came as preparations continued in the reclusive Communist country for the possible test launch this weekend of two missiles which it has moved closer to its border with South Korea.

However, the weapons would have a ‘low reliability’, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) said.

It is the first time Washington has admitted that Kim Jong-un’s fanatical regime has a probable nuclear capability.

The warning further increased tensions in the region ahead of celebrations in North Korea this weekend to mark the birthday of founding father Kim Il-sung.

US Secretary of State John Kerry told Kim Jong-un he would be making a ‘huge mistake’ if he went ahead with a test launch.

South Korea says Pyongyang repeatedly moved two ballistic missiles – believed to have a range of 2,100 miles and capable of reaching the US territory of Guam as well as Japan – on a mobile launcher along its east coast. North Korea often uses military shows of strength to mark important anniversaries and the fear is that at least one missile will be fired in the lead-up to Monday’s 101st anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-un’s grandfather.

Ahead of those celebrations, thousands of schoolchildren were inducted yesterday into the Korean Children’s Union, a political organisation compared to the Hitler Youth.

The warning from the DIA – the spy arm of the Pentagon – was contained in an apparently classified document handed to US politicians and revealed at a public hearing by Republican Congressman Doug Lamborn. Speaking in the South Korean capital Seoul yesterday, Mr Kerry dismissed as ‘unacceptable by any standard’ weeks of bellicose warnings of impending nuclear war by North Korea and said Washington would never accept the rogue state becoming a nuclear power.

‘If Kim Jong-un decides to launch a missile, whether it’s across the Sea of Japan or some other direction, he will be choosing wilfully to ignore the entire international community,’ Mr Kerry said.

‘And it will be a provocation and unwanted act that will raise people’s temperatures. It will further isolate his country and further isolate his people who are desperate for food and not missile launches.’

In Pyongyang, the ruling Workers’ Party vowed North Korea would not abandon its nuclear weapons, made necessary by the ‘invariable ambition of the US to militarily invade’.

While the US, Japan and South Korea have all moved anti-missile systems to protect key areas, China – Pyongyang’s closest ally – has carried out emergency civilian evacuation drills near its border.

Mr Kerry will travel to China today and said he would ask Beijing to use its influence.

US and South Korean officials played down the DIA assessment and, asked if war was imminent, one US specialist said: ‘Not at all.’ Washington’s greatest concern, the official said, was the possibility of unexpected developments linked to the inexperience of the 30-year-old leader.

‘Our greatest concern is a miscalculation and where that may lead,’ said the official.

North Korean officials have not announced plans to launch a missile, but have warned that a nuclear war is imminent. The threat is largely seen as rhetoric and an attempt to boost Kim’s military credentials.
