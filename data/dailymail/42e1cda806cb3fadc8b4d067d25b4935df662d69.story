The superbug Clostridium difficile has been linked to the deaths of 29,000 Americans a year, according to a new report.

The study found there were nearly twice as many deaths associated with the bacteria than had previously been recorded.

In the majority of cases researchers also found an infection by the deadly bug was due to the overuse of antibiotics.

In total c.difficle infects 450,000 Americans each year the report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, according to NBC News.

The bacteria causes an inflammation of the colon and causes deadly diarrhea. 

The research found the deadly microbe was 'directly attributed' to 15,000 deaths and linked to 29,000 deaths in 2011. 

More than 80 percent of the deaths associated with the infection occurred among Americans aged 65 years or older.

'C difficle infections cause immense suffering and death for thousands of Americans each year,' said CDC Director Tom Frieden.

'These infections can be prevented by improving antibiotic prescribing and by improving infection control in the health care system. 

'CDC hopes to ramp up prevention of this deadly infection by supporting State Antibiotic Resistance Prevention Programs in all 50 states.'

Studies have shown that between 30 and 50 per cent of antibiotics prescribed in hospital are unnecessary and incorrect. 

This can increase the spread of the bacteria, which can be picked up from contaminated surfaces or spread from person to person.

The new study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, cast a wider net than earlier research, which focused more on illnesses that happened in hospitals. 

It used information from laboratories in selected counties in 10 states. 

It found two-thirds of C-difficle cases occur in hospitals or nursing homes or in recently discharged patients. 

The other third were mostly people out in the community who got sick and saw a doctor. 

However the CDC has documented a 10 percent decrease in hospital-onset C. difficile infections between 2011 and 2013. 

Fighting the infections costs hospitals $4.8 billion each year, according to the CDC.
