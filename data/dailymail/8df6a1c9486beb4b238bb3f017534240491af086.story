Proudly cradling his baby daughter, Tom James is living a life he could hardly have imagined five years ago.

Then, the soldier touched the nation’s hearts when, despite devastating injuries from a bomb in Afghanistan, he left hospital to attend the funeral of his best friend, who died in the blast.

Now Mr James is keeping the promise he made to live life to the maximum, despite losing his right arm and right eye when the Taliban IED exploded in Helmand province in August 2009.

Living life to the full: Tom James, who lost an arm and an eye in a Taliban attack in 2009, with his baby daughter Evie

For as well as finding love and becoming a father, he also has a job.

The 25-year-old's best friend, Fusilier Shaun Bush, who was killed in the explosion trying to save their platoon commander.

Five weeks after his death, Mr James, from Coventry, was wheeled into his friend's funeral service to pay his respects. 

Images
 of the wounded soldier wrapped in bandages and carrying medical 
equipment were shared around the world and became synonymous with the 
sacrifice given by British soldiers throughout the bloody conflict.

Five
 years later, after teaching himself to write, walk and dress himself 
again, Mr James has welcomed a daughter and is due to marry.

'Having
 a daughter is the best thing ever, and if I’d never been in the army 
and if I hadn't stepped on the IED, I wouldn’t have met Kellie and 
I wouldn't have had Evie, so I don’t regret it for a second,' he said.

Speaking of his friend's funeral five years ago, the soldier said: 'I’m not a hero, you just do what you have to do.

'There
 are hundreds of people right now who are going through what I did. What
 I’d say to them, is never give up - perseverance is the key.

'I believe the greatest way to honour those killed in Afghanistan is to live the life you have, to the full.

'And that’s what I’ve done since I came back and what I will continue to do.'

Mr
 James was 20 when he was blown up alongside other soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, in Afghanistan.

His comrade and best friend, Mr Bush, was killed trying to rescue platoon commander Sergeant Simon Valentine. 

He was taken to the military hospital at Camp Bastion for emergency surgery with a broken leg and severe burns. 

From there he was flown to the Critical Care Unit in Birmingham, before being sent to Headley Court, the military's medical rehabilitation centre in Surrey.

He added: 'I don’t really remember it happening - it only took an instant.

'Although
 I was awake at the time, I had so much adrenaline rushing through me 
that the first thing I remember is my mates giving me morphine.

'I knew straight away that my arm was gone and I came to terms with it there and then

'My eye didn’t go until I got back to Birmingham. I had 12 hours in Camp Bastion first.

'When I was blown up, the lads were pulling me along by my legs, but they didn’t know that my leg was broken when they did it.'

Despite 
requiring round-the-clock medical care, Mr James left hospital to attend
 the funeral in Coventry in his military uniform.

Mr James said his way of honouring his friends and colleagues killed in conflict was to live life 'to the full'

'Love at first sight': From the moment she met the soldier, Miss Boyle says she knew she wanted to marry him

Wearing
 an eye patch and carrying medical equipment to keep his burned skin 
from falling apart, his image became a humbling symbol for sacrifice in 
the Middle East. 

His
 fiancee, Kellie Boyle, said she had no idea who he was when she first 
met him in a nightclub four years ago, though described him as a 'hero'.
   

'We
 met a couple of times and it was love at first sight. I started 
chatting to him and I just knew he was the one,' said Miss Boyle.

'He told me what had happened to him in Afghanistan and I was amazed he was so calm about it all.

'I
 remember seeing the pictures of him on the front pages of the paper 
being wheeled into the cathedral but it never clicked that it was him.

'I hadn't put a name to the face and didn't know much about him or what had happened.'

The couple, who have a daughter, Evie, live together in Coventry with Miss Boyle's son, Brandon.  

'He is so amazing, he is very brave and the way he deals with it is incredible. He tries to live life to the full and he is an inspiration.

'To do what he does and the way he always tries to help other people despite what happened to him is amazing. He is my hero.

'Tom
 says he actually feels lucky that he was injured in the bomb because he
 survived when others didn't and he met me soon afterwards.

'I've never met anyone with such a positive outlook,' she added.

After struggling to find work, Mr James now works for a charity which raises money for wounded servicemen and women.

Mr James said he did what 'anyone else would have done' in attending the service and plans to live life to the full to honour those killed in combat 

He is a keen golfer and regularly takes part in fundraising tournaments across the country. 

Speaking of returning to 'normal' life, Mr James said: 'At first it was very hard and everything was completely different.

'At that point, I was still in the army. When I got out, I thought ‘right, it’s time to knuckle down and get a job’.

'I applied for around 200 jobs - and they weren't rocket science, just ordinary jobs. I got none of them.

'Because of my disabilities, civilian employers wouldn't touch me.'

'I’d never played golf before I got injured, but sport has always been a big part of my life.

'Golf is the only sport in which disabled and able-bodied people can have a competitive game together.

'I had to learn to play with just one arm, and I’m now on a handicap of 26 now, which isn't too bad.'
