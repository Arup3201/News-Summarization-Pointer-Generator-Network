Pepe is the most cherished player of the Portuguese public, mainly because of his enormous empathy with the people.

He always has a smile on his face for the fans, is the first to sign autographs and even expresses more emotion when singing the national anthem than his Portuguese-born team-mates.

Unlike other Brazilian players who have played for Portugal, Pepe has always been popular with the Portuguese people.

Ouch! Pepe leaned into Muller after the pair had begun a spat with Portugal already two goals down

The controversies that he was involved with at Real Madrid never affected how much Portuguese people saw him, because they understood his extreme passion in defending his club

This time, however, by getting sent off for his headbutt on Thomas Muller in Portugal’s 4-0 defeat to Germany, his image appears much more spoiled in Portugal.

The press didn't spare him after the game and the public vox pops also saw him heavily criticised.

But knowing Pepe, he willl issue a public apology and will be forgiven again. And that should happen in the next few days, in a way that pleases the Portuguese Federation, because they also want him to clean up his image.

For example, the main theme in Portugal the day after this controversy are the injuries of Fabio Coentrao and Hugo Almeida. Pepe’s sending off is of less importance.

If you asked the majority of Portuguese people if they still want Pepe to play, perhaps a few would say no today, but in a few days most would say yes.

Laying down the gauntlet: Muller ended up netting a hat-trick for Germany in their opening game win

Every little helps: Pepe is one of Cristiano Ronaldo's best friends which aids his relationship with the public

The vast majority, over 90 per cent, will say that the player born in Brazil must be in the team.

We may well say that Pepe's image has been damaged after the Germany defeat, but not enough, as we say here in Portugal, to put his head on the guillotine.

The fact that he's one of Cristiano Ronaldo’s closest friends also helps him within the national squad and the Portuguese people.

Everyone knows, even those most critical of his behaviour, that without Pepe Portugal will struggle to beat USA or Ghana, because Neto or Ricardo Costa are not at his level.

Also because his importance to the team, the Portuguese Federation didn't criticise the player after his red card and his behaviour. For sure if it was another player without Pepe’s influence on the team, the treatment would be very different.
