Some of the secrets of Saturn’s pock-marked moon Phoebe have been revealed, with Nasa scientists discovering that it is actually remarkably planet-like.

Thanks to data beamed back from the agency’s Cassini probe, which has been loitering nearby, astronomers now know that the moon is far rounder than previously thought.

What’s more, they believe that the moon may have actually been warm for tens of millions of years – and probably hosted water.

Rock on: Phoebe's true nature is revealed in startling clarity in this mosaic of two images taken during Cassini's flyby on June 11, 2004, from 20,200 miles away

Scientists had their first close-up look at Phoebe when Cassini began exploring the Saturn system in 2004.

Using data from multiple spacecraft instruments and a computer model of the moon's chemistry, geophysics and geology, scientists found Phoebe was a so-called planetesimal, or remnant planetary building block.

‘Unlike primitive bodies such as comets, Phoebe appears to have actively evolved for a time before it stalled out,’ said Julie Castillo-Rogez, a planetary scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

‘Objects like Phoebe are thought to have condensed very quickly. Hence, they represent building blocks of planets. They give scientists clues about what conditions were like around the time of the birth of planets and their moons.’

Cassini images suggest Phoebe originated in the far-off Kuiper Belt, the region of ancient, icy, rocky bodies beyond Neptune's orbit.

Rounding out the facts: This panel of images shows the nearly spherical shape of Phoebe

Saturn lies 890 million miles from the Sun on average.

It has a diameter of 74,897 miles.

It’s a very very cold planet, with an average temperature of -140C (-220F).

It’s made of liquid and solid hydrogen and helium and is so light it would float on water.

It’s most famous for its rings, which were first discovered in the 17th-century. They extend 46,000 miles out and have a total diameter of almost 170,000 miles.

It has 60 moons – more than any other planet in the solar system, bar Jupiter. One of them, Titan, is the second largest in the solar system and actually has an atmosphere – composed mainly of nitrogen.

Saturn is extremely stormy, with winds gusting at 1,000mph at the equator.

Data show Phoebe was spherical and hot early in its history, and has denser rock-rich material concentrated near its centre. Its average density is about the same as Pluto, another object in the Kuiper Belt.

Phoebe likely was captured by Saturn's gravity when it somehow got close to the giant planet.

Saturn is surrounded by a cloud of irregular moons that circle the planet in orbits tilted from Saturn's orbit around the sun, the so-called equatorial plane.

Phoebe is the largest of these irregular moons and also has the distinction of orbiting backward in relation to the other moons. Saturn's large moons appear to have formed from gas and dust orbiting in the planet's equatorial plane. These moons currently orbit Saturn in that same plane.

‘By combining Cassini data with modeling techniques previously applied to other solar system bodies, we've been able to go back in time and clarify why it is so different from the rest of the Saturn system,’ said Jonathan Lunine, a co-author on the study and a Cassini team member at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.

Analyses suggest that Phoebe was born within the first three million years of the birth of the solar system, which occurred 4.5 billion years ago.

The moon may originally have been porous but appears to have collapsed in on itself as it warmed up. Phoebe developed a density 40 per cent higher than the average inner Saturnian moon.

Objects of Phoebe's size have long been thought to form as ‘potato-shaped’ bodies and remained that way over their lifetimes.

If such an object formed early enough in the solar system's history, it could have harboured the kinds of radioactive material that would produce substantial heat over a short timescale. This would warm the interior and reshape the moon.

‘From the shape seen in Cassini images and modelling the likely cratering history, we were able to see that Phoebe started with a nearly spherical shape, rather than being an irregular shape later smoothed into a sphere by impacts,’ said co-author Peter Thomas, a Cassini team member at Cornell.

Phoebe likely stayed warm for tens of millions of years before freezing up. The study suggests the heat also would have enabled the moon to host liquid water at one time.

This could explain the signature of water-rich material on Phoebe's surface previously detected by Cassini.

The new study also is consistent with the idea that several hundred million years after Phoebe cooled, the moon drifted toward the inner solar system in a solar-system-wide rearrangement. Phoebe was large enough to survive this turbulence.

More than 60 moons are known to orbit Saturn, varying drastically in shape, size, surface age and origin. Scientists using both ground-based observatories and Cassini's cameras continue to search for others.

The findings appear in the April issue of the Journal Icarus.
