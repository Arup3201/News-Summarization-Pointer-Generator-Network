ISIS terrorists convicted of car bombings in Baghdad have been forced to face their victims' families in an Iraqi reality television show. 

Shackled and flanked by armed military officers, the men are returned to the scene of the bombings carried out across the ravaged city last month. 

There, they must face the wrath of their victims' families as camera crews film the heartbreaking exchange for the programme, In the Grip of the Law.

Terrorist Haider Ali Motar weeps on camera as he is confronted by the son of a man killed in a car bombing he helped organise in Baghdad as part of the new reality TV programme

In one scene, convicted bomber Haider Ali Motar wails as a man in a wheelchair spits verbal abuse towards him.  

Others tell the 21-year-old they will 'tear him to pieces' from behind a barbed wire fence. 

The show's presenter said it had been designed to demonstrate those responsible for terrorism offences are brought to justice, while others working on the programme hoped it would deter criminals from re-offending. 

'We wanted to produce a program that offers clear and conclusive evidence, with the complete story, presented and shown to Iraqi audiences,' Ahmed Hassan said. 

'Through surveillance videos, we show how the accused parked the car, how he blew it up, how he carries out an assassination.

'We show our audiences the pictures, along with hard evidence, to leave no doubts that this person is a criminal and paying for his crimes.'

A senior intelligence officer overseeing the filming added: 'Many of these terrorists feel a lot of remorse when they see the victims.  

'When people see that, it makes them think twice about crossing the law.'

Among clips shown in the programme are those of prisoners confessions to their crimes on camera and police examining DNA and ballistics evidence from the scene.

But human rights groups have expressed concern over the airing of filmed confessions, claiming any admission will have been made under duress.

Human rights groups have expressed concern over taped confessions aired on the programme amid claims the prisoners would only have made such admissions under duress

'The justice system is so flawed and the rights of detainees, especially those accused of terrorism (but not only) are so routinely violated that it is virtually impossible to be confident that they would be able to speak freely,' Donatella Rovera, of Amnesty International, said. 

'In recent months, which I have spent in Iraq, virtually every family I have met who has a relative detained has complained that they do not have access to them, and the same is true for lawyers.'

In one episode of In the Grip of the Law, prisoner Motar is seen acting nervously when asked to say something on camera. 

'What am I supposed to say,' he says, before being urged to perform a mic check.   

ISIS militants have ravaged the country in recent months, detonating car bombs and launching vicious conflicts with troops defending border towns. 

Their efforts have been backed by Shiite and Kurdish militias as well as U.S.-led airstrikes, clawing back some of the country's key military territory. 

Around a third of Iraq, including its second largest city, Mosul, remains under the oppressive regime of the Islamic State.
