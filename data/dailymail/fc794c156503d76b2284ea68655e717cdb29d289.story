Thousands waited in line for the opening of a new restaurant in Lille in the north of the country with managers promising free meals as part of an opening day promotion.

A passer-by captured footage of enormous queues forming outside the new Burger King as crowds waited for hours to be among the first to walk through the doors of the outlet.
