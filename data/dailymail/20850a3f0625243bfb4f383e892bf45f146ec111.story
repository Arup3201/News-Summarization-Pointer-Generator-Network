The heir to Camelot gallantly hand-delivered the Profile in Courage award to George H. W. Bush at his home in Kennebunkport on Monday.

John Schlossberg, a 21-year-old senior at Yale, was thoughtful enough to also bring a pair of socks printed with the silhouette of his grandfather JFK.

The Profile in Courage honor recognized former President Bush's willingness to compromise with Democrats on a tax deal in 1990 after pledging to voters he would not raise taxes.

'America’s gain was President Bush’s loss,' the Boston Globe reports Schlossberg said of the tax compromise, which helped bridge a gap in the federal deficit and eased political deadlock.

'His decision to put country above party and political prospects make him an example of a modern profile in courage that is all too rare,' Schlossberg added.

George H. W. Bush was unable to make the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in May, so Lauren Bush accepted the honor on her grandfather's behalf. 

'At age 89 and 7/8, let me assure you kind words really do matter,' read a statement from former President Bush. 'Thank you again for remembering what our team tried to do, lo, those many years ago.'

The son of Caroline Kennedy, Schlossberg is JFK's only grandson, and has in recent years taking the responsibility for speaking for the family at events such as the 50th anniversary of JFK Airport in New York.

He's also attracted attention for his looks. During his mother's swearing in ceremony as ambassador to Japan, a Twitter user gushed, 'When did Caroline Kennedy's son become such a 10?'

Statesman: Schlossberg is currently training to be an Emergency Medical Technician, but he's also done public speaking that has some guessing he'll become a budding public figure

Another admired fantasized, 'I can't wait to marry into the Kennedy family.' 

As for the bipartisan sock gift, former President Bush calls himself a 'self-proclaimed sock man' according to Esquire.

'I don't know what your guilty pleasures are in life, but one of mine is socks,' Bush wrote in a Republican National Committee email offering a pair of monogrammed socks in exchange for donations.

The socks cost $10 on the John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum website.
