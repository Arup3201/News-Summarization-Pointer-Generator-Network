Buyers snapped up more than £200million worth of property in the hours after George Osborne announced sweeping changes to stamp duty.

The Chancellor’s reforms on the transaction tax in his Autumn Statement sparked one of the busiest periods for estate agents in 25 years.

One overseas buyer saved £1.4million in stamp duty when contracts on a £30million house in Surrey were exchanged just 15 minutes before midnight on Wednesday – after which the new rules applied.

Books editor Louise Bolotin will pay just £99 in stamp duty following a complete reform of the tax system.

The first-time buyer is in the process of buying a spacious £129,950 one-bedroom flat in a Grade II listed converted warehouse in Manchester’s city centre.

At 53, Miss Bolotin was only able to buy her own home when she inherited some money.

She said that now her stamp duty bill had been slashed from £1,290 to just £99, it will make the moving process less painfully expensive.

Miss Bolotin, an editor for financial books, said she will use her windfall of almost £1,200 to buy a new bathroom.

She said: ‘This has come at the perfect time for me. The offer was agreed two or three weeks ago and I have just started the conveyancing process.

‘I am a massive winner from this. I knew I needed to do up the bathroom but now I can buy more expensive fittings. I’m very happy about the changes, as you might imagine.’

The sale of a second £30million house – in upmarket Hampstead in London – went through at 11.30pm.

Estate agents are predicting a property boom in the run-up to Christmas and into the New Year as families raise their offers and first-time buyers realise they could afford to buy sooner.

The new system will replace the unpopular ‘slab structure’, that led stamp duty to be labelled ‘the worst designed tax in Britain’, with a gradually increasing rate.

The changed rules – said to benefit 98 per cent of buyers – mean the so-called ‘cliff edge’ where the tax was charged on a whole value of a property is replaced by gradually rising charges in a string of bands.

It means someone buying an average-priced home worth £273,000 will be about £4,500 better off.

Yesterday the switch triggered a flood of calls to solicitors and estate agents as sellers and buyers rushed to capitalise on the change.

First-time buyers Chris Pacey and Katie Vincent were delighted to discover they will save £780 after their stamp duty bill was reduced.

The couple have had an offer accepted on a £172,000 three-bedroom home in East Leake, Loughborough, and hope to exchange contracts on Monday.

Lab technician Miss Vincent, 30, and her boyfriend, a manager of a food store, have been living with her parents for three years to save enough money for a deposit.

But after finding their dream home, a three-bedroom detached house, they felt annoyed about paying a stamp duty bill of £1,720 – 1 per cent of the value of their home. 

Now, they will pay 2 per cent on only the portion above the threshold of £125,000, which comes to £940.

Mr Pacey, 27, said: ‘We can use the extra money on home improvements. I think the new system is much fairer.’

Sellers who had been previously forced to undervalue their home to keep the price below stamp duty bands of £250,000, £500,000 and £1million are hoping to increase the sale price.

Nick Riddle, at estate agents Eadon Lockwood and Riddle in Sheffield, said: ‘We have already received calls offering asking prices on 15 properties that had previously received lower offers.

New mortgage rules caused a shock slowdown in the housing market, official figures have revealed.

The small print of a report issued by the Office for Budget Responsibility describes how home loan regulations introduced in April caused sales to plunge by almost 10 per cent more than expected.

Though the OBR does not say why this happened, previously experts have blamed banks and building societies for making it too difficult for borrowers to get a mortgage. Since April, homebuyers have faced a forensic probe into their personal finances before they are allowed to take out a loan.

The shake-up, known as the Mortgage Market Review, was supposed to ensure that the irresponsible lending that led to the 2008 crisis was not repeated.

But in its economic forecasts, the OBR said: ‘It appears that the regulations have had a larger and more persistent effect than we had assumed.’

Critics say the Mortgage Market Review has gone too far. The changes mean that instead of simply providing three months of bank statements as they did previously, borrowers must now go through a three-hour interview where every aspect of their savings and spending is probed.

Brokers have reported borrowers being quizzed about how often they have friends over for dinner and if they ate steak.

Banks say they are frightened of falling foul of the new rules. But the FCA has accused lenders of misinterpreting the rules and defying ‘common sense’.

‘Now that buyers aren’t burdened in the same way by outdated stamp duty fees, they are better placed to pay what the property is really worth.’

Kevin Hollinrake, of Hunters estate agents, based in North and East Yorkshire, said: ‘Minutes after the changes were announced we had two or three people on the phone increasing their offers by £5,000 or more because of the stamp duty saving.

‘We were working late last night and received well over 100 calls from clients within the first hour and a half of opening.’

While most buyers will be better off, stamp duty for homes over £937,500 has risen.

Lawyers were paid bonus fees of up to £10,000 to get the paperwork finished before midnight to save their clients vast sums of money.

Beauchamp Estate Agents said it pushed through sales on homes worth a combined £100million between the delivery of the Autumn Statement and midnight.

Those who failed to exchange contracts on their property before midnight now face hefty stamp duty bills. A £2million home will cost £53,000 more than it would have two days ago.

One buyer buying a £7.5million home in Knightsbridge faced huge disappointment after attempts to rush through a sale before midnight failed, costing them £288,000, according to Rokstone estate agents.

But many more were successful. Mark Pollack, of London’s Aston Chase estate agents, said his team managed to get three multi-million-pound deals through before midnight.

He said: ‘The last time I can remember a day of so much anxiety was when interest rates went up to 15 per cent in the 1980s.’

Simon Rose, of Strutt & Parker’s Chelsea office, said it was the busiest night that he could remember for 25 years, rushing through four sales of multi-million homes at the last minute.

Trevor Abrahmsohn, of Glentree International, said sales of luxury homes would fall because of the 12 per cent stamp duty on homes over £1.5million.

Instead, there would be a ‘boom’ in basement conversions as the rich chose to extend their homes rather than move.

Your stamp duty bill may be reduced, but also getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible.
