President Barack Obama's new
plan to spare 4.7 million illegal immigrants from the threat of deportation violates the U.S. Constitution, a
federal judge declared on Tuesday, handing down the first legal
ruling against the plan.

Judge Arthur Schwab's ruling has no immediate impact, since the Obama administration says there was no reason for his Western District of Pennsylvania court to address the issue in the
case, which concerns the legal status of 42-year-old Honduran immigrant Elionardo
Juarez-Escobar.

Schwab is the first judge to rule on the legality of the
plan Obama announced on Nov. 20. The executive action by the
Democratic president is opposed by Republicans and has already been legally challenged by two dozen U.S. states.

'President Obama's unilateral legislative action violates the separation of powers provided for in the United States Constitution as well as the Take Care Clause, and therefore is unconstitutional,' Judge Schwab wrote.

The 'Take Care Clause' of the Constitution requires the president to faithfully execute laws passed by Congress.

Schwab also ruled that the policy gives illegal immigrants a path 'to obtain substantive rights' that belong only to citizens and legal U.S. residents.

U.S. senators from both sides of the aisle weighed in on Tuesday outside the Senate chamber.

'I obviously agree with the idea that the action he took was an unlawful and unconstitutional action,' South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune told MailOnline, noting that he had not yet read the ruling.

'I wish the president was a little bit more – I wish he had accepted the results of the election and decided that it was time, maybe, to go in a different direction,' Thune said. 'I don't know that he got the message.'

'Coming out right away with the immigration decision' after the Democrats' disastrous midterm shellacking 'wasn't helpful,' he said.

Democratic Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois shot back: 'I think he's wrong' – referring to Judge Schwab, not Sen. Thune – before slipping onto the Senate floor and out of reach of reporters.

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat told MailOnline that Schwab made 'an incorrect ruling,' and then abruptly ended his press availability. 

The administration has defended its policy by classifying it as an example of prosecutorial discretion,- a special case of a mundane and widely accepted authority granted to court officials who often must choose which cases to bring to trial and which to dismiss.

But Schwab ruled that the president’s policy goes 'beyond' that, setting up a hard-and-fast framework for evaluating applications from millions of people – the opposite of a case-by-case determination.

Obama's executive action 'goes beyond prosecutorial discretion,' he wrote. 'It is legislation.'

Schwab says he ruled on the executive action issue because
he concluded that Juarez-Escobar could be eligible for relief
under the executive action, a situation that required him to dive into the minutiae of what Obama's plan does and doesn't do.

Government lawyers told Schwab that Juarez-Escobar, who has
pleaded guilty to re-entering the country, was not eligible
because Obama's order does not affect criminal proceedings.

Schwab was named to the federal bench in 2002 by President George W. Bush, a Republican. 

His other most noteworthy ruling came a year later, when he presided over a case involving 'Up In Smoke' actor Tommy Chong for conspiracy to distribute marijuana bongs. 

Schwab sentenced Chong to nine months in federal prison.
