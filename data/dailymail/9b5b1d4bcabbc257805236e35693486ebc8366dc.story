A bill awarding compensation to the victims of Cleveland kidnapper and rapist Ariel Castro is set to be voted on this week by the Ohio legislature.

Kidnapped, held prisoner, abused and raped for about a decade by the madman, Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight would receive $25,000 for each year they were held if the bill is voted into law.

The money would come from  the Ohio Court of Claims’ victims of crime fund, according to the Cleveland Plain-Dealer.

Under those guidelines, Ms Knight would receive $275,000, Ms Berry $250,000 and Ms DeJesus $225,000.

Local officials are also looking for a federal waiver to grant the victims Medicaid for life, according to the paper.

Should the three women decide to go to school, the state would pay their tuition and living expenses if they enrolled in a state university or college, the paper said.

News of the reparations comes only two weeks after Mr Castro was found dead in the Ohio jail cell to which he was sentenced to serve 1,000 years.

Initially ruled a suicide, it is now believed the deranged man, found hanging in his cell, died while trying to give himself sexual thrills from auto-erotic asphyxiation.

The bill is being brought to the Ohio Assembly by John Barnes (R-Cleveland), who wants the state government to provide assistance to anyone held in captivity for eight years or more, according to the paper.

‘The proposal isn't a giveaway but rather an opportunity for three women to build a better future by giving them access to an education and other life experiences,’ Mr Barnes told the paper.

‘We are merely trying to restore what they lost as a result of their involuntary servitude,’ he added.
