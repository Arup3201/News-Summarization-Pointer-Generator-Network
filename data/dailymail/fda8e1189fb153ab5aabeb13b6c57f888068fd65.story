The driver of a bin lorry which crashed killing six people in Glasgow last year will not face charges, authorities have announced.

Harry Clarke, 58, collapsed at the wheel of the council refuse truck three days before Christmas, causing it to veer onto the pavement before crashing into a hotel.

Neither he nor the vehicle's owner, Glasgow City Council, will face charges after prosecutors in Scotland studied a police report into the tragedy, it emerged today.

In a statement, Scotland's Crown Office said today: 'The Police report has now been carefully considered by Crown Counsel - the most senior lawyers within the Crown Office.

'Crown Counsel have concluded that the driver of the lorry should not be prosecuted in respect of this tragic incident.

'Despite its catastrophic consequences there is no evidence to suggest that the driver's conduct at the time amounted to a breach of the criminal law.

'There is no evidence to support a prosecution of Glasgow City Council in respect of any Health and Safety concerns breaches in Health and Safety law.' 

Investigators have refused to speculate on claims Mr Clarke suffered a heart attack at the wheel. 

John 'Jack' Sweeney, 68, his wife Lorraine, 69, and their 18-year-old granddaughter Erin McQuade were all shopping when struck and killed by the truck.

Primary school teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, tax worker Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh also died in the crash.

Mr Clarke has previously said he thinks about each victim 'every minute of every day'.

Crown lawyers decided that a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) should be held 'to ensure that there can be a full public hearing of the facts of the case'.

They will petition the courts within two weeks for the inquiry to be held as soon as possible.

A Crown Office spokesman said: 'A Fatal Accident inquiry is held into cases where a death or deaths were sudden, suspicious, or unexplained or occurred in circumstances such as to give rise to serious public concern.'

Relatives of those who died in the incident have been informed of the decision not to bring a prosecution and to hold an FAI  'to determine the cause of the crash and establish what lessons can be learned from this tragic incident'.

Mr Clarke has said he cannot 'remember anything at all' about the crash and was completely unaware he had heart problems until after the incident.

He told the Daily Record: 'I understand a lot of people want to know what happened that day. I wish I could tell you but I can't. I just want all of the families of the injured and deceased to know I can't remember anything.

'Nothing will ever be normal for the families or me ever again. Every day is a struggle.'

The accident - just days before Christmas - led to an outpouring of grief among shocked Glaswegians

Two refuse workers in the back of the bin lorry's cab attempted to rouse him but were prevented from stopping the truck by a safety rail in the vehicle. Mr Clarke tested negative for drink-driving.

Patrick McGuire, a partner with Thompsons Solicitors, which is representing some of those affected by the crash, said: 'This announcement from the Crown Office is very welcome.

'It begins the process of finding out what happened to cause this terrible accident, which is of the greatest importance to the victims and their relatives.

'My clients and I are particularly heartened that the Crown has moved so quickly towards convening an FAI. It has often been the case that years can pass before an FAI is set up, if indeed one is set up at all. This leads to further anguish to victims and their families.

'Therefore the Crown Office is to be commended for its swift action, which reflects the huge public concern about this accident.'

A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: 'We will provide any assistance that the inquiry needs.'
