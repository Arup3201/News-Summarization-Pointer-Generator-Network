Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert refused to shake Jose Mourinho's hand on Saturday because the Chelsea boss left before the full time whistle.

Chelsea were leading 3-0 when Mourinho decided to beat the traffic and walk down the Stamford Bridge tunnel, but the 'Special One' halted to say his goodbyes to Lambert and assistant manager Roy Keane first.

Instead, Lambert snubbed the 51-year-old's prematurely out-stretched hand and pointed to his watch to tell the former Real Madrid and Inter Milan manager that time wasn't quite up yet.

Lambert couldn't understand why Mourinho was leaving the Stamford Bridge arena before full-time 

Assistant manager Roy Keane was in no mood to get involved in any pleasantries either 

It was more of an acknowledgement than Keane offered, though, as the stern former Manchester United midfielder simply ignored him. 

Mourinho previously admitted after being criticised for leaving early during Chelsea's 6-0 win against Arsenal in March that he was born of a desire to phone his wife with the result.

He won't be too preoccupied by his latest snub, however, as he turns his attention to the Champions League for Chelsea's clash against Sporting Lisbon.

The Chelsea manager held a training session at Cobham on Monday before jetting to Portugal with his Premier League table-topping squad for the Group G match.

John Terry is likely to make his 100th Champions League appearance for Chelsea.
