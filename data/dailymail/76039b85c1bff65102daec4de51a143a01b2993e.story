A seven-year-old called 999 when her heavily pregnant mother started having life-threatening convulsions - and then had to direct an ambulance driver to the maternity wing.

Mum-of-three Louise Evans, 30, was at 35 weeks when she collapsed and suffered a pre-eclampsic fit at home with daughters Evie, seven, and Belle Norman, five.

Instead of panicking, cool-headed Evie ran into the house, grabbed the phone and called an ambulance - telling the operator that her mother was asleep and wouldn't wake up.

She carefully followed instructions until the ambulance service arrived and rushed her mother to nearby Doncaster Royal Infirmary - where she gave birth just three hours later.

But once they arrived in the hospital grounds, the ambulance driver couldn't find the maternity wing, as he was used to going straight to the emergency room.

So Evie, who had been to the department with her mother for scans, stepped up again and directed him to the right building on August 30 last year.

'Evie was giving him directions, telling him 'that way' and 'round there', because she'd been to appointments with me before,' said Mrs Evans.

Pre-eclampsia can cause fits and other complications, as well as low birth weight and premature birth for the baby.

Pre-eclampsia is a condition that can develop in pregnant women. 

Women with pre-eclampsia have high blood pressure and protein in their urine.  

Severe pre-eclampsia can be life-threatening for both mother and baby.

In the baby it can cause growth problems and a premature birth.

Symptoms include:

The severe convulsions, caused by high blood pressure, can be life-threatening for both mother and baby. 

The only cure for pre-eclampsia is for the baby to be born.

Mrs Evans gave birth to her third baby girl later that day - and to say thank you for saving her and the baby's life, she allowed Evie and Belle to name her - which they did, calling her Alice.

She had been watching Evie and Belle - now aged eight and seven - dressing up as princesses and putting on shows during the hot afternoon last year.

'I went inside to get them a drink, and that's the last thing I can remember.

'Putting together what I've been told, I collapsed onto the grass as I walked back outside with the drinks.

'Evie said she tried to wake me up, but I wouldn't wake, so she ran inside and grabbed the phone and called 999.

'Ever since my girls were little, I've always made sure they know what to do in an emergency, what their address is, I made up little songs to sing with Evie about our phone number so she could remember it easily.

'I don't know why, I think because I work with children, I was always aware that they needed to know what to do in an emergency.

'So Evie rang the operator and told her mummy was asleep and wouldn't wake up.

'They explained to Evie how to put me into the recovery position, so Evie and Bell put me onto my left side, raised my head.'

Dr David Macklin, Deputy Medical Director at Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'Louise's children are to be commended for staying calm'

At one point, the operator asked Evie to check her mum's mouth for food or vomit, asking: 'Is there anything in her mouth?'

And she replied: 'Just her teeth'.

The ambulance took around ten or 15 minutes to arrive, and Mrs Evans woke up as the paramedics walked into the garden.

'Evie and Belle weren't upset the whole time they were on the phone, but as soon as I came round, they got upset,' she said.

'I think they were just relieved, and I kept asking them if they were ok.

'It's a really scary thought that for that period of time, they were just fending for themselves with noone to look after them.'

Mrs Evans was told she would need an emergency caeserian to deliver Alice.

She arrived safely at 8.15pm - just three hours after Evie made the 999 phone call and spent a week in the neo-natal unit while her breathing difficulties were resolved.

'Evie and Belle got to meet Alice before I did - because I was being treated in a separate ward so couldn't see Alice for a few days,' said Mrs Evans.

'I told them they could name her, because they saved her life - so they called her Alice, after Alice in Wonderland.' 

Dr David Macklin, Deputy Medical Director at Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'Louise's children are to be commended for staying calm and doing all the right things when faced with this daunting situation.

'They carried out the right actions to get help for their Mum, didn't panic and did everything asked of them by our telephone adviser in the Emergency Operations Centre so that immediate care could be provided for Louise until the ambulance crew arrived on scene.' 

Operator: Are you outside?

Evie: Yeah, we're in the back garden.

O: Is anybody else there with you?

E: No, just me and my sister.

O: Right, how old is your sister?

E: My sister is five.

O: Can you get her to go and get a pillow?

E: [whispering to sister, 'get a pillow']

O: And bring it back to mummy as quick as she can.

E: She is, she's running

O: How old are you?

E: I'm seven

O: You're doing very well, your're helping mummy.

E: What do you want her to do with the pillow?

O: You've got the pillow?

E: Yeah

O: You need to place her on her left side. Do you know which is your right and

which is your left?

E: Mmmm, yes [whispers to sister: 'left side']

O: Place mummy on her left side with the pillow wedged behind her lower back.

E: We've done that

O: Have you done that?

E: Errr, yeah

O: Ok my lovely, kneel next to her and look into her mouth for food or vomit.

Is there anything in her mouth?

E: Errr... just her teeth.

O: Ok lovely, now place your hand on mummy's forehead and the other hand on

mummy's neck and tilt her head back.

E: Yeah, yeah, yeah

O: Put your ear next to her mouth

E: Yeah

O: Can you feel or hear any breathing?

E: Yeah, she is breathing

O: Is she breathing normally?

E: Err ... I think it's quite about normal

O: Ok, we're going to do a breathing test, so every time mummy takes a breath,

you say 'now' to me, starting now

E: Ok, now.... now... now... now...

O: That's fine, that's ok. Stay right with her and make sure her had is tilted

back. If she vomits you need to clean her mouth and nose but I'll stay with you

on the phone so tell me when the ambulance crew is right with her or if

anything changes.

E: Ok. Thank you

O: That's ok, you're doing really well.

[Evie can be heard telling her sister 'under lower back' and whispering

inaudibly]

O: Do you want me to repeat anything?

E: Yes, please

[Operator repeats instructions about pillow]

E: She is blinking her eyelids [can be heard saying 'mummy, mummy']

O: Is she responding at all?

E: Errr, she's just nodding her head and blinking her eyelids

O: Ok, keep her as she is

E: Ok

O: What's your mummy's name?

E: Errr Louise

O: Can the ambulance get round the back of your house? Are you at the front or

back?

E: She's at the back. She's starting to talk now.

O: Good, good, just reassure her. Is she able to talk now?

E: Yeah, I think so

O: Can you put the phone to her ear?

E: Ok

Louise [muffled]

O: Hello, can you hear me? It's the ambulance service, love, I think you passed

out.

L: hello, yes [starts to cry]

O: You just stay where you are, we're going to get an ambulance to come and

check you out. I understand you're 37 weeks pregnant [35 weeks as previously

stated is correct]

L: [muffled talking]

O: I can't hear what you're saying

L: [crying] girls, don't cry, mummy;s ok. It's ok girls

O: Don't cry, they've done really well. Do you want to pass me back to your

seven year old? Try not to move.

L: Ok

E: Hello?

O: I'm going to stay with you until the ambulance arrives.

E: They're coming in now, they're coming in the door.

O: Ok. Your name is Evie is that right?

E: Yeah
