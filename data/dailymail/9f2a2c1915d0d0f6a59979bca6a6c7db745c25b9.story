A massive chemical spill in West Virginia has led to multiple hospitalizations and a tap water ban for hundreds of thousands of people.

More than 300,000 people have been left without running water and four have been hospitalized after a potentially toxic foaming agent used in the coal preparation process spilled earlier this week into the Charleston public water system.

Residents were told to not bathe, brush 
their teeth or wash their clothes with tap water after 4-Methylcyclohexane Methanol leaked from a storage tank into the Elk River and the water supply of the mostly rural state's largest city.

A total of 32 people sought treatment at local hospitals after coming down with symptoms of having been poisoned, four of them were admitted for further treatment, a state spokesperson said. Their conditions have not been disclosed.

'We're just not sure exactly how long it's going to take before it's acceptable to lift the do-not-drink ban, West Virgina Gov Earl Tombin told CNN Friday night.

The chemical's concentration in the local water supply was lower Friday, but not to the point officials felt safe allowing people to drink the water again - and Charleston's mayor didn't mince words in voicing his displeasure.

'It's caused us more problems than you could ever imagine,' he told CNN. 'It's a prison from which we would like to be released.'

The ban has forced schools, offices, restaurants, hotels and other businesses to shutter, but hospitals have remained busy.

So far, nearly 700 people have called the
 state's poison control hotline complaining of symptoms of exposure to 
the chemical. Those symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
headaches, skin irritation or rashes.

Federal authorities began investigating how the foaming agent escaped a chemical plant and seeped into the Elk River. Just how much of the chemical leaked into the river was not yet known.

Freedom Industries President Gary Southern has apologized for the toxic spill.

'We'd like to start by sincerely apologizing to the people in the affected counties of West Virginia,' he said. 'We are very, very sorry for the disruptions to everybody's daily life this incident has caused.'

Officials are working with Freedom Industries to determine how much can be in the water without it posing harm to residents, said West Virginia American Water president Jeff McIntyre.

'We don't know that the water's not safe. But I can't say that it is safe,' Mr McIntyre said Friday.

For now, there is no way to treat the tainted water aside from flushing the system until it's in low-enough concentrations to be safe, a process that could take days.

'Yeah, I understand that stuff can happen,' local Jeff Bonham - who also works in the chemical industry - said. 'I don't think it's going to get him out of legal liability. OSHA is the one they're going to have to answer to.'

Officials and experts said the chemical, even in its most concentrated form, isn't deadly.

'We have mitigated the risk, we believe, in terms of further material leaving this facility,' Mr Southern added, acknowledging he had no idea how much of the chemical had leaked out of the storage tank.

President Barack Obama issued an emergency declaration for the state on Friday, ordering federal aid as residents raced to stores to stock up on bags of ice and crates of bottled water.

FEMA is sending 75 trucks - each carrying 18,500 liters of water - were expected to start arriving Friday evening.

The accident unfolded on the Elk River in
 Charleston, West Virginia's capital and largest city, just upriver from
 the state's largest water treatment plant.

It forced Governor Earl Ray Tomblin to 
declare a state of emergency for nine counties as 300,000 residents were left without water.

Health officials have advised residents to use tap water only for flushing toilets and fighting fires.

'West Virginians in the affected 
service areas are urged not to use tap water for drinking, cooking, 
washing or bathing,' Gov. Earl Tomblin said in a statement. 'Right now, our 
priorities are our hospitals, nursing homes and schools.'

A spokesperson with West Virginia American Water told WSAZ they are carrying out water quality testing every hour to figure out the level of concentration in the water.

But she added that the company is unsure how much of the chemical seeped into the water, and said there is no timetable for when the water will be safe to use.

Emergency workers were transporting water to distribution centers in the affected counties, according to the Charleston Gazette.

Following the chemical spill in the Elk River on Thursday, residents have been told not to use tap water for drinking, bathing or cooking, and were warned that boiling it does not remove the chemicals.

The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources said symptoms include: severe burning in throat, severe eye irritation, non-stop vomiting, trouble breathing or severe skin irritation such as skin blistering, WSAZ reported.

The company is unsure how much of the chemical - which is used in the coal preparation process - seeped into the water, and said there is no timetable for when it will be safe to use.

Local media showed pictures of residents lining up at stores for bottled water, and shelves emptied of their supplies.

At a Kroger supermarket in suburban Kanawha City, a Charleston police officer stood guard as shoppers stocked up on bottled water.

'People have been grabbing it like 
crazy,' Kerstin Halstead told the newspaper as she loaded two cases of 
water into her SUV. 'Some people were getting - well, they could have 
shared more.'

Dr.
 Rahul Gupta, health officer for the Kanawha-Charleston and the Putnam 
County Health Departments, ordered the closure of all restaurants and 
schools receiving water from the West Virginia American Water company.

Schools
 would be shut on Friday across many counties, including Boone, Cabell, 
Clay, Jackson, Kanawha, Lincoln, Pocahontas and Putnam, the West 
Virginia Department of Education said on its website.

Concern: Laura John of Charleston also drove across town to South Charleston to find water

Tomblin's spokeswoman, Amy Shuler Goodwin, said she did not know when the ban would be lifted.

The spill originated with Freedom Industries, a Charleston company, according to Laura Jordan, external affairs manager for West Virginia American Water.

It occurred above the intake of the Kanawha Valley water treatment plant in Charleston, which serves 100,000 homes and businesses, or 250,000 to 300,000 people, Ms Jordan said.

'It could be potentially harmful if swallowed and could potentially cause skin and eye irritation,' she added.

The West Virginia Department of Environment Protection got a report of a strange odor on Thursday morning and visited the Freedom Industries site, where they found a leaking storage unit, Shuler Goodwin said.

The company is working with state and federal authorities to get residents access to bottled water, and water distribution sites will be announced through local media, said Ms Jordan.

Freedom Industries' website says it is a producer of specialty chemicals for the mining, steel and cement industries.
