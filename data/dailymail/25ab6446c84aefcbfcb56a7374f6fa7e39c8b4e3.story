An historic building sold as a ruined wreck for just £1 three decades ago is back on the market - with an asking price of £2.3 million. 

The Grade-I listed Barlaston Hall, in Staffordshire, boasts eight bedrooms, five reception rooms and five bathrooms and sits within 4.5 acres of land.

Now the mansion - that was used by the Bank of England during World War Two - is being offered for sale by estate agents Knight Frank.

Barlaston Hall, in Staffordshire, was sold for just £1 in 1981 because it was in a state of decay with rotting floor boards as it had been used for coal mining operations

The Grade-I listed mansion was sold as a dilapidated wreck for £1 just three decades ago, but is now on sale for £2.3 million

By the early 1980s, the hall was in a state of decay, with few repairs for many years and a serious threat of subsidence having been undermined by coal workings. Here is a picture of the dining room before it was restored

The library after its restoration - the renovation of the building is regarded as one of the most significant success stories in English heritage 

The restoration of Barlaston Hall is seen as one of the most significant success stories in English heritage.

It was built by architect Sir Robert Taylor for Thomas Mills in 1756, to replace the existing manor house he had acquired through marriage.   

In 1816, Rosamund Mills married Ralph Adderley and it was lived in by their son, Ralph Thomas Adderley who was a High Sheriff of Staffordshire.

Following his death in 1931, the estate, which then compromised some 380 acres, was put up for sale and bought by the Wedgwood Pottery company in 1937. 

After World War Two, its safety (pictured left) was affected by coal mining operations and the fact it was on a geological fault, which led to severe cracks. It has since been restored (right) and is on the market for £2.3 million

Having acquired the mansion, the company built its factory and a model village for its workforce in its grounds.

During World War Two, it was used by the Bank of England. After the War, it became the Wedgwood Memorial College. 

But it did not stay there for long as dry rot was found in it.

Worse was to come as its safety was compromised by subsidence due to coal mining operations and the fact it was on a geological fault, which led to severe cracks.

Wedgwood left it to decay and at the mercy of vandals.

In 1992, it was bought by its current owners, James and Carol Hall, who restored the interior as it was conceived by architect Sir Robert Taylor when he first designed it

The mansion that was used by the Bank of England during World War Two has five bathrooms and is available to purchase for £2.3 million by estate agents Knight Frank

In a famous coup, SAVE Britain's Heritage, saved the mansion from the Wedgwood pottery company and purchased it for just £1 in 1981

The company twice tried to have the Grade I listed building demolished. 

But in a famous conservation coup, SAVE Britain's Heritage - a group which championed the cause of decaying country houses -  saved the mansion and purchased it for just £1.

The Heritage group was given further grants and a loan, which enabled them to complete the work in the 1990s.

In 1992, it was bought by its current owners, James and Carol Hall, for £300,00 who restored the interior as it was conceived by architect Sir Robert Taylor when he first designed it. The complete restoration, with the help of the English Heritage, took five years to complete. 

They now hope the new owners will retain the hall's charms.  

The mansion sits beside the old church of St John the Baptist, which has a medieval tower and churchyard. 

It has been deconsecrated and is under different ownership from the hall. It can be purchased separately.

The property stands on a wooded ridge above the valley of the Trent between the canal market town of Stone and just five-and-a-half miles from Stoke-on-Trent. 

Estate agent George Dennis, said: 'This house is a one-off in that Grade-I listed buildings don't come on the market very often. The building is a fine piece of architecture and the current owners have put a lot of money into the restoration. 

'The reason why the owners are selling is because they are looking to move back to Scotland. It has been a home to them and this building is best suited for that purpose.'  

The Grade-I listed mansion was bought by the Wedgwood Pottery company in 1937 as a site to replace its operation a few miles away in an industrial part of Stoke-on-Trent.

A new electric pottery and model village was built for its employees in the grounds.

During the Second World War, it was used by the Bank of England because it was deemed to be structurally safe. 

From 1945, the hall housed the Wedgwood Memorial College, but when the building was found to contain dry rot, they left and moved elsewhere in the village. 

Wedgwood continued to maintain the Hall until the late 1960s.

By the early 1980s, the hall was in a state of decay, with few repairs for many years. 

Wedgwood made two applications to have the building demolished. 

But SAVE Britain's Heritage preserved the mansion and purchased it for just £1 in 1981.
