'The Black Amish': Alan Beiler, 35, was born in Brooklyn, New York, but adopted by an Amish family and speaks the Pennsylvania Dutch language

A star of the quasi-reality TV show 'Amish Mafia' has been sentenced to up to two years in prison for drug possession and leading police on a high-speed chase last year that resulted in a Pennsylvania State Trooper being injured.

Alan Beiler, who calls himself 'the black Amish,' is an actor and producer of the popular Discovery Channel show about the supposed 'dark underbelly' of the Amish community in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

In July 2012, five months before 'Amish Mafia' debuted, a Pennsylvania State Trooper tried to pull Beiler over for having an expired registration on his 2004 Jeep Liberty.

Instead of stopping, Beiler accelerated and began driving in the oncoming traffic lane. 

Police
 say he nearly rammed into five cars along the way. The chase ended when
 the trooper crashed his squad car and suffered a mild concussion, the Harrisburg Patriot-News reports.

State troopers later tracked Beiler, 35, back to his house by using his license plate number.

A
 search of his SUV revealed marijuana and a trove of pills, including 
Carisoprodol, a muscle relaxer, oxycodone and Alprazolam, an 
anti-anxiety medication.

The Discovery Channel show purports to show the 'dark underbelly' of the Amish community - though there are disputes over whether the show is actually 'reality' TV

Beiler was raised by an Amish family and claims to work as an intermediary between the insular community and the outside world

Beiler
 was seldom seen on the first season of 'Amish Mafia.' He was billed as 
the event planner, who brought hundreds of young Amish and Mennonites 
together for large - profitable - events.

Beiler
 is black and was born in Brooklyn, New York, but his mother moved him 
the heart of the Amish community in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, when
 he was a small boy.

There, he was adopted by an Amish family and learned the customs of the Amish and crucially, the Pennsylvania Dutch language.

On his personal websites, Beiler bills himself as a go-between for the Amish and the non-Amish (English) communities.

As a large black man with tattoos, cornrows and a penchant for self-promotion, Beiler stands out.

Beiler says he has cleaned himself up and turned his life around since the arrest last summer

But, he claims, his deep ties to the Amish community and his knowledge of the language wins over the trust of even the strictest Old Order Amish. 

Beiler told a judge on Thursday that he was a 'better person and a new man' than he was when he fled from police.

He said he has not used drugs since his July arrest and has worked to clean up his life.

Perry County Judge Kevin A. Mummah agreed that Beiler had turned his life around, but said he needed to pay the price for his crimes.

H sentenced the TV star to serve between three and 23 months in prison.
