A seven-year-old boy took a loaded 9mm handgun into school in his waistband and showed it off to classmates.

School chiefs in Pasadena, Texas, said it was the youngest child they had ever found with a firearm - adding it was a miracle the gun, which had the safety catch off, was not fired.

The incident unfolded just after 9am on Monday at Kruse Elementary School when a young girl saw the gun and alerted her teacher.

School district spokesman Renea Ivy told Fox 26 News: 'We're fortunate that gun was not discharged - to think about the alternative is terrible'. The pupil was suspended from school and police were called

Staff took the boy, who has not been named, out of the classroom and immediately called police.

They discovered he had found the gun in his home and taken it into school concealed in his clothes.

Renea Ivy, spokesman for the Pasadena Independent School District, told Fox 26 News: 'It was [loaded], which is upsetting to everyone. That is scary to think that a first grade child could have a loaded gun.

'We're really thankful that the little girl told her teacher.

'We're fortunate that gun was not discharged - to think about the alternative is terrible and that's why we're back at the table saying are we doing enough to make sure our students are safe.

The gun was found in the city of Pasadena, which is on the outskirts of the U.S.'s fourth-largest city Houston

'Part of that responsibility is ours 
as adults, not only to secure our weapons but also to tell children if 
you see a gun, don't touch it.'

The boy was disciplined and suspended from 
school, while his parents received a citation for making a firearm 
accessible to a child, Houston news network KHOU reported.

A letter sent to parents said: 'Guns are not allowed at school. More importantly, please take this incident as an opportunity to talk to your child about gun safety.

'If you have a gun in your home, please secure the gun in a place that children cannot access and make sure the gun is not loaded and has a safety feature that must be removed before the weapon can be discharged.

'Whether or not you have a gun in your house, remind students that if they see a gun, they should not touch it and should immediately tell an adult.'
