Deadly partying: Kinara Patel, 18, died after a drinking binge that began and ended in a Villanova University dorm room

Police are piecing together the ‘mystery’ night two months ago that ended a teenager’s life after she drank too much alcohol while partying.

Kinara Patel, 18, of Hackensack, New Jersey, was found dead in a dorm room at around 10am on August 29, just three days after she returned from summer vacation to start her sophomore year at Villanova University, Philadelphia.

Patel’s drinking binge began in Sullivan Hall, one of the largest dorms on campus which houses 400 students.

She then continued the night with friends at Maloney’s Pub in Bryn Mawr, which is known for allowing minors into the premises.

Patel and other students went back to the dorm afterwards and continued drinking there.

She was found dead at 9.50am the next morning. The Delaware County medical examiner said she died of acute alcohol poisoning, according to Philly.com.

Police say they do not know much Patel drank at Maloney’, and according to friends and a cabdriver who took the students back to Villanova, she didn't appear drunk.

‘She should have been staggering, and she wasn't,’ Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan said. In fact, he said, the friend who was with her ‘was in worse shape’.

Dead: She was found unresponsive at around 10am on August 29 in a dorm room in Sullivan Hall, which houses 400 students

Authorities have not released her blood-alcohol content, but the autopsy report says the 5-foot-2 Patel ingested a lethal quantity of ethanol.

‘How she consumed that much alcohol remains a mystery,’ Whelan said, adding that no criminal charges would be brought in connection with her death.

Patel had used a fake driver's license to get into Maloney's, a Villanova hangout, according to police. She was there from midnight to 2am.

The bar has a history of serving minors, according to authorities.

Lower Merion police arrested people for underage drinking or providing false IDs in November 2012, February 2013, and September 2013, police Capt. William Boegley said.

The state police Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement cited the bar in June 2012 and July 2013 for serving underage drinkers.

On August 26, three days before Patel died, an age-compliance check was conducted at the bar and a minor was turned away, spokesman Trooper Adam Reed said.

‘All the Villanova students, they're at the bars and they've got very good IDs out there now,’ Boegley said.

Colarulo, the Radnor superintendent, said Patel had a ‘very authentic-looking’ driver's license.

Villanova has said it provides several alcohol-education programs for students, but has not made any changes on campus following Patel's death.

Its student code of conduct outlines sanctions for underage drinking, although like many universities, the school has a medical amnesty policy, spokesman Jonathan Gust said.

‘The loss of even one student is too many. To lose someone so young is heartbreaking, and Kinara Patel's death was a tremendous loss for the entire Villanova community,’ he said.

Tragic: Three days after returning to Villanova University in August for her sophomore year as a business major, the 18-year-old from Hackensack, New Jersey, was found dead in a dorm room after a night of heavy drinking

Good person: Patel organised the Bergen County Academies' first Relay for Life cancer walk, now an annual event

Patel, a business major, was a former prep-school student described as warm and caring and with a smile ‘as wide as the sky’, according to Philly.com.

Her principal at Bergen County Academies in New Jersey said she organised the school's first Relay for Life cancer walk, now an annual event.

On October 5, Lower Merion police cited 75 people for underage drinking at an apartment building at 801 Montgomery Ave. Almost all attended the university, Boegley said.

Villanova is looking to build several dorms on campus to curb some of the rowdiness of students who live in surrounding communities.
