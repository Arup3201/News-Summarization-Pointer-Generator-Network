Milton Keynes Dons will hosts AFC Wimbledon in the first round of the Capital One Cup.

The grudge match will be the second time the two rivals have met since Wimbledon moved 54 miles to Milton Keynes in 2003 and AFC Wimbledon were formed in protest.

Their previous meeting saw the MK Dons triumph 2-1 in an FA Cup second round game.
