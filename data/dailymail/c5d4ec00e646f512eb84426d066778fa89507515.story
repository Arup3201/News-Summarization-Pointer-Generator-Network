The parents of the 34-year-old Lindt café manager who was taken hostage and killed during the 16-hour siege in Sydney have paid tribute to their ‘beautiful boy’.

Tori Johnson, who was working at the café in Martin Place on Monday when self-described radical cleric Man Haron Monis stormed the building with a gun, has been hailed a hero after details emerged of how he tried to overpower the gunman to protect his staff and customers.

Mr Johnson’s parents Ken and Rowena said, in a statement via radio host Ben Fordham: ‘We are so proud of our beautiful boy Tori, gone from this earth but forever in our memories as the most amazing life partner, son and brother we could ever wish for.’

The devastated family said they ‘feel heartfelt sorrow for the family of Katrina Dawson’, a 38-year-old mother of three and the second victim of the siege. 

Tori Johnson worked as a manager at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, central Sydney, for two years 

‘We'd like to thank not only our friends and loved ones for their support, but the people of Sydney; Australia and those around the world for reaching out with their thoughts and prayers,’ they said. 

‘Our deepest gratitude to the NSW police, armed forces and paramedics for their tireless efforts.

‘We ask that the media respects our privacy in this difficult time. Let us all pray for peace on earth.’

Meanwhile, Mr Johnson’s former boss at Adria restaurant in Sydney’s Darling Harbour, Peter Manettas, told Daily Mail Australia that he was ‘one of the most selfless men I ever met’.

‘He was the kind of person to put his staff before himself every day of the week, he was an extraordinary and hospitable leader and we are all deeply saddened,’ Mr Manettas said.

Asked whether he was surprised at reports that Mr Johnson may have tried to wrestle the gunman to help others to safety, Mr Manettas said: ‘He was a leader… he was a leader in every aspect of the word.’

Mr Johnson's brave actions reportedly prompted police to storm the cafe with assault rifles and stun grenades as the 16-hour siege was ended 

After Mr Johnson left his role as restaurant manager at Adria and began working at the Lindt café in October 2012, he stayed in touch with his former colleagues.

‘We’re a family run company and everyone who works with us is a part of that family. We still had a lot of contact with Tori after he left and he gave them advice and taught them things in every aspect of what he did,’ he said.

Mr Manettas explained Mr Johnson was from a close family: ‘I know how much his family meant to him and a day wouldn’t go by when he didn’t talk about them and their achievements.

‘He was a very proud man.’

Friend of Tori Johnson, Genevieve Collier, wrote a tribute to her former colleague on Facebook

A friend and former colleague, Genevieve Collier, wrote on Facebook: 'R.I.P Tori Johnson, at times we both hated each other, and at other times we'd be hysterically laughing. 

'You gave me so many chances even when I was a little s**t eating all the lindor balls and pretending I was a barista. You had a good heart, and I knew you were in there protecting everyone.' 

Mr Johnson's brave actions reportedly prompted police to storm the cafe with assault rifles and stun grenades.

But the 34-year-old man paid with his own life as Monis, 50, turned a shotgun on him and fired.

Monis was also shot dead after police burst into the Martin Place cafe at 2.11am Tuesday and opened fire.

It has emerged the gunman was a self-styled sheik from Iran who arrived in Australia in 1996 and was on bail for being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, allegedly carried out by his current partner.

Monis also faced 40 charges of indecent and sexual assault during his time as a 'spiritual healer' and has appeared in court for sending hate-filled letters to the families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan.

Also killed in the siege was barrister and mother of three, Katrina Dawson, 38, who worked in legal chambers opposite the café.
