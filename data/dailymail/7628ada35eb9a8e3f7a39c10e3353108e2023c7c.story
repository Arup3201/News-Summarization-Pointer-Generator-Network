When it comes to having a baby gender equality doesn’t really enter into it. Carrying, delivering and breastfeeding a little one is a woman’s job. It’s a massive undertaking that pushes many of us to our limits.

Therefore, Men, this gift guide is for you.

If you are a husband, or partner to a woman who has carried, loved, soothed and nurtured your child this year – this list is designed with you in mind.  

Ashley says that this Mother's Day, it is just as important for the father to get a gift for the mother as it is the children

Mother’s Day is a great opportunity to show some real appreciation.

A few rules to remember:

1) Lingerie, unless it’s very comfortable, may be viewed as a gift for YOU not for her.

2) Weight loss tools or cleaning implements are never acceptable. I don’t care what that hoover can do. Walk away.

3) Unless she really adores cooking - don’t even think about kitchen appliances.

4) Alcohol is always welcome.

And most importantly:

5)  Run Don’t Walk from all the ‘Mumsy’ stuff out there; twee pink flowers, pink gingham and baby birds on everything. Just because she’s a mother doesn’t mean she’s lost her mind. 

SKINCARE:

Fancy Face creams are a splurge. And as long as it doesn’t say anything about wrinkles on the jar, it is always appreciated.

ARK salon has a new moisturiser that 
smells of fresh flowers. It’s made with Alpine Rose from the Swiss Alps 
which contains resistance-charged stem cells, helping regenerate cells. 
Smells lovely and feels delightful. www.arkskincare.com

Moisturiser Net-45 from LM is a 
favourite of Lilly Allen and Emma Thompson. Beta Glucan, sweet Almond 
and Avacado Oil as well as oils of Lime & Orange make this dream 
cream pretty awesome. From £45  www.lindameredith.com

(Left) Jo Loves Bath Perfume. Brand new 
offering from the perfume-ista which combines cologne and bath oil. 
Luxury bathing personified. Try the Shot of Sweet Peas. £59 www.joloves.com (Right) Aromatherapy Associates Revive Morning 
Bath and Shower Oil. Great brand with fantastic smelling products; this
 oil is a beautiful gift for anyone sleep deprived.  www.aromatherapyassociates.com £39

FLOWERS:

Blooms don’t have to be pricey. There 
are lovely two stem Mother’s Day Orchids available from B&Q for £10.
 They are bursting with colour and include the pot.

If you decide to go the traditional 
route, Galton Flowers, a London based florist, will ship anywhere in the
 UK. They have some drop dead gorgeous bouquets for Mother’s Day at 
around a £60 www.galtonflowers.com

SCENT:

(Left) If she likes visiting New York and there
 is more than one item of pink in her wardrobe, try Marc Jacobs’ new 
perfume Daisy Eau So Fresh. A twist on the original it has notes of 
blood orange, raspberry and velvety apricot. Smells like spring in a 
bottle. £49.50 www.theperfumeshop.com                                                                                        (Right)  If she’s a fan of Jo Malone I recommend 
 their new Vanilla & Anise Cologne. It’s a modern take on vanilla – 
chic without the over-sweet. There’s an oaky, almost vanilla bourbon 
smell which I love. £39 www.houseoffraser.co.uk

JUST PLAIN PRETTY:

Bobbi Brown - kind of a given that she 
likes this beauty brand. Even Kate Middleton refused to be wrestled 
from her BB make-up on her wedding day. Just launched in an Uber-Pink 
make-up collection and everything feels like spring Try one of each. Lip
 sticks and glosses start at £18 www.bobbibrown.co.uk

Bronnley has had a makeover and just 
launched a gorgeous, and very affordable ‘Citrus’ Collection.  Hand wash
 and hand lotion combis, zesty shower gels and body lotions.  I love the
 Lime & Bergamot which is fresh and bright with notes of grapefruit.
 From £10 available on Ocado.com and www.bronnley.co.uk

SWEET:

If there is a better cupcake in the 
world, I’ve yet to find it.  Hummingbird Bakery has a great selection of
 sweet treats for Mother’s Day.  Hint: If she has a sweet tooth - you 
can’t go wrong with red velvet.  www.hummingbirdbakery.com 

A great gift for chocolate/wine lovers 
(like basically everyone): Chocolate heroes Green & Black's has a 
Tasting Collection with a choice of Chardonnay or Merlot. £26 at www.greenandblacksdirect.com

UK favourite Thorntons has a sweet 
Mother’s Day Gift Collection with caramel & chocolate hearts and I 
Love Mum Cups. Comes with lovely gift wrap. From £26 www.thorntons.co.uk

TREAT HER LIKE AN A-LISTER:

Skin care expert Linda Meredith is a 
Knightsbridge based facialist who works on some of the world’s most 
famous mums including Gwyneth Paltrow, Penelope Cruz and Julia Roberts. 
Her signature treatment is her Haute Couture & Oxygen Facial. For 
Mother's Day, Linda is offering a 50% discount on the celebrity 
favourite. It’s £75 for a one hour treatment and available until April 
20th. Appointments@lindameredith.com

IN THE NO NEED TO EXPLAIN CATEGORY:

 (Left) If you really want to wow her. Veuve 
Clicquot has put together a gift of Rose champagne with glass flutes in 
probably the prettiest pink box I’ve ever seen. Utterly fabulous - a 
truly amazing gift. £73.50 from  urban-drinks.co.uk and Selfridges.com (Right) Great Western Wines have a lovely 
Champagne brand new to the UK. Apparently, the nose is dominated by 
brioches and patisserie aromas. Works for me. Champagne Jacquart Demi 
Sec NV, £35 www.greatwesternwine.co.uk

THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX:

Take her away for a night away sans baby
 - but not so far that she might feel panicked.  London’s Cannizaro 
House is a gorgeous, country house style hotel that feels like you’ve 
arrived at Downton Abbey – and it’s just off the District Line. £225.00
 for a lovely room including dinner in the elegant restaurant for two. www.cannizarohouse.com

(Left) Go for a Soda Stream if your wife loves 
her sparking bevvies, in addition to majorly helping the environment, I 
love the fact that their diet drinks are sweetened with Stevia not 
aspartame and their products generally have one-third of the sugar, 
calories, and carbohydrates of their rival store-bought brands. Bonus: 
you can make great cocktails with it too.  On sale now for £39.99 at www.sodastream.co.uk                                                       (Right) A recent study showed that most women 
wanted a juicer for Valentine’s Day over roses and chocolate. If you 
missed the boat in February, it’s not too late now. Get the 
Nutri-Bullet. This was a huge sell-out in the States and just made its 
way across the pond. I won’t bore you with the technical stuff but it’s 
hard core. It bursts open seeds, cracks stems, and shreds skins – no 
peeling needed. It’s also easy to clean which is a big yes. £99.99 www.buynutribullet.co.uk

If you decide to give mum a present from
 baby consider upgrading her ride. So if your lady love is wielding a 
pushchair that has seen better days, consider the stunning new Urbo 2 
from Mamas and Papas. It rides like a dream and by the way looks 
extremely smart. £449 at www.mamasandpapas.com
