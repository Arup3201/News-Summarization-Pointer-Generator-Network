Tragic: Jake Milton, 17, was stabbed to death on Friday night

A family have paid tribute to a teenager who was stabbed to death in a Bristol street.

Jake Milton, 17, was attacked on Friday night in the Knowle area of the city.

Two men - aged 18 and 19 - have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in police custody.

Grieving friends and family gathered to lay floral tributes to the 'happy and smiling' lad in the Bristol street where the incident took place.

A card pinned to flowers from sister 
Shan said: 'You didn't deserve this. You were an amazing brother and you
always put a smile on my face.'

One woman, who did not want to be named, hung a school uniform shirt which carried the emblem of Jake's first school - Holy Cross Catholic Primary - above the flowers, next to a Manchester United shirt which was also left in tribute at the scene.

'He went to school with my boys,' she said, fighting back tears.

'He was only just 17 in November and was just a normal kid really.

'Everyone goes through stages in their life, but he was a good lad and always smiling.

'It's so sad. I can't believe it.'

Around 30 floral tributes lay off Cossington Road in Knowle, where police were called at around 11.20pm on Friday night.

'Jake you was loved by so many people, people respected you, you was a great laugh and had the funniest personality going.

'This has been so hard for everyone, hearing and waking up to news that such a horrible thing has happened.

'You were my cousin that always looked after me and everyone else, it's so sad writing this. Everyone keep strong, Jake wouldn't want us all to be upset.'

Sister Keira Lee wrote: 'You wasn't just a brother you was like a best friend.
