She may be pregnant with her second baby but Una Foden won't have to worry about shifting her baby weight next year.

The 33-year-old star of The Saturdays reveals that she's been following a healthy diet and exercise regime over the last few months and she's even been snapped up by Reebok to model the sporty brand's latest range.

Posing in a series of promotional images before she announced her baby news, Una shows off her trim and toned figure in her second campaign for the athletic apparel brand.

Trim star: The Saturdays singer Una Foden is currently modelling Reebok's latest range of women's athletic apparel and while the campaign was shot before her pregnancy was announced, the healthy star will no doubt have no trouble slipping back into her pre-baby figure

'It's great to be back for a second time around,' Una told MailOnline. And with her passion for health and fitness, it seems she's a perfect fit. 

'I've just come off tour with The Saturdays and I was very, very fit in preparation. We were dancing all day every day and had an hour and a half on stage,' she said.

Sporty star: The 33-year-old, who recently announced she's expecting her second baby with husband Ben Foden, follows a healthy lifestyle and loves working out and whizzing up healthy vegetable juices at home 

Shaping up: Now that she's pregnant, Una has been doing less strenuous activities such as walking and swimming to keep her healthy

'However, my approach to fitness during my pregnancy has been very different and not as strenuous. I've been doing lots of walking and swimming and I'd love to give yoga a go as it looks amazing.'

As well as a committed exercise regime, Una follows a balanced diet but proving that she's just like the rest of us, she allows herself treats, too.

'I eat very healthily and I love using my juicer to whiz up fruit and vegetable juices.

'As for treats, I don't have a sweet tooth, I'm more of a savoury person and love salty foods. At home, Sunday is takeaway day and we have Indian, pizza or Chinese. Obviously I don't eat as much as Ben,' she said of her England rugby star husband.

Beauty secrets: To maintain her glossy hair, Una's secret won't break the bank - she swears by Garnier Ultimate Blends' £2.99 The Sleek Restorer Intensive 1 Minute Treatment

As well as showcasing a honed physique, Una's good looks have been well documented since her ascent to fame with the girl band, but the singer claims she didn't even know how to apply false eyelashes before joining The Saturdays.

'We are constantly in hair and makeup with the band and we are always exchanging beauty tips,' she said. 'I couldn't even apply false eyelashes before I joined but now, thanks to all the tips I've learnt from makeup artists, I can do my own makeup to a high standard.'

While she admits she never leaves the house without base and mascara (because she feels 'naked' without it), after a long day on stage, Una loves nothing more than coming home and taking the day off. 'I have a simple skincare regime, just cleanse, tone and moisturise and my secret to good skin is plenty of water and sleep.

Mentor: Una is currently in Ireland filming The Voice, where she will mentor the singing hopefuls alongside Rachel Stevens 

'I come home and can't wait to take my make-up off after we've been on tour and just be natural, I've been loving Clinique's Sonic System Purifying Cleansing Brush - it leaves my skin feeling amazing,' she said. 

As for her glossy hair, beauty aficionados will be pleased to hear that Una's secret won't break the bank - she swears by Garnier Ultimate Blends' £2.99 The Sleek Restorer Intensive 1 Minute Treatment, which, she says, is amazing for coloured hair like hers. 

Stylewise, the mother-of-one says she loves getting dressed up for a night out but loves to chill out in comfy clothes when she's at home - and is a rock chic at heart.

She said: 'I love dressing rocky when I'm not on stage with The Saturdays. I love skinny jeans, a leather jacket and boots - a bit Kate Moss. I also love the boho look so I'd say my ideal style is somewhere between Miranda Kerr and Nicole Richie.' 

As well as being pregnant with a baby boy, The Saturdays star, who already has a two-year-old daughter Aoife Belle with her rugby player husband, is set to appear as a coach on Ireland's The Voice.

'I can't wait to be a mentor,' she said. 'We are there to find some real talent so I can't wait to get stuck in,' she said.
