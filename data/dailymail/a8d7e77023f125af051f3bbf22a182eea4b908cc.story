A Texas couple burned down their vacant luxury home teetering atop a crumbling 75-foot cliff over a Central Texas lake on Friday.

The 4,000-square-foot house overlooks Lake Whitney, about 60 miles south of Fort Worth.

The house has been condemned and owners Denise and Robert Webb evacuated the property about two weeks ago. Chunks of the cliff — and the $700,000 home — have been tumbling into the water.

Getting ready: A team prepares to burn down the home

Going in: A crane was seen moving into the home's garage

Workers were seen on camera preparing 
for the house's destruction. A crane was filmed going into the home's 
garage, and two workers were later seen on top of the crane smashing the
 home's windows in.

Some time later, they were seen back inside the garage, ripping off parts of it. Hay was also seen placed inside the garage to aid with the fire's spread. 

Homeowners Denise and Robert Webb spoke to WTSP about the decision to burn down their home.

'It's gone. It's just gone,' Denise Webb said. 'And you don't see how something that huge can just disintegrate right in front of your face.'

'It's, it's really tough -- that house was special and I don't even know why it was so special but ti was special to me,' she also said.

Smash: Construction workers soon moved the crane up to the home's windows

Smashed: The home's front windows were destroyed by the workers before the scheduled fire

'You know, that's my life there that 
we're watching fall off,' Robert Webb told the station. 'Until you see 
it... sitting with what was your yard, gone. The deck that you used to sit 
on a chair and look at the lake. Uh you know, it's gone.'

'I wanted to leave that to my grandchildren. It's a big hit,' he added.

The Webbs told WTSP that they bought the home 'in good faith' and were told it was habitable.

On the property's lawn a stone arrangement from above read 'We [heart] Nana + Papa.'

More work: The crane was seen again in the massive home's garage

Going in: Parts of the garage were filmed being torn down

Tom Hemrick, Hill County's emergency 
management coordinator, says the Webbs decided to burn the house to its 
slab foundation after consulting with demolition experts and the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers.

Hemrick says the Webbs will have the charred debris moved to stable land and crews will remove the slab.

The residence was built in 2007.

Destroyed: A message for Denise and Robert Webb was seen on the day of the fire

Ignited: The crew workers are seen lighting the garage on fire

The flames quickly take hold of the garage

Destruction: The house is seen engulfed in flames

Workers
 were seen throwing sparks into the garage and it quickly became 
engulfed in flames. The fire soon spread to the back of the house. Parts
 of the home were seen falling off of the high cliff and down to the bottom.

That debris started a smaller fire on the ground, as a large black tower of smoke rose from the destroyed home.

Soon, the fire burned enough of the house down to reveal its interior structure. 

Over several hours, the roof, followed by the second and first floors, fell apart. Gradually the first-floor walls fell apart, leaving behind only charred remains.

After the fire was nearly finished, leaving just a trail of smoke, onlookers were seen walking near the structure, examining the former luxury home.
