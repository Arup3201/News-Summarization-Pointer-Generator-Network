'She implores you to love, love, love her': Susanna Reid is pictured on Good Morning Britain yesterday

Former BBC Breakfast star Susanna Reid made her debut on ITV’s rival Good Morning Britain yesterday.

The show, which replaces the struggling Daybreak, has been modelled on Good Morning America and opened with ex-Strictly Come Dancing contestant Miss Reid and co-hosts Ben Shephard, Charlotte Hawkins and Sean Fletcher seated at a glass desk.

Here, JAN MOIR gives her verdict on ITV’s latest bid to win back early morning viewers.

Susanna Reid is the marquee name launching ITV’s new breakfast programme Good Morning Britain. For two-and-a-half hours on the debut show, Susanna gives it all she’s got – and then some.

She talks, she walks from desk to sofa to chair and back again, this time without the aid of a choreographer.

She grills politicians, she giggles with guests, she pours herself down the camera and wills you, begs you, implores you to love, love, love her as much as she loves herself. 

If you thought her cha cha on the last series of Strictly Come Dancing was effortful, just watch Susanna try to win over the breakfast nation – and sparkle at dawn without the aid of sequins.Oof, there were times when it was painful viewing. 

‘Have you got that Monday morning feeling, as you manage to drag yourself into the kitchen and the bathroom?’ she asks at one point. No, Susanna, but it is creeping up on me.

Good Morning Britain has a logo in the form of a yellow teardrop – a terrible omen? – and signs which flash onscreen to let viewers know what is going on. Every now and again there is a DEVELOPING STORY or something that is NEW THIS MORNING.

Top stories include an item about a family with 16 children and some footage of pop group One Direction, which is relentlessly plugged.

Susanna is rather off beam when talking from the studio to the mother of the 16 children, admitting that she has a problem remembering the names of her own three boys.

Really? That’s awkward.

Debut shows are invariably clumsy, but this one was more glitch-ridden and clenched than most.

Cues were missed, while presenters talked over each other as if they were trying to impress at a speed dating night. You could sniff the shredded nerve ends and collective anxiety, as potent as frying bacon, crisping in the air. 

In the ITV studios, Susanna is the leader of a quartet of chummy broadcasters; each of them resplendent in plasticated high-def make up, super-bouncy blow dries and regulation neon dentistry. 

During the very first minutes of the very first episode of Good Morning Britain, a chirpy weathergirl regretfully informs viewers that the outlook is Dull, Misty, Murky and Foggy.

Soon
 after Good Morning Britain began at 6am yesterday viewers took to 
Twitter to ask why they were not able to see more of Miss Reid, who was 
poached from the BBC on a salary of around £400,000.

One
 commented: ‘Why has ITV paid so much for Susanna Reid only to put her 
behind a desk? It’s like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage.’

Another asked: ‘How many thousands of people turn back to BBC after Susanna Reid has a desk spoiling view of her legs?’

A
 third said: ‘Good Morning Britain they have Susanna Reid behind a 
desk!! Really the best legs in the country stuck behind a desk!’

No
 doubt to their relief, after ten minutes she stepped from behind the 
desk and moved to a chair for an interview about changes to benefits.

There
 were also tweets in praise of co-host Charlotte Hawkins, poached from 
Sky, with one calling her ‘the only one who doesn’t seem nervous’.

OK. Now that we’ve got the nicknames for the new presenters out of the way, can we get on with the show?

So it’s anchors away, with Charlotte Hawkins, Ben Shephard and mandatory sports dude Sean Fletcher; all of them crowded with Susanna behind a glass desk. Is it a panel show, is it a game show – or is Simon Cowell going to appear at any minute and press his red buzzer? I do hope not. 

The guest for their first show is ‘legendary chat show host Paul O’Grady’, which is hardly a scoop as the old boy is rarely off the network. Susanna informs us that he is going to be talking about  his most recent heart attack. Oh that’s nice.

Behind the presenters, there is a view of the sparkling Thames and St Paul’s Cathedral, basking in the sunshine under a clear blue sky. 

Ominously, this is a fake view, which only adds to the sense of fraught claustrophobia. In reality it is a grey and damp morning in London, as confirmed by the weathergirl, who is annoying me already. 

‘You can find out what April showers are by checking out my blog,’ she says. Don’t mind if I don’t, luv. However, if you happen to be the only over-five in the entire United Kingdom who doesn’t know what rain is, go right ahead.

ITV are pinning all their hopes on Susanna, the former BBC Breakfast presenter who gained much apparent popularity after Strictly. Yet while lots of men love Susanna’s obvious charms, I have always felt that women find her flinty, head girl persona a little more resistible. Can she really deliver the audiences that ITV crave?

Yesterday she wore an elegant red dress, with cape sleeves. Weirdly, she keeps her left elbow aloft for most of the programme, presumably to show off the drape of the cape.

No matter, I think red is her signature colour in the way that yellow is a queen bee’s signature colour or brown is favoured by the dung beetle. It’s just so her! 

Reading matter: Former BBC Breakfast star Miss Reid makes an early arrival at the ITV studios for her first day

Susanna has said she really wants to connect with ITV viewers, and makes a big breakfast effort to do this. 

Sometimes she does her Happy Face, sometimes, when broadcasting serious news items, she does her Concerned Face, but quite a few times on the launch edition of Good Morning Britain the mask slips and she does her Annoyed Face instead. Especially when she makes a mistake and blames others. 

‘Someone is putting extra words in my head,’ she snaps when she fluffs a line. Then she gets all ‘discombobulated’ and can’t hide a flash of bad temper when she misreads the autocue. Ooooh, my diva antenna are twitching like worms at the spectacle of a star being quick to blame others during a live broadcast. 

And all this on a breakfast television show! I shudder to think what Susanna would be like if she was a big Hollywood star and someone didn’t peel her avocados or steam press her flesh-coloured tights in her Winnebago. Frightening!

Tragically, Hollywood reporter and Daybreak leftover Ross King is still there – a man who has the colour and charm of a burnt pasty. Hey Ross, what’s the latest on the George Clooney getting married story? ‘No official confirmation, but then again, no official denial either,’ says Ross. 

Back in the studio, Susanna thinks the wedding will be a ‘pretty incredible affair’.

‘Sizeable,’ ventures Ben.

Paul O’Grady is still in the hospitality room. ‘I’m nodding off here,’ he says, rather disobligingly. Still, he spoke for us all.

Back in the studio, you could cut the fake bonhomie with a plastic picnic knife. ‘That’s chemistry,’ says Susanna, as she and Ben talk over each other yet again. Fake laughter echoes around the studio, from those off as well as onscreen as if they were attending a lovely party. The Americanisation of the British breakfast show seems complete. 

Susanna ends the first show sitting on the cream sofa with Paul O’Grady, who sends viewers home happy with his tales of coronary failure and pet chemotherapy.

The last word comes from Blogging Weather Girl. ‘This is not the best start to the day,’ she says, pointing to a dull front moving in. 

Quite.
