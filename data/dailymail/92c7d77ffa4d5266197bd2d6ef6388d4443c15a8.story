Nothing gets between President Obama and his love of fast food after he nipped out of the White House for a second-day running to satisfy his cravings.

The President was accompanied by his education secretary Arne Duncan for an unannounced lunch on Tuesday at FireFlies Restaurant in Alexandria, Virginia.

Obama went to the burger joint after owner Mary Lisa Lichens wrote to him earlier this year toÂ  explain how the government shutdown in October had affected her small business. She had asked him to stop by some time and try the best burger around.

Obama took her up on that offer on Tuesday and said after lunch that he was 'very 
happy' with his order of American burger, fries and sweet tea. Secretary Duncan 
ordered the same food with a Diet Coke to drink.

FireFlies staff member Gregg Sanders told MailOnline today that they had no warning the President was stopping by with Mr Duncan and his Secret Service entourage.

Mr Sanders said: 'It got very hectic and lots of people poured in to see him but he was very laid back and pretty chill. He made everyone feel at ease around him.'

Owner Ms Lichens was unable to make it to the restaurant in time for Obama's visit, so the President called her on the phone.

The owner wasn't in today, but the President phoned her to say how much he enjoyed his burger

Mr Sanders said: 'He called her on the phone from the restaurant so that she had the opportunity to talk to him. He thanked her for a great burger.'

Server Dawn Sanders also told MailOnline that the President left his server, Anthony, a big tip.

She added: 'He just popped in. There was a lot of commotion but he greeted all the customers and was very nice.'

Burger runs are becoming somewhat of a regular thing for Obama. Last month, he and Vice President Joe Biden surprised diners at a Shake Shack burger restaurant in Dupont Circle in the capital.

But his recent, unscheduled outings are hardly
 limited to just getting a burger. Obama left the White House on foot on
 Monday and went to a nearby Starbucks with his chief of staff.

The President managed to shirk a knot of reporters who normally accompany him when he leaves the White House grounds.

Obama and chief of staff Denis McDonough left the White House for a mid-afternoon coffee pick-me-up.

Upon learning that Obama was on the move, White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri attempted to mobilize reporters to a nearby Dunkin Donuts, apparently the shop Obama and McDonough initially planned to visit.

Instead, the two headed for Starbucks, avoiding most reporters.

Palmieri said that before leaving Obama patted her on the back and said, quote: 'The bear's loose,' referring to himself.
