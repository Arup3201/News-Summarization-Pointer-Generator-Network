A mature student has been kicked out of university after describing his female teacher as ‘tall, blonde, stacked, smart and articulate’ in an essay.

Joseph Corlett, 56, is fuming after Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, kicked him off the writing and rhetoric course and the campus.

The countertop refinisher based the assignment about Pamela Mitzelfeld, 49, on the 1984 song Hot for Teacher by rock band Van Halen.

‘The real issue is the First Amendment,’ Mr Corlett, of Lake Orion, Michigan, said. ‘It's about academic freedom and about due process.

‘I asked her on multiple occasions if there were topical restrictions on the day books - and on every occasion she told me no,’ he told ABC News.

His case was taken up by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education after he was banned from campus and told to undergo counselling.

The journal in which he wrote the piece was labelled as a ‘place for a writer to try out ideas and record impressions and observations’.

The idea was that uncensored writings and
 thoughts in the journal, which he handed in November, could be used to 
create proper essays.

He compared one teacher in another entry to Ginger Grant, a character played by actress Tina Louise in 1960s TV comedy series Gilligan's Island.

Mr Corlett met with university officials in December and they allegedly told him last month he would be arrested if he set foot on the campus.

He was found guilty of intimidation by university officials at a hearing but a sexual harassment charge was dropped, reported ABC News.

They added that he was suspended for three semesters and must go through sensitivity counselling if he wishes to reapply next winter.

'The university has essentially issued a straightjacket to every writing student to protect the delicate sensibilities of faculty and staff'

His wife Lynn has supported him during his appeal to the decision and his lawyers say he has been treated like a ‘student with a mental disability’.

Ms Mitzelfeld told university officials that she would leave if they did not ban Mr Corlett from campus, reported the Huffington Post.

She also claimed she was concerned he might be carrying a gun in her classrooms after he allegedly wrote about his support for carrying concealed weapons in previous work.

This can be seen in a detailed letter he wrote to the Oakland Post student paper in January 2010, showing a strong understanding of the subject.

Compared: Hot for Teacher by Van Halen, pictured, was a sexually suggestive song from the U.S. band, which became famous for its bizarre video

‘This is a wild overreaction to a student's creative writing,’ FIRE President Greg Lukianoff, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said.

‘The university has essentially issued a straightjacket to every writing student to protect the delicate sensibilities of faculty and staff.’

Oakland University Writing Center director Sherry Wynn Perdue told the Huffington Post that Mr Corlett had ‘victimised’ Ms Mitzelfeld.

Hot for Teacher by Van Halen was a sexually suggestive song from the U.S. band's album 1984, which courted controversy with its bizarre video.
