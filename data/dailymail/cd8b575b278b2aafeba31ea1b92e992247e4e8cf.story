Prince Philip dubbed it 'bloody daft' and critics say that the idea of debutantes presenting themselves to the aristocracy is outdated and elitist, but for certain sections of British society the Queen Charlotte's Ball at the Royal Courts of Justice is the ultimate summer event.

Dubbed the 'crowning event of the London Season' the guest list is hand-picked with care: only young women from the richest families are invited to the  ball where, after months of careful preparation and spending thousands of pounds on each ticket, the young debutantes are able to show off their skills in poise and elegance.

In the past debutante balls were seen as a rite of passage for the young women of the upper classes, an opportunity to introduce themselves to society and seek out a potential suitor, but for today's debutantes the Season is seen as an opportunity to wear a designer gown, party their way around Europe, and do a little something for charity.

Trepidation: Debutantes wait nervously in line to be presented to guests

Today the debutantes, all aged 
between 17 and 20, follow the traditional Queen Charlotte's cake in to 
the ballroom where the girls perform special curtsies
 to their hosts (not, as popularly believed, to a massive cake) before 
being judged on their posture, elegance and pace by the room.

The
 event involves meetings with aristocracy, etiquette classes, and 
charity fund-raising, and the 'deb of the year' is chosen according to 
'who has worked hardest’ during 
fund-raising activities throughout the season and shown the most 
enthusiasm (she is usually the prettiest too, although that is not an official judging requirement).

The young women spend months preparing for their dramatic entrance in to the ballroom and go to several dress fittings to make sure their couture gowns cling perfectly.

Queen Charlotte's Ball was introduced by King George III in 1780 as a way to celebrate his wife’s birthday.

Up until 1958, young debutantes used to be presented to the Queen at Buckingham Palace, until Prince Philip pointed out that it was ‘bloody daft’.

Not only did parents hope their daughters would meet a suitable young man, the Season aimed to equip the young women with poise, confidence and social skills needed for their married lives.

The white dresses worn by the debutantes are a nod to the virginity that was once required of a bride. They are also a reminder of the outfits worn by Queen Charlotte's ladies, who all would have been single women.

As well as Prince Phillip's dismissal, the Queen felt such an elitist event was at odds with her desire for a more modern monarchy.

Her sister, Princess Margaret, was also reportedly not a fan. She is reported to have said: 'We had to put a stop to it - every tart in London was getting in.'

The London Season is rich in history and was formed over two hundred years ago

Prior to the event older debutantes 
are on hand to guide and critique the girls on their dress, dancing and 
pace around the ballroom and on the day an army of professional hair and
 make-up artists are on hand to make sure that the girls are glowing, 
setting off perfectly coiffed up 'dos with diamond studded tiaras and 
precious jewellery.

The 
ball was cancelled in 1976 because it was felt it had strayed too far 
from its more genteel and refined roots, but was resurrected in 2007  by
 a former debutane called Jenny Hallam-Peel, who was reportedly begged 
'top keep the season alive' by society magazine Tatler’s former social 
editor, Peter Townend, apparently begged Hallam-Peel from his deathbed.

Attendees are now from backgrounds that would have raised eyebrows among the social set of the event's heyday.

'In countries such as the U.S. and France, there’s still a section of high society that takes the 'Season’ very seriously, as a rite of passage for their daughters,' Caroline Castigliano, designer of this year’s ball gowns, told the Daily Telegraph.

'But in London, you’re not likely to meet the daughter of a duke any more. It’s far more likely to be the daughter of a hedge-funder, and her parents may be from the Middle East.'
