A Government tax adviser has resigned after he was secretly filmed offering tips on how to keep money 'out of the Chancellor's grubby mitts', according to reports.

David Heaton spoke at a London conference entitled, '101 ideas for personal tax planning', two months before becoming a member of a panel advising HM Revenue and Customs on tackling tax avoidance.

He stepped down after he was recorded by 
BBC's Panorama programme, as part of a joint investigation with Private 
Eye, outlining the advantages of tax planning, which he said included 
ways to keep the money from George Osborne's 'grubby mitts'.

Today, a Treasury minister said Heaton was 'directly at odds' with the Government's position.

Taxing situation: Heaton resigned after telling an audience how to reduce tax paid on bonuses by over 30 per cent

The treasury said that Mr Heaton's statements are directly at odds with the Government's approach to tackling tax avoidance

Mr Osborne was reportedly told about the comments - to be broadcast by the BBC on Monday - before flying to a meeting of European finance ministers in Lithuania.

A source said the Chancellor had been 'very annoyed' upon learning of Mr Heaton's comments and 'instructed tough action be taken'.

Mr Heaton denied doing anything wrong, but his resignation was announced yesterday, the BBC said.

He had also been filmed describing a maternity scheme he called the Bump Plan, and saying: 'Ninety per cent of what you pay out ends up with the employee. You can't really knock that one.'

He explained at the conference, in June, that by deliberately timing bonuses to enable an increased rebate on maternity pay, the tax paid on the bonus would effectively fall from 41.8 per cent to just 8.4 per cent, the BBC said.

David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the 
Treasury, said: 'The General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR) is designed to 
protect taxpayers. The role of the GAAR advisory panel is to make sure 
the GAAR is used where appropriate - that is to challenge the most 
artificial, contrived and aggressive behaviour.

'Mr Heaton's statements are directly at odds with the Government's approach to tackling tax avoidance. A member of the panel should not behave in a way that could undermine the GAAR and its effectiveness. Therefore, it is right that Mr Heaton resigned from his position.'

An HMRC spokesman said: 'The work of the General Anti Abuse Rule advisory panel plays an important role in HMRC's highly effective drive against tax abuse.

'The panel must command the confidence of both tax practioners and the general public. We will be announcing Mr Heaton's successor shortly.'Â 

Mr Heaton told Panorama: 'I do not believe a person who advocates artificial or abusive tax arrangements should be a panel member. I did not advocate any such arrangement at the conference and do not advocate such arrangements.'

Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge told the BBC: 'This is an absolutely classic example of where government passes a law with a particular intent and the tax advisers then abuse that and use it for a purpose that was never intended by government.'
