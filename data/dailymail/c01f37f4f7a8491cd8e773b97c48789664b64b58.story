England are considering an early Test call-up for Saracens’ new, uncapped Australian prop, Kieran Longbottom - who is eligible and has revealed his desire to push for selection.

The 28-year-old known as ‘K-bomb’ joined the north London club from Perth-based Western Force during the summer, despite being told by Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie that he was in contention for international honours.

He has impressed in his first two Aviva Premiership appearances for Saracens and amid a dearth of established English tightheads, it is understood that he is being viewed as a candidate for Stuart Lancaster’s national squad, to be named on October 22.

With Leicester’s Dan Cole due to miss the autumn internationals at Twickenham as he recovers from neck surgery, David Wilson of Bath is destined to continue as first-choice at No 3. But behind him, stocks are low. Henry Thomas, is spending long periods on Bath’s bench while developing his scrummaging, and Kyle Sinckler of Harlequins is another rookie with considerable raw potential who is still honing his craft.

On Monday, England forwards coach Graham Rowntree was in Newcastle to watch Kieran Brookes play for the Falcons’ reserves. Despite being capped against New Zealand in June, the 24-year-old is struggling at his club and has been demoted from the match-day 23.

Against this backdrop, Longbottom - whose maternal grandmother was born in Yorkshire - has been identified as an immediate solution in a problem position. He is ready to answer the call, after belatedly discovering that he qualifies for England.

‘The fact that I ended up finding out I am eligible to play for England is a bonus,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It is something I had never really thought of. My initial intention was to come over here, learn to be a better scrummager then after a few years go back and hopefully be one of the best tightheads in Australia. Then I could have another crack at it (playing for Australia). But whatever happens, happens. Other opportunities present themselves.

‘I hold an Australian passport, but my nana on my mum’s side was born in Halifax. I sort of knew it but I didn’t know what that meant in terms of eligibility. It’s just one of those things - that was a good break for me I suppose.’

Quite how much of a good break is only now dawning on Longbottom. If he was a loosehead, he would be low down a long, high-class queue of England contenders, but at tighthead he is instantly in the mix. If Lancaster or Rowntree make contact, he won’t hesitate to make himself available.

‘It would be a massive honour to play for England,’ he said. ‘There is a massive, proud history behind the team, so to be able to play for them would be something I would be very proud of. It would be another opportunity for me and I would want to take it.

‘It was good to play at Twickenham the other day. It is bloody impressive. It would be an honour to play there for England. When I was planning to come over here, I didn’t even know that I would be eligible, but afterwards it was spelled out to me. At the time I thought, Right, whatever, that’s not going to happen”. But coming here now, maybe it is going to happen and that is pretty exciting.’

England would be pinching him from under the noses of the Wallabies - Pool A rivals at next year’s World Cup. Longbottom was in the mix to represent his country, but encouraging noises didn’t lead to caps, so he decided to try his luck elsewhere.

‘Ewen McKenzie came and spoke to me at training in pre-season,’ he said. ‘Then during the season I thought I was going well, but I didn’t hear anything else from them (Australia). When this opportunity came along I just thought, “I could snap my leg in the next game, so I have to take this”.

‘When I spoke to Foles (Force coach Michael Foley) and told him I was planning on doing it, he said, “But you are on their (Australia’s) radar”. Maybe I was on their radar, but there was a beaming light shining me in the face, coming from here. It was a massive opportunity and I couldn’t just ignore that, hoping for something else to happen.’

In his early games for Saracens, Longbottom has made a positive set-piece impact, despite finding the scrums markedly different to what he was used to Down Under. ‘Guys aren’t afraid to attack on their own ball and on the opposition’s ball,’ he said. ‘I have only played four games here so far but already I’ve had to deal with looseheads who love standing up and coming in.

‘In Australia we like to keep the scrum steady and straight, to have a good attacking platform off it, whereas here it is a real contest to go forward, see how much damage you can do, try to fracture them and get a penalty. It’s a good contest. That’s why I play the game - to have a battle with the other bloke and shake his hand at the end.’

A love of proper, combative scrummaging will go down well with Rowntree. So far, Longbottom is doing and saying all the right things to advance his England prospects.
