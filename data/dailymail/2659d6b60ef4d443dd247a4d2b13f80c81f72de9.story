Fresh footage emerged today that casts doubt on George Zimmerman's version of events in the shooting of Trayvon Martin.

In the video, filmed shortly after the unarmed teen was killed, Zimmerman is seen emerging from a police vehicle with his hands cuffed behind his back as he is frisked and led into questioning by officers.

Despite his lawyer’s account that Zimmerman was knocked down and suffered a broken nose in a scuffle with Martin, the video, provided to ABC News, shows no injuries consistent with his description.

Doubt? Despite his lawyer's account that Zimmerman was knocked down and suffered a broken nose in a scuffle with Martin, the video shows no injuries consistent with his description

Trayvon's parents Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin told CNN’s Piers Morgan that the video proves 'what they have known all along'.

Ms Fulton told Morgan: 'We just looked at the video and we were just surprised because according to the police report, he sustained injuries, but when we looked at the video, it was obvious that there were no visible injuries. [there was no] blood on his shirt.'

She later added: 'I believe that this video is the icing on the cake'.

The family's lawyer, Benjamin Crumb, told Morgan that the footage proves that the Sanford Police Department 'conspired to cover this up'.

Zimmerman, who has not spoken publicly since the shooting, told police that he spotted Martin as he was patrolling his neighbourhood and called 911 to report a suspicious person.

'This guy looks like he is up to no good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from his sport utility vehicle. 

He added that the teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes.'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman said on a 911 call.

But Trayvon, 17, was not armed. He was returning from a convenience store with an iced tea for himself and a bag of skittles for his little brother.

Protests: The killing of Trayvon Martin has sparked numerous demonstrations across the country, like this one in front of the White House

A student newspaper has been slammed for publishing a 'racist' cartoon (below) suggesting Trayvon Martin's death has been hyped up by the media.

The University of Texas at Austin 'Daily Texan' publication also sparked outrage by misspelling the gunned down teen's name.

In the illustration, a woman wearing glasses sits on a chair called 'The Media' holding a book called 'Treyvon Martin and the case of yellow journalism'.

She is seen telling a young boy: 'And then…  the Big Bad White man killed the Handsome, sweet, innocent, colored boy!!'

Student Stephanie Eisner, who drew the cartoon, said she wanted to criticise the media's coverage rather than Trayvon.

She initially told the publication: 'I feel the news should be unbiased. And in the retelling of this particular event, I felt that that was not the case.

She later apologised, saying it was 'in hindsight an ambiguous cartoon related to the Trayvon Martin shooting'.

The newspaper's editorial adviser, Doug Warren, admitted the cartoon should have spelled the teen's name correctly and not used the word 'coloured'. But he said the cartoon was not inherently racist.

A neighbour said there had been several 
break-ins in the community in the past year, including one in which 
burglars took a TV and laptops.

A dispatcher told Zimmerman to stay in his sport utility vehicle and that an officer would be there momentarily, but Zimmerman - for unknown reasons - got out.

Zimmerman told police he lost sight of the teenager and was walking back to his sport utility vehicle when he was suddenly attacked. 

But Trayvon's girlfriend Deedee, 16, who was on the phone with Trayvon in his last moments alive, emerged Wednesday to add more contradiction to Zimmerman's story.

She told ABC News in a brief interview that Trayvon said he saw a strange man following him as he walked back to his father's home.

'... and then Trayvon come and said the man was still behind him and I said to him, "Run!"' the teen said.

He and Martin fought, according to witnesses.

Zimmerman said Martin punched him in the nose and slammed his head against the ground.

Zimmerman’s father Robert Zimmerman echoed those remarks on Wednesday night, telling WOFL-TV his son was being beaten by Trayvon, and the teen threatened him during the scuffle.

He told the network: 'Trayvon Martin said something to the effect of "you're going to die now or you're going to die tonight," something to that effect'.

He added: ‘[Martin] continued to beat George and at some point, George pulled his pistol and did what he did’.

Zimmerman told cops he acted in self-defense, and that he had yelled for help before firing the gun.

Police said Zimmerman was bleeding from his nose and the back of his head.

But the surveillance video shows no injuries consistent with that type of trauma.

Additionally, Richard Kurtz, the funeral director who handled Trayvon's body, told CNN he saw no bruising on the teen's knuckles.

'I didn't see any evdience that he had been fighting anybody,' Kurtz said.

In the police video, Zimmerman appears calm as his pockets are checked and he’s led to a questioning room by three officers.

In an appearance on MSNBC’s 
PoliticsNation on Wednesday night, the mother of a witness in the case 
said that she doesn't believe the account of Zimmerman's lawyer.

When asked by host Al Sharpton if she believed Zimmerman acted in self-defence, Cheryl Brown answered: 'Not at all'.

The
fact that he has not been arrested nor charged in the case has fuelled a
widespread outcry marked by protests, accusations of racism and demands
that Zimmerman be taken in.
