A reporter who had an affair with Dateline NBC star Chris Hansen has spoken out about what she says is a double standard against women in broadcast media.

The outburst comes as 32-year-old Kristyn Caddell released photographs allegedly showing her kissing Hansen, who had previously said reports of the affair had been 'full of hurtful lies'.

Miss Caddell claims that she has not been able to find work since their four-month affair was revealed, while Hansen has continued unscathed by the scandal, according to RadarOnline.

The reporter said she had worked at three stations since the affair was revealed in 2011, but claims she was unable to hold down a job because of the stigma of the relationship.

'No matter what your philosophy is 
on someone who has an affair, if it was the man or the woman’s fault, 
there are two people involved and if I can’t work, he should not be able
to work,' Miss Caddell told RadarOnline.

'I have lived the double standard,' she 
added. 'A double standard is an understatement as to what happens in 
this industry. The women get fired and the men keep going.'

Miss Caddell met 54-year-old Hansen in Palm Beach, Florida, when she was a news reporter for NBC affiliate WPTV.

She claimed he led her to believe his 20-year marriage to Mary Joan was ending and he was therefore able to date.

'I believed him with my heart,' Miss Caddell, who is not married and does not have children, said. 'You can say I was naive, as it was. That was my biggest crime, being naive ... I make one personal mistake and I am [considered] a worthless human being.'

Denial: When the National Enquirer first revealed the affair, Chris Hansen said the pair were just friends

Hansen, a father who is best known for his show To Catch a Predator, had previously claimed evidence showing his alleged affair was just a picture of him going out to dinner. 

'I understand the perceived irony of 
the, you know, so-called "gotcha guy" getting gotcha-ed,' he said in March last year. 'But what the "gotcha guy" got gotcha-ed 
doing was going out to dinner.'

The National Enquirer had revealed the affair after the pair were recorded enjoying a romantic dinner at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Manalapan, before spending the night at Miss Caddell's Palm Beach apartment.

However, in images Miss Caddell has just released, Hansen is shown kissing her.

She claims he did not try to hide their relationship at the time, and she believed it was public knowledge before the Enquirer exposed it.

'Chris was flying me all over the 
country; putting us up in the finest hotels; having dinner and mingling 
with many of his colleagues; having our photographs taken together in 
public places ... Chris 
gave me no reason at all to believe our relationship was a secret and I 
trusted him explicitly,' she said in an open letter to the Enquirer earlier this month.

Miss Caddell said she decided to release the images because the affair was still affecting her ability to find work. She told the National Enquirer that potential employers told her they were put off because of the negative publicity surrounding her.

'For the past two 
years, I was told that it would be in my best interests not to say 
anything. Let it blow over. Just keep trying to truck along and keep 
trying to get jobs.

“But we
are here two years later and I probably don’t go a day without an 
employer tell me they do not want to hire me because of the situation 
involving Chris Hansen.'

She added: “I 
thought by not saying anything, and Chris advised me that it would be in 
my best interest not to say anything, that I would continue to go and and
my life would go back to normal. My life has been the exact opposite of
that.'

Dreams shattered: Kristyn Caddell says the scandal has ruined her career as a news reporter

The reporter added that she had struggled to break into journalism, and just before the affair, had finally felt like her career was taking off.

'Then, to essentially get taken down, because of a man, who has a lot of money and a lot of fame, it is not a good feeling. That is what happened to me,' she said.

Hansen has previously claimed the pair were no more than friends, according to Fox News.
