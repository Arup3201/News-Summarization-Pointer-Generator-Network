An eclectic example of some of the best architectural work from across the globe designed by Australians have been recognised at the 2014 International Architecture Awards.

The Australian Institute of Architects’ has announced the winners of five awards spanning public, residential, commercial, interior and small project architecture which were decided by a jury led by 2013 Institute Gold Medallist, Peter Wilson.

The Stonehenge Exhibition and Visitor Centre by Denton Corker Marshall received an Award for Public Architecture.

'This is a building that does justice to a UNESCO World Heritage site; its lightness and reversibility giving dignity to the solidity and timelessness of the standing stones 2.4 km away beyond the horizon,' Jury Chair Peter Wilson said of the Melbourne architects.

Kerry Hill Architects dominated the Residential Architecture category receiving an award for The Sukhothai Residences in Bangkok and a commendation for Urban Suites.

The highly-acclaimed PARKROYAL on Pickering, Singapore, was further applauded with an award for Commercial Architecture, 'achieving a fine balance of the natural and the cultural,' the jury said.

The Interior Architecture category belonged to Queensland’s BVN Donovan Hill with the jury presenting the award to the ASB North Wharf building in Auckland’s Wynyard Quarter.

The five projects now progress to the National Architecture Awards to be announced in November in Darwin and will compete for the Jørn Utzon Award for International Architecture.

The Sukhothai Residences in Bangkok:

The residential slabs wear a concrete Mondrian brise soleil frock

The hedonistic landscape has shady and light filtering a nine-metre-high colonnade and three bamboo filled light wells

A pool house pavilion updates and abstracts an Indian typology, stripped of Mogul decoration, with a bar and gym lurking behind glass wafers

PARKROYAL on Pickering in Singapore:

The front faces north-east over a park with tree canopies into the landscape of the pool terrace

The poolside cabanas in the hotel that is located in downtown Singapore

The block-sized hotel consists of three linked towers in an E-shaped plan on a podium shared by a speculative office building

The swimming pool on level five cascades into a garden that loops the podium-top; heavy timbers project over the water with light gangways spanning to suspended cabanas

ASB North Wharf building in Auckland:

The office is organised by perpendicular atria, one above a common laneway bisecting the site at ground level

Ultra modern blue bulbous pod-like rooms are used for meeting places

The day-lit volumes are used to great effect with crisscrossing bridges allowing visual connectivity between floors

Bright colours signpost the collaborative areas while the base building palette is neutral grey, white and natural timber

The Stonehenge Exhibition and Visitor Centre in Wiltshire, England:

The Visitor Centre feels Australian - a sheep-pen and wool shed to shear the visitor flock of their spare change while dispensing a basic understanding of where and why they are there

The multiple poles that hold the wafer thin roof aloft is reminiscent of the Aboriginal activist delegation that landed on the shores of England in the 1970s

The two pavilions, one timber clad and the other glass, puts the visitor conceptually and physically into the mysterious landscape of the Salisbury Plain

A longhouse in of the jungle in Borneo:

This house boasts an exemplary list of ecological and environmental credentials: sustainable re-forestation, locally harvested materials, solar energy, rainwater collection, biotechnologies and minimal site disturbance

The shiny roof is such a familiar Australian trope that it is almost surprising to see it here returned to its locus and reference of origin

The technology and detailing are more than appropriate to the location and climate while the spaces are rich in seductive atmosphere and ambience
