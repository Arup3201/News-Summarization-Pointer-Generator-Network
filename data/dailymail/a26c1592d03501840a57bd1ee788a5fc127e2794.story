Targeted: Scientists used MRI scanning to show that, when we're looking for something, areas of the brain used for other mental tasks are redirected to help with the search

The human brain can quickly mobilise a highly focused 'search party' to track down a lost item, scientists claim.

When people hunt for lost keys, a missing mobile phone, or a pet gone astray, their brain rapidly redirects areas normally dedicated to other mental tasks to help.

According to researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, when we embark on a targeted search, various visual and non-visual regions of the brain shift their focus to track down the missing item.

It means that, if we are looking for a child lost in a crowd, brain regions usually dedicated to recognising other objects - or even those associated with abstract thought - are reallocated to the task in hand, transforming the brain into a highly-focused child-finder.

'Our results show that our brains are much more dynamic than previously thought, rapidly reallocating resources based on behavioural demands, and optimising our performance by increasing the precision with which we can perform relevant tasks,' said Tolga Cukur, a postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience at U.C. Berkeley, and lead author of the study.

'As you plan your day at work, for 
example, more of the brain is devoted to processing time, tasks, goals 
and rewards, and as you search for your cat, more of the brain becomes 
involved in recognition of animals,' he said.

The findings, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, help to explain why we find it difficult to concentrate on more than one task at the same time.

The results also shed light on how people are able to shift their attention to challenging tasks, and may provide greater insight into neurobehavioral and attention deficit disorders such as ADHD.

The results were obtained via studies that used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to record the brain activity of study participants as they searched for people or vehicles in movie clips.

One experiment saw subjects hold down a button whenever a person appeared on screen, while in another, they did the same with vehicles. As they were doing so, the brain scans simultaneously measured neural activity via blood flow in thousands of locations across the brain.

The scientists said the biggest changes they identified occurred in the prefrontal cortex - an area usually thought to be involved in abstract thought and long-term planning.

Researchers used regularized linear regression analysis, which finds correlations in data, to build models showing how each of the roughly 50,000 locations near the cortex responded to each of the 935 categories of objects and actions seen in the movie clips.

Next, they compared how much of the cortex was devoted to detecting humans or vehicles depending on whether or not each of those categories was the search target.

They found that, when participants searched for humans, relatively more of the cortex was devoted to humans, and when they searched for vehicles, more of the cortex was devoted to vehicles.

For example, areas usually involved in recognising specific visual categories such as plants or buildings switched to become tuned to humans or vehicles - vastly expanding the area of the brain engaged in the search.

'These changes occur across many brain regions, not only those devoted to vision. In fact, the largest changes are seen in the prefrontal cortex, which is usually thought to be involved in abstract thought, long-term planning and other complex mental tasks,' Mr Cukur said.

The findings build on a previous U.C. Berkeley brain imaging study which revealed how the brain organises thousands of animate and inanimate objects into what researchers call a 'continuous semantic space'.

Those findings challenged previous assumptions that every visual category is represented in a separate region of the visual cortex. Instead, researchers found that categories are actually represented in highly organised, continuous maps.
