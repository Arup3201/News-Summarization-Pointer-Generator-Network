Taiwanese officials said they sent two fighter planes to intercept Sukhoi-27 jets after the Chinese aircraft breached its airspace for first time in 12 years.

The Chinese Sukhoi-27s had reportedly crossed a boundary to pursue a U.S. spy plane sent on a surveillance flight over China.

Taiwan's Defence Ministry said it sent two aircraft to intercept the Chinese jets, which had briefly crossed a line in the centre of the Tiawan Strait considered an unofficial air boundary between the two states.

The Taiwanese United Daily News had reported that the incident - described as an 'accident' by Taiwanese officials - saw the Chinese jets in pursuit of a U.S. U-2 reconnaissance plane.

However, both the Taiwanese Defence ministry and the Pentagon declined to confirm the report.

Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked about the June 29 incident and said the U.S. would maintain flying in international airspace.

Mr Mullen said in Washington: 'The Chinese would see us move out of there. ... We're not going to do that, from my perspective. These reconnaissance flights are important.

'We won't be deterred from flying in international airspace.'

Mr Mullen's spokesperson later said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not have specific knowledge of the reported incursion and was only speaking generally about the U.S. right to conduct surveillance flights in international airspace in the region.

The Pentagon did not immediately confirm or deny details about the incident.

Chinese jets regularly attempt to intercept U.S. reconnaissance aircraft to show they are aware of the U.S. presence.

In 2001, when a US Navy surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet trying to intercept it over the South China Sea.

The US aircraft made an emergency landing on a Chinese island and its crew were briefly detained.

Mr Mullen added: 'These are lives that are at stake up there, in addition to creating an incident ... that escalates the tension over there and could put countries in a position to miscalculate.'

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she will announce on Oct 1 whether the United States will answer a call from Taiwan for more F-16 fighter jets.

Taiwan is also still waiting for an upgrade to its existing US-made F-16 fighter jets, six new cargo aircraft and an overhaul to a fleet of Lafayette frigates.
