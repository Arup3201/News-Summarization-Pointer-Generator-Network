The practice of Stop-and-Frisk in New York virtually ended in the second half of 2013.

This is according to the New York Times, who mapped out police stops in New York City comparing the first half of 2012 and the second half of 2013.

Supporters of the controversial policy warned of a resurgence in violent crime if it was banned, as Mayor Bill de Blasio campaigned to do, but so far New York has stayed as safe as ever. 

Over and done: Mayor Bill de Blasio came into office promising to end the controversial and 'unconstitutional' practice of Stop-and-Frisk

New York's first lady, Chirlaine McCray, has apparently taken an interest in NYPD policy as well, attending a meeting on Thursday of top officials examining the city's use of Compstat, which collects data on crimes throughout the city.

Former Police Commissioner Ray Kelly made the practice of stopping people behaving 'suspiciously' a regular part of police practice for the NYPD during his tenure from 2002 to 2013.

But with a federal court ruling that declared the practice unconstitutional and a new mayor dedicated to ending it, Stop-and-Frisk numbers fell drastically in the last half of 2013. 

According to New York Times reporting, in 2012 most of the stops were concentrated in central Brooklyn and those stopped were overwhelmingly African American or Hispanic.

Police deployed in Precinct 77 in the northern part of Crown Heights, for instance, were stopping 75 to 100 people a day. That number has since fallen off.

Former commissioner Ray Kelly promised last year on Meet the Press that 'violent crime will go up' if Stop-and-Frisk is ended, so far evidence has not borne that out.

Insiders: First Lady Chirlaine McCray and her son, Dante de Blasio, got a behind-the-scenes look at how Compstat programs work in New York

Unconstitutional: Critics called Stop-and-Frisk unconstitutional and said there was no evidence that it lowered violent crime rates

Reuters reported in June there was a 13% increase in shootings since January compared to a similar stretch in 2013.

But the Daily News found that August was the safest month in the city since the Compstat program was instituted in 1994.  

Beyond stopping Stop-and-Frisk, the First Family has so far been very interested in how the NYPD patrol's New York's streets.

DNAinfo reported that de Blasio's wife Chirlaine McCray attended a meeting on Compstat where high-ranking officials grilled NYPD supervisors and commanders about precinct-level crime rates.

A city official only said that 'the first lady has been wanting to learn more about policing in the city and how the NYPD is structured' and did not explain further.

de Blasio's son Dante also attended a meeting on Compstat focused on the Bronx while interning with Deputy Mayor Anthony Shorris. 

Residents interviewed by the New York Times who previously had been stopped and frisked said they still felt ill at ease.

Tijay Lewis, 15, said he'd been stopped 10 times since he turned 13. He said hadn't been stopped for months and told the paper 'It feels a little bit different.'
