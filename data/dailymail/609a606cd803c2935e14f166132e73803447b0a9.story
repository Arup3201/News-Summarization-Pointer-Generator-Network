Diner Anthony Nelson was amazed when he spotted the face of his dead grandmother - in a naan bread.

Mr Nelson, 22, of Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, was enjoying a meal at a curry house with his family to celebrate a new job and ordered a round of naan breads to share.

But when he lifted up the south-Asian flatbread, he discovered an uncanny profile of his late grandmother Sheila Nelson.

The production company editor said: 'I looked up and saw it and it was so spooky - it looked just like her profile.

'I turned to my sister Heather and whispered "who does that look like?" and she said, straight away, "It’s Sheila".

'I didn’t say anything but then my dad said "That looks like me mam".

'He couldn’t believe it. He turned to one of the waiting staff and said "Look - It’s my mam! That’s her profile!" but the waiter’s reaction was, "Oh".

'Obviously he had no reference to what Sheila looked like, but it was exactly like her profile. It was like she was there with us.'

The family had their encounter with the plain naan at Akbah’s in Middlesbrough last month.

Housewife Sheila Nelson passed away of natural causes in 2008, aged 77.

'She was quite a character in the family,' said Anthony.

'She didn’t hold back on her opinions.

'I have heard about the Virgin Mary appearing on someone’s toast and the Duchess of Cambridge in a jellybean - but I never expected to see Sheila.'
