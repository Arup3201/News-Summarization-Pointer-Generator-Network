The challenge double-amputee Kayden Elijah faces is heartbreakingly obvious - but he doesn't seem to know it.

With his hands clasped to a walker, the two-year-old inches down the corridor, swaying and falling into the hands of a carer hovering nearby.

But Elijah never loses faith, repeatedly saying 'I got it'.

Then loses his balance and falls

Steadying himself he tries again

Elijah steps out on his own

Inching away from his carer

He smiles up at onlookers

After each fall, he steadies himself again and pushes forward. 'One, two,' the carer says and Elijah echoes it back.

She then tells him to keep his legs wider, but he just keeps defiantly repeating, 'I got it'.

The video was originally posted to You Tube and Facebook by Elijah's mother, Nikki Kinko, of New Jersey, but has now been shared around the world.

Ms Kinko is trying to raise money to pay for more therapy and equipment for her son through fundraising website gofundme. About £1300 has so far been raised.

On the page, Ms Kinko explains that Elijah was born with Omhalocele, a condition that meant his organs remained on the outside of his body.

He also had a band wrap around his legs and feet which led to some deformity.

Elijah had two surgeries for the condition, and in January had his right foot and left leg amputated.

Ms Kinko writes on the page: 'We are raising money for extra physical therapy visits, braces and prosthetics for Kayden and to pay off outstanding medical bills.'

'We are also trying to publish a book about his life and prayerfully have him attend a camp for children with prosthetics in Atlanta when he is old enough.'

She also revealed that doctors had advised her during her pregnancy that Elijah 'wouldn't make it'.
