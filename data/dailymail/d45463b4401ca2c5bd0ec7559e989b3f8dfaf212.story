Devastated: Walter Morris (pictured) was holding a tin containing £26,000 of his life savings in banknotes when it was swiped by thieves

It was the day that Blackpool’s Golden Mile fully lived up to its name.

A stolen tin of Quality Street containing a pensioner’s £26,000 life savings fell open and piles of banknotes fluttered off in the wind.

Cue pandemonium on the prom, as tourists ran along gathering up the unexpected windfall.

The 76-year-old victim, Walter Morris, had taken the tin to the resort to fulfil his dream of buying a seaside caravan for his mentally handicapped son, also called Walter.

The two men were sitting at a table in the Coral Island amusement arcade watching people playing slot machines when the thieves struck. The tin was in a carrier bag under the table.

The thieves, Liam Davis, 23, and 17-year-old Aaron Scott were both drunk and when they grabbed the bag they thought they were stealing chocolates.

Initially they tried to sell the tin for £5 to passers-by, but they couldn’t find any takers so made off along the promenade, a court heard yesterday.

Davis then ran into a brick wall and the tin fell open, with notes spilling on to the pavement. At that moment a gust of wind blew and lifted thousands of pounds into the air and along the seafront.

Holidaymakers began chasing after the notes while the thieves laughed hysterically as they shoved bundles of cash into their jackets, Lancaster Crown Court was told.

Yesterday Davis, of Marton, Blackpool, was jailed for four months. The case against Scott, who is also from Blackpool, was adjourned until June 11 for a pre-sentence report. Both pleaded guilty to theft.

The court heard that Davis took £11,750, but £8,010 was left behind at the spot where the notes had fallen out of the tin.

It was recovered by passers-by Louise Lane and Emily Herringe, and off-duty police officer Meghann Ferryhough, who handed it to the police.

Davis buried the cash he had taken in a nearby park, but when he was arrested later he handed it back apart from £15 which he had spent on cigarettes and drink.

Sweet and sour: The 76-year-old victim had kept the cash in a tin of Quality Street

No money has been recovered from Scott. Mr Morris has been given back just under £20,000 of the cash, but another £6,240 remains unaccounted for.

Kirsten McAteer, prosecuting, said Mr Morris had been unaware of the events that unfolded after his bag and tin were taken in April last year. He searched the area outside the arcade before returning home to Blackburn and alerting the police.

After the case, Mr Morris said that he had been saving the money for most of his life to buy a seafront static caravan for his disabled son, but now he would be unable to do so.

The former millworker, who is a full-time carer for 46-year-old Walter, said: ‘Even though I got some of the money back I don’t think I’ll ever get over it really and for weeks afterwards I couldn’t sleep because I just kept thinking about all the money that I had lost.

‘It was just a mistake on my part that I took the money with me but now I’ll never be able to buy Walter his caravan. I just feel very sad about the whole matter.’
