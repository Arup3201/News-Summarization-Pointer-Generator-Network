The Syrian Electronic Army has claimed responsibility for a cyber attack after the pro-Assad group hacked into the U.S. Marines website on Monday and posted seemingly staged pictures of 'servicemen' holding up signs condemning American military strikes. 

The picture of an unidentified man, dressed like a Navy officer, swept the web after he appeared in full regalia while covering his face with a sign which read: 'I didn't join the Navy to fight for al Qaeda in a Syrian civil war!'

It has now been revealed that marines.com was infiltrated by the SEA but quickly returned to normal. It follows the hacking of the New York Times website last week where nothing but error messages appeared for seven hours.

Hacked: The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) posted this message on the U.S Marines website with pictures of 'servicemen' holding up signs condemning attacks

Faked: An unidentified man, dressed in Navy regalia and believed to have been staged by pro-Assad hackers, offered this message on the deepening crisis in Syria as the U.S. comes closer to military intervention

The SEA wrote a long message to its 
'brothers' in the Marines, according to the International Business 
Times.

The hack included pictures of men dressed in U.S. military uniforms 
holding up signs condemning attacks on Syria. 

Since the image appeared online, it has been re-tweeted hundreds of times and shared thousands of times on Facebook.

The SEA's latest hack comes as President Obama and his top aides launch a
 full-scale political offensive to persuade a skeptical 
Congress to approve a military strike against Syria.

The administration faces an uphill 
struggle to win over lawmakers from both parties and a war-weary 
American public.

Call for action: Protesters demanding military action shout over those opposing it at joint rallies in Washington DC on Sunday

Split: Protesters for and against military action confront each other outside the White House

Crisis talks: President Obama and Vice-President Biden meet with Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Advisor Susan Rice to discuss Syria on Sunday

The President made calls to members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with more scheduled for today, underscoring the task confronting the administration before it can go ahead with using force in response to a deadly chemical attack blamed on the Syrian government.

Protesters across the country took to the streets this weekend for and against a possible U.S.-led attack on Syria.

In Houston, Texas, which has a large Syrian-American population, about 100 people lined up on opposite sides of a street in an upscale neighborhood to express opposing views on a possible U.S. attack.

'We want any kind of action. The world has stood silently and it's been too long. Something needs to be done,' said Tamer Barazi, a 23-year-old civil engineer who carried a Syrian flag and a sign - 'Syrian Americans for peace, democracy and freedom in Syria.'

Demonstrations erupted on both East and West coasts of the United States, and cities in between.

In DC, 
anti-war demonstrators chanted and waved placards outside the White 
House. Across the street, Syrians and Syrian Americans who support U.S. 
action waved flags from their country and shouted for Assad's ouster.

Later,
 in Los Angeles, about 200 people shouting 'Hands off Syria' protested 
against a possible American strike.

They waved signs reading 'No More 
War' and police said they wrote up more than 40 citations after 
demonstrators sat in street intersections and blocked traffic. Police 
reported two arrests.

Dozens of lawmakers, some in tennis shirts or shirtsleeves, cut short their vacations and streamed into the corridors of the Capitol building for a Sunday afternoon intelligence briefing on Syria with Obama's national security team.

But the credibility of the 
administration's intelligence is turning out to be a less important 
issue than the nature and usefulness of the response.

U.S. military officials are using the
 delay to reassess which ships will be used for a strike, and which 
sites in Syria to target.

One
 change was a decision to send the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and its 
entire strike group towards the Red Sea to help support the Syria 
strike, if needed.

Syria's brutal two-and-a-half-year-old conflict has claimed more than 100,000 lives, including hundreds who - according to the U.S. - were killed in chemical weapons attacks by the Syrian regime near Damascus on August 21.

Syrian President Bashar Assad's 
government has denied involvement, instead blaming rebels for the 
attacks. Neither the U.S. nor the Assad regime has presented proof in 
public to back up the allegations.

In
 Washington, Obama was lobbying Congress to support a military strike to
 punish the Assad regime for its alleged chemical weapons use.

Obama
 initially seemed poised to launch military action without asking 
Congress, but over the weekend changed his mind.

A vote is expected 
after Congress returns from summer recess on September 7.

Obama was to meet with former 
political rival Senator John McCain at the White House on Monday, hoping
 the foreign policy hawk will help sell the idea of U.S. military 
intervention.

On Capitol 
Hill, senior administration officials briefed lawmakers in private on 
Sunday to explain why the U.S. was compelled to act against Assad. 
Further meetings were planned from Monday to Wednesday.

The Arab League, meanwhile, stopped short of endorsing military action. In an emergency meeting in Cairo on Sunday, it called on the United Nations and the international community to take 'deterrent' measures under international law to stop the Syrian regime's crimes, but could not agree on whether to back U.S. military strikes.

Two of Assad's most influential 
foreign backers, China and Russia, lined up against Washington's new 
attempt to make the case for a military strike.

China
 is 'highly concerned' about possible unilateral military action against
 Syria and believes the international community must 'avoid complicating
 the Syrian issue and dragging the Middle East down into further 
disaster,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in Beijing on 
Monday.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey 
Lavrov, meanwhile, dismissed U.S. information given to Moscow on the 
alleged chemical weapons attack as 'absolutely unconvincing'.

There
 was 'nothing specific' in the evidence presented by Washington, Lavrov 
said. 'No geographic coordinates, no names, no proof that the tests were
 carried out by the professionals.'

He did not say what tests he was referring to.

Lavrov said U.S. officials told the Russian government they cannot share all the evidence because some of it is classified.

On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. received new physical evidence in the form of blood and hair samples that show sarin gas was used in the August 21 attack.

Kerry said the U.S. must respond with its credibility on the line.

The Syria conflict erupted in March 2011 as an uprising against Assad that quickly transformed into a civil war.

The fighting has displaced 5 million inside Syria, according to the UN. In addition, nearly 2 million Syrians have crossed into neighboring countries, previously released UN figures show.

Before the outbreak of the conflict, Syria had a population of about 23 million people.
