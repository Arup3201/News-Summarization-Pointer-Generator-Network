A faulty phone charger is believed to be the cause of a massive blaze which ripped through a house in Sydney on Thursday morning. 

A family of five were preparing to depart for the day when they noticed smoke billowing from the hall of their Malcolm Avenue home at Mt Pritchard, in Sydney's west, about 7.45am.

A man, a woman and their three children - two aged in their 20s and a girl, 13 - were lucky to escape the  inferno which a NSW Fire and Rescue spokesman believed was sparked by a 'cheap, after-market' phone charger.

The fire aftermath of the Mt Pritchard blaze which fire investigators believed started by a faulty charger

More than 80 per cent of the house was damaged in the Thursday morning blaze

The fire got alight at the end of a cul-de-sac in the western Sydney suburb of Mt Pritchard

The family of five managed to flee when they noticed smoke billowing in the hallway  

Fire investigators combing through the aftermath of the blaze are still yet to confirm the type of charger, but strongly suspect that it is what sparked the electrical blaze at the front of the home.

'It will take probably take until this time tomorrow to come up with a determination, but at this point the indicators are pointing in that direction (faulty phone charger),' the spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.

He said given the ferocity of the fire, which left the home with 80 per cent structural damage, it would be hard to determine what type of charger it was.

'It is well known that those particular types of after market chargers are dangerous,' he said. 

He called for a ban on the sale of generic charges which are not manufactured by the companies who sell the phones they are designed to charge. 

'That's why iPhone chargers are not cheap - they are specific chargers built for those phones.'

The family were preparing to head to work and school when the suspected electrical blaze started

Crews from seven western Sydney suburbs were called to help extinguish the blaze

A cherry picker was used to help bring it under control 

Police cordoned off the area and spoke with the family affected

The family managed to escape before the house's roof collapsed 

Meanwhile paramedics at the scene said the family, who had been preparing to leave to go to school and work, was lucky to scramble to safety prior to the roof collapsing.

Fire inspector Kernan Lambert said crews worked overtime to save the two adjacent properties on either side of the burning home. 

'Firefighters had to conduct an extremely aggressive attack on the fire, on all sides, to protect those houses,' said Inspector Kernan Lambert from NSW Fire and Rescue.

'And then we've moved in to commence extinguish of the house that was actually alight.'

Fire crews from seven western Sydney suburbs were sent to battle the fire and a cherry picker was used to help extinguish it.
