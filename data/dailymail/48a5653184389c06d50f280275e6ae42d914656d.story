It took photographer Saskia Nelson eight years of online dating before she finally found her prince. The most frustrating part of her dating experience? Constantly meeting people who looked nothing like their profile photographs.

On one occasion the 44-year-old couldn't find her date in a bar so called his phone only to realise he was standing right next to her - looking utterly different to the hunk she was expecting.

On another date destined for failure she says she turned up expecting someone 'who looked like David Beckham' only to to be faced with someone who looked 'more like Columbo'.

'Needless to say, I didn’t stay long,' says the Battersea-based photographer. 'It’s not that I’m shallow about looks - far from it - but it’s about being
 honest to people from the outset. Lying about age, height or looks is
 not a great way to start a meaningful relationship.'

'Even if guys didn't intend to mislead, I found they used out-of-date, blurry photos,' she adds.

Inspired
 by her uninspiring experiences, Saskia set out to put the online dating
 world to right with her company 'Saturday Night's Alright', a 
photography firm specialising in online dating profiles.

She
 left her job as a senior manager in a charity to study photography at 
Central St Martins art school before setting up her business in May last
 year.

Oh, I didn't notice you there!: Will online daters be attracted to the casual poses?

She now 
says she has over 200 clients and offers three different packages - a 
30-minute shoot with three images costing £80, an hour shoot and six 
images costing £140 and the whole shebang with ten images and a 
90-minute session for £210.

Considering
 research has found that 90 per cent of online dating decisions are made
 according to pictures rather than the written profile, it's not a bad 
investment for those looking for love.

When
 it comes to her dating photography Saskia has a clear ethos - to create
 images that have a natural but confident and happy feel.

'The
 idea is to create a set of photos that are of professional quality, but
 look as though they have been taken while they're out with their 
friends - by a friend with a good camera!

'I shoot outdoors and stay away from studios to avoid those embarrassing, naff studio shots which just don't work for dating.'

Saskia believes that an ideal profile image needs colour and personality, as in Miche's portrait, above

So who has are the Saturday Night's Alright clients? 'They're ready to take dating seriously
 and want to do everything they can to give themselves the best 
opportunity of finding a compatible partner. And I love knowing that I play a
 key role in helping them achieve that.

'I totally understand who my clients are and the journey they are on - and I think they value that.'

But
 not everyone on 'the journey' is keen to be given the professional 
finish.  'It's certainly not for me,' says 35-year-old lawyer Laura. 
'There's nothing less attractive than looking like you've made too much 
effort and even if they're casual '

But
 according to Saskia, clients often find their new profile pictures 
bring them dating success. One such singleton, Ollie, swears by his 
new-found dating image. 'It's already made a massive difference in a few
 days,' he says.

So given 
Saskia's expertise on the dating game, what's her advice for creating 
the perfect profile shot - whether it's a home snap or a professional?

'Most
 people aren’t impressed with out of focus, dark, dingy photos with 
messy backgrounds. It's not going to jump off the page and stand out. 
But my pet hate is when an ex is cropped out the picture. It's such a 
turn off.

'I
 love profile photos that are bright, well-lit, have pin-sharp focus and
 are colourful to help them stand out from the sea of dating photos on 
any dating site. 

'I
 also love a photo which tells people a little about the person’s 
personality. Clothes, make-up, hair style, accessories, props, the 
background and location all help with this and it just needs a little 
thought beforehand to get it right.'

The photographer adds, 'It’s also important that the person in 
the photo is looking confident, relaxed, happy and attractive - that 
goes such a long way to attracting people to your profile.'
