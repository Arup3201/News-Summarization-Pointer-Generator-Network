Scott Beecham had claimed he could not attend probation service appointments because he was unable to get out of bed after suffering a compressed disc in his spine

A thief who claimed to be bedridden with a bad back when he was in fact carrying out a seven month crime spree was caught out when he was seen swinging from a CCTV camera, a judge heard.

Scott Beecham had claimed he could not attend probation service appointments because he was unable to get out of bed after suffering a compressed disc in his spine.

But a court heard how at the same time, the 36-year-old was stealing thousands of pounds of stock from supermarkets.

The defendant, who appeared at Guildford Crown Court using crutches, was also fit enough to swing from a CCTV camera before punching it, the court heard.

Judge Peter Moss said he was left perplexed as to how Beecham could have carried out the offences after suffering such an injury.

During the spree the defendant, from Leatherhead, Surrey, targeted supermarkets and the DIY chain B&Q stealing or attempting to steal more than £2,000 worth of goods.

At the time he was in breach of a four week prison sentence, which had previously been suspended for two years.

Judge Moss heard Beecham had doctor’s notes stating he was unable to attend probation appointments because his ongoing health problems had left him bedridden.

The offences started on November 20 last year when he told a security guard in Sainsbury’s that he 'could have him with one punch'.

The intimidated guard, who knew the defendant was already banned from the store in Leatherhead, Surrey, called the police.

One month later Beecham approached the same security guard outside the supermarket and verbally threatened him.

On February 7 he threatened a store detective as he tried to steal £270 worth of video games from a Tesco store in Reigate, Surrey.

Beecham was then spotted attempting to steal eight X-Box consoles from Tesco in Weybridge, Surrey in March.

In April he stole three television sets from Asda, worth £970 pounds.

Scott Beecham admitted two offences under Section 4 of the Public Order Act, two counts of theft, criminal damage, common assault and breaching his suspended sentence at Guildford Crown Court (pictured)

Just weeks later the former painter and decorator targeted a Tesco store in Worthing, fleeing with £278 pounds worth of video games.

In June Beecham was witnessed jumping up and swinging off a CCTV camera at Tesco in Redhill before punching it. Also in June, he stole three power drills worth £449 pounds from B&Q.

Beecham admitted two offences under Section 4 of the Public Order Act, two counts of theft, criminal damage, common assault and breaching his suspended sentence.

Saul Herman, defending, claimed that Beecham had spiralled out of control after his ex-partner moved away with their children.

'At the time he was taking hard drugs that numbed the pain and made him more mobile,' he said.

On sentencing Beecham to 14 months and two weeks in prison, Judge Moss said: 'You were seen jumping up at a CCTV camera outside Tesco and hanging from it before punching it. That showed considerable agility for one suffering with a bad back.'
