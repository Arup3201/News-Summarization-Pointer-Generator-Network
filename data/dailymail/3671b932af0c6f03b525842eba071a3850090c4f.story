The family of a boy who killed himself after he was lured into a cyber blackmail plot have called for action against ‘poisonous’ social networking sites.

Daniel Perry, 17, was targeted by a gang who threatened to send compromising images of him to his family and friends unless he paid them.

He was also targeted by trolls on the controversial social networking site, Ask.fm, who urged him to kill himself in a disturbing echo of a recent spate of suicides by young people.

Blackmailed: Teenager Daniel Perry killed himself after he was trapped in an online blackmail plot

The apprentice mechanic jumped from the Forth Road Bridge in Scotland less than an hour after the gang told him he would be ‘better off dead’ if he did not comply.

Yesterday, his heartbroken mother said she was horrified by what had happened. His family demanded that Ask.fm be shut down and urged David Cameron to take action.

Daniel’s ex-girlfriend said that social networking sites such as Ask.fm were ‘poisonous’.

The Latvia-based website has been linked to the deaths of four teenagers, including 14-year-old Hannah Smith from Leicestershire. One anonymous tormentor told Daniel: ‘Kill yourself mate’, while another posted, ‘Please kill yourself’. A further message read: ‘You need to let a blade meet your throat.’

Daniel Perry was targeted by online blackmailers who told him they would hand a video to police of his chat with who he thought was a girl of his own age

Yesterday, his family revealed the teenager thought he had been speaking to a pretty girl his own age from Illinois. They say one of the gang pretended to be the girl during months of flirting. They then believe the gang used stolen images for a short video exchange during which they secured compromising images of Daniel.

It is believed to be a typed conversation on Skype with pictures being sent between the pair, according to a family member.

The images of the girl are likely to have been stolen and the footage of Daniel recorded afterwards. It is not believed a live exchange took place. The gang then revealed themselves in a menacing call also via Skype. They threatened to show the images to his family unless he paid up.

He was targeted by people who it is believed found his Skype address when he tweeted it

Shortly before his death, Daniel asked the blackmailers via his laptop: ‘What can I do to stop you showing this to my family?’ He was told to pay cash into a bank account or his life would not be worth living. He replied simply: ‘Bye’.

Daniel died in hospital on July 15. His mother, Nicola Perry, from Dunfermline, Fife, said: ‘They are clever people and I believe he didn’t give them any money, he was just scared and didn’t know what to do.

The teenager was an apprentice mechanic in Dunfermline, Fife, where he lived

‘On the night he died he walked out of his gran’s house at 7.30pm and texted me at 7.45pm to say he would be home soon but he never made it. I’m horrified about what’s happened, I still can’t go into his bedroom and I keep expecting him to walk through the door and say “ha, fooled you”.

‘Parents need to tell their children that nothing is that bad that it is worth taking your life over – anything can be fixed. We need to prevent this happening again.’

His uncle Ron Reilly, 47, said he went to Daniel’s bedroom on the night he died and found his laptop still on, with a picture of the girl on the screen. He added: ‘David Cameron needs to answer the question about web safety. There has to be some way that those people can be reported easily to the police and dealt with accordingly.

'These various websites named recently need to be shut down if they can’t be policed properly. How many other parents have lost their child like this and never known the reasons why? They’re scum – we want the people responsible to be found and prosecuted.’

Yesterday, Daniel’s ex-girlfriend Shannon Hughes, 17, said: ‘What happened to Daniel was horrific and I can’t believe people would write those things on Ask.fm. That is one website I would really like to see taken down – it’s poison.’

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We want to help parents and are working with industry to introduce more family-friendly internet filters.’

A spokesman for Skype said: ‘Bullying and harassment of any kind are not welcome on Skype and are taken very seriously. The safety of our users is paramount to us. We ask users to immediately report inappropriate behaviour through the “Report Abuse” button and encourage them to only share their Skype ID with people they already know.’
