Police have arrested two teenagers in the savage beating of 54-year-old 
white man left in a coma after he got out of his car to check on a young black boy he accidentally hit.

The two suspects, aged 16 and 17, were arrested in connection with the attack last week of beloved grandfather Steve Utash,
who was brutally beaten by an angry 
mob in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood after David Harris, 10, ran in
 front of his truck on a busy street.

Detroit police say about a dozen vigilantes beat Utash Wednesday, even stealing his wallet before leaving him injuries severe enough to cause bleeding on the brain - he is still in a medically induced coma.

News of the arrests came as donations passed the $100,000 mark on a webpage set up to raise money to pay for Utash's mounting hosptial bills.

The two arrested are expected to be arraigned Monday or Tuesday, a police spokesperson told MailOnline. Expected charges were not immediately available.

They were brought into custody Saturday morning by police without resistance from their homes with tips from the community, authorities told WXYZ.

Community group Detroit 300 was seen in a WJBK report canvassing the neighborhood door to door with flyers and pleas for help tracking down the additional assailants.

Detroit 300 joined police in saying there is no reason to suspect the attack was racially motivated.

'This is just an issue that happened, we're not going to put a racial component on it,' said one member of the 
group. 'These sort of things could have happened whether it would have 
been white on white, black on black, the fact of the matter is that it 
was wrong and it shouldn't have happened.

'This unprovoked attack on Steve is just inexcusable.'

News of the arrests was welcomed by a family member who spoke to WDIV.

'Happy, glad but now since the two dominos are going to fall, they're going to find out,' said brother-in-law Max Mohr. 'We want them all.'

It also came as the family says a GoFundMe page set up to help pay for the uninsured man's medical bills has raked in more than $111,000 - the goal was $50,000.

The family is grateful for the outpouring of generosity that has come from around the world.

'They're so appreciative that they don't really know how to take what the world is saying about this and their dad being the way he is,' Mohr added after saying that Utash's condition has not changed in days - there is still bleeding on his brain.

The donations and arrests are good news for a family that has found it hard to come by in recent days, and come as community leaders are rallying around the family with calls to end the random violence that plagues the blighted city.

'We’re a predominantly black church and Mr. Utash is white, but love is universal,' Reverend Maurice Rudd said during his Sunday sermon, according to the Detroit Free-Press. 'There are no boundaries to love. Love crosses all racial barriers, all levels of class.

'There is something in the spirit in southeast Michigan,' he continued. 'The spirit of violence... has infected our people.'

'Why are we so angry? What's wrong with us?' Reverend Larry Simmons shouted to his church during a Sunday sermon, according to the paper.

Simmons called on his flock to perform 'random acts of kindness' every day, and said 'we aren't going to be silent anymore... in the midst of all this anger.'

Rev. David Alexander Bullock echoed his thoughts across town during his Sunday sermon.

'It’s the responsibility of the faith community to engage those who are blind, in this case, a mob of young men who don’t see clearly, who flew into a rage... we can't stand idly by, we have to engage them.'

The calls came after another driver was beaten, this time to death, at a Detroit gas station.

Utash himself was left for dead by the angry mob.

'If it went on any longer, my dad wouldn’t be in the hospital right now, he would be in the morgue,' son Joseph Utash told CBS Detroit.

Security 
footage from a gas station Harris and friends were standing in front of 
shows him inexplicably running into oncoming traffic before being mowed 
down by Utash's vehicle.

Utash, from suburban Roseville,
 immediately stopped to check on the boy, but several black males from 
their late teens to their early 20s quickly descend on the scene.

Police quickly ruled the incident an accident.

'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' Moreno explained.

But what happened next is considered by Utash's family to be an act of retaliation.

Police
 tell MailOnline that about a dozen young males attacked the married 
father of three, beating him into a coma that he still hasn't woken from.

'It’s not like he hit the kid on purpose and they were trying to get revenge,' daughter Felicia Utash told WXYZ. 'He literally just tried to stop and help the kid and people came out of nowhere and tried to kill him.'

His son Joseph Utash hinted it might have been a setup to rob his father, perhaps even a hate crime.

'I
 think it was all a setup from the gate,' he told CBS Detroit. 'My dad’s
 been driving up and down Morang for 15, 16 years working for the same 
company... they know he has money and they robbed him.

'As far as a hate crime, it might be,' he continued. 'You go in Detroit and you’re white, you don’t belong.'

Police immediately dismissed the notion.

'We have no evidence to suggest it's a hate crime,' Moreno told MailOnline.

The
 boy's father was arrested after a background check revealed he has an 
active warrant, according to the Detroit Free-Press, but police declined to say if he would be charged in 
connection with the beating.

Witnesses said Utash immediately pulled over to check on Harris after hitting him.

‘David was laying right in front of the 
driveway and he had blood coming out of his mouth,’ James Duston Jr., 
the boy’s godfather told WXYZ.  He couldn’t move his body.’

The crowd ran towards the boy's screams and mercilessly beat Utash.

‘This little boy was screaming,’ a woman told the Free Press. ‘There was a lot of people that came out. It was crazy.’

All hell broke loose.

‘I think it lasted about one minute and 
then they let him go,’ a bystander told WXYZ. ‘And then they jumped back
 on him again and they did it about three times and finally someone was 
trying to help the guy that got beat up.’

‘He had the biggest gash on his head I 
ever seen – he was bleeding from the mouth and he was unconscious when I
 first got there,’ Debra Hughes told WWJ.

Harris suffered a broken leg, he has since been released from a local hospital, Moreno said. A message left with the family seeking further comment has not yet been returned.

‘It was sad because I knew the guy was getting out of his car to try and see what damage he did,’ the witness added.

‘He got his,’ another witness to the beating told the Free Press. ‘He got beat up real bad.’Both the driver and the boy were taken to a local hospital.

The boy’s family condemned the beating.

‘We don’t condone that at all,’ said Duston. ‘I told his mom and she just was like, no, we wouldn’t want that to happen.’

Doctors are still trying to determine if Utash will need surgery to save his life.
