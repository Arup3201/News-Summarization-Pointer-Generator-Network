Paedophile Jeremy Forrest is said to be facing an emotional ‘reunion’ with the schoolgirl he was jailed for running off to France with.

Forrest, 32, from Ringmer near Lewes, East Sussex, has not seen the girl, now 17, since he was jailed for five-and-a-half years in June last year for abducting her and having sex with a minor.

The maths teacher, who has previously insisted he is not a paedophile but simply fell in love with his pupil, triggered an international manhunt when he fled with the youngster across the English Channel.

Despite being tracked down by police and convicted of abducting the teenager, Forrest - who taught at Bishop Bell School in East Sussex - is now said to be keen to meet his former pupil and victim face-to-face.

Senior socials workers are said to be considering a ‘consultation period’ to decide whether the pair can meet at HMP Channings Wood in Devon, where Forrest is currently serving his sentence.

Officials have written to the Prison Service to enquire as to whether the pair can meet and to outline a plan should they be given the go ahead, The Mirror reported.

While it is unclear who initially suggested the meeting, both Forrest and the schoolgirl – who cannot be named for legal reasons – are aware of the proposal.

A source told the newspaper: ‘It is thought that such a meeting could give a lot of closure over the things that happened to them both.

‘It would only happen if both sides agreed and the girl was completely happy with it. There is absolutely no pressure from either side.’

It comes after Forrest was moved from Lewes Prison, East Sussex over 200 miles away to Channings Wood last August after the girl allegedly tried to contact him and obtain visitor rights.

It was reported at the time that the teenager managed to get a letter to Forrest and bombarded the governor with calls demanding to see him.

The schoolgirl was just 15 when she fled the country with Forrest, who left behind his wife and career, to start a new life together.

Forrest had groomed her from when she was one of his 14-year-old pupils, and after taking her virginity one week after her 15th birthday in his marital home, the pair left for France using the fake names of Jack Dean and Gemma Grant.

At first, the girl’s devastated family feared she had been kidnapped but soon after they fled the country, CCTV footage showed her with her arms around the teacher on board a ferry from Dover to Calais.

They were on the run for eight days before being found in Bordeaux where he was arrested in front of her.

He was convicted at Lewes Crown Court in June last year for child abduction and five counts of sexual activity with a child and jailed for five-and-a-half years.

It means the former teacher, who was ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for life, could be out on parole as early as next year.

Forrest and the schoolgirl have previously spoken of their plans to marry following his release.

After Forrest’s sentencing, the schoolgirl said: ‘I love Jeremy so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with him and maybe once he’s out, we can marry and have children.’

However, it is not known whether their plans were scuppered when news broke earlier this year that the teenager had started a relationship with a boy her own age.

In March it was reported that she had fallen for a 20-year-old PE teaching assistant and part-time security guard.

Because the girl is now 16 and the new teacher does not work at her current school, their relationship is not illegal.

While it is not known what Forrest made of the news, he is still said to have feelings for the schoolgirl.

In a recent letter he wrote to explain his feelings, he reportedly said: ‘The reason why contact is so vital to us is because of the support and stability our relationship gives our lives.’

Both Forrest and the schoolgirl and her family are said to have been informed of the proposal for them to meet, and a source close to his family said the request to do so had been ongoing for the last eight months.

Senior social workers are said to have written to HMP Channings Wood in Devon (above) to outline plans for a potential meeting between Forrest and the schoolgirl. Both parties are said to be aware of the proposed meet

‘If it is for the girl’s benefit and well-being, the Jeremy would like this meeting to happen,’ the source told The Mirror.

The teenager’s family refused to comment on the matter.

It is thought a case meeting between social workers and East Sussex Council will now be held in the coming weeks to make a final decision on whether the meeting can go ahead.

MailOnline has contacted East Sussex Council for comment.
