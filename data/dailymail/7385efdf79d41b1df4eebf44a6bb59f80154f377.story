Hero's rest: The ashes of Pearl Harbor survivor Lee Soucy have been interred on the USS Utah, his ship that sank during the attack and still rests in Pearl Harbor

The 70th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack which brought the U.S. into World War Two will take place today - at the exact moment the bombing began.

A large ceremony to remember the 2,390 Americans killed in the devastating attack by Japan will take place at 8am Hawaii time.

Pearl Harbor was hit by hundreds of Japanese fighters, bombers and torpedo planes launched in two waves from aircraft carriers.

Four of the eight U.S. Navy battleships at the base were sunk in the surprise assault, as well as several cruisers, destroyers and anti-aircraft ships.

The attack shocked the U.S. as Japan attempted to prevent the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with its plans in Southeast Asia.

The following day, December 8, the U.S. declared war on Japan after President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared the attack 'a date which will live in infamy'.

Previously, the U.S. had pursued a policy of isolationism and kept out of the war.

But instead of deterring the U.S. from stopping Japan's plans to expand its empire, the attack galvanised America behind the war and led, ultimately, to the two atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945.

Although tensions between Japan and the U.S. had increased and conflict was expected, most thought an attack would come in the Philippines rather than in Hawaii.

Most of the 12 ships that sank or were beached during the two-hour attack on December 7, 1941, have since been removed from the harbor, their metal hulls salvaged for scrap.

Only the USS Utah and the USS Arizona remain in the water.

Nearly half of those who died were onboard the battleship USS Arizona, which was sunk early in attack by torpedo bombers with the loss of 1,177 of its 1,400 crew.

Memorial: Mr Soucy's ceremony is one of five being held this week for servicemen who lived through the assault and want their remains placed in Pearl Harbor

Later service: A larger ceremony to remember all those who perished will be held this morning, just before 8 a.m. Hawaii time when the attack began

Pride: Eleven members of Mr Soucy's family, including his three children, several grandchildren and great-grandchildren, attended the sunset ceremony

Hero: A pharmacist mate, in 1941 Mr Soucy took care of the sick and wounded for two days straight following the December 7 attack

The USS Arizona Memorial, built over the remains of the ship, now forms a centrepiece of the World War Two Valor int he Pacific National Monument.

Veterans, relatives and dignitaries will bow their heads for a moment of silence at 7.55am local time - the time the attack began - as military jets soar overhead in a 'missing-man' formation.

Guided-missile destroyer USS Chung-Hoon will render a salute to the fallen crew of the Arizona, and more than 100 Pearl Harbor survivors - many of them in their late 80s - will end the morning service with a 'walk of honor'.

Inspired: Mr Soucy decided to have part of his ashes buried inside his former battleship after visiting Pearl Harbor for the 65th anniversary in 2006

Seven of the last known 18 survivors from USS Arizona will be present.

Mal Middlesworth, former president of the National Pearl Harbor Survivors' Association, estimates there are around 2,700 Pearl Harbor veterans still alive.

One of them, Lou Gore, describes being confronted by pandemonium after he rushed on deck as an 18-year-old during the attack.

He was confronted by flames shooting skyward, roiling clouds of dark, acrid smoke and swarms of fighter-bombers buzzing low overhead as he emerged on the deck of the USS Phoenix.

He said: 'We didn't know (at first) those were Japanese planes. We didn't know what was happening. I just did my job.'

The 88-year-old's vessel was anchored a short distance from a stretch of the harbor known as Battleship Row, where the Arizona was moored when it was hit.

Mr Gore said: 'I'll never forget watching the... USS Arizona battleship jumping up out of the water, landing and rolling on its side.

'There were bodies everywhere. Brooms floating in the water, canisters.

'I'm grateful to still be alive. So many lost their lives for no reason... I wish I had been able to save more.'

Veterans of the attack have been laid to rest in the wrecks of the ships they once served in or in the waters of the harbor.

This year, five memorials will be held for servicemen who lived through the assault and wanted their remains placed in Pearl Habor out of pride and affinity for those they left behind.

Among them was Lee Soucy, 90, whose ashes were taken in a small urn and placed in a porthole of his ship, the USS Utah, during a service yesterday.

Mr Soucy, the youngest of seven children, was a pharmacist's mate and was trained to care for the sick and wounded.

He had just finished his breakfast on that fated morning when he saw planes dropping bombs on airplane hangars.

Promise: The other half of Mr Soucy's remains will be laid to rest with his wife, as originally planned, at a church in Utah

Defense: Mr Soucy swam to shore during the attack and made a makeshift first aid center to help the wounded and dying as the USS Arizona went down

History: The ashes of three other survivors will be scattered in the harbor Wednesday morning

He rushed to his battle station after feeling the Utah lurch, but soon heard the call to abandon ship as the vessel began sinking.

Mr Soucy swam to shore, where he set up a makeshift first aid center to help the wounded and dying and worked straight through for two days.

The Utah lost nearly 60 men and around 50 of those are still entombed in the anti-aircraft ship.

Today, the rusting hill of the Utah sits on its side next to Ford Island - not far from where it sank 70 years ago.

Margaret Soucy, his daughter, said her parents had initially planned to have their ashes interred together at their church in Plainview, Texas.

But he changed his mind after visiting Pearl Harbor in for the 65th anniversary in 2006.

Later ceremony: An urn carrying the ashes of Vernon Olsen, who was among 334 on the Arizona to survive, will be interred in a gun turret on the vessel today

USS Arizona: Seen in 2002, the battleship rests beneath the sea, visible from above and to visitors who come to pay their respects to the 843 who died
on the battleship in 1941

USS Utah: The rusting battleship is seen off Ford Island, lost nearly 60 men, about 50 of whom are still entombed in the sunken battleship

She said: 'He announced that he wanted to be interred on the Utah. And my mother looked a little hurt and perplexed.

'And I said, "don't worry Daddy, I'll take that part of your ashes that was your mouth and I'll have those interred on the Utah".

'And you can then tell those that have preceded you, including those that were entombed, what's been going on in the world.

'And the rest of your remains we will put with mother in the church gardens at St. Mark's.

'And then my sister spoke up and said, "yes, then mother can finally rest in peace,"' she said.

Mr Soucy's three children, several grandchildren and great-grandchildren - 11 in total - attended the sunset ceremony yesterday.

Remains: All but two of the 12 ships that sank or were beached that day were removed from the harbor, their metal hulls salvaged for scrap

The remains of Vernon Olsen, who was among the 335 to survive the attack on the Arizona, will be interred in a gun turret on the ship this afternoon.

Mr Olsen died in April at the age of 91 after a bout of pneumonia.

Pearl Harbor internment and ash scattering ceremonies began in the late 1980s, and started growing in number as more survivors heard about them.

To date, 265 survivors of the attack have been buried or laid to rest there.
