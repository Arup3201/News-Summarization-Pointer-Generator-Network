Brazil defender Marquinhos has extended his contract with Paris Saint-Germain by one year until 2019, the French champions said on Thursday. 

The 20-year-old Marquinhos, who plays at centre back or full back, joined from AS Roma in 2013 on a five-year deal.

He had been a target for Manchester United as Louis van Gaal looks to bolster his defence, but this new deal will be a blow to the Dutchman. 

Marquinhos has extended his contract at PSG, saying he is happy to part of a 'magnificent' project

The Brazilian defender has become a key player for the Parisiens since signing from Roma in 2013

After putting pen to paper on the extension, Marquinhos said: 'I'm very honoured that I have been given this confidence, it is a new stage of my life. The project here is magnificent and life is beautiful in Paris!'

Nasser Al-Khelaifi, president of the club, said: 'Marquinhos is the future of this team, and the renewal of his contract is an important gesture that certifies his attachment to PSG. 

'We are very happy to have been able to extend by one year our adventure with this very talented man, which confirms our policy in tying down the best young people. 

'The biggest clubs in Europe following, this renewal consolidates and strengthens the new long term project of PSG '

The new deal will keep the 20-year-old in Paris until 2019, and should deter the likes of Manchester United
