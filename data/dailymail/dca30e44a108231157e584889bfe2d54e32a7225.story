Spain forward Fernando Torres has agreed to return to Atletico Madrid on loan from AC Milan until the end of the 2015-16 season, seven-and-a-half years after leaving his boyhood club.

Torres, 30, has been struggling for goals since leaving Liverpool for Chelsea in a then-British record £50million in 2011 and moved to Milan on loan in August.

However, the striker insisted that while it was 'time to go back home' he did not regret his career path since leaving Anfield.

Fernando Torres claims he does not regret his time at Chelsea and he won: 

FA Cup 2012

Champions League 2012

Europa League 2013 

But his goalscoring record does not look good:

Premier League: 20 goals in 110 games

Domestic cups: 7 goals in 19 games

European competitions: 19 goals in 43 games

Total: 46 goals in 172 games

‘Chelsea gave me what I was looking for when I left Liverpool... trophies,' said Torres in Dubai after Atletico confirmed the deal. 'I'll always see it as a success.’ 

Chelsea and Milan agreed on Saturday to make the switch permanent, paving the way for Torres to be loaned to Atletico, where he will hope to resurrect his stuttering career under inspirational coach Diego Simeone.

Simeone and Torres played together at the Spanish club between 2003 and 2005, when the young Torres captained the Argentine who will now be his manager. 

'At last back home. Thanks to all that have made this dream come true,' Torres wrote on his Twitter feed shortly after Atletico confirmed the deal under a giant 'Torres is back' banner on their website.

The deal is subject to Torres passing a medical and will be finalised on January 5 when the Italian transfer window opens, Atletico said.

'In this way, the forward from Fuenlabrada returns to his home where he was trained as a footballer and became one of their big stars,' the club added.

A World Cup and double European Championship winner with Spain, Torres joined Atletico at the age of 11.

Known as 'El Nino' (The Kid), he made his first-team debut as a 17-year-old in 2001, when Madrid's second club were in the second division, and was appointed captain two years later, becoming a huge favourite with the fans. 

The Spanish striker came through at Atletico as a teenager, becoming captain at the age of just 19

At Liverpool Torres was one of the best strikers in the world, scoring 65 Premier League goals in 91 starts

Since the move to Chelsea in January 2011 Torres has struggled for form and confidence in front of goal

Although he left the club in 2007, Fernando Torres is still Atletico Madrid's leading league scorer in the 21st century, ahead of four other Premier League stars:

1. Fernando Torres    75 goals in 174 games

2. Sergio Aguero        74 goals in 175 games

3. Diego Forlan           74 goals in 134 games

4. Falcao                      52 goals in 68 games

5. Diego Costa            43 goals in 94 games

When he left for Liverpool in July 2007, having scored 91 goals in 244 appearances, he pledged to return and could make his debut against holders Real Madrid in the first leg of a Copa del Rey last-16 tie on January 7.

As well as a decorated career with Spain, Torres helped Chelsea win the Champions League in 2012 and the Europa League a year later.

For one week in May 2013, Torres and compatriot and Chelsea team-mate Juan Mata were holders of the World Cup, European Championship, Champions League and Europa League titles.

However, his impact throughout his  career at Stamford Bridge was not as had been expected when he moved in January 2011.

His 46 goals in blue meant that each strike effectively cost Chelsea more than £1m. 

He has also struggled at Milan, scoring just once in 10 matches. 

Torres says he has no regrets over his move to Chelsea, where he won the Champions League in 2012
