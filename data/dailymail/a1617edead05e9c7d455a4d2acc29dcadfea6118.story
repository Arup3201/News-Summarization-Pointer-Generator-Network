A Florida woman who struck and killed a firefighter as he was changing a flat tire on the side of the road made a frantic 911 call begging the dispatcher to send help.

Lt Kevin Johns, 48, a 29-year veteran of the Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue, passed away from his injuries Tuesday after he was mowed down by Lorenza Simmons' car on Interstate 95.

Just moments after the deadly collision, a distraught Simmons dialed 911 telling the operator she had struck a man.

'I need an ambulance ASAP, please; I need police,' Simmons says on the newly released recording. I had a bad accident and my car got off the road and it hit a man. Please!

'He's breathing. Can you hear me, sir? Sir, can you hear me? He's breathing, but I need somebody here. Please hurry.’

Johns, a married father of three and a grandfather, was on his way to work at around 7am Tuesday when he pulled over on the side of the highway near Yamato Road to change a tire and was struck by Lorenza Simmons' white Hyundai Sonata.

Simmons told police that a Toyota RAV4 in front of her slowed down 'out of nowhere' and she swerved right to avoid a collision because her wheels locked up when she tried to hit the brakes.

Despite her efforts, Simmons plowed into the back of the SUV and then veered off to the side to avoid hitting Johns' car parked on the shoulder of the road, Local10 reported.

According to the woman, the firefighter suddenly emerged from behind his car and she slammed into him, the impact sending the 48-year-old man onto her windshield,

Speaking with WPBF reporters on the scene, Simmons said she stayed with the badly injured firefighter, made sure he was still breathing and tried to talk to him, but he only managed to say a few unintelligible words amid grunts of pain. 

'Oh my gosh, I need somebody here,' she can be heard crying during her 911 call. 'Please, take care of this man!’

Just before police and paramedics arrived on the scene, Simmons told the dispatcher: 'I can't believe I hit this man.'

Johns was rushed to Delray Medical Center, where he died six hours after the collision.

Catastrophic collision: The impact sent Johns flying onto the windshield of Simmons' white Hyundai 

Dozens of the firefighter’s colleagues came out to support him, forming an honor guard outside the hospital to conduct his flag-draped casket to the medical examiner's office in Palm Beach.

So far, no charges have been filed against Lorenza Simmons in connection to the accident.

Johns leaves behind his wife, Brenda, three children, ages 17, 20 and 28, and one grandchild. At the time of the crash he was only six months away from retirement.

Johns’ co-workers remembered him as the consummate professional who had an impeccable reputation within the department and the community.

‘He understood what it meant to be a firefighter, it was in his blood,’ Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler told the station WSVN.’ I mean, his father was a commander for our fire department for many years.’

Fort Lauderdale Deputy Fire Chief Timothy Heiser described the veteran firefighter as a leader and role model to his younger colleagues, and someone who led by example on the job and inspired confidence in his superiors.

Sun-Sentinel reported that Johns joined the force in 1986, following in the footsteps of his father, Commander Vernon Johns. He and his wife, whom he met in high school, also owned a day care center in their hometown of Jupiter.

Hesler added thatJohns had an outstanding record with the department, and that he was never even late for a shift in his 29 years serving at Fire Station 13.
