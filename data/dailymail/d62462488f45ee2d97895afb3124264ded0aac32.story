Missing: Michael Woodward is presumed to have been murdered by Pinochet men in 1973

For 40 years, Patricia Bennetts has been seeking justice for her brother who was tortured to death by the Chilean regime of General Pinochet.

Former British public school pupil Michael Woodward, a Roman Catholic priest, was seized soon after the dictator seized power in 1973.

He was tortured and beaten for ten days and eventually died on the Chilean navy ship Esmeralda – where many of the regime's opponents were systematically brutalised. His body was never found.

Finally this week, two men were found guilty of kidnapping Father Woodward and the Chilean government was ordered to pay compensation to his sister.

Chilean press reports state the government was ordered to pay £35million to Mrs Bennetts, but she said it was only £70,000.

The 75-year-old says she feels bitterly let down as the men, retired Chilean naval officers of low rank, were sentenced to just three years under house arrest.

She said: 'Someone, somewhere, knows where his body is and I will keep on trying to find it so that he can have the Christian burial he deserves.

'The two retired officers who have been convicted were not the ones in charge – the real culprits, those who gave the orders to torture and murder Michael, have not been prosecuted. The whole thing is a farce.'

She added: 'My brother died for his faith, the noblest of ideals, and I will not rest until there is justice.'

Father Woodward was born in South America in 1932 to a British father and Chilean mother, but went to Downside boarding school in Somerset before studying engineering at King's College, London.

In 1953 he returned to Chile to become a priest and, a world away from his privileged upbringing, went to live in a poor area of the coastal city of Valparaiso.

Mystery: Mr Woodward disappeared days after General Augusto Pinochet, pictured left in September 1973 in Santiago, took power in a military coup

Victory: Patricia Bennetts has spent the last 40 years fighting for justice for her brother Michael

Ten days after the 1973 coup in which 
the elected President Salvador Allende was deposed by General Pinochet, 
Father Woodward was arrested and taken to a detention centre where he 
was tortured in a swimming pool.

According to witnesses, he was then 
taken to the Naval War Academy where he was tied to a chair and beaten 
by torturers who wrapped their fists in damp towels to minimise 
tell-tale signs of bruising. There are also reports that his arms were 
broken with hammers.

He was eventually taken to the 
Esmeralda – a training vessel  which became a floating jail –where his 
ordeal continued until he died.

Mrs Bennetts, who lives with her husband in Madrid, has repeatedly returned to Chile to piece together the evidence.

Dozens of former naval officers were 
charged in 2008 in connection with the murder, but all but two of them 
were absolved due to insufficient evidence.

Jose Manuel Garcia Reyes and
Hector Palomino Lopez were this week convicted of kidnap.
