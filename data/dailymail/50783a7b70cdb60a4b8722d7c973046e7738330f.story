A formal investigation has been launched into the sinking of HMS Bounty - which went down in 18ft-high waves off the coast of North Carolina during Hurricane Sandy.

The probe will focus on the cause of the disaster on Monday - which claimed the life of at least one crew member, while the ship's captain, Robin Walbridge, is still missing.

The search for Mr Walbridge, 63, of St Petersburg, Florida, has been suspended following an extensive three-day search by coast guard ships, helicopters and aircraft.

'Suspending
 a search and rescue case is one of the hardest decisions we have to 
make,' said Captain Doug Cameron, the chief of incident response for the 
Coast Guard 5th District.

The Coast Guard rescued 14 crew member after they abandoned ship in two life 
rafts. Claudene Christian, 
42, was among those rescued, but she died.

An investigating officer will now receive evidence and testimony using formal rules and procedures, to try to get to the bottom of what happened, the Houston Chronicle reports.

The investigation will consider whether 
any failure of equipment or personnel contributed to Ms Christian's death. It will also determine if further investigation is needed. The probe  is expected to take several months.

HMS Bounty was originally built for the 1962 film 'Mutiny on the Bounty' starring Marlon Brando, and featured in several other films over the years, including one of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies.

Mr Walbridge was captain of the three-masted tall ship, which sank about 90 miles off Cape Hatteras.

Claudene Christian, 42, was among those rescued by coast guards, but she died.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Walbridge and Christian families,' Capt Cameron said.

The search persisted for days despite rough seas in the hope the expert seaman could stay alive in his survival suit in the relatively warm waters near the site of the shipwreck, the Coast Guard said.

The water temperature was 79 degrees on Thursday.

The original HMS Bounty became famous for a mutiny against its commander, William 
Bligh, in April 1789.

The mutiny was led by Fletcher Christian - an ancestor of 
Claudene Christian.

Mr Walbridge reportedly believed he could navigate the ship around Hurricane Sandy when the 
Bounty set sail last week from Connecticut. After two days in rough 
seas, he realised his journey would be far more difficult.

'Put crew in put into an extraordinarily hazardous situation': Captain Robin Walbridge (pictured) was never found after the sinking off North Carolina's Outer Banks, an ocean expanse with a history of shipwrecks

‘He's
 been in many storms,’ his wife Claudia McCann told PerthNow.com. ’He's 
been doing this a good portion of his life. He's been in lots of hairy 
situations and he's very familiar with the boat.’

'I
 think we are going to be into this for several days,' Mr Walbridge said
 in a message posted on Sunday on the vessel's Facebook site, which 
reads like a ship's log of its activities. 'We are just going to keep 
trying to go fast.'

By 
Monday morning, the vessel had started taking on water, its engines 
failed and the crew had to abandon ship as it went down in 18-foot 
waves.

By the time the 
first rescue helicopter arrived, all that was visible of the ship was a 
strobe light atop the vessel's submerged masts. The roiling Atlantic 
Ocean had claimed the rest.

‘He
 was a fantastic captain and he was the best in the industry,’ his wife 
described him among family and friends at their Florida home. ‘He had a 
reputation that followed him.'
