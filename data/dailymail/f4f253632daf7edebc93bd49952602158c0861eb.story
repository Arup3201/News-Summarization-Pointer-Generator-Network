A Laura Ashley boss worth £440 million has been ordered to pay his estranged former beauty queen wife £400,000 after he failed to persuade a judge that he has 'cash flow' problems.  

Lord Justice McFarlane today said it was 'very hard to understand' how someone of Khoo Kay Peng's wealth had 'cash flow difficulty' after he claimed he needed a month in order to borrow money and pay Pauline Chai. 

The couple, who were together for more than 40 years and have five children, have been locked in a bitter divorce battle for two years.

The judge was analysing the latest stage of the couple's money fight at a hearing in the Court of Appeal in London during which he was told that Dr Khoo owed Ms Chai around £400,000. 

He had been ordered to pay the amount to cover her living expenses and legal fees pending final decisions on money, but his lawyers claimed there was a 'cash flow' issue. 

Dr Khoo, 76, who is non-executive chairman of Laura Ashley Holdings, and Ms Chai, 68,  have been embroiled in litigation for around two years.

Ms Chai estimates that Dr Khoo is worth at least £440 million and says she should get half of that.

She also claims he has failed to give a 'proper account' of his assets, which Dr Khoo disputes.  

The former couple also cannot agree whether decisions about who should get what ought to be made in English or Malaysian courts, and litigation has been launched in both countries.

Dr Khoo, who is based in Malaysia, says the marital home was in Malaysia, and that Ms Chai wants to fight in England because an English court will give her a more generous award.

Ms Chai says they moved their home to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, before separating last year and therefore decisions should be made in an English court.

And she claims Dr Khoo is making a 'desperate attempt' to avoid fighting over money in an English court.

A number of judges have analysed the dispute at hearings in the Family Division of the High Court in London, and three Court of Appeal judges are due to consider the case at a hearing in July.

Lord Justice McFarlane today considered a number of preliminary legal issues prior to that hearing.

The judge was told that Dr Khoo owed Ms Chai around £400,000 he had been ordered to pay to cover her living expenses and legal fees pending final decisions on money.

A lawyer representing Dr Khoo accepted that the arrears 'must be paid' but said that was a 'cash flow issue'.

'We are talking about quite substantial sums,' said Timothy Scott QC. 'One way or another he has to borrow.'

He added: 'Some time will be needed for the formalities. The appropriate time would be 28 days.'

But  Lord Justice McFarlane ruled that the money should be paid in 14 days.

'It is very hard to understand how someone of the wealth of (Dr Khoo) has a cash flow difficulty,' said the judge.

'I am not at all persuaded that there is a cash flow difficulty.'

He added: 'The time has come to be absolutely plain ... These sums need to be paid.'
