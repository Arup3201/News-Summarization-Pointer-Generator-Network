ASBI family: Trudie Birch, 27, leaves the Birch family flat in Gloucester, where she, her parents, her sister and their boyfriends have been taken to court over their anti-social behaviour

A problem family taken to court after subjecting neighbours to a seven-year campaign of fighting, shouting, swearing and fly tipping insisted today 'we're not that bad' and called their many critics 'petty'.

The Birch family has been given a rare joint anti-social behaviour injunction - similar to an ASBO but aimed at problem housing tenants.

Michael Birch, 68, Jane Beard, 52, and their daughters Trudie, 27, and Ellen, 21, are now on a final warning to behave or face being kicked out of their home in Podsmead, Gloucester. 

To avoid further problems Robert Edward, 26, and Jonathan Ward, 25, who are dating the sisters, have also received injunctions banning them from the council flat.

But the family, who are also accused of window smashing and keeping problem pets, maintain they are the victims claim their neighbours are being 'petty'.

Retired Mr Birch said: 'We are not the troublesome family that we are being painted out to be. We have lived all over the city and we have had no problems like this before.

'I feel like when I go out people are looking out and saying 'there goes the family with the injunction order.

'The neighbours are just being petty. We keep ourselves to ourselves and we keep the noise to a minimum.'

Housing association Gloucester City Homes say the family has been time-consuming and expensive to deal with since moving into the property in 2008.

Gripes include arguing, foul language and physical fighting within the family home, where they have lived for seven years.

The anti-social behaviour has to stop or they will be evicted, council bosses say. 

They have also been told to get rid of three snakes, five bearded dragon lizards, and some goldfish but are allowed to keep six cats, a dog and a budgie.

Bad behaviour: The Birch family has been given a rare anti-social behaviour injunction - similar to an ASBO but aimed at problem housing tenants - for a long campaign of fighting, shouting, swearing and fly tippng

Mrs Beard, who claims disability allowance, accepted that there is sometimes a loud banging noise from the house but blamed her oxygen machine.

Senior anti-social behaviour officer Charlotte Newman said the family are a 'long-standing nuisance'.

'Our priority is to ensure our tenants and local residents are able to live peacefully in their homes,' she said.

'If this means that legal action is required to tackle those that behave anti-socially, then that is the action we will take.'

The injunction was obtained at Gloucester County Court on Friday and is believed to be the first of its kind to be issued anywhere in Britain in the last five years.

An ASBI is similar to the ASBO, but was developed specifically to help councils and housing associations tackle anti-social behaviour in social housing areas.

Gloucester City Councillor Jennie Dallimore, who lives in the Podsmead area of Gloucester with her husband and four children, said she endorsed the action taken against the family.

'I have known of this issue and this family for five years - there have been ongoing problems and intervention.

'This measure may seem extreme but everything has been tried.

'It has been devastating for those living around it. I have huge sympathy for people because it has been going on for such a long time.

'Podsmead is a great place to live and the area they live in is home to a lot of elderly people and it's unfortunate that this family have conducted themselves in the way they have, which is not acceptable.'  

Row: Despite their court case the Birch family maintain they're 'not that bad' and say neighbours and the council have been petty

An Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction (ASBI) is an order that prohibits a person or a family from engaging in housing-related anti-social conduct.

They were brought in by the Government in 2011 to speed up how long it can take to evict problem tenants. 

The order is similar to an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) but has been developed to help councils and housing associations tackle anti-social behaviour in social housing areas. 

The order can be used in a wider range of circumstances such as anti-social behaviour against hospital staff, shop staff, and  neighbours in the  rented sector.

The injunction requires the person who is committing anti-social behaviour to comply with rules such as not entering a specific zone, or not causing nuisance to residents.

They are issued by a county court and can range from six months to two years in length.

An injunction can be applied for by the police, a local authority, a housing provider, the British Transport Police Force, Transport for London, the Environment Agency or the NHS Business Services Authority.
