Funny guys: No the CIA does not know whether Tupac, pictured, is alive or where he is, so stop asking, it revealed in a tweet on Monday

No the CIA does not know whether Tupac is alive or where he is, so stop asking.

To mark its one month anniversary of joining Twitter Monday, the spy agency gave another display of its new-found humor by answering some of the more pressing questions its 668,000 followers have asked in the past 30 days.

No these weren't about al Qaeda, or intelligence about iPhone bombs, the CIA dished the dirt on rappers, passwords and whether you could score a job at the sort-after Virginia headquarters.

'No we don't know where Tupac is,' one of a stream of Twitter posts read Monday.

Another read: 'No, we don't know your password, so we can't send it to you. #sorrynotsorry'

The CIA then apologized for not following back Ellen DeGeneres, but added to the talkshow star, 'If you visit us maybe we can take a selfie?'

Another revealed that 'YES. We're hiring' for those keen to join the ranks. 

The CIA entered the Twittersphere last month in the tongue-in-cheek fashion that it has clearly upheld. Such an approach to public relations is rare for government departments or agencies, particularly the covert CIA.

The spy agency's first foray took the social network by storm as it poked fun at its secrecy.

'We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet,' the CIA tweeted.

The tweet was retweeted more than 300,000 times.

The CIA also launched its official Facebook page, which is more akin to the sober outlets of other government agencies.

Come join us: Another revealed that 'YES. We're hiring' for those keen to join the ranks.

Joining the social media world was intended to make the agency more accessible to the public.

On July Fourth, it had another interesting tweet. The spy agency helped solved what was a strange series of mysterious UFO sightings in Europe around the 1950s.

At the time Norwegians documented what they believed were alien spacecrafts soaring across the sky.

But thanks to one tweet, the CIA have explained exactly what was happening.

'Do you remember the reports of unusual activity in the sky in the 50's? That was us,' the Tweet said.

Attached
 to the tweet was a government writeup about the sightings, showing that
 they were actually test flights of U2 reconnaissance planes.

Makes sense: There were a series of UFO sightings in Norway in the 1950s. But with one post on Twitter, the CIA have explained them, saying they were merely testings of U-2 reconnaissance planes, such as the one pictured

The planes flew above 60,000 feet, which wasn't thought possible at the time, so commercial pilots who saw something so far above them couldn't explain it.

The effect was more pronounced at different times of the day and night, and if the U2 planes caught the rays of the sun, people on the ground were able to see silvery glints of light.

The explanation was kept classified for decades to keep the spy programme a secret from the Soviets during the Cold War, according to the BBC.

It is yet another tweet that caused a social media from the CIA since they joined Twitter.
