Two New York cops that plied an alleged rape victim with alcohol before one attempted to grope her, have admitted to wrongdoing but will get to keep their jobs.

The incident occurred when the two NYPD officers, Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, flew to Seattle, Washington, to interview an alleged rape victim in July 2013.

They ended up buying the 24-year-old rounds of drinks for nine hours, before Skorzewski took her back to their hotel, where he tried to tear off her clothes and grope her.

During the encounter he allegedly told her 'You're my favorite victim.'

Both policemen were hit with departmental charges after the unidentified woman's allegations made their way to the media.

The two officers pleaded guilty to the charges on Monday, The New York Daily News reported.

Skorzewski was demoted from detective after the trip, and was docked 30 vacation days and suspended for 10 days without pay as a result of pleading guilty.

He has been transferred to the Medical Division in Queens on a year's probation.

'What the detective did was immoral, certainly. It was wrong. But it wasn't criminal,' a police source told the Daily News.

Lamboy was already under investigation for overtime payments that he had not worked.

He pleaded guilty to that charge too and was ordered to pay back more than $5,000 for 76 hours.

For both charges he was docked 45 vacation days and suspended for 15 without pay. 

He has been transferred to Police Service Area 9 Viper in Flushing, Queens, a public housing unit.

Lamboy lost his command as head of the NYPD's Manhattan Special Victims Division. 

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton will have to approve the final punishment.

Sonia Ossorio, president of the National Organization for Women's New York City chapter, said in a statement: 'The idea of a special victims detective making a pass at a rape victim when he's charged with interviewing her about that rape shatters any notion of confidence in the NYPD's ability to regulate itself.'

'It's so far beyond the bounds of acceptability.'

The alleged victim said that on the day of the incident she had lunch with Skorzewski, a married father of two, at a Seattle restaurant called the Skillet Diner.

He spent time asking questions about her January 2013 rape case in which she alleges she was attacked by a man in a Union Square apartment in New York City.

She was then taken to the Pier 58 tourist area to meet his boss, Lamboy.

She told The New York Daily News: 'Looking back, it was totally naive of me to join them. But I was like, 'This is really cool.' I really looked up to them.'

'Luke was actually the one who said, 'I don't know if you're going to be able to come because we're going to be drinking.

'But when I dropped him off, the lieutenant was the one who said, 'Oh, no, you should stay, come on,' she recalled.

'I was going through this all alone. My family didn't know,' she said. 'It felt good that they were being so nice.'

They then went to Paddy Coyne's Irish Pub, but Skorzewski was so drunk that servers refused to give him any more alcohol.

Later, they headed to Cha Cha Lounge in Capitol Hill and then moved on to Unicorn, with the cops flashing their badges to cut the line.

She said that she attempted to leave at around midnight, but they begged her to stay. They even pleaded with her to call in sick to her job as a Starbucks barista the next morning.

She was drunk and unable to drive, so she went with them after they assured her that she would be safe if she stayed with them at their hotel. 

They  took her back to their hotel room at the Embassy Suites hotel in nearby Bellevue, Washington. 

Once there, Skorzewski loaned her some clothes and slept on the couch, she said.

But when they woke up with hangovers, Skorzewski climbed in bed with her as they watched TV and  asked to put his arm around her.

She claims he said: 'I really want to kiss you right now.' He also wanted to 'feel her up.'

She describes how he tried to work his way into her pants to tear them off but she pushed his hand away.

The next day, both policemen visited her at Starbucks and promised to stay in touch.

She said Skorzewski called her almost daily from New York for a month but the calls soon stopped, and she was 'crushed.' 

She quizzed him about why he had become distant in an e-mail but he became angry suggesting that she had screwed up his personal life.

She later saw Skorzewski in New York in October 2013 for a 'call' to the man who allegedly attacked her in January of that year. But the man was never charged.

Skorzewski soon stopped returning her calls altogether, so she  sent a letter to a family friend in the NYPD which led to a call from the Internal Affairs Bureau.

She told Internal affairs what happened and gave them evidence, including photos from the boozy night out, text messages and phone records which showed two-hour long calls with Skorzewski. 

Shortly after her claims were partially vindicated, Lamboy and Skorzewski were transferred from the elite Manhattan Special Victims Division.

Today, the woman, who is now now studying nursing at a Manhattan university, says she feels guilty that the detective might lose his job.
