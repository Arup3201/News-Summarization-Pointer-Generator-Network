Jerome Sinclair produced a match-winning performance for Liverpool's under 21s on Monday night as they defeated Chelsea 2-0, winning a penalty and scoring an eye-catching individual goal.

And his classy display drew high praise from an Anfield legend afterwards.

Jamie Carragher, who was summarising the match for Sky Sports, was very impressed by the teenager's abilities.

Talking about Sinclair's second-half strike, his 22nd of the season, Carragher said: 'It was an outstanding finish.

'He got the penalty [converted by Harry Wilson] and was maybe fortunate in the first-half but there he left them for dead.

'Centre-backs don't like being put in that position out wide. He has pace and composure on his weak foot. '

But who is the hotshot winning such high-profile admirers? Sportsmail has everything you need to know.

Name: Jerome Sinclair

Age: 18

Club: Liverpool

Position: Striker

Carragher certainly isn't the first pundit to notice the spectacular season Jerome Sinclair is having in Liverpool's academy teams.

Across the under 18, under 19 and under 21 age groups, the England youth international has found the net 22 times this campaign.

Chelsea, the defending champions in the under 21 league, were hoping to leapfrog a cluster of clubs and claim top spot as they headed to the Deva Stadium in Chester on Monday night.

But Sinclair and Liverpool had other ideas. After just eight minutes, Sinclair used his abundant pace to get in behind the Blues defence and was wrestled to the ground by Fikayo Tomori. Harry Wilson, another highly-rated player, converted the spot-kick.

Sinclair's unpredictable movement had been a headache all night and, shortly after half-time, he again burst past Tomori and finished high into the net from an acute angle.

It was the assured finish of a player in the best form of his life and someone well on the way to achieving his obvious potential.

This was just one example of the many types of goal Sinclair is capable of and a small glimpse into the buzz around a 18-year-old coaches at Anfield believe can become the next Raheem Sterling.

Sinclair already holds the distinction of being the youngest player to turn out for Liverpool, making his senior debut with a nine-minute cameo in a League Cup tie at West Brom in september 2012.

He was a tender 16 years and six days old.

Although that remains Sinclair's one and only senior outing, he has been making great strides at youth team and under 21 level.

Born in Birmingham in September 1996, Sinclair was a member of the West Brom academy between the ages of 10 and 14 before being spotted by former Liverpool club scout Stuart Webber.

He spent the 2011-2012 campaign mainly with the under 16 side but made a handful of appearances for the under 18 team towards the end.

His coach Mike Marsh was impressed by his talent and a 15-year-old Sinclair was even invited to rub shoulders with the likes of Carragher and Steven Gerrard at Melwood, something he later described as a 'great learning curve.'

It wasn't long before Sinclair found his scoring boots, with a prolific pre-season in 2012 leading to a call up into the squad Rodolfo Borrell was about to lead into the NextGen Series.

Sinclair impressed in the first group match away to Inter Milan, winning a penalty that Krisztian Adorjan converted and going close himself on a number of occasions.

Liverpool were narrowly beaten 3-2 in that game but went on to advance from the group, Sinclair scoring his first goal in continental competition in a 4-1 win over Rosenborg.

These appearances came either side of that first team run-out at The Hawthorns, a moment Sinclair described as a 'dream come true' in a later interview.

But things have really taken off for Sinclair this season, with six goals in the group phase of the under 19 UEFA Youth League amongst his haul.

The youngster has credited another club legend, Robbie Fowler, as a massive influence on his development with his coaching sessions at the club's Melwood training ground.

Sinclair told the Liverpool Echo last week: 'Robbie is a legend at this club so to get a few helpful tips from him and some advice is brilliant for me.

'This is a guy who has been there and done it and played at the pinnacle of the game. It's fantastic for me to get the chance to work with him and it can only improve my game.

'He has given me a few little tips on my first touch, and worked with me on different types of finishing. He is always there to help me in any way he can.' 

Internationally, Sinclair has represented England at under 16 and under 17 level. His debut came in the Victory Shield in October 2011, when Wales were beaten 4-0.

His first goals for the Three Lions came at the 2012 Montaigu Tournament in France, helping to secure wins against the hosts and also Morocco.

As shown of late, Sinclair is already a good finisher and has a knack of getting into the right place at the right time to gobble up loose balls.

He seems strong on both feet when in and around the penalty area and has good placement.

At 5ft 8in, Sinclair won't win a great deal in their air but he has tricky feet and good acceleration too, so he fits in with the fluid passing game the Liverpool academy try to foster.

And the signs look promising that Sinclair will be the next bright youngster to come through Liverpool's academy ranks.
