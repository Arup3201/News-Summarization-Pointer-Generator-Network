The mother of three young children found abandoned and locked inside a Washington home has admitted to using meth and told the court she is pregnant with a fifth child.

Amanda Foley and Mark Dorson, both 33, were arrested this week after their children were found on Saturday alone locked in a filthy run-down Lake Stevens house, starving and shivering in 40-degree temperatures.

The children, aged seven, three, and 11 months, were living 'among animal feces and human excrement', according to court documents.

Police said that when they entered the home, they were overwhelmed by a strong smell of ammonia, according to King 5. 

The infant had had a temperature of 94.1 degrees and was found to be suffering from hypothermia and dehydration, court documents said. 

He was 'in the 2 per cent for his body weight'. 

Foley broke down in court on Wednesday when a judge told her she would have no contact with her kids. 

The parents appeared in Snohomish County, Washington Court where a judge ordered them held on a $100,000 bond for charges of felony criminal mistreatment and abandoning a child.  

Becky Hensley, the stepmother of Foley's oldest daughter, who didn't live in the home, told King 5 that the mother 'should be crying'. 

Hensley, a mother of five, said Foley would call her eldest daughter once every three months. 

The couples' children were saved from the deplorable conditions after a woman stopped by the family's house in Lake Stevens to collect a debt from Dorson.

When she found the couple's seven-year-old daughter and three-year-old son unattended in the downstairs portion of the house, she called police. 

Officers who arrived on the scene found the sister and brother huddled together under a blanket on a couch to keep warm in the unheated home, surrounded by garbage, according to a police affidavit.

'The condition of the home looked like it was being torn down, with drywall missing, insulation missing, water coming through the ceiling,' Lake Stevens Commander Dennis Taylor told KOMO.

'There was only an empty snack-size potato chip bag and an empty Pringles can. There was no sign of any food; no empty wrappers, no empty cans, certainly no food in the home,' Cmdr Taylor added. 

Police were eventually able to coax the girl to open the door, and she insisted that her parents were upstairs sleeping.  

While police didn't find the parents upstairs, they did discover the couple's 11-month-old son in a bedroom - which was locked and unreachable by the two older siblings.

While all three children appeared to be malnourished and struggling to keep warm in the unheated house, it was the infant who was in the worst condition according to police reports.

Cold: The 7-year-old girl and 3-year-old boy were found huddled under a blanket on the couch to keep warm in the unheated home. Animal feces and other trash were found littering the home 

The baby barely reacted to touch when officers arrived on the scene, and after being rushed to the hospital, doctors pronounced that the boy was suffering from hypothermia and dehydration.

Thankfully, the boy reacted well to treatment 'and is doing much better now' according to Cmdr Taylor.

The two other children were also treated at the hospital, and the siblings have now been placed in foster care. 

'If it weren't for the person who was owed money; if it weren't for their insight to call us, we'd be dealing with a much more tragic situation,' Cmdr Taylor said. 'It's 40 degrees inside the home because there's no heat; no insulation. It's very possible the one child could have perished from hypothermia.'

It’s still unclear how long the three children were left alone at the home, or if their parents had returned to the home since going missing.

However, the couple never attempted to contact authorities and it took until Tuesday for police to track them down and arrest them at a business in nearby Monroe, Washington - about 30 minutes south.

Authorities say the parents have been investigated by Child Protective Services on several occasions in the past, when their eldest daughter continually showed up unkempt and hungry to school. 

Her school had also informed CPS when she failed to show up for school for a week straight. 

There were concerns about the girl's 'health and well-being, her attendance, her hygiene,' Jayme Taylor, director of communications for the Lake Stevens School District told King 5.

She added that the school noticed she smelled so badly that she was offered a change of clothes by staff. 

Shellie Cooper, the mother of a friend of Dorson, called CPS 18 months ago after her son saw the conditions of the house.  

Cooper said the kids 'weren't being fed' and were 'locked in their rooms'. 

However, neighbors were completely unaware that the children were being left alone or the state that the house was in. 

They did, however, confront Dorson about the condition of the exterior of the home when it started to stick out in the community. 

Criminal history: Dorson and Foley both have extensive criminal records. Dorson was sentenced to prison in 2002 for shooting and wounding a man while Foley was convicted of stealing an SUV

'He pretty much threw attitude, and said he was doing the best he could. And we said "OK, well, it needs to be taken care of,"' Neighbor Matt Eberharter told KIRO.

The stench in the house was so bad that investigators had to don respirators and plastic boots to look over the home a few days later, and a building inspector has now condemned the house as uninhabitable. 

While there was running water in the home, inspectors also found mold and water damage, in addition to dangerously disabled smoke alarms, exposed wires and uncovered light fixtures. 

According to court records, both parents have had several run-ins with the law. 

Dorson was sentenced to prison in 2002 for shooting and wounding a man, while Foley graduated from drug court in 2009 and was later convicted of stealing an SUV.

The woman who discovered the children living in the filthy conditions on Saturday says she paid Dorson for car repairs that he never followed through with. 

Dorson's Facebook shows him working to upgrade several cars, many of them parked outside the home where he allegedly abandoned his children.
