Thief: Building society cashier Adrienne Wells, 23, has been jailed after stealing from elderly savers 

A crooked cashier who stole £40,000 from pensioners' savings has been jailed after she was exposed by two victims in their 90s.

Adrienne Wells hoped her victims would think they had 'lost their marbles' and spent the money - which is what two of them, aged 94 and 96, said they were told when they alerted building society staff.

But the elderly pair refused to back down, and Wells was eventually brought to justice with her cocaine and drink habit exposed.

The 23-year-old stole £40,000 from the accounts of five Derbyshire Building Society customers between May and November 2013, Derby Crown Court heard. 

She looked for the savings of people who rarely withdrew money, suggesting they had forgotten about them.

That was until sharp-eyed Doris Cash, 94, spotted £20,000 missing from her account.

She knew she had not spent the money because it was set aside for her funeral.

Although the retired barmaid used a wheelchair, she insisted on being taken to a branch near her Derby home to question the withdrawal.

Ms Cash has since died but her nephew Philip Elmore, 61, said the building society 'kept insisting' his aunt had withdrawn the money.

'This woman did a lot of harm and will be inside for six months but if you asked people if they would do six months in prison for £40,000, they would queue up,' he added.

'It'll be like going into a holiday camp.'

He said he did not blame his aunt's death on Wells' thefts but said 'it didn't help'. He added: 'It was always on her mind and she went into hospital three times.'

Jim Hunt, a 96-year-old widower, also saw £2,200 was missing when he received an annual statement in March 2014 - but said staff denied responsibility to him too.

'They claimed I had lost my marbles and that I'd spent it,' he said. 'I could not understand how this had happened because I had my paying-in books at home.

'I didn't even know you could withdraw money from a building society without the books.

'I was not very happy at all when they kept saying I had lost my marbles and spent it.

'They kept saying to my daughter that she needed to jog my memory.

'But they were just messing about and keeping it hush-hush until they finally came out and said where it had gone.'

Mr Hunt's daughter, Lois Hunt, 60, a nurse, said: 'The building society were basically saying he was gaga and didn't know he had the money.

'But this was the work of a despicable young woman in a position of trust, taking advantage of the elderly and vulnerable.'

Wells, of Holbrook, Derbyshire was jailed for 12 months yesterday for taking a total of £40,000 from customers' accounts. She will spend half the sentence in prison.

The court heard she had no assets to her name but claimed to have given £3,000 to her boyfriend. Police asked him for a statement on this but he failed to make one.

Wells also claimed to have handed more than £6,000 to a village pub.

This has now closed and the former landlady said it was a £1,000 loan which had been repaid.

Other enquiries had been made into all Wells' cash claims but Judge Ebrahim Mooncey said: 'That still remains a mystery.'

The court heard she had spent thousands of pounds of the money 'on drink and drugs'. 

Quentin Robbins, in mitigation, said Wells was in the grip of cocaine and alcohol at the time but was now clear of both drugs.

He added: 'She realises the hurt and distress she has caused as a result of her offending.' 

The Derbyshire Building Society was bought out last year and is now part of Nationwide.

A spokesman said: 'Employee fraud is extremely rare, but where it does happen, we take it very seriously, treating victims fairly and ensuring that those affected are not financially disadvantaged.

'In this particular case, we took action as soon as we were alerted to the situation.

'The suggestion that our branch staff were not taking customer concerns seriously is not a behaviour we recognise amongst our employees who pride themselves on excellent customer service.

'We have a policy in place for the management of vulnerable customers who have the potential to become victims of financial crime and this is regularly communicated to our employees.'
