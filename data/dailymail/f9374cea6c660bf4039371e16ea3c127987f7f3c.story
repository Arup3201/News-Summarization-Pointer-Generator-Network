Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf has had to pull a campaign ad after it emerged that the actor vouching for his stint in the Peace Corps also appeared in a cannibal fetish film.

Democrat Tom Wolf's advertisement featured Alan Benyak, 50, sitting on the hood of a Jeep and talking about Wolf's time in India.

Benyak has many strings in his bow - he's an attorney who was a Democratic candidate for judge in Washington County, he served in the U.S. Army - and he's something of an actor.

Campaign ad: Alan Benyak appears in gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf's ad touting the Democrat's Peace Corps experience in India

Interesting role: Benyak also played a character called Mr Cannibal in a 2013 'torture porn' film called Breeding Farm about a farmer who kidnaps women and forces them to breed

However, his previous acting work differs wildly from the wholesome campaign ad for Wolf.

In 2013, Benyak played Mr Cannibal in a film 'torture porn' film called Breeding Farm.

IMDB decribes the film: 'After a night of partying, four friends are kidnapped by a mysterious man. The friends wake up in a basement, and realize they are part of something horrifying. A human breeding farm. They are to be milked, bred, and much, much worse.'

BuzzFeed reports that the film features Benyak 'torturing a half-naked woman, buying a woman, force-feeding a woman, engaging in cannibalism and inspecting a woman as if she is livestock.'

In other parts of the film, women are milked, beaten, raped and ridden.

'The campaign was unaware of Mr Benyak's involvement in the film, and we are making changes to the ad overall,' Jeff Sheridan, Wolf's press secretary told the Tribune.

The film was directed by Cody Knotts, himself a Republican who twice ran for state House and lost.

He alerted the public to Wolf's campaign ad's actor with a couple of tweets.

'I much prefer Benyak's performance in this video than the Tom Wolf one,' he wrote, adding a link to his film.

Benyak is also the star of another unorthodox film, titled Lucifer's Unholy Desire.

'A young woman possessed by a demonic succubus; who then causes the death and destruction of the people around her through their deepest and darkest desires,' reads an IMDB synopsis.

'An exorcist is then called in to to try to bring an end to the mayhem and save the girl from evil's grasp before the demon can lead everyone around her to hell.' 

Out of the bag: The director of Breeding Farm, Cody Knotts, posted this tweet 

Party lines: Knotts, a Republican who twice ran for state House and lost, also posted this tweet

According to a 2013 article in the Herald Standard, Benyak serves as legal counsel to the Mon Valley Police Association and the Municipal Authority of Belle Vernon. He is also a board member and officer of Donora Public Library.

Press secretary for the Republican Governors Association quickly used the information against Tom Wolf.

'If Tom Wolf doesn't know who he is featuring in his ads to speak for his campaign, how can voters trust him to make the right decisions for Pennsylvania?' asked Jon Thompson.

'Unfortunately, I have become political fodder in a game of high-stakes politics due to a small role I played in a low budget film as a favor to a friend struggling to fulfill his own dreams,' Benyak wrote in an email to the Tribune.

'I'm a veteran, a small business owner, and I'm active in my community. If helping friends in need is what I'm charged with, then I am guilty, and I won't apologize for it.'
