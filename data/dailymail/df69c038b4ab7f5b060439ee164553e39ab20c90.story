Details have emerged how a rowdy bar-room brawl with fists flying, broke out in one of the country's most exclusive fitness clubs - allegedly because of a girl.

It's almost two years since the fight which began in the 'Tap Room' bar of the New York Athletic Club.

The melee resulted in the arrest of three men, with two reported broken noses and ten police being called to cart off the angry fitness enthusiasts.

New court papers reveal a blow-by-blow account of the fisticuffs.between a Manhattan salesman victim Andrew Haesler, 50, and two other members.

Exclusive: A Manhattan salesman whose eye socket was fractured in a boozy brawl at the staid New York Athletic Club two years ago has filed a blow-by-blow account of the fisticuffs

Mr Haesler insists that he was not initially involved when punches started flying.

Witnesses claimed the scene was more like
 the Lower East side of Manhattan at 3am than a Central Park society 
that costs $8,500 to join.

Haesler's eye socket was fractured in a boozy bust-up, but in his lawsuit he insists that he and a pal were just trying to break things up between Wall Streeters Peter Doran, 29, of Glen Head, Long Island, and Colin Drowica, 31, of Manhattan.

Soon after the event, the Wall Street Jackass blog went into great detail over what happened in the posh club.

The witness wrote: ‘It was the best fight I've ever seen. Young people, old people, girls, members, non-members, it was a nondiscriminatory ragematch’.'Not sure the reason but it seemed to be over a girl.

'Anyway, probably two broken noses 
right off the back, one dude knocked straight on his butt on the first 
punch, glasses thrown, broken glass everywhere , and all the tables 
turned over or shoved to the side, they were making their arena.

'The
 commotion ended so everyone thought ,  until somebody knocked the guy's
 girlfriend over and this kid laid one dude right out.

'Girl
 got knocked over again ......Second stoppage occurred after a good five
 minutes when Luis the bartender joined forces to come in and stop it.  
BIG MISTAKE , Luis fell like a bag of sand after a fairly aggressive 
push and he started screaming 'Call nine eleven.'

The court papers filed by Haesler, some of which have been published in the New York Post seem to corroborate such allegations.

'Defendant
 Doran was involved in an initial attack on a bar patron, which Mr. 
Haesler and his friend attempted to defuse,' the papers say.

When Haesler tried to pull the men apart, the brokers both took shots at him, cracking his eye socket.

'Defendant
 Drowica punched me in the face, fracturing my right orbital bone,' 
Haesler says in an affidavit attached to papers filed at Manhattan 
Supreme Court. 'I was removed from the area of the fight by friends,' he
 adds.

But that was just the
 start. As he was walking out, he saw the attackers pouncing on a pal of
 his, and tried to pull them off, he says.

'When he heard me approaching, [Doran] turned to face me and punched me in the temple,' he says.

'Afterward,
 defendant Doran repeatedly threw punches up at Mr. Haesler before the 
police arrived to stop the attackers,' the papers say.

Doran and Drowica, a director at Knight Capital, have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault.

Doran has stated that he may have hit other bar patrons, but never hit Haesler. That's not something Haesler agrees with.

'The
 only rationale to explain how he could do so in a sworn statement is 
that he has no memory of the night due to his intoxication,' Haesler 
says in court papers.

In a 
letter to members, club president S. Colin Neill said: 'I cannot state 
forcefully enough how abhorrent this event it to me, personally, and how
 contrary it is to the standards of decorum that we expect of our 
members and their guests'.

The
 letter goes on: 'Appropriate action is being taken against all of those
 involved. Such conduct will not be tolerated at the New York Athletic 
Club'.

NYAC was founded in 1868, and boasts 231 Olympic medals won by its members - 120 of them gold, according to the club's website.
