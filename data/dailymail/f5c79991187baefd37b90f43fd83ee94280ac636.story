Residents living in a luxury apartment block will not have to go too far to enjoy a little greenery - after a garden was attached to the outside of the building.

The block, in Central Park, Sydney, is home to the world's tallest 'vertical garden' - a living tapestry of plants, flowers and vines stretching 500ft high.

The two dozen green wall panels that cover the building, some as high as 16-storeys, have been filled with over 100,000 plants.

Garden in the sky: This building in central Sydney is home to the world's tallest 'vertical garden' - a living tapestry of plants, flowers and vines stretching 500ft high

Unusual: The two dozen green wall panels that cover the building are as high as 16-storeys and hold over 100,000 plants

The eye-catching installation was 
designed by French botanist Patrick Blanc in collaboration with Paris-based 
architects Ateliers Jean Nouvel.

In
addition, residents on levels 29 to 33 of the complex's east tower have 
their own cantilevered 'Sky Garden' that juts from the facade.

All
of the plants and flowers in the vertical gardens are carefully 
maintained by a special hydroponic system, which automatically waters them.

Mr Blanc specialises in plants from 
tropical forests and is known as the modern innovator of 'green 
wall' vertical gardens.

Vertical gardens are believed to have been invented by Professor Stanley Hart White at the University of Illinois in 1938.

But Mr Blanc is credited by some with helping to modernise and develop the style.
