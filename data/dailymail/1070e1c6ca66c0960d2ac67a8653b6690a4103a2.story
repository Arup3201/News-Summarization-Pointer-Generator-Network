Police say a 21-year-old man suspected of participating in an illegal street race that killed two spectators in Southern California has been booked on suspicion of murder.

Henry Gevorgyan turned himself in on Saturday night accompanied by his lawyer. Jail records show he’s being held on $2 million bail.

The Los Angeles Police Department said Gevorgyan fled the scene of the deadly accident in the San Fernando Valley last week. 

Authorities said he was driving a souped-up Ford Mustang that veered out of control and crashed into a crowd on the sidewalk.

Henry Gevorgyan, 21, turned himself into the Los Angeles police after they suspected him of driving his Mustang into a crowd of onlookers, allegedly killing two

A souped-up car that was illegally street racing lost control and veered on to a sidewalk, killing two spectators and critically injuring another before the driver ran away at about 2.15am on Thursday, police said

Two cars were reportedly involved in the accident, police said. This is one of the two cars that was crushed after the planned early-morning race

Spectators Eric Siguenza, 26, and Wilson Wong, 50, were killed, according to ABC 7. A third man was hospitalized with serious injuries.

Police said Gevorgyan could face murder charges.

'We are pursuing murder charges against the driver of one of the vehicles and continue to investigate the role and responsibility of the other,' McMahon told the Los Angeles Daily News on Thursday. 

The motorist of a second vehicle also allegedly fled the scene. Police did not have immediate information as to whether the driver had been identified or apprehended, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Car skid marks covered the pavement along a street in the Chatsworth section of Los Angeles the day after the incident

A crisis response team surveys skid marks at the drag racing scene on Thursday. Though it's in a commercial area, the street has been used for illegal nighttime races for quite some time

The street where the incident happened, in a commercial and office area that is mainly deserted after dark, has long been the scene for illegal nighttime street races. 

City Councilman Mitch Englander told the Daily News that he'll introduce an ordinance allowing police to seize cars involved in street racing or reckless driving resulting in serious injury or death.

McMahon told CNN that people should be aware that street racing is a dangerous activity.  

'Many view this as an entertainment, glamorous activity. I think it's important for the public to know that this is illegal, dangerous and an all too deadly activity,' he said.

Though Gevorgyan turned himself in, police are still searching for a second suspect who was allegedly involved in the street race
