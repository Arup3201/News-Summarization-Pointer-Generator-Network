There will be no new inquiry into the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings that claimed 21 lives and injured a further 182 people.

West Midlands Police today announced that an 18-month
 re-examination of the evidence had not revealed any new leads on the attacks.

However, Chris Sims, the force's chief constable, insisted the investigation was still open.

21 people were killed and a further 182 injured in the blasts at two Birmingham city centre pubs in 1974

No one has been brought to justice for the atrocity, which saw bombs explode at the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town pubs on November 21, 1974.

Mr Sims posted a statement on the West Midlands Police website after meeting with relatives of two of the people who died in the blasts.

It read: 'Nothing would give me more satisfaction than to bring those responsible for this atrocity to justice. However we have found no new evidence that would assist us in bringing anyone to justice for the pub bombings.

'I have been able to share with these families further details regarding the tragic events of that night. I am sorry that families were not kept up to date or engaged with as is standard practice today. Forty years ago was a different era and a different force.

'However, I make this pledge today - I would like to offer families of those who died or people who were hurt on the night to be given as much information as possible to answer the questions that we can. I would ask them to contact us so we can start that process.

'It is always possible that brand new and significant information could become available to us - let me be clear - this case is not closed.'

Mr Sims said a reassessment of evidence by West Midlands counter terrorism unit, which began in June 2012, had collated and preserved around 18,500 items including information from the 1974 and 1991-1994 investigations. More than 9,000 items had required assessment, he said.

He added that the police have also commissioned an independent review of the potential forensic evidence.

'There have been questions over the years why certain individuals such as the people named by the media apparently never formed part of any investigation,' he said.

'I want to be open and transparent today and tell you that these men had been subject to investigation in the 1970s and the 1991-94 investigation. There was insufficient evidence for proceedings against any person.'

Six men were jailed for the bombings in 1975. The Birmingham Six, as they became known, spent 16 years in prison before their convictions were quashed in 1991.
