The U.S. start-up which wants to make 3D-printable firearm blueprints available for free online has received a license to allow it to make and sell guns.

Cody Wilson, founder and figurehead of Defense Distributed, posted a picture of the Type 7 Federal Firearms License (FFL) on the group's Facebook page.

A note attached to the picture read: 'Look who now has a license to manufacture firearms! The work begins!'

The license granted by the U.S. agency of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms now gives Mr Wilson government approval to make and distribute guns.

Mr Wilson told Ars Technica: 'The big thing it allows me to do is that it makes me manufacture under the law—everything that manufacturers are allowed to do.

'I can sell some of the pieces that we've been making. I can do firearms transactions and transport.'

Defense Distributed has already made several prototypes of 3D-printable gun parts, including for the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which is allowed under U.S. law without a license.

The group has made its blueprints available as free downloads via its own distribution website after other 3D printing websites decided to remove the files.

However, the new license allows Mr Wilson to make and distribute actual finished firearms.

The Texas-based law student, who Wired
magazine last year described as one of the 15 most dangerous people in 
the world, told Ars Technica that he had applied to the ATF for his Type
7 license in October 2012.

Applications for the licenses usually take around 60 days, but Mr Wilson's took a whole six months to come through.

Defense
Distributed's aim, according to its website, is to extend the rights to
bear arms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment to the
entire world.

'The work begins': Mr Wilson posted this picture of his recently granted Type 7 Federal Firearms License on the Defense Distributed Facebook page

Since beginning operations last year, the group has, perhaps unsurprisingly, had to overcome range of legal problems and moral objections which threatened to derail their project.

They have had their blueprints removed from CAD-file search engine Thingiverse, their account on a crowd-funding website frozen and funds returned to donors, and companies from which they planned to lease equipment repossessing their printers.

Two Texas-based companies, whose names are not known, have since volunteered space and a 3D printer for the team to carry out manufacturing and ballistics testing.

Mr Wilson said he will not actually start making and selling guns until he receives an 'add-on' to his license which will allow him to deal in a broader range of firearms, including fully automatic weapons.

With that permission in place, he hopes to beginning selling guns to offset the costs of the Defense Distributed project.
