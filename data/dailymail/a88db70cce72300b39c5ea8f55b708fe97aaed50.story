With his close-cropped hair and trademark pencil behind one ear, he hardly looks like the typical home baker.

But builder Richard Burr is set to become the unlikely third male winner of The Great British Bake Off next week.

The 38-year-old father-of-two was named star baker for the fifth time on last night’s semi-final, meaning he is now the bookies’ favourite to win the show.

Next winner? The builder, pictured in last night's episode with fellow contestants Luis, Nancy and Chetna, who was later voted off, was voted star baker for the fifth time - meaning he has won half the episodes

The latest episode saw the four remaining contestants battle to make the best baklava, German schichttorte and French entremets.

For the baklava, they were asked to make their own filo pastry, despite the fact Mary Berry has admitted she and fellow judge Paul Hollywood always use the ready-made variety.

Mr Burr – who has won a loyal following of fans thanks in part to his habit of wearing a pencil behind one ear – quickly impressed the judges with his meticulously planned efforts.

He was voted star baker for the fifth time, meaning he has now won half of the episodes.

Meanwhile, his rival Chetna Makan, 35, struggled to cope with this week’s tasks and was voted off.

According to Ladbrokes, Mr Butt, who runs the family building business in London, is now 2/1 favourite to win this year’s Bake Off, with Luis Troyano, 42, at 4/1 and 60-year-old Nancy Birtwhistle at a distant 10/1.

If he does win, it means male contestants will have the edge over women on Bake Off.

Talent: Some of the delicious and delicate bakes that Mr Burr presented on last night's episode. Off the four previous Bake Off winners, two have been men, and two have been women

Of the four previous Bake Off winners, two – Edd Kimber and John Whaite – have been men, and two – Joanne Wheatley and Frances Quinn – have been women.

Earlier this week, Mr Burr said he felt he had demonstrated men were just as good as baking as women.

He said: ‘I hope we’ve turned over some stereotypes. Builders aren’t particularly known for their cooking abilities, but I think more fellas should bake.

‘Bread’s easy, it’s only four ingredients, and even if you make it badly people are appreciative.’

He also revealed the only reason he entered the BBC1 show was because he was hung over, and agreed to let his wife fill in the application so she would leave him in peace.

He said: ‘I applied for the show on New year’s Day. I’d made all the cakes for Christmas, plus a Christmas pudding, a big gingerbread house and all the trimmings.

‘My wife Sarah said I should do it, and because I had such a hangover on New Year’s Day I agreed for a bit of peace and quiet.

‘I left Sarah to do the writing. Next thing I knew I had the production company phoning me up.’
