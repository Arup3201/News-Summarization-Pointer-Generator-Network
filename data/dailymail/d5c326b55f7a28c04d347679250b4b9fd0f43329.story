A drunken bus driver crashed a double-decker into a line of parked cars following a night of heavy drinking.

Passengers were astonished when the bus, driven by Steven Derrick, smashed into a Mini Cooper after weaving from side-to-side on a street lined with vehicles.

When the 24-year-old from Bristol was arrested after the incident, he was over the drink-drive limit of 80mg, having 95mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood.

Smashed: The front of the First double-decker after it was crashed by Steven Derrick who was later arrested and found to be over the drink-drive limit

The father-of-one, who worked as a driver since 2008, picked up the First bus from a depot at 6:20am after drinking 'four or five double Jack Daniel's' and a 'pint of lager' the previous night, Bristol Magistrates' court heard.

The number 90 bus contained eight passengers before the collision on September 30 last year.

One passenger David Summerhayes said that the driver appeared to be 'staring into space' when he boarded the bus and 'blanked' him.

Mr Summerhayes said the bus clipped the kerb three times, leading him to assume the driver was a trainee.

Derrick later stopped at a bus stop where nobody was waiting, remaining idle for 30 seconds, before doing the same thing further along the route.

Passengers were so concerned by his driving that they threatened to leave the bus before their stops.

Wreck: The bus crashed into a parked Mini Cooper, which was forced 20ft along the road before hitting another vehicle, which then crashed into a third car

While driving along St John's Lane, having 
already narrowly missed a parked car, Derrick swerved into the 
middle of the road to avoid parked cars.

He then swerved left, hitting the white Mini head-on, forcing it 20ft along the road and into 
another parked car, which then hit a third vehicle. Nobody was injured during the incident.

Mini owner Sarah Chuk said: 'If I had been in my car pulling away, I dread to think what might have happened.'

Derrick resigned after the incident but went on to get another driving job.

Passing sentence, magistrate
Roger Dunster said: 'There could have been pedestrians in the vicinity 
and the result could have been much more serious.'

He was disqualified from driving for a year, ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work and to pay costs of Â£85.

Reckless: Bristol Magistrates' court heard how Derrick had consumed 'four or five double Jack Daniel's' and a pint of lager the night before he picked up the bus from the depot at 6:20am

Lucky escape: The Mini Cooper's owner Sarah Chuk said: 'If I had been in my car pulling away, I dread to think what might have happened'

Judy Hampton, mitigating, said her client had personal problems at the time.

She said: 'Derrick is extremely remorseful and apologetic to the passengers on the bus that particular morning.

'He is, himself, shocked by what took place. As this was an early start, clearly the alcohol had not all gone from his system.'

First Bus spokeswoman Karen Baxter said the company has a 'stringent' drug and alcohol policy.

She said: 'We randomly test 10 per cent of our entire workforce on an unannounced basis for any breaches of this policy and in addition to this have a process whereby when there is reasonable suspicion that an employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, they can also be tested.'
