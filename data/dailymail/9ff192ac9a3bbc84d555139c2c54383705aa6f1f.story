Tracy Morton leaves Reading Employment Tribunal Centre where she is suing West London Mental Health Trust for unfair dismissal from her job as a counsellor at Broadmoor Top Security Psychiatric Hospital

A counsellor wrote to one of Britain's most dangerous men telling him how special he was before ordering him 'now eat this card', an employment tribunal has heard.

Tracy Morton would enter patients' rooms alone on a ward for the most high-risk and dangerous patients at top-security Broadmoor psychiatric hospital.

It was alleged that the trained martial artist, who worked as a clinical team leader, tolerated inappropriate conduct which culminated in a therapy assistant friend resigning amid accusations of a sexual relationship with two patients.

Morton was sacked after handing a 
junior colleague a packet of sweets, to give to a patient being held 
under section in the top security wing, along with the bizarre card - 
which asked him to dispose of it by eating it, the tribunal heard.

The
card told the unnamed man he was 'very special'. Morton was also said to have given patients food and sworn 
openly on the ward, the employment judge 
was told.

She is 
suing the hospital's management - West London Mental Health Trust - for 
unfair dismissal over the allegations of serious security breaches.

Michael Humphrey, Broadmoor's director of security, said: 'We reviewed the card that Ms Morton had given to a patient.

'The wording was akin to terms of endearment as if Ms Morton was trying to tell the patient that he was very special to her.

'This
was completely at odds with a professional relationship and Ms Morton's
remark "now eat this card" was sending a message to the patient that 
she knew that this action completely flouted trust policy and she was 
seeking the patient's collusion in this regard.

'The wording of the card indicated that Morton had a special relationship with the patient which was of a personal nature.

'From
other cases I've seen actions of this kind can lead to boundary 
violations of a more serious nature that can include criminal offences.'

The
security breach came just months after a friend and colleague who she 
had closely mentored resigned when a letter she had penned for another 
inmate was handed to staff.

The note revealed the therapy 
assistant, who has not been named, had an inappropriate relationship 
with the detained man, who accused her of having sex with him and 
another patient.

In the 
bombshell revelation he demanded an HIV test, fearing the sexual 
indiscretion could have led to him contracting the disease.

The relationship had been developing 
since Christmas 2009 under Ms Morton's nose while she was supposed to be
mentoring her, and the pair had repeated conversations about stopping 
contact between them.

However, the carer was only moved in the summer of 2010 when another post became available on a different ward.

At the time the patient broke his 
silence there were said to be two copies of the note, one was held by 
managers while the other was thought to have been eaten by the recipient
in order to dispose of it.

The
instruction to 'eat this card' contained in Morton's own note was said 
to be a sign that she knew her actions were wrong and wanted him to 
dispose of the evidence.

During disciplinary interviews she 
admitted what she did was wrong but explained it by saying she was upset
about the suspension of her manager, who had faced internal action over
failures relating to the sex scandal.

'The patients within the unit consist of
mostly young men who suffer from serious personality disorders who as a
result of their disorders have committed very serious crimes such as 
murder, rape or paedophilia.'

Morton justified venturing into bedrooms alone up to four times by saying she was a skilled martial artist and could handle herself, the tribunal, sitting in Reading, Berkshire, heard.

Among the barrage of allegations levelled at her was the claim she regularly swore back at inmates when they used four letter words towards her.

Angela Dolan, the hospital's service director for personality disorder patients, said: 'The language used by Ms Morton in the card was particularly concerning.

'Ms Morton had stated in the card that she treasured working with the particular patient.

'We considered that this language was highly emotive and completely inappropriate within the confines of a professional relationship in the high secure hospital.

'This in itself was a clear breach of professional boundaries between Ms Morton and the patient which, given Ms Morton's seniority, was very concerning.'

She added: 'Taking all of the allegations into consideration we considered that Ms Morton's actions had amounted to gross misconduct and that she should have been summarily dismissed from her post.'

The tribunal heard that while there were allegations of an unprofessional relationship there were no claims of a sexual relationship between them.

However, Ms Dolan described how the scheming and manipulative patients at the Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder Unit would groom staff.

She said: 'The DSPD Unit, which is located in the Paddock Centre, houses some of the most seriously disordered and dangerous patients within Broadmoor Hospital.

'This was one of two NHS units within the UK treating this category of patient.

'The DSPD Unit was set up in 2000 as part of a national pilot, as a result of the government's manifesto dealing with public protection issues.

'Patients within the unit are categorised as people who pose a high risk of causing physical or psychological harm to others.

'The patients within the unit consist of mostly young men who suffer from serious personality disorders who as a result of their disorders have committed very serious crimes such as murder, rape or paedophilia.'

She added: 'These individuals are highly manipulative and often seek out vulnerable members of staff and attempt to groom them for inappropriate relationships and obtain prohibited items to be brought into the hospital.

'The risk to safety presented by these patients is therefore often more likely psychological rather than physical.'

Morton, from Reading, Berkshire, was fired after a disciplinary hearing on May 26 last year.

The hearing continues.

Britain's Hannibal, Robert Maudsley, who killed four people, one of whom he ate. He was a patient at Broadmoor

Broadmoor was the first custom-built asylum to house criminal lunatics, constructed in 1863.

The idea was triggered by the case of James Hadfield, an ex-soldier who, in 1800, while watching a play at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, levelled his pistol at King George III and fired at him.

He missed, but his subsequent acquittal by reason of insanity caused such public uproar that Parliament speedily passed the Criminal Lunatics Act to provide for the indefinite detention of the insane, and a new institution was born, 'intended for the reception, safe custody and treatment of persons who had committed crimes while actually insane or who became insane while undergoing sentences of punishment'.

The possible causes of insanity were listed as 'anxiety, epilepsy, intemperance, vice, poverty, religious excitement, fright and exposure to hot climates'.

The 53-acre high-security psychiatric hospital, which now holds roughly 230 men, initially had room for 400 men and 100 women.

Among the first inmates were two would-be assassins of Queen Victoria, Edward Oxford and Roderick McLean.

Edward Oxford was 18 and serving beer in a pub when in 1840 he tried to shoot the Queen and Prince Albert as they rode out on Constitution Hill.

Ian Brady (pictured) and Myra Hindley murdered five children between 1963 and 1965

Both bullets missed, and they were later found to be blanks.

Roderick McLean was judged insane after he fired a revolver point-blank at the Queen - and missed - in 1882 as she left Windsor train station.

Other notable past inmates have included notorious child killer John Straffen, the UK's longest-serving prisoner, who died in jail, 55 years after being convicted of murdering a schoolgirl.

The Kray twins, Moors murderer Ian Brady and the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, have all been held at the hospital.

Perhaps the most notorious is one who few of Broadmoor's residents ever saw, the original Hannibal Lecter.

Robert Maudsley was in Broadmoor for three years in the Seventies after he killed four people, one of whom he ate.

He was nicknamed Spoons after Maudsley and another psychopath took a Broadmoor patient, a paedophile, and barricaded themselves into a cell with him.

The paedophile was tortured for nine hours before Maudsley garrotted him and held up his body so that the staff could see him through the spy hatch.

When the staff were let in, they found that the man's skull had been cracked open like a boiled egg, with part of the brain missing and spoon hanging out of the cranium.
