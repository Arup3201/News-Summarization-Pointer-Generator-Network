Within seconds, my eyelashes freeze. Shortly followed by the hairs inside my nose. It's minus 30C; a punishing cold - and tonight I'll be sleeping in a room made entirely of ice. I'm not allowed to take any personal belongings with me because they'll freeze.

The Ice hotel, in Jukkasjärvi in Swedish Lapland, 120 miles into the arctic circle, celebrates its 25th birthday this year. 

Its presence is cyclical: every March, huge blocks of ice are harvested from the town's lifeblood, the River Torne; stored in a freezing warehouse over summer and carved, mounted up and smoothed into 55 ethereal rooms, an ice bar and a chapel. Come April, the sun is strong, everything melts and the river rolls on again.

The spectacular Ice Hotel, in Jukkasjärvi in Swedish Lapland, 120 miles into the arctic circle, celebrates its 25th birthday this year

As I flounder into an arctic sleeping bag wearing the advised long johns, hat, gloves and woolen socks, I fear this will be a long night. I start to regret the generous helping of wine I had 'to warm me up' – no one needs an emergency midnight loo visit at -5C. I may be lying on several reindeer hides, but the ice bed, walls, floor, ceiling and sculptures aren't exactly lulling me to sleep.

It really is cold. Cold, but the peace is immediate, I can hear my own breath.

The hotel is open to guests from December to April, and sees as many as 50,000 visitors in a season. Main hall, pictured here

'Don't underestimate how cold it can be. Dressing correctly in the Arctic environment, where temperatures can easily dip below -30°C, enables visitors to enjoy the pristine wilderness without exposing themselves to very real danger,' says Simply Sweden's Chris Graham. 'We offer the following advice to all customers who book a winter holiday to this region and most of our holidays include a loan of high grade warm outer clothing for activities.'

'Layer up. The first should by thin, made from synthetic fabric or wool (not cotton) and designed to wick moisture away from the body. There are some excellent technical fabrics on the market. Next, a thick middle layer, or several thin layers (make sure they fit over each other, allowing free movement) – base layers, fleeces or wool jumpers work well. Bring thermal leggings, too. 

'Although we arrange for loans of clothing such as wool fleece bottoms and snowmobile suits, it's a good idea to bring a large down wind and waterproof jacket and protective trousers. If you get hot, you can always take a layer off.

'Watch the extremities. Wear thin liner gloves, then a pair of mittens, which keep hands warmer than finger gloves. Liner socks (silk are good), then one or two pairs of wool, not cotton, socks will keep feet warm and dry, as will a pair of specialist boots (try them on with all your socks). Again, guests are provided with appropriate boots, thick leather mittens and protective deerstalker hats for outdoor activities.

'Don't wash or shave just before going out into the cold – the natural oils in the skin protect against the extreme elements. And don't use water-based cosmetics or soaps because they will freeze.'

Extreme weather: Temperatures in Northern Sweden can drop down to as low as minus 40 degrees in the winter months

On checking in, guests are armed with an enormous padded boiler suit, snow boots, fleece and leather mittens and a balaclava. Over the four days of my stay, temperatures drop to -37C, so despite looking like a cross between Robocop and a yeti, these warm items become my allies.

It's not all freezing though. The hotel has two warm receptions and a warm restaurant dishing out reindeer meat and hot chocolate, as well as plenty of warm suites and chalets. Also, once you've been outside, the interior seems quite toasty. 'Snice' the combination of snow and ice used to build the hotel, is insulating, keeping the temperature at -5C.

Cold rooms come in tiers: from bread and butter ice bed and four walls to super deluxe suites complete with a warm section with a sauna and toilet built in. But the art suites are king. Each year, the hotel pumps around £900,000 into gathering ideas from graphic designers, wood sculptors, street artists, architects –even musicians (over 50 per cent have never worked with ice before). 

A jury decides the best 15 and the artist then travels to Lapland to construct their design. 'We're not looking for another swan or dolphin, we want original ideas,' says Jens, one of the hotel's top designers. 'We don't want the rooms to look like ice cream and slush.'

My room, Ways of Vision, designed by Swedish sculptors Lena Kristrom and Nina Hedman, entitled Rays of Vision. Inspired by the corbels of Uppsala Cathedral, statues on pillars surrounding the bed, symbolise the different ways of seeing which exist in our world.

Its three-night Traditional Icehotel break costs from £995 per person, including b&b accommodation (one night in a cold room, two nights in a warm room), flights, transfers and a guided tour of Icehotel. 

Activities cost extra, but often include lunch or dinner and start at £124 per person for a four-hour Northern Lights Snowmobile Excursion with evening meal. For more information on Swedish Lapland, visit www.swedishlapland.co.uk 

There's an art to dressing for cold weather, especially sleeping in it. The idea is to layer, but only using the correct fabrics, if you get too warm, you'll sweat, and when the moisture freezes, so will you. 

Several fellow visitors don't appear to have received the memo; I see one motley lot wondering around in onesies, a woman carrying an aeroplane travel pillow and one lunatic even wearing flip flops.

The cold weather clearly gets to people. 'Children often try and lick the ice,' says Paula, the guide. 'Last year a 24-year-old student try to kiss the ice and staff had to unstick him using hot water and chisels'. I'm told another member of staff walked in on a couple making the most of the double sleeping bag, too. But mostly, people just don't wear the right clothes and suffer as a consequence. 

I sleep surprisingly well. It takes a while to shift the 'I'm cold' voice in my head, and I manage to lose a crucial glove and my hat during the night, but I wake up feeling remarkably refreshed. 

I thought I'd feel shattered in the morning, but I feel cleansed; lighter; like I've spent the night inhaling the purest Swedish air. There's something quite magical about sleeping in ice.

At the Ice Bar, cocktails are served up 'in ice'; while the hotel is required by law to have fire extinguishers, despite threat of fire being unlikely

It seems ice hotel visitors are a fruity lot: Last year, one room featured a female bust made entirely of ice. Two prominent features were practically worn down to nothing by the end of the season.

The hotel offers all kinds of tours, from dog sledding to snowmobiling through the Narnia-like forests, where trees wear their heavy snow like thick fur coats. But wrap up warm.

A night snow mobile excursion leaves me with frostbite, and twenty minutes into my reindeer sledding experience, I am alone in a forest at minus 35. My slightly clapped out reindeer won't run for love nor money, which results in me letting out some embarrassing, desperate go faster noises. Meanwhile another member of the team falls off three times, and even the reindeers start to frost over. But the best is saved for my last night.

'The Lights, they're massive,' somebody cries in the Homestead restaurant, a listed wood clad building, offering Ice Hotel customers all manner of cockle-warming local dishes. 

I stumble outside as fast as is possible in my boiler suit, eight pairs of socks, two hats, and three balaclavas, and look up. The Aurora is alive.

The cold has stopped burning, and I lie in a mound of snow taking photographs. My camera growls and dies. The whole black starry night is lit up in green with streaks like a UFO jet stream and burning white strands circle above. Not everything survives the cold here, but if you can, it's well worth a night at the Ice Hotel.
