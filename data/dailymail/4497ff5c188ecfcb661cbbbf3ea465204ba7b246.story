Davies, who plans to travel to diverse marine biology areas throughout the next year, has just returned from Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia.

'I travelled to Ningaloo Reef and spent two weeks out on the water everyday, whale shark guiding, freediving and surfing.The diversity of marine life in this part of the word is phenomonal,' she said.Â 

She proudly boasted of swimming with a mother and calf humpback whale, whale sharks, tiger sharks, manta rays and dugongs.

'I was also lucky enough to view the reef from the whale shark spotter plane, and help spot humpbacks, whale sharks and manta rays from an aerial view.'
