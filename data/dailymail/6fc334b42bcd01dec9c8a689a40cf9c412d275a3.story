It is classed as easy-to-watch, family-friendly television for a Sunday evening. 

But this week viewers of BBC1 drama Call the Midwife were subjected to a
 graphic grotesque depiction of a back alley abortion before the 
watershed which left them shocked.

Complaints have been made to broadcasting watchdog OFCOM and directly to
 the BBC about the episode which was also yesterday criticised by 
professionals and campaigners.

Sunday drama: Fans of Call The Midwife were shocked to see the harrowing depiction of a backstreet abortion before the watershed

Many expressed concerns about children being exposed to the graphic 
scenes and said that it was not the right way to tackle such a serious 
issue.

Complaints began being made after the show finished at 9pm and 
discussion boards were soon full of comments about the ‘gross’ and 
‘disgusting’ content.

One asked: ‘Is it really appropriate to show a backstreet abortion before the watershed?’

Others said they had left the room during the scene or watched from behind their hands.

Sunday night’s episode attracted 8.3 million viewers just shy of a series high of 9.3 million on January 20.

Fans have come to expect the drama to produce emotional storylines and the occasional bit of uncomfortable viewing.

But many thought that this plot was a step too far.

On Mums Net, one user wrote: ‘Had to walk out of the room during illegal
 abortion scene’, while another added: ‘Very uncomfortable viewing.’

The scene takes place in the two-bedroom east London flat of pregnant Nora Harding.

She lives there in near-squalor with her out-of-work husband and eight 
young children because the council refuses to upgrade them to a bigger 
property.

Mrs Harding is dismayed at the prospect of adding to her already 
struggling family and so enlists the help of a neighbour to perform the 
abortion, selling her wedding ring to pay for it.

The neighbour, a herbalist named Mrs Pritchard, arrives with a rubber 
sheet, which she rolls out on the kitchen table, and cloth-bound set of 
rusty tools.

Mrs Harding climbs onto on the make-shift gurney and lies on her back 
with her knees bent, writhing in pain as Mrs Pritchard gets to work.

A Digital Spy forum member described the scene as ‘harrowing, from the 
rubber sheet going on the table to the way she screamed in pain’. 
Another wrote: ‘Couldn’t watch the botched illegal abortion scene, had 
me squirming.’

Throughout the procedure the camera repeatedly cuts to and from an 
unrelated scene in which one of the midwives, Trixie, is getting ready 
for a date.

True to life: The BBC defended the decision to show the scene saying it reflects the real life of nurses and women in the East End in the 50's (pictured)

Using sharp implements she files her nails and pushes back her cuticles,
 before painting blood-red varnish on top, which drips into pools on the
 floor. 

But the editing did little to hide the horrors of the unfolding abortion scene.

One viewer wrote on a BBC message board: ‘The flicking between the 
procedure and the filing/painting of nails actually made me wince more 
than if they’d just shown the lady screaming.

‘Very imaginative way of depicting the horror pre water shed.’

Earlier in the episode Mrs Harding had tried other unconventional methods to rid herself of the unwanted baby.

Call the Midwife is a BBC period drama based on the memoirs of late author Jennifer Worth.

It follows a group of young midwives working in London’s East End slums,
 and the work they do out of Nonnatus House, a nursing convent.

Now in its second series, the programme first aired in January 2012 and a third series is planned for early 2014.

Miranda Hart starred until the departure of her character, Chummy. The 
role won her a National Television Award for outstanding drama 
performance and she was also nominated for a BAFTA.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Call The Midwife is inspired by the reality of 
East End life in the 1950s and prior to the legalisation of abortion, 
back street terminations were a documented phenomenon.

'Call The Midwife
 has never shied away from the tough conditions and difficult decisions 
made by pregnant women throughout this era and the series has become a 
critical and popular success thanks to its frank and honest approach.’

They included drinking gin in a scolding hot bath, punching herself in the stomach and taking Epsom salts.

And before deciding to go through with the abortion she had sent her 
husband out for knitting needles and a crochet hook, with the intention 
of performing it herself.

Shots of Mrs Harding’s blood-soaked clothes and sickened face are 
followed by others of her in a hospital bed, having contracted 
septicaemia and collapsed into a coma.

The episode ends with her making a full recovery and moving to the country with her family to start a new life.

But viewers were left feeling upset and angry over what they had been exposed to.

Margaret Morrissey of Parents Outloud said: ‘Broadcasters need to take 
responsibility and realise that children will have watched this, 
especially since it is half term week for a lot of schools around the 
country so they will have been up later.

‘We all know that they [back alley abortions] happened and the problems 
that they caused but we don’t need to view it on television.

‘It’s not that I think we should hide things or pretend they didn’t 
happen but I just think that sometimes it is something that needs to be 
told in the context of a different situation to a television programme.

‘It’s something children will learn about, but during school education in an informed way, not on television in a graphic way.’

Natika Halil, Director of Information FPA (Family Planning Association) said:

‘Back-street abortion is shocking and upsetting but this was the grim 
reality for women in Britain before abortion became legal in 1967. FPA 
started running contraception clinics in the 1930s and what happened to 
women like ‘Nora’ in Call the Midwife is well documented.

'While it can 
be difficult to read or watch, the issue mustn’t be airbrushed. Some 
women died and many others suffered terrible health conditions as a 
result and this reminds us of a situation we must never go back to.’
