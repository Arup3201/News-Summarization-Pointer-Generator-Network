The walls are bare, the floors uncarpeted. There is a tin bath, and no central heating.

It hardly looks like the house of a wealthy woman, but this is the first glimpse of the meagre council property is where Joan Edwards, the woman who left more than £500,000 to the government in her will, lived.

The money was controversially accepted by both the Tories and Lib Dems, but handed over to the Treasury yesterday after a furious row emerged over their acceptance of the money.

Home sweet home: Joan Edwards pictured outside her Bristol council home in 1931 the former nurse left her fortune to the Government to spend 'as they may think fit.'

But despite her wealth Miss Edwards, 90, lived in the modest council home in Bristol where she was born and raised.

Friends say she still washed in a tin bath and lived mainly off vegetables she grew in a small plot in the garden.

Local people dubbed her ‘the last Victorian’ because she lived such a strict and pious life - wearing a plain outfit and a hat with a feather in.

She would scold noisy children playing outside her home - which she once had the chance to buy for £2,000 but declined the council’s offer.

Modest: The ordinary semi-detached property which Miss Edwards lived in all her life, under the right to buy the scheme she was offered the chance to buy it for just £2,000 but refused

Frugal: Inside the home where Joan Edwards lived all her life, sparsely furnished and with bare floorboards

Joan also would not allow Bristol City Council to put in new windows or kitchen preferring to keep things the way she had always known them.

The new occupants, Louise and Jason Jones, said the local authority had to revamp the property before they could move in last March.

Mrs Jones said: 'We have heard about her. She still had all the cladding in the bedroom and the wooden beams.

'The council said she refused to allow them to do the kitchen, put central heating in or touch the windows.'

Neighbour Patrick Dunleavy, 71, said walking into the former nurse’s home was like stepping back in time.

The last Victorian: Miss Edwards pictured shortly before her death and, right, as a child in 1931, was well known amongst her neighbours for strict and pious lifestyle

He said: 'I used to call her the last Victorian. She was very strict. There would be kids playing in the street and she would come out and tell them off.

'She would also dress in a very old fashioned way with laced up boots and a hat with a feather in it. She certainly wasn’t trendy.'

Mr Dunleavy, who lives opposite and had known Miss Edwards for 40 years, added: 'Walking into her house was like going back in time.

'She had no central heating, instead using an old gas stove and boiler. In her bathroom there was a big standalone cast iron bath.

'She had a small electric heater in her bedroom and a slightly bigger one in the lounge, where there was also a Welsh dresser. That was about it.

'It seemed like the house had hardly been touched since the day it was first built.

Simple taste: Miss Edwards refused to have central heating and double glazing installed in her home, preferring to use small electric heaters and a tin bath

'She must have used coal as well, because she asked me one day if I knew anybody who would want it.

'She had a vegetable patch in the garden that I would help with, although she didn’t use that as much as she got older.

'Considering how much money she had you, would have thought she could have lived more comfortably.'

Even though the council had revamped the house which she lived in since 1931, Miss Edwards' home still has some of the original fittings including wooden beams and floorboards.

Neighbours described her as a 'churchgoing and highly intelligent' lady who turned down the chance to buy her £160,000 house for just £2,000 under the right-to-buy scheme.

Miss Edwards estate has been at the centre of a political storm when instead of spending the money on the Health Service, schools or to ease the national debt, the Coalition shared the £519,999 between them as a party donation.

Stunned: Neighbours Sarah Brennan, 44, and Lucy Sanders, 44, were shocked to discover how much Miss Edwards was worth after witnessing the frugal way she lived.

With bare floors and a modest decor her home was a time capsule to years gone by and revealed nothing of the £500,000 stash of cash she left to the Government when she died

Into the time warp: Miss Edwards' neigbours said walking through her door was like stepping back in time

But after a backlash, leaders handed the cash over to the treasury meaning it will go back into the public purse rather than fund the parties.

Her friend, Joan Seville, 85, said she thought Miss Edwards had been a Conservative, and had made her money buying and selling shares.

When she wrote her will in 2001, Labour were in power, having just won their second term in a landslide victory.

Labour Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy criticised those who allowed the donation to be accepted in teh first place saying she believes they were 'blinded' by greed.

She said: 'It seems to me utterly inconceivable that a bequest to "the Government of the day" could be interpreted as a donation to the Tories and Lib Dems to spend on electioneering.

'I want to know what questions were asked when the money came in, and whether the parties were involved in any discussions with the executors beforehand as to how the money was to be split - a conversation that surely should have rung alarm bells.

'I can only assume that greed blinded them to the questions that should have been asked.

'Joan was obviously a very private person and would no doubt be horrified by all this attention, but now that her legacy is in the public domain, I think that rather than it just being swallowed up in the Treasury coffers, it would be a decent gesture to use at least part of her legacy to fund something close to her heart, such as the excellent new birth centre down the road at Cossham hospital, training for nurses at nearby UWE or replacing some of the 681 nurses that North Bristol trust has lost since 2010.'
