A Russian warship was intercepted by the Royal Navy as it strayed close to the UK while passing through the English Channel.

The vessel – equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes – was monitored and escorted by a heavily-armed British frigate. 

Yesterday, the Ministry of Defence stressed that the encounter was in accordance with international law. However, it comes at a time of heightened tension between Britain and Russia.

Last month, RAF jets were scrambled to intercept two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles as they flew south of Bournemouth. And in November, a four-strong squadron of the country’s Northern Fleet sailed through the Channel.

The manoeuvres have raised fears that the Russians are looking for weaknesses in the British naval force.

In the latest incident, Plymouth-based HMS Argyll, which has a crew of 185, intercepted the Neustrashimy-class warship and its accompanying tanker as they headed home after a deployment in the Mediterranean.

The 4,900-ton Type 23 frigate used its Lynx helicopter and hi-tech sensors to locate the vessels off the French coast and track them as they entered the Channel.

The MoD said the Royal Navy took over from French surveillance, in line with the Nato agreement, and described the operation as ‘pretty routine’.

But military sources insisted it was vital the Armed Forces were poised to react swiftly as Russia has stepped up its military drills in recent months with a greater number of naval exercises and reports of incursions by Russian fighter jets and bombers.

A naval source said: ‘They were not provocative but the British public would expect nothing less of the Navy than to be alert and keep an eye out for any potential threat, and to be ready to react in case it that turns into an actual threat.’

It is understood that the Russian vessels complied with all maritime reporting regulations - they did not encroach on British waters and abided by the correct regulations while passing through the Strait of Dover.

A MoD spokesman estimated that a Russian warship was escorted through the Channel every few months.

Russia has been suspected of military provocation as its economy continues to suffer under international sanctions. 

These have been imposed by the West over allegations that Moscow has been providing troops and equipment to separatist rebels in Ukraine. 

Many other European countries have reported what are widely seen as displays of Russian military prowess.  

Britain summoned the Russian ambassador for a dressing down after the long-range bombers flew over the Channel close to UK airspace last month, disrupting civil aviation and prompting Britain to scramble two Typhoon fast jets.

Experts said Vladimir Putin’s move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression.

More than 100 Russian aircraft were intercepted last year, three times more than during the whole of 2013. 

In November, HMS Tyne escorted a Russian flotilla led by the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov through the English Channel.
