Tottenham could be without Andros Townsend when they return to Premier League action for their clash with West Brom on Sunday.

The Spurs winger started in the club's 0-0 Europa League group stage opener at Partizan Belgrade but was replaced short of the hour mark by Erik Lamela after picking up an upper leg injury.

Mauricio Pochettino didn't know the full extent of the damage, claiming the England international would need to be assessed by the club's medical team on Friday.

'Andros has a problem with his leg,' siad Pochettino after the game. 'It could be his glute, and Friday we'll know if he's available or not.'

A defensive minded Tottenham failed to have a shot on target in the Belgrade stalemate, but the Spurs boss admitted he was happy with his side's performance - praising debutant Federico Fazio as well as Benji Stambouli who was making his first start.

'I think the result is fair because Partizan were good in the second half,' Pochettino added.

There was also a first start at the club for midfielder Benjamin Stambouli who was solid in Belgrade

 'It was Fazio's first game, like Stambouli, and they play for the first time. It's always difficult to make your debut but I'm happy with the performance.'

Spurs made 10 changes to the side which drew 2-2 at Sunderland last week, but Pochettino rebuffed any suggestions he underestimated the Serbian outfit.

'It was difficult to play and move the ball fast and quick, but that's no excuse,' Pochettino continued. 

'I never underestimated Partizan. We played with a team we thought would get three points. I believe that three points was most important but we'll analyse the game.

'Besiktas an Asteras drew their game too. We need to look forward to the next game.'
