Jerry Vale, the crooner known for his high-tenor voice and romantic songs in the 1950s and early 1960s, has died

Jerry Vale, the crooner known for his high-tenor voice and romantic songs in the 1950s and early 1960s, has died aged 83.

Vale, who had been in declining health, died on Sunday at his Palm Desert home surrounded by family and friends, family attorney Harold J. Levy said in a statement.

Born Genaro Louis Vitaliano, Vale started performing in New York supper clubs as a teenager, and also won a singing contest at a nightclub.

In the early 1950s, he signed a contract with Columbia Records and went on to record more than 50 albums.

Vale's first hit was You Can Never Give Me Back My Heart, released in 1953.

There followed a string of successes - with his renditions of Volare, Innamorata and Al Di La becoming classic Italian-American songs.

His biggest hit was You Don't Know Me, released in 1956.

Vale's recording of The Star-Spangled Banner in the 1960s was played at sporting events for years.

While his albums failed to make the charts in the early 1970s, Vale remained a popular club act.

He also appeared as himself in the movies Goodfellas, Casino and the TV series The Sopranos.

Vale
 was a friend of fellow Italian-American singer Frank Sinatra, and he 
was an honorary pallbearer at Sinatra's funeral on May 20, 1998.

He is said to have suffered a stroke in 2002, and had not performed recently.

Vale is survived by Rita, his wife of 55 years; a son, Robert; and a daughter, Pamela.
