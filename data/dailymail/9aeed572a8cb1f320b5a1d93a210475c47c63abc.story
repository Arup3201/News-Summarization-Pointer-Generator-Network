An Air Force colonel in charge of sex assault prevention has been charged with one of the very same crimes he's paid to stop after he allegedly groped a female victim while intoxicated.

Lt Col Jeff Krusinski, 41, the Air Force's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response boss, was arrested early on Sunday morning after police said he grabbed the female victim's breasts and buttocks in a parking lot in Crystal City, Virginia.

Police said that Krusinski, then tried to touch the woman again, but she was able to fight him off and call 911.

A booking photo taken after Krusinski's arrest showed numerous cuts and scratches on his face, but it's not known whether they were from the scuffle with the woman, who was not identified.

Krusinski was charged with sexual battery - a misdemeanor - and held on $5,000 bond.

An Air Force spokeswoman confirmed Krusinski's employment and rank to ARLnow.com, but would not comment further.

Police told the site that he and the 
victim did not know each other before encounter on South 23rd Street, a 
street dotted with several restaurants and bars.

NBC News reported that Krusinski was removed from his post as the Air Force conducts an investigation into his arrest.

Krusinski graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1994 with a degree in psychology.

He later attended St Maryâ€™s University and the Air Force Institute of Technology, according to his LinkedIn page.

Two years ago, while stationed in Afghanistan, he recorded a video greeting for the Air Force baseball team.

Pentagon press secretary George Little said in a tweet on Monday night that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is 'outraged and disgusted' over Krusinski's arrest.

It is another black eye for the Air Force, which is currently struggling with accusations of sexual assault within its ranks.

The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program says on its website that the program 'reinforces the Air Force's commitment to eliminate incidents of sexual assault through awareness and prevention training, education, victim advocacy, response, reporting and accountability.

'The Air Force promotes sensitive care and confidential reporting for victims of sexual assault and accountability for those who commit these crimes.'

Dozens of young female recruits and airmen at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio were victimized by their instructors who sexually harassed, improperly touched or raped them.

The preliminary figures for 2012 show there were nearly 800 reports of cases, ranging from inappropriate touching to rape, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen Mark Welsh said during his testimony to a House committee in January.

That would be a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011, when 614 cases were reported.

The 2012 figures were included in a report that the Defense Department submitted to Congress last month.

Hagel has been examining the startling epidemic.

According to defense officials, Hagel will seek legislation requiring that cases go through the U.S. Court of Military Appeals, and that senior officers no longer have the authority to set aside guilty findings.
