Beyonce wowed millions around the world with her spectacular Super Bowl performance on Sunday but there may be no halftime show next year - as New Jersey is too cold.

The 2014 Super Bowl will be the first to be played outdoors in cold weather conditions and the centerpiece 
performance may be a casualty of freezing temperatures, it was 
revealed today.

The New York Post
reported that there are no plans for a musical show at the Metlife Stadium in New Jersey as NFL officials can't work out how to put on the huge spectacle 
in wintry conditions.

Beyonce grabbed a share of the headlines alongside the 35-minute power outage and the Baltimore Ravens narrow victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.

On Monday speculation immediately began about who would play next year's event - local rockers Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi were early favorites.

Then NFL officials leaked that there are actually no plans for any sort of musical performance. 'It’s because of the cold weather,' one source told the Post.

'It’s not only the acts and the singers 
but [also] the crews that have to put the stage together. You know, the 
assembly has to be done a certain way,' the official said. 

'It’s choreographed and rehearsed so 
it can be assembled and disassembled as fast as possible. And you just 
can’t assemble the stage and break it down fast enough in the cold.'

'There’s no plan right now of what to do in its place,' the source continued.

The challenges of a cold-weather
Superbowl are not just musical - there is a long list of potential 
problems for the organizers.

The 2014 Super Bowl is the first to be staged in two states as New Jersey and New York are collaborating to host the massive event.

As a result, mass transit in the event of 
heavy snowfall is a major concern.

'The NFL is freaking out about these issues because they’ve never done a cold-weather Super Bowl,' one source told the Post.

'There are a thousand things we didn’t think about,' another source said.

But organizers admitting that they have no plans for a musical performance will come as a huge shock to the millions of fans who have enjoyed massive acts at the halftime show.

As Beyonce proved,
a spectacular halftime show is a vital part of the Super Bowl occasion 
and it is the most-watched 
musical event of the year.

Viewing figures have yet to be released for Beyonce's energetic turn, but Madonna's record breaking show in 2013 attracted 114 US viewers. Only 111 million people watched the actual game.

In the last 20 years the huge show 
has featured worldwide stars, who are not paid to perform but take 
advantage of the global audience.

Madonna's performance last year was 
well-received but surrounded by controversy after British rapper MIA 
flipped an obscene gesture at the camera.

In 2004 there was also a storm when 
Justin Timberlake revealed Janet Jackson's breast by removing a piece of
her clothing at the end of their performance.

Following that 'Nipplegate' storm, the chosen performers for the next few years were seen as 'safer' choices.

Paul McCartney played in 2005, Prince
wowed Miami in 2007, Bruce Springsteen performed in 2009 and the Who 
brought their rock anthems to Florida in 2010.

Other performers to have played the 
halftime show include the Rolling Stones, the Black-Eyed Peas, Tom Petty
and the Heartbreakers, and Britney Spears.
