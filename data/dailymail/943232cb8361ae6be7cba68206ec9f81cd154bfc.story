Two former Chicago police officers gleefully plotted how they were going to slice a man's penis in half in a gruesome extortion plot, authorities have claimed.

A court filing has been released ahead of the trial of Steven Mandell, 62, next month and includes a grisly transcript of him allegedly chatting with his co-conspirator, Gary Engel, in October 2012.

The recordings made by authorities at a Chicago residence show the men detailing how they were going to torture the unnamed victim so he'd hand over real estate, prosecutors say.

Both men were cops who lost their jobs in the 1980s after they were accused of a similar extortion plot. Days after their arrests in 2012, Engel was found hanged by a bed sheet in his prison cell.

Gruesome plot: Steven Mandell, left, who goes on trial next month, and Gary Engel, right, allegedly plotted to torture a businessman in October 2012. They allegedly planned to slice the victim's penis

In the recordings, they discussed how they'd tie up the victim and Mandell told Engel he knew he'd play with the man's penis by sticking 'a little blade there', according to filings shared by the Chicago Sun Times.

Engel said the man might come out 'with a split weeny'.

'It’s like slicing a banana split,' he told Mandell. 'You know what a banana split looks like?'

Mandell made 'Ooh' sounds and said he could 'feel it' as Engel detailed the torture.

'You don’t have to worry about pissing,' Engel said. 'To aim. Because it’s just going to go [sound effect]. Take that urethra right down the middle.'

Mandell then told Engel to be aware of the man's heart in case he died too quickly.

HQ: The men allegedly planned to bring him to this building, where they had set up a torture chamber

A court filing has been released ahead of Mandell's trial next month. It includes a gruesome transcript in which he and his co-conspirator Gary Engel allegedly detail how they will mutilate the victim's genitals.

Warning: Graphic content.

MANDELL: I know you are going to play with his f***ing dong. Right? Huh? You going to put a little blade there?

ENGEL: You never know. He might come out -

MANDELL: What are you going to tell him?

ENGEL: - with a split weeny.

MANDELL: Are you going to do the good guy, bad guy?

ENGEL: (Inaudible) putting that blade right up against the center, and just start -

MANDELL: I can feel it.

ENGEL: And you just start slicing down the middle. It’s like slicing a banana split. You know what a banana split looks like?

MANDELL: Ohhh.

ENGEL: You don’t have to worry about pissing.

MANDELL: Ohhh.

ENGEL: To aim. Because it’s just going to go (sound effect). Take that urethra right down the middle. (Sound effect).

The duo intended to pose as police 
officers and, using a fake arrest document, kidnap the man and take him 
to a custom-built murder chamber to torture him, according to 
conversations secretly recorded by a witness co-operating with police.

They
 planned to take the man to an office with a giant sink to drain his 
blood and torture him until he gave them money and millions of dollars 
worth of real estate, according to the criminal complaint.

'My 
guy knows what he's doing, he knows how to waterboard, do interrogation,
 psy-ops,' Mandell allegedly said of Engel.

On 
recordings, Mandell allegedly guessed the victim made as much as 
$100,000 a month in cash from 25 rental properties. The men also 
discussed demanding at least $500,000 from the man.

They then 
allegedly intended to dismember him with saws and a butcher's knife and 
Engel allegedly said he wanted the victim's dead body to 'bleed out... 
you want to let him drain'.

But before they could carry out the 
grisly murder, they were caught by the FBI in an undercover operation 
and arrested at the makeshift torture chamber in the northwest side of 
Chicago.

Officers said the men both had fake firearms and bogus 
law enforcement credentials. Mandell also possessed a fake arrest 
document naming the victim as a criminal defendant.

The FBI also 
found saws, a butcher knife, numerous zip-ties for restraints and a 
loaded .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol at the site.

Both men 
had previously been convicted - and cleared - of a similarly gruesome 
plot in Missouri in 1984; they allegedly intended to kidnap a Kansas 
City nightclub owner and extort money from him.

Engel was 
sentenced to 90 years in prison in 1991, while Mandell was sentenced to 
death in a separate murder case - making him the first police officer 
ever to go on death row.

Disgraced: Mandell, left, and Engel, right, were kicked out of the police in the 80s when they were arrested for a similar plot. Mandell spent time on death row before they were acquitted. Engel killed himself in 2012

But both men were eventually cleared and
 released after arguing that evidence had been improperly withheld at the trial. Engel was freed in 2010.

In this recent case, both men were charged with attempted extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion.

Mandell was a Chicago police officer for 10 years until 1983 while Engel worked in Willow Springs.

Engel was found hanged in his cell by a bed sheet the day before he was due to be arraigned in federal court in Chicago.
