They may already be larger than life, but these NFL players are
larger than their jerseys, thanks to new alterations in the uniform that were set
in place this season.

Several 300-pound-plus players have come forward to complain
about their new jerseys, saying they hug in all the wrong places and rise up to
the point where they look like belly shirts.

San Francisco 49ers player Alex Boone is one such player who
says he's mortified by the exposed midriff during games.

Defensive whine: The tight-fitting shirts may be a little too tight for Baltimore Ravens (left to right) Terrence Cody (62), nose tackle Maake Kemoeatu (96) and Haloti Ngata (92)

The 300-pound guard told the Wall Street Journal: 'It
makes me look fat, and I'm not fat.'

Boone told the paper that even his wife was no help.

'She said, "It looks like you ate a small baby."'

Baltimore Ravens defensive lineman Terrence Cody, who tips
the scales at 349 pounds, told the WSJ that he doesn’t particularly like the
new attire either.

He does, however, offer a solution: 'I feel like they
should put different material in for the big guys.'

No expense spared: The NFL and Nike showed off the new look in grand style with a gridiron-styled fashion show at a Brooklyn film studio in April

Representatives: Those players were mostly quarterbacks, receivers and running backs, who are typically the lighter guys on the field

The league unveiled the new Nike-designed uniforms in April,
dispatching a player from each of the 32 teams to parade around a Brooklyn, New
York, film studio in something of a gridiron fashion show.

Those players were mostly quarterbacks, receivers and
running backs, who are typically the lighter guys on the field.

The new uniforms came after the NFL’s licensing agreement
with Reebok expired in March - and the league turned to Nike for something
fresh and more sleek.

Dubbed the Nike Elite 51, the company's designers spoke to
numerous players, including Rams running back Steven Jackson, Jets cornerback
Darrelle Revis and Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, to find out what they
want in a uniform.

Back in April, Nike’s creative director for football and
baseball, Todd Van Horne, told Reuters: 'We wanted to understand performance
needs of the players.'

Amenities: While most of the 32 teams' designs remained the same, they were said to be much more breathable

Van Horne added: ‘They were told players want what they wear
to be as lightweight as possible. They want a lockdown fit but with full range
of motion.'

Even the belt buckle on the pants has been changed from
metal to aluminum. Overall, the uniform is said to be eight per cent lighter
than before.

The new uniforms also don't have zippers or laces at the top of the pants.

Nike also worked on what the players wear under their
uniform and developed different apparel for extremely hot or cold temperatures.

But Nike says that the players who feel their jerseys are
too tight should simply get a larger one.

A Nike spokesman told the WSJ: 'We have 40 years of
experience in the football business and the idea in our products is for optimal
performance and we work with the athletes to find fit and function.

'The uniforms are available in a variety of sizes and
cuts for different players with enhanced performance in mind.'
