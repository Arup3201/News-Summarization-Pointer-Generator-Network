A touching video has captured the moment the entire Ohio State football team lined up to hug a sports anchor after he returned to work following the death of his daughter.

Dom Tiberi, the sports director at the CBS affiliate WBNS-10TV in Columbus, lost his 21-year-old daughter Maria in a car crash on September 17 and returned to work little over a week later.

In a touching show of support after Ohio beat Wisconsin this weekend, every single member of the Ohio team stopped to embrace Tiberi and welcome him back, the video shows.

Tiberi seemed completely overwhelmed by their kindness and took a moment to regain control of his emotions after the final player left.

It came after his emotional return to the anchor desk on Thursday. He thanked viewers for their support and spoke of his love for his wife and his family.

'It's never going to be the same. A 
little piece of me died,' he said as he welled up with emotion. 'We're going to 
try to make a positive out of this and thanks for sticking with me.'

His daughter Maria, herself an Ohio State student, died after her Toyota Corolla struck a tractor-trailer on I-210 in Hilliard around 10.45pm on September 17.

She was rushed to Ohio Health Grant Medical Center but later died.

Police said the truck had apparently stopped in heavy traffic and the 30-year-old female driver was not injured in the crash.

He added that counseling services were being provided to students.

The principal of Dublin Coffman High School, where she attended, called her a 'wonderful young lady'.

'I will never forget and can still picture her amazing smile that she so effortlessly blessed us with each day,' Mike Ulring said. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Tiberi family as they remain great friends of Coffman High School and the Dublin Community.'
