Ministers today revealed they had refused to sack the head of the Student Loans Company - despite revelations thousands of graduates had been sent Wonga style letters from fake law firms demanding money.

Student Loans Company chairman Christian Brodie apologised to ministers and offered to resign over the 'misleading' letters sent out by the agency in an attempt to recover debts.

The 'clear and unequivocal' apology came in a meeting with Business Secretary Vince Cable last week, but Mr Brodie's resignation was not accepted.

Wonga was forced to hand out around £2.6million to customers in compensation for sending fake debt collection letters

The Government agency sent out letters under the name of Smith Lawson and Company Recovery Services - a firm it set up - demanding repayment for graduates that were in arrears.

But in a Commons statement today, the universities minister David Willetts said ministers believed Mr Brodie had a 'very important' job to do at the Student Loans Company - and claimed it would be unfair for him to take the blame for a practice that was nearly 10 years old.

More than 300,000 graduates received letters from Smith Lawson and Company over a 10-year period, it has emerged.

The system was stopped on June 27, following the Financial Conduct Authority's public condemnation of payday lender Wonga for similar 'aggressive and misleading practices'.

Like the Student Loans Company, Wonga sent letters to thousands of its customers from non-existent law firms threatening them with legal action.

The firm - which is the UK’s biggest lender - agreed to pay £2.6million in compensation to customers for making up the law firms to pressure debtors into paying up.

It sent bogus letters from made up law firms ‘Chainey, D’Amato & Shannon’ and Lowe Legal Recoveries’ to mislead customers into believing their outstanding debt had been passed to lawyers.

Despite condemnation from MPs over Wonga's behaviour at the time, Government minister Mr Willetts today backed the Student Loans Company.

In a Commons statement he said: 'Christian Brodie, the chairman of the SLC made a clear and unequivocal apology on behalf of the company in a discussion with the Secretary of State on Thursday July 3. I also spoke to Mr Brodie on Thursday to investigate what had happened.

'Mr Brodie tendered his resignation as chairman to the Secretary of State but this was not accepted. The Secretary of State and I have confidence in his leadership of the Student Loans Company.

'We see Mr Brodie having a very important job to do at the SLC to oversee the significant investment the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) is making in the company to enable it to transform its products and operations and overall levels of customer service.

'We are both clear that it would be unfair for Mr Brodie to take the blame for a practice that was nearly 10 years old, particularly as he had only been chairman since he joined in February of this year.'

The Student Loans Company has been issuing letters to graduates who fall into arrears on their repayments under the name of Smith Lawson and Company since 2005, Mr Willetts said.

In total, about 309,000 people received letters, which were sent to individuals who had failed to respond to several contact attempts by the SLC.

The practice, which was seen as a 'low-cost alternative' to referring these graduates to debt collection agencies, was approved in late 2004 by the SLC's board at the time and ministers under the Labour government, Mr Willetts said.

He insisted that the approach was not known to him or Mr Cable before recent media coverage of the issue.

While the Student Loans Company had not broken any rules or charged graduates for receiving the letters, Mr Willetts said, he added that 'it was clear that a public body should be holding itself to the highest standards in the treatment of its customers'.

He said: 'It is important that the Government recover taxpayers' money, but it must do so in a way which is fair.

'It must not use misleading tactics to get people to do the right thing. The SLC has apologised and now stopped issuing letters under the Smith Lawson trading name. I will be working with the company to ensure that lessons are learnt to ensure there is no repeat in future.'
