The President and First Lady wished the troops a merry Christmas with a visit to a U.S. Marine base on Tuesday.

His appearance with servicemen at a Christmas ceremony was his last public stop in Hawaii before he cuts short his vacation and flies back to Washington to return to negotiations over the fiscal cliff.

Barack Obama is expected to arrive in Washington early Thursday, the White House said Tuesday night. Michelle Obama and the couple's two daughters will remain in Hawaii.

In the past, the president's end-of-the-year holiday in his native state had stretched into the new year. The first family had left Washington last Friday night.

Congress has been expected to return to Washington late Thursday. Before he departed for Hawaii, Obama told reporters he expected to be back in the capital the following week.

Automatic budget cuts and tax increases are set to begin on January 1, which many economists say could send the country back into recession. So far, the president and congressional Republicans have been unable to reach agreement on any alternatives.

Lawmakers have expressed little but pessimism for the prospect of an agreement coming before the New Year. On Sunday, Sen Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, said she expects any action in the waning days of the year to be 'a patch because in four days we can't solve everything.'

The Obamas were spending the holiday at a rented home near Honolulu. On Christmas Day, the president and first lady visited with Marines to express thanks for their service.

'One of my favorite things is always coming to base on Christmas Day just to meet you and say thank you,' the president said at Marine Corps Base Hawaii's Anderson Hall. He said that being commander in chief was his greatest honor as president.

Obama took photos with individual service members and their families.

On Christmas Eve, Obama called members of the military to thank them for serving the nation, then joined his family for dinner, the White House said. The Obamas opened gifts Christmas morning, ate breakfast and sang carols.

Friends were joining the Obamas for Christmas dinner Tuesday night, the White House said.

President Obama and his wife Michelle celebrated Christmas from their tropical Hawaii getaway as they released a more festive looking picture of themselves onto their Twitter feed.

Despite leaving for Mr. Obama's home state of on Friday, the pair released the seasonal picture to the White House twitter feed today and spoke together during the weekly presidential address of how much they enjoy a White House Christmas.

Both the president and his wife spoke of the joy at spending the Holidays with loved ones and paid a special tribute to the men and women of the armed forces - serving abroad with their families in Afghanistan and in other deployments across the globe.

'So this week let’s give thanks for our veterans and their families,' the president said in this week's weekly address with his wife at his side. 'And let’s say a prayer for all our troops -- especially those in Afghanistan -- who are spending this holiday overseas, risking their lives to defend the freedoms we hold dear.

Michelle Obama also urged Americans to think of military families.

'Across this country, military spouses have been raising their families all alone during those long deployments,' she said. 'And let’s not forget about our military kids, moving from base to base -- and school to school -- every few years, and stepping up to help out at home when mom or dad is away.'

President Obama also spoke of the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast of America and the massacre of 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut.

'And this year, I know many of you are extending that kindness to the families who are still picking up the pieces from Hurricane Sandy and your prayers to the people of Newtown, Connecticut.,' he said.

Arriving in Hawaii after a busy Friday in Washington, the president have been playing golf with his friends, traveling to the gym at the Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe and of course relaxing on the beach.

He will probably be taking stock ahead of his second term inauguration in January after which he will have to confront some of the big issues that will cement or transform his legacy.

Some of the big issues awaiting the president's decisions are familiar, long-simmering problems. They include immigration and the need for a tenable balance between taxes, spending and borrowing.

Another issue, gun control, jumped to the national agenda's top tier this month following the massacre of first-graders and teachers in a Connecticut school. And the issue of climate change remains unresolved.

Veteran politicians and presidential historians say it's almost impossible for Obama to "go big" on all these issues. Indeed, it might prove difficult to go big on even one. While some counsel caution, others urge the president to be as bold and ambitious as possible.

That wasn't the case when she recently read Twas The Night Before Christmas at a Washington area children's hospital.

As she sat down on stage to begin reading the classic tale to the tiny tots, Bo the First Dog jumped right up on his mother's lap.

Unexpected: Though she knew Bo was at the vent, the First Lady clearly didn't expect the dog to get up on her lap

Making sure he can see: Michelle Obama held the book out in front of Bo so that he could 'read' along with her and the children during the recent Christmas event

He seemed quite comfy as well, since he didn't move from the position throughout the seven minute session.

Bo is significantly larger than the former First Dog, Barney, who was a small Scottish terrier, and Portuguese Water Dogs can weigh up to 55 pounds.

That was no matter for Michelle, however, as she gamefully played along and even jokingly held the book out so that the 4-year-old pup could 'read' along.

Though the First Lady visited the Children's National Medical Center on December 14, the video was not released until Christmas Eve, in keeping with the theme of the story.

Bo is a part of many of the White House traditions during the holidays, as he served as a sort of 'Waldo' figure throughout the decorations, with mini figurines in his likeness scattered throughout the many displays and 54 live trees.

Mrs Obama explained the reason why they used Bo repeatedly is because it was an easy theme for young visitors to catch on to during their tours and they can be given the task of spotting Bo in each of the rooms.

He also kept up the tradition- started by President Bush's pet Barney- of doing a video tour of the decorations throughout the White House that is then posted online for people to view in case they are not among the lucky thousands who tour it in person.

This is definitely not the first year that the holiday spotlight turned to Bo, as he has been the sole subject of each of the first family's Christmas cards since Barack took office in 2009.
