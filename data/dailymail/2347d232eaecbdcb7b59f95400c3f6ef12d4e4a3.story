Cardiff City have agreed to sell midfielder Mats Moller Daehli to Bundesliga side Freiburg for £2million in January.

The 19-year-old was signed by the Bluebirds just 12 months ago from Norwegian outfit Molde by former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as the club tried to avoid Premier League relegation.

The Norway international has only made two substitute appearances since Russell Slade replaced Solskjaer in the Cardiff hotseat, and will officially complete his move to Germany on January 3.

'Cardiff City Football Club can confirm that an agreement has been reached with SC Freiburg for the transfer of Mats Moller Daehli, subject to international clearance,' the Welsh outfit said in a club statement released on their website.

'The deal will be completed on January 3rd 2015 in conjunction with the start of the transfer window.

'We would like to place on record our thanks to Mats for his contribution and wish him the very best for his future.'

Daehli didn't make the match-day squad for Saturday's 3-2 home loss against Brentford - a result that sees the club move down to 11th in the Championship.

In his 12 months at the club, the teenager has scored once in 24 appearances.
