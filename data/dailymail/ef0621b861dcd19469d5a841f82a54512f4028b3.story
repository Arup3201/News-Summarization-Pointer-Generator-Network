A woman has discovered a new-found talent as an artist after hitting her head falling down the stairs - despite having no artistic flair before.

Pip Taylor, 49, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, always enjoyed art at school, but was advised against it as a profession because teachers said she didn’t have the ability.

But after suffering a serious concussion from falling down a flight of stairs, she has now suddenly gained the ability to draw beautiful works of art.

She now draws up to four pictures a day and, after seeing her work, strangers have even commissioned her to produce pieces for them.

Miss Taylor said: 'It is just extraordinary and quite strange really. I have always loved drawing and had hopes of becoming an artist as a teenager but I was never any good.

'I used to draw cartoons and the only thing I could really manage was Snoopy.

'I studied art at school and wanted to take it as an O Level, but my teacher advised me not to as I really wasn’t very good.

'I dug out my old notepad from when I was 16 and cringed at my attempts of drawing people and faces. They were just terrible.'

Miss Taylor can now copy almost any image and specialises in portaits, such as this one of actor Idris Elba

Miss Taylor suffered serious bruising to her brain after she tripped and fell down a flight of steps as she visited the racecourse in Chester with a friend in May 2012.

She said: 'I fell at the top of a flight of stone steps and hit the right-hand side of my head.

'I was rushed to hospital by ambulance and came to a couple of hours later, unsure of where I was.'

Miss Taylor is now compelled to draw every day and worries if she doesn’t draw she will lose her new talent over night- as quickly as she discovered it.

She added: 'I have always loved being artistic- even though it didn’t come naturally to me.

'When I was recovering and resting at home I decided to pick up a pencil and start sketching.

'I started doodling but something felt different. It was more natural and I was amazed at the images I could draw.

'It is a talent I developed over night. My sister jokes that she wants a bang on the head so she can wake up with a talent.'

Miss Taylor was left with bad bruising and suffered concussion and she was told it would take her six months to recover.

Since her fall, Miss Taylor has developed a skill for animal portraits, and can produced detailed sketches of dogs and pets

Her biggest fear is that she will suddenly lose her new talent as quickly as she discovered it

She said: 'I found myself sat at home recovering and I was bored. I hadn’t drawn for years but I bought a 2b pencil and a sketch pad and tried drawing.

'It felt really natural in a way it hadn’t before and I saw things in a different light. I began to realise I had a real skill in being able to copy things accurately.'

Miss Taylor’s brain doesn’t allow her to create her own images in her imagination, but she can copy objects, people and photographs perfectly.

She said: 'Although I’d been told there was no lasting damage, to me something had changed.

'In my mind, I’m simply copying the images and my drawings are identical to the originals.

Miss Taylor is one a handful of people around the world who have suffered a brain injury or head trauma and later woke up with amazing musical, artistic or mathematical abilities, known as Acquired Savant Syndrome.

While research into the cause is ongoing, there is no single theory explaining all savants.

Many researchers believe the underlying cause occurs when one side of the brain compensates for an injury to the other.

US psychiatrist Darold Treffert thinks certain injuries cause the brain to 'rewire' itself, unlocking new abilities.

In a study into the condition, he said: 'What happens is that there is injury, then there is the recruitment of other still-intact tissue.

'There is rewiring [of brain signals] through that intact tissue, and then there is the release of dormant potential within that brain area.'

Other cases include Lachlan Connors (pictured), a teenager from Denver, Colorado in the US, who became a musical genius after hitting his head playing lacrosse.

Despite being tone deaf before the accident and being unable to read music, he later taught himself how to play 13 different instruments.

Another American youngster, 10-year-old Orlando Serrell found he could perfectly remember each day's weather after being hit on the head with a baseball.

And Derek Amato, also from the US, became a master pianist at the age of 40 after injuring himself diving into the shallow end of a swimming pool.

Despite Miss Taylor's fears she'll lose her new talent, doctors say it is extremely rare for a savant to lose their skills after they have acquired them.

Miss Taylor mainly draws animals and pet portraits and her favourite part to draw are the eyes.

She
 added: 'I get such a pleasure from my art. My brain injury changed my 
life and I am just so glad that I have this positive talent from it.

'I don’t want to over-analyse how this has happened and I am terrified of losing my skill and I am living my dream.

'I draw as much as I can and I am truly grateful for this side effect of my brain injury.'

Luke Griggs, spokesman for brain injury association Headway, said: 'Our brains are capable of incredible things and while today we know so much more than we used to, there is still much to learn about the brain.

'The effects of brain injury can be devastating, but we know that with the right help, at the right time, there can be life after brain injury.

'At Headway, we encourage people to try arts and crafts, gardening, music and other activities that they may not have tried before their brain injuries.

'Activities like these can have multiple benefits including increasing confidence and improving hand-to-eye co-ordination.

'While different parts of our brain are responsible for different things, all parts of the brain are interconnected.

'Inhibition in one part of the brain following injury can lead to increased activity in other parts of the brain, which can sometimes result in surprising and unexpected effects.

'It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons behind Pip's fabulous new-found artistic ability but we are delighted she is enjoying her new hobby.'
