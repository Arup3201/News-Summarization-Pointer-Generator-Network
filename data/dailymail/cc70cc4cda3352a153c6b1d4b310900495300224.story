The Eurozone was back on the brink last night as Spain edged towards a financial disaster that could tear the single currency apart.

Analysts said Spain’s huge economy was at a ‘tipping point’ and would inevitably need international aid.

In a sign that Europe’s debt crisis is deepening, Italy’s borrowing costs edged higher, Greece was was facing a 1930s-style depression and its austerity measures were said to be faltering.

Additionally, ratings agencies 
threatened to strip Germany of its gold-plated credit rating because of 
the risk of the crisis spreading.

Treasury officials refused to discuss whether British taxpayers could be dragged into a bailout of Spain.

While the Coalition has extracted the 
UK from the Eurozone’s bailout funds, a full-blown crisis will probably 
mean Spain will also need a loan from the International Monetary Fund, 
of which Britain is a leading member.

David Cameron is pushing Eurozone 
leaders to agree that Germany and other wealthy countries in it, such as
 the Netherlands, should stand behind the debts of other countries.

Spain has already required an 
emergency loan package of up to £80billion to bail out its banks but 
that has done nothing to quell concerns about its ability to pay its 
way.

The country is crippled by a property crash and recession and the 
highest rate of unemployment in Europe.

Spain’s crucial ten-year bond yield – 
the interest rate the government pays to borrow and a key indicator of a
 country’s financial health – hit a new euro-era high of 7.6 per 
cent.

That is deep in the danger zone and well above the 7 per cent level
 that triggered bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

Spain is now 
paying more to service its debt over six months than countries such as 
Slovakia and the Czech Republic pay to borrow over ten years.

Sources close to the government were 
reported as saying that Spain would need a loan to avoid ‘imminent 
financial collapse’ facing the country when it has to cover a further 
£22billion of debt in October.

The Eurozone was further shaken by 
ratings agency Moody’s threat to downgrade the AAA credit ratings of 
Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Factory output in Germany and France fell at the fastest rate for more than three years.

The euro tumbled against the pound and shares from Madrid to Milan went into reverse.

Borrowing costs in Italy also soared as the financial markets bet that it will be the next domino to fall.

City analyst Gary Jenkins said. ‘The market is just saying Spain is a done deal, they are going to need a proper full bailout.

‘The danger is if Spain requires a bailout, the market will say Italy is next. And if that happens you have a major problem.’

Europe can ill-afford to rescue Spain –
 the fourth largest economy in the single currency bloc – and Italy is 
widely seen as too big to save.

In Greece, inspectors from the 
European Commission and the IMF returned to examine the country’s 
finances amid fears that austerity measures being demanded are simply 
not achievable.

‘Greece is hugely off track,’ one of the officials said.

The Greek prime minister said yesterday that the outlook for the country’s economy is even worse than feared.

Antonis Samaras said output could 
shrink by more than  7 per cent this year – a far steeper decline than 
the 5 per cent fall forecast.

The slump will bring the cumulative 
economic contraction to a punishing 20 per cent over the past five years
 in an echo of the Great Depression of the 1930s.

The premier insisted the country will 
return to growth ‘at the beginning of 2014’ and said he would seek a 
deal ‘as soon as possible’ to water down the cutbacks and reforms 
demanded in return for bailout funds.
