Woody Allen has yet to respond to resurfaced allegations he molested his adopted daughter Dylan when she was 7-years-old, but he has spoken out on the issue before.

In 1992 Allen gave a rare interview with 60 minutes, describing the allegations as calculated revenge by former-partner Mia Farrow for falling in love with her then 21-year-old daughter Soon-Yi Previn.

While the two were in the midst of a bitter custody battle, Allen says Farrow threatened his life on several occasions, and even sent him a voodoo Valentine.

Scary: Allen shared a picture of a voodoo Valentine Farrow sent him after their breakup, with pins stuck through all her children and a steak knife stabbing her image

She did it: Allen said he believed Farrow coached Dylan into implicating him for molestation (Dylan pictured with blonde curls, at bottom)

Just weeks before the molestation claims, the two got into a fight over the phone and Allen recalls Farrow saying: 'I have something very nasty planned for you'.

On another occasion, Farrow said: 'You took my daughter, and I'm gonna take yours.'

In addition to the verbal threats, Farrow hand-delivered a Valentine to Allen. When he opened it up is showed a family picture with Farrow and her children with needles sticking through each of the children, and a steak knife through Farrow.

Then in August 1992, after visiting his children at Farrow's country home in Connecticut, his ex accused him of taking Dylan into a room and molesting her. 

Allen and Farrow were partners for nearly 12 
years before breaking up when he fell in love with her 21-year-old 
adopted daughter Soon-Yi. From left to right, Dylan, Allen, Farrow and

In his 60 Minutes interview, Allen claimed that there was no basis for the allegations - not even an innocent incident that exaggerated.

'There is no possibility that anything remotely ever happened to Dylan,' he said.

Allen said he believed Farrow coached Dylan to implicate him. Allen's then-girlfriend and current wife Soon-Yi believed Farrow did it out of spite.

'Soon-Yi believes that [Mia] does not believe it. Soon-Yi thinks it's absolutely in character that she has made it up quite calculatingly.'

Warning: When Allen attended Dylan's birthday party, he says Farrow put up this handwritten sign on the door

Allen was never formally charged with sexual assault, though Connecticut state's attorney Frank S Maco said he found 'probable cause' to prosecute Allen. However, Maco decided not to peruse the case because he felt Dylan was too 'fragile' to go through the trial process and Farrow agreed.

The allegations resurfaced last month when Allen was awarded the Cecil B DeMille lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes.

During the ceremony, estranged son Ronan Farrow tweeted: 'Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?'

That started a media firestorm that eventually resulted in Dylan writing about the abuse for the first time this weekend in a New York Times open letter.

She described the incident, saying Allen led her to the home's attic and told her to lay on her stomach and play with her brother's toy train set.

'Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we'd go to Paris and I'd be a star in his movies.'

Critic: Dylan's adopted brother Moses Farrow spoke to People this week, saying he doesn't believe the molestation ever happened

Some have criticized Dylan for attacking her father again, saying it may have been a calculated move to damage his award-season chances for film Blue Jasmine.

Her own adopted brother Moses Farrow is one of those critics, telling People magazine he doesn't believe the molestation ever happened and that his mother turned the whole family against Allen after their split.

'My mother drummed it into me to hate my father for tearing apart the family and sexually molesting my sister,' he said.

Shortly after hearing her brother's statement, People reached out to Dylan to get a response, and she was clearly emotional.

'I'm sorry,' she apologized. 'I'm shaking right now.'

'My brother is dead to me,' she said.

Yesterday, the New York Times announced that Allen had reached out to them asking for the opportunity to respond to Dylan's letter.

The Times agreed, and the response could be published within days.
