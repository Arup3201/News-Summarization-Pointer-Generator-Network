Pressure: ‘Red’ Len McCluskey, told Labour leader Ed Miliband to ‘bring home the bacon’ for union members on Monday

The union bankrolling Labour’s general election campaign wants a new Ministry of Labour to represent the interests of trade unionists if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street.

Unite is in talks with the party about creating a powerful department headed by a secretary of state, whose role would be ‘batting for 30million working people’, a senior union figure has revealed.

In secret recordings passed to the Daily Mail, Steve Turner said Unite would also press for the repeal of trade union laws including the rule that unions can only call strikes after holding a postal ballot.

His remarks will heap further pressure on the Labour leader to distance himself from Unite.

On Monday, its general secretary, ‘Red’ Len McCluskey, told Mr Miliband to ‘bring home the bacon’ for union members as Unite pledged to donate up to £12million to Labour’s election campaign on top of the £12million given to the party since 2010.

But in return the union is drawing up a list of demands for an incoming Labour government – including higher taxes, spending increases, an end to ‘austerity’ and a ditching of all anti-union laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s. 

Mr Turner, Unite’s assistant general secretary, revealed that the union was also in talks with Labour about new powers for trade union representatives within private companies. 

Speaking at a fringe event at Unite’s policy conference in Liverpool, he said: ‘[There are] a whole host of trade union freedoms we’re looking to secure from an incoming Labour administration, whether that’s internal governance within the union, or of course the right to strike and the right to ballot our members outside of postal ballots. You need corporate governance and… a real say at work.

‘Corporate governance and a secretary of state for a Ministry of Labour. You’ve got to have someone at the table batting for 30million working people. And that’s a key fundamental element of any… new deal we want to secure within our party.’

Mr Turner said the spread of wealth in society was ‘obscene’.

He said: ‘Oxfam put in a report… on global wealth inequality. There are 85 people who have a combined wealth on this planet equivalent to the poorest 50 per cent on this planet. 

'I was accused of [wanting to] put them all on a London bus and wanting to kill them when I was talking in the House of Commons recently. 

'Of course that wasn’t the objective, if I was going to do that I would use a train carriage. You can’t get enough people on a bus.’ 

Tory MP Henry Smith said: ‘Weak Ed Miliband is now so deep in the union barons’ pockets he can barely look out.

‘In return for millions more in cash, Labour’s union paymasters are now even buying future Cabinet ministers.’

A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Unite’s job is to stand up for its members. The Labour Party’s job is to put forward the right policies for the country.’

Future: The new Ministry of Labour would be set up if Ed Miliband was to make it into Downing Street
