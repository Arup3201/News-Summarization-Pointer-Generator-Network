Mick Jagger's eldest daughter has emerged from the house where her bereaved father is believed to be staying as he plans the Los Angeles funeral for his fashion designer girlfriend.

Jagger, 70, landed in Los Angeles earlier this week after the Rolling Stones cancelled their planned Australian and New Zealand concerts following L'Wren Scott's death on Monday.

Jagger's eldest daughter Karis, 43, lives in Los Angeles with her husband and two children, and her house is reportedly being used as the home base as she and her stepsisters have gathered there to comfort their father.

Out of the house: Karis Jagger, the Rolling Stones frontman's eldest daughter, is seen leaving her house as it is reported that her father is staying there with her and her stepsisters as he grieves over the death of his longtime partner L'Wren Scott

Karis, 43, is a Yale-educated mother of two and grew close to her father after he admitted paternity following a lengthy back-and-forth with her mother Marsha Hunt

Karis, who graduated from Yale in 1992, was raised early on by her mother, model Marsha Hunt who battled with Jagger until he admitted his paternity when Karis was 12-years-old.

Partners: Jagger had been dating designer L'Wren Scott from 2001 until her death by suicide on Monday (pictured together in 2011)

The pair have since built their relationship, particularly given his choice to take solace in her home.

Jagger was in Perth on Monday night when news of his longtime partner's suicide in New York.

His daughters Georgia May and Elizabeth- sisters whose mother is Mick's second wife Jerry Hall- flew to be with him immediately and accompanied him to California.

The Rolling Stones plane refueled in 
Los Angeles before carrying on to England, but when it touched down in 
the U.K., Keith Richards was the only main band member on board.

Jagger's
 spokesman has since confirmed that the rocker has stayed in California 
and now has most of his children- Karis, Jade, Elizabeth, Georgia May, 
and James- by his side. (The only ones absent are his youngest sons 
Gabriel and Lucas, who are 16 and 14 respectively.)

The
 latest twist in the saga surrounding Scott's sudden suicide comes as 
her brother has reportedly agreed to allow Jagger to plan a West Coast 
funeral for her.

The couple began dating in 2001 after meeting when she was a stylist on a photo shoot featuring the rock superstar.

At
 the time, Scott had been living in Los Angeles and she maintained a 
home there in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood until 2009 when she sold 
the three-bedroom home for $860,000.

Family: L'Wren (center left) had become close with Jagger's daughters from previous relationships, including Jade (left) and Georgia May (center right) whose mothers are his first and second wives respectively

Glamor couple: Scott was a well-known designer in her own right but had become a more famous name since she took her relationship with Jagger public (seen together at the Met Costume ball in 2012 at left and in 2011 at right)

'I can’t help thinking, now, that a huge part of L’Wren’s spirit, what gave her grit and endurance, remained in the West. And without it, maybe she was maybe was a little lost, a little less sure of herself,' Scott's good friend Cathy Horyn, The New York Times fashion critic, wrote in a moving tribute to the designer.

Giving the OK: L'Wren's brother Randall Bambrough is reportedly allowing Jagger to hold the funeral for L'Wren in Los Angeles

She went on to recall how Scott would host dinners at the house, including a memorable outdoor Thanksgiving dinner with a number of Jagger's bandmates and their significant others in the home's walled garden.

Scott's body was found in her Manhattan apartment on Monday morning by an assistant who had reportedly been told to come over by Scott via text just moments before she killed herself.

Some close friends of the designer- including actress Ellen Barkin- went to the apartment and reportedly spent time with the body before the medical examiner removed it from the apartment.

Though spokesmen had confirmed the suicide hours after the body was found, the medical examiner ruled it as such on Wednesday.

Her body was claimed on Thursday but the medical examiner could not release the name of the individual who arranged the transfer to the Frank E. Campbell funeral home on the Upper East Side.

The funeral home, which regularly handles high-profile deaths like that of Jackie Kennedy and more recently Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is now reportedly coordinating a transfer of her body from New York to California after The New York Post revealed that her brother Randall Bambrough agreed to Jagger's wishes.
