Spencer Lacey Ganus was paid just $926.20 for her role as teenage Elsa in the wildly popular movie

Frozen actress Spencer Lacey Ganus was paid just $926.20 for her role as teenage Elsa in the wildly popular movie - despite the fact the film raked in more than $1.2 billion at the box office.

The 15-year-old, who voiced Elsa in some of the early scenes, received just a one-day guaranteed payment of the measly sum, TMZ reports. 

This was according to her contract which was filed in a court.

Ganus, who has also featured in similarly chilly films Ice Age and Happy Feet, only had a few lines in the animated blockbuster. 

But with the movie easily topping the billion mark, TMZ points out that her slice of the pie is a just a tiny 0.000077 per cent.

Broadway actress and singer Idina Menzel - now best-known for belting out Let It Go - voiced grown-up Elsa and the role of young Elsa was played by Eva Bella.

Frozen, based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen, overtook Toy Story 3 in March to become the highest grossing animated film of all time.

It grossed a record $1.2 billion at the global box office, making a huge profit on its relatively modest $150 million budget.

Let It Go, performed by Idina Menzel as Elsa, has also become a chart hit in countries across the world including the US and the UK.

The film sees fearless optimist Anna set off on an epic journey - teamed up with rugged mountain man Kristoff and his loyal reindeer Sven - to find her sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter. 

Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a snowman named Olaf, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom.

Frozen was in the UK box office top 10 for more than three months and now ranks as the 10th highest grossing film in cinema history.

The film won two Oscars, and its songs, penned by Broadway duo Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, topped the US Billboard 200 chart for 13 consecutive weeks. 

Disney has now started construction on a Frozen attraction, which will replace the Maelstrom at Epcot's Norway Pavilion, at The Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.
