The first pictures of a three-year-old boy who drowned in a swimming pool at his grandparents' Spanish home have surfaced as the parents wait to bring back his body.

Toddler Shae Colford was pulled from the family's swimming pool in southern Spain on Sunday - the first full day of his holiday. He reportedly died before doctors could treat him.

Shae, who had just celebrated his third birthday, was described by a relative as 'just lovely'.

Shae Colford had just turned three when he drowned while on holiday in Spain with his family, at his grandparents' home

Speaking to The Times, great-grandmother Marjorie Colford said: 'He was a lovely little boy, he was just lovely.

'Shae's mum and dad are still in Spain and they will be coming home as soon as the body is released.'

Shae, his baby sister Orla, and parents Jenna Naish, 27, and Daniel Colford, 29, were staying with Ms Naish's parents in Cartama, inland from Malaga.

According to the Times, a neighbour said the family, from Syston, Leicestershire, went on holiday as a late birthday treat for Shae, who turned three last week.

The neighbour said Shae was unmissable when he was running around because of his striking mop of blonde hair, and he had an 'infectious laugh'.

He also loved to wear a fireman's outfit, because, the neighbour thought, Shae's uncle was a firefighter.

'Shae was an adorable little boy, he was always laughing and smiling... The family are so sweet, this is just awful,' the neighbour is quoted in the newspaper.

Spanish media have described the tragic day as Black Sunday, after three people reportedly drowned in the country.

A man aged 50 was found dead, floating in the sea close to the coastal town of Torrox about 20 miles east of Malaga, and a woman aged 46 drwoned off the coast of Castellon, near Valencia.
