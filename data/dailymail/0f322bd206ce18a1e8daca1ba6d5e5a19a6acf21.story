A passenger train was 'hijacked' at a city centre station - by a lone man claiming to be from the CIA.

The train had just pulled in to Nottingham station, when the man jumped into the driver's cabin after he had left to speak with friends on the platform.

The would-be hijacker - who is believed to live with his parents in the city - managed to move the train 50 yards down the line before it came to a grinding halt.

A passenger train was 'hijacked' as it sat at a city centre station - by a lone man claiming to be from the CIA. The train had pulled in to Nottingham station, when the man jumped into the driver's cabin after he had left to go and speak to friends on the platform

The Sun reports that the panicked driver ran to front of the train where the man in his mid twenties was discovered operating the controls.

He shouted that he 'had a master key' enabling him to drive all trains - and that he had been ordered to commandeer the East Midlands service to Derby as part of his 'CIA duties'.

The driver called for police assistance and the man was questioned, but soon returned home to his mother and father.

A source told the paper that there was 'complete panic' at the station after the man was found.

Police said that he would be quizzed once again once officers had completed their other enquiries.

The train is believed to have been empty at the time of the takeover, save for another driver who was positioned at the rear.

British Transport Police said that they were called to the station at 11.40pm on Thursday August 28, after 'a member of the public briefly moved the train after entering the cab'.
