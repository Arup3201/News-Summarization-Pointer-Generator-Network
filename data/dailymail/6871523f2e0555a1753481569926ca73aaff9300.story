U.S. safety regulators are pushing for a nationwide recall of cars with potentially lethal defective Takata air bags, increasing pressure on the industry to move faster in a growing scandal. 

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also criticized Takata for what it called 'an unwillingness to move forward' on a recall, and said the company needs to be open with the U.S. public about the risks of its air bags.

Japanese supplier Takata and automakers have so far taken a targeted approach in recalling U.S. vehicles with air bags that can rupture upon deployment, shooting shrapnel into the car.

The earlier recall limited to several mostly southern US states needed to be expanded to the full country, said David Friedman, deputy administrator of the  NHTSA.

'We now know that millions of vehicles must be recalled to address defective Takata air bags and our aggressive investigation is far from over,' he added.

'We're pushing Takata and all affected manufacturers to issue the recall and to ensure the recalls capture the full scope of the problems.'

The agency warned that if Takata - subject of a US criminal investigation into its exploding air bags - and the manufacturers do not quickly make the recall voluntarily, it will use its powers to force one. 

On Tuesday it also ordered Takata to provide documents and other detailed information on the propellant used in its air bag inflators.

'In recent days, Takata has publicly conceded that it changed the chemical mix of its air bag inflator propellant in newly designed inflators,' the NHTSA said.

'As part of its ongoing investigation, the agency will analyze the information received to determine if the chemical composition of Takata's propellant mix may be a cause and/or contributing factor in the air bag inflator ruptures.' 

Five fatalities, including four in the United States, have been linked to the airbags. 

The U.S. regional recall involved 4.1 million cars hot and humid areas where the air bags may be prone to fail, including Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana and parts of Texas along the Gulf of Mexico. 

Most of those cars are made by Honda Motor, Takata's biggest client.

Ford, Honda, Mazda and Chrysler said they would continue to cooperate with NHTSA and plan to evaluate their call for a national recall. 

But each stopped short of saying they would expand beyond the current set of cars they are fixing. BMW is already recalling air bags nationally. 

Spokesman Alby Berman said Takata would cooperate with
regulators and automakers if an expanded recall is required, but
noted that 'of almost 1,000 passenger and driver inflators from
outside the high humidity areas that have been evaluated to
date, none have ruptured'.

'Takata is concerned that a national recall could
potentially divert replacement air bags from where they're
needed, putting lives at risk,' he said in a statement.

It's unclear just how long it could take to replace so many
air bags. NHTSA said it is pressuring Takata to ramp up
production of replacement parts and has said it will explore
using other suppliers to help with production if needed.

Takata has said it would add two production lines at its
Monclova, Mexico plant in January to make replacement air bag
inflators. 

Workers there have told Reuters that a single line
has a typical quota of around 200 inflators an hour, meaning it
could take five months to make 1 million inflators working
around the clock on two lines, five days a week.

U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, who is the chairman of the panel on consumer protection, supported a nationwide recall. She said if auto manufacturers did not comply she was in favor of forced measures.

'The confusion surrounding this air bag defect has gone on for too long,' she said.

'Today's announcement is overdue but welcome, and it's my hope that Takata and the other automakers that haven't yet done so will quickly agree to NHTSA's request - if they don't, regulators should force a mandatory national recall.'

The ratcheting up of pressure on Takata comes ahead of a Senate hearing Thursday at which top officials from Takata, Honda and Chrysler are scheduled to testify on the defect, blamed for several deaths and numerous injuries in the United States and elsewhere.

Friedman will also testify, with the agency facing growing calls to explain why recalls so far have been limited to only several US states.

Japanese firm Takata -- subject of a US criminal investigation into its exploding air bags -- has been asked to provide documents and other information on the propellant used in its deadly air bags 

In contrast, about 16 million cars worldwide from 10 automakers have been recalled over the defect.

Last month, in its initial warning, the NHTSA said that motorists in warm-weather US states should take 'urgent' action because the air bags were thought to have a greater risk of rupturing in cars operated in areas with high humidity.

In Tuesday's statement, the agency stuck by its view that cars in warm, humid climates are most likely to suffer the problem.

It said: 'While NHTSA is not aware of either field incidents or test data suggesting that the problem affecting passenger-side air bags in the areas of persistently high humidity extends beyond those areas, the agency has been pushing the industry to perform testing to ensure that current recalls effectively cover vehicles with air bags that could be potentially affected by this defect.'

Auto safety advocates and lawmakers said NHTSA's latest move
may still not capture the scope of the problem, is too late, and
may not be enforceable.

Democratic Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal said
they were pleased NHTSA recognized the 'national scope' of the
problem,' but said the call to replace driver-side air bags
should be expanded to also include passenger air bags.
