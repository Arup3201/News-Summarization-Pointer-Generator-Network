For June Thomson, 53, from Buckhaven in Fife, May is always the hardest month. For, on a sunny Spring day in 2008, two of her children were brutally murdered by her violent ex-husband.

Michelle Thomson, a disabled 25-year-old who needed round-the-clock care was stabbed 12 times while her little brother Ryan, just seven years old, was injured 14 times.

Now, almost six years later, Mrs Thomson says she will never get over their deaths and still feels guilty that she wasn't there to protect them.

Tragedy: June Thomson, 53, says she feels guilty every day for being unable to save her two children

Worse, she says, is living with the knowledge that her killer former spouse could one day be released from prison after being handed a life sentence with a minimum tariff of just 17 years.

'The sentence was disgusting - that made 
me sick to my stomach,' she says. 'How can you put a value on a child’s life, eight 
and a half years for a child, for two children who couldn't defend themselves and had their whole life in front of them.

'That is disgusting, 
the law is absurd.'

Mrs Thomson, who has two other sons, one of whom is estranged, first met Robert Thomson, known to his family as Rab, when she was just 17 years old.

Despite his previous convictions for violence and a controlling personality, she fell in love and in 1981, the couple were married.

Rab swiftly moved to cut off contact with June's friends and family and less than a year later, she was pregnant with daughter Michelle.

'When we first got married I never really
 got to see any of my friends, and I never got to see my family,' she remembers.

'We 
moved, he moved me up to Fife, and my sister did phone one day, because 
she’d been trying to get in contact with me, and he picked up the phone,
 told my sister not to contact me again and never to phone this number, 
so I had lost all family contacts as well.'

His violent temper, never far from the surface, resurfaced during her pregnancy and when Michelle was born with severe learning difficulties, he was furious.

Worse, as their family expanded, Rab began to turn his fists on the children - eldest son Shaun in particular.

'He’d batter me black and blue,' remembers Shaun. 'If I got caught smoking at school, he would take a belt and batter me with 
the buckle, I was just covered in bruises.

'I think he, like, enjoyed the power of it, 
being the one in control.  He made you scared of him.'

June too suffered regular beatings, frequently in front of the children who were powerless to help their mother.

It took another attack on Shaun for her to pluck up the courage to leave. 'It was one thing being violent to me, but it was a different thing being violent to my kids, so I just got the kids and I left,' she remembers.

But when she allowed Rab access to the three children, he spirited the family away to the Republic of Ireland, where he threatened to remain unless June came home.

Happier times: Although Rab was violent, the early years of June's marriage were relatively happy

'He said if I wanted to see the 
kids again I would need to promise to come back to him, so I did, 
because I knew if I didn't do that then he would have stayed in 
Southern Ireland and it might have took me years and years to get my 
kids back, and I couldn't cope with that.'

Back with Rab, June soon became pregnant for a fourth time, giving birth to her youngest son Ryan at the age of 41.

'When I found out I was pregnant with 
Ryan I was so shocked at first, but then I was happy,' she remembers.

'Everybody just 
adored him [when he was born], and Michelle just couldn't keep her hands off of him; she loved him and she was so motherly towards him.'

'My wee brother was everything to me,' adds Shaun. 'Me and my wee bro went everywhere 
together, we just had a really strong bond, and we were just always 
together.'

Despite her happiness, her relationship with the increasingly violent Rab continued to deteriorate and by the time Ryan was seven, it was damaged beyond repair.

When Rab threatened to send Michelle to a care home, June had had enough and began divorce proceedings.

A few days before a custody hearing on the 2nd May 2008, Rab arrived, angry and swearing, at June's new home.

'He came, and he’d said to me, 'What you gonna do when you’re all alone and you’ve no got any kids there?  You’ll just be all alone on your own" and I just laughed at him. I just assumed he was talking about him getting custody.'

When the hearing arrived, June was given full custody of the children but agreed to allow Rab access visits. That night, he phoned his eldest son Shaun, by then living in Essex.

'He’d said to Shaun that he wanted him to 
come up so that he could talk some sense into me,' remembers June,

'Shaun just told him, "My mum’s never going 
back to you" and that he was a monster and he hated him and 
he wanted nothing ever to do with him.'

'My dad was sneaky,' adds Shaun, 'and I knew that I would be his first target. Out of everybody I would have been his first.'

The very next day, June agreed to let Rab have Michelle and Ryan for the afternoon. When she dropped them off at his home on 3rd May 2008 at 3.30pm, it would turn out to be the last time she would see them alive.

'The last words I said to Ryan was "Right, okey-dokey, I’ll be back to pick you up just shortly", she remembers.

'And
 I went back a couple of hours later, just expecting to pick them up.  
Instead I found their dead bodies.

'Ryan was lying on the bed and his 
mouth was open, and his lips were blue, and I knew he was dead. I went through to Michelle’s bed and Michelle
 was dead, lying in her bed, and her eyes were open and her mouth was 
open and the whole room was just a bloodbath.'

Ryan, the first child to die, had been stabbed 14 times as he sat playing on a computer game. His sister Michelle had been attacked 12 times and had defensive wounds all over her arms.

Guilt: June, seen here leaving court, says she will always feel guilty about what happened

'That’s the bit that tortures me more 
than anything,' adds June. 'Knowing, you know, that he was killing them and they’d 
be wanting their mum there, and I wasn't there to protect 
them. 

'That’s the bit that tortures me all the 
time, that will never stop torturing me. Because I wasn't there to 
protect them.'

Shockingly, their killer father showed no remorse, even, according to the police constable who arrested him, attempting to control the police interview that followed.

'When Thomson came into our custody he 
was very matter of fact,' reveals DI Graham Fenton who worked on the case. 'He showed no remorse and he never asked for his children once.'

And although Rab was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 17 years at his trial, for his murdered children's mother and older brother, the nightmare continues.

'I just never, ever can describe the pain at that moment when 
I saw Ryan’s body,' adds June.  'I can 
never, ever describe that pain, it was absolutely 
horrendous.

'I can never, ever forgive him [Rab] for what he’s done, for taking the children’s lives. Why 
didn’t he just take mine and let them live?  I never, ever can forgive 
him for that. Never.'

'I
 was destroyed,' adds Shaun. 'Everything was wrecked, everything. I’ve lost a family; 
the only one I’ve really got left is my mum. That’s about it.'

'I still feel guilty, that guilt will 
never leave me,' reveals June. 'I don’t think there will ever be a time when I won't feel 
guilty for not being there when they really needed me to protect them. It’s like a living nightmare.'
