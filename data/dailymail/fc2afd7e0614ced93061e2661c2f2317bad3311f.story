The husband of the headteacher at a prestigious private school in Haiti has been kidnapped, officials have revealed.

Frank Jean-Baptiste was seized from his home in the nation's capital Port-au-Prince by men posing as employees of a package delivery service.

Mr Baptiste, a U.S. citizen, is the husband of Marie Jean-Baptiste, the director of the renowned Union School in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

The school is a private learning centre for the children of diplomats and wealthy Haitians.

U.S. Embassy officials said yesterday they are working on obtaining the release of Mr Jean-Baptiste.

Francois Dossous, the head of Haiti's anti-kidnapping unit, identified Mr Baptiste as the man who had been seized from his home, but would not provide any more details for security reasons.

Police and U.N. peacekeepers have increased checkpoints throughout Port-au-Prince in recent days.

Warning: The U.S embassy issued an alert about kidnapping on Twitter

On Friday, the day Mr Jean-Baptiste was kidnapped, the National Police of Haiti launched a vast research operation to strengthen checkpoints in Port-au-Prince and Petion-ville.

Last week two other people were seized, including a girl aged six.

On Saturday, the body of Haitian official Gilbert Giordanni was found on a street in Port-au-Prince after he had been kidnapped on Friday.

The U.S. Embassy has warned Americans working in Haiti to remain alert and has given citizens advice on what to do if kidnapped.
