Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has informed Qatar no amount of money can buy them a grand prix in the future.

The oil-rich Gulf state is ploughing billions of pounds into hosting the 2022 World Cup, whilst only recently it was awarded the 2019 World Athletics Championships.

The capital Doha already possesses a superb motorsport facility at Losail that hosts MotoGP and World Superbikes, and would require only marginal redevelopment to host F1.

Only last week the FIA held its annual gala in Doha, sparking talk of F1 staging a race at Losail.

Ecclestone readily concedes the Middle East could comfortably financially support three races per season, but there is a thorny issue.

Despite having held talks with Qatari representatives, with Bahrain and Abu Dhabi already on the calendar, they are in the driving seat and will not allow Qatar to join the party.

Revealing the details of the pact at an end-of-season briefing, the 84-year-old said: 'I've a bit of a problem, which nobody knows about really, but I'm sure they soon will.

'When we went to Bahrain I made a deal with the people there.

'They said to me that as they were going to be something new in the area, would I give them a guarantee I wouldn't stage another race in the Gulf, and I said yes.

'It was a typical Ecclestone handshake deal with the Crown Prince.

'But then Abu Dhabi wanted a race. I explained to them the position I was in, and I said to them, 'You better ask the people in Bahrain. If they're happy, I'm happy, if not, we won't (go)'.

'So they got together and that's what happened.

'Now this other race has been proposed, so I put the people together and said 'Can you sort this out between you?'. They haven't managed to do it.'

Asked whether Bahrain and Abu Dhabi have a right of veto over Qatar for as long as they stage grands prix, Ecclestone nodded and replied: 'Yeah.'
