The death of a University of Louisville cheerleader this summer has been ruled a drug overdose, with police confirming she was found in the apartment of a popular freshman footballer who has since left the college.

Danielle Cogswell, 22, was found dead July 28 in the off-campus Kentucky apartment of wide receiver Cameron Polk,  who was later kicked off the team for an unrelated drug charge.

Autopsy results have now shown Cogswell died of a lethal mix of heroin, amphetamines and the prescription drug Xanax, according to the police report obtained by WAVE3.

Cogswell's sister said she star athlete had battled a drug problem for the last two years and had, as far as the sister knew, smoked heroin two weeks before her death.

Overdose: Cogswell, described as an 'elite athlete', went to sleep in the apartment of freshman footballer Cameron Polk (not pictured) on July 28 and never woke up, police said

A witness told police she seemed high and 'slow' the night before her body was found.

She had been watching a movie with Polk in the bedroom of his apartment.

Polk told police Cogswell fell asleep early in the morning and he left the bedroom, falling asleep himself in the living room.

When he returned to bedroom about 9am, Polk said he found Cogswell unresponsive.

He panicked and had a roommate call 911, WAVE3 reported.

Police reported no foul play in the death of Cogswell during their initial investigation.

On October 7, about 11 weeks after Cogswell's death, campus police entered Polk's apartment and found marijuana, hydrocodone pills and codeine syrup.

Polk received a citation for trafficking a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of school as a result and was released by the school.

Dismissed: Wide receiver Cameron Polk, who was with Cogswell the night before she was found dead, has since been released from the university on a separate drug charge. He has not been charged in Cogswell's death

Disbelief: Friends of Cogswell, seen here with Drew Malone, are still in shock at her death

Beloved: Social media was flooded with messages of disbelief and grief at Cogswell's sudden death

Cogswell, who tranferred from the University of Arizona a year ago to be a part of the University of Louisville's cheerleading program, was described by the university's sports information director Kenny Klein as an 'elite athlete.'

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) requires regular drug testing for college athletes, but cheerleading is not part of the association and therefore team members do not undergo drug screenings, Klein told the Louisville Courier-Journal

'Obviously we're devastated at the loss of Dani,' Klein said at a media conference.'She
 was clearly, as you've seen from the photographs that are circulating, 
beautiful on the outside but that paled in comparison to her inner 
beauty. She was incredibly talented.''At
 the University of Louisville, as most people know, our spirit program 
is nationally and world-renowned. And Dani absolutely fit the bill for 
one of our elite athletes. She is definitely at an elite status within 
an elite program. She was on the upper echelon of our program here.' 

Troubled: Cogswell had issues with drugs dating back at least two years, her sister told police  

Using the hashtag #RIPDani, countless friends, teammates and acquaintances expressed their sorrow at her death. 

'My other half is gone. I know she will be watching over me,' wrote Daria Daspin.

The university was unable to confirm any further details surrounding Cogswell's death.

'The University of Louisville spirit program is devastated to lose one of our beautiful and talented team members,' spirit coach Todd Sharp said in a statement.

'Dani had a contagious smile and a spirit that would ignite the room. She will be greatly missed.'
