Police are believed to have located the father of the baby left for dead by a 30-year-old Samoan woman in western Sydney last November and are waiting to interview him.

Penrith Local Court was told on Friday that prosecutors in the case of attempted murder against the woman were waiting for a statement from the baby's father.

Daily Mail Australia has learned the woman had a boyfriend of Samoan ancestry, who may be the father of child. Police have yet to reveal whether the father was aware of the woman's pregnancy during the nine months she hid her condition from relatives and friends. 

During her pregnancy, the accused boasted about a new boyfriend and posted a photograph of the two of them on her Facebook page.

The NSW Department of Public Prosecutions is still gathering evidence for its case of attempted murder against the bay's mother. 

The DPP has yet to finalise interviews with staff at Blacktown hospital where the infant boy was born, medical and hospital records and CCTV footage from locations where the mother went after leaving the hospital and dumping the hours old child in the stormwater drain in western Sydney.

The accused, who has been held in Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre for seven weeks since her arrest for attempted murder of her son, did not appear via audio visual link from jail in Penrith Local Court during a very brief hearing before Magistrate Roger Clisdell. She is now due to next appear on March 13. 

 Friends of the woman have rallied around her posting messages of support on her Facebook page saying 'God will find an answer' and her situation will be resolved 'through prayer'.

The woman, who is the daughter of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor in Samoa, had been living with her aunt and uncle in the western Sydney suburb of Quakers Hill when she became pregnant and kept her condition secret for nine months.

After giving birth to a healthy baby boy at Blacktown hospital at 1am on November 18, she discharged herself early that afternoon and, police allege, took her baby and placed him in a stormwater drain around 500m from her home.  

The baby was apparently put through a small opening under the concrete slab over the drain and fell the 2.5m drop to the bottom.The baby lay undisovered for five days in hot dry conditions.

On the morning of Sunday, November 23, Sydney man David Otte and his daughter Hayley, heard cries coming from a drain as they were cycling near the M7 motorway.

They stopped, thinking it was a trapped small animal, and then called emergency services when they saw it was a baby. 

Police from Quakers Hill Local Area Command retrieved the baby, which was wrapped in a pink striped blanket, from the drain.

The five-day-old infant was taken to hospital, where it was found he was severely dehydrated and had bleeding on the brain. 

Now just over eight weeks old, the baby has been released from hospital and is in care. 

Doctors said the baby was able to survive in the drain because of a lack of rain causing storm water which might have drowned him, along with newborns' natural ability to survive without food or water. 

After police tracked down the mother, she was charged with attempted murder and has been held in a Sydney women's prison for the last three weeks. Magistrate Clisdell said the woman was still bail refused.

 While she has been accused of dumping her day-old baby down a drain and leaving him to die, the 30-year-old is also thought to be a loving aunt who adores children and appears entirely devoted to her family in Australia and Samoa, Daily Mail Australia can reveal. 

One of her social media accounts is filled with pictures of babies and young relatives. A family friend has told Daily Mail Australia that the young woman - who goes by an anglicised nickname and works in western Sydney - 'loves children and is very good with children'.

The son of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor, who leads the church attended by the woman and her family, told Daily Mail Australia that his father had spoken to the woman in prison late last year.

He said she 'was trying to keep on top of things' while incarcerated in a Sydney jail, believed to be the Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre.

He described her as a 'very happy person' who was 'very good around children and young people at the church'.

He said that she is 'a quiet girl' but that 'she's an island girl, so she's got a bit of bite in her' and that might help her cope while in prison awaiting trial for attempted murder. 

The accused's social media account also reveals that in the months leading up to the day the woman secretly gave birth,  the woman posted photo after photo of newborn relatives with loving messages.

'Happy  Eleven Weeks Princess', she has posted with double pictures of an infant dressed in pink.

In another post from earlier this year, below a photograph of her with a relative's baby, she says, 'Awww, it's mine'.

Another post with photos of the same baby dressed in a singlet and nappy has 'I love you' written with the accused's name next to it.

In earlier posts, the young woman's life appears to revolve around her work friends, family and the church.

Last year, she posted a birthday message to her aunt, with whom she was living in Quakers Hill until her arrest, saying 'Happy Birthday to the lady of our house an amazing, aunty, mom, chef ... hero!! Thank God for you [and] may our Good Lord continue to Bless you with many more years to come. Love you loads xox' 

The landlord of the house (pictured) where the young Samoan woman lived while hiding her secret pregnancy said he had  noticed she had 'put on weight' in the second half of last year

She also posted pictures of herself attending a church concert and celebrating birthdays with work friends.

In a posting in March last year of herself with a young boy she says 'happy 4th birthday to my son' and says 'cant wait to c u again' and 'miss u mate'. 

The landlord of the house where the woman had been living with her extended family for at least two years said he had noticed the young woman had put on weight in the second half of last year.

'I was delivering the water bill and I saw she was bigger and wearing loose clothes, but I didn't say anything,' he said.

'They are a very good family, clean. I see them with their Bibles.'
