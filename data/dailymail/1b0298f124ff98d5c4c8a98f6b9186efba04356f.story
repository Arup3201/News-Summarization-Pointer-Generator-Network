Bosses from Big Brother are facing criticism during the first week of the show, amid allegations of blasphemy, bullying, racism and swearing.

Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom said it had already received 209 complaints about the series in its first seven days.

Most of the complaints followed the explosive row earlier this week between Helen Wood, the former prostitute who had a threesome with footballer Wayne Rooney, and lingerie model Danielle McMahon.

An expletive-laden argument between Helen Wood and Danielle McMohan, 
pictured above, in which Helen was accused of being blasphemous, led to 
102 complaints from viewers to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom

The expletive-laden argument - which 
attracted 166 complaints - saw Helen, 27, criticise 25-year-old 
Danielle, from Glasgow, for her Catholic views by making comments about 
Jesus.

Helen first came to the nation’s attention in August 2010 after being involved in a threesome with England footballer Wayne Rooney and her friend Jenny Thompson.

The incident was said to have taken place at the Lowry Hotel in Salford in June 2009 - when his wife Coleen was pregnant with the couple's eldest son Kai.

The news rocked the football star’s marriage, but the pair were able to move forward from the scandal.

During the first week of Big Brother 9, which screened in 2008, Ofcom said it had received 505 complaints from viewers.

Most
 of the complaints - 361 - related to an alleged 'bullying' incident 
when four of the contestants had a heated argument about oven chips.

The
 row started when Alexandra De Gale allegedly abused Rebecca Shiner a 
nurse from Coventry, for burning the group's chip supper.

The most 
complained about event came in the 2008 Celebrity Big Brother,
 in which Ofcom received 44,500 complaints about the race row between 
Shilpa Shetty and Jade Goody.

Last year, the June Big Brother series received a total of 965 complaints. An Ofcom spokesman said 321 of those were made during the first week of the series.

In
 that series, viewers were outraged by housemate Jemima Slade getting an
 ‘unjustified' official warning for saying black men are not her type. 
Ofcom received 305 complaints in June that Slade, 41, had been 'unfairly
 accused of racism'.

In the 
series before that, in 2012, 2,088 complaints were received as the show 
became embroiled in another race and bullying row.

Conor
 McIntyre, an Irish fitness trainer, launched a foul-mouthed tirade at 
Deana Uppal, Miss India UK, after she became the only person in the 
house to fail an eating task, which prompted 1,108 complaints.

Now the salon owner is creating waves again, this time among Big Brother viewers for her behaviour.

The nature 
of the argument, which was watched by 1.3million viewers, already forced
 Channel 5 to pull the daytime repeat from the schedules - for the first
 time in the show's history.

The
 furious argument, which was aired on Tuesday, involved Helen telling 
Danielle - who says she lives by strong Catholic principles - to ‘stop 
s******g Jesus’.

Now Ofcom is assessing the complaints and deciding whether or not to open a formal investigation into the comments made.

After
 the row was shown, viewers accused Helen, 27, of blasphemy, with 
several Twitter users calling for her to receive an official warning 
from the show over her comments.

After the 
argument was aired, @laurxx123 tweeted: 'Oh my god if Helen Wood gets 
left on the big brother house after calling Danielle a fat b**** and 
bullying Chris I give up'.

Another
 user, ‏@JimmyPara1 said: 'If #bigbrother don't take action against what
 Helen said about Jesus, that would be a major error on their part'.

@xTigz tweeted: 'Helen on big brother is actually such a massive bully, why have they not removed her? Vile human #bbuk'.

And @julianhilaire tweeted: 'What Helen,said about Jesus was quite offensive she should apologise to Danielle and Catholics in general #BBBits'.

There has also been concern raised about Danielle making allegedly homophobic comments.

When talking about same-sex marriage, she told fellow housemates: 'The Catholic church don't believe in it and I go by what the Pope says.'

Helen's comments have angered viewers, who have expressed concern about some of the content in the first week of the series

Many have called for Helen, the former lover of Wayne Rooney, to be given a formal warning from show producers over her comments

There has also been concern about the 
racy content of the show, while other viewers have accused some 
contestants of ‘bullying’ fellow housemate Jale Karaturp.

It's not the first time Big Brother has landed in hot water over some of its controversial content.

The most 
complained about event after the notorious race row between 
Shilpa Shetty and Jade Goody, which was filmed as part of the 2008 series.

The comments were made during a row which was aired on Tuesday, less than one week after the 15th series of the show began

In total, there have been 209 official complaints about this year's series to Ofcom, while many have taken to Twitter to share their concerns

During the first week of Big Brother 9, which also screened in 2008, Ofcom said it had received 505 complaints from viewers.

The Ofcom spokesman added that the remaining 43 of the 209 complaints made so far this year had been surrounding other issues in the programme.

A
 spokesman for Channel 5 declined to comment on the complaints. A 
spokesman for Endemol, the show's producers, has yet to respond to a 
request for a comment.

The
 first eviction, which takes place tomorrow night, will see Jale face off against Danielle and 
Tamara Stewart-Wood.
