ESPN anchor Hannah Storm gave a glimpse of the burns and scars that she has following the barbeque grill accident that left her with second degree burns on her chest and face.

‘This is all fake,’ she told the hosts of The View this morning, lifting back hair extensions that were put in following her December 11 accident.

‘You can see the path of the flamemarks actually coming up my chest.’

Hiding the scars: The ESPN anchor appeared on The View on Tuesday morning and talked about how she is using many hair extensions now to make her look like her normal self

Promoting: Mrs Storm made an appearance on The View to help publicize Burn Awareness Week

The 50-year-old journalist proudly lifted the extensions and showed how tiny patches of real hair are beginning to grow.

‘It’s starting to come back!’ she said happily.

The accident occurred when she had been preparing dinner for her daughters on the outdoor grill. Because it was a windy night, the flame blew out and she did not wait for the recommended 15 minutes until she returned to reignite the grill, causing the explosion.  

She previously said: 'There was an explosion which blew the doors of the grill off. A wall of fire came at me, it was like a movie. I looked down and I saw that I was on fire.'

During this morning’s segment, she showed more pictures of her wounds while she was in the hospital as a part of Burn Awareness Week.

Damage: Storm shared pictures of herself in the hospital following the December 11 accident

She told the female co-hosts that in the moments when she was on fire at her home in Connecticut, one of her teenage daughters called 911 on her cell phone and was told by the operator to call back on a landline.

Storm laughed as she told the hosts that she thought to herself: ‘Does she even know how to use the home phone?’

Growing back: The shorter hair underneath her fake bangs is her natural hair beginning to grow back

Tuesday’s talk show appearance is far 
from her first since the accident, as she kept with tradition and hosted
the Rose Parade in California with Elliot just three weeks after the 
explosion.

The sports 
broadcaster spent an hour in hair and make-up ahead of fulfilling her 
commitment to co-host the January 1 Rose Parade in Pasadena for the 
fifth year running, a bandage on her left hand the only visible sign of 
the ordeal.

Like in previous appearances, she got choked up while talking about how her daughters helped her survive.

First appearance: Mrs Storm first returned to TV just three weeks after the accident when she co-hosted The Rose Bowl, which she has been doing for the past four years

Ordeal: Storm looked visibly upset as she told 
of how she tried to douse the flames shooting up her body and shouted to
her daughters to dial 911

All smiles: Storm and Elliot have co-hosted the Rose Parade for the past four years

She spoke of how much she had relied on 
her three daughters while recovering, adding tearfully that 'my middle 
daughter would wash my hair'.

Physical differences were not the only changes seen while she hosted the Rose Bowl for the fifth year in a row. Ms Storm is left-handed, and taking notes is almost impossible. Dressing and showering are challenges, too.

'I'm a little nervous about things I used to take for granted,' she said before the parade.

'Little things like putting on makeup and even turning pages on my script.'
