A mother of two shed half her bodyweight so that her young boys could fit their arms around her for a proper cuddle.

Max Freeman, 42, lost her brother in a motorbike accident when she was a teenager and turned to comfort eating as a way to control her grief.

But as the years passed she saw her weight rise to 22st 3lb and subsequently spent decades trying fad diets - and even dangerous slimming pills - to control her weight. 

Shrinking violet Mother-of-two Max Freeman chronicled her remarkable 11st weightloss over 18 months. She was spurred on to lose weight after she was too large for her sons to hug her

Max despaired of finding a method that would help her shed the pounds and watched her weight yo-yo through her 20s and 30s.

She was finally shocked into drastic weight-loss surgery when her boys Luke and Jack stopped hugging her because they couldn’t get their arms around her.

Max, who is just 5ft 5in tall, took the decision to undergo a gastric bypass and shed 11st in 18 months.

She proudly chronicled her change from a size 28 to a size 10 by taking a photo every time she lost another stone.

And with her weight down to 11st 2lb, nine year-old Luke and Jack, seven, can now give their mother a proper cuddle.

Hugs with their mother: Slimmer Max Freeman, hugged by her sons Jack and Luke, who inspired her to shift the pounds. She began comfort eating when her brother died in a motorbike accident when she was a teen

All together now: Max weighed in at 22st 3lb and her comfort eating problem meant she could only fit in size 28 clothes, but now she AND her sons can fit in them

Max, a former private hospital chef from Maidstone, Kent said: 'I lost my brother Darren when I was 16.

'He was only 18 and my mum was grieving and I was on my own a lot and I comfort ate.

'It just carried on from there. I was a massive chocoholic and pasta was my real comfort food.

'I tried everything and I was constantly on a diet or going to slimming clubs.

Beginning of her journey:  Max, pictured (L) at 22st and (R) at 21st, documented her weight-loss with a celebratory photo every time she shifted a stone

Shock: She was finally shocked into drastic weight-loss surgery when her boys Luke and Jack stopped hugging her because they couldn't get their arms around her (L) 18st, (R) 17st

'My weight was really getting me down and I wanted to be around to see my sons grow up.

'My doctor suggested the bypass. Having such a big operation was absolutely terrifying, but I’ve felt great ever since.

'I decided to take pictures as they helped me see how far I had come - I was amazed how quickly my body changed.

'My family have been really supportive and I think my brother would have been proud of me.

Loss: Max, a former private hospital chef, comfort ate after the sudden death of her brother when she was a teen. (L) 16st, (R) 15st

Feeling low: She said her weight was really getting her down and she wanted to be around to see her sons grow up, she tried diets and slimming groups (L) 14st, (R) 13st

Half her size: Medics re-routed her digestive system past most of her stomach, meaning she digests less food and feels full after smaller amounts (L) 12st, (R) 11 st

'Both my children can get their arms around me now. It is lovely. And I hope I am a good example to them.'

Max, who is married to painter and decorator Peter, 52, underwent the gastric bypass op at St Richard’s Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex, in November 2011.

Medics re-routed her digestive system past most of her stomach, meaning she digests less food and feels full after smaller amounts.

She now has three small meals a day with healthy snacks and even takes her sons to football practice early so she can enjoy a kick around with them before their training.

Love and hugs: She couldn't be happier with her slim new figure and loves sharing hugs with her boys

Different person: Max opted for a gastric bypass and decided to chronicle her weight loss as the pounds started falling off, which has changed her life

Active mother: She now takes her sons to football practice early so she can enjoy a kick around with them before their training
