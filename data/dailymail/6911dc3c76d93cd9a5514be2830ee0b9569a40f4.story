A bachelor dumped by a Ukrainian mail-order bride planned to take revenge by having her kidnapped and shipped to his home in a crate before poisoning her with lead.

Obsessed David Sartin, 49, struck up a relationship with blonde Elena Barykina after contacting her through a dating website and sending her $50,000.

He travelled to Ukraine six times to meet her believing that they would get married and live together in Hankamer, near Houston, Texas.

But the pair fell out when Sarin discovered she was sleeping with her Russian boyfriend Ark Ovrutski.

Infatuated: David Sartin, 49, admitted a plan to kidnap Ukrainian 'bride' Elena Barykina, right, then imprison her at his house after she dumped him

He tried to pay federal agents posing as a criminal gang $50,000 to kidnap Miss Barykina and deliver her to a specially adapted room in his home where he would get 'at least get a week out of her' before killing her with lead.

Sartin pleaded guilty last week in Beaumont, Texas, to attempted kidnapping and brandishing a firearm. 

The court heard how Sartin met Miss Barykina through dating website Dream Marriage which promised 'sexy' Russian and Ukrainian women.

He said he showered Miss Barykina with $15,000 in jewelry, including a diamond wedding set, and lavish trips across Europe.

He also paid for living and school expenses as well as photo shoots, record productions and a website for a singing career.  

The bachelor was also transferring money after she said she wanted to get a U.S. visa so she could emigrate and join an English school.

They agreed not to have sex before marriage because it is 'sacred'. But Sartin was furious when he discovered she was sleeping with her Russian boyfriend.

In July last year Miss Barykina sent him an email in which she broke off the one-sided romance.  

She wrote: 'David...I understand how it's difficult to you to realise that I cannot be your girlfriend.

'Please understand this. I am so sorry.. I try to offer all that I can - my friendship..I cannot give you more..Sorry.'

Following dozens more messages, Sartin hatched a plan to pay gangsters to kidnap Miss Barykina and have her shipped as a 'package' in a 'crate' to his home  

Sartin then said in phone calls recorded by the police he would 'take care of her' by 'lead poisoning'.

He planned to imprison her in a 
fortified room added to the side of his house.  He said he might later 
want to 'eliminate' her Russian boyfriend, according to the Houston Chronicle.

There are thousands of websites offering beautiful women from Russia and Ukraine seemingly desperate to find a western man.

But while some of these ads are genuine pleas for love, there have been many cases of men losing their money as they try to secure their 'bride'.

Letters between the two people are sent back and fourth before the 'bride' often raises the suggestion on money for plane tickets and visas.

The women prey on lonely men, and once they have money they can disappear or end the relationship.

The first warning sign for people using this method of internet dating is when the woman begins to ask for money. 

One man called Steve wrote online that the letters he was receiving from his 'bride' were actually generic ones from am agency.

'You can imagine how upset I was when I learned the truth,' he said.

But the 'kidnap' agents that Sartin were dealing with were from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives.  

On
March 6 last year he made a $25,000 downpayment and two weeks later 
went to a hardware store where he expected her to be handed over.  

Federal prosecutor Joe Batte said he was arrested carrying another $25,000 in an envelope, handcuffs, stungun and a pistol.

A
long rant posted by Sartin on the website Internet Scam Watch says how 
he 'supported' Miss Barykina 'as a good husband would do'.

He added: 'During all this time from then to now I have grown to love this person with all of my heart and it was not hard. '

He also posted online several of their email and SMS conversations in which they talk about her moving to the U.S.

Sartin's father Cecil, 73, said he had warned his 'lonely' son about the relationship but 'she was prettier and could talk sweeter than me.'

He added that after the kidnapping plot 'in the back of his heart, I think he was still hoping they might have a life together.'

Meanwhile, Sartin's wealthy ex-wife said he had received $400,000 from a divorce settlement with her.  

Retired oil-executive Betty Sartin, who was married to him for 11 years, said: 'I was 13 years older than him, and he played me for a fool. Now he's met somebody a little smarter than him.'
