A 19-year-old man was tonight charged with the murder of teenager Hani Abou El Kheir, Scotland Yard said.

Hani, 16, was stabbed to death on the edge of Pimlico, one of London's most affluent neighbourhoods, last Sunday in an attack by a group of at least 10 people.

Ahmed Mikhaimar, 19, will appear at Redbridge Magistrates' Court in north east London tomorrow morning charged with his murder.

Victim:Â  Detectives, who believe at least 10 youths were involved in the brutal murder of Hani Abou El Kheir (left and right) have arrested nine people in relation to the attack by a gang wielding swords and knives

Horrific: The 16-year-old died from multiple stab wounds after he was set upon on the edge of Pimlico, one of London's most affluent neighbourhoods, last Sunday evening

Two other teenagers arrested on suspicion of Hani's murder were today released on bail while four other people were bailed last night.

A man aged 48, a woman of 47 and two girls aged 16 and 17, who were arrested on Saturday on suspicion of assisting an offender were bailed to a date in March, Scotland Yard said.

Two boys aged 16 and 17 arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday were today bailed to dates still to be fixed, while a 18-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday remains in custody.

A 20-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of murder last Thursday and was bailed until late March.

Officers were called to reports of a youth stabbed in Lupus Street shortly before 7pm on January 27.

The teenager, who lived on the nearby Churchill Gardens estate, was taken to King's College Hospital but died later.

A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as multiple stab wounds.
