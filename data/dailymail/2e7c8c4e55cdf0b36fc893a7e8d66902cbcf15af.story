While limited-edition holiday drinks have become a festive tradition, many of them contain unhealthy levels of fat and sugar. 

But one high street chain has brought out a slimming one-calorie Christmas spicy coffee - so you actually lose weight just by drinking it. 

The Yuletide coffee is infused with flavours of Christmas candy, dried fruit and hints of pine and therefore needs no sugar, milk or syrup.

Harris+Hoole's Yuletide coffee - which has only one calorie - is infused with flavours of Christmas candy, dried fruit and hints of pine and therefore needs no sugar, milk or syrup to sweeten it 

The seasonal beverage is available at Harris+Hoole's 45 stores across the UK

With barely more than a calorie, the new coffee is available at Harris+Hoole's 45 stores across the UK.

And as calories are burnt just in the act of drinking and digesting the coffee - you are using up more calories than are actually in the cup.

This naturally fragrant coffee, cultured by one of Harris+Hoole's growers in Panama, uses the 'Honey process' to help keep the natural sugars from the coffee cherry.

This means the coffee beans, which are a type of fruit, retain their sweetness, and the resulting drink needs no added syrup, toppings or cream to lend it such.

Jochem Verheijen, head of coffee at Harris+Hoole, said: 'With overtones of candy, pine, the dried fruit of Christmas cake and even a whiff of wood smoke, everything in this filter coffee is reminiscent of the best bits of Christmas.

'The mastermind behind it, Graciano Cruz, is something of a God in the coffee world as his new process helps beans retain even more of their natural sweetness.'

The result is a calorie-free Christmas coffee with flavours that speak for themselves.

Mr Verheijen added: 'Christmas feasting is hard enough on the waistline.

'A coffee doesn't need to add to the calorie overdose by being packed with sugar.

'Just as you wouldn't use a fine bottle of plonk to make mulled wine, a coffee this good needs no added sugar.'

A recent MailOnline study of high street coffee chain festive drinks found major brands like Costa Coffee and Starbucks had high sugar and high calorie contents.

Out of 20 different festive drinks on sale at Starbucks, Costa Coffee and Cafe Nero, just four had less than a woman's daily recommended sugar intake of 25g (approximately five teaspoons).

The worst offender - a Starbucks skimmed Honey and Almond Hot Chocolate with whipped cream - contained a 'shocking' 61g or 15 teaspoons - the equivalent to around two Mars Bars. 

A grande Honey and Almond Hot Chocolate from Starbucks - made with full fat milk and topped off with a frothy crown of whipped cream - contains 524 calories.

This is a quarter of a woman's daily allowance (2,000 calories) and more than the 508 calories nestling inside a McDonald's Big Mac.

Meanwhile seven of the skinny drinks - Starbucks' chai tea latte, Honey and Almond Hot Chocolate (without whip), Toffee Nut latte (without whip) and Peppermint Mocha latte (with whip), and Costa's Roasted Hazelnut, caramel and chai lattes - had more sugar than their full fat equivalents. 

The World Health Organisation recently reviewed its guidelines on how much sugar should be incorporated into a healthy diet.

While it has previously recommended men consume no more than 70g and women 50g a day, those guidelines have been slashed to 35g and 25g respectively.

This equates to no more than nine for men and six for women.

Diets high in sugar can increase a person's risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay. 

Dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline while it is important for people to indulge in a festive treat at this time of year, they should be considered just that - a treat.

The danger, she said, is that people popping into their local cafe will choose a tempting festive special and not realise the number of calories it contains.

'People go into coffee shops thinking, 'I'll just grab a coffee',' she said.
