The sequence lasted only two minutes, but the transformation of Buckingham Palace into rows of flats, terraces and council blocks - as Madness played their hit Our House - was one of the more original and intriguing parts of the Diamond Jubilee concert.

The effect, seen by 17â€‰million TV viewers, was achieved by a clever light show - and the images projected on to the Palace were of real homes lived in by ordinary people.

We tracked down some of the buildings and showed photographs of the TV images to people who live there. Most were surprised - and delighted - to learn of their unexpected moment of fame.

The sequence opened with an image of a Seventies council block - in reality a neglected three-storey block of flats in Camberwell, South-East London.

Gambia-born Ousainou Sarr, 45, a restaurant manager who has a flat on the ground floor, saw the designers had cleverly used blue and red lights to disguise the block's crumbling white plaster and paintwork.

'It's amazing,' said Mr Sarr, who didn't recognise his home, even though he was actually in The Mall at the concert.

The image of the flats in Benhill Road was used three times in the show and Mr Sarr was so excited that he immediately broke the news to his girlfriend Anna Lucas, 27, a chambermaid, originally from Romania, adding: 'I'm going to tell all my family and friends.'

A couple of miles away, a Fifties block on the Kinglake estate in Walworth was used to depict an inner-city estate.

The animators made it look grittier by daubing the front with graffiti. Single mother Nicola Williams, 28, who has a two-bedroom flat there, said: 'I'm really pleased. I thought the housing looked a bit like mine but had no idea it was.'

The light show was created by specialist firm Trunk Animation, and designed to highlight the communities that make up Britain. Other housing was based on internet pictures of the Stonehall council block in Plymouth, the terrace in TV's Coronation Street, and a Georgian terrace in Islington, London.
