At his side for interviews and public appearances, Camille Cosby has steadfastly stood by her husband Bill.

As dozens of allegations pile up against the comedian - two more women came forward this week claiming they were assaulted - some question how Camille can keep up appearances.

Page Six reports that one family friend, Revered Carl Dianda, who married the couple and saw them last at their 50th wedding anniversary last year, believes Bill is innocent of the alleged abuse.

Loyalty: Camille Cosby, 69, has endured rumors of husband Bill's bad behavior for years, but friends are puzzled by her loyalty as numerous women come forward with claims of drugging and sexual abuse

'I will help Camille and Bill in any way that they want me to. I’m not going to be embarrassed to say anything. What I know is what I know, and Bill has never done anything to embarrass anyone,' Dianda said. 

Still, unnamed friends claiming to have been close to the couple in the past spoke of being confused about Camille's silence as more allegations come to light.

A sorority sister from Delta Sigma Theta attested to Camille's character, telling Page Six that she was 'by no means weak.'

'But it’s puzzling why she’s put up with it. She’s a self-made woman. She didn’t need Bill Cosby. You can say that Bill Cosby needed Camille Hanks.'

Another family friend said he wasn't surprised the clergy would support Cosby, considering the family has played a strong role in the Washington, DC, Catholic Church.

'You’re not going to hear Father or anyone associated with the church publicly speak out and put their names on it no matter how bad this gets,' the friend said.

'Almost every year, Bill and Camille come in at some point, whether it’s the anniversary, a concert, a trip to Ben’s Chili Bowl, or just to visit.'

'They get all of us together, and we have a blast. But you can tell that he has a roving eye. He always has, and Camille knows that, too.' 

But as allegations move beyond infidelity to claims that the comic drugged and assaulted numerous women, friends question how long Cosby's wife can stay quiet by his side. 

The list of women grew this week, as exotic dancer Chloe Goins, 24, came forward saying she blacked out at the Playboy Mansion in 2008 from a drink Cosby gave her, and came to only to see the comedian sucking her toes and touching himself.

Another woman, identified only as Lisa, told Dr Phil she was drugged in 1988 in Cosby's hotel room, waking up days later in her own bed with no recollections of what happened in between.

The two alleged victims join almost two dozen women who have already come forward, including model Janice Dickinson and former Playmate PJ Masten. 

'I know that in speaking with her — and we’re usually honest with each other — she seems to believe that the women will be exposed eventually so it’s best not to say anything,' Camille's sorority sister said. 'But maybe the eventuality of her husband being exposed has arrived.'
