Gabriel Aubry has failed in his bid to overturn an order banning him from seeing Nahla.

The French-Canadian model appealed to a Los Angeles court on Tuesday to lift an emergency protective order issued in the wake of his brutal Thanksgiving fight with Olivier Martinez.

The order banned him from going within a 100 yards of the four-year-old, her mother Halle Berry and Halle's fiance Martinez.

TMZ reported that Aubry, 36, was not granted his request to have the order ended immediately.

Instead it will now expire on Thursday. Initially the order ran until December 3, but the judge acknowledged a clerical error meant it was only valid for two more days.

Should Halle wish to extend the order than she will have to appeal to the court by Thursday.

Initial reports erroneously stated that the order had been lifted.

The
ruling came as Halle was seen looking deep in thought and shielding 
herself behind her sunglasses as she dropped her daughter off at school.

witnessing the brutal scenes.

Halle's mother spoke out on Tuesday, saying she hoped 'things calm down'.

Former nurse Judith told CelebBuzz: 'This cannot go on things have got to calm down.'

And she added: 'I hope that things get better, I really hope that they do; they have got to get better.'

But when asked how her daughter was she replied: 'As far as I know Halle and Nahla are fine though.'

The fight followed a bitter custody dispute which saw Halle fail in her attempt to move to Paris with her daughter.

Both
men have claimed that they were attacked by the other.

While Aubry was 
arrested and charged with battery after the confrontation he also came 
off worse for wear, sporting a shockingly bruised black eye and various 
injuries.

On Monday he obtained a restraining order against Martinez, who he says should never have been involved in the handover.

According
to a sworn declaration within his restraining order application, the 
previous night Martinez had threatened him as the three watched Nahla in
her school play.

Before the fight: On Wednesday Gabriel Aubry had attended a Thanksgiving party alongside his ex Halle Berry and her fiancé Olivier Martinez

Aubry 
alleges Martinez whispered in his ear: 'I wish I could beat the s*** out
of you right now.

'You're lucky we're in a school right now. We're going
to take Nahla right now and you're not going to follow us.'

Aubry
also alleges that when he arrived to drop off Nahla
at 10am Martinez told him they needed to talk before following him to 
the car where he attacked him.

He says that even before the fight things had seemed unusual.

'I
remember thinking that is was odd for [Olivier] to be there, as he is 
generally not present during custody transition,' he said.

It has been reported that Aubry now plans to ask the judge to ban Martinez from seeing his daughter.

'Gabe has had enough, he has now 
twice been accused of criminal behavior resulting in his recent arrest 
after a fight with Olivier Martinez on Thanksgiving,' a source close to 
the situation told Radaronline.

'Gabe will ask the judge to prohibit Martinez from having any contact with Nahla.

Gabe will also ask the judge to 
re-instate his visitation with Nahla after Halle obtained a protective 
order after Gabe's arrest which doesn't allow him to have any contact 
with his little girl.'
