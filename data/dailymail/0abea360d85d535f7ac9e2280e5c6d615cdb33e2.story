Two years ago, English expatriate Patricia Wilson disappeared from her house in South West France - her body has never been found 

It is two years since English expatriate Patricia Wilson disappeared from her house in South West France, and the police arrested her gardener and sometime lover. The trail of blood and destruction suggested a brutal murder.

Jean-Louis Cayrou, 52, who was arrested for her alleged murder after traces of Patricia’s blood were found in his car, remains in custody, yet no date has been set for a trial. Her body has never been found.

And only now – after it was sealed off as a crime scene – has her partner been able to move back to the house they shared in an attempt to press police to bring her killer to justice, and to find her body.

Speaking exclusively in the sitting room of the pretty stone farmhouse in the Aveyron area that they bought six years ago, former businessman Donald Marcus’s voice drops to a whisper as he points to the far end of the house.

‘She was killed in the adjoining barn and dragged through the kitchen diner into here before her body was pulled down through the French windows and down the steps into the garden,’ he said.

‘There was a massive sweep of blood showing the trail. The house was trashed, everything upended and flung around as if someone was in a rage.’

The scene – which triggered a huge air and land search in this deeply forested countryside criss-crossed by rivers and jagged ravines – is clearly still vivid in the 56-year-old’s mind.

He was back in Britain seeking medical treatment when Patricia, then 58, disappeared, and the gruesome scene was described to him by friends who went to the house after becoming worried she had not been seen.

Cayrou has denied killing Patricia despite evidence of DNA found in and on his car that matched that of the vivacious brunette, claiming he had stumbled across the bloody scene and fled because he feared he would be blamed.

‘I had the house industrially cleaned before I set foot in it again,’ Donald says. ‘I’ve come back because I want justice for Pat.

‘I have no doubts she was murdered her and I beg the killer to tell us where her body is.

‘If they don’t, I will never be able to put her to rest. My life is invested in this house – it is all I have left. But I see what happened here vividly and I have to think: “It is just a house, the house we loved.” I have nowhere else to go. My whole life is here. Tied up in this house.’

Former advertising executive Patricia met Donald in 2004 at a pub in Yorkshire. They fell in love and built a house together and got engaged – she had never married and he was divorced and childless.

Donald Marcus, who moved to rural France with Patricia after they met in 2004, was in the UK receiving treatment for multiple sclerosis when Patricia was killed

Later, they decide to move to rural France in search of a stress-free, healthier and happier life.

Money was not a problem. Their house sold for £400,000, Pat cashed in a £115,000 pension pot to add to her savings and Donald sold his business renovating old properties for £185,000 to add to his own substantial savings.

They pinpointed Aveyron in the Midi-Pyrenees, a sparsely populated, though tourist-driven area with its gorges and medieval towns and villages.

They fell in love with Les Landes Basses, a wisteria-clad fermette with outbuildings and 11 acres including a small river and lake near the village of Vabre-Tizac.

They paid £260,000 at the height of the market and spent a further £85,000 on renovations. With the French housing market in freefall, Donald has been told it is now worth less than £150,000.

Back then it seemed perfection. ‘Who could not love it?’ he says. ‘We were so happy. There are a lot of ex-pats here and we quickly made friends. We were very social and enjoyed the relaxed way of life. We worked together on the house.

‘I read we were victims of “living the dream”. We weren’t – we knew exactly what we were doing and could afford to do it. And then I became ill and everything stopped.’

Several months before Patricia disappeared, Donald returned to England after he started to lose feeling in his legs, frequently falling.

‘It was embarrassing,’ he says. ‘The French doctors seemed baffled so I decided to go home. Pat stayed here and I didn’t realise I would be away for so long. I took one small bag.’

In Leeds he was diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis with no chance of remission. He is now confined to a wheelchair with limited movement from the chest down, barely able to pull himself on to a sofa or bed.

He sleeps at one end of the sitting room, having converted an adjoining space into a wet room.

A specially equipped and modified van allows him to shop and visit the local bar for company.

‘I was always coming back,’ he says firmly. ‘When I told Patricia on the phone of the diagnosis, she burst into tears and said she would convert the downstairs around me and then I could come home. She never wavered in that.’ 

But as Donald stayed in England seeing specialist after specialist, Patricia turned to an itinerant local man, Cayrou, who lived in a caravan, for help with heavy jobs and the garden.

Police believe they became lovers in the April and he moved into the house. She told at least one friend it was finished with Donald and he would not be returning.

Friends suggest she had a turbulent, at times violent relationship with Cayrou and threw him out three months later, four weeks before her death. He couldn’t accept it and pestered her constantly by phone, even breaking into her house to frighten her, with his hand on her throat. She became increasingly worried for her safety.

Donald says he knew nothing of the drama and still spoke regularly by phone to Patricia while planning their new adapted future.

‘I knew nothing of any lover until she disappeared – was killed,’ he claims. ‘But I don’t blame her and never have. I don’t judge her – I love her. She was a woman alone dealing with this house.

‘It’s said that he’s nice and charming and, well, she was vulnerable. These things happen.’

Speaking in a monotone voice caused by his condition and heavy medication, Mr Marcus is a shadow of the vibrant, fit man who arrived in France filled with dreams of a new beginning with the woman he had fallen in love with four years earlier.

‘Who would have believed when we set off for France that it would end like this?’ he says. ‘Every time someone says, “well, it can’t get worse,” I tell them: “Oh yes it can.” Yet if I could go back in time and do it all over again – I would.’

Later this month, Donald will attend a hearing for an official certificate of death to be issued. He says: ‘Because we were not married my rights are limited. Our joint account and thousands of pounds of my money has been frozen and can’t be released until she is declared dead. I just want what is mine.’

Donald is certain he will end his days in the house he and Pat adored. He talks of having a ‘wake’ for her next spring. ‘I haven’t had time to grieve,’ he adds. ‘Maybe that will help, even if there is no body.’
