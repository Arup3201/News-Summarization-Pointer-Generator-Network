An American homeowner desperate to sell his $10million mansion has offered a $50,000 bonus to anyone who is able to find a buyer.

The resident of the 100-acre 'Harmony Mountain' has decided to get rid of the property after spending $24.5million building the dream house, which has five bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and enough space to park ten cars.

He has now offered a cash incentive of $50,000 to whoever manages to sell the place, currently on the market in Philadelphia for $9,995,000, which includes a $2 million art collection.

The spokesperson for Sotherbys reiterated that it was not unusual for agents who sold properties to be handed commission.

He explained that usually owners hand over three per cent commission to whoever manages to sell their property.

But on this occasion, the owner, who is keen to sell, is offering an extra $50,000, or 0.5 per cent, to the successful seller.

He said: 'The $50,000 is an additional bonus to the three per cent commission offered by owner, usually you need to be a real estate licensed person to get paid in the US.'
