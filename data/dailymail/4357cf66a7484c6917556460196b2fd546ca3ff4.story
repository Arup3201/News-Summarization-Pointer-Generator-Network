Throughout 2014, £1,860 a day was spent on Bristol City Council procurement cards including £686 on iTunes downloads

Staff at a council used payment cards to spend nearly £700,000 of public cash – including £170 on a pair of designer Ugg boots, £100 in a Ralph Lauren store in Barcelona and £44 in a tattoo parlour.

The cards are intended for expenses including travel, office supplies and catering. But thousands of pounds were spent on fast food, iTunes and shopping trips abroad last year.

Throughout 2014, £1,860 a day was spent on Bristol City Council procurement cards, figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show.

Overall, £680,000 was spent by council workers, with more than £4,200 on eating out, £9,664 for hotels at home and abroad, £37,894.11 online at Amazon and £686 on iTunes downloads.

The 'outrageous' spending even included Gay Times magazine, Krispy Kreme and fishing tackle.

The council insisted the figure for a one-off £189.50 payment to Gay Times magazine was incorrect, and it actually spent £33 on a subscription to Diva magazine, a lesbian magazine, for its library service. 

A council spokesman said £32,400 spent in Asda paid for groceries to support people in respite care, and £10,000 spent in Ikea was to support tenants in high-needs accommodation.

It failed to provide a proper explanation for £170 spent on a pair of designer UGG boots, £100 in a Ralph Lauren store in Barcelona and £44 in a tattoo parlour. 

Procurement cards are given to senior managers, some school heads, managers of care homes or social workers who need to supply goods to vulnerable people.

Councillor Geoff Gollop, deputy mayor, said: ‘We have processes in place to reassure ourselves that corporate cards are used appropriately. 

'What you see is a council running its business, supporting vulnerable people and helping those who don’t always enjoy the same advantages as others.’

'Outrageous': Staff at Bristol City Council used payment cards to spend nearly £700,000 of public cash – including £170 on a pair of designer Ugg boots

Despite trying to defend the spending, the use of procurement cards has been slammed.

Chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance Jonathan Isaby said some of the payments revealed in the figures were 'outrageous'.

He said: 'The council must come clean about why these payments have been made, because they appear to be totally inappropriate.

'Taxpayers hand over their hard-earned money to the council for essential services - not for swanky restaurants, trips to the office and snooker outings.

'It is outrageous that taxpayers' money is being used in this way and the council must hold people accountable for the spending.'

Local Government Minister Kris Hopkins said: 'Bristol City Council should be focusing its efforts on making sensible savings to keep Council Tax down and improve frontline services.'
