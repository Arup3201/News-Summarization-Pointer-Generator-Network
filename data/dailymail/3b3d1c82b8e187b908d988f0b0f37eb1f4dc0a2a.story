Former Virginia governor candidate Creigh Deeds is fighting for his life after he was brutally stabbed by his own 24-year-old son, who then killed himself - just one day after the younger man was committed to a psychiatric ward but released because there were no beds available.

Deeds, a state senator, has been upgraded to fair condition at University of Virginia hospital after he was found stumbling away from his home in rural Bath County, Virginia, by a cousin who happened to be driving by.

Deeds was stabbed multiple times in the head and torso and lost large amounts of blood. He was initially flown to the hospital in critical condition.

The veteran Democratic state legislator's son Gus was found shot dead inside the family home.

Gus had been evaluated by psychiatrists at a mental hospital on Monday, but could not be committed because there was no room at any mental health wards in all of western Virginia, according to reports.Â

The Highland County Recorder reports that Austin 'Gus' Deeds attacked his father before shooting himself in the head at the politician's home in Millboro Springs.

Police have not commented on a motive.

Gus had been a student at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, which he attended off-and-on since 2007. He took a semester off school in 2009 to help his father with his losing campaign for governor.

He was enrolled this year, but withdrew from the university last month. Administrators said he was a music major with a 'strong academic record.'

On Monday, he was evaluated by psychiatrists in Williamsburg after an emergency commitment order was filed against him, a source told the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

He was only released because there was no room for him at any psychiatric wards in western Virginia.

On his Facebook page, Gus listed his political views as: 'Too busy with love to care.' He was one of four children of 55-year-old Deeds.

Gus was arrested for alcohol possession in May 2009 when hew was 20 after police caught him at a house party near his home.

Deeds is being treated at the University of Virginia Medical Center and is listed in critical condition.

He was flown 
to the hospital. Gus Deeds was found alive in the house, but he died 
before he could be stabilized and put on a helicopter.

'Virginia
 State Police are on the scene of an assault of a state legislator that 
took place Tuesday morning,' authorities said in a news release.

'Senator
 Creigh Deeds has been transported to U.Va. Hospital in Charlottesville 
for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the assault at his 
residence.'

Despite his extensive wounds, Deeds has been able to speak with investigators and give them information about the attack.

Deeds rose to national fame during the 
2009 Virginia governor's race in which he lost by a landslide of nearly 
18 percentage points to Bob McDonnell.

He and his wife of two decades, Pam, 
divorced in February 2010 after the embarrassing loss turned him into a 
punchline in some political circles.

Deeds said his marriage to Pam, right, fell apart because of the rigors of his political career. The two divorced in February 2010

In 2010 he told the Washington Post that the divorce was 'a casualty of a nearly 20-year pursuit of a lifelong ambition that kept him away from home.'

He married Siobhan Lomax in a quiet ceremony in June 2012.

Lomax,
 44, owns a boutique near the campus of Washington and Lee University in
 Lexington, Virginia, where Deeds has been a visiting law professor 
since 2010.

Condolences immediately began to pour for Deeds and his family.

Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Shultz tweeted: 'Thinking and praying for Creigh Deeds and his entire family. He's a great man and public servant.'

Governor Bob McDonnell, a Republican who beat Deeds in the governor's race in 2009 and for attorney general in 2005, also offered his condolences.

'In this tough and sad time, our thoughts and prayers are with the Deeds family. The news from this morning is utterly heartbreaking,' McDonnell said in a statement.

'Creigh Deeds is an exceptional and committed public servant who has always done what he believes is best for Virginia and who gives his all to public service.'
