England batsman Nick Compton has left Somerset by mutual consent.

The South Africa-born 31-year-old, who signed a three-year contract in 2013, has insisted his desire to relocate to south-west London is behind his decision.

He explained: 'I have loved playing for Somerset, but I have decided to relocate more permanently to my base in south-west London.

The South Africa-born batsman signed a three-year contract in 2013 but has decided to leave the club

'I have always set myself the highest of professional standards, and I don't want to compromise myself or the club, going forward.'

Compton joined Somerset for the 2010 season after representing Middlesex - whose home ground of Lord's has a stand named after his grandfather, Denis - between 2004 and 2009.

The move was a success and he was given a Test call in 2012, going on to play nine Tests.

However, Compton did not feature in the 2013 Ashes series and he has seen the likes of Adam Lyth, Sam Robson and Alex Lees move ahead of him in the queue for a Test place.

Compton's international future was not done any favours by his omission last month from the Lions squad for the forthcoming tour of South Africa.

He continued: 'I appreciate Somerset's understanding of my wish to balance both my personal and professional life.

'The club will always have a special place in my heart and I owe (former Somerset director of cricket) Brian Rose a huge debt of gratitude for the privileged opportunity he gave me to become a Somerset cricketer, which in turn has enabled me to fulfil a number of cricketing goals.

'Thanks to everybody who has made me so welcome in the last five years.

'I have been part of some exceptional teams, experienced the warmth of Somerset's amazing supporters who make it such a great club to play for, and wish everybody connected with Somerset Cricket continued success.'

Compton's decision to leave Somerset will come as a blow to the Taunton-based club 

The news is certainly a setback for Somerset. Compton topped their Championship batting averages in 2013 and has scored 5,140 first-class runs for the county an average of nearly 56.

Somerset chief executive Guy Lavender said: 'We would like to acknowledge the contribution Nick has made to Somerset during his five years with the club.

'He will be missed and we are disappointed he has decided to leave. He departs with our very best wishes for the future and with our thanks for his outstanding contributions on and off the field.'

The county's current director of cricket Matt Maynard added: 'I am sorry to see Nick depart as he is a quality cricketer.

'But it is fundamentally important that he, or any player for that matter, wants to be here and is able to perform to the best of their ability. Sadly this is not something Nick feels able to achieve at this time.'
