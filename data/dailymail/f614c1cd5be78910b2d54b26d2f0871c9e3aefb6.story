Seth Kraft had an 18th birthday to remember on Saturday when he starred in his high school’s senior nights basketball game and even scored to ensure a massive victory over their local rivals.

At 4ft 1in, Seth isn’t a regular starter for the team, but his passion for the sport means he has been the boys basketball student-manager and student-coach for the Laurel High School's varsity team for the past four years.

As a token of appreciation for all Seth's hard work and dedication to the team, coach Pat Hansen decided to play him in Saturday’s game against local Montana rivals Billings Senior.

Pre-match, Seth helped lead his teammates on the floor and broke through a sign crafted by the cheerleaders with this message: 'Seth, you never fall short of amazing us.'

‘I will steal the ball if I have the chance,’ Kraft told the Billings Gazette before the game.

‘I’m not going to take it easy on them. It’ll be great if I score, but it’s OK if I don’t. I’ll be successful tonight if I make an impact, even a small one.’

He needn’t have worried, after missing his first shot Seth connected on a short attempt late during his two-minute stint.

Both sets of fans responded with a loud ovation for Seth's first - and only - career points as Laurel won 75-66

As student-coach, Kraft would go over with each player where they were supposed to be when the team, the Locomotives, were running their offense.

'He has incredible knowledge of the game,' said Hansen. 'We listed him this year as a student coach. He does a lot of basketball stuff (as an aide to his coach for two periods during the school day).

'He doesn’t do water and towels. He’s part of the team. It’s an opportunity he more than deserves.'
