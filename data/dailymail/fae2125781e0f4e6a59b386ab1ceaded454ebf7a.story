It was an unprecedented 19-hour operation to wrench a 1,000ft-long liner from its side where it capsized and pull it completely upright.

And this minute-long time-lapse video reveals the impressive Â£500million parbuckling effort to right the Costa Concordia off the Italian island of Giglio.

Salvage experts started the rotation of the ship yesterday at around 9am, before the cruise liner was finally laid to rest on an underwater mattress today at 4am.

The project now allows for a renewed 
search for two bodies never recovered from the 32 dead, and for the ship
 to eventually be towed away.

The
 Concordia's submerged side suffered significant damage during the 20 
months it bore the weight of the ship on the jagged reef.

The operation to right it stressed that flank as well. Exterior balconies were mangled and entire sections looked warped.

The
 damage must be repaired to stabilize the ship so it can withstand the 
coming winter, when seas and winds will whip the liner.

Beginning: Salvage experts started the rotation of the ship yesterday  outside Giglio harbour around 9am

Overnight: Engineers worked on the wreckage during the night as the parbuckling operation continued

Finished: The stricken Costa Concordia is upright after the parbuckling operation was completed at 4am today

Shortly after 4am, a foghorn boomed off Giglio Island and the head of Italy's Civil Protection agency, Franco Gabrielli, announced that the ship had reached vertical.

It was a dramatic operation that unfolded in real time as TV cameras recorded the final hours when the rotation accelerated with gravity pulling the ship into place.

For Italy, it was a moment of pride after the horror and embarrassment of the crash in January 2012.

The Concordia slammed into a reef off Giglio Island after the Italian captain brought it too close to shore in an apparent stunt.

He earned the public's contempt when he abandoned the ship before everyone was evacuated, and then refused coast guard orders to go back on board.
