It's been three weeks since Dan Osborne was heard threatening to stab his ex-girlfriend - and the mother of his one-year-old son Teddy - Megan Tomlin in an audio recording.

But a second audio, handed over by Megan, 23, this week and released by The Sun On Sunday, hears the 23-year-old TOWIE star make another expletive-laden rant, threatening to end her life.

Dan, who was arrested but released by Essex Police without charge after the last incident, also refers to his second child Ella, born last month with Jacqueline Jossa, as a 'mistake.'

Recorded: A second audio recording has been released which hears TOWIE star Dan Osborne threatening his ex-girlfriend, and the mother of his child Teddy, during an expletive rant

Dan and Megan split in April 2013, shortly after the birth of Teddy, and the reality TV star then started dating EastEnders actress Jacqueline before announcing they were pregnant in August 2014.

Now though, an audio-taped recording - heard by MailOnline and allegedly secretly taken by Megan last November at her home in front of their young son - sees Dan refer to her as his 'property' and threaten her if she moves on with another man.

He is heard saying: 'I swear on this boy’s life I will end your f****** life if you shag another man. Never in your f****** life are you going to be with another man. I can swear on my son’s life.'

Split: Dan Osborne and ex-girlfriend Megan Tomlin split in Aprul 2013 and have a one-year-old son together Teddy

'Shut your f****** mouth you f****** c***. If you go near another man I promise you I will stab you in the f****** throat.'

Dan made similar threats of physical violence in the first tape released earlier this month but in this latest release Megan can be heard exclaiming, 'Ow, get off me!' and tells Dan to stop 'hitting' her until she seems distressed and in tears.

There is no proof that Dan actually hits Megan in the recording. 

After asking him to leave her house, he admits, 'Yes I am horrible when you go on about other men' telling her that as long as they have a son together, Megan is his 'property'

Bouncing back: Following the release of the first audio recording, in which Dan was heard denying he was dating current girlfriend and the mother of his second child Jacqueline Jossa, Dan is now back in his relationship and expected back on TOWIE

Throwback: Megan and Dan are now the parents of Teddy, who is one year old

Dan can be heard telling Megan that she can't get a new boyfriend even though he's made another girl pregnant because that was a 'mistake' and he didn't 'mean' to get 22-year-old Jacqueline pregnant.

Megan tells him that it's laughable because having a child doesn't get more permanent but he says things would be different if he 'actually wanted a family with [Jacqueline]' or if he was going to 'propose' to her.

'I don't care. It won't be funny when you're in hospital,' he says, and referring to a future boyfriend he adds: 'If I'm going to go to prison, I'll stab him in the throat.' 

A representative for Dan Osborne has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.

The previous recording also heard Dan deny having a relationship with Jacqueline, despite her being pregnant with their daughter at the time of the alleged first recording.

Dan appears to have patched things up with the mother of his second child, as he was this week pictured with Jacqueline on a date.

Sharing an intimate kissing picture to his Twitter page, Dan wrote: 'A night with this beauty' 

The reality TV star was also reportedly due to return to The Only Way Is Essex following a brief suspension, though Lime Pictures have confirmed that Dan will not be receiving a new contract any time soon.

A spokesperson for the ITVBe show told MailOnline on Sunday: 'Dan has not been on the show for several weeks and there are no plans for him to return.' 

To apologise, Dan released a statement eight days after the initial audio was released, pleading for understanding and appearing to confirm that it was his voice which featured in the expletive rant.

He said: 'It has taken me a while to find the right words but I would like to say that I am truly sorry to anyone who was offended by what they heard.'

'I am ashamed and embarrassed that I allowed myself to reach such a dark place that I behaved in a way that even I didn't recognise.  

'While I acknowledge that there is absolutely no excuse for my deeply regrettable behaviour, I plead for some understanding that I had no intention of violence.' 

Father's defense: It was Dan's dad Jim Osborne who was the first to defend him on social media on Sunday

Dan and Megan dated for 18 months in 2013 but have remained close for the sake of their son, who was born in December 2013.

Jacqueline and Dan have now been together for over a year and she gave birth to baby Ella on February 16. 

It was Dan's father Jim - who previously reportedly branded Megan the 'scum of the earth', and a 'tramp' on his Facebook page according to The Sun - who leaped to Dan's defense on social media on Sunday.

He said: 'We all love you Dan, beautiful person inside and out xxx' before Dan quoted his tweet and added the line, 'love you too dude! If only everyone knew the full story eh x'

Words of advice: Dan's dad was previously quoted as saying that he thought Megan was the 'scum of the earth', and a 'tramp' on his Facebook page
