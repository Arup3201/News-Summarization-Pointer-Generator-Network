The words 'life imitates art' ring true for one California festival.

This summer, performers at Pageant of the Masters dressed up as figures from famous artworks, The New York Times reported.

The staged recreations at the event, which is part of the Festival of Arts of Laguna Beach, are called 'living pictures,' the newspaper pointed out.

Artistic: Volunteers dress up every year as famous artworks at Laguna Beach's Pageant of the Masters

Makeup, wigs, and costumes are all used to give the volunteers a look that closely resembles the original famous paintings and sculptures 

The staged recreations are known as 'living artworks' 

The performance is set off by '[a]n outdoor amphitheater, professional orchestra, original score, live narration, intricate sets, sophisticated lighting, expert staff, and hundreds of dedicated volunteers,' according to the pageant's website.

This summer, the theme for Pageant of the Masters was 'The Art Detective,' which its website claimed '[would] reveal how lost treasures were discovered, where crimes of passion were uncovered (or covered up) and how creative riddles were unraveled, with a gallery of the world’s great masterpieces providing the clues!'

This summer, Pageant Director Diane Challis Davy told The Orange County Register 'This art detective theme has been on the back burner for several years. It is really quite coincidental that there’s so much in the news these days about World War II art, and lost and stolen art. So our show will open with scenes of art that disappeared, and art that went into hiding during World War II.' 

Actors' costumes are carefully painted to mimic the original artist's brushstrokes, and sets are painted to include the landscape and background features.  

Pageant of the Masters uses two volunteer casts, and some of the members have participated for years

Some of the paintings that were recreated this summer with live human actors included Rembrandt's 'Nightwatch,' Piete Bruegel the Elder's 'Blind Leading the Blind,' Emanuel Leuze's 'Washington Crossing Delaware,' Edouard Manet's 'Olympia,' Vermeer's 'The Concert,' and John Singer Sargent's 'Portrait of Madame X,' according to a program published online.

Among the sculptures were a variety of Egyptian scuptures, as well as Johannes of Bologne's 'The Rape of the Sabine Women' and Benevuto Cellini's 'Perseus with the Head of Medusa.'

This year, film posters from the 30s and 40s were also recreated with the performers, including those from film noirs 'Double Indemnity' and 'The Maltese Falcon.'

The New York Times reported the event grew out of a 1930s parade where artists dressed up as famous figures from art.

'The Pageant of the Masters sells out almost every night, more than 50 performances every summer, and this year took in close to $1 million after expenses,' The Times said. 

It also uses two volunteer casts, and some of the them have participated for upward of twenty years, according to the newspaper.
