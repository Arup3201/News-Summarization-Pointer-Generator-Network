Attorney General George Brandis' membership of a men's only club has sparked a rowdy, chest-beating display in the Senate.

Labor used question time on Thursday to embarrass Senator Brandis over his invitation to join Melbourne's men's only Savage Club, asking him to sing the club song and demonstrate the initiation ceremony. 

Senator Brandis unsurprisingly declined.

Labor members used question time on Thursday to embarrass Attorney General George Brandis over his invitation to join Melbourne's men's only Savage Club

'As the minister is responsible for anti-discrimination laws, can the Attorney General explain why his new club doesn't accept women as members, or is it because he believes sexists have right too?' Labor's Stephen Conroy asked.

His comment was in reference to Mr Brandis controversially saying earlier this year he said people had the right to be bigots.

Mr Brandis hit back calling the question 'flippant' and telling Mr Conroy to 'grow up'.

Another Labor senator, Doug Cameron, then stepped up to spell out some of the club's initiation details.

'He joins a club that has some bizarre rituals, that are unbelievable in a modern country,' he said.

'Bizarre rituals that require members, when they are greeting a new member, or when a new member is being initiated, to make guttural noises and beat their chests.

'This is what the Coalition frontbenchers are engaged in - it's like Tarzan calling on Jane.'

Several Labor members started rowdily beating their chests as the Attorney General watched on.

The Savage Club in Melbourne says it has no chest-beating ritual, despite Senators acting it out in Parliament

Liberal Bill Heffernan took it upon himself to stroll across the chamber and gently beat Mr Cameron on the chest as he explained the initiation. 

A bemused Senate deputy president Gavin Marshall later called on Mr Heffernan to explain his antics.

'I thought he was choking on his haggis,' he said, referring to Mr Conroy's Scottish heritage. 

Senator Brandis unsurprisingly declined when he was asked to sing the club song in the chamber

Labor's Stephen Conroy kicked off the rowdy debate by asking Mr Brandis why the club didn't except women

The Savage Club says it has no chest-beating ritual.

Following accusations he was sexist, Mr Brandis revealed he belonged to three clubs, two of which allow both men and women.

'There is nothing against the law of Australia for there to be for example women only golf clubs, nothing against the law for there to be men's clubs, nothing against the law for there to be mixed clubs - nor should there, nor is that sexist,' he told the Senate.
