It's a classic newsroom blunder which appears to have slipped through the cracks.

The Age has incorrectly printed a photo of 'Legally Brown' comedy star Nazeem Hussain in its entertainment column today with the caption: 'Waleed Aly joins The Project'.

The awkward mix up was spotted by the stand-up comedian, of Sri Lankan descent, who lightheartedly tweeted on Thursday morning: 'Well, we are kinda the same person...'

It has since gained more than 500 retweets, sparking comments such as: 'Brown people all look alike', 'Un-freaking-believable' and 'demonstrates why tv needs more non-white face'.

This follows last week's announcement that Aly secured a new role as the new co-host of Channel Ten's news program The Project.

It was announced last week that Waleed Aly will be co-hosting The Project next year

Aly, born and raised in Melbourne to Egyptian parents, is a frequent commentator on Australian Muslim affairs and has often spoken on the topic several times on ABC political show, Q&A. 

He is also a regular contributor for The Age.

When searching his name on the Melbourne-based newspaper's website, alongside his correct head-shot it states Aly 'writes fortnightly for The Age'.

The lawyer, 36, is no stranger on The Project and will be joining existing co-hosts Carrie Bickmore and Peter Helliar on the panel next year.

He will succeed Rove, who will leave the show after a pre-determined six month stint this month.

Aly appeared once a week on the program as a guest this year, but speculation was rife that he would take over from Rove after the end of his ABC roles this month on shows including The Big Idea.

It will also be an Australian first for TV as Aly becomes the first Muslim to co-host a major prime time television show.

Ironically, his so-called lookalike - Nazeem Hussain - is the creator and star of Australian television show 'Legally Brown' which presents a comedic take on life as a Muslim in Australia.

The 27-year-old is also a presenter on triple j radio.

Aly will start his new role on The Project from January 26.
