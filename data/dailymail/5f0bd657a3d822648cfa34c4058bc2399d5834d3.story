Teachers who set Shakespeare to hip-hop to appeal to young people was today condemned as ‘viciously racist’ by a youth mentor backed by ministers today.

Education Secretary Michael Gove invited Linsday Johns to address the Tory party conference on the inane, dumbed down methods used by some schools to make the classics more relevant to young black children.

Mr Johns hit out at the use of street slang, hoodies, baggy jeans and baseball caps to make English lessons ‘achingly cool’.

Anger: Youth mentor Lindsay Johns used a speech to the Tory conference to condemn attempts to make literature classics cool

Mr Gove has faced criticism from some teaching unions for insisting pupils study literature classics by ‘dead white men’.

But Mr Johnson backed the idea, insisting Shakespearean plays should be studied in their original form without ‘positively evil’ attempts to appeal to youth culture.

He also accused opponents of Mr Gove's reforms who ‘piously’ advocate a more inclusive curriculum display ‘staggering levels of hypocrisy’ as they have often enjoyed a ‘Rolls-Royce, Oxbridge humanities education’.

Mr Johns is a writer and broadcaster who runs a youth programme in Peckham, south-London.

He said the ‘pernicious rush to relevance’ in classrooms was actually harming the children it is designed to help.

Mr Johns told the conference in Manchester: ‘Floundering as we now are under the Sisyphean burden of political correctness, teachers are hell-bent on making everything achingly cool and hip as they think that this is the only way young people will engage and learn.

‘This obsession with relevance is not only massively condescending but it's also shooting the very people it is ostensibly setting out to help in the foot.

‘The truth is Hamlet does not need a hip-hop soundtrack for young people to enjoy it or understand it. It's been doing just fine for the last 400 years.

‘It's not only incredibly patronising but also viciously racist to think that black and brown kids in the inner cities will only get Shakespeare if it's set to a hip-hop beat and presented in three-minute MTV Base-style chunks.

‘It is positively evil to deny inner city kids access to the manifold joys of hearing their national poet's true voice, in essence their birthright, simply because of a culture of low expectations.

‘With absolutely staggering levels of hypocrisy the overwhelming majority of those who denigrate the canon and who piously advocate a more inclusive, easier, “down wiv da kids”, curriculum are often metropolitan liberals who have themselves enjoyed the massive intellectual and social benefits of a Rolls-Royce, Oxbridge humanities education, with what's more, I'll wager, absolutely no hip-hop whatsoever.’

Mr Johns said it was ‘blindingly obvious’ that an academic curriculum focused on the classics would better enable young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their potential.

Black and ethnic minorities who read classic white authors should not be accused of ‘selling out’, he said.

Mr Johns told the conference: ‘You can of course be fiercely proud of your Jamaican, Ghanaian or black British roots and ardently love Horace, Boccaccio and Milton.

‘The two are in no way mutually exclusive and they certainly don't make you any less black or less brown by reading them.

‘Only an intellectual amoeba would assert that studying the canon is tantamount to selling out, to being a coconut or an Uncle Tom.’

He went on: ‘I'm so tired of the vacuous PC educationalists and the hand-wringing liberals that take great offence at Michael Gove's championing of a bunch of dead white men and what they perceive to be arcane, difficult books. Books which they claim have no relevance whatsoever to modern multicultural Britain and to the lives of Tommy, Dwayne, Abdul or Nadeen in the inner cities.

‘As any sane, sentient and intelligent person knows those doing the carping are speaking utter nonsense.’

He went on: ‘To deny kids in the inner cities access to such mind-expanding, life-affirming and potentially life-changing authors is not only undeniably selfish and wrong but is actually positively nefarious.

‘That there is a positive correlation between an academically rigorous canonical curriculum and enabling young people, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to truly achieve their potential in a highly competitive, modern world is frankly so blindingly obvious that even Stevie Wonder could see it.’
