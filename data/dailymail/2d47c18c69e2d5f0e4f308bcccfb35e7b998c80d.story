Tipping the scales at a staggering 38 stone, Craig Wood was morbidly obese, having racked up £15,000 debt to satisfy his £200-a-day addiction to takeaways.

The 31-year-old admits he even shoplifted chicken wings, stuffing them in his trousers to gorge on when he got home.

His diet was laden with sausage rolls, deep fried treats, chocolate and biscuits - washed down with pints of lager, Baileys and Jack Daniels.

But after undergoing gastric band surgery on the NHS, Mr Wood has shed 20st - and now weighs 18st.

His body mass index (BMI) was 61 - almost three times the recommended range of 18.5 to 25. 

Craig Wood, 31, from Hereford, tipped the scales at a staggering 38 stone - almost quarter of a tonne 

He now weighs 18 stone after undergoing weight loss surgery on the NHS. He said doctors told him he had to lose nine stone before he was eligible for the operation 

Mr Wood racked up £15,000 debt spending around £200 each day on takeaways and pints of beer

The electronics technician admits he would shoplift chicken wings from supermarkets, stuffing packets into his trousers to feed his addiction to fat-drenched foods

His chest measured 78 inches, his waist 58 inches and he wore a size XXXXXXXXXL shirt.

The electronics technician said: 'I'd always been overweight, and by the age of eight, teachers were pulling me out of lessons to tell me that they were worried about my size. 

‘My mum would cook normal-sized portions, but I’d spend all of my pocket money on chocolate and secretly scoff biscuits in my room.

‘I remember when I was 13 and there was a promotional offer on Snickers, where you could win a pair of David Beckham football boots. 

'I pretended that I was buying loads of Snickers to win the boots, but really I just wanted to eat them.’

By the time he left school, Mr Wood was morbidly obese.  

Unable to find a job, Mr Wood spent five years housebound, rarely leaving home.

He said: 'I was too big for interviews, so I just couldn’t get a job. Employers would judge me as soon as I walked into the room.

But after undergoing a gastric band operation on the NHS, Mr Wood has shed 20st and now weighs 18st

‘So instead, I’d stay inside and play computer games all day, eating sandwiches and drinking fizzy pop.

‘And when I did go out, I’d guzzle down takeaways, beer and Baileys with ice - spending up to £200 a night.’

While he played the joker with his friends, Mr Wood said he was miserable and  ashamed of his appearance.

Worse still, he had racked up an eye-watering £15,000 debt, overspending on food.

Mr Wood, from Hereford, said: ‘I was disgusted with myself. 

'Strangers would come up to me in the pub and say: ‘Good God, look at the size of you.'

‘I didn’t need to be told I was massive - I already knew. Every time I looked in the mirror, I could see just how enormous I was.

‘It got the point where I knew my friends were embarrassed to be seen with me, and they stopped inviting me to things.

‘But I still couldn’t stop eating. I even shoplifted chicken wings from supermarkets to fuel my addiction.’

The turning point came in July 2007, when Mr Wood was struck down with meningitis and only one friend came to visit him in hospital.

He said: ‘I realised then that I was throwing my life away. I didn’t have a career, or friends or a girlfriend.

‘I had almost died, and only one person cared enough to come and visit me.

‘Everyone around me was getting married and starting a family, and I knew this was something that I would never have unless I did something about it.’

Mr Wood visited his GP, and was horrified to learn that he weighed a massive 38st - nearly a quarter of a tonne.

At 61, his BMI was almost three times the recommended range of 18.5 to 25 and he was at serious risk of having a heart attack or developing diabetes.

In 2009, he was referred to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, where he was advised that a gastric band would be best option.

Although he was eligible for the operation on the NHS, Mr Wood was told he had to lose more than nine stone before he was allowed to undergo the two-hour operation in June 2012.

He has called for more to be done to help people with a an addiction to food. He said: ' At the end of the day, an addiction is an addiction. If I had been addicted to heroin, I think I would have been taken more seriously'

The turning point came in July 2007 when Mr Wood was admitted to hospital with meningitis and just one person came to visit him. He said he realised he had no job, no friends and no girlfriend as a result of his weight

Mr Wood said: 'I’m so grateful that I’ve been given another chance, and I’ll never let myself go again'

Diet before: 

Breakfast - nothing

Lunch - Sausage roll, flapjack, cheese sandwiches and a fizzy drink

Dinner - Sausage, chips, beans and egg

Snacks - Cheese, chocolate, biscuits, crisps, Baileys, beer, Jack Daniels and Coke

Diet now:

Breakfast - Apple 

Lunch - Ham and mixed leaf salad with peppers

Dinner - Vegetables with Philadelphia sauce

Snacks - Yoghurt 

Today he called for more to be done to help people with a food addiction.

He said: ‘People think that surgery is the easy option, but it really isn’t. 

'I had to go to months of counselling and lose a lot of weight before the surgery.

‘For weeks after the operation, I could only eat yoghurt and drink milk.

‘At the end of the day, an addiction is an addiction. 

'If I had been addicted to heroin, I think I would have been taken more seriously.

‘Food is something that people have to be around every day - it isn’t a case of just stopping eating. 

'I have now had to learn how to eat all over again.’

Now having lost a massive 22 inches from his waist and even one shoe size, Mr Wood is looking forward to a new, healthy future.

He said: ‘I’ve been left with a lot of loose skin, but that’s a small price to pay for getting my life back.

‘I’m so grateful that I’ve been given another chance, and I’ll never let myself go again.’
