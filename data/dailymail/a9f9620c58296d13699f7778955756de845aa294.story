Lewis Hamilton made it four pole positions in five races this season as he again left Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg trailing.

With Mercedes again proving to be way ahead of their rivals, Hamilton finished 0.168 seconds ahead of Rosberg as the all-conquering force in Formula One again locked out the front row of the Spanish Grand Prix grid.

As long as he keeps his nose clean, Hamilton is likely to win Sunday’s race after a brilliant performance in qualifying.

Great start: Hamilton has secured pole in four out of the five races this season

For all the talk of upgrades to the 
cars of rivals at the opportunity offered by the first race of the 
European stage of the season, Mercedes have seemingly maintained their 
significant advantage over the rest.

Nobody can live with them: Daniel Ricciardo, of Red Bull, was third fastest, a full second back from Hamilton.

‘I’m
 very disappointed,’ said Rosberg. ‘I don’t particularly like coming 
second to Lewis. I did a good lap but he did a better job.’

There
 is a danger, implicit in what Rosberg said, that Hamilton can waltz to 
his second world title. He has won three of the four races, the only 
blip being a technical malfunction at the opening round in Melbourne.

Rosberg
 won that race and was runner-up at the next three, meaning that he 
takes a four-point lead into today’s race in Barcelona.

Hamilton
 has not led the standings since he did so fleetingly in 2012. ‘That was
 my one small taste of leading the championship for some time, but 
otherwise I don’t remember the last time,’ he said.

‘As
 long as you’re leading when you cross the finish line at the last race,
 that’s what counts. But it’s my goal to get in front and stay there.’

Hamilton
 accomplished his pole position feat despite having problems with his 
machinery. He came on the radio to say: ‘I don’t know how but we’ve made
 the car worse.’

Disappointing: Sebastian Vettel failed to set a time in Q3 at Circuit de Catalunya after stopping on track

He later 
explained: ‘In practice we had such a great car and often when things 
are that good you don’t want to change much. But we changed a few things
 over night in the hope of making things a little bit better – small 
things, like half a millimetre here and there.

‘But today they car was a real handful.’

The
 same could be said of the world champion, Sebastian Vettel. The gearbox
 of his Red Bull failed, condemning him to start 10th and adding to a 
season of woe. How he must be irked by the performances of his team-mate
 Ricciardo. ‘I'm quite disappointed,’ said Vettel.

It
 was a dismal day, too, for McLaren. Jenson Button was eighth fastest – 
impressive in the circumstances – and his rookie team-mate Kevin 
Magnussen 15th.

The 
feel-good factor that came with Ron Dennis’s return is dissipating. It 
will take time for the structural changes that are slowly evolving to 
take full effect.
