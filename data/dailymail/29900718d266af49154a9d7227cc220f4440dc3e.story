Carole Middleton - the mother of the Duchess of Cambridge - was one of the victims of phone hacking by the News of the World, it has today been reported.

She joins a list of other associates and members of the Royal Family who were revealed throughout the trial to have had their voicemails intercepted by NotW journalists.

It comes after a jury has failed to reach verdicts on two outstanding charges against former editor Andy Coulson and journalist Clive Goodman.

Carole Middleton - the mother of the Duchess of Cambridge - was one of the victims of phone hacking by the News of the World, it has today been reported

The jury resumed deliberations on the case of the ex-No 10 spin doctor today as the political fallout from his conviction for plotting to hack phones at the News of the World raged in Westminster.

But jurors concluded they could not agree and were discharged after nine days’ deliberation and 139 days of the trial.

Coulson faces up to two years in prison when he is sentenced next week along, after he was found guilty conspiring to hack phones over six years.

The former spin doctor, who was forced to resign as David Cameron's director of communications over the scandal, now faces the possibility of prison.

His ex-lover and colleague Rebekah Brooks was cleared of all charges.

Amid
 the gravity of the accusations, the eight-month trial revealed 
fascinating details of the private lives of the Royal Family.

They 
included revelations that Prince William used the pet name ‘babykins’ 
for Kate Middleton in a phone message hacked by the News of the World, 
and that he was nearly shot with blank rounds after getting lost and 
walking into an ambush while on an Army training exercise in woodland 
near Aldershot in Hampshire.

William also apparently left a 
voicemail on Prince Harry’s phone in which he pretended to be his 
brother’s then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy and called him a ‘big hairy fat 
ginger’, and that Miss Davy drove Harry ‘nuts’ with a barrage of calls 
and texts while he was training to be an Army officer, according to News
 of the World royal editor Clive Goodman.

William
 was allegedly kicked out of Harry’s passing-out party at Sandhurst in 
2006 for ‘braying Hooray Henry’ antics, according to Mr Goodman. And 
Princess Diana allegedly leaked information about the Royal Family to 
journalists to reveal the forces ‘ranged against her’.

Prime Minister David Cameron apologised for hiring the former tabloid editor after the Old Bailey jury convicted Coulson of being part of a six-year hacking conspiracy but cleared his ex-lover and colleague Rebekah Brooks.

The eight women and three men of the jury were considering allegations that Coulson, 46, of Charing, Kent, conspired with former royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, of Addlestone, Surrey, to commit misconduct in a public office by agreeing to pay police officers for two royal directories. They both deny the two charges.

Mr Justice Saunders, who has already made clear his frustration with politicians commenting on the case before it has finished, told the jurors today it was 'extremely important ' that they followed his direction to ignore entirely anything they had heard on the radio, seen on the television or read in newspapers, no matter who said it.

Coulson was recruited by Chancellor George Osborne to head the Tory media operation within months of resigning as News of the World (NotW) editor in January 2007 because hacking happened on his watch.

When Mr Cameron entered Downing Street, he took on duties heading the No 10 spin operation, quitting shortly before he was arrested when the phone-hacking scandal erupted again four years later.

Final day: Coulson was mobbed as he arrived at the Old Bailey today before the jury was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the final two counts he faced

Conviction: Coulson is likely to face up to two years in prison and will likely be sentenced next week

Following the verdict yesterday, Mr Cameron said: 'I take full responsibility for employing Andy Coulson. I did so on the basis of undertakings I was given by him about phone hacking and those turned out not to be the case.

'I always said that if they turned out to be wrong, I would make a full and frank apology and I do that today. I am extremely sorry that I employed him. It was the wrong decision and I am very clear about that.'

Mr Osborne said: 'We gave him a second chance but, knowing what we now know, it's clear that we made the wrong decision.'

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'The question for the Prime Minister is: is a partial apology enough or do we have to look into what went wrong?

'There was a guilty verdict yesterday of a man, Mr Coulson, who was already accused of such things when he was brought into Downing Street by the Prime Minister and a decision was made - and this will be put to the Prime Minister today - not to have Mr Coulson properly vetted, as people in his job always have been.'
