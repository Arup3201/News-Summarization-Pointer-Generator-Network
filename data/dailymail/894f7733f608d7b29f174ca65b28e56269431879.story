At the McDonalds restaurant in Needham, Massachusetts, Morris Miller is just as recognizable as Ronald himself.

So when it came to celebrating his 100th birthday on Saturday, the party was always going to be up-sized.

On top of the milestone occasion, there was also another reason for cake - Miller has officially been working at the establishment for a quarter century.

He first started at the ripe old age of 75.

'I did whatever they wanted me to do,' Miller recalled of his first few shifts to CBS.

'His smile and his determination.'

Miller can be seen at the store three days a week.

He comes in for a free breakfast and countless cups of coffee and spends the day talking with customers.
