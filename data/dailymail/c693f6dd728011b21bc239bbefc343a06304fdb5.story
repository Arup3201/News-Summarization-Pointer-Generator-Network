It is almost impossible for westerners to gain access to Iran first-hand, but these pictures aim to take us right inside their private lives.Â 

Iranian photographers have shared what life is like for ordinary young people by taking pictures of a place foreigners would rarely ever see - their living rooms.

Western understandings of Iran tend to be dominated by the aggressive rhetoric of outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmedinijad and controversy over the country's nuclear capabilities.

The outside world is used to seeing pictures of ordinary Iranians covered-up, or in crowd and street scenes, but rarely of them at up-close and at leisure.

The pictures published in a book called Iranian Living Room by 15 local photographers 
give an insight into everyday Iranian life, often on the edge of what is permitted by the Islamic regime.

In Iran Islamic law is strictly enforced, but in their homes many Iranians choose to relax the rules.

In public, men should wear long trousers and long-sleeve shirts, but pictures of them behind closed doors show them in their more western-style clothing, baring their arms and legs.

Cultural strictures are even tighter for women.

In any public place they must cover their heads with a headscarf, wear trousers or a floor length skirt, and a long-sleeved tunic down to their mid-thighs.

Each summer as the heat bears down 
and makes it difficult for women and men to stick to their 
forced Islamic dress code, the religious police go out on to the streets
 to watch out for loose hijabs, inappropriate dress or hairstyles.

In popular culture, women's magazines and many Western CDs and films remain illegal.

DVDs or videos depicting sexual relations are also forbidden.

However, for all the current 
strictures, newly-elected President Hassan Rouhani has signaled that he 
will take a softer line on web censorship and Islamic dress code.

An
 opponent of gender segregation and hardline cultural rules, President 
Rouhani says Iranians' freedoms and rights have been ignored under the rule of eight difficult years under President Ahmadinejad.

His words have been taken as a hint that the Islamic republic could enjoy more freedom over the coming years.

More openness both within the country and in its international relations could not have come at a better time.

Fears over Iran's nuclear capability and Mr Ahmadinejad's militant rhetoric caused many neighbouring countries and western powers to fear the country.

The level of mistrust was in fact demonstrated by this very photography book.

The book, published by Fabrica, was temporarily blacklisted by online payment company PayPal for having the word 'Iranian' in the title.

One of the book's creators Dan Hill complained to PayPal who have since realised that it was not banned under any sanctions.

These young photographers, through their own storytelling, are trying to change the stories we tell about Iran.
