A serial burglar hung his head in shame as one of his victims was allowed to confront him in court.

Great-grandmother Margaret Wallace, 64, forced the man who robbed her to make a grovelling apology as she bravely opted to appear in court to read out her victim impact statement.

Miss Wallace, who was making use of a recent change in the law, told Martin Gilbert, 48, he needed to ‘sort himself out’ ahead of his sentencing for a string of raids on vulnerable victims.

Miss Wallace, who walked to the dock at Newcastle Crown Court with the aid of a walking stick, told the criminal: ‘I just really don’t think you understand how you make people feel.

‘Just get yourself sorted out. Please, please get yourself sorted out.’

During her impassioned speech, the criminal repeatedly said ‘I’m sorry’ as he lowered his reddened face into his hands.

The former hostel worker told the court that she had not slept in her bedroom since her home was broken into and is even afraid to open her windows, despite struggling with asthma.

Looking directly at Gilbert, she said: ‘You’re only 48. You’re a young lad, you don’t need to be doing this. You really don’t. If you don’t mean you are sorry then don’t say it because people don’t want to hear it if you don’t mean it.

‘Please get yourself sorted out – you are upsetting a lot of elderly people and hurting them.

‘I am a compassionate person but to be honest, I could kill you, I really could.’

The court heard that Gilbert had stolen jewellery and other property from Miss Wallace’s home in Walker, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, as she was out celebrating her birthday.

Judge Sean Morris told Gilbert: ‘You have completely ruined her [Miss Wallace’s] comfortable existence in her own home. Targeting elderly people’s homes is a disgrace and it makes you dangerous.’

Gilbert, of Walker, Newcastle, admitted six charges of burglary and was jailed for eight years.

Telling Gilbert that he did not think the criminal would ever change his ways, the judge added: ‘‘It is not just property, it could be potentially life-threatening.’

Gilbert, who had been forcing his way into homes since he was a teenager, was jailed for eight years after admitting six counts of burglary. Speaking after the court hearing yesterday, Miss Wallace said she wanted to speak to the criminal face-to-face after her house was burgled twice in a year.

She said: ‘I sat thinking about it all night on the evening that it happened and I thought if they catch him I want to speak to him. I want to be able to look him in the eye and tell him how he made me feel. I really feel like there has been a weight lifted off my shoulders now.’

Miss Wallace, who lives alone, was told by local police that she was the first victim they had known to read a statement in court. She rebuffed their attempts to dissuade from her doing it. She added: ‘I spoke from my heart. He doesn’t realise the effect he is having on people.’

The court heard that Gilbert had carried out three raids in one day in November last year, including on the home of an 88-year-old Alzheimer’s sufferer.

He also targeted an 85-year-old woman and was caught raiding the presbytery of a church that was home to an 81-year-old vicar.

Miss Dowling said: 'Both were concerned and scared and stayed in the corridor until the police arrived.'

He went on to carry out two further raids in December before he was arrested. 

Jamie Adams, defending, said Gilbert was deeply ashamed and embarrassed of his behaviour, and that he carried out the burglaries while on valium.

A change in the law last year means that criminals can be forced to listen to victims describing the misery caused by crimes. As part of a victims’ code, those affected by crimes now given the right to read out a statement in court.

If the victims choose to, they can read out a statement before sentencing, allowing judges to take into account what they say before setting a jail term. Miss Wallace is one of only a handful of victims who have chosen to appear in person.

Miss Wallace asked Gilbert 'I wonder if you would like it if it happened to your mam?' in the witness box

I am  Margaret Wallace, I am 64 years old. I am living in sheltered accommodation, so I feel safe with living by myself. This is the second time I have been burgled in less than a year.

Since the burglary I have never slept in my bed, I can’t sleep in my bed. I have always slept with the windows open because of my asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].

I can’t sleep with the window closed. I just can’t sleep in the bedroom at all. I daren’t keep the window open, even during the day. I don’t think Mr Gilbert knows the effect he’s had on people.

I just really don’t think you understand how you make people feel. I always thought he was a really nice man. Unfortunately, I don’t think that now. I just wonder if you would like it if it happened to your mam if she lived by herself. I am sure you wouldn’t.

Please, please get yourself sorted out. You’re only 48. You’re a young lad, you don’t need to be doing this. You really don’t. You were in the papers saying you were sorry. Sorry is a word anyone can say, but if you don’t mean it, don’t say it.

People don’t want to hear it if you don’t mean it. Please get yourself sorted out. You are upsetting a lot of elderly people and hurting them.

I am a compassionate person but to be honest I could kill you. I really could. I am sorry, Your Honour. You wouldn’t like it done to your mam and dad.

I am now hoping to move because I just can’t stay there any longer. It has affected me so much, this one.

The first one was bad enough. But for it to have happened again – I don’t even like being in during the day.

I have written to my MP. I feel strongly, if you have done the crime, you should be in court. (Miss Wallace was referring to the fact Gilbert was originally due to be sentenced remotely via video link).

I used to work for [a soup kitchen] in Newcastle for 16 and a half years. I have compassion, I would have done anything for them. I would help anybody but, you know, I always used to say, if I find out you have burgled anyone’s house, God help you.
