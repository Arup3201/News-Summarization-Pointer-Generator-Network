For his 50th birthday, Jim Greenan was probably expecting a slap-up meal or a romantic break.

Instead, all his wife Claire Potter gave him was a wicker box containing 50 brightly coloured pieces of paper.

On each was written a small challenge to be done in order throughout the year.

They ranged from the routine (baking a loaf), to the daring (skinny-dipping) and the bizarre (talking like a pirate, volunteering for a police identity parade).

Taken out of the comfort zone: Jim Greenan with his wife Claire Potter and the box of challenges

Mr Greenan also had to try laughter yoga – a therapy using laughter – and to copy the art of October Jones, who photographs train passengers with cartoon heads superimposed on them.

The tasks were devised to fit in around work, holidays and family life in Oxfordshire with the couple’s 15-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter. 

Miss Potter, a writer, said the idea was to make the year ‘unique and out of the ordinary’. She said: ‘As you get older it can be easy to get in a groove and this has really jolted him out of it.’

So on Mr Greenan’s 50th birthday last January, she presented him with the challenges. 

One of his favourites was photographing ten strangers, asking permission first, on a family holiday to Warsaw. Miss Potter said it gave them an ‘insight into life in Poland’.

Oddly, it was one of the challenges designed to be relaxing and indulgent that caused schoolbook editor Mr Greenan his worst moment – taking a leisurely bath.

Miss Potter said: ‘I ran him a bath but only put the hot water in. I told him to put some cold in but he didn’t hear me and scalded his foot. He then managed to pull the plug out and ended up sitting in a few inches of cold water. He got out and said it was rubbish.’

Mr Greenan said: ‘I do like the idea of challenging myself and I’m thinking about doing something bigger this year.’

Miss Potter said: ‘It has been a really good year seeing him try new things that take him out of his comfort zone.’

When she turned 50 in October, her present was more conventional – a bicycle.

The couple held a joint 50th birthday party in July at which Mr Greenan played a song he had composed as one of his tasks.

He has one challenge left – writing his wife a love letter with 50 things he likes about her. Miss Potter said: ‘I think I deserve that after coming up with all the challenges.’

He was also challenged to go skinny-dipping, left, and buy an item from a charity shop that he wouldn't normally wear, right
