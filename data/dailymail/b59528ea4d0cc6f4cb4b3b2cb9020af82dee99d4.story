'It is something that I will always be proud of. For this I have to thank the club and its president, Florentino Perez, for giving me the chance to defend this badge.

'For an academy player to return to the club of their life is the most amazing thing.

'Thanks to two great managers (Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti) and their respective coaching teams for their confidence, for everything I have learnt from them, for giving me the chance to compete, which is the essence of sport.

'Thanks to all my team-mates, the physios, doctors, groundsmen, and all club employees. It has been a privilege to have shared such moments of great happiness with you, thanks for always treating me with such warmth. I wish you all the best.

'And of course, my sincere thanks to Madrid's fans, this enormous family found all over the world. Thanks for your support and for your strength during this time: you will always be in my heart.

'I leave happy, because I have given my all. My only objective was to work day upon day with respect, dedication and to passionately defend the values of the best club in the world.

'For all this I can say with great pride that every minute I spent with Real Madrid was like a gift sent from the heavens.'

'Hasta el final, vamos Real! From a Madrid fan. Diego Lopez.'
