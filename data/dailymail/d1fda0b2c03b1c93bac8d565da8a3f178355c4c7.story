As many as 1,000 trees were destroyed by the snow storm in Central Park it was revealed as three million homes without electricity were warned the blackout could last for a week.

Park officials said that the unprecedented damage spread across half of the park's 840 acres was the worst they had seen in 27 years after a record 2.9 inches of snow fell on Saturday.

Even though the storm was relatively mild in compared to those in the midst of winter, the massive damage is thought to have been caused by leaves still on the trees keeping snow weighing down on branches.

'It's like a bomb blew off,' Central Park Conservancy president Douglas Blonsky told the New York Times. 'Boom.'

Unprecedented: Central Park received 2.9 inches of snow Saturday, the most ever recorded in the month of October since snowfall records were first kept in 1869

The milder temperatures, which stayed close to freezing, but not well below, meant that the snow was damper and heavier, meaning that it brought extra pressure on the trees.

In the park trees of all ages and sizes were among the nearly 1,000 felled by the early snow storm.

By comparison only 125 trees were destroyed when Tropical Storm Irene passed through in August.

Saturday was only the fourth snowy October day in New York's Central Park since record-keeping began 135 years ago.

Across the road at one of New York's most luxurious hotels, The Plaza, all the trees were destroyed.

City officials reported that they had
 received more than 2,000 calls reporting tree damage by late afternoon 
on Sunday, with about half coming from Staten Island , and a quarter the
 Bronx.

'We've never 
seen a storm like this in October, when the trees are still mostly in 
full leaf,' Adrian Benepe, commissioner of the city's parks department 
told the New York Times.

'I've never seen such widespread damage.'

On Sunday night, an advisory to be cautious when entering Central Park remained in effect.

'Heavy wet snow and strong winds, combined with full leaves on trees has damaged trees in the Park, creating an elevated and ongoing danger of falling branches and trees,' park users were told.

'Conservancy crews are working to address the damage, and Central Park is open, but some dangerous conditions may persist.'

The number of homes and businesses without power on the East Coast has grown to more than 3 million.

From Maryland to Maine, officials said it would take days to restore electricity, even though the snow ended on Sunday.

The storm smashed record snowfall totals for October and worsened as it moved north.

Communities in western Massachusetts 
were among the hardest hit. Snowfall totals topped 27 inches in 
Plainfield, and nearby Windsor had gotten 26 inches by early Sunday.

It was blamed for at least 11 deaths,
 and states of emergency were declared in New Jersey, Connecticut, 
Massachusetts and parts of New York.

More
 than 800,000 power customers were without electricity in Connecticut 
alone â€” shattering the record set just two months ago by Hurricane 
Irene. Massachusetts had more than 600,000 outages, and so did New 
Jersey - including Gov. Chris Christie's house.

Parts of Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, New York, Maine, Maryland and Vermont also were without power.

'It's going to be a more difficult 
situation than we experienced in Irene,' Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. 
Malloy said. 'We are expecting extensive and long-term power outages.'

Thirty-two shelters were open around 
the state, and Malloy asked volunteer fire departments to allow people 
in for warmth and showers. At least four hospitals were relying on 
generators for power.

Around Newtown in western 
Connecticut, trees were so laden with snow on some back roads that the 
branches touched the street. Every few minutes, a snap filled the air as
 one broke and tumbled down. Roads that were plowed became impassible 
because the trees were falling so fast.

Many of the areas hit by the storm had also been hit by Irene.

Vaccaro, the weather service spokesman, said the snowstorm 'absolutely crushed previous records that in some cases dated back more than 100 years.'

There usually isn't enough cold air 
in the region to support a nor'easter this time of year, but an area of 
high pressure over southeastern Canada funneled cold air south into the 
U.S., Vaccaro said.

That cold air combined with moisture coming from the North Carolina coast to produce the unseasonable weather.

A few businesses enjoyed the early snow - ski resorts in Vermont and Maine opened early. But it was more commonly an aggravation.

Many residents were urged to avoid travel altogether. Speed limits were reduced on bridges between New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

A few roads closed because of accidents and downed trees and power lines, said Sean Brown, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.

Five people died in Pennsylvania because of the storm, two each in car accidents in suburban Philadelphia.

An 84-year-old Temple man was killed Saturday when a snow-laden tree fell on his home while he was napping in his recliner.

Storm-related traffic accidents also killed people in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island.

A New Jersey man died Saturday in a house fire sparked by a downed power line, and a man in Springfield, Mass., was electrocuted by downed wires.
