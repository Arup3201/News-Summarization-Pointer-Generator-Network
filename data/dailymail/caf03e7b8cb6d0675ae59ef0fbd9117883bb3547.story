Police were called to a £10 sale at a disused shopping mall amid chaotic scenes as people tried to rip fixtures and fittings from the wall.

Everything inside the Corn Exchange, formerly the Triangle, in Manchester, was being offered for as little as £10 before it is redeveloped with the proceeds going to charity Forever Manchester.

Some People queued for more than 11 hours in a bid to be in pole position to grab a bargain at the sale, billed as 'first come first served'.

Desperate consumers clambered up the walls to remove the centre's lights and CCTV cameras 

People carried home anything that wasn't nailed or bolted securely to the floor during the sale 

People queued for 11 hours outside the shopping centre in Manchester in a bid to bag a bargain 

However there chaotic scenes as the shutters opened at 9am.

People began ripping televisions and speakers from the walls as rows erupted over other items.

Organisers decided shut the event down after less than an hour with police called in to remove everyone from the building.

Bosses at Aviva Investors, who own The Triangle, or Corn Exchange, decided to sell as much as possible from the building before it is redeveloped.

But the event was shut down after less than an hour after organisers called in the police to clear the area 

Several flat-screen televisions were unscrewed from the wall and carried off by bargain hunters 

These gentlemen were able to take home a small dining room table and a set of high-backed chairs 

The aim is for the historic grade II building to be re-launched next Spring as a base for 13 independent restaurants and a hotel.

Before the sale associate director Simon Green said: 'We were astounded at what had been left behind [in the Corn Exchange] and wanted to do something with the items ahead of the scheme being stripped back prior to redevelopment.

'We've always been supporters of Forever Manchester and hope this sale will raise funds for good local causes.'

Bargain hunters bought every conceivable item from the store for prices as low as £10

The special event was organised in advance of the shopping centre's redevelopment
