Hundreds of British tourists are being flown home from Kenya by their travel operators after the Foreign Office warned of terror threats.

As many as 400 Britons travelling with Thomson and First Choice are thought to be affected by the change in official safety advice over visiting the country.

The holiday companies said they were cancelling flights to Mombasa – Kenya’s second largest city – until at least the end of October.

According to reports they have about 400 customers in the country who have been told to pack up mid-holiday and travel back to the airport in an organised convoy under armed guard.

Last night, a source at a Thompson beach resort in Kenya confirmed that British tourists were preparing to leave the complex yesterday and will be flying home today.

The Foreign Office has warned against all non-essential travel to Mombasa Island, on which part of the city of Mombasa lies.

Holidaymakers are also being advised to avoid the surrounding area, but not including the tourist areas of Diani or Moi international airport which serves the city.

Tourists said British travellers booked with other companies were not being evacuated.

The Foreign Office advice reads: ‘There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. The main threat comes from extremists linked to Al Shabaab, a militant group that has carried out attacks in response to Kenya’s military intervention in Somalia.

‘There has been a spate of small-scale grenade, bomb and armed attacks in Nairobi (especially the area of Eastleigh), Mombasa, and North Eastern Province.

Earlier this month, a bombing at a bus shelter in Mombasa killed three people and injured a further 16

‘You should take care in public places where people gather, and exercise a heightened level of vigilance.’

Andy Coughlan, a musician from Swansea, was on a luxury holiday with his wife Irena, 53, to celebrate news that her breast cancer had gone into remission.

The couple, who arrived on Tuesday morning, said they were disappointed and don’t understand why their dream holiday has been cut short.

Although their hotel is outside the new alert zone, they are being evacuated. ‘We’re absolutely devastated,’ Mr Coughlan told the Daily Telegraph. ‘Ren had been seriously ill for a long time and this was the first time after all the chemo that she was ready to travel.

‘She said she wanted to wait for her hair to grow back. As soon as it did, we were on our way here. Now we have to turn around and go back again, and it seems for absolutely crazy reasons.’

It is thought that al Qaeda-linked Somali group al Shabaab was behind the attack

Mrs Coughlan said: ‘We were supposed to be going on safari today, but instead we’re being told to pack and go back to England.

‘I can’t believe it’s happening. I’ve been looking forward to this holiday for such a long time.’

In the last few days the Kenyan government has pledged to step up security for tourists following a number of terrorist-related incidents.

The Foreign Office said they estimated that around 5,500 Britons currently in the area would be affected and no one else should travel to the area until further notice.

In its advisory, the Foreign Office said: ‘We advise against all but essential travel to Mombasa Island and within 5km of the coast from Mtwapa creek in the north to Tiwi in the south. If you are currently in an area to which we now advise against all but essential travel, you should consider whether you have an essential reason to remain. If not, you should leave the area.’
