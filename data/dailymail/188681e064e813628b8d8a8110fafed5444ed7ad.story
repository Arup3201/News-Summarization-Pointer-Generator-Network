'Accident': Paul Pagnall, 18, who was found hanged at home this week

A mother has told of how she found her gifted, 18-year-old son hanged at home in an 'accident' she first mistook for a joke.

The body of Paul Bagnall, a student at Darrick Wood school in Orpington, Kent, was discovered by his mother Sandrine, 44, on Tuesday.

Mr Bagnall was a prefect at his sixth-form, spoke fluent French, played rugby for his school's first team, and had been offered a place to study mechanical engineering in Southampton.

His family said that he had no history of bullying, and had been looking forward to a skiing holiday at half-term.

His mother said: 'At first I thought it was a terrible joke. Then I realised there had been an accident.

'He had no problems, lots of friends and was looking forward to going to university. He was the sweetest, nicest boy.'

His
 father, Nick, 57, a banker, said: 'He was a great boy and much loved by
 everyone who knew him. He was a great son and brother to his sister - a
 wonderful boy who did not have a bad bone in his body.

'His teachers said he was a natural mathematician and used to help his friends out with their work.

'Despite being a bit clumsy, through determination he became a good rugby player and a black belt in karate.

'He
 was always smiling. Even when he was in a karate bout he would be 
beaming that's the kind of person he was. He will be missed by so many 
people.'

A spokesman for London Ambulance Service said they were called at just before 4pm on Tuesday, and pronounced Mr Bagnall dead at the scene.

She said: 'We sent London's Air Ambulance, an ambulance crew, two single responders in cars and a duty officer to the scene.

'Extensive efforts were made to resuscitate a man who was in cardiac arrest. Sadly, he was pronounced dead at the scene by the doctor from the air ambulance.'

A police spokesman said Paul's death was not being treated as suspicious.

The principal of his school also paid tribute to the 'very able' student, who was also a karate black belt and on track to receive a Duke of Eidinburgh gold award.

Barbara Rhymaun described Mr Bagnall as: 'an exceptional student who was very popular amongst staff and students alike'.

She said: 'He was a very able student on target to achieve A star grades at A level. He was a naturally gifted mathematician and physicist with university offers to study engineering.

'He was fully committed to every aspect of school life, playing rugby for the 1st XV and was a valued school prefect.

'Paul
 also participated in the Duke of Edinburgh Scheme and was set to 
complete his gold award. He also enjoyed skiing and had achieved a black
 belt in karate.'

'I am sure you can imagine that Paul's parents and all members of his family are very upset at this tragic turn of events.

'I
 know that the thoughts and prayers of everyone at Darrick Wood School 
are with them at this difficult time. We shall miss him greatly.'

Friends and team-mates also posted messages of remembrance. Writing on Twitter, Danny Carter said: 'RIP Paul Bagnall, it was an honour to call you teammate and a friend. You never took a step back on the pitch, truly a great lad!'

Seb Kirk wrote: 'Such terrible news but couldn't have asked to have known a better lad, the nicest boy you'll ever meet.'

Amy Francis added: 'The world has truly lost a treasure, cannot believe you've left us so suddenly RIP Paul.'
