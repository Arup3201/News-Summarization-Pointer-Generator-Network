Pop star Madonna has come under fire for posting a tasteless photograph of two topless dancers bearing Middle East ‘peace’ signs on Instagram.

The veteran singer, 55, was criticised by fans after posting the picture of herself flanked by dancers bearing the Star of David and the Muslim star and crescent.

Accompany the picture, she wrote: ‘No Separation! We all bleed the same color! #ceasefire #peaceinthemiddleeast #livingforlove.’

Pro-Palestine and pro-Israel supporters exchanged a war of words on Madonna's Instagram page after she posted this photograph of herself with topless dancers bearing the Star of David and Muslim star and crescent

Fans immediately responded to the picture, sparking a war of words between pro-Palestine and pro-Israel followers.

One user, aichaam, responded: ‘F**kk Israel. Israel is a f***n place they’re killing a childrens (sic) and her parents.’

Another follower, ranrubherre, said: ‘Supporting Israel is supporting the war against terror and extreme Islam that wants to take away our freedom.’

Meanwhile, Bathen_burak wrote: ‘And what about the Israeli children??? Stop hamas not Israel from kill (sic) children!!!’

However, one fan -  who wrote under the name tukrp - appeared to support the image and said: 'Definitely what we need, people with that much fame doing this @beautifully_awakened.'

It comes just 24 hours after Madonna posted another photo in relation to the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

On Thursday she uploaded a picture of a dove flying alongside Hebrew and Arabic text, with the caption: ‘Cease fire on both sides! The children of Gaza need our support! #ceasefire #peaceinthemiddleeast #livingforlove’

It came less than 24 hours after she uploaded this picture of a dove flying alongside Hebrew and Arabic text

Last week, Madonna clarified her political stance and said: 'I do not support Hamas! I support human dignity'

The latest posts cane after a string of other messages posted by the star in relation to the conflict in Gaza.

She has posted several messages to her Instagram page since the fighting began on July 8, including a few of flowers in bloom and another stating: ‘Make love not war.’

Last week she was forced to clarify her political stance, after coming under fire from fans who misconstrued her posts as support for Hamas.

Alongside a photograph of herself pouting, she wrote: ‘I do not support Hamas! I support human dignity and respect! I support sharing! I support Peace! #ceasefire.’
