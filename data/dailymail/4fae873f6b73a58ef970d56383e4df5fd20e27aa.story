David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband will be put on the spot this week when broadcasting chiefs announce fresh details of planned televised Election debates.

BBC, ITV and a combined Sky/Channel 4 team will draw lots to decide the scheduling order for three proposed TV confrontations between the party leaders.

They intend to show three debates in the six weeks leading up to the May 7 Election, with two programmes featuring seven party leaders and a separate head-to-head clash between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband.

But there is continuing speculation that the debates may never be screened because of squabbling between the rival parties and the broadcasters.

The Prime Minister has complained that the debates are too close to polling day, Mr Clegg says it is unfair to exclude him from the Cameron versus Miliband showdown and Mr Miliband is worried that allowing Scottish Nationalist Party leader Nicola Sturgeon to take part in two of the debates is a major threat to Labour’s fading hopes north of the border.

Veteran political inquisitor Jeremy Paxman has been tipped to host one of the programmes

Some Tory MPs have urged Mr Cameron to boycott the debates altogether on the grounds that with a superior personal rating in the polls to Mr Clegg or Mr Miliband, he has most to lose by debating with them live on television over three hours or more.

Channel 4 and Sky TV, which have won the right to broadcast the Cameron versus Miliband clash, are reportedly planning to ‘empty chair’ the debate if the Prime Minister refuses to take part. 

That could make it tricky for Mr Miliband if he opts to appear on his own as he would face the prospect of being interrogated by new Channel 4 recruit, veteran political inquisitor Jeremy Paxman, who has been tipped to host the programme.

Invitations to join the two debates of seven leaders will be sent to Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg, Mrs Sturgeon, Ukip’s Nigel Farage, Green party leader Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.

Northern Ireland’s Protestant-dominated Democratic Unionist Party has threatened legal action for being excluded. 

And if they win, it is certain to provoke similar demands from rival parties in Ulster.

Broadcasters want to hold the debates on April 2, April 16 and April 30.
