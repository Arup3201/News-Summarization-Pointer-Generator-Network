He is Britain’s most brutal inmate with a 40-year history of prison violence.

But Charles Bronson was talked down by a petite female officer after he took a governor hostage, The Mail on Sunday can reveal as a 'sinister' painting he sent Reggie Kray is put up for auction.

The 20-something guard negotiated with the notorious prisoner to bring the tense, 20-minute stand-off to a peaceable end.

The attack at HMP Woodhill, Milton Keynes, on February 28 saw Bronson moved 150 miles into isolation at HMP Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

The 5ft officer persuaded Bronson to release his grip on the governor’s throat, before two guards seized the 61-year-old.

‘Bronson got hold of the duty governor’s neck in a dispute over his mail,’ said a source. ‘It was not looking good.’

Bronson
 was jailed for seven years for armed robbery in 1974, but has spent 40 
years behind bars for a series of violent episodes in prison.

He got a life sentence in 1999 for taking a teacher hostage and leashing him ‘like a dog’ for two days.

This latest incident is being looked  into and could lead to Bronson serving yet more time.

The story comes as it was reported the belongings of notorious criminals Reggie and Ronnie Kray will go up for auction next week.

Items
 going under the hammer will include a well-thumbed bible and wristwatch
 - both owned by the twins when they were serving life-sentences for 
murder.

Ronnie Kray was also convicted of murdering George Cornell in 1966 - he shot Cornell between the eyes at an East End pub.

The bible and black Quartz watch were originally owned by Ronnie but passed on to his brother Reggie after his death in 1995.

According to 
paperwork, the items were all given away by Reggie to an acquaintance in 1999 while he was 
serving time at HM Prison Wayland in Norfolk.

In his bible, Ronnie had marked up specific passages 'on judgement and damnation'.

In the same lot, is another of the twins' belongings, a painting by one of Britain's most well-known prisoners, Charles Bronson.

The auctioneer selling the pieces, Jonathan Humbert from auction house JP Humbert's in Northamptonshire, described the painting as 'altogether more sinister'.

Bronson, whose real name is Michael 
Peterson, is currently serving a life term at HMP Woodhill in Milton 
Keynes and has earned public notoriety with a history of violence both 
inside and outside jail.

With the painting, he included a note which read: 'To Reg, from your friend Charles Bronson'.

Both Bronson and Reggie were in prison at the time. Bronson was jailed at Wakefield prison and Reggie in Norfolk.

Charles Bronson sent this note to his 'friend' Reggie Kray in prison

A quartz, black-strapped wristwatch belonging to Ronnie Kray while he was in jail serving a life sentence was passed to his twin brother Reggie.
Reggie gave the watch to an acquaintance in 1999, according to the accompanying prison documentation

The bible and watch were originally owned by Ronnie Kray but passed on to brother Reggie after Ronnie died in jail in 1995. In the bible owned by Ronnie, specific passages 'on judgement and damnation' were marked up

The seller of the items has remained anonymous but JP Humbert's said that they expect the pieces to fetch hundreds of thousands.

Jonathan Humbert, from the auction 
house in Towcester, said that the Kings James version Bible, which had belonged to Ronnie, had been organised with three original bookmarks.

The marks pick out 'chapters on judgement and damnation', Mr Humbert said.

He added: 'For example, the first bookmark is in Psalms 26, where it reads 'Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine integrity.

'It goes on: 'examine me, O Lord, and prove me.

'We have not touched them, and we are assured the markers have not been moved by the vendor either.'

Reggie Kray, requested for his painting, by Charles Bronson, to be given to an acquaintance. Pictured is the note from Reggie to prison officers

The auctioneer said that he thought the bible would be popular with buyers.

He said: 'So you have on one hand an infamous criminal who thought nothing of using violence to mete out his own punishments, but who here has a copy of the Bible and has apparently picked out these passages on judgement and damnation.

'It is in some ways the opposite of what you might expect these guys to have in their possession.'

The paperwork accompanying the lots will also go to the winning bidders.

Ronald and Reginald Kray, together with older brother Charlie, were infamous for their involvement running organised crime rackets in London's East End.

During their prison terms, Ronnie was held at Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire, while Reggie was held at jails including the high security HMP Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight.

Ronnie died of a heart attack in prison in 1995, while Reggie died of terminal cancer eight weeks after he was granted release on compassionate grounds because of his illness.

Mr Humbert said: 'Because we have the prison transfer paperwork from when Reggie gave these items away, the provenance is absolute.

'We're expecting a lot of interest because of the brothers' notoriety.'

The lots will go under the hammer at JP Humbert's in Towcester, Northamptonshire from 5pm on March 19.
