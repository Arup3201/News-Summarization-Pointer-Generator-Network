Manchester City came from a goal down to secure a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

Loic Remy opened the scoring for the Blues, before David Silva levelled for City just after half-time.

Here, Sportsmail's Matt Barlow rates each player from the top-of-the-table clash in the Premier League.

Chelsea

Thibaut Courtois: Confident saves from Jesus Navas and Sergio Aguero but missed his clearance punch on cross which led to Silva’s equaliser. 5.5

Branislav Ivanovic: Sometimes too eager to burst forward and attack. Made a couple of slips in possession early in game. 6

Kurt Zouma: Preferred again to Gary Cahill and excelled. Quick, powerful in the air and aware with one very good tackle on Aguero. 7.5

John Terry: Got away with a rare slip which let in Aguero on goal in the first-half. Otherswise solid.7

Cesar Azpilicueta: Good block denied Fernando early on but struggled to contain pace of Navas at times. 5.5

Ramires: In for Cesc Fabregas. Unable to match his creativity but mobile and industrious, winning and circulating the ball. 6.5

Nemanja Matic: Strength important in early phase. Covered ground, broke up play and made vital recovery tackles. 7.5

Eden Hazard: Bright first-half delivered a wonderful cross for Loic Remy’s goal, eased across goal on the volley. Faded. 7

Willian: Quiet. Not his usual high-energy contribution, before limped off with 10 minutes from time. 5

Oscar: Also quiet. Unable to exert his creative influence on the game in the right areas of the pitch. 5.5

Loic Remy: Starting only second Premier League game for Chelsea and opened the scoring with a simple finish after good movement. 6.5

Substitutes: Didier Drogba on for Willian 80, Gary Cahill for Remy 87, Ruben Loftus-Cheek for Oscar 90+2.

MANAGER: Jose Mourinho: Decision to start with Remy was rewarded. Sent on Cahill to protect the point. Yet more ranting on the touchline. 6

Manchester City

Joe Hart: Not especially busy. Thirty minutes before his first real save, from Oscar, little chance with the goal and virtually redundant second half. 6

Bacary Sagna: Preferred to Pablo Zabaleta, he found it difficult against Hazard in the first-half, but linked well with Navas in attack.6.5

Vincent Kompany: Started strong - slip lets in Remy who set up Oscar – loses Remy for the goal – tries to read the cross and cut it out but can’t reach. 6

Martin Demichelis: The more solid of City’s central defenders. Read it well. Escaped a handball appeal first-half. 7

Gael Clichy: Good job of containing Willian and the overlapping threat of Ivanovic. Chose well moments to get forward. 7

Fernando: Won his share of tackles and competed in a physical midfield area. Booked. Subbed. 6

Fernandinho: Also strong in midfield and supplied the ball well to the three attacking midfielders. 7

Jesus Navas: Subdued early on but exploded into life after providing cross Silva’s equaliser. Excellent second half. 8

David Silva: Fabulous vision and appreciation and increasingly influential in game. First goal in six games. Booked. 7.5

James Milner: Selfless performance to neutralise the attacking threat of Ivanovic and assist Clichy, before tucking inside. 6.5

Sergio Aguero: Missed a terrific chance when game goalless. Sweet strike left-foot makes goal for Silva. Subbed. 6.5

Substitutes: Frank Lampard on for Fernando 76; Edin Dzeko for Aguero 83, Stevan Jovetic for Silva 89. 

MANAGER: Manuel Pellegrini: The onus was on his team to make the game but they were slow to hit their stride. Will feel they should have won and may not have risked enough in pursuit of the win? 6
