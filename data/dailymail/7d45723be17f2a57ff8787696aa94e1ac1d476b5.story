Marianne Faithfull has revealed her drug-dealing ex-boyfriend 'killed' legendary rockstar Jim Morrison by giving him heroin which was too strong.

Mystery has long surrounded the death of The Doors lead singer after he suddenly collapsed and died in his Paris apartment in 1971.

More than 40 years on, singer Faithfull has claimed that her then-partner - a drug dealer called Jean de Breteuil - supplied Morrison with drugs which  led to an overdose.

In an interview with MOJO magazine, she said of de Breteuil: 'He went to see Jim Morrison and killed him.

Faithfull was 24 at the time of Morrison's death and says she had travelled to Paris with her then-boyfriend, Jean de Breteuil, who visited Morrison's flat and supplied him with drugs

'I mean I’m sure it was an accident. Poor B******d. The smack was too strong? Yeah, and he died.

'I didn’t know anything about this. Anyway, everybody connected to the death of this poor guy is dead now, except me.'

Morrison was found dead in the bathtub of a rented flat on Rue Beautreillis in the Marais district of Paris aged just 27.

An autopsy was never carried out on his body and the official French death certificate solely states he died of 'natural causes'. 

Faithfull, who was 24 at the time and was battling her own drug problems, said she had stayed away from the flat where Morrison lived and had taken some 'downers'.

She added: 'I could intuitively feel trouble. I thought, I’ll take a few Tuinal and I won’t be there.' 

De Bruteuil himself died of an overdose later the same year in Morocco.

Morrison had just finished recording what was to become The Door's most popular album, LA Woman, when he first arrived in the French capital in March 1971.

He lived a notoriously wild life, abusing both alcohol and drugs, and soon became a regular at the Rock 'n' Roll Circus, a club frequented by the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix.

In 2007, French-born former New York Times journalist Sam Bernett claimed Morrison died of a massive heroin overdose in the toilet of a nightclub he was managing, the Rock 'n' Roll Circus on the French capital's Left Bank.

Bernett claimed the death was then covered up by two drug dealers who transferred Morrison's body from the club to the singer's apartment and dumped it in the bath.

Ms Faithfull said De Breteuil told her he had to pay a visit to Morrison's apartment, but she chose to stay in her own hotel room taking 'downers'.

'I could intuitively feel trouble,' she said. 'I thought, I'll take a few Tuinal and I won't be there. And he went to see Jim Morrison and killed him.

'I mean I'm sure it was an accident. Poor b*****d. The smack was too strong? Yeah. And he died. And I didn't know anything about this.

'Anyway, everybody connected to the death of this poor guy is dead now. Except me.'

Morrison was found on July 3 by his then girlfriend, Pamela Courson, who was played by Meg Ryan in the 1991 biopic about the incident called, The Doors. Val Kilmer played Morrison.

Courson died of a heroin overdose in her apartment three years later, also aged 27, while Breteuil died of an overdose in 1971.

Ms Faithfull, best known for her hit As Time Goes By, also spoke of singer Amy Winehouse, who also died aged 27, saying she was 'appalled' at the circumstances.

'Amy was very, very wary of me,' said Ms Faithfull. 'She knew that I knew and she didn't want me to say anything.

'There's a level of narcissism which is all mixed up with self-hatred. I know it well. It's like a glass wall between you and the world, so that all the love that everybody pours onto you, you don't feel it.'

Ms Faithfull also co-wrote the song Sister Morphine, which is about heroin, with Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards.

Twenty seven is a common age for rock stars who die young, with Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain, guitarist Jimi Hendrix, singer Janis Joplin and Rolling Stones founder Brian Jones all dying at the same age.

Morrison is buried in Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris – still a site of pilgrimage for thousands of music fans from all over the world, including many from the singer’s native America.

Faithfull, now 67, still lives in Paris, and has a new album, Give My Love To London, out in September.
