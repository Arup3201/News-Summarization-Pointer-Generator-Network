In a galaxy not so far away, a French inventor has created a replica of Han Solo’s famous spaceship, the Millennium Falcon.

The amazing contraption is seen hovering and flying around the ground, complete with the aesthetics and lights inspired by the famous Star Wars ship. 

It is built around a standard quadcopter drone, which has been boosted to give the Millennium Falcon drone more speed.

A French inventor has unveiled a Star Wars-inspired quadcopter (shown). The Millennium Falcon drone is seen taking off and flying around. It has lights on the back to mimic famous spaceship. And it also has a shell and design that matches the original. The drone itself cost about £750, but the modifications were under £20

Olivier Caron, 40, who goes by Olivier-FR on Reddit and is from Grenoble in France, said that he ‘overpowered’ the quadcopter drone to make it ‘easily capable of 90 km/h (55mph) speed’.

Rumours suggest that the California-based firm is looking to release a range of multirotor helicopters late in 2015.

The devices would be fitted with GoPro cameras, controlled remotely and are expected to retail for between $500 (£317) and $1,000 (£634).

At this price range, the drones would be targeted more towards consumers and hobbyists and compete with market leaders Parrot and DJI, rather than rival the likes of professional devices from senseFly. 

He added: ‘But with this extra hull it becomes a slow flying pig.

‘Top speed is probably around 30 km/h (19mph), if I try to go faster with more angle it’s making a cool backflip.’

He joked that it could make the ‘Kessel run’ in several thousand years, in reference to Han Solo’s boasting in Star Wars: A New Hope, when he said the Millennium Falcon could make the ‘Kessel run’ - a smuggling route - in ‘less than twelve parsecs’.

Olivier said it cost him next to nothing to modify the drone into a new shape.

It cost £7.50 ($11.50) for the two foam planks to make the drone, and £9 ($13.80) for the front and rear lights.

Of course, the quadcopter itself and the radio set him back about £750 ($1,150), though

He used acrylic paint for the body of the spacecraft, and glue to hold it all together.

He used a drone known as the Prophecy 335, with a custom frame made of carbon and aluminium.

The battery usually lasts about eight minutes, but with the added weight of the Millenium Falcon shell it lasted only about five minutes.

Next up, Olivier said he was planning to work on a drone version of a Tie Fighter.

Mr Caron also showed off his creation above a snowy field in Grenoble (pictured), at the foot of the french Alps, making it look somewhat like 'Hoth' from Star Wars

The video shows the replica Millennium Falcon drone zipping around the field at a height of around 20 feet and the rear of the ship is light up just as it is in the films

Mr Caron built the Falcon using different parts bought from various manufacture as well as parts he made by hand. But, aside from the drone, he built the entire thing from scratch
