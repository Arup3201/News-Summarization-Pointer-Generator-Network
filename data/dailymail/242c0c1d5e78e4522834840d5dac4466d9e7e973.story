Pictures of a terrified teenager being forced to strip naked before being punched and kicked by her classmates have shocked China.

The 16-year-old girl can be seen cowering naked in the corner as the group - which is said to have included some of her supposed friends - carry out the vicious onslaught.

It is thought she started off wearing a green T-shirt, but as the gang became more frenzied they ripped her clothes from her body in the dormitory of Bancang Middle School, in Bancang township in Funing county in south-western China's Yunnan province.

Aggressive: The six-strong group beat the girl after tearing off her clothes in the school dormitory

Clothed: It appears the girl was fully dressed in jeans and a green T-shirt when the attack began

The six-strong group of girls then punch and kick the teenager, before covering her with toothpaste and hacking off her hair, the People's Daily reported.

As a final insult, the group then appears to pose with the traumatised teen, who covers her face.

And it seems the girls were so proud of their disgusting actions, that they posted the images to China's second biggest social networking site QQ to boast.

The apparent ringleader posted the photographs boasting about how she and her pals who are not students at the school had 'Ripped the s**t out of this slut'.

Police have identified her as Lu Tung, 16, who went on the run after outraged web users came across the horrifying pictures.

Sickening: Later, they posed with the devastated teenager - and then posted the pictures on social media

Torture: The gang - who are now thought to be on the run - also chopped off the girl's hair

Proud: Alleged ringleader Lu Tung boasted on social media they had 'ripped the s***' out of the girl

Lu Tung is now thought to have fled along with the other girls to the crowded city of Guangzhou, in southern China's Guangdong province, which is 850 miles away.

A police spokesman said: 'This was a particularly nasty and vicious assault and we have yet to establish the motive behind it.

'We are now searching for the girls and for Lu Tang who appears to have been the ring leader.'

A school spokesman said: 'This is absolutely abhorrent and we will get to the bottom of it and demand punishment for the girls involved.'

The victim is now being looked after by her parents and receiving counselling.
