A spectator ran on to the pitch and hit Franck Ribery with a scarf in stoppage time of Bayern Munich's 3-1 victory at Hamburg in the second round of the German Cup on Wednesday.

The man ran the width of the field before hitting the former France forward, who had secured victory for the cup holders. The intruder was caught by guards and escorted from the pitch.

'Fortunately, nothing much happened,' a relaxed and smiling Ribery told German television after the match. 'It was a difficult situation, I didn't see him coming.'

Ribery had been booed by Hamburg fans every time he touched the ball.

Bayern took advantage of a dreadful Hamburg mistake and a poor refereeing decision to take a two-goal lead through Robert Lewandowski and David Alaba before Ribery scored with a deflected shot in the second half.

Pierre-Michel Lasogga scored a late consolation for the hosts.  

For Bayern's first, Thomas Muller anticipated a horrible back pass from Heiko Westermann, picked up the ball and fed Lewandowski, whose first effort was cleared off the line by Johan Djourou. But the ball fell for the Poland striker, who drilled it inside the post in the seventh minute.

Muller netted himself later but had the strike disallowed for offside before Alaba doubled the lead shortly before halftime.

Bayern were given a throw-in although the ball had bounced off Philipp Lahm. With Hamburg's players still out of position, Xabi Alonso got the ball from the throw-in and fed Alaba, who fired home from nearly 30 meters (yards).

Hamburg goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny got his hands on the shot but couldn't keep it out, and Bayern had a comfortable lead despite creating few chances.

Ribery's shot from the edge of the box in the 55th minute deflected off Djourou, wrong-footing Drobny, and put the match beyond doubt. The keeper made a pair of late saves to keep the score respectable before Lasogga's token effort.

'Our goal is to stay in this competition until the end,' said Bayern captain Lahm, whose team face Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga at the weekend.
