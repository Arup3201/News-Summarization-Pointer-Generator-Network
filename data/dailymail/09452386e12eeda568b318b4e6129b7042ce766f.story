Rita Ora has proven that she is seriously persuasive when it comes to perfume.

The 23-year-old singer became the face of DKNY's latest scent MYNY earlier this year and since then the brand has seen sales rocket.

Rita has given the Donna Karan fashion house the sweet smell of success with an astronomical 249 per cent uplift on perfume sales.

Despite having only unveiled Rita as their perfume ambassador this summer the American fashion label has seen sales of the perfume increase with the UK selling three-and-a-half times more than August the previous year. 

The 23-year-old singer who lives in west London, shot the campaign for the fragrance in Times Square this summer and after only a month on sale the perfume is now expected to sell over 250,000 units by Christmas with the campaign anticipated to be the most successful of DKNY fragrances yet.

Since becoming the face of DKNY's fragrance Rita Ora has helped to boost sales by 249 per cent 

Rita Ora has been an ambassador for DKNY for some time but she has proven she is perfect for the role as it has been rumoured that she has signed a three-year deal with the fashion house this summer for £2.5m.

Donna Karen, the woman behind the New York label, praised Rita's performance and says she can think of no one else more suited to the brand. 

'If Rita can't sell it, I don't know who can' said the 66-year-old designer. 

'I think Rita's a great representative of DKNY. She's full of life, she's about what everyone wants to feel - energy. And I find her ageless. She's like this Energizer Bunny who can wear anything from track shoes to stilettos, DKNY to Donna Karan. I love the girl as a person, too. She walks the talk.'

The money-spinning singer is equally fond of Donna expressing her admiration for the designer.  

'Donna's a very powerful and confident woman. She comes across as very strong, and that's what I love about her line. 

'It's a very confident, energetic line and it's about women who speak their minds. The fragrance celebrates New York City, which is unlike anywhere else in the world. I love the idea of being part of a campaign that captures the spirit of New York and the stories of women here, passionate about their dreams.'  

Rita expressed her strong admiration of the 66-year-old designer and says that she loves the brand 

The perfume itself is housed in a heart-shaped bottle with a skyline-inspired cap, and the scent has top notes of raspberries, galbanum and pink pepper, a heart of Egyptian jasmine, freesia and orris root, and a drydown of patchouli, vanilla absolute, musk and ambergris. 

Leading online beauty retailer Rakesh Aggarwal of Escentual.com who stock the fragrance says that he is not surprised to see such an augmentation in sales.

'There has been an unprecedented rise in sales of DKNY fragrance in the past couple of months. This can only be put down to the huge appeal and publicity surrounding the new fragrance with Rita Ora.

'There has been a huge sales uplift of 249% year on year against the same period last year on nearly all of their fragrance lines that we stock but the sales figures for the MYNY fragrance are nothing short of spectacular and it's looking set to be one of the top selling perfumes of 2015.' 

From the Pope to reality TV star Joey Essex, it seems that most public figures have them.

But earlier this year celebrity scents suffered somewhat of a slump with beauty giant Elizabeth Arden seeing a 28 per cent revenue drop because of a decline in their sales.

Furthermore, the company said the drop in sales, which triggered a 25 per cent fall in share price, was largely due to the fragrances of pop stars Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift.

The cosmetic firm said its quarterly pre-tax loss to the end of June was £48m – the worst in the company’s 104 year history. 

Each year, more than 500 celebrity perfumes are released into an already highly saturated market, which began with the launch of Elizabeth Taylor’s White Diamonds for Elizabeth Arden in 1991 and went on to sell 60million bottles.

Sales were at the highest in 2011, when Bieber’s Someday was the biggest selling perfume in America – with one bottle sold every minute in the first week of its launch. 

Elizabeth Arden, which had to cut 175 jobs because of the slump, said at the time that half the loss was due to such products, adding in a statement: ‘The decline in sales of celebrity fragrances, particularly the Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift fragrances, was steeper than anticipated.’

However just a few months after this dramatic drop in sales was reported the celebrity perfume industry saw a helpful boost with the launch of TOWIE star, Sam Faier’s fragrance Bella.

Record numbers of the Eau de Parfum flew off the shelves, also placing it in the top three biggest selling scents across all ranges after its launch in June.

Sam's newcomer overtook Alesha Dixon's Rose Quartz, which fell into second place, while One Direction's That Moment and Britney Spears' Fantasy took third and fourth respectively.

Meanwhile The Fragrance Shop spokesperson Daniel Thompson contradicted the news of dropping sales and said that the company had seen a dramatic increase in sales.

'2014 is proving to be a hot year for celebrity fragrances. We're seeing a surge in sales as customers want something new from their fashion and music icons.’
