Another arctic blast is on its way for residents in the Midwest and East Coast still reeling from last week's brutal polar vortex -- but according to meteorologists, it won't be as severe.

The upcoming front of icy temperatures is expected to first bring arctic air to southern Canada, then move into the northern plains of the U.S. before moving to the Midwest and East Coast -- each of which is still recovering from last week's frigid temperatures.

...and by the middle of week residents near the Great Lakes should expect lake-effect snow. North Central states and states in the interior Northeast are expected to see temperatures at or below zero

'Following the retreat of arctic air 
this weekend, waves of progressively colder will move southward over 
Canada next week,' AccuWeather.com Lead Long-Range Forecaster Paul 
Pastelok told AOL.com.

The new arctic blast is due to the northern 
plains by Monday, the lower Mississippi Valley and Midwest on Tuesday and 
on Wednesday then the East on Thursday.

Like the last bout of icy air, this one is the result of a portion of the polar vortex breaking away from the Arctic Circle.

'We
 will likely see a piece of the polar vortex break off and set up just 
north of the Great Lakes spanning Jan. 16 to 20,' Mr Pastelok said.

'This next main arctic blast will not rival, nor will be as extensive as the event this past week,' he continued.

Unlike
 the last push of cold air, weather experts expect temperatures to stay 
above zero in most locations in the Ohio Valley, central Appalachians, 
the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest.

North Central states and states in the interior Northeast, however, are expected to see temperatures at or below zero.

Additionally, anyone near the Great Lakes should also expect lake-effect snow.

There is also a chance that the cold air could deposit snow in parts of the South and along the East coast later in the week.

Weather maps for the middle of next week show the polar vortex creeping back across the U.S.

Many areas are still recovering from 
the extreme weather last week, which has caused a dam of ice to block 
the Delaware river in New Jersey, forcing roads to close and causing a 
severe flood risk.

A 
Coast Guard ice cutter has been called in to try to clear shipping lanes
 but after 2 and half miles the 2ft ice had become to thick to break up.

Chunks of ice have been building up for days near the Trenton Makes Bridge, ABC News reported. But with the sudden warm temperatures, it is feared a fast thaw will flood low-lying areas.

'If
 in fact the ice jam breaks then we'll have a rush of water which could 
cause flash flooding,' Qareeb Bashir, of Trenton Emergency Management, 
said.

Flash flood 
warnings are in place in several of the regions affected by the polar 
vortex, as rain falling on the already frozen ground is forced to run 
off.

Nearly all of Pennsylvania is under a flood warning after the sudden rise in temperatures caused a faster than usual thaw.

A chaotic scene of ice chunks could be seen stretching across the state's Susquehanna river near Harrisburg on Saturday morning.

But
 the thaw is likely to be halted by the new cold front coming in, even 
though it is not expected to be as severe as the one last week.
