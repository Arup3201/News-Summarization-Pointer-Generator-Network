As a lone RAF wartime aircraft circled a blue sky in the Peak District this morning, the landscape looked a picturesque scene of tranquility and calm.

But sixty-nine years ago today, the view from the ground looked very different as the brave Dam Busters crew took to the air, practicing for a stealth mission to destroy Germany's dams during World War Two.

Today a flying company offered war enthusiasts the chance to follow the identical flight path over the Howden, Derwent and Ladybower dams in a original Tiger Moth biplane - the aircraft the elite Lancaster squadron would have learnt to fly in.

Step back in time: A Second World War Tiger Moth flies low over Derwent Reservoir, retracing the steps of Dam Buster Lancaster pilots who trained there

Taking to the skies: Dam Buster Lancaster pilots trained in the Peak District 69 years ago today ahead of their bouncing-bomb attack on Germany on 17 May 1943

Scenic view: The nostalgic flight is just one of many being flown by this original Tiger Moth biplane. It gives people the chance to experience the practice route over the Derbyshire reservoirs in an original World War Two aircraft

Mission: Eight aircraft, such as the Lancaster pictured, failed to return, 53 men were killed and three became prisoners of war

The aircrew from 617 Squadron headed to the Derwent Valley to train in extreme low-level flying in bombers in preparation to destroy dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley using top-secret ‘bouncing bombs’.

The Derwent Dam and it’s surrounding hills resembled that of some of the German dams so formed a perfect training ground for the elite Lancaster squadron.

Pilot, Will Flanagan, 32, said: 'All the Lancaster pilots would have learnt to fly in a Tiger Moth just like this one.

'I
fly as low as I can on the ‘Dam Buster Run Missions’ but I can’t imagine
how they managed to fly those bombers at only sixty feet above the 
water – especially with people shooting at them.

'I
get a buzz from flying it, the provenance, smell and feel of an open 
cockpit – there’s nothing like feeling the wind blowing through your 
hair – it’s what I’d call real flying.

'I recently flew an RAF veteran who’d
worked as a ground based engineer on Lancasters during the war – he had
never flown in a Lancaster but wanted to know what it felt like to fly 
over the dams. He found it very emotional – it’s a very nostalgic trip 
for some of the older guys.

'This
is the only World War Two aircraft that you can fly the Dam Busters 
route in. The trip takes about an hour and you can even have a go at 
flying as we run in over the water.

Mr Flanagan, who is also a flying instructor and examiner runs Blue Eye Aviation 
from Netherthorpe Airfield near Sheffield, with his fiancé, and pilot 
father Richard.

'Twelve years ago I happened, 
by-chance, to be flying over Lincolnshire next to a Lancaster – it was 
part of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. Seeing it inspired me to 
get into vintage aircraft. My dream finally came true when we set up the
company and bought our Tiger Moth last September. We’ve only been 
flying it since the end of March and it’s already becoming very popular.

'After
the war you could buy an ex RAF Tiger Moth for £60 – or two for £100. 
They’ve gone up a bit now – we paid £57,000 for ours,' said Mr Flanagan.

The 1930s designed, de Havilland DH82 Tiger Moth was a multi-role aircraft.

In its different forms it was used as a trainer, for reconnaissance, and as a light bomber.

Experience: Pilot Will Flanagan, said: 'I fly as low as I can on the Dam Buster Run Missions but I can't imagine how they managed to fly those bombers at only sixty feet above the water - especially with people shooting at them'

Legacy: Today there are thought to be about 150 Tiger Moth biplane's left in the UK - most of these are kept in private collections with only a handful still being flown commercially

The aircraft’s 6.1 litre engine produces 130 horsepower giving it a top speed of 153mph.

The
canvas covered aeroplane remained in service until 1951 with a total of
8800 built.

Today there are thought to be about 150 left in the UK – 
most of these are kept in private collections with only a handful still 
being flown commercially.

A plan to dislocate vital German war 
industries in the Ruhr by breaching the dams which supplied their water 
and electric power was first conceived in 1937.

But
it was only in 1942, that there were bombs which had the capacity to 
destroy the dams and the aircraft which were able to deliver them.

The bouncing bomb was developed by 
Barnes Wallis and he designed a revolving depth charge bomb which the 
Lancaster plane would be able to carry - it weighed 9,250 lbs.

In late March 1943, No. 617 Squadron, commanded by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, was formed.

Its
aircrew, were mostly volunteers and experienced personnel - they were 
from Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.

On
16 May, starting at 9.28pm, 133 aircrew in 19 Lancasters took off in 
three waves along two different routes to bomb the dams.

Gibson attacked first at the Möhne at 12.28am, but five bombs were dropped before it was breached.

The
first wave’s three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the Eder
which finally collapsed at 1.52am. Aircraft from the other two waves 
bombed the Sorpe but it remained intact.

Eight aircraft failed to return, 53 men were killed and three became prisoners of war.

Although
the operation was not a complete success, for without the destruction 
of the Sorpe its effect on German industry was less than hoped, it was 
still hailed as a mission of extreme skills and bravery.

An hour’s run flying the Dam Buster route in the Tiger Moth costs £425.
