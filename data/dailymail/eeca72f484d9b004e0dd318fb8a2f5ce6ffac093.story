Labour’s outspoken adviser Bill Grimsey, the former Wickes DIY chain boss and author of the controversial report on run-down town centres, is involved in a long-running feud with David Cameron’s rival ‘shopping tsar’ Mary Portas.

TV star Ms Portas carried out her own review of struggling towns, which led to the Portas pilot scheme, under which 12 towns shared £1.2million of taxpayers’ money.

A £10million high street innovation fund was also set up.

However, former Iceland and Wickes chief executive Mr Grimsey accused Ms Portas of using her Government role  to promote her Mary Queen of Shops TV programme.

He dismissed her plans as ‘nostalgic, little more than a PR stunt’ and said she ‘promised the Earth and delivered little’.

He added witheringly: ‘If you ask a window dresser to write a report, what you will get is window dressing.’

She hit back, accusing him of ‘talking complete rubbish’ and claiming he had tried to line his own pockets by writing a book, Sold Out, about the issue.

‘I must have done something to Bill Grimsey in a former life,’ said retail guru Ms Portas.

‘He says the high street is dead. That does not sound like someone who really cares about the high street to me.’

Brandon Lewis, the Conservative Minister responsible for town centres, said Ms Portas had done  a ‘phenomenal job’.
