The new custody agreement for Michael Jackson’s children is expected to be signed off by superstar Diana Ross.

Jackson named the 68-year-old legend as back up guardian to his three children in his will, after his mother Katherine.

She had been the sole carer of Prince Michael, 15, Paris, 14 and 10-year-old Blanket but in the new agreement will share custody of the children with her grandson Tito Joe 'TJ' Jackson.'

Close: Michael Jackson appointed Diana Ross as the back up guardian for his three children in the event of his death so she has to sign off custody arrangements

A source told RadarOnline: 'Diana has no qualms whatsoever about the new custody agreement, she only wants what is best for the children.

Diana knows that the children are old enough to decide who they want to live with and she defers to what they want.

'While Diana hasn't been a big part of their lives because she lives on the East Coast, she is very fond of them.'

Katherine was stripped of her guardianship last week with temporary custody going to TJ before they worked out a new arrangement.

The judge ordered both Diana and Prince Michael and Paris’ mother Debbie Rowe be informed.

The paperwork is expected to be submitted this week for shared custody and the judge will have to sign off the proposed agreement before it becomes official.

Meanwhile, Katherine’s attorney Perry Sanders says Prince Michael is happy with the new arrangement after discussing it with TJ.

He told X17online: 'There's a close bond there and a definite sense of unity. Contrary to what people think, there was absolutely zero animosity between those two. I felt nothing but love in the room.'

children

Meanwhile, the childrens' former nanny, Grace Rwaramba told Radar that Michael would be horrified by his children being in the public eye so much, and asks that the public be fair to Paris Jackson and 'give her a chance to make and learn from her mistakes without demonizing her.

'She is a spirited, very expressive and dramatic young girl. The traits that made her the apple of her father's eye are the same traits that she must learn to control as she matures into adulthood.'

Michael's children Prince, Paris and Blanket live with their grandmother Katherine Jackson in a gated community in suburban Calabasas that is more private than the family's longtime home in Encino, which is on a public street. 

During bizarre scenes Randy, Janet and Jermaine apparently burst into the home, demanding that the children come with 
them. Police were called and ‘two male adults became violent’, according
to police officers. 

Need to be safe: Katherine and her grandchildren live at the home

The angry confrontation last Monday, caught on 
security camera, included Janet Jackson confronting Paris and allegedly 
calling her ‘a spoiled little bitch’.

The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is investigating the scuffle as a possible battery.

Jackson had previously been helping his grandmother care for his cousins, to whom he is close.

Confusion: Katherine Jackson is seen making a statement as she resurfaced last week after ten days without any contact with her grandchildren; her children Janet and Jermaine are stood behind her

Blocked: Jermaine and Janet are believed to have been blocked from the family home, along with brother Randy; Janet and Jermaine are seen arguing with Michael's children on surveillance footage

Katherine Jackson's attorney Perry Sanders J. said last week that TJ Jackson would take over day-to-day operations and staff oversight at the Calabasas home.

The move will free Katherine Jackson to focus on the upbringing of the children, who range in ages from 10 to 15, Sanders said. 

Siblings Randy, Janet, Rebbie and Jermaine Jackson have signed a letter calling on the executors of Jackson's estate to resign.

Randy Jackson has accused the executors, attorney John Branca and music executive John McClain, of trying to isolate Katherine Jackson from relatives who are critical of them. 

'It is my fear and belief, that they are trying to take my mother's life,' Randy Jackson wrote last week. 

Randy Jackson has also claimed his brother's will is a fake, a claim the estate denies.
