A Perth breast imaging clinic and a former doctor have been fined a total of $100,000 for false and misleading conduct after promoting their services as an alternative to mammograms.

The Federal Court on Friday ordered Breast Check Pty Ltd to pay $75,000 and former doctor Alexandra Boyd $25,000 for making claims in contravention of the Australian Consumer Law that put patient's lives at risk.

In misleading pamphlets, the clinic claimed either a Thermography Device alone or in conjunction with the Multifrequency Electrical Impedance Mammograph, known as a MEM device, could assess whether a person was at risk of breast cancer. 

The Court also found that Breast Check had represented that there was an adequate scientific basis for using the devices as a substitute for mammography, when that was not the case. 

Ms Boyd was found to have been knowingly involved in the clinic's deceptive conduct.

In his judgement, Justice Michael Barker said the key issue was the potential to divert customers from using a medically recognised form of breast imaging.

'Even if only one consumer has been so diverted to their detriment, the consequences to a person's health may be very serious, and at worst, fatal,' he said. 'That is not something that can be measured solely in monetary terms and it is of no assistance to say the conduct was only directed to a small number of individuals.'

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it was particularly concerned that Breast Check made such significant health related claims without a proper scientific basis.

'Consumers are entitled to expect that breast imaging services would be provided in a way that is consistent with credible scientific knowledge,' said ACCC Commissioner Sarah Court in a statement. 

'If consumers relied on Breast Check’s representations instead of using conventional breast cancer investigation methods including mammography, then potentially breast cancers could have gone undiagnosed,' she said. 

If consumers relied on Breast Check’s representations, 'breast cancers could have gone undiagnosed,' said the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 

Last week the Court ordered another breast imaging provider, Safe Breast Imaging Pty Ltd, to pay penalties of $200,000 for similar contraventions of the ACL.

Breast Check, now called PO Health Professionals Pty Ltd, no longer provides breast imaging services.
