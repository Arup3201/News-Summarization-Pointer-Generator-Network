The FBI has joined the frantic hunt for a female American tourist missing in Aruba, as authorities on the Caribbean island continued to hold her supposed travel partner who insists she drowned in a snorkelling accident.

Gary Giordano, from Maryland, is being held in prison on the island as authorities stepped up the effort to fins out what 
happened to his friend, 35-year-old Robyn Gardner.

He has said she 
disappeared in a tragic accident while they were snorkeling off the western tip of the 
island.

Giordano was detained on Friday as he tried to leave Aruba.

'The suspect is standing by his story that they went snorkelling and that Robyn did not resurface,' Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said.

Earlier,
the prosecutor's office said it decided to detain Giordano because of questions about information he 
gave police about the disappearance. Prosecutors have not said what 
prompted their suspicions.

Gardner's younger brother, Andrew Colson, said Giordano seemed too calm when his mother came to Aruba to help find her daughter.

'He didn't seem very sorrowful. He wasn't mournful or anything,' Colson said in a phone interview from Odenton, Maryland.

Colson,
who last saw his sister in May, said Aruban authorities asked them not 
to discuss the case in detail, but that they do not believe Giordano's 
account of what happened. He said she was unlikely to have been 
snorkelling in the first place.

'I think there's more to it,' he said. 'She just wouldn't want to ruin her make-up or get her hair wet.'

Giordano's Aruban lawyer, Michael Lopez, said his client was being unjustly held.

'Our client emphatically denies being
involved in any malicious act concerning his friend and consequently 
does not consider himself a suspect,' Lopez said in a written statement.

The two Americans had been in Aruba a
couple of days when they decided to go snorkelling on August 2 near an 
area known as Baby Beach, Lopez said.

He added that the pair eventually 
realised they were being pulled out to sea by the current and Giordano 
tapped on Gardner's leg to signal that they should swim back. When he 
got to shore, he noticed she wasn't with him and ran to get help after 
looking for her unsuccessfully in the water, the lawyer said.

Lopez said that in the following 
days, Giordano assisted with the search and answered questions from 
police. He said his client waited until the woman's mother arrived 
before he decided he should return to the U.S. Giordano says he was 
given permission to leave by an official at the U.S. consulate on the 
nearby island of Curacao, the lawyer said.

The U.S. vice consul, Winnie Hofstetter, declined to comment on the case.

Lopez said that after being detained,
Giordano initially declined to cooperate further with prosecutors and 
police because he felt he was being wrongly detained.

'As judicial representative of our 
client we can say that after reading and analysing everything there is 
until now in his case file, there is no concrete or direct indication 
that our client might be involved in any illicit act concerning his 
friend,' Lopez said.

New video of the search shows Giordano accompanying police as they searched the water around where he said Gardner disappeared.

Worried: Ms Gardner's boyfriend of two-and-a-half years, Richard Forester, has made a public appeal for help as the search continues

Giordano is from Gaithersburg, Maryland. His lawyer said he runs an employment agency.

Earlier today, news emerged Giordana was
divorced from his ex-wife in 2008 'amid allegations of domestic 
violence' during which she obtained a restraining order, according to 
court reports.

At least one other woman sought a similar order against him, Gawker reported.

Giordano, who also has several arrests on his record for thefts under $500.

Gardner, a 5ft 5in blonde with 
prominent tattoos on her arm, rib cage and right bicep, had worked in 
the past as a patient care coordinator at a dental office in Bethesda, 
Maryland, said said Richard A Forester, who said he was her boyfriend.

Forester said Gardner lived much of 
the time with him in Rockville, Maryland, and had said that she and 
Giordano were platonic friends. The pair were scheduled to spend about 
five days in Aruba, Forester said.

'I'm starting to believe that's not 
true,' Forester said in a phone interview. 'I'm starting to believe 
there was some romantic thing.'

Forester said he and Gardner had been
in contact through Facebook until just before she disappeared. After 
she vanished, her Google Chat indicators showed she was active on Gmail,
then on but not active, and finally off, he said. It seemed to indicate
that she or someone else had been on her Gmail account, he said.

'I'm terrified as to what may have 
happened to her,' he said. 'I'm sad and scared that I might not see her 
again. I love her very much and all I am concerned about is that she 
gets home safely.'

Forester earlier, told WJLA 7 News he had a fight 
with Gardner shortly before she left for the vacation on July 31.

'The last message I got from her was, "I love you, we'll talk and sort things out when I get back,"' Mr Forester said.He described Mr Giordano as a rival 
for Ms Gardner's affections and said he does not believe Mr Giordano's 
account.

'I just don't think that she was snorkelling. I just feel in my heart that something happened at this person's hand,' he said.

'We went on vacations and I couldn't even get her to put her head under water in the pool.

'She
was into makeup and hair and knowing her she would have had a few 
cocktails already and would only be getting ready to go out that nigh,' he continued. 

Robyn Gardner's wild and rowdy tattoos belie the kind, quiet nature of a trusting woman who sought solace in a tropical getaway with a man who is now suspected in her disappearance, a close friend added.

'She's a very trusting person,' former room mate Christina Jones said at her hair salon in downtown Frederick. 'She's a hardworking, loyal, standup female who has never said anything bad about anyone.'

Aruba has experience dealing with 
missing person cases following the still unsolved disappearance of 
Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway during a high school class trip to the
island in 2005. Her remains were never found and the main suspect, 
Joran van der Sloot, is in jail in Peru on charges of killing a 
21-year-old woman last May.

The FBI is still looking for leads in the disappearance of the 18-year-old Natalee Holloway, who vanished on the island of Aruba while on a high school graduation holiday in 2005.

Twenty-three-year-old Dutchman Joran Van der Sloot has long been suspected in the case. He was the last person seen with her and was subsequently arrested.

Van der Sloot is now suspected of murdering a young woman in Peru, where he is in prison and awaiting trial. He has several times confessed then recanted a role in the disappearance of Holloway, and has also been indicted by U.S. authorities for his alleged involvement in a plot to extort $250,000 from Holloway's family for information on her death and the location of her body.

No charges have ever been filed in the Holloway case. And the Alabama teenager's body has never been found.

In April, the National Enquirer reported a Peruvian prison informant said van der Sloot had confessed to the crime  while they were imprisoned in the country's notorious Miguel Castro Castro jail, and allegedly said he murdered Holloway because she refused to have sex with him

Van der Sloot, who is awaiting trial for the brutal murder of 21-year-old business student Stephany Flores, also allegedly used a laptop to email a friend the gruesome details of Holloway's  murder.

He is being held in Lima's Castro prison, where his lawyer said he gives English lessons to other inmates.

The break in the case gives fresh hope to Natalee's mother, Beth Twitty, who has been desperate for information on the whereabouts of her daughter for six years.

Ms Twitty launched the Natalee Holloway Resource Centre last year, a non-profit resource centre to assist families of missing persons.
