We've all had those stubborn blemishes - the angry red mark on your face that refuses to disappear, no matter how many ointments and cleaners you apply. 

Well, now help may be at hand thanks to the  technology experts at Sony.

The company has launched a new product called BeautyExplorer, which analyses all of the components in your skin, including pores, moisture, melanin, grease and pigmentation.

The small skin view camera takes close-up pictures of the skin's surface as well as skin analysing sensors that use  multiple wavelength light source controls, and skin-analyzing algorithms to work out the condition of the skin.

As well as examining the surface of the skin, the sensors are also able to reach the layers just underneath, which would usually be invisible to the naked eye.   

The idea is that a person can then work out what toiletries will be most useful to deal with a certain problem area.  

A spokesperson for the company explains: 'It can tell you all you need to know about any unwanted blemishes, pores, brightness or colouring that has had the misfortune of gracing your face.'

The new technology will make it easier for men and women to determine the reasons behind blemishes and spots (picture posed by model|) 

They continued: 'Furthermore, pigmentation on and beneath the surface of the skin can be viewed by conducting pixel-by-pixel analysis of melanin in the skin, thus enabling information to be obtained about non-visible skin, including concealed markings and blemishes. 

'Alas, we can’t develop an app that will remove them just yet (we’re not that good), but surely half of the battle is knowing that they’re there.'

The program will also store the data on a cloud, so the user can get a detailed graph of how their skin condition has changed over time by using different products.
