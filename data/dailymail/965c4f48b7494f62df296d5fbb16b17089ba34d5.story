A jealous ex who tried to kill his former girlfriend's new partner as he slept in a savage machete attack  has been jailed for 22 years.

Gary Johnson had burst into Holly Dobson's house and began punching then hacking at  Christopher Spinks, 27, as he lay in bed, a court heard. 

Slashing at his face and body, the vicious attack left the victim with serious injuries including one blow which went down to the bone, and another which split his ear in two.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how the 26-year-old broke into Holly Dobson's home in  Stanley, County Durham, at around 4.45am on August 9 last year. 

Ms Dobson, 31, said she tried to stop the attack on her new boyfriend of three weeks by grabbing Johnson's shoulders but she was unable to move him. 

Sarah Mallet, prosecuting, told the court during the trial: 'Christopher Spinks was still asleep naked in bed when he was attacked.

'Holly Dobson was panicking, she was unsure whether to stop the attack or find her phone and ring the police. Her partner's ear was split open, his leg was split open and she could see the bone.' 

Johnson replied to her pleas to stop attacking the victim by saying: 'I'll kill him, I am going to kill him.' 

Mr Spinks sustained major injuries with his ear cut in two after Johnson broke attacked him with a machete while he was asleep

When Ms Dobson dialled 999, Johnson allegedly ran from the house taking the machete with him before being arrested by police.

She later told police: 'It was absolutely horrendous, he was like a caged animal. 'I tried to pull him off when he was punching him but I couldn't move him.  He was fixed on hurting him.'

'I wish I had never met him,' she added in her victim statement.

The court heard during the trial how Johnson was in a relationship with Ms Dobson for two years before she broke up with him due to his possessive behaviour.

Johnson was sentenced after he was convicted by a jury of attempted murder.

Mr Justice Males, sentencing, said the attack could easily have killed Mr Spinks.

The judge said: 'The injuries which Christopher Spinks suffered were very severe. He had deep cuts to his nose and right cheek, a deep cut down to the bone on the left side of his scalp, and a cut to his left ear which split it in two.

'He also had deep wounds on his left leg, one of which was right down to the bone, which caused significant damage to his muscles and an important nerve.

'These were serious injuries on a defenceless man which could easily have killed him.'

The court heard how Johnson, 26  from  Chester-le-Street, had a stormy relationship with his ex-partner for about two years. He had a conviction for violence on Ms Dobson, and he was 'intensely jealous' of any contact she had with other men, the judge said.

The unprovoked attack with the 'vicious looking machete' left Mr Spinks suffering from panic attacks, having thoughts of suicide and requiring a leg brace, the judge said.

Johnson, who has a young daughter, had sent a series of threatening text messages to his ex-partner in the hours before he travelled five miles to her home.

He wrote: '(Mr Spinks) wants to hope he's not at our house like defo', and, 'tell him I'm waiting for him even if I have got to wait for ages'. 

The judge said: 'So there was a degree of planning and deliberation about your conduct and you wanted Holly Dobson to know what you were doing.'

He imposed a life-long restraining order preventing Johnson from going within 100 metres of his ex-girlfriend or Mr Spinks.

Outside court, Detective Inspector Gavin Heckles said: 'This was a savage and premeditated assault on Mr Spinks, which left him with serious psychological as well as physical injuries.

The judge said the attack could easily have killed the defenceless Mr Spinks (now recovered after the horrific assault) 

'Johnson showed no remorse at any time during our investigation and interviews with him, and the comments from the judge summed up perfectly just how serious this was.

'I hope the substantial sentence will provide at least a measure of comfort to Mr Spinks and his family.'

Mr Spinks, who suffered serious, gaping flesh wounds, said he had gone to bed on the evening of the attack and woke up in hospital. 

'They told me that someone tried to kill me in my sleep. I didn't know how to take it. I couldn't believe it, I was laughing when they first told me. I thought I was dreaming. It was a big shock.'

He branded his attacker a 'coward' in a victim statement to the court and speaking after the verdict said his life had been 'ruined' by the assault.

'I have suffered leg injuries, facial injuries and I had one of my front teeth kicked out. I had to stay in hospital for a couple of days while I got stitched up so I could come out. 'I am still recovering now. I have to keep my leg in a brace. The attack has made me scared all the time.

'Holly and I split up because of the attack but we stayed good friends. Our relationship was good up until that point. 

'I'm happy he can't hurt anyone else.'
