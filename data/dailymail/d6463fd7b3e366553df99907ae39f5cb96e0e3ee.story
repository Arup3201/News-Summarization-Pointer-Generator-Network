A woman was mauled by a caged bear at a wildlife center after sticking her arms through the bars in the hope of petting it.

The unnamed 54-year-old was touring Wildlife Haven Rehab in Dade City, Florida, in the hope of adopting two birds.

But when she spotted the 400-pound black bear, named Abner, resting in a cafe, she thrust her arm through.

Her limb was badly mauled by the bear, which attacked almost immediately, according to local news station WTSP.

Sheriff's deputies in the area would not elaborate on the wound, but said her arm had been 'severely damaged'.

She was flown to nearby Tampa General Hospital for treatment.

The attack took place around 3:45pm Friday. Abner is one of three bears who lives at the site, which also houses a panther and an alligator.

According to the sanctuary's owner, Abner was donated to Wildlife Haven a year and a half ago.

The case is now under investigation.
