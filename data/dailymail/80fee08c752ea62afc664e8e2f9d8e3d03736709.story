England’s players showed solidarity with their cash-strapped opponents at the final whistle as they gathered for a silent prayer on the Twickenham turf. 

Captain Chris Robshaw and his team-mates formed a circle with Samoa — who had threatened to boycott the game in a row over pay and governance with their union.

‘That is the brilliant thing about the rugby community,’ said Robshaw. ‘You support each other. They could have pulled out, so we’re extremely grateful they honoured the game.’

'We want to thank all the Samoan guys for the way they played, we know they've got a lot of issues at the moment and all the England guys are really appreciative of the spirit and the way the game was played today,' he told Sky Sports 2.

'I think it was a great spectacle, even if it was a bit loose at times, but all the English team are very grateful.'

Another thing the English players will be grateful for is the win after a torrid run of five defeats on the bounce was finally brought to an end.

All of those defeats, of course, came against the two top ranked teams in the world in New Zealand and South Africa, but Robshaw admitted it was great to just get back to winning ways.

'It was great to get a win. It's a results business and we know there was a few errors out there and we were a little bit loose with the ball, but it was great to play a game here at night and the crowd were absolutely fantastic,' he added.

Despite looking disjointed at times England still managed to run in three tries, with Jonny May dotting down twice and Mike Brown crossing over after a delightful offload from Anthony Watson.

One of the biggest positives was the performance of new fly-half George Ford, who played a key role in May's first try with a loop around Owen Farrell and then set up Brown's touch down with a well-worked cross-field kick to Bath team-mate Watson.

Speaking in front of the Sky cameras after his first senior start for England, the 21-year-old, who also kicked over 13 points, said: 'I think we got there in the end. The start was very scrappy. Obviously, Samoa are a very physical team and they came flying at us.

'We probably didn't adapt to that quickly enough I suppose and with the rain coming down we should have gone for field position. But we addressed that at half-time, came out and started the second half well.'
