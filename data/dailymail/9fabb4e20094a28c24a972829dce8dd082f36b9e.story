Would you say yes to this prickly proposal?

Dressed in a green body suit, a man proposed in the Shijingshan district of Beijing as 'Cactuar', a character from the video game franchise Final Fantasy.

Possibly the game's biggest fan, the man known as Mr Wu, was seen in the middle of a shopping mall bending down on one knee and reciting a Final Fantasy-themed proposal to his girlfriend Min Min.

The proposal was placed online by a friend of 'Cactuar', and those passing by who captured the 'intimate moments' between the couple as he proposed.

While holding a colourful bouquet of flowers and while donning the green 'Cactuar' costume, Mr Wu said to his beloved:  'I've loved you since Final Fantasy VII, and now we're all the way up to Final Fantasy XIV. It's been so long, and I've never had another in my eyes. I finally have the courage to say this: Min Min, will you marry me?!'

The Final Fantasy spectacle made for a happy ending, when Min Min thankfully accepted 'Cactuar's' proposal.

This is the third romantic stunt in China over the past few weeks, but some Chinese viewers are questioning whether this could be just a publicity stunt for the upcoming release of Final Fantasy XIV.

According to china.com the quirky proposal was no stunt. In fact, the 14 year court-ship began when Mr Wu, 12-years-old, first met the then 10-year-old Min Min.

Min Min says YES!

 

'You always said that I'm not romantic, that I don't care for you. Please forgive me! Do you know how excited I am right now? I'm very scared, I waited a long time for this. You might think this costume is strange but did you know Cactuars always strive for love? Looking back at the time, I've loved you since Final Fantasy VII, and now we're all the way up to Final Fantasy XIV. It's been so long, and I've never had another in my eyes. I finally have the courage to say this: Min Min, will you marry me?!'
