Bad reaction: BBC producer James Whitmarsh

A BBC producer accused of groping a paramedic claims he was not in control of his actions – because he was suffering from a bad reaction to seafood at the time, a court heard.

Friends called an ambulance for James Whitmarsh, 41, when he began answering questions with the word ‘Honk’ after a seafood starter at a restaurant in London.

As he was being treated, he grabbed the female paramedic’s bottom and groped her between her legs.

Whitmarsh claims he was not responsible for his actions after the Christmas meal.

As he was being treated in the back of
the vehicle he grabbed the paramedic’s bottom and groped her between 
her legs, the court heard.

Whitmarsh denies sexually assaulting the medic, claiming he was not responsible for his actions after the Christmas meal.

Prosecutor
Victoria Ailes told Southwark Crown Court: ‘Put very shortly what James
Whitmarsh is accused of is sexually assaulting a paramedic who was 
treating him in an ambulance by touching her through her clothing.

‘You
may be wondering what the defence might be and, put very shortly again,
and you will hear a great deal more about this, the defence is that 
this is not something that James Whitmarsh did deliberately at all, his 
actions were not under his control because he was having a bad reaction 
or suffering from a toxin as a result of some fish or seafood he ate for
dinner.’

Ms Ailes told the jury Whitmarsh had 
gone out with friends on December 13 and after a drink had gone for a 
meal at a restaurant near Covent Garden.

She said: ‘There were five of them in the party and they all had drinks and they went out for dinner.

‘In the course of the trial you will want to pay close attention to the evidence about how much alcohol was drunk and the extent to which that might provide and explanation for what happened.

‘In outline it seems that he James 
Whitmarsh, even by his own admission, had a pint of lager before the 
party went for dinner and that Prosecco, white wine and red wine were 
drunk with dinner.

‘There were also oysters and smoked salmon which were consumed as part of the starter.’

The
prosecutor said that during the course of the dinner Whitmarsh’s 
friends became concerned at the way he was behaving and called an 
ambulance.

She said: ‘He was unsteady on his feet. He was swinging his arms around and when he was asked how he was he intermittently answered them with wither ‘Yes’, ‘No’, or ‘Honk’.

‘The conclusion of the group was that he was drunk.

‘When he had been in the ambulance and under the care of the paramedics for some time, around fifteen minutes, one of the paramedics had her back to him.

‘In the course of his treatment he reached out towards her lower body.'

He then sexually assaulted her, the court was told.

The paramedic and her colleague, an emergency medical technician, said Whitmarsh had been acting strangely when they arrived at Covent Garden station.

Before getting into the ambulance, the paramedic said Whitmarsh was 'smirking a lot and found the situation to be funny.'

When initially asked some questions about his conditions, he refused to answer and 'just smirked.'

The paramedic said when he did speak all he would do was 'Honk' and that as he was getting into the ambulance he had reached out to her colleague to grab her chest.

Whitmarsh had then tried to grab her chest area and groin whilst she was doing routine medical checks, the paramedic said.

It was when she was then leaning over to a the ECG machine that the BBC employee sexually assaulted the paramedic with an open hand.

'I felt his hand reach underneath and grab me. I could feel his fingers, so I wouldn't call his touch soft. His hand was grabbing at me as he groped, she said.

Also giving evidence, the medical technician said that she had warned Whitmarsh about his behaviour.

'If you touch us, we will have to involve the police. You are making life changing decisions here,' she said.

According to Whitmarsh’s website he has worked as a new media producer since 1994 and is currently working for BBC Radio in London.

Whitmarsh, from Devizes, Wiltshire, denies sexual assault.

The trial continues.
