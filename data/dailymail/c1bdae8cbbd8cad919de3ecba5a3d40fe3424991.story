Forgotten man Marko Marin is edging closer to a move away from Stamford Bridge as he undergoes a medical at Serie A side Fiorentina.

The 25-year-old has struggled for regular football since joining Chelsea from Werder Bremen in 2012, consequently making just six appearances in the two years since.

He spent the last campaign on loan at Seville but upon his return to Stamford Bridge was told he was not part of Jose Mourinho's plans this season.

All smiles: Marko Marin is closing in on a move to Serie A side Fiorentina from Chelsea

Happier days: Marin turns towards the Chelsea faithful after scoring in a 4-1 win over Wigan in 2013

Tenacious: Marin did produce some positive displays for Chelsea in their Europa League campaign last year

Therefore Marin has been looking at alternatives elsewhere, in turn agreeing a season-long loan deal with the Italian side.

If he is a success there Fiorentina may look to take up the option of signing the German permanently for £4.2million next summer.

Either way Marin has a battle to get his career back on track after a disappointing spell at Chelsea, but his form in the past for Werder Bremen will give Fiorentina renewed hope he can get back to his best.
