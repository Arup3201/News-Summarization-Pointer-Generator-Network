A father who was spotted digging an 8ft hole on a popular tourist beach has been criticised for putting his life in danger.

The unidentified man dug the pit while he was with his family at Gorleston Beach near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, last Thursday.

Local resident Steven Gilder, 55, was left horrified at his actions just three months after a girl nearly died when a structure half as deep caved in and trapped her.

The unidentified man was seen digging a hole on Gorleston Beach near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, last week while a little girl, believed to be his daughter, kneeled precariously close to the edge

The grandfather claims the top of the 'dangerously deep' hole was  around 2ft higher than the man's head.

Mr Gilder added that a little girl, who appeared to be the man's daughter, was also seen running around the edge of the hole.

Now he has urged visitors and locals to take care on the beach - and not put any lives in danger.

Mr Gilder, who lives near the beach, said: 'I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. Mother, and I assume her daughter, were playing happily together while the dad was digging a sand hole that was about two foot above is head. You could hardly see him.

'The little girl, who couldn't have been older than four, was running around the top edge of the hole. I just want to remind holidaymakers that it's not sensible.'

The incident comes three months after Coastwatch volunteers had to step in to save a young girl from a 4ft deep hole which caved in on nearby Caister beach.

The man's head is barely visible as a he continues to dig the unstable pit next to members of his family 

A member of the rescue team watched as the girl 'disappeared' inside the pit which she and her family had dug in the sand.

Fearing the sides of the hole could have collapsed at any minute the watchkeeper stepped in and advised her family to get her out.

Volunteer Alan Perry said at the time: 'People, especially those on holiday, don't always see the dangers in front of them.

'We were up in the watchtower and we'd been keeping an eye on them, but it was when the girl got in and you couldn't see her that we knew we had to step in.'
