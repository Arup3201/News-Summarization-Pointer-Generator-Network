The relationship between Ishant Sharma and Indian cricket fans has often resembled that of a rather tempestuous couple.

It began, as these things usually do, with a teenage infatuation.

When the 18-year-old from Delhi burst on the scene with pace, accuracy and menace – and immediately tied even the great Ricky Ponting in all manner of knots - we dared to ask whether India had found its first quick bowler since Kapil Dev to match the country’s long line of spinning greats?

And that’s not to mention the attraction of the wild hair, jangling necklaces and extreme height (us Indians are quite a short bunch).

But in subsequent years he proved to be a huge disappointment. He developed no consistent away swinger to complement his natural inswing towards right-handers, and picked up a serious problem bowling no balls. There was no increase in pace - if anything, he got slower.

The relationship soured and even turned abusive, as Ishant became the biggest butt of jokes in India after the nation’s corrupt politicians. Whole websites sprung up devoted to ridiculing everything from his massive mane - ‘the only Indian object visible from space’ - to the awards he should have won for services to Australian sport when his team were whitewashed Down Under.

By the time he was selected for this English tour the old love had crossed that fine line into hate, with several observers incredulously questioning how someone with a bowling average over 37 could have somehow won 55 Test caps and still be in line for more.

Now, however, the pendulum may be swinging back. There appears to be a reconciliation on the cards.

With speed, aggression and a huge amount of heart, Ishant not only blew away the England batting line-up with seven for 74 in the second innings at Lord’s but also won back his place in the affection of Indian folk.

Some have even removed the old barbs from their Facebook pages, and quite rightly too. Ishant, who is still only 25, probably played the biggest role of all in what could rank as India’s greatest ever victory away from home soil.

They had no right to win the second Test, and take a one-nil lead in the series, after being put in to bat first on a pitch that was as green as the outfield.

They won because their bowlers understood better than England how to bowl in these most English of conditions. They bowled full and straight with an upright seam and let the pitch and humidity do the rest.

Ishant was at the forefront of implementing this simple discipline – seemingly forgotten by James Anderson, Stuart Broad et al – which helped push India into a winning position on the final day. And then, with England’s last recognised batsmen threatening to tilt the game back in their team’s favour, came the most remarkable act of all in this fascinating Test match.

Having been told by his captain to abandon his traditional line and length, Ishant bowled bouncer after bouncer. England accepted the bait and - one after another - hooked and pulled the ball to the hands of gleeful fielders standing in the deep.

Steaming in: Ishant ran in hard on the final afternoon and gave England some chin music

Tests: 57 Debut: vs Bangladesh, 2007

Runs: 515 Highest score: 31* Average: 9.36 Catches: 12 

Wickets: 174 Best bowling (inns): 7/74 Best bowling (match): 10/108 5wkt innings: 6 10wkt match: 1    

It may have been a lemming-like act of collective suicide on England’s part, but huge credit is also due to Ishant. In baking heat on a fifth day pitch and with an 80-over old ball, he banged the ball in short with relentless energy and passion.

In his last seven overs he took five wickets for 27 runs and won the match, using tactics very rarely associated with an Indian bowler. He outdid the English at their own game.

It turned out that the final match-winning strategy was actually down to the skipper MS Dhoni, who admitted he coaxed a reluctant Ishant into following his wishes by setting a field that gave him no option but to bowl short.

Indeed, Dhoni’s innovative thinking throughout the match – can anyone ever remember a wicketkeeper standing several yards back to a spinner? - provided a sharp contrast to the ponderous captaincy of his beleaguered opposite number, Alastair Cook.

Dhoni and Ishant are the only members of this team who have played Test matches in England, and they are doing an excellent job of guiding their inexperienced team-mates.

The innocuous-looking seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar, in particular, is the emerging star of this tour. While he may be a humble and unassuming character who will never quite live up to his first name – it literally translates as ‘Lord of the Earth’ – he is certainly exercising a degree of dominion over this series with not only the ball but also the bat.

At the top of the batting order the opener Murali Vijay is proving a rock-like presence, and it is encouraging that Ajinkya Rahane is standing out above his more illustrious colleagues in the middle order.

Even Ravindra Jadeja managed to win over a hostile home crowd, who initially booed him at every opportunity over his spat with Jimmy Anderson, with his swashbuckling 68 runs in the second innings that swung a hitherto even game in India’s favour on the fourth day.

His exuberant sword-swishing celebration on reaching his half century – a tribute to the traditions of his warrior Rajput caste – showed that, like Ishant, he has plenty of personality.

The whole team, in fact, is proving that it has to be taken seriously after a long run of crushing and sometimes embarrassing results away from home. As England are quickly realising, this India side is no joke.
