With a beautiful sunrise coming over the horizon, it seems a shame to stay indoors - but that doesn't apply if you're looking through the cupola windows of the International Space Station.

Earlier this month, an astronaut noticed a sunrise while the Station rolled over the South Pacific, 240 miles northeast of the Marshall Islands - and pulled out a camera to capture the moment.

'The International Space Station was over the central South Pacific about 240 miles northeast of the Marshall Islands when one of the Expedition 31 crew members positioned on the station's Cupola captured this image of the sun coming up,' says a Nasa spokesperson.

Expedition 31 is the current Space Station mission, which began on April 27 this year after the previous crew left for Earth on board a Soyuz TMA-22 re-entry vehicle.

The mission is scheduled to continue until July 2013. The Station recently docked with Space X's unmanned Dragon capsule, which was the first commercial space flight to dock with the station.

Incredible: Astronaut Don Pettit took these pictures 240 miles above Earth from the International Space Station

Known as ‘star trail’ pictures, they are taken over a period of 10-15 minutes by cameras mounted inside the station.

However, Pettit found that using the latest digital cameras meant that he had to combine several images to create the effect.

'My star trail images are made by taking a time exposure of about 10 to 15 minutes,' he said.

'However, with modern digital cameras, 30 seconds is about the longest exposure possible, due to electronic detector noise effectively snowing out the image.

'To achieve the longer exposures I do what many amateur astronomers do. I take multiple 30-second exposures, then 'stack' them using imaging software, thus producing the longer exposure,' the astronaut explained.

A total of 46 images photographed by the astronaut-monitored stationary camera in the Cupola were combined to create this composite.

Spot the difference: Pettit's pictures look like images from sci fi epic 2001: A Space Odyssey. This is a still from the film

Success: Pettit, left, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, successfully entered the SpaceX Dragon capsule on Saturday. The Dragon is the world's first commercial spaceship

Pettit has taken hundreds of images during his time on the space station, including several of the Space Station’s most recent visitor, the SpaceX Dragon capsule.

He is one of six astronauts currently living aboard the station along withfellow NASA astronaut Joe Acaba, European astronaut Andre Kuipers, and Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko, Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin.

The team is set to spend Memorial Day unpacking cargo from the Dragon Capsule.
