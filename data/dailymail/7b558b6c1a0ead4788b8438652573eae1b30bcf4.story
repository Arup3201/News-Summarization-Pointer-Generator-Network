A Texas man has been arrested for allegedly shooting dead his wife of three years as she was on the phone with a 911 dispatcher.

Tommy George Dooley, 51, was arrested outside his home in Granbury early Friday morning and charged with murder in the killing of his wife, 65-year-old LaVera Aiken Dooley.

According to Hood County Sheriff's officials, at around 10pm Thursday they got a 911 call from Mrs Dooley, who told the operator she was afraid her husband was going to shoot her.

The bloody incident played out outside the Dooleys' home on Colonial Drive in Granbury, Texas 

The dispatcher then heard the sound of multiple gunshots over the phone. Moments later, the woman's husband, Tommy Dooley, called police.

Deputies who responded to the couple's home in the 6600 block of Colonian Drive in the gated community of Pecan Plantation discovered LaVera Dooley fatally shot inside her car, reported NBC DFW.

Investigators say the victim sustained six gunshot wounds. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

According to sheriff's deputies, the woman was trying to back out of her driveway but was unable to flee because her husband's car was blocking her way.

She called police from her locked vehicle, and that is when Tommy Dooley allegedly came outside and shot her through the car's windows.

Mr Dooley is being held in jail on $500,000 bond.

Both the husband and wife worked in the insurance business. The couple have grown children from past relationships.

Just days earlier, Mrs Dooley posted on her Facebook page photos from her wedding, which took place in 2011.

In the pictures, a beaming LaVera Aiken Dooley is seen in a black lace gown holding a bouquet of sunflowers, with her new husband standing by her side.

According to local police, the newlyweds had a history of domestic disturbance calls.

The Dallas Morning News' Crime Blog reported that the most recent incident took place January 20, but police say no one was arrested at that time.
