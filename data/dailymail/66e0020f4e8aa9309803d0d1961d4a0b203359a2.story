She's recently appeared on screen with Ben Affleck in Gone Girl, but as these pictures show, Emily Ratajkowski hasn't forgotten how to work it in front of the camera.

The British-born American model-turned-actress looks super seductive on silk sheets in the new campaign for Italian lingerie brand Yamamay and in the behind-the-scenes shots.

The beautiful images show 23-year-old Emily, who shot to fame in Robin Thicke’s steamy music video for Blurred Lines, wearing the lace and silk lingerie.

The collection includes suspenders, babydolls, body, nightgowns, briefs and push-up bras in a black, red and white colour palette, some with gemstone detailing.

'Yamamay has created an elegant and romantic collection which is very similar to my style,' Emily said of the lingerie.

'They make you feel sexy and confident,' she added.

Talking about her style, the brunette said, 'I like to emphasise my body and my femininity, but at the same time I want to wear comfortable clothing and underwear.

'They make you feel sexy and confident,' Emily said of the collection 

'I think lingerie is the display of one’s personality. I don’t choose a particular outfit thinking about who will see it, but I search something for myself that makes me feel beautiful and pretty.'

Emily also admitted that her recent role in Gone Girl, in which she played alongside Ben Affleck as his mistress, was the most daunting of her career. 

The  actress said she grew up watching Affleck on screen and was never quite able to get her head around making out with the 42-year-old Hollywood star.

Asked what it was like getting intimate with the Argo actor, Emily said: 'The whole experience was a little surreal.'

'Now I’m receiving interesting offers, but I want to be very careful with my career as an actress,'  Emily says

But she also said that working the megastar Ben and director David Fincher was a precious experience. 

'It was the best acting school one could ever imagine. Both David and Ben are perfectionists and I’ve learnt a lot from them. They taught me a few tricks and gave me advice that will be useful in the future.

'Now I’m receiving many interesting offers, but I want to be very careful with my career as an actress.' But in the meantime, she says she's  not giving up on her modelling career.

The actress will next appear in the Entourage film playing herself. The film, expected for release next summer, will bring the popular HBO  series which ended in 2011 onto the big screen.
