They are popular with the likes of Boris Johnson and Beyonce.

But selfie sticks, the extendable rods used by people to take photographs of themselves with mobile phones, have now been banned in the National Gallery.

The move follows bans in galleries in France and America – including the Palace of Versailles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

The National Gallery has banned selfie sticks - extendable rods used by people to take photographs of themselves. The British Museum (pictured, visitors taking a snap with the Elgin Marbles) is revising its policy

The National Gallery, which allowed cameras for the first time last year, is expelling the gadgets because they fall under the category of ‘tripods’, which are already prohibited.

Esther Saunders-Deutsch, a spokeswoman for the gallery, said: 'Photography is allowed for personal, non-commercial purposes in the National Gallery – however there are a few exceptions in order to protect paintings, copyright of loans, individual privacy and the overall visitor experience. Therefore the use of flash and tripods is not permitted.

'Our gallery assistants and visitor facing staff are fully briefed and instructed to ensure we are striking the correct balance between visitor experience and the security and safety of works on display. 

'Therefore they will use their discretion on a case by case basis in preventing photography which puts the safety of the collection at risk or obstructs other visitors.' 

Paul Reynolds visited the National Gallery in London on December 31 and took this selfie. Writing on Twitter, he said: 'So I went to London's National Gallery and there was selfie sticks everywhere'

While Katie Morais, from the British Museum, said: 'Visitors to the British Museum are permitted to take photographs in public areas, not including temporary exhibitions, for non-commercial purposes. 

'The museum is currently reviewing its policy on the use of "selfie-sticks" and other apparatus within the museum grounds. 

'The safety of objects and visitors is paramount to the British Museum and staff will politely inform visitors if the use of any equipment is endangering objects or other people on site.'

Selfie sticks are currently allowed at the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate and the Victoria and Albert Museum in Kensington. 

A spokesperson from the National Portrait Gallery said: 'It is important that all our visitors enjoy their experience at the gallery and anything that may prove disruptive is reviewed on an ongoing basis.'

Nina Sandhaus from the Victoria and Albert Museum, said: 'Visitors to the V&A are currently permitted to use selfie sticks in line with the museum’s general policy on photographing and filming with a hand-held camera for personal use.' 

The rods were one of the most popular Christmas gifts last year and Boris Johnson, Beyonce and Barack Obama - who used one during a video promotion at the White House - are among those seen with the devices. 

Tottenham Hotspur banned selfie sticks from White Hart Lane after a complaint from a fan, while they have also been barred at a number of galleries and museums in the US and France.

The online Collins dictionary describes a selfie stick as 'an elongated stick to which you attach a camera or mobile phone to take a better photo'.  

Art critic Brian Sewell told The Times: ‘If the Americans and French were banning them, the UK should join in. They are possibly quite dangerous to the art work and cause appalling crowding around a painting.

‘Anyone who actually wants to go and see a painting can’t because people are too busy taking photos. I’ve seen things in the National Gallery which make my hair stand on end.’

Even Mar Dixon, 44, who organises an event which encourages youngsters to take a selfie in front of famous pieces of art, says the ban is a good idea.

She branded the tools 'damaging' to precious works, and said they get in everyone's way. 

Visitors to the National Gallery backed the ban today, including, Morny Davison, who was waiting for the Inventing Impressionism exhibition to open.

She said: 'It is an interference in what one hopes is a reasonably calm experience looking at great pictures.'

Another woman, who did not wish to be named, said art lovers would be 'thrilled' by the ban.

'It’s becoming impossible to see pictures,' she said. 'First there’s people with cameras then there’s cameras with sticks. They should have been banned some time ago.'

The sticks first took off in Britain last summer as a wave of tourists arrived armed with them and by Christmas the rods were one of the most popular gifts on Amazon. 

The sticks cost anywhere between £5 and £30 and can be bought in technology stores or online.

They are extendable and allow the user to attach a smartphone and take a picture of their face using a timer or Bluetooth.

The National Gallery's decision comes after the Palace of Versailles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York also outlawed the devices
