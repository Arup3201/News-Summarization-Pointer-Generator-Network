Just when I thought it was safe to step out in skinny jeans, along comes a trend to knock me off my fashion fulcrum, catapulting me back in time to the Seventies. Yes, flares are back.

Part of me doesn’t give a damn about trends. By the time you get to 60 you know what suits you - or at least you should. But though sticking to what you know may stop you becoming a fashion victim, it could also leave you looking like a style Neanderthal.

I only started wearing skinny jeans - thanks to two perfectly-fitting pairs from Gap and Comptoir des Cotonniers - in 2011. That was six years after Jane Shepherdson brought her skinny ‘Baxter’ style to the High Street when she was brand director of Top Shop.

SUMMER WHITE: These are way too Elizabeth Hurleyfor me, although I bet the TOWIE girls will go mad forthem... White flared jeans, £34.99, mango.com. Blue blouse, £110, reiss.com

ORANGE SILK: More Katharine Hepburn palazzo pants than Farrah Fawcett flares, these feel grown-up and glamorous - perfect for a cocktail party, preferably on a yacht. Orange flares, £198, theoutnet.com. Blouse, £30, newlook.co.uk

EXTRA WIDE LEG: Teamed with a navy blazer, these extra wide flares look smart and sophisticated - I could see Carole Middleton on a shopping trip with the Duchess of Cambridge wearing these.Jeans, £216, Mother: 02075808644 Top, £25.99, blazer, £79.99, zara.com

BELL BOTTOMS: These would be great to go out in at night, and are as comfy as leggings to wear in the day. Slim boot-cut, £220, Goldsign at trilogystores.co.uk. Jacket, £60, and top, £25, topshop.com

PALE DENIM: These were very long, but with heels they give an impressively leggy look. Beware the short flare - you’ll look like a Bay City Roller.The Skinny Marrakesh, £182, mih-jeans.com. Blouse, £145, Pyrus at trilogystores.com. Belt, £9.99, zara.com

While all this was going on I adamant that skinny was only for the very young.

However,
when I dared to wear them, I felt I looked both fresher and more 
fashionable. So, rather than wait six years to try the flares trend, I 
decided to accept the challenge to give it a go now.

When it comes to the flares revival, Victoria Beckham is the woman we have to thank (or blame).

She has flaunted her love affair with flares in J Brand’s ‘Love Story’ bell-bottoms, as well as her signature, dark blue raw denims from her eponymous collection.  

And it’s not just Victoria Beckham 
flying the flares flag in 2013.

Gwyneth Paltrow has worn hers on the red
carpet, while Stella McCartney and Roksanda Ilincic featured them in 
their collections.

On the High Street, Oasis and Debenhams have seen 
sales of flared trousers jump 57 per cent over the last year.

In spite of all this, I have to say I
groaned when I saw the rail of flares in front of me.

However, after 
trying them on, I realised just how much they’d moved on since their 
Seventies heyday.

Like most jeans today, they have a degree of stretch 
which means they fit better and hold their shape, resulting in less 
flapping around your ankles.

And when it comes to slimming and 
elongating your legs - especially if you team them with high heels or 
wedges - they are little short of miraculous.

If you’re more chubby than chive, 
skinnies really don’t do you any favours, so the return of the flare 
should be welcomed both by larger women and those on the vertically 
challenged side, too.
