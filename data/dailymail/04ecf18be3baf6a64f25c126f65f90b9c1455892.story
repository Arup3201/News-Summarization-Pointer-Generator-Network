She was just 15 years old when she and her brother were offered their own TV show, but Marie Osmond reveals the pressures placed on her were immense. 

'I had producers take me out into the parking lot when I was 103 pounds and tell me that I was obese, disgusting and a disgrace to my family. That I needed to keep food out of my fat face,' the 55-year-old Dancing With The Stars vet told Closer Weekly.

She was told The Donny & Marie Show would be canceled if she didn't lose weight and so she starved herself down to 97 pounds.

In the spotlight: Marie Osmond revealed to the new issue of Closer Weekly that she was told she was 'disgusting' for weighing 103 pounds when she was  just 15-years-old on The Donny & Marie Show

Too fat?: Marie, pictured on stage with Donny in 1975, was hauled over the coals by TV producers who said she was obese and disgusting  and The Donny & Marie Show would be axed unless she lost weight

Surviving stardom: Now 55 and a grandmother, Marie has come through battles with weight and with depression and credits her faith and her family for helping her deal with the pressures of fame; her she is pictured in April 2014

Lasting stars: Donny and Marie talked to Closer Weekly for the 40th anniversary of their show

The producers knew just what buttons to push for the teen raised in the strict Mormon faith. The thought not only of being fat but of being responsible for everyone involved in the show weighed heavily.

'This sent me on a head trip - that 250 people could lose their jobs because of me,' she told Closer.

The pressure to be thin continued long after The Donny & Marie Show ended in 1979 after four years, and plunged the star into a life-long battle with her weight.

'I was very young': The only girl in the Osmond family, Marie, pictured in 1974,  topped the charts in 1973 with Paper Roses but described her first recording session two years earlier as 'a terrifying experience'

In the spotlight: Donny was 17 and Marie was 15 when their weekly variety show began airing in 1976 and the only Osmond girl starved herself to lose weight, dropping down to 97 pounds

There were other demands, too, placed on Marie and her brother Donny, who was 17 when the show started in 1976.

The youngsters often worked  20-hour days and each week they had to learn new songs and dance routines and memorize scripts.

They also hosted celebrity guests and that brought other problems with it for the pretty Osmond sister.

'I was very young and I remember Groucho Marx pinching my butt,' Marie said. 'He was a dirty old man.' 

Marie and Donny, who have been selling out shows at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas since 2008, sat down with Closer to mark the 40th anniversary of being offered their ABC show.

At 15, the Paper Roses singer was already a showbiz veteran.

She was 12 when she was taken to her first recording session, something she says was 'the most terrifying experience.'

'It was a full orchestra and rhythm section. I was the only Osmond girl, what if I failed?' she said. 'So I threw up! Then I went in and sang.'

A brother-and-sister act: The Osmonds were famous around the globe for their dazzling white smiles, and also for the Mormon faith that helped protect them from the temptations that came their way after finding fame

Mutual support: The pair have helped each other through the ups and downs of life after The Donny & Marie Show ended and Donny told Closer his sister has 'been through some horrific times'

Marie, the only girl in a family with eight boys, found fame in the wake of her brothers' worldwide success.

Her older brothers Alan, Wayne, Merril and Jay had been performing since they were children and appeared regularly on TV's The Andy Williams Show throughout the 1960s. 

They were later joined by Donny and youngest brother Jimmy and enjoyed a successful pop career in the early 1970s, including performing backup for Donny's solo hits Go Away Little Girl and Puppy Love.

After being convinced to join the Osmonds bandwagon, Marie recorded the song Paper Roses when she was 14 and it soared to the top of the country music charts and made number five on the Billboard charts.

Still performing: 40 years on, the Donny and Marie show is going strong and they continue to entertain their legions of fans with their Las Vegas revue at the Flamingo Hotel that's been selling out since 2008

Today she is sanguine about finding fame at such a young age.

'I didn't have a childhood because I had a different kind of life,' she said. 'I didn't have a normal dating life or friends, but I don't know that anyone's life is perfect.'

There's no question that Marie's life has been a tumultuous one with perhaps more than her fair share of ups and downs.

She's had two husbands, one she married twice, and given birth to three children.

In 1999, she revealed her struggles with severe post-natal depression.

She also adopted five children with her second husband Brian Blosil, whom she has since divorced.

Her son Michael committed suicide in 2010 after a lifelong battle with depression.

Showbiz veterans: Marie, 55, and Donny, 57, continue to pursue solo careers and the Puppy Love singer and teen heartthrob  said that looking back, it's the good times that he remembers, and not the bad

Now 55 and a grandmother, Marie credits her religion and her family for helping her get through the tough times and ultimately surviving the perils of becoming famous so young.

'It all boils down to keeping God first, then family. It's a formula that has helped us through a lot of things,' she said. 'A lot of people think I was naive, but you're not naive growing up in this business. I grew up fast.'

Her brother Donny agrees that there is satisfaction in surviving and indeed thriving as the pair continue to entertain their many fans today.

'I look back at my life as all these peaks and valleys, and Donny & Marie happens to be a peak, Donny told Closer. 'The bad times dissipate and you only remember the good.'
