As World Cup fever sweeps across the United States a barber in San Antonio has embraced the tournament’s popularity by taking the unusual step of styling footballers’ portraits into people’s hair.

In recent weeks Rob Ferrel, owner of Rob the Original Barbershop, has sculpted the faces of Cristiano Ronaldo, Tim Howard and Guillermo Ochoa as part of a haircut.

Though Ronaldo’s Portugal side were knocked out in the group stages, both USA goalkeeper Howard and Mexico goalkeeper Ochoa will be playing in the knockout stages.

How about that? Rob Ferrel styles USA goalkeeper Tim Howard's face into someone's hair

World Cup fever: Ferrel posts a collage of his football-themed cuts

Eight years ago Ferrel was working at a barbershop in Texas when local kids started bringing in requests for hair art.

‘At first it was simple patterns and designs, but now if they bring me any image, I can replicate it in their hair,’ he says on his website.

Ferrel is now a professional hair artist in San Antonio, though he is still willing to do customised cuts if people ask.

When his 
local basketball team San Antonio Spurs were playing Miami Heat in the 
NBA finals earlier this month, fans of both teams requested 
basketball-themed styles.

Real deal: Another of Ferrel's designs, this time of Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo

His toolkit includes standard barber clippers and razors, as well as coloured eyeliner for the finishing touches.

‘I create every shape and shade on the portrait - like a puzzle,’ says Ferrel. ‘You can only do so much with hair, so the eyeliner perfects the picture and makes it look realistic.’

Shotstopper: Ferrel has also done a style based on the portrait of Mexico's star goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa
