Sophie Ellis-Bextor has spoken out about the sexualisation of young girls.

The signer and mother-of-three, 34, has said she is glad that her children are boys because having a girl anywhere from about eight to 18 'would be a really sensitive issue'.

'Girls are encouraged to put their sexuality out there as an empowering thing, but that can also put you on the back foot,' she says.

Sophie, who came fourth in the latest series of Strictly Come Dancing, has three sons under the age of 10 with her husband, Feeling bassist Richard Jones.

Speaking to the Telegraph's Seven magazine, she says that while she doesn't feel she should comment on what anyone else are up to, she has noticed a difference in pop stars' attitudes now compared to the 1990s.

'There were as many debates about Madonna
 then as there are about Miley Cyrus now. But Madonna always seemed to 
be in control of what she was doing...

'For me, the reason things get debated is because the context or intention is not owned in the right way by whoever's doing it... I think you should always try and gauge the look in someone's eyes, see if they comprehend what they're doing and the images they're playing with.'

Sophie admits that getting pregnant within weeks of meeting Richard came as a huge shock, but it was her mother, Blue Peter presenter Janet Ellis, who promised her everything would turn out for the best.

'I don't think you could ever be confident that it would work out OK. But mum said to me, "It might not be the right time, it might not be the right man, but it's the right baby," she said in a recent interview.

Not long after giving birth to her first child, Sophie decided to commemorate the huge moment in her life with a large heart tattoo on her arm, which she's been showing off in recent weeks.

The singer admits that she received a lot of Twitter hate over the statement ink though.

'I had it done just after we had Sonny. There was a horrible reaction on Twitter. It's a bit perverse but I thought, "Ha ha, fine, I didn't do it for you".'

'I like the fact that it suggests you don't know everything about me, and contrasts with what you might think of me. '

The couple now have three boys, Sonny who will turn 10 in April, Kit, four and Ray, 18 months.
