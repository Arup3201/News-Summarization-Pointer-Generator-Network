A Colorado dog owner has been left without his furry friend after the animal was grabbed off the street by a mountain lion, who killed and ate the canine.

The incident last week in a Colorado Springs, Colorado, gated community, was the third such attack in two months.

The unidentified man told authorities that he was walking his Dachshund when the mountain lion sprung out of some bushes and grabbed the dog - leash and all - and ran off.

Attack: A dog owner has been left without his furry friend after the animal was grabbed off the street by a mountain lion, like the one seen here, who killed and ate the canine

Michael Seraphin, spokesman for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told KOAA-TV: 'The mountain lion came out from some bushes that are in close proximity to the street that he was walking on, grabbed the Dachshund, and tucked and pulled hard enough to yank the leash out of his hand.'

The cougar then killed the small dog and ate it.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesman Michael Seraphin said the mountain lion was deemed a threat to public safety and a plan was set to capture it after the incident last Wednesday.

Several hours after the attack, the mountain lion was successfully trapped.

KOAA-TV reported that the animal was euthanized and sent to Fort Collins for a necropsy, where remnants of the Daschund were discovered in the cougar's stomach.

CBS Denver reported that the incident was the third cougar encounter in the last two months, and residents claim it's been going on for years.

An
unidentified neighbor told the station: 'We know there are mountain 
lions in the area, there have been other attacks several years ago.

She added: 'Our backyard neighbor - a mountain lion climbed a tree and jumped onto her deck and took her dog.'

While the prey of mountain lions is limited mainly to deer, there have been instances where they have attacked people.

Colorado Parks & Wildlife officials urge anyone who may come face-to-face with a mountain lion to remain calm and move away slowly from the animal while talking firmly.

It's important not to run. If a mountain lion acts aggressively, a person can throw sticks, rocks or branches to ward it off, as the cat will generally not attack prey that fights back.

Problem: Residents of the Colorado gated community say that encounters with cougars have been going on for the last few years
