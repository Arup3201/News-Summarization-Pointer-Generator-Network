Wealthy: Businessman Robert Johnson says he is not bothered by the loss of his £100,000 Bentley

A lottery winner who spent part of his winnings on a £100,000 Bentley saw his prized possession written off when he tried to drive through a flooded road.

Robert Johnson bought the luxury car after landing a £5million jackpot in 2008, and it was his 'pride and joy' until it was destroyed yesterday morning.

But the wealthy businessman insisted he was not overly upset by the loss - and revealed he had already bought a brand-new Mercedes to replace it.

The 65-year-old management 
consultant, from Hereford, was on his way to a meeting when he became 
stuck in flood water in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire.

He
was driving along a country lane on the outskirts of town when the 
black Bentley Continental GT was swamped by three feet of water from a 
stream which had burst its banks.

An
AA rescue truck soon arrived at the scene, but could not remove the car
as Bentleys can only be towed from the front and Mr Johnson's car was 
accessible only from the back.

Soon
the flood waters rose so high that the AA truck could not reach the car
at all, and Mr Johnson, a grandfather and father of four, was forced to
abandon it altogether.

Mr Johnson won £5million on the lottery in 2008, but decided not to go public with his winnings.

And speaking today from his modest 
home in Ocle Pychard, a hamlet just outside Hereford, he revealed he had
been quick to replace his expensive car.

'I don't know what all the fuss is about, it's just a flooded Bentley,' he said. 'I've gone out and got a new car. Job done.'

Destroyed: A lottery winner's £100,000 Bentley Continental GT has been written off after getting stranded in flood water in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire

Damage: The flooding came nearly as far as the steering wheel, destroying the car's interior

Home: Mr Johnson's cottage in Ocle Pychard, a hamlet outside Hereford - visible are his new Mercedes, which he bought to replace the Bentley, and a vintage Land Rover fitted out with a vehicle snorkel

Bernard
Robinson, who has been friends with Mr Johnson for three decades, said the pair had been due to meet on Wednesday morning when Mr Johnson drove into the flood.

'Robert
was on his way to see me for a business meeting when he got stuck,' Mr 
Robinson said. 'He rang me and said, "I can't see you today because I've
wrecked my car in the bloody floods."

'He's
driven down that road, even when it was flooded, hundreds of times 
before. He obviously misjudged how deep it was and when he pressed the 
accelerator the wheels just span and the car started to float off.

'Apparently water was gushing through the bottom of the car but he managed to open the door and wade to safety.'

Misjudgement: Mr Johnson apparently knew the road well and was over-confident about his chances of getting through

Rescue: Another man was seen retrieving the keys to the Bentley after the driver had abandoned it

Confusion: Mr Johnson might have been misled by the fact that he owns another car which has a snorkel

Mr Robinson added that Mr 
Johnson had carried on working after his lottery win, as he has three 
ex-wives to support - and claimed that despite his wealth, the businessman 
was devastated to see his £100,000 car damaged beyond repair.

'He
is gutted, he loved that car,' Mr Robinson said. 'It was his pride and 
joy, and writing off a £100,000 car is not going to put you in the best 
of moods.

'I've known him 30 years but he's not the friendliest of people - even after his big win.

'Robert also has a 1940 Land Rover with a snorkel, which he probably thought he was driving when he went through the floods.'

Warning: Mr Johnson will be wishing he had heeded the nearby sign pointing out the wet conditions

Wildlife: The floods may be bad news for motorists, but they have been a boon for aquatic birds

Neighbours yesterday described Robert as a 'flash Harry' who would quickly recover from the loss of his car.

One said: 'Bob is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. A bit of a wheeler dealer but a smashing bloke.

'He has always worked hard and then he got very lucky with his big lottery win.

'He's
always been a bit of a flash Harry and I don't think losing his Bentley
in the floods would have ruffled his feathers too much when he got over
the initial shock.'
