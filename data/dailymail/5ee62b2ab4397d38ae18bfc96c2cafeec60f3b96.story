Swimmers and surfers were evacuated from the water at Bondi Beach after the shark alarm went off this morning.

Lifesavers scoured the surf on jetskis and speed boats and several helicopters buzzed the iconic Sydney strip before giving the beach an all-clear this afternoon. 

Today's scare occurred when a police helicopter spotted a bull shark in the surf.

A NSW police spokeswoman said their helicopter was flying nearby when they made the sighting.

'They were just doing a flyover and spotted it and radioed the lifesavers on the ground,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

Hundreds of beachgoers, including Sweaty Betty PR queen Roxy Jacenko, were on the beach at the time of the incident. 

Bull sharks are considered dangerous due to their aggressive nature, powerful jaws and preference for shallow coastal waters, according to the NSW Department of Primary Industries.  

It is the peak of the summer holiday season with Sydney temperatures expected to reach a high of 28 degrees Celsius. 

Paddlers were forced out of the water just two months ago after two great white sharks were found dead in the nets.

A Waverly Council spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the waters were not very clear today because of overcast conditions.
