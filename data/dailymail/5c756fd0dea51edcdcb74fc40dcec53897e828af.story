Professor Sir Brian Jarman, a senior Government health adviser, claims more than 20,000 lives could have been saved if ministers and the NHS had paid attention to alerts about higher than average mortality rates

Labour was warned of alarmingly high death rates in 25 NHS hospitals and told inspections by health watchdogs appeared ‘fundamentally flawed’, a leaked email reveals today.   

Professor Sir Brian Jarman, a senior Government health adviser, claims more than 20,000 lives could have been saved if ministers and the NHS had paid attention to alerts about higher than average mortality rates.

In an email sent in 2010, seen by the Daily Mail, he gave the then Health Secretary Andy Burnham a list of hospitals where he warned there were alarming numbers of patient deaths.

Several of those hospitals have now been the subject of a Government review into their high mortality ratios, due to be unveiled to MPs today.

NHS medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh is set to detail failings at 14 trusts in England thought to have been responsible for up to 13,000 excess deaths going back years.

He is expected to describe poor care, medical errors and management blunders, suggesting that the Stafford hospital scandal was far from a one-off. 

Tories will seize on the findings to attack Labour’s handling of the health service.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to tell MPs today that at least ten of the trusts are being placed in ‘special measures’, with NHS troubleshooters sent in to take over their management and high risk services suspended.

In the leaked email, Professor Jarman, a former president of the British Medical Association and expert on hospital death rates who now advises the Government, noted Mr Burnham’s ‘public statements that you are dedicated to reducing death rates in English hospitals’.

He said he had send data identifying 25 hospital trusts which in 2007/08 had one of several ‘mortality alerts’ or over 150 more deaths than expected in that year.

Professor Jarman noted that Basildon and Thurrock, Tameside and Mid Staffordshire trusts had had high mortality rates for around ten years - but had been deemed to have ‘fair’ or ‘good’ levels of care by watchdogs.

Saying a process of ‘self assessment’ used by health regulators ‘may be fundamentally flawed’, he said ‘on-site’ inspections suggested poor standards at all three. 

‘I realise that on-site inspections are relatively expensive but I thought that it might be possible to arrange on-site inspections for the high HSMR [hospital standardised mortality rates] hospitals,’ he added. 

Mid Staffs went on to be at the centre of the biggest NHS scandal in a generation. A review of deaths at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust by police and other officials has identified hundreds of cases between 2005 and 2009 where poor care could have led to deaths.

In all, Professor Jarman estimated the deaths at the trusts he identified amounted to 4,609 in 2007/08 and over 20,000 in total.

In a reply to his letter, sent in April 2010 as the parties prepared for a general election the following month, a junior health minister, Baroness Thornton, told him it would be more appropriate to take up his concerns with the Care Quality Commission. 

A Tory source said: ‘This is yet further evidence that Andy Burnham personally had information about failing trusts which he failed to act upon. Labour claim to be the party of the NHS but ignoring warning signs and covering up failure lets down both the NHS and the patients it serves.’ 

Conservative MP Priti Patel tabled the questions in Parliament suggesting more than 1,500 further representations were made to Labour ministers about the trusts with high death rates

Six of the 14 hospitals which have been subject of Professor Keogh’s review were on the original list sent to Mr Burnham, now Labour’s shadow health secretary: Basildon, Tameside, Colchester, Blackpool, George Eliot in Warwickshire and United Lincolnshire.

Separately, questions in Parliament suggested more than 1,500 further representations were made to Labour ministers about the trusts with high death rates.

They included over 400 letters about United Lincolnshire, 300 letters about Blackpool and over 200 letters about Basildon.

Conservative MP Priti Patel, who tabled the questions, said: ‘Andy Burnham must take responsibility for Labour’s record: thousands of unnecessary deaths, an appalling cover-up on his watch, and a wall of silence.

'New evidence suggests Labour ignored more than 1,500 warnings about these hospitals, where there was terrible suffering and cruelty.

'Andy Burnham must now apologise to the families who lost loved ones. He must publish the official papers he is keeping secret. And he must support the NHS reforms that the Conservatives are making, to put caring back at the heart of our NHS.’

Labour has strongly denied putting pressure on the healthcare regulator and other NHS organisations to cover up bad news in the run up to the 2010 general election. 

The party is expected to attempt to blame falling numbers of staff in areas such as midwifery and a decline in meeting its four -hour A&E target as being responsible for some of the latest failures in the NHS.

A source close to Ed Miliband said: ‘In every one of these hospital trusts we are seeing standards declining, not because of what Andy Burnham did. This government has spent £3 billion on an unnecessary reorganisation of the NHS.'

‘We will reject what is a political attempt by this government to undermine the health service.’
