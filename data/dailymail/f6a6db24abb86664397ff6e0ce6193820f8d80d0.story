All kinds of forms of transport are going electric these days, as scientists and engineers dream up new ways to get us around without spewing clouds of harmful fossil fuel emissions.

But they have perhaps gone a little far this time, by electrifying one form of transport that never actually caused any greenhouse gases at all.

The Mando Footloose is claimed to be built around the world's first chainless hybrid technology for an e-bike.

Something seems to be missing... The Mondo Footloose claims to be the world's first e-bike to operate without a chain

Like other pedelecs the Footloose combines manual and electric power. However, unlike other similar machines, it totally eliminates the chain and transforms the cyclist's efforts directly into electricity to drive the wheels.

Made by Korean auto-parts supplier Mando Corp, the Footloose is based on the premise that the chain is the most annoying component in most bikes, Gizmag reports.

So instead of using one to drive the 
wheels, the bike's pedals transform the riders kinetic energy directly 
into electricity via an alternator connected to the crank.

Compact: When not in use the Footloose folds up for easy carriage on public transport or in the boot of a car

This energy is then stored in a lithium-ion battery inside the bikes frame, before it is converted back into kinetic energy by an electric motor which drives the rear wheel.

Like a modern car, the Footloose has an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) which works with sensors to monitor terrain and an automatic gear changer to adjust the motor's output to suit.

This ECU also monitors the contraption to identify any problems, which it then displays by means of a handlebar mounted HMI (Human Machine Interface).

The HMI, which also gives the rider data about distance travelled, speed and the amount of electricity produced, is removable and doubles as an integrated anti-theft device since the bike will only start if its connected.

Mando have not announced a price for the product, but it has been reported that it is scheduled for release some time in 2013. However, critics point out that the overall efficiency of the machine may be a weak point.

With a chain-drive working out at about 98 per cent efficient, it is difficult for any new technology to equal the raw capabilities of a standard bicycle.
