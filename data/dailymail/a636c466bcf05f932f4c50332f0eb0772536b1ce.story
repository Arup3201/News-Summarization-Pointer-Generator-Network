A Russian breast-feeding expert has been arrested on suspicion of being a cult leader, it has emerged.

Zhanna Tsaregradskaya, director of the Rozhana Centre, in Kaluga, near Moscow, was detained by the country's counter-extremism police claiming the pre-natal facility was 'a sect with a strict hierarchical structure,' TIME reported.

While breast feeding is encouraged in the west, it is contrary to common practise in Soviet and Russian medicine.

The centre, which was established in 1989 and helped re-introduce home births in Russia, offers training courses for midwives and expectant mothers interested in having a home birth, its website states.

Tsaregradskaya taught seminars on breast feeding and natural births at the centre.

In their statement, released on Friday, police investigators revealed they have charged Tsaregradskaya on two counts - one of 'creating a non-commercial organisation that encroaches on the personalities and rights of citizens' and a second of 'the incitement of hatred and hostility'.

If convicted of the charges, Tsaregradskaya faces up to seven years in prison. Investigators claim she 'steered mothers away from traditional principles'.

The statement went on to say the centre's 'followers', thought to number 14, were taught to 'reject the family as a social institution, to act negatively toward their spouses (men), to refuse medical help, education, work and military service'.

It said the centre used 'physical and psychological violence' to maintain control over its followers, teaching them disobedience towards the norms of society.

Tsaregradskaya, who has been released pending her trial, did not respond to requests for comment from TIME.

A co-ordinator at the centre did deny that any violence or 'brainwashing' was used in their training courses.

'We provide free phone consultations to mothers who are having trouble breast-feeding, or who simply want to know more about it,' the co-ordinator told TIME.

'We have no idea why our director has been singled out like this.

'We can’t figure out why there’s this witch hunt now. Maybe it’s just a fear of the unfamiliar,' said the woman called Anna, who declined to give her surname because she was not authorised to speak to the press.

She said the hotline will function as normal and no police officers have come to shut them down.

In 2010 the Rozhana Centre faced legal problems, when a dozen disgruntled clients visited the live-in facilty in Kaluga to retrieve property they claimed to have left.

Police statements and media reports said Tsaregradskaya accused them of failing to pay. When they insisted on being allowed inside, her husband fired shots at them with a 'traumatic pistol,' a gun sold widely in Russia. Two of the husbands of the centre's clients were injured.

Police closed the facility and last year Tsaregradskaya's husband Andrei was jailed for five years for assault.

On Friday, the lawyer who defended Mr Tsaregradskaya's victims, Alina Pokrovskaya, appeared on Russian television. She said: 'There is a great demand among women to organise natural births, because these methods have been lost in our country.

'Unfortunately, even our grandmothers have lost this know-how. And our doctors do not accommodate such needs.'

Under the Soviet Union child birth was the sole responsibility of state-run clinics. Midwives and private clinics were not permitted to deliver babies.

The state-operated clinics encouraged mothers to use baby formula instead of breast milk.

When the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, natural births, dieting and other health care trends began to flood in from the west. The Rozhana Centre was among the pioneers in the field and Tsaregradskaya often appeared on television to promote the benefits of breast feeding and natural birth.
