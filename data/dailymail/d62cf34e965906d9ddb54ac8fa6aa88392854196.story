Denied help: Bernadette Cini was infected with a flesh eating bug following a breast operation

When Bernadette Cini decided to have a breast reduction after years of deliberation, she opted for a surgeon at the Harley Medical Group –  a prestigious, reputable firm. Or so she thought.

Her G-cup breasts caused significant back pain and she may have qualified for NHS treatment but chose to go private for this highly complex operation.

‘I wanted the best possible result,’ says the 62-year-old.

‘The surgeon Hicham Mouallem assured me he used a technique that minimised scarring and retained sensitivity to the nipples, which could be lost. So I decided to go ahead.’

It was a decision she would bitterly regret. In the days after her £5,700 surgery in 2006, the mother of two from Croydon, Surrey, developed a rampant infection in her breasts.

It was ‘flesh-eating’ necrosis, caused by pseudomonas, bacteria normally found in soil.

Over the course of a year, she had five operations to cut away diseased tissue and repair her breasts.

The constant agony she was in meant Bernadette was unable to go on working as a nanny and eventually had to give up her job completely.

‘Everything became a horrible blur of hospitals, operations and pain,’ she recalls.

But when Bernadette sought compensation, Harley Medical Group claimed they were only ‘agents’ so not responsible, and that the surgeon had returned to Italy.

Mouallem was a ‘Fifo’ – a ‘fly in, fly out’ foreign surgeon – and had no insurance in the UK. Although all doctors treating patients in Britain must be registered by law with the GMC, they do not have to have insurance in this country. 

There are no official figures on the number of Fifos operating in the UK, but the last estimate, from a report by the then Healthcare Commission in 2005, stated that two-thirds of surgeons may be from abroad. If they are uninsured, patients who suffer horrific complications struggle to obtain compensation.

It took Bernadette months to track down Mouallem and two years to build a case against him. He admitted he had not warned Bernadette of her heightened risk of infection, due to her weight, and agreed to pay her £20,000 in an out-of-court settlement, barely enough to cover her lost earnings.

Recalling the initial operation at the 
Highgate Hospital, Bernadette says she first noticed something was not 
quite right when she woke up after surgery. A drain inserted into her 
newly-reduced left  breast to remove excess fluid was not working.

High risk: Ms Cini's surgeon was a 'fly-in, fly-out' foreign surgeon, who was allowed to practice in the UK but under law is not required to have insurance in Britain

Mouallem checked Bernadette that evening. She recalls: ‘He just squeezed the suction bag adding, “It’s OK,” and then left.

‘The next day when he returned and saw the drain was still not working he squeezed my breast with his hand, until fluid seemed to move into the drain.’ The next day, a different doctor discharged Bernadette and she went home.

She continues: ‘At first I put my discomfort down to the fact I’d had surgery. Two days later, though, my breast was feeling really tight and painful. I returned to the clinic, where I already had an appointment for a routine dressing change. By the time I went in, my breast felt like it was going to burst and was clearly very infected.

‘The nurse told us she had never seen anything like it before and that I needed to see the surgeon.

‘When he saw it, he started to try to syringe it while pushing down on the breast with the other hand. I was in agony.

‘He didn’t have gloves on and kept telling the nurse “get her to turn away” and “keep her quiet”, because I was screaming.’

A new dressing was applied and she was sent home.

A couple of days later she was again in pain and feeling extremely weak. When her partner contacted the clinic, Bernadette was amazed to discover Mouallem was no longer in the UK.

She was sent to see another Harley Medical Group surgeon, who delivered the devastating news that she had a severe infection and arranged for re-admission to the Highgate.

Bernadette was given antibiotics but the bug spread into the other breast. ‘It was horrifying. There was so much discharge that it would weep through a new dressing and eventually I had to re-do the dressing myself.’

For the next six weeks she was in and out of the hospital but nothing stopped the infection. It was only after she demanded a meeting with the hospital director that she was referred to another specialist, Charles Nduka.

‘He was brilliant, but he had to cut a huge amount of tissue out in order to stop the infection. I’m lucky that I still look relatively normal, with a small scar underneath both breasts.

‘I had hoped that having a breast reduction would allow me to start doing more exercise and get slim. But being so ill and immobile led me to put on weight. Mouallem treated me like something on a conveyor belt.’

Mouallem, who now claims to have UK insurance, said earlier this year: ‘She was a fat lady. She had an infection, it was from the hospital, not from me. The blame gets put on me because it is easier for the company. It wasn’t like she was dying, it was an infection. It can happen with any surgery.’
