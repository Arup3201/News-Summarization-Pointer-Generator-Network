The Fort Hood gunman opened fire after he tried to pick up a form to request time off but was told to come back to the office later, according the father of one of his victims.

Ivan Lopez, who was 
battling mental illness, shot dead three people and wounded 
16 others with a recently purchased pistol before turning the gun on 
himself at Fort Hood on Wednesday.

The father of Army Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook, who works in the personnel office at the base and who was hit by four bullets, said that the violent rampage was sparked by a verbal altercation in the office.

He said his son said that the gunman had gone to collect a leave form but was told to return the next day. He then left, returned with a gun and opened fire, Theodis Westbrook told WLBT.

Gunman: Army Spc. Ivan Lopez killed three people and wounded 16 others in a shooting at Fort Hood on Wednesday before killing himself. It followed a verbal altercation at a personnel office

'The first guy he shot right in front of my son was killed, and then he turned the gun towards Jonathan, aimed it and fired,' he said. 'I don’t know how many times he fired, but he hit my son four times.'

The military has released few details about what motivated the shooting rampage, but at a press conference on Friday, the Fort Hood commander said they believe an argument was a 'direct precipitating factor' before the shooting.

Lopez's family suggested in a statement that his mental state could have been affected by his transfer from another base, as well as the recent deaths of his mother and grandfather.

'My son must not have been in his right mind,' said Ivan Lopez Sr. in a statement published on NBC News. 'My son wasn't like that.'

The three people killed in a shooting rampage were all male soldiers in their 30s. A memorial is being held for the murdered and injured soldiers next Wednesday.

'Motive': Theodis Westbrook said his son, who was shot, said Lopez had tried to pick up a leave form but was told to return another time. He left, grabbed and gun and then opened fire in the office

Recovering: His son Jonathan Westbrook was shot four times in Wednesday's deadly incident

Among
 the victims was Army Sergeant Timothy Owens, 37, a recently married 
native of Effingham, Illinois, who was shot in the chest at close range,
 his mother-in-law told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Sgt.
 First Class Danny Ferguson, 39, from Florida, had just returned from 
Afghanistan and died while trying to barricade a door to keep the 
shooter away, his fiancée and fellow soldier Kristen Haley told Tampa 
broadcaster WTSP-TV. She was nearby when the shooting started.

'He held that door shut because it wouldn't lock. It seems the doors would be bullet proof, but apparently they're not,' Haley told News 10. 'If he wasn't the one standing there holding those doors closed, that shooter would have been able to get through and shoot everyone else.'

The third fatality was Carlos Lazaney, 38, of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, the city's mayor told NBC News on Friday.

The suspected shooter Lopez enlisted in 2008 and had served two tours of duty abroad, including four months in Iraq in 2011, military officials said. He had no direct involvement in combat and had not been wounded.

There was a strong possibility a 
verbal altercation with another soldier or soldiers preceded the 
shooting, Lieutenant General Mark Milley told reporters on Thursday, 
adding there was no indication that he targeted specific people.

The Lopez family, who live in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, said in a statement that it is 'dismayed' by the tragic events.

'This is a very painful situation,' the father of Ivan Lopez said in the statement. 'I ask for prayers for the affected families.'

'My son could not have been in sound mind. He was not that way,' he said.

The rampage is the third shooting at a military base in the United States in about six months that, along with a series of shootings in public places, such as schools and malls, has intensified a national debate over gun violence.

It has also raised questions about 
security at U.S. military installations, such as Fort Hood, home to some
 45,000 soldiers and airmen assigned to the 335-square-mile 
(870-square-km) base, along with thousands of civilian employees.

'Obviously we have a gap. Anytime we 
lose an individual, something's gone wrong,' U.S. Defense Secretary 
Chuck Hagel told reporters in Hawaii on Thursday.

Military officials have so far ruled out terrorism as the reason for the attack.

Lopez had been treated for depression and anxiety. He was being evaluated to see if he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, military officials said.

The shooting sent shockwaves through the Central Texas community in Killeen, where the base is located, that is still reeling from a 2009 attack in which a former Army psychiatrist, Major Nidal Hasan, shot dead 13 people and wounded 32 others.

Lopez, originally from Puerto Rico, had 
recently bought the gun he used, a Smith & Wesson .45-caliber 
pistol, at Guns Galore, the same store in Killeen where Hasan purchased 
the weapon he used in his shooting spree.

All of the wounded shooting victims were showing signs of improvement, Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple said. Five soldiers are still in hospital.

'The three patients previously listed in critical condition have been upgraded to fair condition and are expected to remain in the hospital for the next several days,' it said in a statement on Friday.

Five patients have been discharged, with one patient staying on through Friday for tests.
