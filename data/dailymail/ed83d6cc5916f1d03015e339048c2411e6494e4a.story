Five young children have been found living among piles of rubbish,  rat nests, cigarette butts and mouldy food in a house from hell.

The children were discovered living with their parents when the owner of the rental property at Childers, north of Brisbane, kicked the family out last week.

Viv Jocumsen was carrying out his first inspection of the McIlwraith Street property in eight months when he saw the children living amongst the squalor.

The McIlwraith Street property was littered with rubbish, mouldy food and rat nests

'One of the kids was trying to get around all of this mess,' Mr Jocumsen told the Northern Star.

'It breaks your heart seeing kids like that. They shouldn't have to live like that.'

He expects the clean up bill for the house to exceed $30,000.

The stench wafting from the house could be smelt from the street as piles of rubbish littered the house and mould plagued the walls.

Remains of books strewn across the floor and in drawers had been used by rats to build their nests. 

The children's bathroom had leftover cereal in the sink and a mud-stained bath full of cigarette butts.

The laundry looked like it hadn't been touched in months with dried mud and cigarette butts filling the sink

Mr Jocumsen, who has owned the property for eight years, said he notified the tenants he would be inspecting and they assured him there was nothing to worry about. 

'They said it was immaculate but I told them I'd be there. When I arrived they were cleaning up but it was horrible,' he said. 

'When I opened the front door it was black.'

Child Safety Services were not contacted about the children being forced to live in such squalor. 

Viv Jocumsen said he was left heartbroken after seeing the children trying to manoeuvre around rubbish 

Books and shoes were found strewn across the living area  and rats had formed nests throughout the house

Old bikes and electronics were found dumped underneath the family home

A child's slide was found next to an empty bed in a carpet-stained room

Neighbours say they reguarly put up with loud music, screaming and the foul stench. 

But Childers Police's Sergeant Geoff Fay said no one reported any incidents to police, which meant they had no way of knowing. 

It comes after an Adelaide mother faced court this week accused of endangering her four-year-old boy's life after he was found by police weighing just 8.3kg in a house strewn with rubbish.

In a separate case, a father in Melbourne stands accused of letting his five-year-old boy died after cutting his foot on a can of Tuna at their home in 2012.

He faced court this week after letting his two children live among rotting and spoilt food, mould, faeces and broken furniture.

The boy's mother died last month before she could face trial over his death.  

The family left all kinds of discarded items in the garage when they were kicked out last week
