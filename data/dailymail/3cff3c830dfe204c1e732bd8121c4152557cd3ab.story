A former US Army reservist has pleaded no contest to stealing the identities of his fellow soldiers while he was stationed in Afghanistan.

Los Angeles County prosecutors say Gustavo Cervantes, 24, of Pomona and his cousin pleaded no contest Tuesday to grand theft and identity theft.

Cervantes was sentenced in Los Angeles to three years and eight months in prison and Rigoberto Cortez, 30, got seven years.

Heartless thieves: Ex-Army reservist Gustavo Cervantes (left), 24, and his cousin, Rigoberto Cortez (right), 30, pleaded no contest to grand theft and identity theft in a scam targeting Cervantes' comrades 

The cousins also were ordered to pay more than $200,000 in restitution.

Prosecutors say that during a 10-month period beginning in January 2013, Cervantes stole ID information on seven fellow soldiers he had met while stationed in Kandahar Province.

Cervantes then allegedly forwarded the information to Cortez in Pomona, who established lines of credit and credit card accounts. 

Cervantes allegedly used the misbegotten credit cards to buy luxury cars, furniture, kitchen appliances and TVs.

Ten financial institutions lost a total of about $217,000 as a result of the defendant's scam, according to the District Attorney’s Office. 

Captain Shaun Mathers, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, told NBC Miami that all the victims of the scam were soldiers from Cervantes' own platoon.

'Here these people are defending our country and then being victimized by one of their fellow soldiers,' he told the station.
