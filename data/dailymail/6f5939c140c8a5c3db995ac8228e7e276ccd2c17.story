If you're planning a city break to London this autumn, you may want to avoid Soho.

The trendy central London district - famed for its bustling nightlife and even a seedier strip club element - is the most expensive place to stay for tourists, according to new statistics. 

The survey compared 20 different London neighbourhoods and their cost of lodging - specifically, the price a visitor will have to spend to stay in the cheapest available double room during the  month of October. 

According to recent findings by CheapRooms.co.uk, Soho is the most expensive district to stay in

The average cost for a three-star hotel's double room is a whopping £219 per night

Soho Square - one of the area's famous landmarks - is close to Greek Street's many top restaurants and bars

Designer department store Liberty London can also be found in the Soho neighbourhood

To be considered, hotels must be rated at least three stars and have achieved a positive average client rating.

In the Soho neighbourhood, which is bounded by shopping meccas Oxford Street and Regent Street, as well as Charing Cross Road and Shaftesbury Avenue, guests will pay an average of £219 per night for the cheapest double room.

1. Soho - £219.2

2. Knightsbridge - £216.3

3. Mayfair - £214.4

4. Chelsea - £194.5

5. Belgravia - £172.6

6. The City - £154.7

7. Westminster - £151.8

8. Notting Hill - £150.9

9. Southbank/Waterloo - £147

10. Marylebone - £145 

The Soho area also includes such tourist attractions as Piccadilly Circus, Carnaby Street, the West End, and luxury department store Liberty London.

Knightsbridge and Mayfair came second and third for expensive nightly hotel rates, averaging £216 and £214 respectively.

For those looking for bargain accommodations, however, look no further than Paddington - recently found to be the least expensive area in central London.

With an average of just £100 per night, thrifty travellers will be able to find a decent hotel room.

And for those tight-budget travellers  who don't mind staying a bit further out of the city's centre, the Heathrow Airport area - easily connected to central London via the Piccadilly line - offers double rooms for around £60.

Bordered by Oxford Street to the north and Shaftesbury Avenue to the south, Soho has many charming pubs

For a cheaper hotel, look to Paddington in the city centre or venture outside of London to Heathrow Airport

Regent Street is one of London's most expensive shopping streets - and acts as Soho's western-most border
