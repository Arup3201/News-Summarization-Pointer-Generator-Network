Planes powered by cow flatulence, luggage that floats on air and planes that harness passenger body heat could all one day be a possibility - if the engineers of tomorrow get their way. 

These are some of the shortlisted entries of the global Airbus' Fly Your Ideas competition - created to find eco-efficient ways that aviators can develop their fleets of planes in the future.

Each team will now present its ideas to a panel of Airbus judges in Toulouse for a chance of winning £25,500 (€30,000).

The body heat powering cabins idea was submitted by Team Embarker from Malaysia as part of the Airbus Fly Your Ideas competition. The team said that heat-sensitive material in cabin seats could be used to capture and store the energy from passengers. This energy could then be used to power the onboard electronics and reduce how much energy flights use

The shortlisted entry from Team Levar in Brasil was floating luggage.

Using the principles of air hockey tables, the Brasillian entry involved retro-fitting a plane's cargo hold with 
'super-light sliding sections'.

The sections would blow air that would make the cargo and luggage hover slightly off the ground.

This would help airport workers to quickly, easily and 
safely load and unload luggage. 

Team Levar claim the technology could help passengers get their bags 30 per cent faster.

The technology could also be fitted to the inside of planes to reduce the weight caused by the luggage in the hold, which in turn could reduce the amount of fuel used.

Planes powered by cows, or more specifically, cow flatulence was submitted by Team CLiMA from Australia.

The plans would create a sustainable fuel that puts liquefied methane gas into 
'specially-created supercooled pods' that sit next to the engines.

The team claim this solution could reduce CO2 emissions by 97 per cent.

Team Avas from India put forwarded the idea of a shape-shifting engine that would help reduce noise.

The materials move and change shape when an electric current is applied to them.

The team explained that the plans would involve 'a simple engine modification made from special shape-shifting materials
can change airflow through the engine'.

In a short-haul flight, this solution could save up to 60 per cent of fuel, which reduces up to 40 per cent of CO2 emissions.Human body heat powering cabins – Team Embarker from MalaysiaEven a resting human body can be efficient – heat energy from specially-embedded heat-sensitive material in cabin seats captures energy from passengers. This energy could be used for onboard electronics, reducing the energy requirements for the flight.

By changing the airflow, the amount of noise created by plane engines could be reduced.

The battery-powered hybrid engines, 
from Italian Team Flybrid, would use rechargeable batteries  fitted to the cargo hold.

They would help the engine run on a mix of battery power and fuel and make the planes more power efficient.

The team claim that only the required number of 
batteries would be loaded into the hold, dependent on mileage and this would 'optimise the plane’s 
weight.'

According to Team Flybrid, during a short-haul flight, its solution could save up to 60 per cent of fuel.

This could also reduce up to 40 per cent of CO2 emissions.

Finally, the human body heat powering cabins were submitted by Team Embarker from Malaysia.

Team AVAS from India submitted the idea for quieter engines. Their plans involve making modifications to engines by adding shape-shifting materials. They could change the direction of airflow and make the engines more efficient and less noisy

The shape-shifting materials that Team AVAS want to put into plane engines can move and change shape when an electric current is passed through them. These materials could them change the airflow within the engines and reduce the amount of noise they make

The team explained that even a resting human body can be efficient and heat energy from 
specially-embedded heat-sensitive material in cabin seats could store this 
energy from passengers.

This energy could then be used for onboard electronics, reducing how much energy the flights would use.

Each team will now travel to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse to compete 
for the £25,500 prize and present their ideas to a panel 
of judges. 

They were each assigned an Airbus mentor to support their projects as well as an Airbus expert in their chosen field.

The competition was backed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).

Charles Champion, Executive Vice 
President Engineering at Airbus and Fly Your Ideas Patron, said: 'These 
future-focused and disruptive concepts prove that engineering isn’t just
about technical skills – it’s about having an innovative mindset and a 
creative approach.

Team CliMA from Australia put forward the idea of planes being powered by methane gas. The pods shown in green on the left-hand image, and purple on the close-up, right-hand image would be fitted next to each engine. The pods would be temperature controlled to keep them cool and could turn liquefied methane into engine fuel

'But 
for our industry to succeed in making aviation carbon neutral by 2020, 
we need a constant source of fresh and inventive ideas from the 
innovators of today and those of tomorrow.

'Our
future solutions are here right now – and through projects like Fly 
Your Ideas, we are helping them to become a reality for the future.'

He continued that such innovation may also be under threat from a skills gap that could be hitting the economy hard.

Team Flybrid from Italy suggested putting rechargeable batteries, pictured in green underneath the front and back of the plane, into a plane's cargo hold to create power-efficient hybrid engines. The team claim that only the required number of batteries would be loaded to a planed dependent on mileage, optimising the plane's weight

Companies face a shortfall of 40 
million of the skilled workers needed by 2020 and beyond, with aerospace
likely to suffer, along with motor and the medical equipment sectors.

Dr Lidia Brito, Director of the Division of Science Policy and Capacity Building at UNESCO, said:

'If
we can’t find ways to inspire a generation of engineers with varied 
skills, this is going to be a principle obstacle for growth in our 
slowly recovering global economy.

'A recent UNESCO Engineering Report shows a marked shortage of engineers in many countries.

An artist's impression shows what Team Flybrid's rechargeable batteries may look like being fitted to an Airbus plane. The Italian engineers behind the idea claim the technology could save up to 60% of fuel during a short-haul flight, which reduces up to 40% of CO2 emissions

'Although the general number of engineering students is increasing worldwide, the proportion who enroll in engineering, as compared to other disciplines, is concernedly dropping.

'We need hands-on challenges like Fly Your Ideas to motivate young innovators about the potential of engineering in helping to find practical solutions to issues the world may face in the near future.'

Fly Your Ideas is part of The Future by Airbus, the company’s vision of sustainable air travel in 2050.

The winning team will be announced at an award ceremony in Paris on 14th June.
