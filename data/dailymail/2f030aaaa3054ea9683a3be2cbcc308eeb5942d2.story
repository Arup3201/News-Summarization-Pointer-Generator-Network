Manchester United are still exploring ways of bringing in Real Madrid's wantaway winger Angel Di Maria and his club-mate Sami Khedira.

In more positive news for United fans, executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is bullish about bringing in two more players before the transfer window closes. 

Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Thursday that both Di Maria and Khedira could leave. Di Maria has been target for United boss Louis van Gaal all summer while he knows Khedira from his time in Germany.

Open offer: Carlo Ancelotti says ‘if Di Maria doesn’t find a solution for his future, we would welcome him back'

Ancelotti said: ‘If Di Maria doesn’t find a solution for his future, we would happily welcome him back once the transfer market is over. 

‘He asked to leave, he didn’t accept the proposal for the renewal of the contract. He’s a Real Madrid player and until August 31, as I’ve already said, anything can happen.

‘Khedira is a different situation. He’s not asked to go. He’s rejected an offer to renew, but has a year of contract. We’ll see what happens.’

These signings could appease United fans, who are growing angry with what they view as their club’s lacklustre approach to signing players and one faction is planning a demonstration at the home game with QPR next month. 

There is better news on the pitch as they will have striker Robin van Persie back in their squad for their Barclays Premier League game at Sunderland on Sunday after he returned to first-team training on Thursday.

Van Persie has not played for new manager Van Gaal yet after being given extra time to get fit in the wake of his journey to the last four of the World Cup in July.

But after training the striker revealed he is ready to play.  

‘Good training session done this morning,’ he said on Twitter. ‘Looking forward to Sunday.’

Van Persie was overlooked for the United captaincy by Van Gaal, even though the two men are close and the 31-year-old was his manager’s skipper during the World Cup.

However, Van Persie is crucial to United’s hopes of success this season and if he thinks he is fit enough Van Gaal will team him up with captain Wayne Rooney against Sunderland.

Van Gaal will hand a debut to defender Marcos Rojo on Sunday.The 24-year-old trained with his new team-mates on Thursday and is expected to play on the left of Van Gaal’s defensive three.

‘It is an honour for me to now say that I play for Manchester United,’ said Rojo on Thursday night. ‘I am young and am very keen to continue to learn the game, so playing for such an experienced technical coach as Louis van Gaal is a fantastic opportunity for me. I have joined United to work hard with my team-mates to win trophies and I know the manager shares that ambition.’

United were missing nine players when they lost to Swansea at Old Trafford last Saturday. On Thursday they welcomed Jonny Evans and Antonio Valencia back to training, who should help to ease the defensive burden this weekend.

Further tests on Marouane Fellaini’s ankle have revealed no real ligament damage, so United hope to move the Belgian on this month.

Meanwhile, Sunderland keeper Vito Mannone, the penalty shootout hero as the Black Cats beat United to reach the Capital One Cup final last January, is out to heap more misery on Van Gaal.

Mannone said: ‘I believe we can win. In the Premier League I don’t think the difference is that massive. We need to play our game and get a result again.’
