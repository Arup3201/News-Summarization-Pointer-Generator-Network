Drivers should always obey the Highway Code - although in this situation, it's impossible.

Bizarre new road markings on a junction in Stamford Hill, north London, are leaving motorists with a headache by appearing to direct them straight into a traffic island.

A further new marking ahead of that - spotted by Paul Wood, 50, of Harlow, Essex, when he was driving in the area yesterday - appears to give drivers the option of turning into oncoming traffic.

Where to go? Bizarre new road makings on a junction in Stamford Hill, north London, are leaving drivers with a headache by appearing to direct them straight into a traffic island

Mr Wood spotted a sign saying ‘New Road Layout’ ahead of the strange markings on the junction between Seven Sisters Road and Amhurst Park.

The first arrow gives the option of turning left - which is in line with the traffic flow - or straight on, into a traffic island. The second marking beyond the island allows drivers to turn into oncoming traffic.

Mr Wood said: ‘Where the road is after you would bear left, if you look to the right of that there is a traffic cone, then there is another sign telling you to turn left - into oncoming traffic.’

The photographer, who grew up in the area, added: ‘I almost followed the broken lines - it was a case of “what's happened here”? So I did a double take and carried on where I should be going.’

'These temporary road markings, which were in place while essential bridge waterproofing was carried out, should have been removed on completion of the works'

Dana Skelley, Transport for London

Dana Skelley, director of roads at Transport for London, revealed that the road markings were only temporary and left on in error.

She told MailOnline: 'These temporary road markings, which were in place while essential bridge waterproofing was carried out, should have been removed on completion of the works.

'They will be removed and replaced by our highway contractor this evening and we apologise for any confusion caused by this mistake.'
