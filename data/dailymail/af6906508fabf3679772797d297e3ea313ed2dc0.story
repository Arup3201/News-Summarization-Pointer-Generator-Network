 

Gareth Bale should be given a free role for Wales in their huge Euro 2016 qualifying match in Israel as Sam Vokes has been called up by Chris Coleman for the first time since his serious knee injury.

The Burnley striker ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in March 2014 and did not play again until Boxing Day – but has emerged unscathed in recent months and played a significant role in the victory over Manchester City.

Vokes last appeared for Wales in the friendly with Iceland 12 months ago – scoring in the 3-1 win – and Bale has been utilised as a striker in his absence.

The Real Madrid star is likely to be afforded an opportunity to roam though, should Coleman select Vokes as his centre-forward for the clash in Haifa between Group B’s top two sides.

Liverpool’s Joe Allen and Arsenal’s Aaron Ramsey are in the squad, alongside captain Ashley Williams.
