Experts claim that while an SPF cream (stock image) can stop the short-term effects of sunbathing, it allows enough rays through to cause potentially fatal disease in the long term

Wearing sun cream is not a reliable way to prevent getting skin
cancer, scientists have warned.

A groundbreaking study into the way UV radiation attacks the
skin has revealed that long-lasting damage is not stopped by sunscreen.

While an SPF cream can stop sunburn and the short-term
effects of sunbathing, it allows enough rays through to cause potentially fatal
disease in the long term.

Anyone who spends more than a short time in the sun should
make sure they are covered up and should not rely on sunscreen alone, experts
warned.

Scientists at Manchester University and London’s Institute
of Cancer Research carried out the world’s first molecular study into the way
malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is caused.

Their paper, published in the journal
Nature, revealed that even highest grade SPF 50 suncream allows sufficient UV
radiation through to damage the DNA in the skin’s pigment cells.

Dr Julie Sharp, of Cancer Research UK, which funded the
study, said: ‘People tend to think they’re invincible once they’ve put it on
and end up spending longer out in the sun, increasing their overall exposure to
UV rays.

‘This research adds important evidence showing that
sunscreen has a role, but that you shouldn’t just rely on this to protect your
skin.’

Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK,
with more than 13,000 people diagnosed with the disease every year.

The scientists found that sunscreen could not stop solar
radiation causing a mutation in the skin’s ‘guardian gene’ which produces
proteins that protect against UV.

The researchers insisted people should continue to wear sunscreen, because while it does not provide complete protection, it can slow the cancer-causing effect of UV. But they said nobody should rely on sunscreen alone. Instead, people should also cover up when spending time in the sun (stock image)

With the gene damaged, the skin is vulnerable to further
damage from the sun and more likely to develop a tumour.

Study author Richard Marais, of Manchester University, said:
‘UV light targets the very genes protecting us from its own damaging effects,
showing how dangerous this cancer-causing agent is. 

‘Very importantly, this study provides proof that sunscreen
does not offer complete protection from the damaging effects of UV light.’

The research team examined the molecular effects of UV light
on the skin of 110 mice which had been genetically altered to be susceptible to
melanoma.

They found that the use of SPF 50 sun cream would delay the
formation of tumours, but could not stop it altogether.

Over a 15-month period they exposed the mice to weekly dose
of UV radiation similar to that a person would be receive to if they spent an
hour a week in a garden in southern England.

The mice which did not have any protection each developed
tumours after an average of 5.3 months, and within seven months every single
one had the cancer.

Another group of mice had their fur shaved and SPF50
sunscreen applied. These mice developed tumours after an average of 7.5 months,
and each had grown melanoma within 15 months.

Professor Marais insisted people should continue to wear
sunscreen, because while it does not provide complete protection, it can slow
the cancer-causing effect of UV.

But he said nobody should rely on sunscreen alone to protect
them from skin cancer.

He said: ‘This work highlights the importance of combining
sunscreen with other strategies to protect our skin, including wearing hats and
loose fitting clothing, and seeking shade when the sun is at its strongest.’

Professor Marais said the crucial finding is the impact of a
‘guardian gene’ called P53, which normally helps protect from the effects of
damage caused by UV light.

He said: ‘We found that sunscreen does work by limiting the
immediate effect of UV on the skin - it stops sunburn.

‘But sunscreen does not protect the skin completely - enough
UV light sneaks past to cause long term damage to the DNA.

‘The important thing is the impact on the P53 gene, which is
the guardian of the genome. Usually when you go out into the sun P53 activates the
release of protein which protects against UV.

‘But solar radiation knocks out the guardian, it targets the
very thing that defends the skin, and sunscreen cannot protect against that.’

The cosmetics industry insisted it had never
claimed sun cream could stop cancer.

Dr Chris Flower, director general of the Cosmetic, Toiletry
and Perfumery Association, said: ‘As cosmetic producers we never talk about
cancer in relation to the product - we cannot talk about protecting against or
stopping disease.

‘We never recommend that sun care products should be used to
stay out in the sun longer, only as part of ‘sun safe’ behaviour, which
includes staying out of the sun during the hottest part of the day, and
covering up.

‘We can’t use the term ‘sunblock’ or anything that suggest
there is 100 per cent protection. We can’t say total protection, the strongest
term we can use is ‘very high’ protection.

‘The first line of defence is to avoid sun, the second is to
cover up with a sunhat, T-shirt and trousers, and the third line of defence is
to use a sunscreen.’
