A woman was found naked and raped in the back of a car after celebrating the first anniversary of her relationship with cocaine and champagne, a court has heard.

The Welsh victim and her boyfriend had booked into a top hotel in London and visited a series of bars during the night out.

They snorted cocaine and visited a champagne bar in Covent Garden - drinking three or four glasses each.

However, they separated at midnight after a row, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

The next thing the woman could remember was waking up at Limehouse police station in east London.

She later discovered police had found her naked in the back of a car with Michael Wilson and Ahmed Qaras.

Wilson, 31, had his trousers pulled down and his genitals exposed as he climbed out of the vehicle, the jury heard.

Jennifer Knight, prosecuting, said: 
‘The victim and her boyfriend had come to London from Wales and 
carefully planned their evening to celebrate their first anniversary.

‘They went to a champagne bar in Covent Garden where they had three or four glasses of champagne each.

‘They returned to their hotel room and shared Jack Daniels and Baileys, and did a couple of lines of cocaine each.'

The couple then visited Shoreditch - where the woman is believed to have drank more Jack Daniels, a cocktail and shots of Sambuca - before separating after a 'disagreement', the court heard.

Police recovered CCTV footage which showed the woman being followed by Wilson and Qaras, 26, on Leytonstone High Street at 1.13am.

The two men were stopped after driving 'erractically' in Stepney at 1.55am - and were allegedly found trying to swap places in the car.

Ms Knight said: 'When police got Wilson out of the car, his trousers were down and his genitals exposed.

‘In the back was the victim, completely naked and incoherent - she was unaware of where she was, who she was with and why she was naked.’

Wilson, from Plaistow, Newham, has denied rape, while Qaras, from Forest Gate, has pleaded not guilty to a single count of aiding or abetting the rape of a woman.

In an interview with police, Wilson claimed he had sex with the woman, but she had consented and removed her own clothes.

Qaras told officers he had parked the car and got out - unaware of what Wilson and the woman had done.

Despite sobering up the next day, the victim still could not remember anything about the incident. 

Ms Knight added: ‘It must have been abundantly apparent to the defendants that they were taking advantage of a very drunk woman.’

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
