Lord Coe will not become the next chairman of the BBC Trust, despite being the Government’s preferred candidate.

The former Olympics boss has decided to withdraw his candidacy before the interview stage, so that he can bid to become president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) next year.

He was once described as ‘a virtual shoo-in’ for the top job, according to the BBC’s economics editor Robert Peston.

Lord Coe was also the preferred 
candidate of David Cameron, but it is now believed the Prime Minister is
 hoping for a woman to succeed Lord Patten.

The former Conservative MP has instead
 decided to concentrate his efforts on succeeding Lamine Diack as 
president of the IAAF in August 2015.

Lord Coe, speaking to the Mail’s 
Sports Agenda column, said: ‘I did allow my name to go forward to give 
myself time to properly analyse whether I had enough time to do the job 
to the best of my abilities.

‘On reflection, I haven’t the capacity
 and I now want to concentrate on my current  commitments and the IAAF 
election. As everyone knows, athletics is in my DNA.’

Lord Coe, who is currently at the 
Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, was first rumoured to be in line for the 
£110,000-a-year part-time role in May, when Lord Patten stood down after
 heart surgery.

At the time, London Mayor Boris Johnson said Lord Coe 
would be a ‘first-rate choice’.

Possibility: One of the new favourites for the top BBC job is Dame Marjorie Scardino (pictured), former chief executive of publisher Pearson and Twitter's first female board member

One of the new favourites for the top 
BBC job is Dame Marjorie Scardino, former chief executive of publisher 
Pearson and Twitter’s first female board member.

Lady Wheatcroft, the Conservative peer
 and Lady Hogg, a crossbencher and former BBC governor, have also been 
mooted as candidates.

If either are chosen, it would be the first time a
 woman has headed the trust.

Chairman of the English National Opera Martyn Rose is also a possible candidate.

Interviews will be conducted by a 
panel including the Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, the former BBC 
and ITV executive Carolyn Fairbairn and the independent peer Lord 
Kakkar.

The current acting chairman, Diane Coyle, applied for the position but is believed to be out of the running.

Lord Coe is one of three vice 
presidents of the IAAF along with his rival for the presidency, 
Ukraine’s Sergei Bubka, whose bid may suffer due to the turmoil in his 
country.
