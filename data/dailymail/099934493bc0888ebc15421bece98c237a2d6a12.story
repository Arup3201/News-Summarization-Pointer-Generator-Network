A Belgian artist is petitioning a court to rule whether the former king is her father. 

Delphine Boel, 46, claims that King Albert II had an affair with her mother Sybille de Selys Longchamps and she was the product of that regal encounter. 

Her lawyer Alain De Jonge said that his client is not motivated by money as she is a member of a major Belgian industrial family worth $1 billion.

Former Belgian king Albert II, left, denies he is Delphine Boel's father although he is not expected in court 

He told Belgian newspaper De Morgan: 'If the royal family got in a plane together and had an accident or, as in Nepal, were killed by a mad man, then she could be queen. But her ambitions do not stretch that far. It is more about the ending of a stigma.

'She is hoping no longer to be branded as the likely illegitimate daughter, but wishes to be recognised as a child.

The court case is being conducted behind closed doors as is normal for Belgian family law. A lawyer for the former king said they were optimistic. 

If successful, Boel would be 15th in line for the Belgian throne.  

De Jonge has said that the court would initially examine whether her legal father, Jacques Boel, is a biological parent and that a recently conducted paternity test showed he was not.

Media have reported that Boel has disinherited his daughter because of the shame the scandal had brought to his family.

Under Belgian law a man cannot be forced to take a paternity test, but a judge could take his refusal to do so into account.

Boel's case came to light in 1999 with the publication of a biography of Queen Paolo, Albert's Italian wife. It said Albert had formed an extra-marital relationship resulting in the birth of a daughter in the 1960s, when his brother Baudouin was king.

He has never commented on the possible existence of such a daughter but did refer in his 1999 Christmas message to a crisis in his marriage 30 years earlier, the time of Boel's birth.

If the court declares that King Albert is her father, Delphine Boel will be 14th in line to the Belgian throne 

The court case in Brussels is being held behind closed doors as are all family law cases in Belgium 

Albert II, 80, abdicated last year, citing health reasons, and was succeeded by his 54-year-old son Philippe.

Boel's mother Sybille de Selys Longchamps, a baroness, has recounted in interviews her time with Albert and her decision to move to London after the end of their relationship. She and Boel divorced in 1978.

She is likely to be a crucial witness in the case. Albert is not expected to appear in person.

Albert's father King Leopold III abdicated, allowing his elder brother King Baudouin take over the throne.

When Baudouin died without an heir, Albert assumed the throne until 2013 when he abdicated in favour of his eldest son, King Phillipe. 

Albert and his wife Queen Paola had three children although this case is seeking to identify Ms Boel as the king's fourth child - placing her 14th in line to the throne. 

The monarchy has been regarded as one of the few things uniting Belgium, a country beset by divisions between a richer Dutch-speaking north and French-speaking south viewed by separatist northerners as welfare-dependent.

However, the royals have faced criticism, especially when it emerged that Queen Fabiola, the widow of Baudouin, had planned to pass on an estate in Spain using a trust to avoid paying tax.

The reports caused the Belgian government to reform the system of allowances and taxation for members of the monarchy.
