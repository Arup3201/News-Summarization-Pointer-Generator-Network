British number one Heather Watson is through to the second round of the Rogers Cup in Montreal after a 6-4 5-7 6-4 win over Tereza Smitkova.

The first set was a topsy-turvy affair but Watson prevailed as she broke her Czech opponent three times.

The 22-year-old was not as clinical in the second as she took just one of four break points and that was enough to let the world number 93 back into the match.

On her way: British number one Heather Watson is through to the second round of the Rogers Cup in Montreal

Tough: Watson beat the Czech Tereza Smitkova in three sets in order to progress in Canada 

But Watson is ranked 36 places above Smitikova and she held her nerve to take the third and advance to a clash against either Francoise Abanda or 10th seed Dominika Cibulkova.
