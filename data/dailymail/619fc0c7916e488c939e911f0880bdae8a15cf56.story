Arsenal are on the trail of Marseille defender Stephane Sparagna and are keen to strike a deal in January.

The 19-year-old centre back can also play in defensive midfield and has been capped by France at Under 20 level.

His first-team career has been hindered by a spate of injuries and Marseille had put contract talks on hold while he got fit.

Marseille French Under 20 defender Stephane Sparagna is a transfer target for Arsenal in January

The 19-year-old defender has yet to sign a new deal at Marseille due to a spate of injury problems

Age: 19

Position: Centre back 

Club: Marseille 

Nation: France Under 20

However, his deal runs out in December and Arsenal have been alerted to a bargain - as have Rennes and Udinese.

Clubs have already made approaches to his agent but Marseille believe he will stay to prove himself with them first before agreeing a move.

The Gunners are also interested in signing Croatian international Marcelo Brozovic from Dinamo Zagreb, according to the mdifielder's agent.

Arsenal could get the young defender at a knock-down price because his contract expires in December
