Married murderers awaiting the death penalty for killing a teenage boy have been granted permission to have sex so their parents can have a grandchild to remember them by.

Jasvir Singh and his wife Sonia filed a petition asking for conjugal visits and the right to have children after they were given the death sentence following a lengthy public trial.

The couple kidnapped the 16-year-old son of a wealthy family and demanded a ransom - but when their scheme started to go wrong, they killed the boy to stop him identifying them.

The bizarre ruling allowing the murderers to have sex was handed down by the Punjab and Haryana High Court - which accepted it was a fundamental human right to have progeny.

When the couple first filed their petition, the court rejected that it was a human right to have sex.

But it accepted that if it was purely for the purposes of having children, whether through conjugal visits or artificial insemination, it should be allowed.

Justice Surya Kant of the high court said that authorities at the Central Jail in Patiala should make arrangements for the couple's wish to be carried out.

Lawyers for Jasvir argued that he is the only son of his parents, and that he and his wife had only been married eight months when they were arrested.

Indian justice officials had originally rejected the plea because of the seriousness of the crime. 

But they overturned the earlier ruling in the broader public interest saying that the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution includes the right of convicts and jail inmates to have conjugal visits or artificial insemination in order to have children.
