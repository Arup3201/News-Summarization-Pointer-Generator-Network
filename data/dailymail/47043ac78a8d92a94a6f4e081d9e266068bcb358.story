Phil Mickelson will miss the FedEx Cup play-offs finale for the first time in his career after withdrawing from the BMW Championship in Denver after the second round.

A six-over-par 76 left Mickelson 14 shots off the lead heading into the weekend and tied for 63rd in the 69-man field.

The five-time major winner would have needed to finish fourth or higher to have any chance of qualifying for next week's Tour Championship.
