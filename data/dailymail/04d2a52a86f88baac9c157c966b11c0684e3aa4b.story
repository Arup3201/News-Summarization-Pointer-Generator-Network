Tomas Rosicky says he can't explain why he's not playing a more prominent role for Arsenal as his side struggle to find the right combinations this season but he insists his age, 34, is not a factor. 

Arsene Wenger's Gunners have won just four of their 11 Premier League matches this campaign and have recently blown leads against Anderlecht in their 3-3 Champions League draw and in an equally dramatic 2-1 loss in Swansea.

Rosicky was a regular for Wenger last season but has found himself out of favour with just one start  - in their Capital One Cup loss to Southampton - among his eight club appearances.

The  Czech Republic veteran says when he does get a run, he's struggles to get in to the game.

'The coach is trying to find a system that best suits the players, and vice versa,' Rosicky said in The Times.

'I'm not in this alone - there are other players in a similar boat. When we do get a chance, it's harder for us to get into our rhythm.

Arsene Wenger is still trying to decide on his best formation, and as yet Rosicky isn't part of it

'So far, this season has been disappointing for us. We haven't played well, and when I've played I've not been at the forefront of things.'

Although being the oldest player in the Gunners squad, with the closest team-mate to his 34 years being Mikel Arteta at 32, Rosicky insists fitness or age shouldn't have a bearing on Wenger's selections.

'I'm not sure what's going on,' he said. 'I understand that I am 34 years old and that it probably plays a role, whether I like it or not. That's without a doubt.

'However, I'm not in physical decline. When I played for the national team against Netherlands, I ran 12 kilometres and according to the tests at Arsenal I'm in the top five in terms of speed.'

His Czech side beat the World Cup semi-finalists 2-1 in that Euro 2016 qualifier on September 9. He also played 90 minutes in their win over Turkey but was kept on the bench for the 4-2 win over Kazakhstan. On Sunday the Czechs face Iceland, who are joint top of Group A with the maximum of nine points from their three games.

'We [Wenger and I] are on good terms, so I do not really know what it is,' Rosicky says of his club place. 'It is purely a coach's decision. It's not my decline. My health is fine too. Of course I want to play, but there's not much I can do about it.'
