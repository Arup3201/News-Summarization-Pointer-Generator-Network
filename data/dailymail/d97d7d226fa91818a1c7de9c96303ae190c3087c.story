Barcelona utility man Javier Mascherano has leapt to the defence of team-mate Lionel Messi, believing criticism of the superstar forward has been excessive.

The 27-year-old believes that Messi has set the bar so high with his remarkably consistent level of performances over the years, meaning too much is expected of him at all times.

He told Tot Sant Cugat: 'Criticism of Messi, on several occasions, has been excessive.

'We are accustomed to unimaginable things, that only he can do, and when he doesn't score a goal it doesn't mean he's not good. It's practically impossible to see him play badly.

'Everything Barca have achieved in recent years has been thanks to players like Messi, [Andres] Iniesta and Xavi,' he told Tot Sant Cugat.

'They have made this team one of the best in history. Messi has given a lot to Barca, and Barca to Messi too.'

The Argentine has already scored six goals for the Catalan giants this season, including a double at home to Granada last weekend, taking his total goal haul for the club over the 400 mark.

Messi and his team-mates will look to bounce back from their midweek Champions League defeat against PSG when they travel to Rayo Vallecano on Saturday night.
