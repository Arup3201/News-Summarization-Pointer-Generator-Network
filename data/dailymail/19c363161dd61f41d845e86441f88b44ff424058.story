Fernandinho has taunted Manchester United ahead of Tuesday's derby by admitting that he couldn't believe how poor the Premier League champions were when the pair played each other in September.

The 28-year-old, who has proven a valuable commodity in the middle of Manuel Pellegrini's midfield since a summer move from Shakhtar Donetsk, claimed he was surprised at the way in which United crumbled.

David Moyes cut a forlorn figure on the Etihad touchline as he watched his team capitulate in a 4-1 defeat that indicated signs of the difficulties United were to face in the months to come.

They lie seventh, 11 points behind the top four, while City are six points behind leaders Chelsea with three games in hand. Fernandinho expects three points at Old Trafford.Â 

Talking about the win against them six months ago, he said: 'United are a club with history, with very good players and they were the champions. So I was surprised at how badly they played, how easily we won.'

City have had to endure serial mocking from their rivals for years; supporters will now be crowing at the way in which the current crop of players hold such low regard for their fallen neighbours.

There have, however, been signs of recovery for United in the last week. Handed the armband against West Ham, Wayne Rooney scored a stunning 58-yard half-volley at the weekend and appeared a freer man without having to accommodate Robin van Persie up front.

That followed the excellent display in the Champions League last-16, overturning a two-goal deficit from the second leg to set up a tie against Bayern Munich.

Fernandinho, however, isn't buying the upsurge.

'The situation is different now, because we're fighting for the title and they're not,' the Brazilian added. 'They're just fighting for honour now. But a derby is the same whichever country you are in - each team wants to win.

'We'll go there expecting to win, but we know in a derby a lot of things can happen. We'll be ready for it and have to play very well because it's a very important game for us.'
