Wealthy property developer Michael Moore moved to Wargrave in Oxfordshire from his home in Surrey last year to spend more time on the water

A wealthy property developer drowned during a family day out on the river only yards from where his wife and daughters were enjoying rowing lessons.

Michael Moore capsized in a kayak in a weir just 300 yards away from his family - including wife Sarah, whom he married just months ago.

The 43-year-old was found floating face-down in the River Thames in Shiplake, South Oxfordshire, after he was dragged under the water for more than 10 minutes.

The businessman had recently left his family's property firm in south London to set up a new company in the countryside and pursue his passion for kayaking before the tragedy happened.

Mr Moore's devastated brother Tony, aged 45 years, said today: 'He loved the river, the surroundings and the people and the family wanted to get totally involved in it.

'We were a really tight family and everyone is in pieces. Michael was so young, fit and full of life. I would give everything to have him back.'

Michael and his wife Sarah, aged 42 years, only tied the knot in February, said Tony.

The couple and their two daughters - Imogen, aged 12 years, and Evie, aged 11 years - all ventured out onto the Thames last Saturday.

Mr Moore had gone down the river in his kayak while his wife and children were having rowing lessons at Wargrave Boating Club.

The father was last seen paddling past an island campsite towards the weir before he vanished. A while later, he was seen floating face-down in the water and was pulled out by two paramedics who were at the campsite on holiday.

They performed CPR in an attempt to resuscitate him before he was rushed to Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, where he was pronounced dead.

Mr Moore had just finished developing his first home since moving his young family from Sutton, Surrey, to a house in Wargrave, Oxfordshire, last year.

His brother Tony said: 'Michael idolised his kids and gave them everything to make sure they had a nice life. He had a plan in his head and achieved everything.

'He was fantastic - always smiling and laughing. Everyone who met him loved him. He always had time for people and was reliable. It sounds cliched, but he couldn't do enough for others. He was the whole package.

'He was the hardest-working person I have ever met and he just loved to get his hands dirty. He was always working on some big project. He had got to the end of his first project but he can't reap the rewards. His dream is over, shattered, just for pursuing a bit of fun.'

The Wargrave Boating Club remained closed as a mark of respect today following the tragedy. Thames Valley Police and the Environment Agency have launched an investigation. 'The circumstances are unclear at present,' an agency spokesman said.
