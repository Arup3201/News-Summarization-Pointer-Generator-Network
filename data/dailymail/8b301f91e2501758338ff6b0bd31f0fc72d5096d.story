A witness told TMZ that a sedan T-boned Newton's pickup truck from the left side. According to reports from the scene, his Dodge Ram flipped over at least three times on the road.

When the pickup truck came to rest on its right side, Newton was able to crawl out the back window and walk over the shoulder of the highway, where he laid down.

According to reports, when paramedics arrived on the scene Newton initially told them he did not want to go to the hospital, but he eventually relented.

Preliminary tests showed that the 25-year-old suffered a pair of traverse process fractures in his lower back, as well as scrapes and bruises.

A fracture of traverse process a is a break of a part of one of the bones in the spine shaped like a wing. 

The driver of the other vehicle was also hospitalized with non life-threatening injuries.

According to latest reports, Newton will remain at Carolinas Medical Center overnight for observation.

Panthers coach Ron Rivera will address Newton's status Wednesday. 

But Newton's injuries likely will keep him out of Sunday's home game against the Buccaneers, team sources told News Observer.

He threw three touchdown passes in Carolina's 41-10 win over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, his best game in nearly a month-and-a-half. He also broke a string of eight straight games with an interception.

The win put the Panthers back in the playoff hunt, one-half game behind the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints (both 5-8).

Newton was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft and was inserted in as the franchise's starter right away. 

He has only missed one game this season, the opener at Tampa Bay, due to a Newton has one year left on his rookie contract after the Panthers picked up a $15million option for 2015.

The Panthers have repeatedly said Newton is a guy they view as their franchise quarterback moving forward.
