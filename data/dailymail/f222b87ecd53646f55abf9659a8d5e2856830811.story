Sharmila Mistry, 42, was accused of causing the deaths of two toddlers when she was distracted by a mobile phone call. She has been found not guilty of causing death by dangerous driving

A mother-of-two who crashed into a car before ploughing into pushchairs carrying two toddlers as she chatted on her mobile phone has been found not guilty of causing death by careless driving.

One-year-old Oliwier Baczyk and two-year-old Zofia Tabaka died after being struck by a BMW being driven by Sharmila Mistry, 42, in August 2012.

A court heard Mistry collided with a red Mini which sent her vehicle into the Polish toddlers who were being pushed along by their fathers near a pedestrian crossing.

The children were rushed to hospital with multiple injuries but Oliwier died hours later while Zofia passed away during the night.

Zofia's father Lukasz Tabaka, 30, and Oliwier's mother's cousin Kamil Kohar, who were with the toddlers, both sustained minor injuries.

Mistry, from Bushby, Leicestershire, went on trial at Leicester Crown Court last week accused of two counts of causing death by careless driving.

And today a jury found her not guilty of the charges after three hours and 18 minutes of deliberation.

Oliwier's mother wept uncontrollably in the public as the verdict was returned.

Instead Mistry was found guilty of two counts of careless driving and banned from the roads for 18 months, as well as ordered to pay a £3,000 fine.

During the trial, the court heard the mother-of-two was involved in a collision with the Mini being driven by Christopher Andrews, 61, who has since died of natural causes, while she was on her way to a business meeting.

Jurors were told Mistry had been talking on her phone's hands-free kit as she travelled at 36mph on the 30mph road in Leicester at 9.50am on August 6, 2012.

Prosecutor James Thomas said Mr Andrews drove his Mini through a red light at the busy junction while accounts manager Mistry drove through an amber light.

He told the jury the impact of the crash sent her car careering across the road before it mounted the kerb, hit a set of traffic lights before smashing into the children's pushchairs.

Nicholas Syfret QC, defending, had told Mistry’s trial the ‘true cause of the tragic accident’ was the Mini driver, who passed away in unrelated circumstances in the weeks following the incident.

After Mistry was acquitted of causing the deaths of the children, he said: 'In my submission, she cannot be held in any way responsible for the collision. That was the fault of the mini. That would have come as a bolt from the blue for anybody.'

Giving evidence during the trial, Mistry, an accounts manager, described the moment her car struck the Mini and careered towards the two toddlers.

She said: 'As soon as I felt impact my airbags deployed.

'They were on my side. They seemed to come from the top in terms of the car door.

'There was one that came from the middle of the car.

'The one to the side came out at me and obscured my windscreen, my top windscreen, and I couldn't see.

'On impact the whole car jolted, I jolted. I felt the car move off course. I wasn't going straight any more.'

She added: 'I immediately pressed the brake in the car. There was smoke in the car or that is what seemed like at the time.

'I didn't know what had hit me. I just knew I had been hit.

'I felt juddering as it (the car) mounted the kerb and I could see two poles from the vision I had from between the air bag and dashboard and then I came to a stop.

'I didn't know what had hit me. My belt locked across my chest. My stomach went tight as well, I was completely in shock.'

The court heard she drove 500 miles a week in her job, and had one previous conviction for speeding in a 40mph zone, for which she undertook a speed awareness course.

After the hearing, Zofia and Oliwier’s family, who wept as the verdicts were announced, were too upset to comment.
