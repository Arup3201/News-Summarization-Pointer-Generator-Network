Google has bought streaming service Songza in a bid to bolster its online music service.

The firm said it will incorporate the service into its own in the coming months in a bid to take on Spotify, Amazon and Beats Music, which was recently bought by Apple.

The firm is believed to be preparing to launch a new YouTube music service as well and ramping up its existing Play All Access subscription music service.

Google is preparing to launch a new YouTube music service as well and ramping up its existing Play All Access subscription music service. now it has bought Songza, which provides playlists curated by experts.

Songza is a free music streaming and recommendation service for Internet users in North America.

Playlists are made by music experts, the service recommends various playlists based on time of day and mood or activity.

Google said it would explore ways to incorporate aspects of Songza into its existing streaming music service over the coming months.

For now the four-year-old Songza service, which creates 'expert-curated' music playlists intended to match users' activities and tastes, will remain unchanged for existing users.

'Today, we’re thrilled to announce that we’re becoming part of Google,' it said in a blog post.

'We can’t think of a better company to join in our quest to provide the perfect soundtrack for everything you do.

'No immediate changes to Songza are planned, other than making it faster, smarter, and even more fun to use.'

Google did not provide financial terms of the deal, though a report in the New York Post earlier this month citing unnamed sources said Google had offered to buy the company for $15 million.

The search giant said: 'Over the coming months, we’ll explore ways to bring what you love about Songza to Google Play Music.

'We'll also look for opportunities to bring their great work to the music experience on YouTube and other Google products.'

The deal comes one month after Apple Inc acquired Beats for $3 billion.

Apple's purchase of Beats, which also touted its expertise curating music playlists, was viewed as an effort to jump-start Apple's position in the fastest-growing segment of the music market.

Sales of digital music downloads have declined in recent months, while streaming services such as Pandora Media Inc and Spotify have become increasingly popular with consumers.

Google launched a $9.99-per-month Play All Access subscription music service in 2013, and the company said last month its YouTube video website was preparing to launch a paid streaming service.

Google would not say how many employees Songza had but it said the company would continue to work from its base in New York.

Google plans to use Songza's technology in its own music-streaming service, as well as its YouTube video site.
