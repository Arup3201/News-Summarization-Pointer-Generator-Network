The father of the two Boston bombing suspects will apparently travel to the U.S. tomorrow in order to seek 'justice and the truth'.

Anzor Tsarnaev says he has 'lots of questions for the police' and is keen 'to clear up many things' when he arrives from his home in Makhachkala in Russia.

He had previously said that he would return to America this week in the wake of the death of his elder son Tamerlan and the arrest of 19-year-old Dzhokhar.

The suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, yesterday said that her husband would fly to the U.S. on Wednesday, adding that the family hoped to bring Tamerlan's body back to Russia.

Suspects: Dzhokhar, left, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are accused of killing three people at the Boston Marathon

Both parents have strenuously denied their sons' guilt for the bombing which killed three people and injured more than 170 at the finish line of the Boston Marathon last Sunday.

They have accused the U.S. authorities of framing Tamerlan and Dzhokhar - Mr Tsarnaev described the death of his son as an 'inside job, while Mrs Tsarnaeva claimed that the government 'wanted to eliminate' Tamerlan, 26.

Mr Tsarnaev, 47, has said that he spoke to his sons in the aftermath of the bombing, before he knew they were responsible.

They apparently reassured him that they were safe, saying: 'Everything is good, Daddy. Everything is very good.'

He claims that Dzhokhar, who is in hospital after shooting himself in the head when he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown, Massachusetts, is not being allowed to talk to his relatives.

'They're not letting anyone from the family see him,' Mr Tsarnaev said. 'All we know is what we hear from television.'

Mrs Tsarnaeva, 46, also spoke to the alleged terrorists after the attack - and Tamerlan phoned her moments before his death to say goodbye.

'The police, they have started shooting at us, they are chasing us,' he said, then hung up after adding: 'Mama, I love you.'

She told the Daily Telegraph yesterday she was proud of her sons, and once again insisted that they could not be guilty of the atrocity.

While she admitted that Tamerlan, who had become an increasingly strict Muslim, had dabbled in terrorist-related reading materials, she denied that he would act on the jihadist sentiments.

'Reading extremist materials does not make you a terrorist,' she said. 'Tamerlan told the FBI men, "I read many things - I read Pushkin and Doestoyevsky too." He was an erudite boy.'

Mrs Tsarnaeva added that she thought the U.S. security service was responsible for the bomb, and had decided to frame her sons to justify monitoring them.

'It's a big show, a spectacle,' she said. 'Americans love a show.'

However, other family members have been less keen to defend the alleged terrorists - their uncle Ruslan Tsarni claimed that the pair had been pushed into radical circles by their 'controlling' mother.

He told MailOnline: 'These kids, I thought she's not doing enough. She's not doing them right, especially when they grew up.â€™

And when they came under the influence of extremist preachers, Mrs Tsarnaeva did not attempt to dissuade them, he added.

In contrast to the Tsarnaevs' steady stream of loud denials, the dead suspect's widow has not spoken out since her husband was implicated in the bombing.

Katherine Russell, the mother of Tamerlan's three-year-old child, has kept a stubborn silence in the wake of his death in a shoot-out with police in the early hours of Friday morning.

She has been co-operating with the FBI investigation into the attack, according to her lawyer.

Amato DeLuca told CNN his client was 'a really good person', adding: 'Katie is just trying to bring up her daughter.'

Tamerlan apparently wanted to bring his wife, who had converted to Islam, with him to Dagestan, the Muslim-dominated state where he grew up before emigrating to Boston.
