When Cyclone Ita northern hit Queensland in April, it did so with a devastating force of 105 miles per hour (170km/h).

While large parts of infrastructure inland were able to weather the storm, areas of the delicate Great Barrier Reef weren’t so lucky.

Now scientists have revealed the extent of the devastation using specially developed underwater imaging techniques that reveal before and after shot os the area in unprecedented detail.

When Cyclone Ita northern Queensland in Australia in April, it did so with a devastating force of 105 miles per hour (170km/h). While large areas of infrastructure inland were able to weather the storm, areas of the delicate Great Barrier Reef weren’t so lucky. A

Cyclone Ita. The right image shows the dead coral following the storm 
which hit the region in April

To create the amazing underwater images, Google and the Caitlin survey developed the first ever tablet-operated underwater cameras.

Complete with their own propulsion system, the images are captured through a spherical camera housing that allows continuous high-resolution, 360-degree imagery to be collected as divers steer through the reefs.

On a typical run it will capture over 1000 panoramas, which are then stitched together to produce a virtual dive experience. 

In the aftermath of Ita, the Catlin Seaview Survey sent a team of divers into the Great Barrier Reef to see how badly the storm had impacted the area.  

The team had previously surveyed the area in 2012, in collaboration with Google, to create an underwater ‘street view’ of the region.

Equipped with the first ever tablet-operated underwater camera, dubbed SVII, divers were able to see the dead corals, damaged reefs and destroyed sea life left in the wake of the storm.

Ita was the second major storm in three years to hit the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea off the North East Australian coast.

Despite their devastating power, up until now, the impact cyclones have on coral reefs was unpredictable and relatively unknown.

The team found that the Ribbon Reef region of the Great Barrier Reef suffered most as Cyclone Ita passed directly overhead.

However, there was less impact at Osprey Reef in the Coral Sea because the centre of the storm passed about 56 miles (90km) away.

Institute's Peter Dalton as he surveys the damage to the area

The most striking observation was the huge variance of storm impact and no uniform pattern of damage in the path of the storm.

On Osprey Reef it was evident that some areas are more robust, with some parts naturally protected from storms.

While the outer walls of the reef lying closer to the path of the cyclone were damaged, these corals are relatively hardy and are expected to recover, the scientists said.

Acting as a breakwater, the reefs themselves seem to have reduced the power of the storm’s impact and, as a result, Cyclone Ita left those areas mostly intact.

But there were more pockets of intense damage found in the shallower Ribbon Reefs on the Great Barrier Reef closer to the coastline.

‘We found areas with extensive damage next to perfectly healthy reefs that appeared virtually unaffected by the storm’ said Richard Vevers, one of the divers and director of the Catlin Seaview Survey’s Project.

‘There were differences not just between the sheltered and exposed parts of reefs, but also differing levels of damage to areas immediately adjacent to one another’.

 Barrier Reef earlier this year

The team now want to find out how the overall structures of the reefs may have channelled the force of the waves, creating the varied pattern of damage.

‘There is a myriad of increasing and cumulative impacts on the Great Barrier Reef,’ said Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, the Catlin Seaview Survey chief scientist.

‘We can control impacts such as fishing, coastal development and marine debris. However, we do not have the same control over storms and cyclones.

‘Ensuring that coral can bounce back from these disturbances is at the heart of the matter. The more we reduce other stressors on the reef, the better the chance that coral can bounce back.

‘Given the steep decline of coral on the reef, it’s clear we have a lot of work to do.’
