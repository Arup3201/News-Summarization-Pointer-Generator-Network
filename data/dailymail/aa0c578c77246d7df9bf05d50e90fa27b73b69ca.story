Three men are charged with digging up the cremated remains of two relatives and moving them to another cemetery in Maine.

Authorities say 42-year-old Kevin Lewis, his brother Travis Lewis, 37, and their uncle Calvin Lewis, 71, are charged with abuse of a corpse.

Police say the men dug up the remains of Richard Lewis and his son - who shared the same name - from a cemetery in Standish last fall, then reburied them in the family plot in Limington.

The elder Richard Lewis was Calvin Lewis' brother and the father of the other two men.

The remains were returned to their original resting place on August 2.

It
 was the former girlfriend of the younger Richard Lewis - also the 
mother of his children - who alerted the Cumberland County Sheriff’s 
Office about the ashes being moved.

She learned about the incident in July after Kevin Lewis believed she should know.

She
 objected to the remains being moved because she had purchased the 
burial plot for her ex-boyfriend, who died in 2007 in a motorcycle 
accident, for $200.

His
 father, whose his ashes were kept at a family member’s house for many 
years after his death in 2003, was eventually laid to rest in the same 
spot.

Kevin Lewis, who is now based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, told the Portland Press Herald that the men thought they 'had a right' to move family members and the graves were not marked where they were.

'My father’s parents are there [in Limington] and it’s where everybody else will be buried,' he said of moving his father, Richard Lewis and brother, Richard 'Trent' Lewis, to the family plot.

However, the law does not differentiate between ashes and physical remains and the men have been issued a summons to appear in Bridgton District Court on November 18 on a charge of abuse of a corpse.
