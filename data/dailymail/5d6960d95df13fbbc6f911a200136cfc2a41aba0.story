Mario Balotelli's transfer to Liverpool appears to be nearing completion, and the Italian striker does not seem to envisage any last-minute hiccups in the deal as he spent time with his brother.

The AC Milan striker posted a photograph on Instagram of himself with his friends and his smiling sibling, Enoch.

The 24-year-old's £16million move to Anfield looks set to be completed imminently.

Incoming: Mario Balotelli has been to Liverpool to complete his £16million move from AC Milan

He travelled to Liverpool's Melwood training ground last week and completed both parts of his medical.

Balotelli has agreed a three-year, heavily incentivised £90,000-per-week contract and Mino Raiola, the forward’s long-term adviser, has urged him to seize the opportunity.

Having already played for Manchester City, Inter Milan and AC Milan it is unlikely Balotelli will get another big move if he fails to settle at Liverpool.

During his time at the Etihad, Balotelli netted 30 goals in 80 appearances.

He also scored 18 goals in 41 matches for Milan last season.
