Vince Cable today warned Royal Mail to stop 'scaremongering' that deliveries which allow letters to be sent anywhere in the country for the same price are under threat.

The Business Secretary said the firm - part-owned by the taxpayer - must stop 'whinging' about competition from rival companies 'cherry-picking' the delivery of letters and parcels in high density areas.

It comes after Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, told MPs that the 'precious' universal service obligation is under threat with competitors undermining her firm's economics.

Business Secretary Vince Cable hit back at claims from Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, that the the universal delivery service was being threatened by rival firms taking lucrative work in big cities

Last week profits in Royal Mail slumped after Amazon shook up the parcels market by setting up its own delivery network. Royal Mail profits fell from £353 million to £279 million.

The universal service obligation (USO) cost £7.2 billion a year because of the high cost of delivering post to rural and remote areas of the UK.

Giving evidence to the business select committee today, Ms Greene said: 'The universal service is a precious service. It its essential for most people in Britain and it has a fixed cost.

'It requires a number of internal subsidies in order to make the economics work.

'So for example, the low cost urban areas are needed - and mail that's high density and high volume mail are needed - to cross-subsidise the suburban and rural areas which are much higher cost.

'If you allow cherry-picking in urban areas you undermine the economics. It siphons off very quickly a lot of revenue. It makes the universal service uneconomic.'

'Unlike many universal services in the world, we do not require or rely on government subsidy.'

She insisted the firm has made 'great strides' in making efficiencies.

Royal Mail was part privatised last year in a controversial sell-off which critics claimed saw shares bought on the cheap.

Today Mr Cable insisted the competition in the postal market was known at the time of the flotation and Royal Mail should stop suggesting the universal service was in jeopardy.

He told IT News: 'It is scaremongering. There is no prospect of the universal service obligation being removed.

'The truth of the matter is the Royal Mail is operating in a very competitive market.

'We knew that when we brought in private ownership. It was very clear to anybody that bought shares that they were operating in this very competitive market.

'And we don't want frankly people whinging about it. They have got to compete.'

Royal Mail needs the high volume, low cost work delivering letters in built-up areas to subsidise the cost of services in rural areas

Royal Mail has lost 50,000 staff in the last decade, and is shedding 2-3,000 jobs a year, she added.

Letter deliveries are falling by around 4-6 per cent a year and competitors taking business off the Royal Mail in urban areas was making the USO 'uneconomic', she said.

Officials from competitors Whistl and UK Mail denied they were cherry picking work, or that they threatened the universal service.

But the Unite union warned: ' The postal service is a bit like the Nation Health Service (NHS). We want the assurance that it is there if we need it.

'However competitors to the Royal Mail are again like the privateers in the NHS.

'They are happy to do the ingrowing toe nails and the tonsil removal operation but, not to do those that require high cost / low return after care or expensive drug treatments.'

Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), told the MPs: 'The sustainability of the USO faces its greatest threat.'

As well as competition, postal workers were delivering to more and more addresses, while the number of letters was declining, he said.

Mr Ward added that unions could not understand why the regulator Ofcom was still to decide if it will bring forward a review of the USO from next year.

CWU general secretary Billy Hayes said he wanted Royal Mail's competitors to publish their employees' pay and conditions so there was transparency across the industry.

As the UK's 'universal service' provider, Royal Mail is required to provide access to competitors such as TNT for final mile deliveries.

Postal regulator Ofcom is investigating a complaint from TNT over Royal Mail's decision to change conditions and increase the prices it charges to deliver post collected and pre-sorted by its competitors. 

Labour's shadow trade minister Ian Murray said: 'This stark warning from the Chief Executive of Royal Mail will be deeply worrying for the millions of consumers and small businesses who rely on Royal Mail's six-day delivery and essential services.

'Labour warned that David Cameron's Royal Mail fire sale would put vital services at risk, and Moya Greene's evidence today has confirmed our worst fears. IT comes after taxpayers were short changed by hundreds of millions of pounds by the botched sale.

'Ministers urgently need to clarify what action they will take to secure the future of postal services following the mess created by their botched fire sale.'
