Roma's rise over the past eighteen months has been remarkable, the appointment of Rudi Garcia in June 2013 the first step in a huge transformation of the Italian club's fortunes both on and off the field.

Despite initial fears after being drawn in Group E with both Bayern Munich and Manchester City, the Giallorossi now stand on the verge of a place in the knockout stages, easily capable of notching the win they need over the reigning Premier League Champions.

Not only is their destiny in their own hands, it is also highly likely after yet another disappointing showing in the competition from Manuel Pellegrini's side.

Manager Rudi Garcia has transformed Roma during his 18 months in charge of the club 

Garcia's attacking brand of football is the perfect formula for overcoming Manchester City

Roma play an exciting and entertaining brand of attacking football that is both rarely seen on the peninsula and ideal for exploiting the weaknesses City have shown.

The pace and width that domestic opponents have proven ill-equipped to cope with has set new club records for most points (85), wins (26) and clean sheets (21) in a season and is also the perfect formula for overcoming Wednesday's opponents.

As CSKA Moscow showed at the Etihad last month, Gael Clichy remains a liability, committing errors from which the Russian side scored both their goals in an embarrassing 2-1 win.

With Gervinho in the kind of form that makes him unrecognisable from the forlorn figure seen at Arsenal and Juan Manuel Iturbe a similarly frightening prospect, Roma's wingers will give the French defender another torrid evening.

Francesco Totti retains his sharpness and intelligence and Roma's play is dictated by the classy forward 

His two seasons in England saw him ridiculed constantly, but a reunion with former Lille boss Garcia has seen Gervinho deliver at the level which saw Arsene Wenger invest over £10 million in him back in 2011. In fifty games for Roma, he has netted fourteen goals and the same number of assists, a vital part of that impressive attacking trident based around the timeless talent of Francesco Totti.

As he showed in the first meeting with City, the club captain retains the sharpness and intelligence that has always typified his performances. A well-taken goal saw him embarrass a sluggish defence, and his team-mates are perfectly set-up to continue that in Wednesday's crucial final encounter.

Their 4-3-3 formation is built upon an excellent midfield, the likes of Daniele De Rossi, Miralem Pjanic and the returning Kevin Strootman possessing the quality needed at this level.

'We have a good chance of winning,' Florenzi said this week, 'because we're a good team capable of putting City in difficulty.'

Manchester City will be without star striker Sergio Aguero, who injured his knee against Everton on Saturday

Yaya Toure will also be absent for the Premier League champions through suspension

With Yaya Toure suspended and Sergio Agüero injured, Roma firmly believe they can overcome the reigning Premier League champions. They remain unpredictable, a point highlighted by their two previous home games in the competition in which they despatched CSKA Moscow 5-1, but were then demolished 7-1 by Bayern Munich.

With the Stadio Olimpico always a tough place for visiting teams, Roma play a style which the crowd in the capital city loves, seeing the volume raise even higher in appreciation of the players representing them.

It is into that atmosphere that City will be treading on Wednesday evening, and the Giallorossi should be more than good enough to secure the point they need to progress.
