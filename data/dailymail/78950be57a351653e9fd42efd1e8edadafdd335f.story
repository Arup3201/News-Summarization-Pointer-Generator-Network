A Russian policeman had to cling on for dear life when a rogue driver sped off during a roadside check, and took the officer with him on his car bonnet.

The policeman was stuck on the bonnet of the car for three miles before his colleagues were able to stop the 24-year-old driver by shooting his tyres flat. 

The incident was filmed by a fellow driver, and the clip sees a white Toyota speed past other vehicles with the policeman on the bonnet.

Novel Tretyakov, 37, accidentally filmed the incident on the outskirts of the city of Omsk in southern Russia's Omsk Oblast, with his car's dashcam.

'I was parked at the side of the road and wanted to pull onto the main road and then turn left,' Mr Tretyakov explains.

'I could see my review mirror that there was a car coming up behind me so I waited for it to go past, but couldn't believe it when I saw it had a policeman clinging to the front.

'I'm surprised the driver could see, but he was driving along at a normal speed almost as if there was nothing unusual. 

'It was actually quite comical although I guess pretty dangerous and frightening for the policeman.' 

Hold tight: The policeman had stopped the driver for a roadside check, and in an attempt to avoid getting caught driving without a license, the 24-year-old sped off

The incident took place last Friday when police officers carrying out a routine roadside check had tried to stop a Toyota Vitz, which had then sped off.

Police spokesman Trofim Zhirov said: 'We set up a roadblock a short distance away, but the driver pushed the police car out of the way with his own vehicle, and then ended up collecting a police officer on his bonnet when he tried to stop the car.'

Police eventually stopped the Toyota driver by shooting out his tyres and rescued the shocked police officer after he was carried three miles.

Bad move: The 24-year-old driver faces attempted murder charges in addition to motoring offences

Spokesman Zhirov added: 'The officer could have been badly hurt at any stage if he had fallen in front of the vehicle. 

'Given that it was a snow-covered road there is no chance the driver could have stopped. He was arrested, and the case is being prepared against him.' 

The 24-year-old offender has a history of dangerous driving, and was driving without a license, as it had been revoked in the summer.

He now faces attempted murder charges in addition to motoring offences.
