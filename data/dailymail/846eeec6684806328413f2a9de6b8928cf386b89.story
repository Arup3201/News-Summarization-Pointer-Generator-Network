Legal action: Three women who were assaulted by jailed Max Clifford are suing the disgraced PR guru, just a day after his wife divorced him

Three women who were assaulted by jailed Max Clifford have today revealed they are suing the disgraced PR guru, just a day after his wife divorced him.

The 71-year-old, who was thought to be worth £10m before his trial at Southwark Crown Court, was sentenced to eight 
years in prison earlier this month for eight assaults on four women 
between 1977 and 1984.

Today one of the women taking legal action said: 'I was young and impressionable when I met Max Clifford and he used that to exploit me. It is right that he is held accountable for his actions.'

Clifford fell from grace after decades influencing the media when he became the first person to be successfully prosecuted under sex crime investigation Operation Yewtree.

A number of his current and former high profile clients moved to distance themselves from the veteran agent in the wake of the string of guilty verdicts and his subsequent jail term.

The women’s solicitor Richard Scorer, of Slater and Gordon, said: 'Clifford used his fame and public persona as a cloak to mask his sexual perversions. We are investigating all of Clifford’s assets, including those of his companies, Max Clifford Associates and Max Clifford Media.

'We represent three women who have approached us for advice and we fully expect others to follow. I urge all of his victims to seek legal advice with a view to redress under the law.'

Clifford has two large homes in Hersham, Sussex, one he valued at £3.5million in 2008 and another, which his daughter Louise lives in, he valued at £2.5million five years ago.

The Land Registry says property prices in the area have increased by around five per cent a year since then, meaning the two homes could now have a combined worth of up to £8million.

The PR expert also has a house in an exclusive golf development in the hills near Nuevo Andalucia, southern Spain, which he valued at £1.5million in 2008.

Clifford has said he made £2.5million a year from his PR work. The latest accounts for his company, Max Clifford Associates, in 2012 show a turnover of around £3.5million and give the firm an estimated worth of £1.2million.

Worth: Clifford was thought to be worth around £10million before his trial, and owns a number of properties including this house near Walton on Thames, Surrey

He has also boasted that he got a new Bentley - each worth £200,000 - every two years.

However, his legal bills are thought to amount to more than £250,000 and it has been claimed that he has written to previous clients asking for their financial help to meet these costs.

Yesterday a judge signalled an end to Clifford’s four-year marriage to wife Jo as the couple were granted a decree nisi in the Central Family Court in London.

Neither was at the hearing, which lasted just 105 seconds, although each was represented by a lawyer.

In happier times: Legal papers showed that Mrs Clifford had filed for divorce on the grounds of 'unreasonable behaviour'

Divorce papers showed that Mrs Clifford had filed for divorce on the grounds of 'unreasonable behaviour'.

She said Clifford’s behaviour had affected her health and had written: 'I suffered from stress and had heart palpitation and saw a specialist.'

Mrs Clifford had signed the petition on August 14 2013.

And she noted the date of the 'final incident' she relied on as August 18 2012 - nearly four months before Clifford was arrested on suspicion of committing sex offences.

Lawyer Raymond Tooth, who represented Mrs Clifford, said after the hearing: 'Everything has been settled amicably.'

Clifford remained defiant despite the guilty verdicts in his trial and his lawyers said they planned to appeal against his sentence, and potentially his conviction.
