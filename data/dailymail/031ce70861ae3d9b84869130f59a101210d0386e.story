Eight people are dead and at least 105 are ill as from an outbreak of fungal meningitis sweeping America after tainted steroid injections. The eighth fatality was in Tennessee.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated the count on Monday. The list of nine states with reported cases stayed the same. Tennessee, Michigan, Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina and Ohio previously reported cases.

Health officials investigating the cause of the rare inflammatory disease discovered fungal contamination of a batch of spinal steroid injections, often used for pain, made by The New England Compounding Center and have advised health professionals against using any of its products.

The pharmacy issued a recall of all its products on Saturday calling their decision a precautionary measure with no other products indicated as being contaminated.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted updated figures to its website on Monday showing there are 101 confirmed cases of the rare form of fungal meningitis.

The steroid linked to the outbreak had already been recalled, and health officials have been scrambling to notify anyone who may have received an injection of it.

Dr. Benjamin Park of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised: If patients are concerned, they should contact their physician to find out if they received a medicine from one of these lots.

He went on to say that most cases have occurred in older adults seeking treatment for back pain who were otherwise healthy.

The Massachusetts pharmacy that made it has said it is cooperating with investigators.

It is not yet known exactly how many people may have been affected, though it could affect hundreds or even thousands of people who received the steroid injections for back pain from July to September.

Meningitis is caused by the inflammation of protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.

Fungal meningitis is not contagious as are its more common viral and bacterial counterparts.

The outbreak of the disease, known as aspergillus meningitis, is caused by a fungus found in a spinal steroid injections, a fairly common treatment used to relieve back pain, according to the FDA.

The sixth and seventh fatalities were reported in Michigan on Saturday, though the Michigan Department of Community Health said they would not provide more information on the two deaths over the weekend.

The caretaker: Diana Reed dedicated her life to helping underprivileged children before a routine medical procedure infected her with a rare fungal meningitis

The fifth victim, Diana Reed, died on Wednesday afternoon at St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, surrounded by family members.

Mrs
Reed, 56, is one of thousands of patients recently treated in Tennessee
hospitals for back pain with a steroid epidural - a fairly typical 
treatment. But since then a tainted batch of steroids released across 
the U.S. has been linked to dozens of cases of fungal meningitis.

Mrs Reed, of Brentwood, Tennessee, was the fifth person to succumb to the infection.

A blog written by a close friend of Reed's family, Brandon Scott Thomas, characterized her as 'hilarious, beautiful, and full of life' and praised her for carrying for husband Wayne Reed after he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease - almost 20 years ago.

'Over the course of the last week she has gone from someone brimming with life to someone in the process of passing from this life to the next,' wrote.

'Her brain couldn't take the stress. After a series of strokes they moved her to hospice care. Wayne, one of the longest surviving patients with ALS, there by her side.'

Reed served on the board of her husband's namesake child care organization, the Wayne Reed Christian Child Care Center.

The injectable steroids responsible 
for Reed's death were produced by New England Compounding Center, a 
specialized pharmacy in Framingham, Massachusetts. The company has shut down operations and said it is working with regulators to identify the source of the infection.

It is not clear how many patients received tainted injections, or even whether everyone who got one will get sick.

An unknown number of their 17,676 single-dose vials of
the steroid reached 75 clinics 
and other facilities in 23 states between July and September, federal 
health officials said. Several hundred of the vials, maybe more, have 
been returned unused, one Massachusetts official said.

Stepping back: The FDA previously told specialists not to administer New England Compounding Center's products but only on Saturday did the pharmacy admit a potential problem

However many other vials were used. At one clinic in Evansville, Indiana, more than 500 patients got shots from the suspect lots, officials said. At two clinics in Tennessee, more than 900 patients received them.

The incubation period before symptoms appear is 28 days, and its almost certain more cases will be reported say health officials, who are now calling this a national health crisis.

Tennessee: The initial outbreak site with a suspected 16 cases, two of whom are in critical condition. Three others have already died.

North Carolina: The second state to report infection with one case found at an unidentified clinic.

Florida: Only two cases have been reported but health officials fear more may come forward.

Virginia: One person has died from fungal meningitis and three more cases are still being treated.

Maryland: Seven medical clinics in Maryland pulled their stock of a questionable steroid after one person died and two more cases were reported.

Indiana: At least five people in Indiana are sick with fungal meningitis, with no fatalities yet reported

Michigan: There are at least eight confirmed cases of meningitis in Michigan, including two deaths

Minnesota: Fungal meningitis has been diagnosed in two women hospitalized in Minnesota

Ohio: Health officials reported Saturday of a 65-year-old man being treated for the meningitis after receiving the steroid

Unlike the more common viral and bacterial meningitis, fungal meningitis is not contagious. It is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.

Symptoms include a severe headache, nausea, fever, and dizziness.

The first patients identified in Tennessee experienced slurred speech, and difficulty walking and urinating.

The pharmacy voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid Methylprednisolone Acetate on September 26 according to the FDA.

The drug was administered to patients in their late 40s to early 80s.

Tennessee's S. Thomas Hospital, ground zero for the outbreak with a suspected 15 cases as of Wednesday with two in critical condition, reported having 2,000 vials of the steroid in stock before the threat was discovered.Â 

'Some are doing well and improving. Some are very ill - very, very 
seriously ill and may die,' Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan 
said.

In Tennessee alone roughly 1,000 people were administered the steroid.

The link between the injections and the 
meningitis was discovered by Tennessee physician April Pettit, who found
the initial cases were all people who'd recently received an epidural.

Officials are still investigating how the steroid resulted in fungal meningitis.

New England Compounding Center 
released a statement promising to work with heath authorities to 
discover what happened. But company president and licensed pharmacist 
Barry J. Cadden has otherwise dodged interview requests and the company 
web site is down.

An archived version of the site notes the company is licensed to distribute drugs in every U.S. state.

Critical condition: Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan says the infected are 'very, very seriously ill and may die'

New England Compounding Center is among the approximately 3,000 U.S. compounding pharmacies specializing in blending, liquefying, or combining medicines customized for patients unable to swallow tablets, require specific dosages, or who have allergies.

Such companies are regulated by the 
state boards of pharmacy that license them rather than facing the 
broader regulations traditional drug companies deal with.

The pharmacy has produced questionable
products before. In 2006, New England Compounding Center was one of 
four companies ordered by the the Food and Drug Administration to cease 
producing a topical anesthetic cream that was found to cause 'grave 
reactions including seizures and irregular heartbeats.'

The cream was the cause of two deaths, neither tied directly to New England Compounding Center.

Ground zero: The first patients of the fungal meningitis were reported at St. Thomas Hospital which had roughly 2,000 vials of a dangerous steroid on stock

That same year the company was also cited for multiple violations of federal laws and regulations based on a 2004 review of its offices. They were charged with misbranding drugs prescribed for eye treatment, misbranding an anesthetic drug and failing to provide adequate directions for its use, and promoting the use of a cancer drug for an unapproved purpose.

An FDA warning letter admonished the company that it was 'distributing an unapproved drug in violation' of federal regulations.

In 2010 the company was sued by an Illinois firm that alleged New England Compounding Center illegally hacked its database violating the federal computer computer fraud and abuse act. The case was eventually settled.
