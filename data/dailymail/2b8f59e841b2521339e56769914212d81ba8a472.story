The British teenager suspected of shooting dead a Florida police officer had recently been thrown out of her home by her parents after rows over her boyfriend and her arrest on drug offenses.

Alexandria Hollinghurst and her boyfriend Brandon Goode gunned down a police officer in a wealthy suburb of Orlando on Saturday before apparently taking their own lives. Authorities said the teenagers had both left behind suicide notes.

The tragedy came after 17-year-old Hollinghurst, who was born in the north of England, moved in with Goode, 18, after her parents Matthew and Debra objected to his 'druggie' lifestyle.

Police records also reveal he had threatened his mother with an axe when he was just 16.

Tragedy: Alex Hollinghurst died early Saturday - but police could have had an opportunity to stop her and Goode when they encountered them at a Walgreens pharmacy in Florida 24-hours before they allegedly died

Last
 month, she was arrested with him after they were found to be in 
possession of marijuana but as she is a juvenile, details of her court 
appearance are not for public record.

Her
 name was redacted from the arrest report, but a police source confirmed
 she was the 17-year-old girl who was arrested with Goode on February 
24th was Hollinghurst.

It was this incident that led to Hollinghurst moving out of her parent's home in Davenport, Florida.

'Matthew
 and Debra tried to stop Alex from seeing this guy and they just kept on
 rowing,' said a friend. 'The arrest last month was the final straw for 
them, and she moved out after rowing all the time. She was coming home 
at all hours.'

Friends
 of Hollinghurst said her parents, who emigrated from Manchester in 
2011, disapproved of Goode who was previously arrested for aggravated 
assault when he threatened his mum with an axe.

In the 2012 incident, he had painted his face black, covered the windows of his home, armed himself with an axe and when his mother returned home, he demanded she accept his father's divorce settlement, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

'Alex
 had moved into Brandon's home because her parents threw her out,' said a
 friend who attended the same high school as the teenagers. They did not like Brandon because he was involved in drugs and made no secret that he liked to smoke weed.'

Neighbors of Goode, who lived with his divorced mum Connie, confirmed that they often saw blonde Alex at the home.

'She
 was here all the time, and a cute girl,' said neighbor George Koop. 
'They would go out together in his car, often coming back late at 
night.'

On Monday, it emerged that the teenagers had been reported as being 'missing endangered' after two separate notes were found by their families.

As
 police only recovered one weapon it would seem the teenagers took it in turns to shoot 
themselves as part of a suicide pact.

Their bodies were found 100 yards from where officer Robert German was gunned down. They apparently shot him after he stopped them during a routine foot patrol through the neighborhood.

A police spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office said: 'The OSCO has been given suicide notes written by both individuals. The contents of those notes will not be revealed at this time, as the investigation is active and open.

'During the course of this homicide investigation, the OSCO investigations learned from Polk County authorities, that the suspects were considered missing endangered due to the suicidal notes.

'That information was entered by Polk County into the system.'

Mystery: Police say they found a male and female, both white and in their early 20s, dead in brush on the property of this home - they are believed to have committed suicide

Police also revealed that they have found Goode's car in a parking lot more than 20 miles away in Kissimmee.

The statement added: 'Goode and Hollinghurst are now officially considered suspects in the homicide of Officer Robert German.'

The
 discovery of the notes has led to speculation that the pair had been 
considering 'suicide by cop' and set out to provoke the officer into 
opening fire on them.

It
 is not known why they shot German before he had a chance to use his 
service revolver or why they did not wait for other officers to arrive 
before taking their own lives.

German
 had called for back-up telling his radio dispatchers to say he was 
stopping the pair for suspicious activity. But when a patrol car arrived
 they found German shot in the head.

The officers then heard two gunshots and the bodies of Goode and Hollinghurst were found in bushes about 100 yards away.

The
 slain officer was wearing a body camera at the time and the footage 
will be reviewed as part of the investigation into the incident.

Attempts to resuscitate him were 
unsuccessful, he was soon pronounced dead at Orlando Regional Medical 
Center, authorities said.

Hollinghurst
 originally came from Oldham in Greater Manchester, England and her 
family had emigrated to the U.S. about six years ago. Former neighbors 
have spoken of their shock.

Locals
 in the village of Hadfield, Derbyshire, said Alexandria has a sister, 
Hannah, who is two or three years younger, and an older stepsister, 
Georgia, who is about 25 or 26 but did not live with the family.

The girls' parents were known as Tom and Debra Jane, or just Jane.

The
 current occupant of their old house, an end-terrace, said the property 
was re-possessed, then the family moved to the US, with letters arriving
 for them always addressed to Tom or Jane.

The
 woman, who did not wish to be named, said Mr Hollinghurst was involved 
in a concrete or building business before they emigrated and added: 'I'm
 really shocked, I hadn't heard anything about this.'

Another neighbour was visibly shaken, saying: 'I'm too shocked to talk at the moment. I can't believe what's happened.'

Andrew
 Cartledge, headteacher of St Andrew's C.E Junior School, in Hadfield, 
Derbyshire, paid tribute to Alex. He told ITV News: 'She was with us 
until the age of 11.

'She was an able pupil, sociable, with a lot of friends. Our thoughts are with her and her family.'

Grace Etchells, who went to primary school with Alex also paid tribute to her on Twitter.

She
 wrote: 'So horrible knowing a very close friend from primary Alex 
Hollinghurst sadly got taken from us in such horrific circumstances. RIP
 lovely xx.'

Hollinghurst's family and friends insist on social media that she was murdered, that her death was not a suicide.

'I
 have friends whose daughter was murdered this morning in Florida,' a 
family friend wrote on Facebook. 'She was only 17... they think her 
boyfriend killed her.'

German
 came across the pair while conducting foot patrols Saturday morning, in
 the same exclusive gated community that Tiger Woods and ex-wife Elin 
Nordegren previously had a home.

Several
 people have expressed overwhelming sadness over the death of one of 
only 12 full time officers in the town of about 2,000.

'Windermere's heart is broken,' said Mayor Gary Bruhn.

'Robbie
 was one of the greatest men I have ever known,' Tara Boers wrote on a 
Facebook page dedicated to German. 'He loved being a police officer even
 knowing the risks involved. My daughter and I feel such loss today and 
will love him forever.'

A childhood neighbor of the fallen officer told WFTV he was 
shocked to hear German had been shot to death.

'Officer
 German was a good cop, he was one of the finest police officers that we
 had in this agency,' said Ogden, adding he had just returned to foot 
patrols this week after months behind a desk while rehabbing after 
shoulder surgery.

'This is such a nice safe area,' a local told News 13. 'It is unbelievable that this would happen.'

Several other people told local media the incident was shocking, and a terrible tragedy.

Police
 Chief David Ogden echoed that sentiment, noting: 'Our hearts, thoughts,
 and prayers are with Officer German's family during this difficult 
time.'

German attended 
Lake Mary High School, then studied at the Seminole State College police
 academy. He is survived by his mother and father.
