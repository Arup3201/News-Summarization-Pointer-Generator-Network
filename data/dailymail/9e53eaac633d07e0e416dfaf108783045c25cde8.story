It is the moment every airline passenger dreads - when the person in front suddenly reclines their seat so you can barely move.

Almost a third of flyers say the practice has caused them discomfort, and 3% have even suffered an injury.

Now a survey shows 9 out of 10 travellers want to see an end to it once and for all.

No more sitting back: A poll shows 91% believe short haul flights should either ban or set special times for seat reclining (file picture)

A poll shows 91% believe short haul flights should either ban or set special times for seat reclining.

And nearly half (43%) think there should be limits on long haul journeys too.

Global travel site Skyscanner quizzed over 1,000 flyers for the survey which also revealed some people were just downright selfish.

Nearly three quarters (70%) would not be put off reclining their seat even if the person behind was pregnant while 80% would not care if the person behind was elderly or frail.

Women aged 18 to 24 were the most thoughtful while the most egotistical travellers were likely to be men over the age of 35.

And while irritation and anger could be reduced if a passenger asked permission to recline their seat, the study found a third of people were too worried about the reaction they’d receive, and most (64%) had never done so.

An all-out ban on recliners could well be music to the ears of air stewards.

Over 60% of 900 international cabin crew who were also questioned say said they have been involved in, or witnessed, an argument between passengers on the subject of reclined seats.

Psychologist Dr. Becky Spelman, Clinical Director at the Private Therapy Clinic in Harley Street said she was not surprised at the survey results.

She said: 'The strong support for a change in reclined seat procedures makes sense

'The effect of people reclining their seat can result in various negative emotions such as anger, stress, anxiety, frustration and upset for the passenger behind them.

'This emotional impact can result in a whole range of unhelpful behaviours, including air rage.'

She said that was partly because there were two general personality types while travelling- the ‘Altruistic Soul’, who is considerate of fellow passengers, and the ‘Selfish Ego’ who looks to increase their comfort at the expense of others.

She added: 'Set times for seat reclining on planes could actually make for an improved experience for passengers.

'Such rules tend to ensure better social cohesion, as people are conditioned to obey boundaries.

'While these rules place a limit on the personal choice passengers have over their own comfort, people will generally adhere to them, accepting that it is fair. This could lead to a more pleasant flying experience for the majority.'
