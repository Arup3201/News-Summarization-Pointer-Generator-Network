Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock says co-owner Steve Parish is doubling up as chairman and director of football following the departure of Iain Moody.

Former sporting director Moody has not been replaced since quitting in August after he was caught up with Malky Mackay in a texting scandal that was revealed by Sportsmail.

It means Parish has taken on the new hands-on role alongside chief scout Tim Coe and Warnock in finding potential signings for the transfer window.

Strikers Bafetimbi Gomis of Swansea and Arsenal’s Yaya Sanogo are targets, while Palace have turned to Lille left back Pape Souare after failing to persuade Roma’s Ashley Cole to join on loan.

Warnock said: ‘The chairman is doing Iain Moody’s role at the moment. I’ve given him the names. He has spoken to the agents and clubs and he has made the offers. Every time I go into his office he is looking at players on his computer. He has taken more on his shoulders than he should do.

‘The more you take off the manager the better. You have so much to do as a Premier League manager, so many commitments.

‘The structure of the club will change next summer, if not before. Steve is looking for that now to take a bit of pressure off him.’

Warnock is glad to see the back of the playing surface after claiming his side’s survival chances have been hit in front of their own supporters.

He added: ‘At Swansea and Tottenham, in our recent away games, we covered 2,000 metres more according to the statistics.

‘The wingers can’t run on it. It’s like running on quicksand. The stats don’t lie and we have no option but to re-lay it.’
