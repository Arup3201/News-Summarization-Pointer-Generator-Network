A man accused of stabbing three Brits outside a Spanish bar during Halloween celebrations is a violent burglar who got a prison officer pregnant while he was in jail in the UK, it has emerged.

Kelly-Anne McDade gave birth to Nelson Delgado’s child after secret trysts in his cell at a young offenders institution in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

The Portuguese immigrant was serving an indeterminate sentence for aggravated burglary and assault after attacking a couple in their own home.

McDade, 31, when their child was born 
in February 2009, had to resign after she was caught on CCTV opening 
Delgado’s prison door following a night-time lockdown in August 2008.

She was jailed for 30 months at Aylesbury Crown Court in November 2009.

Delgado,
 who grew up in Britain, moved to Majorca to do bar work after being 
released from jail and started dating a British girl he met on the 
island.

Last night Delgado, 
now 25, was back behind bars after being held on suspicion of attempted 
murder and assault over the vicious assault in the party resort of 
Magaluf in the early hours of Friday morning.

Four
 people including three Brits were stabbed near the Red Lion pub in an 
attack police suspect was linked to a glassing in a nearby bar moments 
earlier.

Delgado had just finished his first summer season in Majorca as a public relations worker for local bars.

Suspect: Nelson Delgado, 25, from Portugal, was held by police after a knifeman went on the rampage outside a club in the party resort of Magaluf

He is believed to have moved to the island straight after his release from prison in Britain.

Alleged stabbing victim, nightclub 
manager Daniel Billingham, 34, is still in hospital receiving treatment 
for two stab wounds to his back.

His condition today was described as 'stable'.

His friend Sam Byrne, 30, was released from hospital after being treated for stab wounds to his stomach and arms.

Another British man and a Spaniard, who both live locally, are also out of hospital after receiving treatment for knife wounds.

Mr Billingham, speaking today about the attack, said: 'I think I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

'The attacker came looking for the 
person he blamed for hurting his brother earlier in a separate incident 
and picked on someone who had nothing to do with it.

'It’s all a bit hazy to be quite honest.

'All I remember is him asking me to step out into the street and then being attacked.

'I didn’t know I’d been stabbed till I took my shirt off and saw the blood.

'Sam tried to hold him with some other Brits who were there but he lashed out at him and got stabbed in the stomach and arms.

'We’ve heard some very unsavoury things about the alleged attacker since he was arrested.

'I didn’t know him but I’ve never seen him DJing anywhere locally.

'I’ve got lawyers onto it so hopefully he’ll be kept off the streets for a very long time now.'

Witnesses to the stabbing on Friday at
 around 4am have told police a man went on the rampage after wrongly 
targeting a group of Brits he thought had been behind the glassing of 
his brother Fabio earlier in the evening.

Locals said he lashed out 
indiscriminately at a gang of Brits who tried to stop him fleeing after 
the attack on nightclub manager Daniel Billingham.

Attack: Magaluf is one of Europe's top holiday destinations for young Britons but has been rocked by a series of attacks and deaths in recent years

Delgado was remanded in jail on 
Saturday after appearing before a judge investigating him on suspicion 
of attempted murder and assault.

He has not yet been charged with any 
crime, as is customary in Spain where suspects are only officially 
accused of crimes just before trial.

Questioned: Delgado, who is thought to have grown up in Britain, has been told he is being probed on suspicion of attempted murder

Brother Fabio is thought to have left Spain to return to Britain following the weekend incident.

Delgado was locked up in in 2007 for breaking into a couple’s home with a friend armed with a four-inch knife.

A judge at Bournemouth Crown Court 
branded him ‘dangerous’ after it emerged he punched his male victim and 
hit the woman over the head with a beer bottle before asking her if she 
had ever been raped.

The terrified woman told him she had the Aids virus in case he tried to force himself on her.

He admitted two charges of aggravated burglary, actual bodily harm and grevious bodily harm.

McDade had been working at Aylesbury 
Young Offenders Institution for three years when she started her sexual 
relationship with Delgado in 2008.

She told colleagues she had become pregnant after a holiday relationship.

When her home was searched after her 
arrest, police found a mobile phone with a message from Delgado which 
read, ‘I love you my wife.’

She carried on visiting him before she
 was jailed and reports at the time said they were planning to set up 
home together after they were both freed so they could bring up their 
son together.

Nigel Osborne, prosecuting, said the relationship could have caused a massive breach of security.

Judge Christopher Tyrer said when sentencing her: 'You engaged in a wholly improper sexual relationship with an inmate.

'He was in your care.'
