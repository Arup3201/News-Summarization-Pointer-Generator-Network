Boy band One Direction are Britain’s biggest pin-ups, selling more calendars than any other celebrity including long-time favourite Cliff Richard.

The 1D boys - Harry Styles, 19, Liam Payne, 20, Zayn Malik, 20, Niall Horan, 20, and Louis Tomlinson, 21 – have dominated calendar sales since their debut album three years ago according to Amazon’s all-time bestseller list.

One Direction beat Cliff Richard, who until 2011, topped calendar sales every year since online retailer Amazon started in 1998.

It's official: One Direction are Britain's top pin-ups, selling more calendars than any other celebrity according to Amazon's all-time bestseller list

Cheryl Cole, 30, was crowned the calendar queen beating Kylie Minogue, 45, and Kelly Brook, 33, to win the women’s poll.

Xavier Garambois, vice president of EU Retail at Amazon, said: ‘Before 2011, no one could get near Cliff Richard at the top of the calendar charts but One Direction’s unrivalled popularity has seen them shoot to the top of the all-time bestsellers list, almost doubling Cliff Richards’s all time sales in just three years.’

Cheryl Cole has topped female calendar sales at Amazon since 2009.

The results were released by Amazon ahead of their 15th anniversary tomorrow.

Darren Hardy, Amazon’s books manager, said: ‘In the battle of the sexes, the celebrity boys triumph.

'Cheryl and Kylie may top the female calendar chart but One Direction are outselling them by more than double with Christmas still to come.’

Also among the bestselling products of all time on Amazon were the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, Hunger Games and Kindle devices.

Mr Garambois said: ‘The all-time bestsellers tell a story of the major trends that have gripped the UK, from the game changers in entertainment to the products that have become essential to modern life. 

‘The list also showcases the advances in technology over the past 15 years.

'Technology is now a key part of everyday life as illustrated by the success of Kindle, the continued rise of the digital camera and the fact that more and more people are purchasing products to enhance their home viewing or entertainment experience.

'Advancements in technology have also meant that people can shop from anywhere, at anytime and purchasing through mobile devices is a trend that will only continue to grow.

‘Three big books bestsellers that have turned into major movie blockbusters also feature strongly, a clear sign that customers are eager to get the fix of their favourite stories in all formats.’

Amazon now sells more than 100 million items across over 30 categories.

The online retailer has more than 6,000 permanent employees in the UK.

This Christmas, Amazon will hire over 15,000 temporary associates across the UK to help deliver millions of products to customers.

During Amazon’s busiest 24 hour period over Christmas last year, a delivery lorry left one of Amazon’s eight UK fulfilment centres on average once every 2 minutes and 10 seconds. 

On its busiest day in the run up to Christmas (December 3), 3.5 million items were ordered - a rate of around 41 items ordered per second.
