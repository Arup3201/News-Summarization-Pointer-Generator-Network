What Christmas present do you buy for the relative who has everything? If they have a taste for fresh fish, olive oil and an Aegean Sea breeze you could get them their own Greek island.

A 16-acre land mass off the coast of one of the most beautiful islands in the Mediterranean has been put on the international market for the first time.

Little Lesbos is just minutes by boat from the  island of Lesbos and has an asking price of £633,680, less than the price of a two-bed flat in many parts of London.

Up for grabs: Little Lesbos is a 16-acre island on sale for £633,680 through Vladi Private Islands

While currently uninhabited, the estate agents say a building permit can be applied for at the local government agencies.

The island is located 200 metres opposite the sleepy village of Pamfila. Once there, it's a 10-minute drive to  Mytilini, Lesbos's capital and main port, founded in the eleventh century BC.

Lesbos is accessible by international airport or ferry  and is a favourite of travellers, thanks to its beautiful setting, history, fiery ouzo  and beaches.

The estate agents selling the small island say Mediterranean private islands rarely come o the market - and when they do, they often have an astronomical price-tag.

Little Lesbos has  clear water bays, smooth sandy beaches and an abundance of vegetation.

Sabine Rollinger, of Vladi Private Islands, which is marketing the sale, said: 'This is a one of a kind. The waters surrounding the island are clear and tranquil.

'Fresh water can be gained by installing rain catching or desalination systems. Sewage can be brought over to the mainland or composted.'

According to Vladi Private Islands, this is  the first time the current Greek owner had put the island up for sale internationally.

Legend has it that 3,000 years ago the Greek god Zeus visited Lesbos to put a curse on the larger island for 40 years, after his advances were rejected by a lesbian woman living there.

After the curse was lifted, visitors, so the story goes, were unable to find a single sexually mature man left on Lesbos. 

The island was populated by females sexually involved with other females instead.

Another explantion for where the meaning of the word lesbian derives from is the ancient Greek female poet Sappho, who was born in Lesbos and who wrote emotional verses aimed at women.

It's thanks to this association that Lesbos and especially the town of Eresos, the birthplace of Sappho, is a popular destination for lesbian tourists.
