If you have seen Monty Python’s Life of Brian and you’ve been following Spanish and European football over the last year or so then you can imagine the conversation supporters at the Santiago Bernabeu might have had on Saturday. I mean seriously – what did Gareth Bale ever do for Real Madrid?

It was in the 71st minute when Bale flew down the right and decided to shoot instead of pass to Cristiano Ronaldo who had made a run through the middle. The error of judgement provoked a crescendo of jeers from home supporters and a couple of expletives from Ronaldo. Cue the debate between supporters:

Bale was jeered by Real Madrid fans despite scoring an outstanding free-kick against Espanyol 

Supporter A: There he goes again shooting instead of passing. When is he going to start doing something for the team?

Supporter B: Well he did score the second goal with an unstoppable free-kick from about 30-yards out.

Supporter A: Yeah but that’s for his own glorification. When’s he going to start thinking about the team?

Supporter B: Well he did play a 40-yard cross-field pass straight on to Ronaldo’s boot in the first half that led to the opening goal.

Supporter A: Yeah but that’s today! What about the rest of the time he’s been here. What has Gareth Bale ever done for Real Madrid?

Supporter B: Well he did run half the length of the pitch in the 85th minute of the Copa del Rey final, running off the pitch and then back on to it to outsprint Marc Bartra before shooting past Jose Pinto for the first trophy of last season.

Supporter A: Yeah but that’s the Copa del Rey

Supporter B: Well he did score in the Champions League final. You remember the goal that finally put us in front against Atletico Madrid and meant we went on to win the Champions League.

Supporter A: Yeah but we always win the European Cup, we’ve won it 10 times.

Supporter B: Well we hadn’t won it for 11 years.

Supporter A: Yeah but I’m not talking about specific matches I’m talking about in general.

Supporter B: Well he has got 34 goals and 22 assists in 69 games since joining the club.

Supporter A: OK, so apart from making the first goal and scoring the second goal against Espanyol, with the pass of the season and the best free-kick of the season; scoring the winning goal in last season’s Copa del Rey final; scoring the decisive goal in last season's Champions League final; and scoring 34 goals and given 22 assists since joining… what has Gareth Bale ever done for us.

September 1: Bale signs for Real Madrid for a world record fee of £86 million

September 14: The Welshman scores on his Real Madrid debut in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal

October 30: Scores two and assists two on his first home start at the Bernabeu

November 30: First hat-trick - a 'perfect' one too - for Real Madrid, against Valladolid

April 16: Bale scores the winning goal in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona. His first goal against Madrid's bitter rivals, and his 20th of the season

May 24: The former Spurs man scores a goal in extra time in the Champions League final, which Madrid go on to win 4-1... it's a record 10th European title for the Spanish side

August 12: Bale's third trophy at Madrid - the European Super Cup. He sets up the first of Ronaldo's two goals in his home city of Cardiff

December 20: Another trophy for the Welshman, and a goal in this final too. Real Madrid beat San Lorenzo 2-0 to win the FIFA Club World Cup, with Bale netting the second

December 23: Reports surface of a potential exit, and 54 per cent of Real Madrid fans would be happy to see him leave for the right price

And so they jeered and whistled and Marca gave him 6.5 out of 10 in their match ratings. Perhaps there were mitigating circumstances. The Bernabeu was desperate for Ronaldo to score before he goes off to Zurich for Monday’s Ballon d’Or gala. Almost as desperate as he was to find the net. 

And with the benefit of the replay, Ronaldo’s run was a good one and Bale probably should have passed. Just as he should have passed the weekend before when Karim Benzema was in the clear against Valencia – another bad decision for which he has also received a disproportionate amount of criticism.

His first year-and-a-half at a new club has been little short of miraculous. It’s difficult to think of any other player who has made such an impact in his first 18 months playing for a new side in a different league. Yet Bale is cut little or no slack.

Manchester United’s interest in the player for now seems to amount to no more than the level of interest they have in all top players – laced with a little desire to give Real Madrid back a little of its own medicine: you want De Gea well we want Bale.

But if it ever becomes more than that, then the curious lack of warmth between the club and arguably its most productive signing since Zinedine Zidane will play massively in United’s favour.
