It appeared to be business as usual for Jeremy Clarkson today after he was spotted sharing a joke with fellow Top Gear presenter James May in China.

Despite the apparent banter, Clarkson, 51, showed signs of strain as he shot the new series of Top Gear in Beijing.

The controversial host - already under fire for suggesting public sector strikers 'be shot in front of their families' last week - hit the headlines again over the weekend amid growing concerns about his 'vulnerable state of mind' and the precarious state of his 18-year marriage.

He also provoked a fresh storm of protest after describing people who kill themselves by jumping under trains as 'selfish'.

One senior 
BBC insider, who asked not to be named, said Clarkson
wasn’t in ‘the best possible place at the moment’ in his personal life.

He added: ‘There is a feeling that 
he’s in a more vulnerable state than he should be and that’s why his 
judgment isn’t A-grade at the moment.’

But there is some good news for Clarkson - despite sparking fury with his outburst, his DVD sales have soared, according to HMV.

The DVD titled Powered Up, which sees Clarkson and the Stig in the south of France while searching for his 'favourite car of the year', is set to become a Christmas favourite.

An HMV spokesperson told the Guardian: 'We've found in the past that controversy involving artists, with all the media coverage this generates, can boost sales of their products.'

Industry experts have suggested that the incident would boost sales up as much as 50 per cent across online and high street sales.

Action: Clarkson last week jetted off to China amid a public outcry over his comments about striking public sector workers on The One Show

Nine months ago, allegations surfaced that the presenter had been having a 14-month 
affair with events organiser Philippa Sage, who works for a company 
which helped produce the Top Gear Live show.

Two
months later, the millionaire presenter was forced to deny reports he 
had been thrown out of the marital home in Chipping Norton, 
Oxfordshire, by his wife after he wrote about the delights of living in
an unfurnished flat in Central London.

The next day, Clarkson said that 
he had simply been using the flat as a bolt-hole while he was filming in
London.

Clarkson, who is reportedly paid £1million a year by the BBC, used his weekly column in The Sun newspaper to expand on comments he had made about suicide, which were aired during the same edition of The One Show last Wednesday.

At the
time these were overshadowed by his joke about the strikers, which has so
far attracted 31,000 complaints to the BBC.

But in his newspaper column Clarkson wrote that ‘foxy woxy and the birds’ should be left to ‘nibble’ at the ‘gooey parts’ of people who die by jumping in front of trains.

Three of the country’s leading mental health charities said they would complain to the Press Complaints Commission about the remarks, which they said intruded on private grief and breached PCC guidelines which restrict what newspapers can report about suicides for fear of encouraging copycat incidents.

The One Show immediately issued an on-air apology for the star’s remarks about suicide but did not address his comments about strikers.

It was widely assumed that Clarkson had also apologised for the remarks. But he denied having done so in his column on Saturday.

Corporation bosses had hoped the apologies would draw a line under the storm but Clarkson’s decision to return to the subject of what he called ‘Johnny Suicides’ in his newspaper column has only plunged him deeper into controversy.

Paul Farmer, chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said: ‘Jeremy Clarkson’s article in The Sun is extraordinarily tasteless and shows an utter lack of understanding of the tragedy of any suicide.

‘Many people who have contemplated suicide seriously or lost loved ones will be shocked by his insensitive tone and needless graphic detail.’

Under the heading ‘Think of the poor driver before your leap in front of Ivor’, Clarkson said he had every sympathy with those who felt the need to take their own lives.

But he went on to argue that suicide 
victims who ‘hurled’ themselves in front of trains were selfish and 
disruptive because they inconvenienced other members of the public.

He
wrote: ‘It is a very selfish way to go because the disruption it causes
is immense. And think of what it’s like for the poor train driver who 
sees you lying on the line and can do absolutely nothing to avoid a 
collision.’

Clarkson then bemoans the fact that trains which are involved in a collision with a person must stop until the full aftermath of the incident has been dealt with and all remains have been recovered from the vicinity.

He wrote: ‘The train cannot be moved nor the line re-opened until all of the victim’s body has been recovered.

‘This is the part I don’t understand. It’s not like the poor soul is going to get any better.

‘Change
the driver, pick up the big bits of what’s left of the victim, get the 
train moving as soon as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble 
away at the smaller, gooey parts that are far away or hard to find.’

Clarkson advises potential suicide victims to kill themselves quietly and privately.

Catherine Johnstone, the chief 
executive of the Samaritans, which is campaigning to reduce the number 
of suicides on the railway network, said the comments in the column went
beyond what he had said about suicide on The One Show and were far 
worse than anything he had ever said about striking  public sector 
workers.

She said: ‘His 
notion that suicide is a selfish act shows how little he knows about 
the subject because, if he did, he would know that when a person 
attempts suicide they are so distressed that they genuinely believe 
their families will be better off without them.

'The fact that he has 
chosen to add fuel to the flames of the comments he made on The One Show
again beggars belief.

‘It’s one thing to joke about people on strike, it’s in an entirely different realm of poor taste to joke about  suicide.’

Clarkson’s column also sparked an avalanche of complaints on Twitter and other social networking sites.

One fan tweeted: ‘Please stop. Shooting the strikers is one thing, but this is pretty indefensible. Beware sarcasm in print.’ Another added: ‘Really shocked by the  “train suicide” comments. Used  to like Jeremy Clarkson. Not so much now.’

But there were some signs of  support 
on Twitter and elsewhere. Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain,  of Maidenhead 
Synagogue, said: ‘I am totally sympathetic to the black depression that 
overtakes  those who commit suicide, and  certainly want to prevent any 
future ones, but Clarkson has done us a favour by saying out aloud that 
while people have the right to end their lives, they should not do so in
a way that scars others.’

The BBC declined to comment on Clarkson’s column in The Sun.

A
BBC spokesman was unable to comment on anything relating to the 
presenter’s private life and was unable to reach Clarkson because he was
in China.
