This is the terrifying moment a motorist was hurled through his windscreen and into the middle of the road after a head-on car crash - but incredibly managed to survive.

Artem Klavko, 38, badly misjudged the speed of an oncoming car when he tried to overtake another vehicle near Oryol, Russia, and the vehicles hit with a combined speed of 90mph.

The force was enough to throw Klavko, who was not wearing a seatbelt, clean through the windshield of his tuned-up Lada and into the road, but he was able to scramble away from the wreck alive.

Artem Klavko, 38, was lucky to escape with his life after being thrown through the windscreen of his car during a head-on collision in Russia

The video, which was captured on another driver's dashboard camera, starts as Klavko tries to overtake the bus in the outside lane

A police spokesman said: 'He didn't stand a chance because he wasn't wearing his seat belt.  He exited the car like a high-velocity missile and was lucky not to land on his head.

'Instead he was still conscious and able to crawl to the side of the highway to escape the traffic that was still moving.

'His passenger, one Igor Mihulov, 34, was also hurt in the crash.  Both were taken to a local hospital where they were told neither had suffered serious harm.'

He tries to follow another car (left) through the gap, but swerves into the path of the black Honda (centre) and the two come together with a combined speed of 90mph

As his car turns 180 degrees, the force of the impact throws Klavko through the windscreen and tumbling upside down into the middle of the road

The driver of the Honda which they hit was shocked and bruised but otherwise unharmed.

Alexander Kevsky, who witnessed the accident as he cut a grass verge nearby, told a local TV station: 'I saw this guy suddenly fly through the air like a rag doll. 

'I am surprised that he lived, it was not an accident I thought he would survive. He was holding his head and saying "What happened".'

Klavko tumbles to the ground and is left laying behind the back wheel of the Hona. Fortunately he is still conscious and able to crawl out of the road
