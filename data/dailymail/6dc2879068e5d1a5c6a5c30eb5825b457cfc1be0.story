The new Formula One campaign looks like it is going to be the wildest season I have ever seen.

We arrive in Melbourne for the Australian Grand Prix totally unsure of what is going to happen.

Some teams look like they will struggle to get their car to the start of the race, let alone the finish.

I am pretty sure we will have a half-a-dozen crazy races where we are going to see them grappling with the fuel, the tyres, the strategy, the reliability.

Indeed, have they done enough practice starts? What about the pit-stops? These are the things the teams usually have under control by now, but they just didn’t complete as much testing as normal over the winter.

Last year, the teams completed 11,000 laps between them in testing, but this year they managed only 7,000, and most of that was fundamentally getting their cars working. It hasn’t been fine tuning their race strategy, so who knows? If we get half the cars to the finish in Melbourne I will be impressed and surprised.

On the mic: Since retiring from F1 Brundle works as a broadcaster where he is currently at Sky Sports

Blast from the Past: Brundle competed in 158 F1 races, including the 1992 Mexico GP for Benetton Ford

Red Bull have been one of the teams to struggle over the winter and in a way I am not surprised because Adrian Newey has always packaged his cars in an extreme way, and over the full course of time that enabled him to win a lot of championships.

He is a purest and he does tend to push the limits which has been his success, but right now, it is giving him some headaches.

However, I wouldn’t write them off at all. They obviously have some early gremlins going on but I suspect that underneath that, there is a very competitive race car.

But it is whether they can find that car quickly enough, because at the moment they have clearly got a mountain to climb.

Williams on the other hand have impressed in pre-season testing. There is a comfort zone in that, like with Manchester Untied and Arsenal doing well, you need Williams to be at the sharp end of Formula One after all their historical success.

They have a lot of new personnel there, and they have chosen the right engine - it looks like Mercedes-Benz is the best package - so if you put that all together with a new initiative I am not surprised in the slightest that they are looking so strong. If they won one or more of the first races I would not be surprised either because it is going to be about reliability.

Rocky road: Brundle thinks it's going to be a tough campaign for Sebastian Vettel (right) and his Red Bull team

That said, the great drivers are always the great drivers and they will make better use of the tools available to them because they have got greater capacity to think about what is going on around them when they are in the car and out of the car.

Ayrton Senna would have loved these cars. He would have maximised all the tools and the levers that they have got available.

Legend: Ayrton Senna won three world titles before he died racing for Williams at the 1994 San Marino GP

A world champion probably needs 70 
per cent of his capacity to drive a car and that probably leaves 30 per 
cent to work out what is going on around him whereas a good driver needs
 80 per cent of his capacity to drive the car for example. 

The cream always rises to the top and 
the great drivers will still be up front, but I think the thinking 
driver has got more of a chance this year. It won’t just be about pedal 
to the metal.

Team to beat: Brundle believes Mercedes look the strongest outfit ahead of the 2014 F1 season and that their British driver Lewis Hamilton (left) will win his first Drivers' championship since 2008

Mercedes look the strongest, but they are not bullet-proof either. You will have to think your way through the season, and we know that Nico Rosberg is strong at that. You need to be acrobatic to tame these cars because they have a lot of torque and power and that is where Lewis Hamilton is strong, so I seem them both being contenders.

The two teams who with the best chance of evolving more quickly are Mercedes and Ferrari because they are developing the engines, so Hamilton and Rosberg and the Ferrari pair of Fernando Alonso and Kimi Riakkonen should have an advantage by mid-season.

Sorely missed: Jenson Button (centre) will be without his dad John (left) in the paddock who died in January

Professional: Brundle believes Button (pictured) will focus on the track despite the loss of his father

Over at McLaren, Jenson Button will feel the passing of his father John most strongly at the first race because he has been part and parcel of his racing career, but Button is a professional. He will get in the car and he will switch all of that off.

As a grand prix driver you are quite selfish. Whether you have just had kids or whatever, when you turn up you get on and do the job. You have hundreds of people working for you and you’re the final link in the chain so you have to get the job done and that is exactly what Button will do.

But who do I believe will win the world championship? I would not write off Sebastian Vettel like a lot of people have done, but he has a tall order there. I fancy Hamilton to win his second title.

Sky Sports F1 is the only place to watch all 19 Grands Prix weekends live on TV, Sky Go and Now TV.
