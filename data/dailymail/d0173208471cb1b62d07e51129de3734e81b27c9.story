Arjen Robben's 100th competitive goal for undefeated Bayern Munich extended their  lead at the top of the Bundesliga table to 12 points during a routine win over SC Freiburg.

The Dutchman's header in the 41st minute gave Bayern a deserved lead, before Thomas Muller doubled their advantage  during their 11th win in 12 league games.

Even Manuel Neuer was up to his old tricks, caught standing near the half-way line, while Pep Guardiola's men set a new Bundesliga record, having conceded just three goals after 16 matches.

Losing Xabi Alonso and Mehdi Benatia midway through the match due to injury was a blow, but it did little to stop them ripping through Freiburg. 

In fact, the visitors did not muster a shot until the 75th minute.

Neuer and Bayern's clean sheet means they have now got a better record than VfB Stuttgart's efforts from 2003. It was  never in doubt.

Bayern held 82 per cent possession and Freiburg goalkeeper Roman Burki, in all fairness, did well to not  concede before the 41st minute.

He denied Mario Gotze what seemed a sure thing before Robben eventually beat him.

The opening goal itself appeared simple. An Alonso chipped ball found Franck Ribery lying in wait at the back, who in turn nodded to a free Robben.

The Dutchman was never going to miss, ducking low to head into the empty net for a 1-0 lead.

Muller hit the post before half time, but wasn't to rue that missed opportunity for long. 

He made amends in the 48th minute with a brave header while under pressure that saw him get Bayern's second during a comfortable win.

It could have been by a far larger margin had it not been for goalkeeper Burki, who repeatedly denied Bayern during their 31 attempts on goal.

Afterwards, Bayern players held a banner that read 'Thank you! You are great!', and a quite incredible laser show followed.
