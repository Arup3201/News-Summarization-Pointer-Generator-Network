Retired headmaster John Regan was told that he would have to wait a day and a half before his complaint about his bins not being collected would be heard

All he wanted was for his rubbish to be taken away so when the binmen were four days late John Regan decided to find out why.

The retired headteacher picked up the phone and called Winchester City Council helpline hoping for a swift answer to his query.

But the taped message the 60-year-old father of two received stunned him. He was 'in a 37-hour queue'.

Exasperated and, unsurprisingly, not prepared to wait a day and a half for an answer he then called the council's main number, only to be diverted to Hampshire County Council switchboard.

Today his rubbish bins had still not been collected, seven days after they were meant to be emptied.

Mr Regan, from Winchester, said: 'I just want my rubbish collected. What is so difficult about emptying my bin?

He added: 'I rang Winchester council after four days and I was told I was in a 37-hour queue.

'I thought this was ridiculous so I rang their main number but I was then diverted to the county council where the operator said the city council number was overloaded.

'I am increasingly exasperated. We are in the country so there is a potential vermin. It is also unsightly. I just want my rubbish collected.

'In any sort of business you would not be tolerate being treated like this.'

Winchester Council today admitted it had received a staggering 4,000 queries about the new waste collection service it had introduced with East Hampshire Council using the contractor BIFFA. Of that number 558 about bins not being emptied.

A Winchester City Council spokesman said: 'We had an issue with our telephone system which was telling people there was a 37-hour wait but nobody waited more than 30 minutes.

'We have his case as a missed bin. BIFFA is now going around doing additional collections.'
