'Gross abuse of power': PC Edward Prince was convicted of assault

A police officer who kicked an illegal immigrant in the head as though he was 'kicking a football' was jailed for 18 months today.

Pc Edward Prince, 31, attacked Trinidadian victim Nyrone Games, 27, in an act of 'thoughtless naked aggression' as colleagues pinned him face down on the pavement.

The plainclothes officer told Mr Games he would have suffered much worse treatment if the event had not been captured on CCTV, saying 'You would have got a good kicking. You well deserved what you got.'

Today, Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC jailed him for his 'gross abuse of power and breach of trust.'

Eye witnesses described seeing blood splattered across the victim's face and on the ground beneath his head after the assault.

Prince denied deliberately kicking Mr Games in the head during an arrest and said he was only following orders to restrain the man.

But a jury at Southwark Crown Court convicted Prince of assault occasioning actual bodily harm after rejecting his claims.

Prince had been part of a group of officers who had chased the suspect through the streets of Croydon, south London, on November 6, 2009.

Mr Games, originally from Trinidad, was wanted for deportation after being jailed in 2007 for a string of drug related offences.

Jurors heard that Prince had been traced to an address in Croydon by officers with a warrant for his arrest, but fled the property.

He was chased through the streets to Brighton Road where he was surrounded and hauled to the ground outside an Esso petrol station.

During the melee Prince kicked him in the head with his right foot, said prosecutor Sam Brown.

'At this point Pc Tina Bassett saw one of the officers run up to where Nyrone Games was lying on the ground, run straight up to the top of his body, move his right leg back and kicked Nyrone Games in his head area,' he said.

Denial: Prince told the court he did not deliberately kick Mr Games

'[A second officer] also saw an officer performing a kicking action but was obstructed from seeing what he was kicking.

'Both officers saw blood on Nyrone Games' face and the pavement underneath his head.

'It was observed from what they saw of his demeanour that he was angry and in pain. 

'The actions of this defendant were thoughtless, naked aggression in the course of a melee the circumstances of which he thought would conceal his actions.'

Giving evidence against her colleague, Pc Tina Bassett had told jurors how she saw four officers restraining Mr Games when a plainclothes officer ran over and kicked him in the head. 

She said: 'I would describe it as kicking a football with some force.'I could not believe what I saw. 

'What I saw was completely against all ethics of being a police officer.'

Giving evidence Prince said he had joined in the pursuit of Mr Games and had watched as an officer from Lewisham intercepted Mr Games and hit him round the legs with a baton.

He said his colleague Pc Gavin McSweeney then grabbed hold of Mr Game's upper body and hauled him to the floor outside the Esso garage.

When asked to describe what happened next by his barrister Elroy Claxton he said: 'As I ran around Mr Games Pc McSweeny shouted to me to get his head.

'My reaction was he is the first one there, he knows what he is talking about, I need to go down and secure the head.

'[Mr Games] was struggling to get away. It was still a violent struggle.

'Mr Games was a strong, very well-built, young man, determined to get away from police officers.

'I put my left hand on his left shoulder and put my weight on him so that he could not try and get up.'

'Your actions amounted to an extremely grave breach of your public duty and a gross breach of the public's trust'

Mr Claxton asked him: 'Did you at any stage kick Mr Games?'

Prince, who joined the force nine and a half years ago, replied: 'No, at no point did I deliberately kick Mr Games.

'It is a possibility I may have come into contact with Mr Games, but as I say it was not a deliberate act.'

Prince, of Crawley, west Sussex, denied causing actual bodily harm.

Mr Games was deported back to Trinidad in March 2010. 

Judge Pegden said: 'In my judgement you also hit the prone man with your radio, which was in your hand.

'You also, in my judgement, provoked the restrained man.

'By your actions you caused this man's face to bleed profusely.

'You caused him cuts and grazes to his face and a swollen and blackened left eye.

'Your actions amounted to an extremely grave breach of you public duty and a gross breach of the public's trust.

'The public are entitled to expect that their police force to behave lawfully and not use gratuitous and serious violence on someone who is already restrained and prone.

'This was a gross abuse of power and breach of trust carried out in broad daylight in front of your colleagues and members of the public causing them outrage, shock, disgust and disbelief.'
