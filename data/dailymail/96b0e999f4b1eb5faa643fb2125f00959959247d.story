A care worker who scooped £1 million on the lottery told today she bought the lucky scratch card in desperation - after discovering she was down to her last £20.

Bride-to-be Jackie Murphy won the bumper payout on a Millionaire 777s scratch card on August 23 after finished a 12-hour minimum-wage shift.

The shopper had just £11.52 in her bank account when she took a punt and spent £5 of the £10 note she had in her pocket on the lucky scratch card.

And she said she hasn't stopped beaming since scooping the jackpot, but won't let the money change her life.

The 61-year-old, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, is to wed fiance John Potter next month.

But the thrifty pair say their new found riches wont change their marital plans as her bridesmaids will accompany her down the isle in dresses from Matalan. 

Ms Murphy, who bought the scratch card from News Express in their home town, said: 'You cannot change the habits of a lifetime.

'I earn the minimum wage as a carer. It takes me an hour to earn gross the cost of the scratchcard so it isn't something I buy frequently. I don't know why I decided to last Saturday.

'We won't be splashing out on things but we will be able to be a bit more secure.

'At first I thought, well if I don't win anything at least I will get my fiver back as that is a given on the Millionaire 777s.

'But when I saw I had won £1 million I just could not believe it. I had to sit down and take a deep breath.

'I decided to buy a scratchcard on Saturday afternoon from News Express in Shawbury.

'I got back in to the car, scratched it and just sat there in disbelief before dashing back in to the store to get it checked.

'I gave it to the shop assistant who scanned it for me before asking her if it was really worth £1 million.

'Her smile got bigger, before she said it was worth a million at which point I started to get a bit weak at the knees.

'The store manager and another chap who was fixing the phone lines at the shop helped me in to the office before the manager phoned the National Lottery for me.

'We couldn't immediately confirm all the details, but it didn't take too much longer to get the amazing news that I was indeed a millionaire.

'I asked my fiance to come home as soon as possible but he said he couldn't as he hadn't patched the hole in the roof.

'I told him I had won £1 million but he didn't believe me.

'I then panicked because I thought about the fact he was on a roof and asked the shop manager to speak to him. Needless to say everything was fine.

'Since winning on Saturday we have both lost about half a stone each in weight as we have just been too excited to eat.'

The couple, who have been together for 10 years, had been busily preparing for their wedding next month prior to the win.

The couple have said that their good fortune will not change them, apart from driving a new Peugeot sports car

Her mother, Alma Green, 89, had bought Ms Murphy's wedding dress in the Monsoon sale, her shoes are from Tesco and the bridesmaids will be wearing dresses from Matalan.

They will be getting wed at a registry office with a reception held at a nearby hotel and they are not changing their plans for the wedding - apart from a free bar for all the guests.

Ms Murphy, who has splurged on a new £25,000 Peugeot RCZ sportscar, added: 'I have really enjoyed organising the wedding.

'I know that what we have organised will be wonderful so why change it just because we have won this money?

'I have decided to splash out on wedding flowers and posies and balloons which I wasn't going to have but that and the free bar is all that has changed.'

The couple, who were presented with their winning cheque in front of friends and family including John's daughter Katie, 28, and son Joe, 24 , and Jackie's sons Carl, 41, and Steven, 39, at the Albrighton Hall Hotel, near Shrewsbury, had saved tirelessly over the past few months but haven't booked a honeymoon prior to the win as they could not afford one.
