As the tremors from Grigor Dimitrov’s earth-shattering defeat of Andy Murray began to fade on Thursday, we were left to wonder whether the tectonic plates of men’s tennis still had further to shift.

Can this 23-year-old Bulgarian break new ground and beat another one of the Big Four?

Novak Djokovic will hope the answer is no on Friday and the Serb certainly has experience on his side.

In control: Dimitov started far faster than Murray and never looked like letting his early lead slip

While this is Dimitrov’s debut in a Grand Slam semi-final, Djokovic has been in 23, winning on 13 occasions.

He lifted the title here in 2011, entered the tournament as No 1 seed, and has career earnings topping $62million, essentially everything to which Dimitrov aspires.

Such gold and silver might not be far away.

The Murray win cemented Dimitrov’s status from promising youth to serious contender, following on from his victory at Queen’s last month.

He is laying foundations and toppling Djokovic will add another level.

Dimitrov’s respected coach Roger Rasheed said: ‘He’s got more than a chance. I’ve got no ceiling on what Grigor can do.

‘What a great challenge it is for him, but also for Novak. He is not going to walk out on court thinking he’s got this semi-final in the bag. We’re expecting a match of high intensity with a lot of good quality tennis.’

Dimitrov’s rise can be traced back to the appointment of Rasheed last October and the coach  added: ‘At the start we spoke about how I was going to navigate him through a Grand Slam.

‘It’s about how you treat these off-days. During our practice sessions there are a few little things we pick up on. The rest is about being fresh and letting  your mind recover ready for the battle.’

Djokovic leads Dimitrov 3-1 in previous encounters, winning their last one in straight sets at the French Open in 2013. But Djokovic knows that the player he faces today is a different proposition.

‘His game has improved a lot,’ said the five-times major champion. ‘The fact that he hasn’t lost a match in the grasscourt season this year says enough about his quality — also winning against Andy.

‘I’m sure many people look at him as a potential Grand Slam winner. Maybe here, maybe in the Grand Slams to follow.’
