'It's no big deal': Nigel Farage,  standing for next year's Parliament on a no-unskilled-foreigners ticket, has never revealed his German ancestry

The voters of South Thanet will decide whether Nigel Farage becomes a force in Westminster politics  or remains on the periphery.

Yet, despite a host of interviews over the past decade and a supposedly tell-all autobiography, Nigel Farage has yet to give them a full account of himself.

For while it is well known that Mr Farage’s wife Kirsten is German, the Ukip leader – standing for next year’s Parliament on a no-unskilled-foreigners ticket – is yet to admit in public that he himself is the descendant of immigrants.

Today, a Mail on Sunday investigation can reveal that Mr Farage’s grandmother, born Gladys Schrod, descends from German immigrants who fled to Britain in search of work and a better way of life.

It’s a secret he has kept close to his chest ever since his election to Ukip’s leadership in 2006.

In the many interviews the party leader has given in the past decade, he has never referred to his German ancestry. Neither do his ancestors rate a mention in his self-congratulatory memoirs Flying Free.

Indeed, in the book he refers to his grandmother Gladys Schrod as having ‘Georgette Heyer-style aspirations’, apparently all very English, all very decorous.

But in their three-bed semi in Beckenham, Kent, Gladys’s father and Mr Farage’s great-grandfather, Carl Schrod, a lowly Post Office sorter, is unlikely to have encouraged the upper-crust tales dispensed by Miss Heyer.

He’d grown up the hard way, living in rented rooms in the German quarter of  London behind Tottenham Court Road – an area awash with refugees and prostitutes.

Last year, in a confrontation with BBC political editor Nick Robinson, Mr Farage had the opportunity to set the record straight. Robinson drew attention to the fact that the politician’s second wife, Kirsten, was born in Hamburg.

Why, Robinson asked, did Mr Farage give the job of secretary to a German when it could have gone to a Brit?

Mr Farage insisted that ‘nobody else could do that job’, which included checking emails for him at midnight. He might have added: ‘Germans are very hard-working, as I should know – my people come from Frankfurt.’

But he did not. So today, we supply the missing piece of the jigsaw which makes up the Nigel Farage story – the German connection.

During the middle part of the 19th Century, emigration was a popular option among those who lived in the federation of German states (Germany did not become a country until 1871). Religious persecution, a sharp economic downturn and rising land prices were driving Germans from their homeland.

Crowded: Immigrants fight for space in a rundown area of London in the late 19th Century. What Nikolaus Schrod would have made of his great-great-grandson's 'keep them out' rallying cry, one can only guess

Millions went to America, while others saw their future here. Nikolaus Schrod, Mr Farage’s great-great grandfather, was a young cabinet-maker in Frankfurt. He married his sweetheart Bina at 21, but before starting a family he decided his shaky prospects would be much improved by moving to England.

It was the 1850s, a time of rapid expansion and a new prosperity fuelled by the Industrial Revolution. Britain, then as now, was the land of promise. However, the benefits system had not been invented and those who fled to these shores came in the hope of a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay.

Panikos Panayi, professor of European History at De Montfort University and a leading expert on German migration, points to the large number of German musicians who’d recently moved to London, bringing with them a wider appreciation of classical music and encouraging a broader culture among the educated classes. Their presence added a new zest to the capital’s cultural life.

Nikolaus Schrod made the cases  for the pianos, upright and grand, which were becoming a must-have status symbol in every fashionable drawing-room, while Bina brought in  extra money as a needlewoman and dressmaker.

They lived in rented rooms in the teeming tenements close to the city’s heart – close enough to the rich who employed them, but a world away.

Existing on a minimum wage and living in near-poverty, both were skilled workers making a positive contribution to the life and comfort of the social classes above them.

‘The British Government of the day was operating what was effectively an open-door policy on immigrants,’ says Prof Panayi. ‘And though many Germans who came to London in  the mid-19th Century were largely ignored, these people [the Schrods] were skilled and will have been more positively received.’

What Nikolaus Schrod would have made of his great-great-grandson’s ‘keep them out’ rallying cry, one can only guess. After all, he and Bina came to Britain with no paper qualifications – in Nigel Farage’s future Britain, they would be turned away.

Yet in his short life – he died before his 45th birthday – Nikolaus was a model of what foreign labour can do to add to the wealth of the nation. He was no Roma camping on the streets but a man who worked so hard to make a new life for his family it sent him to an early grave.

His only child, Carl, left school at 14 to become a telegraph messenger with the General Post Office. Carl later changed his name to Charles and married an English girl, Ellen Abbott.

The Anglicisation of the family was completed in the next generation when their daughter Gladys married a young stockbroker’s clerk, Harry Farage.

It would appear, the family was always determined to improve itself – never  asking for help, never expecting it.

Harry was the first white-collar worker in what was to become a relatively posh family. By the next generation the Farages had found out how to make money in the City and went about it with gusto.

Both sides of the family – Schrods and Farages – are a proud illustration of how a flexible labour market can reward both the labourer and the country as a whole.

But Nigel Farage seems determined to deny the past in his juggernaut journey to fame. In May at the launch of the Euro election campaign in Yorkshire, he derided the ‘mass’ of people ‘coming in and flooding the lower ends of the labour market in Britain’ – doing, in fact, what his ancestors the Schrods had done.

And – come to that – the Farages had done too.

The surname Farage, according to its owner, is of Huguenot origin. The Huguenots were members of the protestant church in France who fled in their tens of thousands from religious persecution.

As many as 500,000 left the country in the late 16th and early 17th Centuries, many of them settling in Britain.

As with the Schrods, the Farages found no border controls, no Government immigration policy, no racial or religious prejudice – nothing, in fact, but a peaceful country which welcomed them and encouraged them to work and make the best of their lives. They did not  need to bring with them sheets of paper  listing their qualifications.

When told that The Mail on Sunday planned to publish an article on his  German ancestry, Mr Farage, said: ‘I’ve never made any secret of a variety of  European links of the original derivation of my surname.’

However, he admitted he had failed to mention his German ancestors on his mother’s side, despite being questioned on  a regular basis about his German wife.

‘No, I haven’t,’ he said. ‘There’s no reason why I should, is there? Yes, it is true that  my great-great-grandfather was of  Germanic origin but he didn’t come from Germany. Because when he came to the UK, Germany [as a single state] didn’t even exist.’ He added: ‘On the basis of that, I’m one-32nd German.

‘I have a great-great-grandfather of Germanic origin. This is true. I don’t regard it as a particularly big deal.’

The headline of an earlier version of this article referred to Mr Farage’s great grandfather. This has now been amended to indicate it is his great-great grandfather. The family tree that we published also incorrectly stated that Mr Farage’s mother was Carole Hyatt, his father’s second wife rather than Barbara Stevens, his father’s first wife. We have apologised for these mistakes.
