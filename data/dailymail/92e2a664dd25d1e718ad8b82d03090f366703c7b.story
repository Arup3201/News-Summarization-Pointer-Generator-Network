Crowd trouble marred Castleford's moment of glory as they swept into their first Challenge Cup final since 1992 with a convincing defeat of Widnes.

Disgruntled Vikings supporters invaded the pitch at Leigh Sports Village after the final hooter and approached rival fans at the opposite end in a provocative manner.

Some violence did break out as police and stewards attempted to quell the disturbance.

When the pitch was eventually cleared 
the Castleford players did return to pay tribute to their fans - but by 
then the heavy rain which had affected much of the game had returned.

It is not the first time Widnes fans have caused trouble in recent years with problems during games at Wakefield and Warrington.

Vikings chief executive James Rule declined to comment on the latest problems.

In
 terms of the match action, Widnes supporters had been given little to 
cheer as Castleford ran in five tries to book a Wembley date with their 
rivals Leeds.

Tries from 
Liam Finn and Daryl Clark in the opening nine minutes set the tone and 
further scores from Kirk Dixon, Jamie Ellis and Jake Webster put the 
result beyond doubt.

Widnes mustered just one consolation try late on from Jack Owens.

Before
 the end the Castleford fans in the sold-out 12,005 crowd had been 
shouting, 'Bring on the Rhinos' - a match that will have extra poignancy
 for Tigers coach Daryl Powell.

Powell,
 who has led a remarkable revival of Cas over the past year, was a 
member of the last Leeds side to win the Challenge Cup in 1999 and later
 had a spell coaching the Rhinos.

The game was scrappy at times, but Powell's men always had the upper hand.

The
 combinations between the key quartet of four-goal Marc Sneyd, Finn, 
Luke Dorn and Clark were superior to anything Widnes offered.

The
 writing was on the wall after five minutes as the influential Clark 
found Dorn and his pass enabled Finn to burst through the line and race 
clear.

The early blast 
continued and Cas claimed a second try as Clark ran from dummy half and 
exchanged passes with Sneyd to touch down in the corner.

Widnes
 might have conceded a third soon after as Dixon pounced following a 
high kick by Finn but video referee Phil Bentham spotted a touch from 
Webster in the build-up.

Castleford's
 charge was tempered when prop Craig Huby was forced off with what was 
later confirmed as a dislocated elbow following a clash with team-mate 
Nathan Massey.

Widnes 
finally produced a meaningful attack after 25 minutes as Chris Dean 
drove close to the line but Frankie Mariano led a swift Tigers 
counter-attack.

Dixon 
increased the Widnes misery as he stepped inside from the right 
touchline to beat the last defender and score a third try after good 
handling from Mariano and Dorn.

Danny
 Tickle drove Widnes to within inches of the line as they looked to 
respond just before the hooter but he could not hold on.

Breakaway: Liam Finn races clear before going over for another try 

Castleford
 tightened their grip after the break and put the game beyond Widnes as 
former Leigh player Ellis, back on his old ground, darted through from 
dummy half.

After that 
Castleford just needed to play out time. Sneyd added a penalty and 
Widnes efforts to fight back were thwarted when Stefan Marsh had a try 
disallowed by the video referee.

Webster
 found his way over to put the seal on victory for the Tigers but the 
Vikings pulled one back at the close when Owens touched down in the 
corner, converting his own score.

The
 final hooter should have prompted joyous scenes for Castleford, but 
their celebrations were quickly overshadowed as trouble broke out.
