Swiss drug-maker Novartis has started supplying a new meningitis B vaccine to thousands of Princeton University students in an effort to stop an outbreak at the Ivy League campus, despite the shot not yet licensed for use in the United States.

The vaccine - which is called Bexsero and is available in Europe, Australia and Canada - has been imported in and will be administered to a total of about 5000 undergraduate students and 550 graduate students in dorms at the New Jersey campus this week after receiving permission from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The green light follows eight university students being diagnosed with the serogroup B strain of meningitis, a potentially fatal infection that causes swelling of the brain and spinal cord and can kill within 24 hours.

A meningitis vaccine approved for use in Europe and Australia but not in the United States has been imported to try and stop an outbreak of the disease at Princeton University in New Jersey, federal health officials have said

Across the country, at the University of California in Santa Barbara, at least four students have been reported as infected by meningitis B in the past month, including an 18-year-old freshman lacrosse player whose feet had to be amputated after complications from the illness.

Aaron Loy is recovering slowly following the drastic surgery.

'His overall body and various wounds continue to heal with his daily regimen of nutrition, therapy and rest,' his family said on Friday.

'His next surgery is scheduled for early next week. Aaron’s spirits and commitment to return to UCSB are remarkable.'

Other students who were hospitalized are recovering, health officials at both Princeton and UCSB told NBC News, without divulging details.

Loy’s condition underscores the threat of meningitis infections, which are rare but very serious — especially among teens and young adults — killing 1 in 10 of those affected and leaving about 20 percent of those who survive with severe disabilities, including limb loss, deafness and mental retardation.

The infection is spread through coughing and exchanges of saliva, and people living in dormitories or other crowded living quarters are especially at risk.

Young adults and individuals with certain medical conditions have an increased risk of meningitis, especially when living in close proximity to one another.

Meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges.

Infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes this inflammation, according to the CDC.

The first dose of the Princeton vaccine will be available this week; a second dose in February.

For maximum protection, individuals must receive two doses.

Princeton have said they will cover the cost of the vaccine.

Novartis has completed Phase I and Phase II trials for the vaccine in the United States and is in discussions with regulators about the path to approval.

The drug-maker is hoping Bexsero will turn around its vaccine business, which has lost money to research and spending cash in the first nine months of the year.

In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States, according to the CDC.

Of those, 160 were group B.
