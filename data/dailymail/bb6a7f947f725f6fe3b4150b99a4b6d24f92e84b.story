Purely for medicinal purposes... Cleo the American Staffordshire pup was treated with a bottle and a half of vodka to cure her antifreeze poisoning

A 10-week-old puppy in danger of dying from poisoning after swallowing anti-freeze was saved by a strong dose of vodka – a whole bottle and a half!

A vet put Cleo, an American Staffordshire, on the emergency hard liquor treatment as an antidote and the unusual treatment saved her life.

She was today still getting over a hangover in a Melbourne veterinary surgery, but her owner, Miss Stacey Zammit was delighted that her four-legged friend was on the road to recovery.

Cleo fell gravely ill after licking deadly radiator fluid ethylene glycol off spare car parts in a garage. Within half an hour she was swaying, rejecting food and at serious risk of death from kidney failure.

Miss Zammit, from the Melbourne suburb of Truganina, rushed Cleo, a Christmas present, to the vet, who realised the dog was just a few hours away from total renal failure.

By chance, the vet had a bottle of vodka, which was also a Christmas gift, handy and Cleo was immediately hooked up to the liquor, Melbourne’s Herald Sun newspaper reported.

‘The next time I saw her (the vet) I asked if she was wasted – drunk – and the vet was like “Yeah!”,’ said 27-year-old Miss Zammit.

‘Cleo had really bloodshot eyes and she was pretty unsteady. She couldn’t move around much because she was so wasted.’

Her wobbly condition was not surprising - she had been given vodka every six hours for two days through a tube in her nose.

In less than 72 hours she had consumed almost a bottle and a half.

An American Staffordshire terrier, like Cleo: Although the puppy was left unsteady on her feet and with bloodshot eyes, the treatment successfully halted the chemical reaction that would have led to renal failure

Vet Dr Yenny Indrawirawan said the ‘hair of the dog’ treatment was rare but effective.

‘The alcohol stops a chemical reaction in the body,’ Dr Indrawirawan said. ‘Without the vodka Cleo was likely to develop renal failure.’

Miss Zammit said the pup had just about beaten her hangover the same way that humans do – trying to ignore it.

‘She slept a lot and she was eating a lot, but she seems really happy now,’ said Miss Zammit.
