A canoeist watches as the sun rises over mist in the Norfolk Broads; a child dips her toes in a lock in the Cairngorms; and a walker looks out over the winter landscape of the Peak District.

These stunning photographs were some of the finalists in a competition celebrating the natural beauty of Britain's 15 national parks. More than 300 images - all taken inside one of the parks - were entered into the competition.

The winner, a photo of a canoeist as she paddles through Surlingham Broad, in the Norfolk Broads, at sunrise, was taken by amateur photographer Fraser Johnston. He said: 'It's a beautiful memory of a beautiful morning setting off in the canoe after camping the night before.

'The position the shot is taken from puts the viewer right in the action, taking the stern position in the canoe.' It was chosen by Ben Fogle, the television presenter.

He said: 'It's evocative and moving. A beautiful scene that makes you want to dive into the image. I find it surprisingly moving and breathtakingly beautiful. Canoeing is accessible to everyone. It requires no expertise. And, just like the National Parks, it's for everyone.'

Kathryn Cook, UK Director of the UK Association of National Park Authorities, who helped pick the final shortlist, added: 'We were really taken with the quality of this year's entries and there were some lively discussions among the judges about who should go through.

'Each of the photos so wonderfully represented what is special about the UK's National Parks - that they are free and open to all of us.'

This image by James Grant of a walker standing on the edges of Kinder Scout in the Peak District - Derbyshire's highest point - was one of the finalists in the competition

Another finalist was this photograph, taken by Sarah Caird, showing her daughter enjoying her first paddle in Loch an Eilein, in the Cairngorms

Chris Mole took this image - one of the finalists - of walkers in silhouette on the cliffs near the lighthouse at Beachy Head, in the South Downs

Andy Curtis' photograph of a walker on Bamford Edge in the Peak District - overlooking Ladybower Reservoir - was a finalist in the competition

Another of the finalists in the competition was Steve Glover's picture of a man climbing Kilnsey Crag - a limescale cliff in the Yorkshire Dales

Amateur photographer Fraser is originally from Tasmania in Australia, but moved to Norwich in 2007 to be with his girlfriend who he met whilst she was on holiday in Tasmania.

He said: 'At the time I didn't even know Norfolk existed. It's much different to Tasmania where there is barely a flat piece of ground anywhere. However I learned to love the landscape especially after we bought an old hand-made canoe.

This panoramic image called Miners' Path up Snowdon - taken in Snowdonia by Mark Wheeler - was another finalist in the compeition

'About this time I took up photography and we started exploring the Broads, putting a tent and some warm clothes in our leaky old canoe and setting off from Norwich, headed down river for the weekend.'

The competition, entitled Actively Yours, promotes this year's National Parks Week, from July 29 to August 4, where people are encouraged to get out and about, be it walking, horse riding, canoeing, rock climbing or cycling in one of the UK's 15 national parks.
