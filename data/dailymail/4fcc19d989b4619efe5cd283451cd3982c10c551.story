A suburban Denver woman had the ride of a lifetime after a goose smashed through her windshield.

Shannon Jergenson, of Golden, was driving to work on a local highway when the large bird tried to fly away but instead ended up inside her car. She miraculously escaped without any serious injury.

‘The bird came up and just went 'bam,' right into my windshield,’ she told CBS Denver.

Goosed: The large bird died immediately upon impact

Startled: Shannon Jergenson says she's lucky she only suffered a minor cut to the side of her face

The windshield shattered as the bird went through it, Jergenson told the station, she had to turn her head to stop glass shards from hitting her face.

‘I could barely see because the windshield was mangled,’ she added.

The woman said she was only doing 50mph when she struck the goose. 

Shocking photos taken by the woman were posted to Facebook later in the day.

The bird was impaled on her steering wheel immediately upon impact.

‘I turned my head and when I opened my eyes the bird was... its head just kind of fell over,’ the hairdresser recalled.

The woman slowed down and pulled over to the side of the road to call for help.

Jergenson was unaware of the glass in her hair, and did not realize how much was there until later in the day when the shock wore off.

‘I took my hair down and could just hear the glass falling,’ she said.

She luckily only has a small cut on the side of her face as a result of the horror crash. The goose was not as lucky, the crash immediately killed it.

Glass was also all over her car as well, it took her several hours to vacuum it out, she wrote on Facebook.

Several friends were in disbelief over the mishap.

‘I cant understand how that thing went through your windshield,’ one wrote on Facebook.

Many more said they were glad she was okay, but one poked fun of the incident.

‘Shannon got goosed,’ he wrote.

Local authorities said they had never seen anything like it.
