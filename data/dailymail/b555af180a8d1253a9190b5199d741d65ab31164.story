Top earner: The SNP have voted to make Nicola Sturgeon the best-paid politician in Britain

The Scottish National Party has voted to make Nicola Sturgeon the best-paid politician in Britain.

The Scottish Parliament, which is controlled by the SNP, rubber-stamped a pay rise for all its members that takes Miss Sturgeon’s official salary to £144,687 a year.

Her pay is now well above David Cameron’s £142,500 earnings as well as the £143,911 that Boris Johnson is paid for his role as Mayor of London.

Aides to the First Minister sensed a looming PR disaster and have insisted she would not take her salary in full.

The row follows the Scottish Parliament’s vote on a 0.7 per cent salary rise yesterday.

The move – which was passed unopposed – increases the First Minister’s official salary by just over £1,000 to £144,687.

MSPs are currently paid 87.5 per cent of an MP’s salary, a figure that reflects their lesser responsibilities. 

But they voted to break that link, saying it was because they could not accept a 10 per cent pay rise mooted for MPs after the election.

However, the move means that MSPs’ wages will rise by 0.7 per cent to £59,089 on April 1.

Miss Sturgeon will earn more than any other politician despite having no control of defence or foreign affairs, and only limited say on issues such as tax and benefits. Critics pointed out that she only serves about five million people, compared to 64million served by Mr Cameron.

Her aides said that she would actually draw a more modest salary of £135,605.

But Tory MPs accused the SNP of treating voters in the rest of the country with contempt. Brian Binley said Miss Sturgeon should pay for any MSPs’ pay rise by levying taxes in Scotland.

Mr Binley added: ‘Sadly, I’m not surprised by this. Every person living in Scotland already gets far more spent on them than my constituents in England, and it’s no surprise to see SNP politicians wanting their share of it.

‘If people in Scotland want to pay for Nicola Sturgeon and her MSPs then that would be one thing – but it is taxpayers in England who are picking up the bill for the SNP’s profligacy.

‘People in my constituency are sick to death of being asked to pay up so that Scots can have more spent on them.

Nicola Sturgeon's pay is now well above David Cameron’s £142,500 earnings - even though she only serves about five million people

‘They are also sick to death of seeing the SNP, who wanted out of this nation six months ago, now wanting to run the country.’

Fellow Tory Charlie Elphicke said the pay rise underlined the threat posed by the SNP.

‘This is a harbinger of what the SNP would do if they ever got into government,’ he said. ‘We would get more spending, more borrowing and a total lack of restraint.

‘Nicola Sturgeon is obviously not worth more than David Cameron – the idea is laughable. But the SNP have no appreciation of the struggle faced by millions of people who work hard, pay their taxes and do their best to make ends meet. It’s all someone else’s money to them.’

On Monday, Miss Sturgeon made a speech in London in which she vowed to work with Labour to ‘lock the Tories’ out of power. She insisted voters would welcome her influence as a way to end austerity policies.

Nicola Sturgeon's pay is also above the £143,911 that Boris Johnson is paid for his role as Mayor of London.

The pay row came as Labour’s leader in Scotland claimed that the funding deal under which Scotland receives more than its fair share of cash for public services would be made ‘permanent’ if Labour wins power.

The so-called Barnett Formula means that public spending per head in England stands at just £8,529, compared to a staggering £10,152 in Scotland.

Tory MPs – and many Labour MPs in England – want the formula to be scrapped as part of any deal to give Scotland additional powers.

But Jim Murphy said: ‘The Labour Party view is that the Barnett Formula is permanent – it is here to stay.’

And he added: ‘Abolishing the Barnett Formula would be a form of maximum austerity that Scotland has never seen the like of before.’
