You would never know by looking at the lively and cheeky toddler - now 16-months-old - that he was so close to death just seven months ago.

But when Leo Lever was nine-months-old he swallowed a button battery in the family's inner-west Sydney home in April which had attached to his oesophagus for six days before finally being discovered on the third visit to the hospital.

The little tacker had eroded an astounding one third of his oesophagus and had to spend eight days in an induced coma and a further six weeks being tube fed through his nose when he made a miraculous full recovery.

Leo Lever was put into an induced coma for eight days with no certainty of full recovery

The nine-month-old swallowed a button battery which was discovered six days later on the third hospital visit 

You would never know by looking at the lively and cheeky toddler - now 16-months-old - that was he so close to death just seven months ago

As soon as the x-ray revealed the round foreign object, his mother, Francesca Lever, immediately realised what had happened.

Her husband, Stewart, had changed his bike helmet battery light and their eldest son, Lachie, 3, had climbed on to the bench and must have knocked it off onto the floor.

'Leo is a little vacuum cleaner,' his mother Francesca quipped who was unaware of what had happened at the time.

'He started crying out of the blue and was really distressed for the rest of the night,' she said. 

'He was also vomiting but he was already unwell that week with a fever so I just thought it was part of that.'

Leo was tube fed for three weeks in the ward and another three weeks when he went home

It wasn't until Leo's breathing changed that his parents took him to hospital with staff treating him for croup on the first two visits.

But when the little fella didn't improve, Francesca went back to the hospital and requested an x-ray and Leo was rushed into emergency surgery within 25 minutes. 

'I still had no idea what was in store or how severe it was,' she recalls.

'It was a crazy time - I still can't believe we made it through.' 

Being so young, Leo needed to be sedated so he could remain still in order to heal and was therefore put into an induced coma for eight days.

He then spent another three days in intensive care and a further three weeks in a ward before going home where he was tube fed at home for another three weeks. 

Sydney Children’s Hospital’s ear, nose and throat specialist, Ian Jacobson, told Francesca that he had no idea of the prognosis as it 'was the worst damage he had seen.' 

A third of Leo's oesophagus had eroded but it completely healed about two months later

His mother described Leo as a 'robust little guy' who was a 'loving, friendly and outgoing character'

However, six weeks after leaving hospital, his follow-up procedure showed that his oesophagus had completely healed.

'The staff were amazed he survived six days with the battery inside him - one more day and it may have been different,' she said.

Francesca believed that her son's character had a lot to do with the incredible recovery.

'He's a really robust little guy - nine out of 10 kids probably would have died but he has a real fight about him,' she said. ' He was jumping up and down on the bed 10 minutes before going into surgery.'

She said she still finds it hard to believe that such a small object could have been lethal.

'I had no idea it was such a hazard,' she said. 

'If it was a coin it would have obstructed and he would have choked - or it would have passed through - but because of the charge of the battery it attached itself to the oesophagus and started to erode.'

'It's good to spread the word because I didn't know such a tiny shiny thing could be such a danger.'

Francesca still can't believe her family made it through the trauma
