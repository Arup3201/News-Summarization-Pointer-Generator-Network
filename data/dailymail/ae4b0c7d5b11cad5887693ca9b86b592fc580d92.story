Ian Holloway blasted referee Stuart Attwell for failing to award Millwall a penalty as his side lost at home to Bolton.

Darren Pratley scored the only goal of the game as Bolton extended their unbeaten run to seven games.

But Holloway was left fuming as Attwell turned down Millwall’s calls for a spot-kick when striker Lee Gregory was brought down by keeper Andy Lonergan when through on goal early in the second half.

The former Chelsea striker looked to threaten David Forde's goal but couldn't open his second account 

Holloway said: ‘If that is not a foul and a penalty and a red card then I don’t know what is.

‘Book my man for diving or send the keeper off and award a penalty. Make a decision. Don’t just wave play on. The fourth official saw it and how the referee missed it I don't know.

‘But I am also fuming because of our play. The game should have been 0-0, we got a free kick and we didn't take it in the right way and they went and scored at the other end. If we had taken that the right way then the most contentious decision of the game would not have mattered so much.’

Bolton made the better start and almost took the lead in the opening minutes when Tim Ream’s glancing header from a corner forced Millwall keeper David Forde into making a save.

Eidur Gudjohnsen - who was making his first start for Bolton after coming out of retirement - showed glimpses of magic with his exquisite first touch and ability to pick out a pass. But was unable to find the killer ball to help the visitors take the lead.

Millwall’s first chance of the game came midway through the first half when Magaye Gueye picked out Lee Gregory with a pin-point pass but the striker fired his shot across goal and just beyond the far post.

Forde was forced into another save when Lee Chung-Yong played in Darren Pratley - but the midfielder was unable to find a way past the Millwall keeper.

And it was Millwall who ended the half on top as Angel fired just wide from a Andy Wilkinson cross.

Millwall were looking for their second win in a row following last week’s victory at Bolton and no one seemed to want it more than stand-in skipper Danny Shittu who ran the length of the pitch only to lose the ball and end up in the book for a foul on Lee - but it was enough to bring the home fans to life.

Former Den midfielder Liam Trotter replaced Goodjohnsen on the hour mark and was greeted to a chorus of boos. But he nearly had the last laugh as his first shot from distance forced Forde into making a save

The best chance of the game fell to Rob Hall whose shot hit the inside of the post before hitting Forde and somehow not crossing the line.

But the visitors did take the lead minutes later when Darren Pratley was played through and fired his shot in off the underside off the crossbar to give Bolton a lead they just about deserved.

And in the dying minutes they needed Lonergan to make sure of the win as he denied Martyn Woolford when the Millwall man was through on goal.

Bolton boss Neil Lennon said: ‘That’s the best we have played away from home for a while and we were worthy of the win.

‘The penalty could easily have been given. Andy maintains that Gregory ran into him and thankfully the decision went our way.

‘We felt we could have had one in the first half after a barge on Rob Hall.

‘But of course I feel sympathy when a decision goes against you. We have had them in the past when they don’t go your way so I can understand Ian’s frustration.

‘I didn't think the referee had the best of games for either side, but I’m grateful the decision went our way.’

The win lifts the Trotters up to 14th in the Championship and Lennon can reflect on a good start to his Bolton tenure having taken over with the side languishing in the bottom three when he took charge in September.
