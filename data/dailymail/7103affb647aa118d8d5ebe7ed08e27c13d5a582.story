In a stunning admission Tuesday afternoon, a senior White House official told reporters on a conference call that part of the continuing U.S. mission in Afghanistan will involve training security forces in that country to 'help us' defeat al-Qaeda – not the other way around.

The White House has sought to assure the press that the U.S. role after 2014 would be reduced to what President Barack Obama called 'an advisory role' just an hour later.

But the official's statement, which drew no follow-up inquiry from the few reporters permitted to ask questions, indicates that American forces will take on a more substantial part of Afghanistan's coming security needs.

Obama said at the White House that 'one year ago Afghan security forces assumed the lead in combat operations,' and that 2014 will be 'the year we will conclude our combat mission in Afghanistan.'

But his senior surrogate told a different story.

'We want to maintain a counterterrorism ability' there to keep al-Qaeda in check, he said. 'We're going to train Afghan National Security Forces to help us in mitigating that threat.'

Who's helping whom? President Barack Obama said the US was training Afghan fighters to be independent and autonomous, but a senior White House official said an hour earlier that the Afghans were being trained 'to help us' fight terrorists

'We have struck significant blows against al-Qaeda's leadership,' Obama said, claiming credit for killing Osama bin Laden

Both the president and the senior official emphasized the United States' incremental victories over Islamist terror groups, although neither mentioned Islam.

'We have struck significant blows against al-Qaeda's leadership,' Obama said. 'We have eliminated Osama bin Laden. We have prevented Afghanistan from being used to launch attacks against our homeland.'

'We've helped train and equip [Afghan] security forces,' he added. 'Now we're finishing the job we started.'

Still, Obama plans to 
leave 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan at the end of the year, 
officially to continue training Afghan fighters for their longer-term 
battles with al-Qaeda and to stymie insurgent attacks.

And the senior official said that by the end of 2016, one month before Obama leaves office, America's presence in Afghanistan will be reduced to an 'embassy presence with a security assistance office.'

That opens up the possibility that Bagram Air Base, the sprawling 8-square-mile center of U.S. combat operations there, could be shuttered or turned over to Afghanistan.

It could also be maintained with a skeleton crew in case the U.S. needed to return in force, according to a Pentagon analyst who spoke with MailOnline on background.

However they are deployed, servicemen and women are likely to remain in harm's way.

There are currently about 32,800 Americans serving in Afghanistan, down from a high of about 100,000 in the middle of 2010.

Obama promised during his February 2013 State of the Union address to Congress that the U.S. effort there would draw to a close by the end of 2014.

Vague message: 'This year we will bring the war in Afghanistan to a responsible end,' Obama said -- but he's leaving 9,800 servicemen and women behind

President Barack Obama made his sixth visit to Afghanistan over the weekend, but just his first since winning re-election in 2012

He
 said Sunday that he has 'made it clear that we’re prepared to continue 
cooperating with our Afghan partners on two security missions: training 
and equipping Afghan forces and targeting – counterterrorism targets – 
against al Qaeda.'

House Armed Services Chairman Buck McKeon, a California Republican, blasted the president's move on Tuesday.

'Holding this mission to an arbitrary egg-timer doesn’t make a lick of sense strategically,' McKeon said in a statement.

Telegraphing military deployment and withdrawal timetables to America's enemies has become a bone of contention for Obama, even among otherwise friendly national security experts.

'Good for Obama for keeping 9,800 troops in Afghanistan as requested by Gen. Dunford,' tweeted Council on Foreign Relations scholar Max Boot. 'Too bad he is imposing a counterproductive timeline.'

And Justin Logan, the director of foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, tweeted a mocking note: 'If you like your 2014 Afghanistan withdrawal date, you can keep it.'

'Holding this mission to an arbitrary egg-timer doesn¿t make a lick of sense strategically': Rep. Buck McKeon, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, slammed Obama's move

A prickly Obama scolded a reporter 
from the Real Clear Politics website on Tuesday during an educational 
event at the White House after she asked him a question about 
Afghanistan.

'I’m sorry, we’re doing a science fair – c’mon. C’mon,' Obama said before walking out of the room.

Other congressional Republicans issued their thoughts on Obama's announcements late Tuesday afternoon.

Senate Armed Services Committee ranking Republican Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma said in a statement that in hearings and meetings with military leaders 'it has been determined that we need 13,000 troops on the ground to best accomplish the mission with Afghans [sic] security forces.'

'Anything less, and we are putting more lives at risk,' he said.

And House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said he doubt the policy 'reflected by these numbers and timelines' that the president outlined.

'Even now, an al-Qaeda safe haven is emerging in northeastern Afghanistan; and I question whether the enemy will take further advantage of the announced timeline to renew its efforts to launch new operations, as we see them attempting in Iraq and Syria today.'

U.S. military personnel will only remain in the country if its president 
signs a Bilateral Security Agreement – something Hamid Karzai has 
resisted but his likely successors say they will embrace. That document 
is intended to formalize U.S. efforts to train Afghans and launch counterterrorism operations.

'Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women,' Obama said in this State of the Union speech 15 months ago. 'This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead.'

'Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.'

Loophole: Obama has insisted he will not keep any Americans in Afghanistan without a signed security agreement that would grant those forces immunity from Afghan law

'For many of you, this will be your last tour in Afghanistan,' Obama said to applause -- but nearly 10,000 will end up staying

But the 
president still alluded to that security agreement that Karzai refused 
to sign, saying the U.S. aimed to remain in-country to actively hunt 
down al-Qaeda and help Afghans do the same.

'Beyond
 2014, America’s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will 
endure,' Obama said, 'but the nature of our commitment will change.'

'We're
 negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two
 missions – training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country 
does not again slip into chaos, and counterterrorism efforts that allow 
us to pursue the remnants of al-Qaeda and their affiliates. 

Instead of a total withdrawal,
 the senior White House official confirmed, U.S. troop numbers would drop 
by half by the end of next year and dwindle near zero by the time Obama 
leaves office.

Obama doubled down on his promise four months ago in his 2014 State of the Union address, this time promising that only a 'small force' would remain behind after 2014.

'More than 
60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan,' he told 
Congress on January 28. 'With Afghan forces now in the lead for their 
own security, our troops have moved to a support role.'

'Together
 with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this 
year, and America’s longest war will finally be over.'

'If
 the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have 
negotiated,' he added, 'a small force of Americans could remain in 
Afghanistan with NATO allies.'

The 9,800 American troops who remain after December will be mainly stationed in Kabul and at Bagram Air Base.

Obama visited Bagram on Sunday, surprising servicemen and women with a pledge 
to bring America’s longest war to a 'responsible end' by the 
close of the year.

He said then that the 
war had reached a pivotal point since with Afghan forces were prepared to take primary 
responsibility for their country’s security.

Whither Bagram? Obama spoke Sunday at Bagram Air Base, but its future is uncertain as the White House plans to have nothing more by the end of Obama's presidency than an embassy with a security office nearby

Obama was greeted by US Ambassador to Afghanistan James Cunningham (C) and Marine General Joseph Dunford, commander of the US-led International Security Assistance Force (L) -- the men who will preside over a continued US presence there

'For many of 
you, this will be your last tour in Afghanistan,' Obama told hundreds
 of U.S. troops inside an airplane hangar on Sunday 'America’s war in Afghanistan will come to a responsible end.'

But 'America's commitment to 
the people of Afghanistan will endure,' he added. 'After all the 
sacrifices we've made, we want to preserve the gains you have helped to 
win.'

The president was expected to make an 
announcement about Afghanistan on Wednesday during a speech at the U.S. 
Military Academy at West Point.

Instead, the White House elected to make a Rose Garden announcement Tuesday afternoon.

Elections are underway to replace Karzai, the only president 
Afghanistan has known since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.

He and Obama have spoken just once in the past year.

At least 2,181 U.S. military personnel have died during the nearly 13-year Afghan war.

Obama has staked much of his foreign policy philosophy on ending the two wars he inherited from his predecessor, George W. Bush.

The final American troops withdrew 
from Iraq in the closing days of 2011 after the U.S. and Iraq failed to 
reach a security agreement to keep a small American residual force in 
the country. In the years that have followed the American withdrawal, 
Iraq has been battered by resurgent waves of violence.

U.S.
 officials say they're trying to avoid a similar scenario.

Afghanistan 'will not be a perfect place. And it is not America's responsibility to make it one,' Obama said Tuesday in the White House Rose Garden.

'Americans have learned that it's harder to end wars than it is to begin them – but this is how wars end in the 21st century.'
