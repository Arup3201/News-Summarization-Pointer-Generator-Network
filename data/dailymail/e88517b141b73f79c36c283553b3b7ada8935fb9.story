Fans of James Cameron's Oscar-winning film Avatar will soon be able to soar high above Pandora and interact with the planet's glow-in-the-dark plants.

Disney has announced plans to open an interactive theme park in 2017 based on the science fiction movie at its Animal Kingdom attraction in Florida.

Modeled on the home of the blue-skinned Na'vi where the blockbuster film was set, Avatar Land will feature floating mountains and jungles of bioluminescence plants that are being recreated by Disney and Cameron.

'From the moment we released Avatar, 
there was this amazing visceral response from people around the world 
that they wanted to go to Pandora,' Cameron said. 'Now thanks to Disney that's going to be possible.'

The first glimpse of what is being called Avatar Land was revealed at Japan's D23 Expo over the weekend.

Artists' impressions and a scaled-down version of the proposed theme park show a forested water park that will lead tourists around striking visual effects. 

'In my wildest imagination growing up, I don't think I could have ever envisioned the daywhere something I created would live inside a Disney theme park,' Cameron said.

His special effects teams have been working with Disney to come up with the new technology needed to make the park a reality.

The attraction will have rides and nighttime shows based on the film, according to Time. But the biggest draw will be the interactive experience it offers.

'Above and beyond the key attractions, the land of Pandora itself is filled with experiences the land comes to life when you interact with it and seems to be a living creature itself,' Disney imagineering executive Joe Rohde said.

'The sheer beauty of the forest at night, all the beauty, all the wonder, the scale and grandeur you remember from that film' is what we can expect, Mr Rohde said.

With its ground-breaking CGI and 3D visual effects, Avatar became the highest-grossing film of all time, earning $2.7 billion worldwide.

It was such a hit that Cameron is currently working on three sequels, due to be released in 2016, 2017 and 2018, according to Yahoo.

'In the world of Avatar, guests will encounter awe-inspiring floating mountains and wander through a night-time jungle of bioluminescent plants that are alive with light and sound,' Walt Disney parks chairman Tom Staggs said.

'Guests will also discover what it feels like to soar into the sky riding a banshee,' he added.
