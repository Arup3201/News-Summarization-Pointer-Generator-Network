Manchester City held on to win the bragging rights in their local derby as Sergio Aguero's 10th league goal of the season proved to be the difference at the Etihad Stadium.

Chris Smalling was sent off for Manchester United in the first-half but Louis van Gaal's side applied themselves during a fiercely competitive game.

Here, Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell gives his verdict on how the players performed at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday afternoon.

MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-2) 

Joe Hart - 7

Fortunate to avoid reprimand when he touched heads with referee Michael Oliver in arguing an appeal. Saved well with his foot from Van Persie and superbly from Di Maria to ensure win.

Pablo Zabaleta - 6

Should have been carded for lunge on Van Persie and blazed over chance in second half. Did receive a yellow for diving in on Rooney in the second period. 

Vincent Kompany - 6.5

Vocal as ever in organising the City defence and couple of tackles to catch the eye but lost Fellaini twice at set piece to allow the Belgian headers in the closing stages. 

Martin Demichelis - 7

Excellent distribution, with one ball to Milner particularly good, and rarely appeared ruffled. The only exception being his mistimed slide on Di Maria to earn him a yellow. 

Gael Clichy - 6.5

In the main coped admirably against Di Maria and offered plenty going forwards, providing the killer cross for Aguero’s deciding goal. 

Jesus Navas - 7.5

An electric presence on the right wing for City and repeatedly troubled Shaw with darts round the outside. Hit the post with a good chance in the second half.

Yaya Toure - 7.5

Delivered the pass that unlocked United’s makeshift defence, slipping a ball of perfect weight and direction to Clichy. Still not his barnstorming best but getting there. 

Fernando - 6.5

Brought in to add stability but also showed his class with a cross for Aguero early on. But got a little swamped by United’s resurgence in the second period and got a booking. 

James Milner - 7.5

Offered strong protection defensively down the left but also a creative spark. Drew foul from Smalling that saw him sent off.

Sergio Aguero - 8

A buzzing presence as usual from the first whistle and finished his goal superbly, gaining space with smart movement. Not happy when hooked by Pellegrini late on. 

Stevan Jovetic - 6.5

Offered a good foil for his strike partner on his first start since August. Tired towards the end and was replaced.

SUBSTITUTES:

Samir Nasri (On for Milner 70') - 5

Added verve but little defensive assistance.

Edin Dzeko (On for Jovetic 71') - 5

Should have done better with a chance.

Fernandinho (On for Aguero 83')- 5

Manchester United keeper David de Gea made a number of key saves against their local rivals on Sunday

MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-4-1) 

David de Gea - 7.5

Once again United’s best player. Razor reflexes to keep out Navas’s early shot that was heading high into the net and brave to leap at the feet of Aguero as he bore down on goal. 

Antonio Valencia - 4.5

Performed like a right-winger operating at right-back. Uncertain of his positioning so consistenly left holes for City to exploit. No surprise City’s opener came from that flank. 

Chris Smalling - 2     Dereliction of duty to get sent off in the manner he did in a game of this importance. His two yellow cards were dumb and dumber. Utter stupidity from the grammar school graduate.

Marcos Rojo - 4

Extremely lucky to escape the red card that would have followed if referee Oliver had spotted his foul as last man on Toure. Looked suspect until he did eventually depart early with a nasty shoulder injury.  

Luke Shaw - 6.5

Racing Navas down the wing will get even the fittest player puffing his cheeks but coped well by and large. Growing into the left-back United paid all that money for. 

Marouane Fellaini - 7

Begun the match with a Zidane turn, should have conceded a penalty with a clip on Aguero, added grit to attacks, but missed a glorious chance for an equaliser with his header.

Daley Blind - 5.5

Guilty of giving away possession too often and lack of pace was exploited by City’s speed on the break. Booked for a foul on Toure.  

Wayne Rooney - 7.5

Performance for the team, playing first in midfield then out wide and a constant source of motivation. Set up Di Maria chance with superb run from deep.

Adnan Januzaj - 6

Sparkled on occasion in the early stages but failed to impose himself greatly and understandably the man sacrificed when United went down to 10 men. 

Angel di Maria - 7

Drew lunging fouls from Demichelis and Fernando that earned both bookings and his energy was major factor in United ending the match in the ascendancy.

Robin van Persie - 6

Did excellently to craft his only chance by dribbling past Clichy to shoot from a tight angle but does not possess enough mobility to function as focal point for counter-attacks. 

SUBSTITUTES:

Michael Carrick (On for Januzaj 43’) - 6.5

Coped well as emergency centre-back playing for the first time in six months.

Paddy McNair (On for Rojo 55') - 5 Allowed Aguero to escape for the winner. 

James Wilson (On for Van Persie 82') - 5
