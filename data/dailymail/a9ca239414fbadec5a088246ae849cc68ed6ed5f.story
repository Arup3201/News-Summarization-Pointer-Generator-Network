A California teenager used a little help from a horse named Romeo when he rode into his high school to ask a girl to the prom. 

But Miguel Gonzales got a little more than he bargained for when he won the girl - and a two-day suspension.

Gonzales, 17, borrowed the horse from a friend's ranch and galloped right on up to Catalina Hernandez's first period class, holding a sign that said 'Will you ride with me to prom?'

Miguel Gonzales, 17, got a little help from a horse named Romeo to ask Catalina Hernandez to the prom 

The Milpitas High School senior got the idea from the school's Spirit Day theme, which was 'salad dressing day'. 

He dressed up as a cowboy, boots and all, to represent ranch dressing. Hernandez was dressed in a toga to symbolize Caesar salad.  

Hernandez and her peers ran out of their classrooms, phones in hand, and she quickly said yes. 

But the students' principal was hardly excited by the grand gesture.

'I was there for a bit and I knew people would come like security so I tried to leave,' Gonzales told the San Jose Mercury News. 

The Milpitas High School senior was suspended for his grand gesture, as the school deemed the horse was a 'potential threat' to other students walking in the same path. But Gonzales will still be able to attend the prom

'But on my way I heard the principal screaming... I kind of knew I was going to get into trouble.' 

Gonzales said he expected to get detention or Saturday school, but had no idea he could face suspension. 

District Superintendent Cheryl Jordan said Gonzales was suspended because the horse was a 'potential threat' to other students who where 'walking in the same path.' 

The teenager said his only regret was not talking to the principal beforehand about his grand plan and 'trying to figure out a way to do it where I wouldn't get into trouble'.

Despite the suspension, Gonzales will still be allowed to go to the prom with his date by his side.
