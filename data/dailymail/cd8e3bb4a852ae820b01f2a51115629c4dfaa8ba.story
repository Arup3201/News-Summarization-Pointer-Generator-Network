Italy have sold just 200 tickets for their opening World Cup clash with England and have returned the rest of their allocation.

Italian supporters traditionally wait until the latter stages of the competition before travelling, meaning they will be heavily outnumbered for the game in Manaus on June 14.

In contrast, England have sold their 2,500 allocation to members of the official supporters club as well as the 3,800 tickets they were given for the match with Uruguay, reports the Daily Telegraph.

No support: Italy have sold only 200 tickets for the opening game of their World Cup campaign against England

Italy take on Luxembourg on Wednesday in their final warm-up match before travelling to Brazil and manager Cesare Prandelli will ring the changes against the minnows.

AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli will spearhead the attack and Prandelli also explained the reasons behind the omission of Giuseppe Rossi.

The striker had lashed out at his manager on Twitter after being left out.

But Prandelli said: 'I said several times -- Beppe, you're not in the 23 (man squad). Before the Ireland game I said that in physical terms he was fine but that I expected to see something extra from him. I wanted to see a striker's performance, but I didn't see what I wanted to see.'
