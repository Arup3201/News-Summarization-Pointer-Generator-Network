The lost city of Atlantis may only be a legend, but if these designs are anything to go by then underwater towns could soon become a reality.

This incredible 'Floating City', which spans four square miles, comes with its own dock, roadways and farms to make it completely self-sufficient.

It would also feature vertical gardens, a hotel, entertainment complex and a huge floating arena which could host gigs and sports matches.Â 

The Floating City has been designed by British and Asian architects and will feature its own docks, roadways and even farms meaning it will be self-sufficient

The city will be connected above water with a series of canals meaning eco-friendly boats and submarines could provide most of the transportation

The metropolis will be made from a series of hexagonal and triangular modules which connect using walkways and tunnels both above and below the waves

The building is made from hexagonal and 
triangular modules which connect together above and below the water 
using a series of walkways and tunnels.

The water world was dreamed up by British and Asian-based design firm AT Design Office and commissioned by Chinese construction firm CCCC.

A series of canals connect the settlement together, meaning eco-friendly boats and submarines can provide most of the transportation.

And for when you need to get somewhere quickly, the designers intend to fill the city with electric cars, which will prevent the underwater sections from becoming polluted.

While there will be trees throughout the underwater metropolis, there will also be two designated areas of greenery for residents to enjoy.

For those just wanting to visit there will be a large cruise dock to allow tourism and travel to and from the island.

While trees will be dotted around the oasis, there will also be two dedicated green spaces within the city for residents to enjoy, along with panoramic views of the ocean

If construction gets the go-ahead then architects will use the same technology currently being used to build a 31-mile bridge between Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai

If the project were to become a reality, CCCC will use some of the same technologies they are currently using to build a 31-mile bridge between Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai.

Siska Slavomir, architect at AT Design Office, said: 'Part of that bridge is an underwater tunnel which is joined by a 150-metre-long precast concrete box.

'The mega box is cast on a nearby island and floated to site before being connected.

'We were appointed to work with the engineer to come up with a master plan for a 10-square-kilometre floating island that can be built with the same technology.

'The project offered an opportunity to develop a new urban nucleus of world-class residential, commercial and cultural facilities, as well as to promote a zero-carbon, energy-efficient and self-sufficient city.'

According to Dezeen, the proposal is now being reviewed by one of China's largest property investors, China Transport Investment Co, for a smaller scale project that could be built off of Hong Kong.

In order to stop the underground tunnels becoming polluted, and to keep the city eco-friendly, citizens will use electric cars to get wherever they need to go

The designers hope the city will become a tourist destination, equipped with a dock large enough for cruise ships, and to allow transport to and from the colony
