She has cheered him on through every game - for better or for worse.

But it seems Kim Sears may be waiting a little longer to hear those words at the altar, despite her obvious devotion.

Andy Murray yesterday batted off questions over whether he was ready to settle down as he celebrated his historic victory.

There has long been speculation as to 
when he might propose to his girlfriend of seven years, and this has 
intensified now that he has finally achieved his dream of winning 
Wimbledon.

But asked about 
whether he was ready to marry Miss Sears, Murray looked perturbed. After
a long pause, he said: ‘No… I haven’t thought about that yet.’

Yesterday
patient Kim was in the Players’ Box cheering on her boyfriend as usual –
with the  tension of the game clear to see on her face.

On
seeing Murray win, she put her hands on her head in apparent disbelief 
and mouthed: ‘Oh my God.’ Minutes earlier, she had said ‘I can’t believe
this’ as Murray won yet another vital point.

Miss Sears, 25, wore a £925  mint green lace dress designed by Victoria Beckham.

It
is thought the dress was given to Kim to wear as the Beckhams and 
Murray are both managed by Simon Fuller’s XIX Entertainment, offering 
Mrs Beckham unrivalled free advertising in front of millions of 
television viewers.

Last year Miss Sears was loaned  a pair of £300 Victoria Beckham sunglasses to wear for the Wimbledon finals, when Murray lost to Roger Federer.

Miss Sears was still a teenager in the sixth form when she met Murray through her father Nigel, the head of UK women’s tennis coaching.

The pair were introduced at a tournament in America and Murray wooed her with flowers and texts.

The couple moved in together  in 2009 before splitting briefly. Six months later, they reunited after discovering they were miserable apart.

Those close to Murray have said Miss Sears would be the perfect tennis wife because she brings ‘calmness’ to him while he  is on court.

Murray has hinted in the past that marriage is something Miss Sears would want, but has always said they were not at the right stage in their lives.

Last year he said: ‘I have no plans to get married right now. I am still fairly young. But we’ll see.’
