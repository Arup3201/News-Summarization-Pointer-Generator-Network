Hundreds of people ran into the sea naked as temperatures plummeted in an attempt to set a new world record for the biggest ever skinny dip.

A crowd of just over 200 people stripped off and ran into the sea at sunrise for The North East Skinny Dip in Druridge Bay, Northumberland, but failed to break the record.

The event was organised to raise money for mental health charity Mind and those involved are confident they have raised thousands.

Unfortunately the organisers said they think the numbers fell short of breaking the record.

People taking part said they also used it to celebrate their bodies as well as mark the autumn equinox.

Organiser Jacqueline Higginson, 34, from Whitburn, said: 'I did a skinny dip last year where we broke the world record. I donâ€™t think there was enough to do it [yesterday] but there was enough of us for it to be a lot of fun.

'We chose Mind because I feel very close to the issues around mental health both personally and as a paramedic as I see it all around me.

'And hopefully I think we have raised thousands of pounds for Mind.'

Last year, a skinny dip was held at 
Rhossili beach in Wales, where more than 400 people plunged naked into 
the sea and raised money for cancer and the National Trust.

Ms Higginson took part in that event and that gave her the inspiration to organise a similar event in the North East.

The National trust, which owns the section of beach they used, gave their permission for the cheeky event to take place.
