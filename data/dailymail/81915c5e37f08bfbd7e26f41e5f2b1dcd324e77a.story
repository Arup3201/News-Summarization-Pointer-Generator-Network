Mo Farah’s double gold medal triumphs at last year’s Olympic Games were watched by millions around the world – but obviously not by the TV journalist who asked: ‘Haven’t you run before?’

Mistaking Farah for a plucky amateur after he won the New Orleans half-marathon on Sunday, LaTonya Norton congratulated him, before saying: ‘This isn’t your first time?’

A clearly perplexed Farah, 29, who broke the British half-marathon record with his time of 1 hour and 59 seconds, replied: ‘Sorry?’

Cringeworthy: Mo Farah appeared stunned when a U.S. news anchor asked him, 'haven't you run before?'

Embarrassing: Unaware of her mistake, WDSU presenter LaTontya Norton repeated her gaffe

Viewers were left cringing when Norton spoke to the British champion runner on the local television network WDSU after the race on Sunday.

But Norton, who had earlier congratulated Farah on his victory, was unaware of her blunder, and put her foot in her mouth again by repeating the question and asking if it was his first time.

The celebrated athlete, who is one of the most famous faces to come out of the Olympic Games in London last summer, then smiled as he replied: 'No it's not my first time.

'I have done before half marathons, but not New Orleans. This is my first time in New Orleans.'

Norton went on to embarrass herself even further by asking Farah what it takes to 'prepare for a marathon like this'.

Record breaker: The Olympic champion had broken a record in the New Orleans half marathon

Poor research: Norton clearly did not know she was talking to the 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic gold medalist

He
replied: 'I haven't done a marathon yet. I'm hoping to do one in 2014. 
This year I'm just going to concentrate on the track and field.

'But a marathon is a long way, it's 
double the distance I have done today. I have still got to learn a lot 
and train more for it.'

But the athlete did not let the 
disastrous interview ruin his day. He said he 'really enjoyed' the race 
and the fact the crowd 'got really behind' the runners.

He said: 'It was a fast course so it was nice to break the course record.'

Has he run before? Mo Farah reacts as he wins the men's 5,000m final at the London 2012 Olympic Games

The
interview has caused a stir on Twitter, where British journalist Piers 
Morgan, who is currently working in the U.S. tweeted: 'Hey @Mo_Farah - 
come on my CNN show tonight to discuss that crazy U.S. interview... I 
know you've run before, just not as fast as me.'

Mo Farah arrived in London aged eight from Somalia, where he was born, and barely spoke a word of English. He was had grown up in the African country as it descended into devastating civil war but was bale to flee to the UK.

He went to Feltham Community College, London, where his talent was spotted and nurtured by PE teacher Alan Watkinson. His first major title came at the European Athletics Junior Championship in 2001 in the 5,000m.

Farah won the European Championship gold in the 5,000m and 10,000m in 2010 in Barcelona, and a week later became the first British man to run under 13 minutes in the 5,000m.

He soon became the first British man to win gold in the 5,000m at the World Championships in Daegu in 2011, when he smashed the European record.

Farah secured his place in history last summer in London last summer, becoming the first British man to win Olympic gold in the 10,000m, and one of only five people to also win gold in the 5,000m.

Britain's most successful distance runner of all time was awarded a CBE in the New Year's Honours list and has expressed his desire to move into marathon running.

Fellow
Olympian Zac Purchase, who won a rowing gold in 2008 in Beijing in the 
lightweight double sculls, wrote: 'Wow, this is painful.... Mo Farah 
asked by US TV presenter: 'Haven't you run before?'

British marathon runner Claire Hallissey added: 'Te he!' Mo Farah asked by US TV presenter: 'Haven't you run before?'

Runner's World magazine has dismissed the incident as 'possibly the worst interview ever', while five-time Paralympic gold medalist Noel Thatchter labelled it 'excruciating'.

The list of anchors on WDSU's Wikipedia page had been edited this afternoon to read: 'LaTonya 'Doesn't know who Mo Farah is' Norton'.

Farah, who won gold in the 5,000 
metres and 10,000 metres at the Olympics, had completed the Rock 'N' 
Roll Half Marathon in 61 minutes - a course record.

He
was being interviewed in City Park in New Orleans, while Norton asked 
her poorly-researched questions from the television studio.

Somali-born
Farah, 29, was featured by media across the country for winning the 
13.1-mile event, which attracted around 15,000 competitors, on Sunday.

He beat Ethiopian runner Gebre 
Gebremariam, a world junior champion, to the finish line, out sprinting 
his rival over a dramatic final 200 metres.

Farah,
who has become an iconic figure in British sport, arrived in London 
from Mogadishu, Somalia, at the age of eight and spoke very little 
English.

The runner continues to live in London 
with his wife Tania, step-daughter Rhianna and their twins Aisha and 
Amani, but also spends much of his time in Portland, Oregon.

His talent was spotted and nurtured by PE teacher Alan Watkinson at Feltham Community College, west London.

Farah's remarkable achievements include 
him becoming the first British man to run the 5,000m under 13 minutes, 
and the first to win gold in the 5,000m at the World Championship.

Doubtful: Champion marathon runner Paula Radcliffe has said it is strange that Farah is starting his long distance career with half-marathons

He went on to secure his place in 
history with his Olympic double - making him the only British man to win
the 10,000m at the Games and one of only five people to secure gold in 
both.

He has said he plans to compete in a half marathon in London in April before attempting the full 26.2-mile race next year.

But decorated British marathon runner Paula Radcliffe has said it is strange that Farah is starting his long distance career by running only half races.

She also questioned whether he will be too skinny to excel on the road, despite Farah's insistence that his approach will provide the 'perfect practice' for next year - as he will be familiar with the route and routine of the event.

Radcliffe, who set a course record when 
making her London Marathon debut in 2002, said she would not have 
employed the same tactics.

She has drawn comparisons with South 
African runner Elana Meyer, who exceed at half-marathons but could not 
repeat the success over the full distance.

Radcliffe said: 'I just don’t understand it. I do find it a little bit strange. Just go in and do a marathon. Race it hard.

'I
would say Mo is well capable of running a two-hour four-minute 
marathon, but you have to just see him do the first run and see.'

The 39-year-old added: 'Mo is very skinny but he’s got lots of strength there. But you don’t know.’
