A one-time glamor model has been arrested today in connection with a massive child porn bust. 

Julia Lack, 26, of Pearland, Texas, was arrested on Thursday and charged with one count of child pornography possession.

Her boyfriend Tad Jeremy Costin, 41, was arrested on November 1 in a case involving potentially thousands of images of a man taking part in sexual acts with children.

Costin has been charged with four counts of aggravated sexual assault 
of a child under age 14. He  allegedly assaulted at least 15 young girls aged under seven years old.

Lack is listed as an 'inactive model' on Playboy's Miss Social competition - an online non-nude gallery where contestants submit and post their own photos.

Playboy told MailOnline that Lack has no affiliation with or has ever been employed by Playboy.

She never has held any titles associated with Playboy, including Playmate or Miss Social.

She is being held at Pearland jail on $30,000 bail.

Costin was arrested last week after 
investigators found computer memory cards containing hundreds of images 
of child pornography in boxes at his former home in Dayton.

Costin moved to Pearland a few months ago and shares a home with his girlfriend and her five-year-old son. 

The sickening discovery of child porn was made by Lack's father Benny who found the images in a box left behind by his daughter at his home when she moved out.

Investigators then allegedly found six hard drives and 80 CDs containing further abuse pictures at Costin's new address in Pearland.

Detectives say pictures included ones of him assaulting young children. Police believe there are 15 victims who have not been identified and say they are not related to Costin.

They said some of the pictures could date back as far as 1990.

Harris
 County Assistant District Attorney Kathryn Kahle told KHOU that the 
children appeared unresponsive in the pictures and may have been 
drugged.

She said: 'They are dressed in what appear to be nightgowns, little girl nightgowns.

'Some of them look as if they are unresponsive and/or drugged when they are engaged in those sexual acts.'

Deputies said Costin has previously been arrested for similar offenses. He is currently being held in the Harris County jail without bond.
