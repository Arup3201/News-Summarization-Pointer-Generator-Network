Charged: Dale Cregan has pleaded not guilty to the murders of PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone

Dale Cregan has denied murdering two female police officers who died in a gun and grenade attack.

Cregan, 29, pleaded not guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to the murders of Greater Manchester Police constables Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone.

The officers were killed as they responded to a report of a burglary in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, on September 18.

Relatives of the two police officers attended the hearing flanked by police family liaison officers.

Funerals were held at Manchester Cathedral for the 
two policewomen on two consecutive days last month with hundreds lining the streets to pay their respects.

PC Boneâ€™s colleague PC Tracey Miskell paid tribute to the 'perfect police officer'.

He said: 'Fiona was wonderful. She 
was wonderful at keeping colleagues' spirits high with her bubbly 
nature. She was wonderful about caring for others.

'Fiona represented the best that humanity has to offer the world but that makes her loss even greater.'

Speaking at the funeral of Pc Hughes, Police chaplain Keith Stewart said: 'She
was greatly respected and loved by her colleagues who would variously 
describe her as friendly, full of life, always willing to lend a hand, 
as keen as mustard, as brave as they come'

GMP chief constable Sir Peter Fahy paid tribute to both officers, saying: 'Nicola and Fiona (Bone) knew that the police service has the same expectations of female officers as male officers.'
