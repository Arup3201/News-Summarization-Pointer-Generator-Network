Regrets: Dame Stella Rimington told an audience at Henley Literary Festival of things she missed

She was once the real life ‘M’ who put her family on the line to be Director General of MI5.

But yesterday Dame Stella Rimington told how sometimes she regrets juggling her hectic career with her young family.

The 78-year-old claimed she struggled to be in two places at the same time and stated more should be done to help women in the work place.

Speaking after her lecture at the Henley Literary festival yesterday the mother-of-two told how she often regretted missing out on ‘sports day’ and ‘school plays’ because of the real life drama in the office.

Dedicated to her job, Dame Stella - who was director general for MI5 between 1992 and 1996 - claimed she would later be wracked with guilt as she explained to her children why she hadn’t made an appearance.

She said: ‘I had so many moments where I would worry about being late for the sports day or late for the meeting because I was at sports day.

‘It was perpetual really, you take a day off because your child is in the school play and then some drama will happen at the office.

‘I still had to go home and explain to my child why I didn’t make it.

‘There were a number of things I missed - I wish I could go back too. ‘When they were growing up relied hugely on nannies and grannies.’

Now a thriller writer, Dame Stella was the first female and first public director general of MI5.

Yesterday Dame Stella said women today still struggle to juggle their homes and their work, claiming she is disappointed and unimpressed by the lack of progression for helping working mothers.

She added: ‘I look at women in the work place now and I feel incredibly sad that the environment hasn’t changed more.

‘It shouldn’t still be difficult for women to juggle their family and their work life in 2013. The same problems shouldn’t face women today.

‘I thought by the time my daughters were to be mothers that they wouldn’t be faced with the this problem.

‘The government has previously promised to sort out child care and but it has failed.

‘There has been various promises that every borough, every town was going to have child care and they haven’t followed that up and it’s a great same.

‘It is still just as difficult as it was back in our day to have satisfactory arrangements.

‘And for our generation it is very sad to see and disappointing after everything we worked to change.

‘I really thought the world would have adapted better by now.

‘I think having women in senior positions is very important. Having a female Home Secretary is important. It is important women are in these positions to understand what women need in their homes.’

Dame Stella was invited to the festival to promote her latest novel The Geneva Trap.

A grandmother to five grandchildren she separated but never divorced from her husband John in 1984.
