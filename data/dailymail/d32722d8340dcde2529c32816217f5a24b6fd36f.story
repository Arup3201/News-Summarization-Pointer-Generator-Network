Rag and Bone designers  David Neville and Marcus Wainwright have only ever had one goal, to dress the cool girls.

And as fashion's ultimate cool girl Karlie Kloss closed their spring/summer 2013  show last night, walking out right after Victoria's Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel, with Christy Turlington and actress Maggie Gyllenhaal watching on from the front row, they had easily scored.

Full of electric green, cobalt blue and hi-vis coral, the British-born designers produced a collection that every New York City girl will want to be seen in next summer - no small feat, either.

Backstage, a photo of a die-hard car racer in head-to-toe leather standing in the sand next to a Bedouin was pinned to an inspiration board, giving some idea to the collection's origins.

Conjuring a childhood vision of the Dakar car rally, the designers infused their brand's usual effortless and urban edge with all things off-road.

fastening shirts, ankle-zippered pants and oversize biker jackets 
walked next to cool-girl full mini skirts and soft cotton nightshirts.

It's not often that an entire show is actually shoppable from the front-row. But with not a print in sight, Rag and 
Bone's stand out and high impact pieces, like one knockout thrown-on green dress, were instantly covetable.

And the pedal-to-the-metal heels coral, and perforated leather clutches were accessories every editor was noting down on their already long mental 'wish' list.

But not only an influencer in clothes, 
Rag and Bone's take on downtown-cool beauty will see the streets teeming
with strong brows and white nails next spring.

Collaborating with Revlon for the show, make-up artist Gucci Westman took inspiration from the supermodel era, recreating the iconic Nineties look with a fresh twist.

Structured brow were the focus, offset with subtle cheeks, lips and eyes. And the manicure of next season? White.

After the show, Mr Wainwright said to Vogue: 'It’s pushing our idea of what a cool girl wants to wear, clothes to live in and be seen in.'

Day three at New York Fashion Week also lay claim to another knockout show. Helmut Lang, a brand synonymous with black, white and all shades in between, shook things up for their spring/summer 2013 collection.

Featuring colour, and a lot of it, husband and wife designer duo Nicole and Michael Colovos discarded what has become their signature palette for the past five years.

Surfer-bright slashes of orange and sea blue sat next to electric reds and colourful jacquard prints broke the label's usual boundaries, pushing it in an (exciting) new direction.

An slick aquatic vision was applied on color-blocked tank dresses, reversible leather jackets and their shift dresses, which at times had a slight wet look.

Medallions and florals were splashed across boxy jackets and shorts, inspired by illustrations of nineteenth-century German biologist Ernst Haeckel, the prints were brought to life by tattoo artist Thomas Hooper, who re-created the drawings for the designers.

And according to Style.com, the bright red jacquard print of a crustacean on black T-shirt dress was 
inspired by the designers' own photo research of underwater creatures.

While the Colovoses may have taken a sharp colour-themed turn, the essence of Helmut Lang still resounded in the silhouettes.

While their usual drapery is, for the most part, missing in action, the baggy, slouched-on shapes with a slight sporty appeal came across in boxy
silk T-shirts and low-slung pants.

But the stand-out pieces - the slim fitted jackets and boxy blazers - were peppered with canvas and leather paneling, adding the perfect touch of downtown luxury.
