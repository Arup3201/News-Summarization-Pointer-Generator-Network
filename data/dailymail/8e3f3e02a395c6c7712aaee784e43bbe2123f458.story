Queens Park Rangers striker Loic Remy has joined up with his team-mates following the collapse of his proposed move to Liverpool.

France international Remy looked set to complete a permanent move away from Loftus Road before he failed a medical at Liverpool.

Remy, who impressed while on loan at Newcastle last season by scoring 14 league goals, even travelled to America to finalise his move to Brendan Rodgers' side.

However the 27-year-old has now returned to QPR and is in contention to take part in his side's pre-season friendly match against Athlone Town on Tuesday evening.

Harry Redknapp said he was willing to accept Remy back into his squad and questioned Liverpool's decision to pull the plug on the £8.5million move.

The former Portsmouth boss will be hoping Remy can score the goals to help QPR consolidate their place in the Premier League this season.
