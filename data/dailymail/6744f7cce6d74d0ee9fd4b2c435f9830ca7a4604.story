A reporter for Fox 5 in Washington D.C. has come under fire for telling very different versions of a home invasion story that she has repeated while advocating gun ownership.

Emily Miller, the chief investigative reporter for WTTG-TV, has previously claimed she fell victim to a terrifying home invasion on New Year's Day in 2010 while dog-sitting for friends at their house.

In one interview for the National Rifle Association, she said she returned to the home to find it being robbed before trying to take a photo of the suspect - and being chased by a group of 15 men.

But a police report has now revealed a very different - and far less harrowing - tale than the one she has shared publicly.

Changing story: Emily Miller, the chief investigative reporter for Fox 5, has repeatedly told a story in which she was the victim of a home invasion, but now a police report has revealed discrepancies in the accounts

The Washington Post's Erik Wemple unearthed a supplemental police report in which she told police she left the home for 10 minutes to walk the dog and when she returned, she saw a man walking out from behind a fence.

She asked him why he was there and he told her he was delivering firewood, the police report noted, and left.

Miller, who had forgotten to lock the door behind her when she took out the dog, went into the house and 'felt that something was not right', according to the report, so left to take a photo of his car.

Outside, the suspect gave her a business card showing a tree service company before leaving, and Miller saw that he was driving a silver truck showing the name of a landscaping company.

But later that evening, her credit card company called her about fraudulent activity on her card and she checked her wallet and saw the card and $50 were missing, according to the report.

She had left the wallet out on a table inside the unlocked home while walking the dog. 

The police report shows that after she told police about the fraudulent activity on her card, they tracked down the purchases to a Wal-Mart and a tattoo shop.

Harrowing: In one retelling of the story, for a 2014 video for the National Rifle Association (pictured), Miller said she returned to find the home being robbed and the man took off with her wallet

Terrifying: A reenactment of the crime in the NRA video shows it happened at night, rather than at 3pm

But when police tried to contact her to take the case further, she did not return messages they left on her phone on three separate occasions and the report was suspended.

The tale is far more dramatic when she re-tells it.

In one example, she recounted the story on a video for the NRA. A reenactment of the robbery in the video shows the robbery unfolding at night, rather than at 3pm as shown in the police report.

Tale: In her book, Miller says she attempted to take the man's photo in the street but he stopped her

'A man - the police believed to be a drug addict - got into the house and started robbing it,' she said on the video. 'So when I came back into the house he was in there robbing.

'He took my wallet but I was able to talk him out of the house without hurting me, thank God.'

She claims she then decided to follow him to get a picture - 'which was really stupid' - and came across 15 men standing around two pickup trucks in the street.

When they saw her, they started running towards her and she fled back to the house, where she called the police, she said. 

'Going to bed that night in this house, it was the first time in my life I thought "I just wish I had a gun by my night table then I can defend myself if those men come in",' she said. 

Miller has also said she was a 'victim of a home invasion' on other occasions, including in speeches.

And in a series for the Washington Times, 'Emily Gets Her Gun', she said the man told her he had come to service the swimming pool before leaving. She followed him with her phone.

'I walked down the street, and as I turned the corner, I saw about 15 scruffy young men standing around two pickup trucks,' she wrote.

When she held up her phone to take a photo, a man blocked her shot and demanded to know what she was doing.

'"Nothing, I'm um, just going now," I said as I put my Blackberry down instead of taking the picture around him and went home,' she wrote - not mentioning a chase.

She later turned her Washington Times series into a book, 'Emily Gets Her Gun... But Obama Wants to Take Yours', which was published in September 2013.

Advocate: She has shared the story while advocating for gun rights in Washington DC. In a recent series on Fox5, she charted her attempts to get a gun in the state

According to Wemple of the Washington Post, the discrepancies in her story are important because she 'has hitched her career' on it.

She has cited the incident as a driving force behind her wish to get a gun in Washington D.C., and has charted her attempt in a series on Fox5.

In a report on Fox5 last week, she revealed that she had been approved for the gun permit after providing the state two police reports showing threats on her life, she said.

In another questionable move, she has been described as a pro-gun advocate while still working as a journalist. Fox identified her as 'a proponent of Second Amendment rights' when it published her recent stories.

When reached by DailyMail.com for comment, Miller, 44, directed requests to Fox's public relations team, who have yet to respond.

Before working for Fox 5, she worked for The Washington Times, AOL's Politics Daily and ABC News, according to her online bio.
