TV presenter and home improvement queen Kirstie Allsopp just can't keep her sticky paws off that craft glue.

The house-hunter-turned-upcycling fanatic has been raiding reclamation yards, yanking apart chests of drawers and chopping up wallpaper, all in the name of teaching the DIY-loving masses how to transform old tat into new furniture on the cheap.

Viewers of B&Q's new You Can Do It channel can observe the enthusiastic Location, Location, Location star painting chairs pink, decoupaging tables with bits of newspaper and turning ratty old drawers into shelves in a series of online tutorials.

Kirstie Allsopp is a self-proclaimed upcycling fanatic, seldom to be found without paintbrush in hand

But does the wife of property developer Ben Anderson really fill their London home in affluent Notting Hill with such homespun 
delights? (Or does she plump for the pricier offerings sold by her 
potty-about-polka-dot designer cousin, Cath Kidston?)

One tutorial shows Allsopp - who comes from a family who have 'always painted furniture' - using vintage comic books to decoupage a bedside table for her stepson (Anderson has two sons from a previous relationship, and he and Kirstie have two sons together).

Kirstie's home-made shelves are created by taking apart chests, wallpapering the base, then drilling the shelves to the wall using rawl plugs

In another, the presenter removes the
drawers from a dusty old chest, lines them with patterned wallpaper and
then drills them to a wall to create a higgeldy-piggeldy patchwork of 
non-matching shelves.

'Upcycling
is the buzz word of the moment,' she says. 'What it means is revamping,
repainting, repolishing your furniture, putting your own personal stamp
on it without impacting the environment or your budget.'

'Kirstie's just such a brilliant ambassador,' says Simon Amster, creative director at B&Q's advertising agency's creative director.

'She really understands what can make a home absolutely fantastic. And the point about Kirstie is that she's all about inspiration. So craft-orientated, so financially-astute, and that combination makes her the perfect ambassador for the brand.

'The reason why we want to make a film like this is basically to inspire people. It's about taking a project, something that's been sitting around for a while, and asking how you can make it better without spending a lot of money.'
