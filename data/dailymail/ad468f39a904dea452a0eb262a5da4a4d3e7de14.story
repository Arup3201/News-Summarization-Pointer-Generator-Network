Monaco manager Leonardo Jardim has stressed that Real Madrid target Radamel Falcao is not for sale.

The 28-year-old forward is seen by the Champions League holders as the missing piece of their front line that already boasts the attacking talents of Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale.

Falcao scored the solitary goal for Monaco in their 1-0 pre-season win against Arsenal in the Emirates Cup on Sunday - his first start since rupturing knee ligaments in January.

The Colombian international missed his country's run to the World Cup quarter-finals this summer as a result, which saw his fellow countryman Rodriguez shine in Brazil with six goals.

Rodriguez's performances saw him earn a £63million transfer to Real in July from Monaco and Jardim doesn't wish to lose another integral player to the Bernabeu outfit.

'At this moment in time, Falcao is our player, and he is with us 100%. We don't want to let him leave,' Jardim told Ligue 1.com.

'It's a shame that we have lost James Rodriguez, but we can count on Falcao. It matters little what people say, he's our player.

'He's in the last stage of his recovery, and he'll be with us this season.'

Falcao moved to the Ligue 1 runners-up last summer in a £52million move from Real's bitter rivals Atletico - scoring nine goals in 17 league appearances before his season-ending injury.
