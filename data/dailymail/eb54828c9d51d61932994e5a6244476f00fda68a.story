Sanni was left to survive by herself but when she was discovered her face was covered in blood and her nose and lip had been eaten by mice.

Without money, her parents didn't take her to the hospital, but simply washed her wounds.

Director Wu Yuhua from the medical affairs office of the hospital said they will build Sani an artificial nose and lip, but the surgeries may take up to two years.
