Louis van Gaal will not bring Premier League glory to Manchester United in his first season in charge, according to Queens Park Rangers boss Harry Redknapp.

Redknapp, who completed the signing of former United defender Rio Ferdinand on Thursday, cannot see the Dutchman winning the title in his debut season without 'four fantastic players' arriving at old Trafford in addition to the signings of Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera.

'Van Gaal's got a good track record but they need players,' Redknapp told talkSPORT.

'He needs to bring four or five players in at least to get them back to where they were under Alex [Ferguson], where they were winning championships because they look well short of that at the moment.

'Certainly at this stage you wouldn’t want to bet on them winning the league next year. I wouldn’t see them winning it next year unless he suddenly pull three or four fantastic players out of the hat.'

Redknapp pointed to the strength of title rivals, Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal as evidence that United will struggle to immediately reach the top again after David Moyes' disastrous reign.

'I wouldn’t see them being as strong as Chelsea or Man City,' he added. 'I think Arsenal have made a great signing [in Alexis Sanchez] so they could get a lot closer next year.

'It’s quite open. I would love to see Liverpool have another great season but they’ve lost an incredible player [Luis Suarez], he’s irreplaceable really.'
