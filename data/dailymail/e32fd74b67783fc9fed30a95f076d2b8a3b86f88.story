A jobless father is demanding a bigger home after he and his wife had seven children in a council house with just two bedrooms.

David Stewart, 38, and his wife Lisa, 29, whose youngsters are all under seven, claim the cramped conditions are unhealthy for their young family.

Solomon, six, Clementine, five, Donald, four, Katy-Anne, three, twins Joshua and Sophie, two, and three-month-old baby April are 'crammed in like sardines' and making them depressed, Mr Stewart says.

Their home has three bedrooms, but one is filled with furniture bought by the family in case they move somewhere larger.

Big family: David and Lisa Stewart and their seven children aged from three months to six years share just two bedrooms in their home in Alness in the Scottish Highlands

At home: Mrs Stewart and her children, who says they have tried to get a larger home from the council but say they have been put to the back of the queue

The Stewarts' children sleep four to a room, or share with their parents.

Mr Stewart has accused his local council in the Highlands of losing his application form for a new house exchange twice and prioritising new families in the area.

Mr Stewart said his family's sleeping arrangements are causing stress and has called for more space for his children 

Mr Stewart said he and his wife fear for the health of their children living in such crowded conditions.

'I
 put in for an exchange five years ago but I knew these things took time
 and was prepared to be patient.

'Later I put
 in a second application, widening the geographic area, because I felt 
it might increase our chances if we were willing to be housed in other 
places.

'Then I heard of a four-bedroom house becoming available 
locally and I went to the council to ask if I could be considered for 
it. I was shocked to be told they didn’t even have an application from 
me.

'They said it must have gone astray in the post, but I didn’t 
understand how that could happen twice.

Crowded: Four of the Stewart children share a bedroom, and the other three sleep with in their parent's bedroom

Closed door: Mr Stewart accused Highland Council of ignoring their housing requests and prioritising families who have just moved to their area

'It’s now five years since I 
put the first application in and in that time I have seen many other 
families moving into Milnafua, some from abroad, and getting houses very
 quickly.

'Because we are so cramped - one of the bedrooms is used 
for storage - there are nine of us sleeping in two bedrooms. We’re like 
sardines.

'There are four kids in one room and three share a 
bedroom with myself and my wife.

“I suffer from chronic back 
problems for which I take several medications and I can’t always manage 
the stairs. As there isn’t a downstairs bedroom, I often have to sleep 
on the sofa.

“It’s making me and my wife extremely depressed and the 
health visitor has told us it’s not healthy for the kids either. We’re 
very worried about them. It is so unfair.”

A Highland Council spokeswoman said: 'While we are aware of the Stewart family’s concerns, we cannot discuss 
these with third parties but can confirm that we are liaising with the 
family.'
