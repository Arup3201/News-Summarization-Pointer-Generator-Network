As the number of people who have contracted hepatitis A from consuming frozen berries rises to nine across Australia, one woman has revealed her anger and fear over potentially being diagnosed with the virus.

Trudie Sims, from Ballarat in Victoria, had been using Nanna's frozen berries in smoothies until Sunday evening, when she was alerted to the health warning which had been issued.

'I'm really angry ... (and) it's absolutely terrified me', Ms Sims told Daily Mail Australia.

So far four cases of hepatitis A have been confirmed in Queensland, three in Victoria, and two in New South Wales. Ms Sims' case could take the national toll to ten.

Doctors say she is exhibiting common symptoms of the disease and expect to formally diagnose her with the virus when her results come back on Tuesday morning.

The products which have been pulled from shelves are Nanna's Mixed Berries 1 kilogram packets, and the 300 and 500 gram varieties of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries.  

'Over the last two to three weeks I've been getting quite sick and I just thought it was a flu,' Ms Sims revealed.

'Last night I just couldn't really swallow anymore and I was going to make a frozen drink like I have been for the last four to six weeks,' she added added.

After her partner Trevor alerted her to the health warning which had been issued when he saw Ms Sims with a packet of Nanna's berries - he rushed her to hospital.

Since her admission her eyelids have turned yellow and she is exhibiting signs of jaundice.

Ms Sims is also suffering from chronic tonsillitis and a chest infection - likely a result of her body fighting multiple infections.

'I'm massively jaundice and my liver's pretty crappy and these are the first signs of hep A from the berries,' Ms Sims revealed. 

Though still awaiting the definitive results of her blood tests, Ms Sims said her doctor was almost certain she had hepatitis A, news which left her in tears.

The Ballarat woman said she feels betrayed by the food company, and claims she was misled over the origin of the product which she thought were Australian made.

'I'm really angry', Ms Sims said before adding 'It's disgusting. We're in Australia - we have our own resources.' 

She now faces at least a week of unpaid leave from her casual job, is on heavy antibiotics and can't even kiss her partner.

Ms Sims said she was beside herself when she found out, especially since she and partner Trevor visited his sick mother in hospital just last week. She hopes that she did not pass on any virus.

The Ballarat woman decided to share her story in the hopes of alerting others of the dangers. 

'I thought I’m going to tell someone … if I didn't know about it then how many other people don’t know,' she revealed.

In recent days the frozen berry products have been pulled from supermarket shelves after increasing numbers of people contracted the potentially deadly hepatitis A virus after consuming the fruit.

The first items to be pulled were 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries after five adults, three in Victoria and two in NSW, fell ill after eating the fruit.

On Sunday Patties Foods also recalled a number of their products, the 300 gram and 500 gram varieties of their Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. 

Patties Foods CEO Steven Chaur said the wider recall was a precautionary measure until the results of further laboratory testing came back.  

'We have decided that all our frozen Mixed Berries should be recalled until such time as we receive the results of further laboratory tests,' Mr Chaur said.

'The recall is an important step to ensure public safety and confidence.'

The berries, which are sold in major supermarkets including Woolworths, Coles and IGA stores, are packed in China and distributed in Australia by Patties Foods, based in Bairnsdale in southeast Victoria.

Meantime Australian farmers say the outbreak from frozen the berries imported from China illustrates the risks involved with imported food and called on consumers to always buy homegrown products.

Victorian Farmers Federation president Peter Tuohey said not all imported food adhered to Australia's strict guidelines which were some of the best health and safety standards in the world.

Mr Tuohey urged consumers to always buy Australian made products but conceded identifying those products could be quite challenging.

'I can only assume that this company is using Chinese berries because they are offering a lower market price,' he told The Herald Sun. 'Berries are certainly in season in Australia.' 

He said that it was likely the berries were contaminated when they were first picked.

'They may have been placed on the ground where rats and other vermin could have caused the problem,' he said.

'Unfortunately, Australian Customs don't test every batch, they only check a certain percentage of shipments.'

The health department has also told the company to recall the product that contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile. 

Hepatitis A is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth.

Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, says frozen berries have been tied to outbreaks of the virus in the past.

'Hepatitis A virus infection is uncommon and normally associated with travel to countries affected by endemic hepatitis A,' she said in a statement on Saturday.

'The only common link between the cases is consumption of this product - there is no overseas travel or common restaurant exposure.' 

NSW Health's Communicable Diseases Branch director Dr Vicky Shepherd said an investigation by all health agencies would help determine how many people have been affected - although some may not be struck down with the infection for a few weeks. 

Symptoms of Hepatitis A include abdominal pain, nausea and fever as well as yellow skin and eyes.
