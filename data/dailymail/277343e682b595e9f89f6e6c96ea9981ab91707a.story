Parents should continuing reading to their children up to the age of nine and beyond to help boost their academic results, according to new research.

The study by the Oxford University Press found a sharp decline in the numbers of parents reading bedtime stories after their children had begun to master books themselves, usually around the age of seven.

But experts said that even when pupils have learned the basics, adults still had a vital role.

Book at bedtime: Parents should continue reading to their children to the age of nine and beyond to help boost their academic results, yet there has been a sharp decline in the numbers who do, according to new research

James Clements, a leading school adviser on reading, said: ‘Between the ages of seven and nine, parents can make a huge impact. This age provides an opportunity for them to support their child with developing a love of reading.

The difference that enjoying reading regularly can make in children’s achievement extends across the curriculum.’

Separate research also found that children who read for fun are more likely to do better in maths and English than youngsters who rarely pick up a book.

The findings come days after another 
study revealed that the traditional bedtime story is dying out, with a 
third of parents never reading to their children at night.

Just 64 per cent of those with children under seven read to them at all, and of those, a mere one in five get a book out every night.

The study showed the average modern day child gets three bedtime stories a week.

But a quarter of a milllion children aged seven or under, or just under five per cent, do not own a single book.

In contrast, 91 per cent of those parents said they were read regular stories as a child, according to the research by online retailer Littlewoods.com.

Businessman David Hodges, 48, admitted he struggles to find time to read to his two children.

Mr Hodges, of Southampton, Hanmpshire, said: 'I tended to get back too late from work and the children were already in bed.

'If they were lucky their mother had time to read them a story but it could be a real struggle to get them both fed and ready for bed in time.'
