Controversy: Director Quentin Tarantino shocked press backstage at the Golden Globes by using the N-word

Quentin Tarantino has stirred further controversy in the wake of his slavery-themed movie Django Unchained by using the 'N-word' backstage at the Golden Globes.

The cult movie director, who won the award for best screenplay, shocked gathered press at the Hollywood event with his use of the word, before saying that the U.S. prison system is 'modern slavery'.

Tarantino, renowned for his risqué directorial decisions, has walked an even finer line with Django Unchained.

The spaghetti Western starring Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington and Christoph Waltz sees characters use the N-word more that 100 times.

Tarantino defended his inclusion of the word in the script - and repeated it in front of gathered reporters.

'They think I should soften it, that I should lie, that I should massage,' he told the Hollywood Reporter. 

'I would never do that when it comes to my characters.'

The director also said that slavery continues in the U.S. - it has just taken on a different form.

'If you go to Malaysia, there's sexual slavery going on in places like that, but I'm more concerned about the slavery that is going on in America,' he said.

'The drug laws that have put so many black males in jail that wouldn't have existed in the `70s, that is slavery. It is just straight up slavery as far as I'm concerned.'

The director has made the point in earlier interviews. While on a Canadian talk show in December, Tarantino said: 'This whole thing of this ''war on drugs''
and the mass incarcerations that have happened pretty much for the last 40
years has just decimated the black male population.

'It’s slavery, it is just, it’s
just slavery through and through, and it’s just the same fear of the black male
that existed back in the 1800s.'

Despite winning two awards on Sunday night at the awards ceremony in Hollywood - one for Tarantino and best supporting actor for Christoph Waltz - Django Unchained has been met with a mixed reception.

Director Spike Lee deemed the film 'disrespectful' and blasted the feature for insulting his 'ancestors'.

Lee wrote on Twitter last month: 'American Slavery Was Not A Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. It Was A Holocaust. My Ancestors Are Slaves.Stolen From Africa. I Will Honor Them.'

Django Unchained, which opened on Christmas Day, sees Foxx as a slave Django Freeman, who fights for his freedom and to be reunited with his wife Broomhilda (Washington), who was sold to brutal plantation owner Calvin J Candie (DiCaprio).

Waltz, who plays a bounty hunter who trains Foxx's character, backed Tarantino's directorial choices given the controversial subject matter of slavery.

He told the Hollywood press: 'It should be 
controversial if you make a movie about a story against the backdrop of 
slavery.

'You better be prepared for a controversial 
discussion. I wish more movies gave us an opportunity to talk about 
subjects that matter to us today.'

His co-star Jamie Foxx opened up last month about the struggles he had on set with the racial slur constantly being repeated.

The 45-year-old actor told Jay Leno last month: 'It was a deep movie what I had to learn though was the slavery part of it was tough. I've worked so hard to get where I am as black man - strong and handling my business in 2011/2012.

'That was tough for me to act like I can't read, or be subservient to someone or to hear the N-word over and over again which is what I asked for because that's the way they labelled them at that time.'
