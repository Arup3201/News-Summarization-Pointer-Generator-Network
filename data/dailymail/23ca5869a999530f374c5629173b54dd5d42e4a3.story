Christie Brinkley, still fresh-faced at 60, has announced plans to launch a new anti-aging skincare line.

The model, who spent 25 years as the face of Cover Girl, will release Christie Brinkley Authentic Skincare, a line of eight products, on HSN in early March, and in Kohl’s later that month.

Ms Brinkley told WWD that she considers herself lucky to have such flawless skin after spending years in the sun, admitting that she regrets doling out some questionable advice in her 1983 tome Christie Brinkley’s Outdoor Beauty and Fitness Book.

'I was actually telling people how droplets of water would make them tan faster,' she recalled.

The new products, which range in price from $22.95 to $69.95, include a day cream, night treatment, exfoliating polish, eye serum, neck treatment, wrinkle smoother, smoothing primer and facial cleansing wash.

The collection, which she developed with dermatologist Doris Day, will be vegan to reflect Ms Brinkley's own lifestyle.

The products feature broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection as well as Bio-Copper Complex, a proprietary ingredient that the pair claim will revitalize skin and offer protection from infrared solar rays.

'It was very important to me that we formulated something that, as much as is possible, protected against future sun damage,' Ms Brinkley said.

Anne Martin-Vachon, HSN's chief merchandising officer, said that the model embodies three qualities she values highly: 'successful brand, great product and great storyteller'.

'She has all sorts of stories, on everything from her line to her modeling career to her kids...She has first-to-market technology in the line, which is a fair trade, eco-friendly line that doesn’t test on animals. And she is incredibly passionate about this line,' she said.

Ms Brinkley revealed her skincare regimen to Harper's Bazaar back in March, saying: 'My routine is very simple: I cleanse, exfoliate, and moisturize.

'I use Olay's Regenerist line and Clarins neck cream [$86], and I'm religious about wearing sunscreen daily. When I started modeling I was told to tan, but I always protected my face. Right now I use an SPF I'm formulating for my own skin-care line that I hope will be available in six months. I used to be big on fruit acid facials, but my skin is really clear these days. I also drink tons of water to keep my skin hydrated.'

The svelte stunner, who rose to fame as a Sports Illustrated model in the late Seventies, celebrated her 60th birthday in February by posing in a swimsuit on the cover of People.

She told the magazine that her three children, 28-year-old Alexa Ray Joel, 19-year-old Jack Brinkley-Cook, and 16-year-old Sailor Brinkley-Cook, keep her young.

'Because I'm an older mom, I have a responsibility to my kids as well as myself. I want to be there for them.'
