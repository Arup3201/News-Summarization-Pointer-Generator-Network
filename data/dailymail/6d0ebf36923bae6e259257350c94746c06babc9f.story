A woman was taken to a hospital after an exorcism-gone-wrong in Wyoming.

After being sprayed with Holy Water during an exorcism to rid a 'biting' demon, a 31-year-old woman stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest last week in a home near Riverton, Wy., according to KTAK radio.

The Fremont County Emergency Dispatch
 Center received a 911 call on June 11 reporting a woman in a home on 
Firethorn Lane near Riverton was possessed by a 'poltergeist' while 
others performed an exorcism, KDLY/KOVE reported.

But when a deputy arrived, the woman was breathing.

Those performing the exorcism told 
police a demon had broken windows and dishes and bitten people inside 
the home for two days, but the deputy didn't report any evidence of 
criminal or supernatural activity.

The deputy also didn't find that any of the home's occupants had been bitten.

The woman was taken to a nearby hospital and was in stable condition the next day.

Other exorcisms have not ended so favorably for the supposedly-possessed.

Earlier
 this month, a Virginia man was sentenced to more than 20 years for 
killing his 2-year-old daughter during an exorcism. He told police that 
an evil spirit entered his body, forcing him to punch his daughter over 
and over, when he tried to rid her of a demon, according to the Associated Press.

In March 2012, a London couple were found guilty of murdering 15-year-old boy they accused of using witchcraft. The teen drowned on Christmas Day in 2010 as the couple attempted to exorcise him in a bath, BBC reported.

In 2005, a 23-year-old Romanian nun died of suffocation and dehydration when a priest bound her to a cross and gagged her with a towel, according to Discovery News. The priest was trying to drive away the devil when the woman said she heard him saying she was sinful.Â 

An 8-year-old autistic boy in Milwaukee, Wis., died of asphyxiation in August 2003 after church members bound him in sheets in an attempt to exorcise spirits they believed caused his condition.
