The boss of a Christian TV network has stepped down from his role because of a ‘moral failure’ in his marriage.

Rory Alec said he was handing over the running of God TV, a worldwide network that got its start in Britain, to his wife Wendy.

He did not elaborate – but religious figures have quit similar positions in the past after having extramarital affairs.

Alec and his wife Wendy, who launched God TV from their London home in 1996, have been married for 27 years.

In a brief statement, South African-born Alec said: ‘After 20 years of service, I have had a moral failure this year. For this reason, I am stepping down. 

'Please forgive me for the disappointment I’ve caused, but I know your eyes are on Jesus who is the author and finisher of your faith and not on me, an imperfect man.

‘It is with a heavy heart that I confirm my season with God TV is over for now.’

Within hours, his name was removed from the list of leaders on God TV’s webpage. Mrs Alec said she would explain the reasons for his departure with ‘transparency and authenticity’ in a broadcast from the network’s main studio in Jerusalem this week.

Viewers expressed their support on God TV’s Facebook page. 

‘Rory and Wendy we stand with you in prayer for restoration, reconciliation and forgiveness!’ wrote Victoria Webster-West.

‘Rory thank you for stepping down in honesty during this time of God’s dealing with your heart. Wendy all of our love and support. You’ve both done so much to build God’s kingdom and our prayers cover you!’

Linda Ford wrote: ‘So sorry for you both. We are all vulnerable to temptation, but there is forgiveness and restoration? This is my prayer for you both and may you both know the love, comfort and Shalom peace of The Lord Jesus at this very sad and difficult time.’ Another said: ‘God’s Grace covers a multitude of sins – we are made of flesh and we fail but God’s grace heals all.’

God TV can be seen in more than 60 countries and is popular in the US, where it competes with other religious broadcasters. It claims to reach more than 900million people with its mixture of sermons and uplifting stories of people saved by faith. The Alecs feature regularly along with US-based evangelists.

Last year, the couple appeared in a show that attempted to exorcise ‘demons’ from President Obama to free him from ‘Jezebel’s clutches’.

They were planning to open an office and a prayer revival centre in a former nightclub in Plymouth, Devon. Sources at the network said the revival centre would go ahead despite Alec’s sudden departure.

The couple, who are in their 40s, met as singers on the cabaret circuit in South Africa.

Mrs Alec was born in London but grew up in Durban, South Africa, and became a devout Christian after seeing the face of Jesus in a mirror in the lavatory of a nightclub where she was singing.

The couple decided to set up a Christian TV channel in Europe after hearing a prophecy that they would do so.

They launched God TV with £140,000 in savings and it quickly became popular with US evangelists who paid to appear and gain access to European audiences.

The couple still have a home in London but spend much of their time in Jerusalem at God TV’s main studio. One of the first Christian broadcasters in Britain, God TV can be viewed online and on its Sky television channel

Alec is the latest US TV preacher to be involved in scandal. Jim Bakker quit after being caught using prostitutes, while Jimmy Swaggart resigned over an affair.
