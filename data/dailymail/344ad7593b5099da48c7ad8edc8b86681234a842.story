Shelly Sterling will accept offers this week to buy the LA Clippers after meeting with potential buyer Steve Ballmer on Sunday, it has been claimed.

Ballmer, a former Microsoft CEO thought to be worth $20billion (£11.8billion), is leading a group of investors looking to buy the sports franchise and reportedly spoke with Sterling on Sunday in a meeting overseen by the NBA.

Shelly has committed to offloading the team, which could be worth $1.5billion, after her husband Donald was recorded making racist remarks leading to the NBA banning him from the league.

Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, reported to be worth $20billion, is thought to be the frontrunner in talks after reportedly meeting with Shelly on Sunday

According to TMZ sports, Shelly and her lawyer Pierce O'Donnell have told potential buyers they are looking to do a deal this week, and NBA commissioner Adam Silver is aware of their intentions.

Ballmer is the frontrunner, but other interested parties are thought to include the Grant Hill Group -  a collection of investors lead by former NBA star Hill - and Magic Johnson and the Guggenheim partners - a financial investment group from Chicago, lead by another basketball great.

Patrick Soon-Shiong, a surgeon, professor and billionaire businessman, is also rumoured to be interested, as is music and cinema executive David Geffen and software magnate Larry Ellison.

Ballmer's apparent lead in securing a deal has worried some Clippers fans, who fear the Seattle-based billionaire could move the team up north.

He previously tried to move the Sacramento Kings to the emerald city after putting in a failed bid in 2009, and tried to keep the Sonics in Seattle in 2008 with another purchase which ultimately failed.

However Shelly has previously said she would not be willing to sell the franchise to anyone considering moving it out of LA, and Ballmer has sought to reassure fans by saying he has no plans to relocated the Clippers.

He said: 'If the opportunity is outside of Seattle, so be it. I will learn 
about any team that comes up for sale at this point.

'If I get interested in the Clippers, it would be 
for Los Angeles. I don't work anymore, so I have more geographic 
flexibility than I did a year, year-and-a half ago. Moving them anywhere
 else would be value-destructive.'

The
 news comes after the NBA stated on Friday that it would go through with
 a June 3 hearing to terminate Donald Sterling's ownership following his
 lifetime ban.

Previously, the league stated a sale would only be considered if Shelly chose to sell it in its entirety.

The sale will be handled by Sterling's attorney Pierce O'Donnell in partnership with Bob Baradan.
