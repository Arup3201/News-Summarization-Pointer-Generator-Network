A ban on 'Nazis' attending a Second World War-themed event celebrating the Dambusters anniversary failed to stop people strutting around in SS uniform over the weekend.

Organisers of the 1940s Weekend at Haworth, West Yorkshire, faced complaints last year from a party of German tourists about the flaunting of regalia linked to the Holocaust.

This year figures wearing leather 
coats and uniforms featuring the 'Death’s Head' insignia of the SS camp 
guards were again spotted among the crowds.

Businesses in the town were given signs saying 'No Nazi or SS Insignia or Uniform on these premises' for this year's event. The man in the centre is dressed in Luftwaffe

Signs warning 'No Nazi or SS Insignia or uniforms on these premises' were displayed on shops, pubs and camp sites.

Haworth is a tourist hotspot because of its links with the Bronte family and this year organisers were determined to avoid a repeat of last year’s controversy.

Businesses all over the town, were given signs saying Nazi or SS uniforms 'not welcome' in a bid to avoid 'unnecessary offence'.

But again the event – which attracts 25,000 visitors a year and raises thousands of pounds for charity – was marred by visitors dressing up as members of Hitler’s elite SS.

As well as being notorious for their ruthlessness, the SS also guarded the concentration camps.

One of the weekend organisers, Emma Cox, said those involved were getting more stubborn about flaunting their regalia every year.

She said: 'This is a very controversial issue. Lots of people who come to the weekend are re-enactors recreating military, civilian, and other features of the era.

'Then there are people who come as spectators who are mainly local people but some from further afield.

'Every year there are a few people who come in SS Uniforms which is nothing to do with the re-enactments.

'It is just about getting dressed up as SS people.

'Some people find this quite upsetting in what is meant to be a celebration of the Home Front spirit.

'Apart from anything there would not have been any SS in England at the time.

'These people who come dressed as SS have been getting very uptight that other people do not want them to come.

'They seem to be getting more determined to get dressed up in their SS uniforms and this is an open and public event.

'So it is just not appropriate – or practical – to vet the thousands of people coming into the village.

'It is okay to come dressed as a German soldier. But everyone knows the SS was different. They were the people running the concentration camps.

'It’s a problem because this is a public event which is supposed to be inclusive.'

The 1940s weekend is an annual Second World War-themed event that has been running for 18 years

Bronte Society Chairman Sally 
McDonald said: 'It is regrettable if they have attended in those sort of
costumes. It is a tremendous weekend that brings all of Haworth 
together.

'So if offence is caused it more than
unfortunate. It casts a bit of a shadow over what is a hugely 
successful weekend which raises a tremendous amount for charity.

'The people who organise it want to 
raise the profile of Haworth and raise money for charity. It brings in 
huge numbers of visitors to Haworth. If not everyone is in the correct 
spirit of the weekend that is most regrettable.

'The traders of Haworth put polite notices in the weekend asking people not to don these outfits.

'Let's hope in the future everyone respects what is being done and has fun in the right way.'

Attendees are allowed to wear German military uniforms, but the SS is a sensitive matter because of their links to genocide and other horrific war crimes

Organisers have said there is no law against wearing the uniforms so it was not possible to impose an outright ban.

This year’s event was particularly sensitive since it was taking place on the 70th anniversary of the Dambuster’s raid and included a Dambuster's theme.

All proceeds raised from the weekend will be donated to the armed forces charity, the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Families Association.

It is hoped to match or exceed the £25,000 raised last year for Help for Heroes.

Founded in 1925, the 'Schutzstaffel', German for 'Protective Echelon', initially served as Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguards, later becoming one of the most powerful and feared organizations in all of Nazi Germany.

Heinrich Himmler, a militant anti-Semite, became head of the SS in 1929 and expanded the group's role and size.Recruits had to prove their 'racial purity' and were also taught they were the not only the elite of Nazi Party but also of all humankind.

By the start of the Second World War the SS had more than 250,000 members and multiple subdivisions, engaged in activities ranging from intelligence operations to running Nazi concentration camps. The soldiers of the SS committed many atrocities during World War II. The concentration camp system was set up in the 1930s by Theodor Eicke of the SS.

Thousands of SS men were also drafted to help exterminate the Jews of Eastern Europe, participating in mass killings or guarding ghetto districts where Jews from the west were concentrated before being sent to death camps. They played a major role in the mass murders in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943.Jews were routinely executed or maltreated in areas controlled by SS units.At the end of the war many leading members of the SS committed suicide. Those that were captured were tried at the Nuremburg war crimes trials.
