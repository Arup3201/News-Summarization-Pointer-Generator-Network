Authorities engaged in a four-hour standoff in a Texas town with a woman on Thursday.

Eleouise Adcock, 90, of Channelview pointed a shotgun at construction workers earlier that morning, KPRC reported. 

A SWAT team was called in after they reported her to authorities, the station said.

'[The construction workers] told us she has pointed weapons at them before,' Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Thomas Gilliland told KPRC.

'They didn’t tell anyone about it the first few times. This time they felt she was much more angry about them being here working and excavating the dirt.'

A neighbor told the station Adcock has been trying to fend off a company that has been buying property near her home, whose workers were nearby that day.

After four hours, 'She talked for a little while [with an officer], she came and went back into the home, came back outside and at that point she put the shotgun down,’ Gilliland told the station.

Adcock's shotgun was snatched away by the SWAT team and she was removed from the scene in a stretcher, KPRC reported.

A request to the sheriff's office for more information was not immediately answered.
