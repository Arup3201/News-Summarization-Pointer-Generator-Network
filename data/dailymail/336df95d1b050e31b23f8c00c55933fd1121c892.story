Luis Suarez believes he will leave Liverpool this summer in a £65million move to Real Madrid – though Barcelona have now also entered the race to sign him.

The Liverpool striker, whose two goals effectively finished off England’s World Cup campaign on Thursday in Sao Paulo, has told friends that there is a £65million release clause in his contract and that he is confident of joining Madrid, who have indicated they will make an offer to Liverpool.

However, the situation has now been complicated by Barcelona’s interest, given that the family of his wife, Sofia, lives near the city in the suburb of Castelldefels. Nevertheless, Suarez appears to be confident that he will be leaving Liverpool – although the club will clearly resist any move and attempt to keep him.

Barcelona hope that they can prise him away by offering Chile striker Alexis Sanchez in exchange, a player who has interested Liverpool. Losing Suarez would clearly be a massive blow for Liverpool, who are preparing for the Champions League after their second place finish last season.

However, Liverpool owner John W Henry was remarkably resolute last season when Arsenal attempted to sign Suarez, refusing to buckle and insisting that the player would stay. Eventually Suarez agreed and signed a new four and year contract last season, meaning negotiations are likely to be long and fraught over the next two months.
