Bayern Munich striker Claudio Pizarro has agreed to stay for another year at the club.

The Bundesliga side says that the 35-year-old Peruvian extended a contract which was due to expire on June 30.

Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says 'Claudio again showed this season how dangerous he is in front of goal and how important he is for the team.'

Pizarro made only six Bundesliga starts for Bayern last season, with 11 substitute appearances, but still managed to score 10 goals and set up three more.

Pizarro says 'I am very proud that I can play for Bayern next year" and "for me there is no better team in the world.'

The veteran forward is in his second stint at Bayern. Next season will be his ninth with the club.
