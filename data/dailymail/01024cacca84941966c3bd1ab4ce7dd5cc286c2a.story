Ginia Rinehart, the daughter of Australia's richest woman, discovered her close friend and minder Jerry Rouwhorst unconscious at the Dorchester Hotel on March 16

The heiress to an £11billion mining fortune has been left devastated by the death of her Australian bodyguard after a suspected suicide attempt in her suite at the Dorchester hotel.

Ginia Rinehart, the daughter of Australia's richest woman, discovered her close friend and minder Jerry Rouwhorst unconscious in her room after returning from a night out in London on March 16.

The 27-year-old, who will inherit the billions amassed by her mining magnate family, raised the alarm finding the 35-year-old collapsed on the floor.

Police officers and paramedics were called to the suite at the five-star hotel, which is often used by wealthy businessmen and rich celebrities and where rooms can cost up to £4,000 a night.

Mr Rouwhorst was taken to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington but died three days later after his family flew to London and his life support machine was switched off.

Scotland Yard said today his death was being treated as ‘non-suspicious’.

A spokesman said: ‘Police were called by London Ambulance Service on Sunday 16 March to the Dorchester Hotel to reports of an injured male.

‘Police and London Ambulance Service attended and the man was taken to hospital.

‘Police have since been notified that he died on the 19 March.

‘The death is being treated as non-suspicious.’

Mr Rouwhorst was an ex-special forces solider who received a bravery award just two days prior to his death for saving a man’s life during an Asian riot in 2007.

It is understood he had pulled a man away from danger in East Timor and got him to hospital despite being attacked by a mob himself.

He was said to be a close friend of Miss Rinehart and her well-known family in Australia, who are said to be shocked by the news.

Although it is believed he died in a suspected suicide bid, it is not clear if it was intentional.  

A spokesman for Miss Rinehart told The Sydney Morning Herald: ‘Jerry was a good person and a great Australian, proven by his bravery during his service.

‘He also has a family who are dealing with his sad loss, so we'd ask that privacy, decency and consideration be shown to them.’

A death notice in Tasmania's The Advocate newspaper last week said: ‘Jerry flashed like a meteor across the sky ... and burnt out too soon.’

No suicide note was found at the scene prior to Mr Rouwhorst’s death and the circumstances surrounding his death are unclear.

Friends are said to have described him as ‘a perfectly normal healthy guy’, with one friend telling The Sun: ‘Ginia loved him to bits. She is totally devastated about what happened.’

An inquest into Mr Rouwhorst's death was opened on Wednesday but was adjourned to June 12 at Westminster Coroner's Court.

It is understood the Tasmanian-born bodyguard’s family have arranged for his body to be returned to his birth country for a private funeral service.

Miss Rinehart, who is the youngest of mining magnate Gina Rinehart's four children and the one to side with her mother throughout the family's bitter legal feud, has since reunited with her family in Paris.

MailOnline has contacted Dorchester Hotel representatives for a comment.

The Rinehart family – one of the richest families in the world - have captured the public’s attention in Australia with an on-going inner legal dispute which has seen the private lives of each of them rolled out into the public eye.

Georgina Hope ‘Gina’ Rinehart, 60, is an Australian mining heiress who inherited the empire left from her father, mining magnate Lang Hancock.

Mr Hancock – a household name in Australia – is credited with discovering the world's largest deposit of iron ore in Pilbara, Western Australia.

In 1988, Mr Hancock established the Hope Margaret Hancock Trust, nominating daughter Gina as a trustee, with his four grandchildren named as beneficiaries.

Since her father’s passing in 1992, Gina has been named Australia’s richest woman several times in a number of billionaire rich lists.

After taking over the chairmanship of the family’s flagship company, she has multiplied her fortune – including by acquiring and developing new mining tenements and developing thermal coal projects as well as a host of other projects.

During 2011, both Forbes Asia and Business Review Weekly reported that Gina – dubbed the ‘Iron Lady’ - was Australia's wealthiest person and in 2013 she was revealed as the fourth richest woman in the whole world.

However, fortune has brought tribulations to the Rinehart family who have found themselves at the centre of a family legal battle.

Two of Gina's children are seeking to remove her as the sole trustee of the pool that holds an almost one-quarter share in Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd, one of the world's largest privately-owned mining companies.

Details about the family feud have spilled out into the media over the last couple of years, with email correspondence between the rifting children emerging from court hearings.

Ms Rinehart had previously tried unsuccessfully to have the court hearings held behind closed doors.

However, she lost a court bid to throw out the lawsuit and it was reported she announced she wanted to step down as trustee during a hearing in October 2013.

Justice Paul Brereton of the New South Wales Supreme Court ruled that the case should go to a full trial at a date yet to be determined.
