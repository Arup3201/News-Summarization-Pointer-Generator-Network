They have always been the closest of divorcees – and now the Duke and Duchess of York may have rekindled their romance.

Friends say Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah, both 53, have found love again, almost two decades after their marriage ended.

The
 Duchess, who has continued to live at Royal Lodge in Windsor with the 
Duke, issued a strongly worded denial following reports they were a 
couple again.

Together again: Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, pictured in 1995 shortly before their divorce, are said to have rekindled their romance

Wedding bells: Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, pictured on their wedding day in 1986 at Westminster Abbey, have been living together at the Royal Lodge in Berkshire

Royal ride: Fergie was driven to the airport by her former husband Prince Andrew while her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie travelled in the back seat ahead of a family visit to Balmoral

Back in the fold: The once disgraced Duchess of York flew to Balmoral to spend the weekend with the Queen

But friends have described them as so close that many consider a remarriage is on the cards.One said: ‘Mark my words, they will remarry. It is only a matter of time.’

The appearance of Sarah at Balmoral earlier this month only fuelled the speculation about the strength of their relationship.

Both Andrew and Sarah joined daughters Beatrice, 25, and Eugenie, 23, for a weekend at the Queen’s Scottish Highlands retreat.

It
 was Sarah’s first invitation back to the castle since 1992 when 
newspaper photographs were published showing her ‘financial adviser’ 
John Bryan sucking her toes. She was staying at Balmoral at the time.

Despite
 her divorce and subsequent exclusion from the Royal Family’s inner 
circle, the Duke and Duchess have always remained on friendly terms.

Both have had other relationships but friends said neither had found lasting happiness after their divorce in 1996.

Royal opinion: The Queen has long been said to have remained fond of her former daughter-in-law, but Prince Philip is said to be baffled by Fergie and Prince Andrew's relationship

While she has still visited Balmoral since her divorce, it is thought to be the first time she has been invited to stay in the main castle on the Queen's estate since her marriage ended in 1996

The
 Duchess was involved with Italian Count Gaddo della Gherardesca and 
most recently Norwegian tycoon Geir Frantzen, who owns frozen food 
company Findus.

Andrew has been linked to several wealthy socialites, most notably Kazakh entrepreneur Goga Ashkenazi.

Friends have suggested that the couple’s continuing ‘bond’ may have seen off their other relationships.

In
 1999 the Duchess told an interviewer: ‘There was no reason for Andrew 
and I to get divorced; there wasn’t another person in our lives to go 
to.

'We got divorced 
because I had to go out to work, and Andrew and I believed that it 
wasn’t right for me to be commercial while I was still in the Royal 
Family.’

Prince Andrew has continued to provide financial support for his ex-wife and in a 2009 interview he did not rule out remarrying.

Talking point: The Duke and Duchess of York, pictured together in London in 2000, have both previously spoken about getting married again

Joint effort: The Duchess of York, seen holding her second daughter Princess Eugenie in 1990, and Prince Andrew have raised their two daughters together

‘Do
 we have to be married?’ he said. ‘Well, let’s put it another way, I can
 neither confirm nor deny the possibility. We have two great children. 
We still look after them.’ 

Some
 friends said they believed the couple might remarry. One said: ‘It 
wouldn’t surprise me at all. They are a wonderful couple together and, 
better still, pretty amazing parents.’ 

Another, who saw them recently, said: ‘There has always been this bond between them and they are incredibly close.

'It
 is, understandably, strange to some that they still live together so 
many years after their divorce, but they really do get on brilliantly 
and are hugely supportive of each other. Their biggest bond, however, is
 the girls.’

Another source
 said: ‘Balmoral wasn’t about them being back together, that was about 
the Royal Family recognising that she had tried to turn her life around 
and that they are still a family unit after all these years.’

A
 spokesman for the Duchess ruled out a new relationship between the 
pair. He said: ‘They continue to be joint parents and best friends and 
try to set the best example for the girls.’

Close: The Queen, pictured next to Fergie at Princess Eugenie's christening at Sandringham in 1990, is said to remained fond of her daughter-in-law despite the scandals

Wedding bells: The Duke of York and Duchess of York, pictured on their wedding day in 1986, are said to be considering  getting married for a second time

On good terms: Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, pictured on their wedding day on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, have remained close since their divorce

It's one of the wildest, most romantic spots on earth.

Little wonder, then, that Botswana is the place that Prince Harry returns to time and time again with the lady in his life. Every one of them.

He has just treated his latest girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, to a week-long safari holiday in the African wilderness.

Unfortunately for her, though, it was the very same spot he frequently romanced his ex-girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, and has holidayed with his once rumoured love interest, Natalie Pinkham.

The couple are understood to have spent several glorious days sailing up and down the picturesque Okavango Delta on a rickety houseboat called the Kubu Queen, sleeping out under the stars.

It was the very same boat that the prince was photographed on with Miss Davy in 2008.

Harry, 28, and Cressida, 24, were accompanied by Harry’s cousin, Princess Eugenie, and her boyfriend Jack Brooksbank.

It is believed Eugenie first introduced the prince to her friend.

The group enjoyed the odd spot of fishing and had meals cooked for them by an on-board chef.

It is understood that Cressida and Eugenie flew out to Africa together from London early last week, while Harry travelled from Angola.
