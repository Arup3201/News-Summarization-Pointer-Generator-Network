Police have clocked 22,000 speeding drivers through a village in just 16 days. 

Officers had told villagers armed with a speed gun to stop clocking drivers breaking the law in Ticknall, Derbyshire - because they couldn't cope with the paperwork.

But after stepping in to conduct their own speed survey, police found that more than one in six motorists - 22,114 out of 118,107 - were breaking the 30mph limit. 

Police have clocked 22,000 speeding drivers through the village of Ticknall, Derbyshire, in just 16 days

Residents in the village used speed gun to catch drivers who break the 30mph limit on the A514, who were then sent warning letters from the force saying they have breached the limit and risk prosecution if they did again.

Campaigner Kevin Harris welcomed the figures released by Derbyshire Police's Casualty Reduction Enforcement Support Team (CREST).

He said: 'I will be attending Derbyshire County Council's Cabinet meeting later this month with our member Linda Chilton, to put questions to them about highways.

'These figures complement our figures. The figures have not surprised us because we live on this road so we know what it is like.'

The villagers were given the gun by officers to catch speeding motorists who break the 30mph limit through their village.

But they were so proficient with their speed gun that it was taken off them. 

They carried out 10 speeding operations on the A514 main road through the village clocking a total of around 200 motorists. 

Over a 16-day period, from December 3 to 18, CREST undertook a speed survey on the A514 Main Street, Ticknall.

The survey consisted of two rubber tubes being fixed across the road and connected to a survey counter that collected data including traffic flow and speed of traffic.

Members from the CREST team were quick to point out that this is not a 'method of speed enforcement' but is used for data collection purposes.

For the entire 16-day period, 118,107 were tracked using the road.

A total of 17,399 vehicles (or 14.7 per cent) were travelling at a speed greater than 36mph.

An additional of 4,715 vehicles (or four per cent) were travelling above 40mph.

Mr Harris added: 'We haven't done our speedwatch for a while and you can see that speeds are going up again.

'We want to know what can be done. They say they cannot do an Operation Safedrive because there is nowhere to pull vehicles over and we only have one PCSO for the area.

But after stepping in to conduct their own speed survey, police found that more than one in six motorists - 22,114 out of 118,107 - were breaking the 30mph limit through the picturesque village

'We will definitely keep doing our speedwatch.'

Mr Harris and his volunteers recently made national headlines after they were told to scale down the amount of times they conduct their speedwatch sessions as it was creating too much paperwork for police.

He added: 'I feel people are listening but we are not getting the right answers because everyone is saying 'we can't (do this)' because of lack of resources.'

A spokesman for Derbyshire Police responded to claims made by Mr Harris.

He said: 'We appreciate Mr Harris' concerns about the speeding in Ticknall.

'The Derby and Derbyshire Road Safety Partnership will be looking at ways to tackle the speeding in this area. No decisions have been made yet about the best approach to take.'
