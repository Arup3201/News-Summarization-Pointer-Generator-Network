One in three Americans can't name a single branch of the United States government, an embarrassing, new poll has found.

Executive, legislative or judicial would all suffice, but a surprising 35 percent of Americans were stumped by the basic civics question, the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, revealed on Wednesday.

A mere 36 percent of Americans were able to name all three, pollsters discovered.

Survey-takers were even more unlikely to be able to answer other, albeit less rudimentary, questions about the United States government, including what political party controls the upper and lower chambers of Congress and how many votes it takes to overturn a presidential veto.

Do you know which branch of the government operates out of this room? If you don't, you're not alone. A new poll found that a mere 36 percent of Americans could name all three branches of government. (HINT: The people pictured here are Members of Congress)

Most Americans also weren't aware that the Republican Party, led by Ohio Rep. John Boehner, control the House of Representatives

The Republican Party controls the House of Representatives, but only 38 percent of Americans surveyed were aware of that. Half as many, 17 percent, thought that Democrats ruled the roost.

Meanwhile, a plurality of Americans, 44 percent, admitted they had no idea who holds a majority of seats in the House.

Most Americans were also confused about which party runs the Senate, with 38 percent correctly identifying the Democratic Party as the political group in power. Another 20 percent thought Republicans were in charge of the Senate while 42 percent claimed ignorance.

Asked about the procedure for overturning a presidential veto, less than a third of respondents accurately argued that it takes a two-thirds majority vote by both the House and the Senate to overrule the nation's leader.

One in five survey-takers were woefully under-educated about how checks and balances work, as well.

Poll-takers found that 21 percent of Americans think a 5-4 Supreme Court decision goes back to Congress. 

Though the poll was taken in mid-July, it was only just released this Thursday, which was federally recognized as Constitution Day in America.

'Although surveys reflect disapproval of the way Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court are conducting their affairs, the Annenberg survey demonstrates that many know surprisingly little about these branches of government,' Annenberg Public Policy Center Director Kathleen Hall Jamieson said in a statement accompanying the results of the poll.

'This survey offers dramatic evidence of the need for more and better civics education,' Jamieson said. 

The frightening outcome of the civics test inspired APPC to join 25 other non-profit organizations, including the Library of Congress and the National Archives, in creating the Civic Renewal Network.

Survey-takers were even more unlikely to give the correct answer to other civics trivia questions such as how many votes  to overturn a veto
