Alex Salmond's Scottish Nationalist MPs could vote on English laws to prop up a Labour government.

The former First Minister has hinted that the SNP would be prepared to ditch the long-standing convention that its MPs do not vote on laws that only affect England.

Instead they would take part in Commons votes to help Ed Miliband pass laws if Labour falls short of an overall majority in next year's election.

Alex Salmond suggested SNP MPs could vote on English laws to prop up a Labour government

Mr Salmond formally stepped down as SNP leader and First Minister last month after voters in Scotland rejected his dream of independence in September's referendum.

He announced earlier this month his bid to return to Westminster and was unveiled as a candidate for the SNP nomination for the Gordon constituency in Aberdeenshire.

Mr Salmond hopes to steal the seat from the Liberal Democrats, with current Lib Dem MP Sir Malcolm Bruce retiring in May.

Some polls have put the SNP on course to win dozens of seats from Labour, leaving Mr Miliband with a rump of just a handful of MPs north of the border.

Such a result would shatter his hopes of securing a majority in May next year, forcing him to rely on other parties for support.

However, with the Conservatives likely to have the most MPs in England, it would be difficult for a Labour government to pass laws without the support of the SNP – whether in a coalition or a confidence and supply deal.

Such an arrangement, which could see SNP MPs rethink their practice of abstaining in English-only legislation at Westminster, would be on a 'vote by vote' basis.

Mr Salmond pointed to two pieces of legislation not directly affecting Scotland which he opposed when he was an MP: the introduction of foundation hospitals and tuition fees.

He told The Independent: 'There will be many things that come across the Westminster desk that would be of little moment to Scottish people, but will be of great moment to the government of the day.'

Mr Salmond said he would 'lay odds' on a balanced parliament, also known as a hung parliament, which occurs when no party secures an absolute majority of seats.

'That's an opportunity to have delivered to Scotland what we have been promised,' he said.

The former first minister told the Independent that a 'barrel-load' of SNP MPs would win seats at the 2015 general election.

He added that the SNP's key objectives in any negotiations at Westminster after the election would be to ensure the UK's political leaders keep their pledge to transfer powers to Scotland.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he could do a deal with Labour after the election

Nigel Farage has made it clear that he would be ready to do a deal with Labour if Ukip holds the balance of power after next year's general election, but said 'It wouldn't be easy'.

The Ukip leader has previously said that he would 'do a deal with the devil' in order to secure British exit from the European Union.

Speaking on LBC radio, he made clear that any agreement to go into coalition or support a minority government would depend on the parliamentary arithmetic produced by the election next May, rather than by his political sympathy with either of the major parties.

While insisting that he disagreed with Labour leader Ed Miliband on most subjects, Mr Farage said he would be ready to 'do a deal with somebody that I otherwise wouldn't normally do' if it meant restoring the UK's ability to govern itself.

'We are facing, in four-and-a-half months' time, the most uncertain general election that we've seen for many, many decades in this country,' said Mr Farage.

'All the balls are up in the air, chiefly because of the effect Ukip has had on politics.

'Either the Conservatives or the Labour Party will emerge as the biggest party after that election.

'Given our constitutional history and precedent, the monarch would expect the larger of the two parties to attempt to form either a formal coalition or some kind of support mechanism or deal where you can actually have a government there that can get a Budget through Parliament.

'If we find ourselves - and it's an if, of course it is - in a position where we actually do hold the balance of power, whilst everybody thinks it's more likely that it's David Cameron who would need Ukip support, it's not absolutely impossible that it could be Ed Miliband.

'But I disagree with almost everything Mr Miliband stands for and it wouldn't be easy.'
