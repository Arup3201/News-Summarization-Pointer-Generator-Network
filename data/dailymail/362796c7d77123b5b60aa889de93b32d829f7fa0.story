Shrien Dewani could sue South African authorities for attempting to use his sexuality as evidence against him, a lawyer said today.

In their bungled prosecution, state lawyers tried to argue that his liaisons with gay prostitutes revealed a possible motive for wanting his wife murdered as a 'way out' of the marriage.

The move apparently prompted Dewani to reveal on day one of the trial – via a written explanation of his not guilty pleas – intimate details of his private life in a bid to negate the claims. 

It paved the way for his defence team to call for their client's sexuality to be deemed irrelevant to his murder trial - and Judge Jeanette Traverso duly agreed, angrily throwing out their submissions on more than once occasion.

South African lawyer Peter Jordi said Dewani could seek damages if he can show prosecutors had unjustifiably used his sexuality as evidence.

He told MailOnline: 'He could have a case for malicious prosecution.

'Defendants can recover expenses for the harm they have suffered and infringement of rights of personality suffered by being falsely prosecuted.

‘They can make a claim where the prosecution brings up material they know is inadmissible to blacken the character of the accused.' 

Mr Jordi, an attorney at the University of Witwaterstand's law clinic who specialises in claims against the police, said there have been defamation cases against witnesses in the past even when they had told the truth in court.

'If an advocate made a defamatory statement during the course of the proceedings, which was not relevant to the proceedings, then equally the advocate could be held liable,’ he added.

'It is not enough that the information published is truthful. It must be in the interest of the public to receive the information.'

The prosecution had lined up a number of witnesses to testify to Dewani's homosexuality, including Leopold Leisser, known as the German Master, and a detective from Scotland Yard who retrieved a bundle of sexually-explicit e-mails between Dewani and an older man.

But Judge Traverso furiously accused the prosecution of presenting 'irrelevant' evidence when Leisser took the stand to detail sex sessions he and Dewani had in the months leading up to the honeymoon murder.

The allegation that Dewani had told the Birmingham-based escort – who specialises in fetishism and role play - that he needed 'to find a way out' of his engagement to Anni and other conversations they'd shared, was not allowed to be shared with the court, the judge ruled.

Prosecutor Adrian Mopp attempted to argue that since Dewani had consistently described himself as a gay man seeking other gay partners on 'hook-up' websites such as Gaydar and Recon, the court should hear more about his conflicted feelings towards hew new bride.

Judge Jeanette Traverso disagreed and ruled that the e-mails were inadmissible as was the vast majority of what Leopold Leisser was prepared to say. 

She also ruled out as hearsay much of the testimony from Sneha Mashru, Anni’s first cousin, who had been asked to testify about how Anni felt sexually rejected by him. 

However, Mr Jordi said Dewani's chances of a successful claim were slim.

'I would not be prepared to represent him because my advice would be that he has got a weak case.

'It is harder to prove because the onus is on the defendant to show it was malicious.

'In the particular case in question, it seems that the material may have been relevant (it was brought up in the plea explanation by the accused, for example).

'The claimant should be wary of launching proceedings.'

Mannie Witz, a senior defence barrister who specialises in murder cases, said Dewani would face another dilemma if he decided to sue as it would force him into the witness box.

He told MailOnline: 'In such a claim, the onus would be on Dewani to prove that the case against him was malicious, meaning he could not avoid giving evidence under oath.

'He simply couldn't do that, judging by the various versions he has given police over time and now to the court in his plea explanation, he is likely to make a shocking witness.

'No lawyer acting for him would advise him to do that.'
