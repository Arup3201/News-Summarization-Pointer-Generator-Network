A pilot of a private plane was arrested over concerns about the amount of alcohol in his blood yesterday - just two days after another similar incident.

Ian Jennings, 47, from Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport yesterday afternoon after landing a commercial chartered plane.

He has been charged with performing an aviation function when the alcohol in his breath was over the prescribed limited, Norfolk Police said.

Jennings was released on bail to appear at Norwich Magistrates' Court on November 13 where he will face the allegation under the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.

The pilot was privately hired by the owner of the plane - a Canadair CL601-3A Challenger.

It is not currently known who owns the plane or where it had flown from at the time of the incident.

Phil Gadd, a director at Norwich Airport, said: 'We're aware of the incident that took place yesterday and understand it's now being dealt with by the police through criminal proceedings.

'Unlike with scheduled airlines, small chartered flights such as this one are not handled by the airport directly so we don't know much than what's already been said.'  

The incident comes just two days after a Flybe pilot was arrested for being 'drunk' before take on Tuesday.

The 48-year-old pilot had been due to fly from Newquay Airport in Cornwall to London Gatwick when he was held.

A concerned crew member alerted the police, who removed the pilot from the plane, a Bombardier Dash 8 turboprop, and breath-tested him. 

The flight was cancelled and passengers were delayed for up to four hours, with one person missing a connecting flight to Mexico.

The pilot was named locally as Julian Lowden, who describes himself in an online profile as a pilot and former consultant stress engineer. 

In the UK drink drive limit is 80 miligrammes per 100 mililitres.

For pilots the blood/alcohol limit is 20 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.

A spokesman said: 'Flybe can confirm that one of its pilots volunteered to help the police with their inquiries at Newquay Airport yesterday.

'The airline is not able to comment further while the police investigation is taking place.'

For pilots, air crew and air traffic controllers the alcohol limit is 20mg per 100ml of blood. The drink-drive limit for motorists is 80mg. 

Retired commercial pilot Andy Wilkins said he'd never heard of a pilot being arrested before a flight. 'It's very rare,' he said.

'I've never heard of my colleagues being tested - I wasn't. But the rules are very strict. Pilots are allowed a quarter of the limit for drivers.

'We always followed the adage, "eight hours from bottle to throttle" - stop drinking at least eight hours before flying. But pilots are human and everyone is different.'

Last year, a Pakistani International Airlines pilot was jailed for nine months in Britain for being drunk before he was due to fly a plane with 156 people on board.

Irfan Faiz, 55, was found to have three times the legal amount of alcohol in his blood, prosecutors told Leeds Crown Court. 

In the US, 48 year-old American Eagle pilot, Kolbjorn Jarle Kristiansen, was removed from the cockpit after airline employees detected alcohol on his breath on him at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
