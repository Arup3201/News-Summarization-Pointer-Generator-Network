The Iranian nuclear power chief, Ali Akbar Salehi

Iran has accused four workers of trying to sabotage its nuclear power programme, tacitly blaming Israel for the plot.

The Iranian nuclear power chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, said yesterday that the authorities had monitored the suspects as they worked in one of the country’s nuclear facilities and made the arrests at 'exactly the right time'.

Although he did not spell out who he believed was responsible, he blamed 'hostile' nations – usually a reference to either Israel or the U.S. – which were opposed to current diplomatic efforts to resolve the row over Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons ambitions.

As Iran is currently engaged in an all-out charm offensive with America while Israel has warned the world not to trust the Iranians, experts believe it is obvious where Mr Salehi is pointing the finger of blame.

He later claimed Iranian authorities had foiled 'several cases' of similar sabotage attempts in the past 'two or three weeks' but did not elaborate.

'Hostile countries are not interested in finding way out of current situation and they are trying to block agreement on the nuclear case though acts of sabotage.'

Tensions between Israel and Iran have sharpened in recent days with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week denouncing Iran’s attempts to reassure the West over its alleged nuclear weapons ambitions.

Mr Netanyahu also revealed that Israel had arrested a Belgian-Iranian man on charges of spying for Iran.

Israel believes it would be the most likely target of a nuclear-armed Iran. Tehran has accused the Israelis of carrying out a string of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years.

Iran has also claimed the US might be linked to past attacks on its nuclear programme but Mr Salehi suggested the latest alleged plot was tied to those who opposed his country’s diplomatic overtures to Washington.

On Saturday, Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Mr Netanyahu wanted to 'blackmail the world' and stop any progress in nuclear talks with the US and European powers such as Britain and France.

Talks over Iran’s nuclear programme are scheduled to resume next week in Geneva amid hopes of movement on all sides after their historic meetings at the recent United Nations General Assembly.

The US and its allies have stressed that Iran and its supposedly moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, have to show concrete evidence that they are not trying to build nuclear weapons before they will ease crippling sanctions.

Iran insists it only wants reactors for energy and medical use.

Mr Salehi also noted that Iran has upgraded its protective measures against cyberattacks that have 'continued' over the past years.

Iran periodically announces the arrest of suspects charged with espionage or attempts to sabotage its nuclear facilities, only to go quiet on their identity or fate.

Israel claims the Belgian-Iranian it has arrested – Ali Mansouri - took notes on the security screenings at Israel’s international airport and photographed the US Embassy in Tel Aviv and a separate classified security installation.
