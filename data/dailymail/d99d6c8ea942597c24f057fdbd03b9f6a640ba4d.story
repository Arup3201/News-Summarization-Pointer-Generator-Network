Alex Salmond may have acted illegally by denying expat Scots the right to vote in the independence referendum, a top lawyer has claimed.

Aidan O’Neill, an expert in European law, said the rules imposed by Scotland’s first minister had ‘good prospects’ of being overturned in court.

He believes the decision could be reversed in a judicial review on the grounds that it violated the right of Scottish expatriates to enjoy freedom of movement under EU law.

This would add an estimated 1.15million Scottish expats to the voting rolls and court action could delay the referendum, which is due to take place on September 18.

Legal challenge: Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond (pictured with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon) has denied expatriates the right to vote - but this might be illegal

That figure includes some 750,000 who are currently living in England.

Dumfries-born lawyer James Wallace, who is now based in London, asked Mr O'Neill for his legal advice on the matter.

If unsuccessful, Mr O'Neill says a petition demanding a judicial review can be lodged within a week and fast-tracked to the Supreme Court for a judgement before this September's planned referendum.

More than 2,700 signatures backing a legal challenge have already been collected.

The campaign for Scottish home rule began almost as soon as unification took place in 1707

1934: The Scottish National Party was established

1998: The Scotland Act paved the way for devolution

2007: SNP won their first minority government

2011: SNP election victory leads to securing a mandate for a referendum

2014: A referendum on Scottish independence has been earmarked for September 18

Among those supporting the action are former Scottish rugby union player Kenny
 Logan, husband of presenter Gabby Logan and Alex McLeish, a former 
football manager for Scotland. Both now live in England.

A judicial review could however cost as much as £100,000, so donors are being sought who are willing to support the action.

In contrast to the expatriates who are currently denied the vote, many Commonwealth, Irish and EU citizens living in Scotland - whose citizenship would remain unaffected whatever the outcome of the referendum - are allowed to vote.

Mr O'Neill told the The Sunday Times that other points to consider are that while Scottish-born British citizens have been promised Scottish citizenship if the referendum favours independence - they may in turn lose their British citizenship.

An independent Scotland might also need to apply for EU citizenship, meaning expatriates would for a period of time lose their rights to free healthcare, benefits and the right to work in EU countries.
