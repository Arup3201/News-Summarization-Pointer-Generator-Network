Everton have received a boost in their hopes of re-signing Gerard Deulofeu as the attacking midfielder has failed to settle in at Sevilla.

Deulofeu, who impressed Roberto Martinez during his season-long stay at Goodison Park, is yet to win over Sevilla boss Unai Emery.

Emery has refused to play the on-loan Spaniard until he changes his attitude and improves on his performances at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan.

Barcelona could subsequently end Deulofeu's stay at Sevilla before loaning him back out to another side if they feel the 20-year-old is not benefiting from his spell away from the Nou Camp.

The experienced La Liga boss, speaking to talkSPORT, said: 'Regardless of the contract, I only select my top XI. If for now he's playing a little less, it does not mean that next month he will play more.

'The club does not obligate me to do anything, all players are equal. His selection will come with the process of improvement. I hope he does, because it is a challenge we have set.

'We want him to improve his overall game - his team play and defensive actions.'

Deulofeu scored three goals in 25 Premier League games  before returning to Spain at the end of last season.
