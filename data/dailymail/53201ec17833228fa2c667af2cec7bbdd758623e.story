On the face of it, Princess Eugenie doesn’t have much in common with a US pop star renowned for her lewd behaviour on stage.

But Eugenie and Miley Cyrus are united in one respect – they both seem to have perfected the rather crude dance known as ‘twerking’.

The 23-year-old princess, seventh in line to the throne, has been pictured in a pose almost identical to the provocative moves Miss Cyrus controversially performed with singer Robin Thicke at a show in New York last month.

Beauty and the beast: Princess Eugenie and a stuffed bear strike a similar pose to Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke at the MTV awards - as her friend Harry Wentworth-Stanley wags a disapproving finger

It was almost identical to the extravagant moves which singer Miley Cyrus famously performs

Eugenie appears to have adopted the dance’s posture – bending forward while moving her hips – in front of a stuffed bear.

The
 picture is believed to have been taken in a bar in the Swiss ski resort
 Verbier where Eugenie was on a family holiday in February.

The
 image, which has just emerged, was uploaded to Instagram in March by 
her friend Harry Wentworth-Stanley who appears alongside her.

Former Disney star Miss Cyrus, 20, was at it again on Saturday when she gave a raunchy performance at a  festival in Las Vegas.

The grainy image, showing 23-year-old Eugenie in knee-length burgundy dress, black stockings and a Tory-style blue rosette was posted in March.

The break made headlines as the Yorks were joined by Prince Harry and his girlfriend Cressida Bonas, 24 – and the young couple were seen hugging and kissing in public for the first time.

The photograph is publicly available  on the unrestricted Instagram profile of Mr Wentworth-Stanley – the 23-year-old son of the Queen’s cousin, the Marquess of Milford Haven.

At the same time, he posted six other pictures on the website – which boasts 150 million members worldwide – showing him and a group of friends enjoying the bars and restaurants of the Swiss resort.

Twerking: Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke demonstrate the dance craze at the MTV awards

It is unclear whether the Princess was actually twerking in the photograph, but she adopted the dance’s distinctive posture, which requires bending forward while moving the hips . 

Just days after 20-year-old Cyrus – daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus – performed the  hip-hop inspired dance at the MTV Video Music Awards last month with fellow singer Robin Thicke, the word ‘twerking; found its way into the online version of the Oxford English Dictionary.

Princess Eugenie’s Verbier holiday came only months after she graduated from Newcastle University with a degree in art history, English literature and politics.

She is now preparing to move to New York, where she will begin working at a trendy auction house called  Paddle8 –  run by Alexander Gilkes, 34, who went to Eton with Princes William and Harry.

Beatrice, meanwhile, has just finished a year working for the Cabot Square Capital finance house in  London.

This is the second time in a week that a potentially embarrassing photograph has surfaced on Instagram after David Cameron was pictured snoozing on a bed, with his Ministerial Red Box lying next to him.

The photograph was taken before the wedding of his sister-in-law, Alice Sheffield, and posted by her sister Emily.

The bride-to-be was at the front of the picture, as a barefoot Mr Cameron slept behind her on the wood-framed four-poster bed. The picture has since been removed.
