An artist has turned run-down building walls into delicious masterpieces with the novel use of cake icing.

Montreal-based Shelley Miller creates intricate murals and street art installations with the colorful, sugary confection, taking her inspiration from calligraphy designs and temple inscriptions.

While some of the murals are more permanent pieces erected for exhibitions, those on the streets are temporary, cracking and melting within just a few days.

Elaborate: Constructed on a brick wall, one of her installations called Sugar Bomb (pictured) consisted of piped icing sugar in swirling shapes and vibrant colors. It was on display in Saskatchewan in July 2013

Through her art, she aims to show how all forms of decoration - from graffiti and calligraphy to temple inscriptions, architecture and even cake decoration - all 'borrow from the same visual language'.

One of her projects called Sugar Bomb was located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, a Canadian province, and was on display in July 2013.

Constructed on a brick wall, the installation consisted of piped icing sugar in swirling shapes and vibrant colors.

According to the artist's website, the piece was intended to create a contrast between the very elaborate design and the dilapidated wall.

Historical reference: Another one of her works, Cargo, depicted sugar's role in colonialism and the slave trade

Political commentary: Displayed in Montreal in 2009, this 'public billboard initiative' showed the history of sugar, with an image of the port of Montreal made out of edible blue paint on white sugar tiles

'Sugar Bomb is an excessively ornate 
"feminine" piece of graffiti in a domain that has historically been 
dominated by men and seen as a masculine assertion of self in the public
 sphere,' it reads.

Another one of her works, which was significantly more traditional in its style, was called Cargo and was a reference to sugar's role in colonialism and the slave trade.

Displayed in Montreal in 2009, this 'public billboard initiative' depicted the history of sugar, with an image of the port of Montreal in white and blue.

To create this piece, Ms Miller painted the scene in edible blue paint onto white sugar tiles, referencing a Spanish and Portuguese ceramic tile tradition called azulejo.

Decorative arts: A piece called Signature (pictured) consisted of 'graffiti tags' which, upon closer inspection, were inspired by arabesque scrolls and calligraphy from ancient mosques

The tiles were then stuck onto the wall 
using cake icing, and visitors to the installation were invited to watch
 it crack and fade over time.

Ms Miller first became drawn to sugar as an artistic medium as a means of exploring the temporal nature of art in relation to time and the elements.

Indeed, while some of her installations last for months, others wash away with the rain the very day after being created.

Oceans and ships play a role in several of Ms Miller's works, including Stained - an installation in Waddington Alley, Victoria, constructed in 2011.

Situated in the historic area of the 
city, this blue and white mural depicted yet another colonial scene 
within a sugary frame, outlined with an ornately decorated design.

Two ships feature in the piece, and two dark figures below the scene are pictured harvesting sugarcane.

Some of the less political works created by Ms Miller include Pipe Dreams, an elaborate and colorful array of confectionery roses and swirls painted onto the side of a brick building in Quebec.

According to her website, the design is 'an attempt to monumentalize the domestic and bring the traditionally female practice of cake decorating into the realm of architecture and the public domain.'

Large proportions: Pipe Dreams, which was created in 2001, was inspired by various architecture techniques like fresco and cave painting, as well as home decorative practices and decoration

'This work is about the illusion of grandeur and decadence,' she writes. 'A lifestyle we strive for, but can only simulate.'

Ms Miller, who shares her works on Twitter and Facebook, has also made her ephemeral street art in Brazil, Australia and India, using just a common pastry bag to apply the icing to various surfaces.
