For traffic policeman Tony Lepore, going on the beat is more than just a job... he takes the term quite literally.

The twinkle-toed officer has become a crossroad sensation in Providence, Rhode Island, after turning his daily car management duties into a highly-choreographed dance routine.

He spins on his heels, drops to his knees, falls back on his hands and springs back upright, all while blowing his whistle rhythmically as he points his white-gloved fingers frantically from side to side.

On the beat: Tony Lepore has become a crossroad sensation after turning his daily car management duties into a highly-choreographed dance routine

Mr Lepore has been entertaining motorists since 1984 when he came up with the moves to alleviate boredom after he was transferred from night shifts foiling crime to traffic duties.

At the age of 65 he is now retired, but has become such a hit in the town that the mayor invites him back to the same busy intersection every Christmas to bring a extra holiday cheer to commuters.

He says he was inspired by a prank shown on TV classic Candid Camera, and decided to add his own fancy footwork, gyrating and flamboyant arm movements to his traffic direction.

Speaking in 2009, he said: 'I saw Candid Camera and I thought, "Gee, maybe tomorrow I'm going to try a couple of spins and hand movements"... But I didn't know if my bosses were going to like it.'

Cop a load of this: Mr Lepore is now retired but his act had become so popular that he was invited by the mayor to reprise his act specially for the Christmas season

Feel the rhythm: He keeps the beat by blowing on his whistle rhythmically as he points his white-gloved fingers frantically from side to side

Hero: The Vietnam veteran has had his share of serious police work, spending nine years on night duty in Providence and being decorated for valour in the line of duty

However, amused motorists loved him so much, police chiefs allowed him to carry on.

The Vietnam War veteran has had his share of serious police work, spending nine years on night duty in Providence. He has even been twice decorated with the coveted Medal of Valor for bravery in the line of duty.

He once saved two teenage girls by diving into the freezing river after their car overturned into the water. On another occasion he pulled workers from the rubble of a building levelled by an explosion - just in time to save them from a second blast.

Popular: He began the routine in 1984 and motorists liked it so much police chiefs allowed him to carry on

But a transfer to day duty and directing traffic left him bored, he says.

Three years after inventing his trademark dance routine, Mr Lepore retired and went into catering with his brother, but the mayor of Providence asked him back in 1992 after a local newspaper interviewed him for a 'Whatever happened to' feature - and he is still doing it now.

Indeed, he even offers himself as a 'Tony-a-gram' for birthdays, graduations and office parties in which he will perform his famous 'traffic hop' for guests.

He also performs at schools across America with lessons on 'School Bus Safety, Stranger Danger, Halloween Safety, Street Crossing Safety', according to his website.
