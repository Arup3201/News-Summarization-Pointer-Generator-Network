Michael Phelps still can't bring himself to utter the word 'comeback.'

Yet all signs point to the world's greatest swimmer returning to the pool for the 2016 Rio Olympics.

In the strongest signal yet that his retirement won't last much longer, Phelps has rejoined the U.S. drug testing program — a necessary step for any athlete hoping to compete in an Olympic sport.

Return? One of the most successful Olympians ever could be ready to come out of retirement

'I have no idea what's going to 
happen,' Phelps told The Associated Press in an exclusive telephone 
interview from Minneapolis, where he was attending an Arena Grand Prix 
meet and even got in some impromptu training in the diving well. 'If I 
really do start getting excited and wanting to do it, I can make that 
choice. If not, at least it's something we can say we prepared for.'

Phelps
said he's merely giving himself the option of competing again and 
stressed that 'nothing is set in stone.' But the doping program is a 
major inconvenience, requiring him to be available for random testing 
and keep officials apprised of his whereabouts.

'It is a challenging thing to do,' he said. 'We are covering all the bases just in case.'

Phelps
has won the most and is indeed the most decorated athlete in Olympic 
history. He captured 18 gold medals and 22 medals overall at the last 
three Summer Games, shattering the previous marks. He is best known for 
breaking Mark Spitz's record for a single Olympics by winning eight gold
medals at Beijing in 2008.

The
U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said Phelps was among the athletes who 
underwent doping tests in the third quarter, the period ending Sept. 30.
He was tested twice.

His 
longtime coach and close friend, Bob Bowman, said Phelps actually 
re-entered the doping program near the end of the second quarter, but he
wasn't tested and therefore wasn't listed in that USADA report. He 
would be eligible to compete again in March, according to Bowman.

'I
just think he's in a place where he's feeling good about swimming,' 
Bowman said. 'If he chooses to compete, he's got some time. I like 
having the ability to do it. To be perfectly honest, he's not anywhere 
near being able to compete in a meet or anything like that. We're just 
getting started on improving his fitness. We'll see where that goes.'

Phelps
has been training with Bowman's team at the North Baltimore Aquatic 
Club. Each week, he's been working a couple of days in the pool, a 
couple of days in the weight room, and one or two days on his core 
training. He has lost about 15 pounds and is back in the low 190s, not 
far off his competition weight.

'If
I decide to keep going and swim again, then I'll compete,' he said. 'If
I don't,' he added, letting out a big laugh, 'I guess I'll re-retire. 
Just don't compare me to Brett Favre.'

A possible 
comeback by the 22-time Olympic medallist has been mooted for a good 
year with fellow American Ryan Lochte vocal for some time that his 
friend and rival would return to the pool.

That would appear now to be the case with the Baltimore swimmer having already undergone two doping tests.

By
subjecting himself to drug testing, the 28-year-old Phelps has given 
himself plenty of time to go through an entire season before the next 
major meet, the 2015 world championships in Russia, an important 
steppingstone to the Rio Games the following summer. FINA, the world 
governing body for swimming, requires an athlete to be tested for at 
least nine months before taking part in sanctioned events.

USADA said Phelps was among the athletes who underwent doping tests in the period ending September 30.

It means the 28-year-old will be eligible to compete in the trials for the World Championships in Kazan in 2015.

'There's no grand scheme,' Bowman said. 'It just sort of makes sense that he can make some choices if he wants to.'

Phelps
attended the world championships in Barcelona this past summer, but he 
seemed even more pumped about being on hand for one of the more mundane 
events that fall between the Olympic years.

'Just
being around this is exciting for me,' he said from Minneapolis. 'It 
really has been a part of my life ever since I was a kid.'

Phelps' return would surely be welcomed by the entire sport and even those who only follow swimming during the Olympics.

'I
think it would be great for the sport,' said Conor Dwyer, a relay gold 
medalist at the London Games who trains with Phelps at North Baltimore. 
'He elevated it so much before that I think it can only get bigger with 
him in it. Obviously he's the greatest swimmer of all time — doubled 
everyone's medal counts — so to have him on your relay only helps the 
USA win more golds.'

At the World Championships in 
Barcelona last summer when asked of a comeback, Phelps said: 'If anybody
would know about me coming back it would be myself and I haven't said 
one thing to anybody about anything.

'But I am here watching it, enjoying myself.

'I enjoying playing golf, I enjoy getting up at noon- it's a good life.'

While apparently exasperated by such questions, it seems Phelps was already looking ahead.

A possible rematch with Chad Le Clos 
is intriguing, the South African who had pictures of Phelps on his wall 
as a child before taking his 200 metres butterfly crown in London.

Possibly this is one of Phelps' motivations.

Phelps'
appeal goes far beyond the pool deck. His recognition factor has often 
matched athletes from far more prominent sports, such as NBA star LeBron
James, a truly impressive accomplishment for a swimmer.

Phelps
retired after winning six more medals at last summer's London Olympics,
adamant that all his goals were met and he had no desire to still be 
swimming in his 30s. He will be 31 by the time of the opening ceremony 
for the Rio Games — not that old, really, for today's elite swimmers. 
One of his top rivals, Ryan Lochte, is a year older and has every 
intention of competing through the next Olympics.

If
there is a comeback, Phelps wouldn't be doing it for the money, having 
earned tens of millions of dollars in endorsements during his career. He
remains a marketable name, even in retirement, though his endorsement 
potential certainly goes up if he's in the water.

More
likely, this is another case of an athlete who simply missed the thrill
of competition and is still young enough to do something about it, 
assuming he can find the motivation to endure Bowman's grueling regimen 
for nearly three more years.

'There
are a lot of things that really excite me ... that get me motivated,' 
Phelps said. 'But I swam for 20 years. That's something that's going to 
be very, very hard to top.'
