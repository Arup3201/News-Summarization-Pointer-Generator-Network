Just shy: England captain Eoin Morgan's former mentor says the Irishman's decision not to sing the anthem is not political

England's Irish cricket captain Eoin Morgan does not sing the national anthem before matches as he is 'very shy', not because of politics, his former mentor says.

The Dublin-born batsman, who switched from the Irish to the English side in 2009 and was made captain late last year, has stayed quiet as God Save The Queen has boomed out at the Cricket World Cup.

While some have suggested his silence is because he is from Ireland, those close to the skipper say he is simply too shy to sing on camera.

Asked why he has not been belting out the anthem before the Test matches in Australia and New Zealand this month, Morgan said it was 'a long story' and 'a personal thing'.

Adding that he would not sing the Irish anthem either, he said at a press conference: 'It's pretty simple. I have never sung the national anthem when playing for Ireland or England. It does not make me any less proud to be an English cricketer.

'I am extremely proud to be in the position that I am in and privileged to be captain of the World Cup side.'

Morgan's former deputy headmaster Kevin Jennings, who gave the cricketer a scholarship when he was 11 years old, told the Daily Telegraph that his decision not to sing was not political. 

He said: 'He’s a very shy fellow. I would imagine he’d be quite self-conscious singing in that context. I would say it’s as simple as that. He certainly wasn’t in the school choir.

'I’ve known him since he was 11 and he was always very quiet and reserved. Where he was confident was going out to bat.

'I know people could read something into it, but I don’t think it’s political. He certainly isn’t political to my knowledge.'

Mr Jennings, now retired, added that Morgan is 'well-mannered and polite but never an extroverted fellow. He wouldn’t overdo the chat. When I see him do these press conferences now I think, he couldn’t have done that seven or eight years ago. He must be coached for that.'

Morgan's silence has divided opinion on Twitter, with some saying that the England captain should sing the national anthem.

The England cricket team represents England and Wales and rules state that only British and Irish players can be picked.

These British and Irishmen must be born in England or Wales, however they can qualify by residency, as Morgan did by living in Middlesex for four years.

However during those years he was still allowed to play for Ireland, as they do not play full Test cricket like England do. 

Morgan was the third Irishman to switch allegiance, after Ed Joyce and Boyd Rankin. 

Until 1992, the England team also represented Scotland.

Piers Morgan wrote: 'If you want to captain England, then sing the damn national anthem too.'

But Gary Lineker defended the cricketer, saying: 'Not everyone is comfortable singing. Some do, some don't. Doesn't alter performance. 

'I used to hate singing it. Still do. Mainly because I'm hideously bad. Don't understand why it's important.'

England rugby mascot Harry Westlake was described as a 'legend' by full-back Mike Brown for belting out the anthem before the Six Nations match against Italy a fortnight ago.

Six-year-old Harry could be seen singing with all of his heart before the match at Twickenham and his performance went viral on Twitter.

Before the football World Cup in Brazil last summer, England Roy Hodgson demanded that his players sing the national anthem with pride. 

He said at the time: 'You very rarely play against opponents and they haven't got their hands on their hearts and singing their anthem as loud as they can.

'We are proud to be England players and, in my case, England manager, so when the national anthem comes up it's an obvious one for me that we sing it.'
