Between them, they could do some damage in their prime and look like they still could as Arnold Schwarzenegger posed with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and UFC queen Ronda Rousey.

Arnie - a seven-time Mr Olympia, three-time Mr Universe and ex-governor of California - was at Wrestlemania when he got a photograph with the pair and uploaded it to Instagram.

The Rock and Rousey even got involved in the action, taking to the ring with Triple H as the undefeated women's bantamweight champion lifted the wrestler and threw him over her shoulder.

Schwarzenegger wrote with the snap: 'Great to see you two tonight at Wrestlemania. The Rock, you're looking lean and mean, my friend. Ronda Rousey, you look ready to win another three championships in a row.'

Despite getting involved, Rousey is unlikely to swap UFC for WWE as her appearance was part of a recent media tour in the United States. 

She featured on Jimmy Fallon last week, and demonstrated her ability to make opponents tap using her trademark armbar on the talk show host. 

'They call you the arm collector because you almost snap people's arms in half when you're fighting,' Fallon said. 'If they don't say the right word, their arm is getting broken.' 

Like Fallon, Triple H almost found that out too by the looks of things.
