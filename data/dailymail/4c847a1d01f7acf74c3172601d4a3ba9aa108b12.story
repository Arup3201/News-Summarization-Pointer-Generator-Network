Fiona believes that by confronting the issue of pregorexia, Emmerdale could help many expectant mothers

Emmerdale's ongoing 'pregorexia' storyline may be the first time the dangerous condition has ever featured in a British soap.

But for the many thousands of women around the country carrying babies while in the grip of anorexia and bulimia, it's a constant battle that can lead to severe complications and dangerously undernourished babies.

Actress Fiona Wade, whose character Priya Sharma is currently going through the eating disorder one in 14 pregnant women suffers from, is glad she's raising awareness of what is essentially a mental disorder.

'Pregorexia is a dangerous condition,' says the 35-year-old, 'yet most people have never heard of it. I don't think it's taken as seriously as many other mental illnesses - but that's what it is.

'When you think how many people watch the show we're really getting the message out there. I've had lots of lovely letters from people with the condition saying they feel they can be more open about it now it's out there. It's wonderful to think the storyline might be making a positive difference to viewers' lives. I just wanted to portray it as accurately as I could.'

Fiona researched the condition in detail, speaking to psychotherapists and reading sufferers' accounts.

And what she uncovered shocked her - a study by University College London found seven per cent of pregnant British women have a full-blown eating disorder, while a quarter are highly concerned about their weight, placing their life, and that of their unborn child, at risk.

Fiona's research has helped her realistic portrayal of Priya, who's seven months pregnant and obsessed with avoiding food and making herself sick after meals. 'I threw myself into it to help me get into sufferers' mindsets. It's been challenging, with lots of scenes that take it out of you. But I feel passionate about it.'

While Fiona, nominated for Sexiest Female at next month's British Soap Awards, has always been slim, thankfully she's never suffered an eating disorder herself.

Though that doesn't mean the actress, who has previously stripped down to her underwear for racy photoshoots and sex scenes, is without self-doubt.

'Oh, I'm as insecure as every other girl,' she says. 'I'm the biggest worrier. I'll do a shoot and think, “Oh God, was that alright?” I pull myself apart the same as anyone.'

Aside from that, Fiona, who's just signed on with the ITV soap for another year, says she's having the time of her life. The only thing missing, though, is a man to share it with.

'I'm in my 30s and, while being single is fun, it would be nice to meet someone. I'm in a great place career-wise, so that would be the icing on the cake. Priya likes a bad boy, but I definitely don't want one - I'm ready to meet a great guy who'll be my best friend.

'Yes, I'm super busy, constantly running between my home in Leeds and my mum's place in Hertfordshire, but if you want to be with someone enough you'll make it work. I wouldn't let anything stand in the way.'

Dubai or Las Vegas? Dubai is perfect for winter sun and relaxation.

Juice or cola? I don't drink alcohol so I'm obsessed with fresh juices -  I try to have one every morning.

Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio? Leonardo is incredible - every film, every character he plays, he nails.

Kylie Minogue or Rihanna? I like all kinds of music, but I've been loving Kylie's new album Kiss Me Once lately.

Monopoly or Cranium? My family all play Cranium at Christmas - it gets everyone thinking and is such fun.

4x4 or a sports car? I really like the Range Rover Evoque - it's a 4x4 with a sleek look for women.Winding down with friends or a spa weekend? I love a catch-up  at mine with a movie and food.
