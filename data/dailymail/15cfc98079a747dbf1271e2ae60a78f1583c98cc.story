An eight-year-old boy with cerebral palsy has taken his first steps just days after pioneering surgery in America.

Callum Brown flew to St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri from his home in Seaton Sluice, Northumberland, for selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to improve the muscle tone in his lower legs.

Cerebral palsy - an umbrella term used to describe damage to the brain that occurs around birth and affects the ability to move. About 1,800 children are diagnosed with it each year in the UK.

Callum Brown, with father Neil and mother Sharon, flew to St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri for selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to improve the muscle tone in his lower legs

The procedure involves severing the nerves in the spine that send messages to paralyse the leg muscles

The procedure involves severing the nerves in the spine that send messages to paralyse the leg muscles. With the tensed muscles free to resume normal movement, the patient is then able to walk.

After over five hours on the operating table and gruelling physiopherapy, Callum stunned his parents Sharon and Neil by taking his first supported steps just four days after the operation.

The huge development came after primary school pupil Callum felt some pain following the surgery.

But now he is recovering and is determined to work hard with his physiotherapist to keep progressing.

His parents, Sharon and Neil Brown, spent two years raising more than £50,000 to
pay for the surgery in America which they hope will enable him to walk 
unaided.

Mrs Brown, 40, said she was delighted at Callum's first steps. She said: 'We are so proud of him, he has done fantastically well. We never thought that four days post-op he would want to try and walk and push himself so much. 

'I can see the pain in his face but also the determination. He deserves the world after what he has been through in such a short period of time, double hip surgery and this.

'We asked him if he wanted to stand and he said OK. 

'Me and the physio stood him up and counted to 10, us supporting his arms, and he did this several times, then to our amazement he said: "Can I walk?".

Callum's parents spent two years raising more than £50,000 to pay for the surgery in America which they hope will enable him to walk unaided

'We both supported him, and he took 10 steps twice which was fantastic, although we had his arms he was still moving his legs himself. 

'He had another session and he did a little sitting on the edge of the bed again to work on his balance, then it was up to standing again. 

'He was tired and cried a little, saying his back was really hurting, but he decided he would get on with it and let us put him on his waking frame, and he managed to walk on that 10 steps again, three times.'

Callum, who suffers from diplegic cerebral palsy, jetted off to America with his parents for the surgery by world-renowned surgeon Dr TS Park.

He has since been discharged and will spend the next few weeks having vital physiotherapy.

On February 12, Callum will undergo a second operation on his hamstrings to improve his mobility

On February 12, Callum will undergo a second operation on his hamstrings to ensure he has a speedy recovery. 

Callum and his parents will return home at the end of February and Callum will continue with private physiotherapy. 

But the fundraising must continue when they return, to help fund his recovery and another trip to see Dr Park.

Selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs.

The
lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the 
neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve
fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the 
body.

Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves.

This
process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting 
the spastic muscles and which may not be 'transmitting' properly are 
identified and cut.

Due
to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise 
procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a
general anaesthetic.

Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.
