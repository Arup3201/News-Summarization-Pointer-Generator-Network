The revamp has involved opening up new rooms including a war time bunker fitted out with camp beds and conveniently situated near the wine cellar and a 1930s map room that had been lost under layers of paint and wallpaper.

At the time the couple lived there, Eltham Palace was the 'grand designs project of its day', saving the great hall of the medieval palace that had been the childhood home of Henry VIII and creating a glamorous property with all mod cons. 

The English Heritage team trawled through the guest book to find the explorers, film producers and socialites who most frequently visited the party house, and have produced personalised invitations that allow visitors to step into their shoes.

A new interactive visitor guide aims to bring the property to life, with film recreating how a swinging 1930s cocktail party would have looked in the party palace, along with expert views on the restoration of the medieval great hall, stories of the house and games.

There is also a children's tour, which explores the animals that lived there - including Mah Jongg, the Courtaulds' pet lemur who had his own heated bedroom, accessed via a pole ladder which gave him the run of the house.

Work has also been undertaken to recreate the 1930s garden, which sits among the ruins of the medieval palace.

Andrew Hann, English Heritage property historian, said: 'Eltham Palace was the ultimate grand designs project of its day boasting state of the art mod cons including under-floor heating, multi-room sound systems and a centralised vacuum cleaner.

It has undergone a series of transformations over the years from a grand hall used by royals to a millionaire's party palace.

But the first record of a settlement at Eltham was in the Domesday survey of 1086 which said the manor belonged to Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror.

It changed hands a number of times until 1295 when Anthony Bek, Bishop of Durham, acquired it and rebuilt the manor house before presenting it to the future Edward II in 1305. The King then passed it on to his queen Isabella.  

Successive monarchs lavished large sums on the palace. In the 1380s Richard II created a walled garden to the south beyond the moat while Henry IV  spent 10 of his 13 Christmases as king at Eltham.

It was a favoured residence of Edward IV who built its great hall and from the 14th to the 16th century it was an important royal palace, often used by monarchs who stayed there for hunting trips in the surrounding parks, according to English Heritage. 

Henry VIII passed much of his boyhood at Eltham, English Heritage says, and was the last monarch to spend large amounts of money on it. It was at Eltham in 1515 when Cardinal Wolsey took the oath of office of lord chancellor

In the decades that followed, it was poorly maintained and Elizabeth I and the early Stuarts only visited rarely. 

Over the following two centuries it was used as a farm and a substantial villa was built in the early 19th century.

At one point the great hall was being shored up with props and was being used as a barn even in 1903.

In 1933 millionaires Stephen and Virginia Courtauld took up a 99 year lease from the Crown.

They set about building a stylish house that incorporated the great hall which English Heritage calls 'a masterpiece of 20th-century design'.

The couple transformed the grounds, which are now a mix of 1930s design and medieval remains.

Keen horticulturalists, the Courtaulds also created a variety of garden features including a rock garden, formal rose gardens and a series of garden ‘rooms’, the latter being more typical of the Edwardian period or Arts and Crafts style.

According to English Heritage, the building provided enough space for entertaining a broad social circle which included Queen Mary, composer Igor Stravinsky, actress Gracie Fields, conductor Malcolm Sargent, film producers Basil Dean and Michael Balcon, band leader Lew Stone, and politicians including Rab Butler and Leo Amery.

'Our research has revealed a technologically advance, innovative home which will be brought to life for visitors through new multimedia handsets.

'From April visitors will be whisked back in time to the swinging 1930s when Stephen and Virginia Courtauld entertained the elite of society including composers, artists, politicians, key socialites and even Queen Mary.'

Cressida Diez-Finch, English Heritage interpretation manager, said the refurbishment aimed to give people a real sense of what the 1930s palace would have been like.

Before the makeover, 'it was beautiful, but it was very static, so you didn't get the sense of the people and fun and parties, which was really what it was about', she said.

'This is about bringing the whole place to life, re-imagining it and opening it up.'

Visitors will also get to see heritage conservation in action, as work continues to uncover restore a recently discovered map-room, whose maps of the world, the UK and London and themed wall paintings have been buried under many layers of paint and wallpaper.

English Heritage is appealing for the £35,000 needed for expert conservators to fully restore and protect the room, which gives a glimpse into a bygone age of luxury travel that saw the Courtaulds heading abroad for months each year, often on their yacht.
