Anyone entering a new tearoom in Weston-super-Mare might be forgiven for wondering if they've just exited a time machine and landed with a bump in war time Britain.

Well not quite but the quirky cafe, The Blitz Tearoom, does aim to take customers back 70 years to World War II.

From the music of Glen Miller and Vera Lynn to the decor and menu and even staff uniform - everything harks back to the Second World War.  

Ex army corporal, Michelle Austin, here posing with two manikins in traditional 1940s clothes, started the cafe to celebrate the spirit of the Blitz

Shelves are adorned with 1940's relics,  including antique tins originally containing dried milk, camp coffee and anti-gas ointment, along with Blitz-time radiograms and Bakelite phones

The walls are painted a mint green - a typical 1940's shade, while wartime relics include gas masks, home guard training manuals, along with ration book covered menus

The Blitz tearoom in Weston-super-Mare has been set up ex army corporal, Michelle Austin, 37, as a celebration of the era.

The single mother-of-three served in Germany before she left the army after nine years, in 2004, and started looking around for a fresh challenge.

She says: ‘I took a series of kitchen assistant jobs but grew bored so I went to college to train as a chef.  After that I worked in a tearoom but I decided I want to do something for myself and found a premises in the town.’

The former clothes shop was stripped back and took a year for the transformation to be complete.

‘It looked like a building site, and took a lot of hard work, but finally when I saw the results I was thrilled,’ says Michelle.

Shelves are adorned with 1940‘s relics, including antique tins originally containing dried milk, camp coffee and anti-gas ointment, along with Blitz-time radiograms and Bakelite phones.

Meanwhile Union Jack bunting, flags, and images of Lancaster Bombers and Spitfires are strewn across the walls.

The walls are lined with posters and messages reminiscent of the times including: 'Dig for Victory' and 'Make do and Mend'

The menu is a 1940's gastronomical experience which among other things include retro finger sandwiches of spam, egg and cress corned beef

The counter has a: ‘When in doubt, brew 
up’ War Department sign, and there are other  messages reminiscent of 
the times including: ‘Dig for Victory’ and ‘Make do and Mend.’

Mother-of-three Michelle says she is thrilled with the results of the makeover

A Welsh dresser is stacked with pretty vintage crockery while staff dress in authentic polka dot dresses, headscarves and floral aprons - typical of the fashion at that time.

The walls are painted a mint green - a fashionable 1940‘s shade, while wartime relics include gas masks, home guard training manuals, along with ration book covered menus.

The corridor leading out to the courtyard has been turned into Bethnal Green underground station -itself used as an air raid shelter during the war.  And in the tunnel the walls are covered with posters of the day.

The look is completed by two mannequins - of a woman and a child evacuee.

The menu is a 1940’s gastronomical experience too which among other things includes retro finger sandwiches of spam, egg and cress and corned beef. 

Drinks range from milk served in old fashioned small glass bottles, to ginger beer and Camp coffee.

Michelle says: ‘I’ve always been into retro stuff and the idea of the 1940‘s just came to me.

‘People like a bit of nostalgia, we can enjoy the glamour without the danger and I’m looking to set up World War two themed nights soon.’
