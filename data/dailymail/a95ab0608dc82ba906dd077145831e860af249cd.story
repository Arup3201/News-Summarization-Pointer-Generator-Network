The daughter of an Indiana woman who allegedly kidnapped a woman, locked her in a cage and repeatedly raped her has defended her mother.

'The whole story is not being told,' Maranda Higgs told NBC. 'It's not her, she's not a demon.'

Her mother, Kendra Tooley, 44, and Tooley's boyfriend, Ricky House, 37, allegedly offered the victim a ride as she walked home in July and took her to their trailer before knocking her out with chloroform.

The woman, a mother, was only saved when Tooley's ex-husband - Maranda Higgs' father - went to the trailer to lend them some money and saw the woman, who begged him to help her escape. 

Maranda Higgs said she felt awful for the victim and her family and feels 'torn in the middle'.

'I just want to wake up and have it be a dream,' she told NBC.

Tooley and House both pleaded not guilty to multiple charges on Monday and are being held in jail.

The woman, who is not being named because she is a victim of sexual assault, told authorities that she previously knew the couple because she had gone to school with House.

When they offered to give her a ride as she walked back from a party on July 9, she accepted but was taken back to their home, where they knocked her out.

As her family and friends frantically searched for her for two months, the couple allegedly forced her to sleep in a wooden cage and put a red dog collar and leash around her neck.

She was only allowed out to cook and clean for the couple, and was also restrained with bungee cords and zip ties and forced to have sex with them, court papers say.

The woman was only saved when Tooley's ex-husband, Ron Higgs, was invited over to the trailer last Thursday when the couple needed money.

Higgs said he was dumbfounded when House casually said to him: 'I've got a girl back here in a cage.'

'She had a t-shirt on, and that was it,' Higgs told WFIE. 'She had a leather belt, like a dog collar on. Every night, they locked her in there. No food, no water.'

Initially he thought the woman was in on the plan, but the following day, when he was still at the home, she told him she was being held there and pleaded with him to help her escape.

'That's when she told me on the second night with tears running down her eyes, "Please, do not leave here with out me," he said. 'And I promised her, "If I have to give my life to get you out of here I will".'

He managed to get the woman out of the trailer, allegedly with guns trained on him, and told the couple he would not call authorities - but after arriving back in Evansville, he called police.

'My hat's off to him,' Posey County Sheriff Greg Oeth told TSHP about Higgs.

'I'm glad he did what he did. I'm glad he was in the situation he was and I'm glad he was able to get her out of that residence and get her back to the safety of her family.'  

House was charged with four counts of rape, one count of conspiracy to commit rape, five counts of criminal confinement, two counts of kidnapping, one count of battery resulting in bodily injury and one count of pointing a firearm.

Tooley was charged with two counts of rape, one count of conspiracy to commit rape, four counts of criminal confinement, two counts of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy to commit criminal confinement. 

Both pleaded not guilty on Monday. They are due back in court on October 1.
