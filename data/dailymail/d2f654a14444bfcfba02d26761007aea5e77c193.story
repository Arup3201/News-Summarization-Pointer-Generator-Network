If you've ever wondered what it's like to reverse right into the heart of a storm, this shocking video  will give you a clue.

In footage captured on a camera mounted on the vehicle's dashboard, the clip shows an unnamed man unwittingly driving straight into a terrifying tornado, in Bashkiria, Russia.

As the driver reverses cautiously out of his garage, rain begins to fall hard on his windscreen.

But this is not just a spot of bad weather. As the vehicle makes its way onto the road, the wind picks up and the downpour becomes ferocious. 

The windscreen becomes totally obscured as water droplets become streams and debris flies towards it. 

Soon the wind is so fierce, it sweeps the car and its driver back towards the garage - which it rips to shreds in seconds.

Luckily for the driver, the twister appears to miss his car by a just few meters.

The footage also shows the aftermath and the trail of destruction left by the tornado: Roofs have fallen in, buildings collapsed and several windows of the Toyota RAV 4 have smashed, and the body of the car is severely dented. 

According to Viral Hog, which posted the video, the footage was filmed on August 29 this year.
