Reports that multi-millionairess Cheryl Fernandez-Versini nee Tweedy, formerly Cole is moving to Dalston to help her husband in the kitchen of his new restaurant are to be taken lightly – but to be honest, these days, it wouldn't exactly shock me if this actually happened.

Billionaire businesswoman and reality star Jessica Simpson, married just at the weekend to her unemployed baby daddy Eric, is already signing off on Instagram as Jessica Johnson. 

Beyonce, currently beleaguered with rumours of marriage woes, named her previous tour, not 'Girls Run the World' but 'the Mrs Carter Show'. 

Ashley says women like Cheryl, who have built up their own career, shouldn't have to drop it or take a backseat to please their man

Jennifer Aniston, massively famous in Friends at the time, legally became Mrs Pitt after her marriage to Brad, and sent out all personal correspondence for years on stylish 'Jennifer Pitt' stationery.

And whilst opinion formers now work overtime to reclaim the word 'feminism', there is a distinct trend going on right now - and it feels a little old school to me. Yes, it's about taking his name in public, but it's more than that.

There's a whole lot of deferring happening in Hollywood these days. Sometimes it feels like a return to the Fifties – making sure to always take into account your man's feelings and yes, his ego.

Not too long ago, Jennifer Aniston is rumoured to have moved the entire production of Life Of Crime from Detroit to NYC in order to be closer to fiancé Justin Theroux, who lived there.

Actress Jennifer Garner dutifully follows husband Ben Affleck from red carpet to red carpet supporting his career - actor Mark Ruffalo even recently implied he and Jen are no longer friends because Ben wasn't comfortable with it

Fashionista and actress Blake Lively skipped New York Fashion Week (forfeiting a mid-six figures in fees) for the first time ever, in order to visit her new husband Ryan Reynolds, then filming in Canada.

Actress Jennifer Garner dutifully follows hubby Ben Affleck from red carpet to red carpet supporting his career; and actor Mark Ruffalo recently implied he and Jen are no longer friends because hubby Ben wasn't comfortable with it.

After they began dating Jennifer Lopez immediately promoted former boyfriend and back up dancer Casper Smart to 'Tour/Choreographer Manager' bestowing a generous raise and including him at all major red carpet events. 

Ashley believes more women are taking a backseat to make their husbands feel like 'the man'

Kim Kardashian West recently told her multi-million dollar reality show mom-ager Kris, this about her career: 'Kanye comes first.' Indeed it seems that more and more famous women are taking a back seat in order to make their man feel like 'the man'.

Just like The Rules before them, books like The Proper Care And Feeding Of Husbands and The Surrendered Wife, can certainly provoke a hefty amount of eye rolling.

The underlying principle of course being that the control women wield at work and with children must be left at the front door of any happy marriage. 

With this in mind, as divorce rates remain high, and discontented marriages abound, some of the world's most famously strong and powerful women appear to be working overtime to put their men firmly out in front.

It is likely that Cheryl Cole will always be more famous than her handsome French husband – and likely, although it's continues to be widely reported he 'comes from a wealthy family' she will always have more money.

But by taking his name so publicly and immediately she's making a statement (as well as conveniently losing that last reminder of her errant ex), that she belongs to HIM. She's also said to have refused to sign a pre-nup and is already learning French.

Jumping in with both feet as she is, with a clear indication of her certainty and commitment, let's hope it's a promising sign for a marriage and a commitment based on just three months of togetherness.
