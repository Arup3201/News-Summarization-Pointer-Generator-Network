A teenage boy has died after he and a friend attempted to recreate a 'car-surfing' stunt they watched in movie 21 Jump Street.

Mohammad Khalid, 17, suffered serious head injuries after he fell from the roof of the car face down on to the concrete.

The teenager, from Sterling, Virginia, died three days later after being critically injured.

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum star as rookie cops in the 2012 remake of movie 21 Jump Street. The comedy has a number of over-the-top stunts including here where Hill's character attempts to roll over a speeding car 

The 17-year-old fell face first on to the concrete after sliding off the roof of the car. He died three days later 

Khalid and his 18-year-old friend, who has not been named, had been watching the movie, starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, along with other online clips last Tuesday. The teens then decided to try the dangerous move out for themselves.   

Marza Ramadan described the tragic accident to Fox: 'He was on the top, the car top, he didn't hold his body.

'And when he spinned, he fell down and hit his face from here to here by the front tire.'

The friends had been performing stunts with a car in a parking lot in Sterling, Virginia.

The Loudoun County Sheriff has yet to decide whether Khalid's teenage friend, who was behind the wheel at the time, will face charges. 

21 Jump Street was a 2012 comedy-action movie starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. The film, about two rookie cops trying to infiltrate a drug ring, took the same name as the Eighties TV series.
