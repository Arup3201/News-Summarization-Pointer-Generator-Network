Legendary AFL footballer and Australian Of The Year Adam Goodes has yet again found himself on the other end of a tirade of racial abuse.

The star centre half forward, with indigenous heritage, was labelled an 'ape', a 'hairy monkey' and a 'black dog' beneath a Facebook poll for AFL's most hated player, reports the Herald Sun.

The comments have since been removed, however a number of crude anti-Goodes remain on the 'Footy's Most Awkward Moments' Facebook page.

The page, which boasts more than 54,000 likes, posted the results of a poll on Monday in which users were asked to vote for the player they hate the most in the AFL. Goodes ranked second behind Richmond forward Jack Riewoldt.

'Goodes is a pompous self righteous t*****,' wrote one user.

Disgrace: Australian Of The Year Adam Goodes was subject to vile racist abuse on Facebook this week

'These sort of comments are appalling, shocking and a stark reminder that we still have work to do in this area,' Swans chief executive Andrew Ireland told News Corp Australia.

'Racism has no place in society. Not on the football field, not in the stands, not on social media and not anywhere else.

'The positive from the weekend was the willingness of crowds to stand up and not tolerate this sort of behaviour, regardless of their allegiances.'

According to the Herald Sun, fellow indigenous footballer Cyril Rioli took a number of screen grabs of the comments and posted them to his Twitter account.

'Goodes is a hairy monkey and deserves his place on this list,' was one of the comments shared by the disgusted Hawthorn forward.

Sydney Swans veteran Adam Goodes earlier revealed his friendship with Eddie McGuire was over following the racial comments he made about the player last year.

The dual Brownlow Medalist broke his silence over McGuire's on-air gaffe when he suggested Goodes, 34, be part of the promotion of King Kong the musical.

It happened just days after one of the games most loyal servants was called an 'ape' by a 13-year-old girl during a match against Collingwood - the club McGuire is president of.

Adam Goodes revealed he no longer considers McGuire a friend while speaking at a corporate business breakfast in Sydney.

'I would have liked to have called Eddie a friend before that incident,’ he said at a Corporate Club Australia breakfast in Sydney on May 5.

'Very proud' Australian Of The Year Adam Goodes said his indigenous heritage is a very important part of his life.

'Burns me to the core' Eddie McGuire said he felt deeply upset about the comments he made about dual Brownlow Medalist Adam Goodes last year

At the time of the incident McGuire, 49, went public with an apology and said he would remain as Collingwood' President despite pressure for him to resign.

He said: 'It burns me to the core that I would be associated with vilifying.'

'Every part of my being is about equality.'

AFL boss Andrew Demetriou said McGuire's comments would be investigated, but his position at Collingwood remained in tact.

At the time Goodes singled the young fan out in the crowd, McGuire stood united with him in their bid to stamp out racial vilification in the game.

He reacted by stepping in to support Goodes and even shook his hand in the dressing room after the final siren went.

But all his good work was undone when the Triple M radio presenter made a terrible error in judgement by suggesting Adam Goodes be flown down from Sydney to Melbourne to help promote King Kong the musical.

According to Fairfax Media reports, Goodes said he would still be prepared to shake McGuire's hand, but would not regard the gesture as an act of friendship.

'To have a friend and someone there that night who shook my hand in the dressing room afterwards, to have him say what he did was disappointing and uncomfortable but that’s how friendships end.'

Goodes also said he did not regret singling out the young girl who had vilified him.

'It was just a natural part of what I would do on a footy field,' he said.

'It was part of me acting instinctively.'

Legend: Despite the hurdles, Goodes is one of the greatest Aussie Rules players of all time and has two Brownlow medals and two premierships to his name

At 34, Goodes has played more than 300 AFL matches for Sydney and was twice named the best player of the year.

He was crowned the Brownlow Medalist in 2003 and 2006 and was this year given the country's top honour when named Australian Of The Year.

On receiving his award he said he was a 'very proud indigenous man' who was keen to fight racism in Australia.

He said it was a different accolade altogether to the one's he was used to receiving in AFL.

'I’m a little bit overwhelmed, to be honest. It’s not like winning a premiership or winning a Brownlow medal for the skills that you show on the football field, it’s quite amazing.'
