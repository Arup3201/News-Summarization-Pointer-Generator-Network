'Snooping' powers have risen and include the power to gain entry to check for house plant pests

Public officials have around 1,400 separate powers to enter homes – including the right to inspect fridges and even pot plants.

The number of ‘snooping’ powers available to town halls and public bodies has risen despite Coalition pledges to rein them in.

Among those which remain are powers to enter a home ‘to see if pot plants have plant pests or do not have a plant passport’ under the Plant Health Order 2005.

Another power allows officials to check the energy ratings on refrigerators under the Energy Information Household Refrigerators and Freezers Regulations 2004.

Officials can also use the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 to see if a garden hedge is too high.

Government departments have been given until next year to identify which powers should be repealed. Even then it may take months or years for them to be scrapped.

The Tory manifesto included a commitment to cut back on ‘the intrusive powers  of entry into homes’.

Only 15 such laws  have so far been repealed, including the power to enter a home and search for and seize German enemy property dating back  to the 1950s, or to carry out checks on whether illegal hypnotism displays were  taking place.

Details of the snooping powers emerged as the Home Office published new rules designed to stop public officials abusing them.

The code of practice suggests 48 hours’ notice should be given before a property is raided if that is considered appropriate and that officials should ‘be considerate’ over the time of day homes are entered.

Breach of the code will not be a criminal offence. Civil liberties campaigners accused ministers of failing to tackle the issue.

Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘It beggars belief that even after six months of working on this issue, some departments still have no idea what powers of entry they are able to use.’

Lord Taylor, minister for criminal information, said: ‘Powers of entry will always be vital for the investigation of crime, but this new code of practice will ensure they are used proportionately and not abused.’
