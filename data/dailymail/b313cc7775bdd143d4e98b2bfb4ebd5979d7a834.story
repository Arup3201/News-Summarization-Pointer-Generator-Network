Ritesh Brahmbhatt: A crooked solicitor who smuggled drugs and mobile phones into two prisons in his hugely oversized shoes is facing years behind bars

A crooked solicitor who smuggled drugs and mobile phones into two prisons by hiding them in his oversized shoes is facing years behind bars.

Ritesh Brahmbhatt, 31, was caught out by sniffer dogs as he entered north London's Pentonville jail in size 12, wide-fitting shoes stuffed with contraband.

A search found that he was carrying three-inch packages containing skunk, 
the illegal stimulant 'meow meow' and even electronic scales in his slip-ons.

The lawyer was planning to pass the items to inmate David Sterling, 28, who was wearing a full-length Muslim robe.

Blackfriars Crown Court had heard how the black, metal-buckled slip-ons  three sizes too big for Brahmbhatt were purchased just days before in a branch of High and Mighty, which specialises in outsize menswear.

Brahmbhatt, who is currently 
suspended by the Solicitors' Regulation Authority, admitted two plots 
between March 1 and September 17, 2009.

He also admitted a further charge of 
conveying a mobile phone into Winchester prison while on bail for those 
offences, on February 2 this year.

Jurors heard evidence he had been 
planning another smuggling operation just five months after he was 
caught the first time, and returned to the same shop to put in an 
order for more massive shoes.

Prison officer Lucy McLaren noticed Brahmbhatt's suspiciously high 
number of legal visits to Sterling and arranged a surprise sniffer dog operation.

Ms McLaren said: 'He came up the 
stairs towards and looked shocked to see we were doing a search as they 
would normally be done out-of-hours.

'I told him we were going to be conducting a dog search on all visitors and there would be a slight delay.

'He went very pale and started to pat his jacket pockets as though he'd forgotten something.'

The handlers told the officer both 
dogs had given their signal that he 'had been near or was in possession 
of a controlled substance'.

She said that when she told Brahmbatt 
he was embarrassed:

She said: 'He asked me to close the door so that none of 
his colleagues could see that he was being held.

'Mr Brahmbhatt at first didn't want to remove his shoes,

'However eventually he took them off. There were two packages inside his shoes.

His right shoes held a clingfilm package containing a 
mobile phone, earphones and accessories, a pair of electronic scales and
a small quantity of mephedrone, commonly known as meow meow.

A second package containing 25g of skunk cannabis was found in his left shoe.

Officers also found 27g of skunk and 53g of cannabis in his trousers.

Prisoner Desmond Brown, 26, his girlfriend Danielle Porter, 24, and 26-year-old Calvin Chance were involved with the operation alongside Sterling and Brahmbhat.

Nearly £20,000 passed through bank accounts belonging to Brahmbhatt, Porter, and two others before the racket was smashed.

Rufuz D'Cruz, prosecuting, said: 'Ritesh Brahmbhatt entered into a crude criminal conspiracy to smuggle prohibited items into prison with his clients, Sterling and Brown, who at that time were serving prisoners, and Chance and Porter.

'Over that six month period in 2009, Brahmbhatt, Chance and Porter worked on the outside, covertly conveying into prison drugs, mobile phones and mobile phone parts, during the course of a series of visits to both Sterling and Brown.'

Brahmbhatt who worked for Holloway law firm Mordi and Co, had 'abused his position of trust' as a lawyer to use legal visits to bring in items in return for cash bungs.

Sterling and Brown, Bromley-by-Bow, east London, Porter, of, Barking, Essex, and Chance, Leytonstone, east London, all denied two charges of conspiracy to convey articles including drugs, mobile phones and components into prison and were unanimously convicted.

Brahmbhatt, of Ilford, admitted two conspiracies, each relating to drugs and phones, in to prison, and a further charge of conveying a mobile phone into Winchester prison.

They are all awaiting sentencing.
