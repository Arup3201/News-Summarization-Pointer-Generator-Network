Sativex, a mouth spray designed to alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, will be available on the NHS in Wales

A cannabis-based drug designed to alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis is to be made available on prescription in Wales, health officials have confirmed.

Sativex, an oral spray made from two chemical extracts from cannabis plants, has been approved for used by the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group.

Wales' Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he hoped the spray would help ease the suffering of those who have to live with the reality of MS.

The decision was welcomed by the Multiple Sclerosis Trust, which said it hoped the decision would prompt England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to follow suit.

Charity director Amy Bowen, said: 'We are extremely pleased that people with MS in Wales will finally have better access to Sativex.

'As a charity we have campaigned over a long period for Sativex to be widely available because of the significant impact that MS spasticity can have on daily activities.

'We just hope that this recommendation will now lead to Sativex being more easily accessible in the rest of the UK.'

Sativex is the first cannabis-based medicine to be licensed in the UK and contains delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)

Passing Sativex to someone else, unless that person is lawfully entitled to possess the drug, is a criminal offence.

A statement about the drug on the MS Trust's website says: 'As Sativex is derived from cannabis, there were initial concerns that it might cause drug dependence, be psychoactive or cause withdrawal symptoms.

'However, studies into long-term use of Sativex in people with MS showed that sudden discontinuation of treatment did not result in any significant withdrawal-like symptoms although some people reported temporary changes in their sleeping patterns, mood or appetite following discontinuation.

Sativex is based on two extracts from cannabis plants and is the first cannabis-based medicine to be licenced anywhere in the UK

'The lack of withdrawal symptoms suggests that dependence on the treatment is highly unlikely. In addition, Sativex did not affect cognition (thinking or memory) or induce any mental health problems at the doses used.'

Wales Health Minister Professor Drakeford said: 'Following the appraisal of Sativex by the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group, I am pleased to announce we will be making the medicine available on the Welsh NHS to those who need it. 

'I hope this decision will help ease the suffering of some of those who have to live with the reality of MS every day.'
