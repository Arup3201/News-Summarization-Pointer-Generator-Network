Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have thrown yet another young man  to his death from a building after accusing him of being gay.

Stomach-churning photographs show a large bloodthirsty crowd gathered at the foot of a multi-storey building in the group's de facto capital Raqqa to watch the murder of the young victim.

With the baying crowd clambering on to rooftops to get a better view of the savage scene, the blindfolded man is dragged to the roof of the tallest building in the neighbourhood by bearded militants, who use mobile phones to film him being barbarically thrown to his death.

The images were released by local activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, who work undercover in the ISIS stronghold to expose the terror group's atrocities. 

The photographs carry the distinctive yellow logo of ISIS' propaganda wing Al Hayat Media Centre, suggesting they come from an as-yet unreleased video of the savage murder.

The photographs shows a huge crowd gathering at the foot of a run-down building in the west of the city, which ISIS captured in early 2014 amid the ongoing chaos of the Syrian Civil War.

So many people are seen in the streets to watch the man being thrown to his death that vehicles are unable to pass, although it appears the militants have erected metal railings to keep the crowds in line, giving a chilling sense of order to the savagery.

The blindfolded victim - who is understood to be in his 20s - is seen being dragged to the top of the building by three black-masked militants while two armed but undisguised fighters stand at their side using mobile phones to film the gruesome murder.

The next image shows the man plunging to his death, falling face first from behind a white metal railing towards the ground several stories below.

The horrific murder is just the latest example of ISIS throwing men accused of being gay to their death. 

In December ISIS released their first images of the shocking punishment as part of a release that also showed men accused of rape being crucified and left for dead in the centre of Raqqa. 

Similar images emerged in January and early February of men being thrown from 'the highest point in the city' following accusations of homosexuality. In a horrific twist, both of these men somehow survived the fall but were then stoned to death by the crowds gathered below.

And just last week another young man was thrown off a roof and stoned to death after being accused of homosexuality. Following a trial in an Islamic State court, the man was taken to the roof of the building and thrown to his death in front a large crowd below.

The man was described as a 'child of Lot' and accused of committing acts of sodomy.

Lot is referred to in the Bible and the Qur'an, where it is claimed the people of Sodom and Gomorrah carried out sinful acts and were severely punished by God.

The Islamic State cherry picks sections of the Koran and misinterprets the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits, experts say.

It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate', ruled by its often brutal version of Islamic law.

The group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet's example.

But now Muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out, saying that the group hand picks what it wants from Islam's holy book, the Koran, and from accounts of Muhammad's actions and sayings, known as the Hadith.

An ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa in Syria waving an Islamic State flag and brandishing a gun. Experts have now said that ISIS misinterprets the Koran in order to wage jihad 

It then misinterprets many of these, while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections.

Writings by the group's clerics and its English-language online magazine, Dabiq, are full of citations from Koranic verses, the Hadith and centuries of interpreters, mostly from hardliners.

But Joas Wagemakers, an assistant professor of Islamic Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, says these are taken far out of context by ISIS.

He explained that Muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a 'decontextualised way' to suit their purposes and says that ISIS represent the extreme.

He added: 'It would be a mistake to conclude the Islamic State group's extremism is the true Islam that emerges from the Koran and Hadith.
