A horrified father has spoken out after he saw a video of his ex-girlfriend hitting his two-year-old daughter in footage shared online last week.

Charlie Foster III of Ballston Spa, New York said he burst into tears as he watched the upsetting video posted onto Facebook involving his daughter Shelby Foster.

'I immediately started crying,' he told WFLA. 'I felt like I needed to do something.'

The footage that was shared on  Monday shows his former girlfriend Darci Ives and her boyfriend Louis Yager, who live together in Tampa, chastising and hitting Yager's two children and Shelby.

From slapping the three preschool-aged children to shoving a dirty broom in one of their faces, Foster found it all hard to watch.

After seeing the scene of his daughter being slapped in the face by Ives, he contacted Florida's child abuse hotline and finally got through after three attempts, according to WFLA. He also contacted Tampa police.

Ives and Yager are currently under investigation by police for possible child abuse.

Ives' sister reportedly shot the disturbing footage and a friend made one compilation of the several videos that show the children with Ives and Yager.

During the video, Ives is seen shouting 'no, I don't want to fight with you, I gotta get Crystal to bed' before smacking and telling a child 'here's something to cry about'.

In another scene she is seen cleaning the kitchen floor before shoving a broom in the face of a crying child seated in a highchair.

It appears her sister who is allegedly filming is heard saying 'you shouldn't put that in her face'.

Yager is seen shouting 'be quiet right now' to one of the children before it appears he is hitting the baby seated in the highchair on the head while saying 'hello, be quiet'.

Earlier reports said on Monday the children were taken into custody by child protective services and were placed into shelter care.

'There is probable cause to shelter the children at this time,' said Hillsborough Circuit Judge Jack Espinosa Jr. at the time.

Ives and Yager, following the seizure of their children, said they hoped to get their children back.

Relatives and friends have said Ives and Yager met only a few months ago before she decided to move from New York and into a trailer park with him near Ybor City in Tampa.

Natosha Wilkins of Ballston Spa, New York was one of many people who shared the video in an effort to get justice served against Yager and Ives.

On Wednesday she wrote on Facebook expressing that she was happy the children are now safe.

Wilkins wrote: 'Even though the babies are safe, and under CPS care I'm still busting my ass off for them. & I won't stop til they have a loving home and the right proper care! You three beautiful babies deserve more then what you have gotten.'

In previous reports, the Hillsborough State Attorney's office did not press child abuse charges after the video surfaced, but said that authorities were reviewing new evidence that had surfaced on Monday. 

Foster, who is currently raising money to pay for legal and travel fees so that he can bring Shelby to New York, said he has not been able to reach his daughter since she was placed into shelter care.

'I would tell her that I love her. I would tell her that I miss her and I want her home,' Foster told WFLA. 'I just want her to know that daddy's fighting for her.'

Currently living with his fiancee, Foster said that Ives had been moving around to stop him from having contact with Shelby.

On his GoFundMe page he wrote that he would do anything to bring his daughter back home to 'live with her family who loves and cares for her'.

He wrote: 'The videos have gone viral with the help and support of all the caring people on Facebook and I can't thank you enough for helping her get out of her mother's custody.

'But I still need help paying for the expenses to travel to Florida and get her out of foster care. And to pay for an attorney to make sure her mother gets the maximum punishment.'

He added: 'If I can raise the money to get down there and [get] a great attorney, we will be one step closer to bringing Shelby back home with the family she deserves.'

On a Facebook page titled A Safe Haven For Shelby, it appears Foster posted a message on Thursday saying that people had been concerned about Yager's two children, Chris and Crystal, including himself.

Natosha Wilkins, who had posted the video earlier this week to get the attention of police and CPS, said she is happy the children are in the care of CPS but that the fight will not stop

On Thursday, a Facebook page called A Safe Haven for Shelby wrote that Yager's kids, Chris and Crystal, are in a better place as many are concerned for them

The post said that the children's mother is not in the picture and that they will also not be placed with her.

He wrote: 'I know everyone including myself is very concerned about Chris and Crystal. I know the kids and unfortunately the parents. 

'All I can say is Mom is not in the picture, nor will she have them placed with her. I can tell you from being on the good side of foster care that none including family members are ever told the whereabouts of the foster placement. 

'None of us can get information because we have no direct correlation to the case. Even if we did, limited information is given. 

'I am concerned and will continue to update if I get any info on these beautiful babies. Right now they are in a better place. 

'They do have family, they do have someone fighting to get them, whether or not CPI decides that the family is the best placement for them will be decided by evaluation. This is the process in these cases. I promise to keep you all informed.'

The video featuring Ives and Yagers' unsettling parenting behavior is currently under criminal investigation by Tampa Police and the Department of Children and Families Child Protection.
