A British grandmother has become the oldest woman to sail solo around the world non-stop - at the third attempt.

Intrepid Jeanne Socrates, 70, from Ealing, west London, set off on her mammoth journey from Victoria in Canada, in October last year.

She sold her family home to take up the gruelling challenge after the death of her husband, with whom she learned to sail in her 50s.

Mrs Socrates's epic 25,000-mile journey took more than seven months

It was third time lucky for determined Mrs Socrates as she failed in her previous two attempts to complete the 25,000-mile circumnavigation.

Now after 259 days at sea, she has become the oldest woman to solo non-stop circumnavigate the world.

The intrepid sailor's route, which saw her start in Victoria, Canada, took in the southern capes of Chile, South Africa and Western Australia

Speaking after she docked back where she started, in the early hours of Monday, she said her achievement was a victory for the elderly

Speaking after she docked in Victoria, Canada, in the early hours of Monday, she said her achievement was a victory for the elderly.

She said: 'I am the oldest by a long shot. Who else would be crazy enough to do it?

'As soon as you mention your age and number to other people, they get very ageist.

'They classify you and put you in a pocket as being old and no good.

'But we shouldn't be - we are no different as people.'

Explaining how she survived the voyage, Mrs Socrates said: 'Everything ends up cold and damp so you need your sleeping bag to get warm, and dry out a bit. In my gear as well.'

Emailing from her boat during the challenge, she said: 'I've gone around [the world] several times now, so I figure it's time to get my name on the list.

Mrs Socrates's first attempt in November 2009 ended in South Africa when she was forced to stop in Cape Town for an engine replacement. Her second in October 2010 was halted when her boat was damaged in a bad knockdown over 100 miles west of Cape Horn on Day 72

She arrived back at Victoria's Inner Harbour just before 3am on Monday morning - completing her third attempt

'I've enjoyed the many birds keeping me company - many different albatross, both juvenile and adult, have come close to the boat as well as petrels, prions and shearwaters.

'I've also enjoyed the many contacts I've made by radio with people in different countries - all of whom have been very supportive and encouraging.'

Her epic journey from Canada took in several southern capes, including those in Chile, South Africa and Western Australia.

The pre-dawn arrival ended several days of anticipation as light winds along the west coast of British Columbia stalled her return, which was expected on July 5.

John Franklin, from the Ocean Cruising Club (OCC), said: 'Jeanne is one of our most accomplished sailing members in recent years.

'Your friends at OCC are most proud of you, Jeanne.'
