A cyclist who was knocked off his bicycle in a road accident had his iPhone and wallet stolen while he lay in the street unconscious.

The 28-year-old victim was cycling in Peckham, south east London, when he fell to the ground after being hit by a car at the junction of Nigel Road and Rye Lane, witness reports suggest.

It is thought the man, who was in a critical condition last night, was robbed while being moved onto the pavement by passers-by who were pretending to help.

The cyclist was knocked from his bicycle on Tuesday at 2.15am at the junction of Nigel Road and Rye Lane

Witness reports suggest the 28-year-old was hit by a car before falling onto the street and losing consciousness

Tanna Arif, who witnessed the scene from a mini cab office on the same street said: 'I saw a car in the middle of the road with no lights on which looked a bit odd.'

'A little further up the road by a bus stop I saw this guy on the floor.

'He was not moving, but there were some people there trying to help him out of the road. 

'It's possible that they could have mugged him at that point and it's right by a bus stop, so anyone standing there looking concerned could have gone over and come away with his wallet.'

It is thought the man was robbed by people at the scene who moved him off the road before an ambulance took him to hospital

Police are appealing to anyone with more information about the incident which took place on Tuesday at around 2.15am.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The 28-year-old victim fell from his bicycle on Nigel Road, at the junction with Rye Lane, in Peckham at around 2.15am on Tuesday.

'While lying unconscious, an unknown number of suspects stole his iPhone, wallet and cigarettes.

'Anyone who witnessed the robbery is asked to contact officers in Southwark via 101.'

A similar incident took place last 
summer during the London riots, in which a Malaysian student was robbed 
by thieves posing as Good Samaritans after having his jaw broken.

Malaysian student Ashraf Rossli was targeted by two groups of thieves during the London riots last summer

Twenty-year-old Ashraf Rossli was seriously injured when he was attacked in Barking, east London, by a thief who stole his bicycle.

The student from Kuala Lumpar was then approached by a gang of yobs who, while pretending to help him, stole the contents of his rucksack.

The incident sparked public outrage, with video footage of the robbery circulating for months afterwards. 

A 17-year-old boy was found guilty of grievous bodily harm and theft in March.
