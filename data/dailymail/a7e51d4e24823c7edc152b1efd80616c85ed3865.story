Running the show: Diego Costa scored twice for Chelsea in their 6-3 win at Everton

'Diego [Costa] had three chances and scored two goals and one was a good save from Tim Howard, Mourinho told Sky Sports 'So he he is a good finisher, but he doesn't just give us that touch.

'He participates in everything, even in defence. I can remember him making a defensive tackle almost on the edge of our box. He is giving us what we expect.

Costa has made a huge impact since joining the west London side over the summer and his performances drew praise from team-mate John Terry as well as Jamie Redknapp.

'He's been brilliant,' Terry told Sky Sports. 'I played against him in the Champions League and realised he was a top player but when you see him every day he's got everything and he's got off to a flying start with us and long may it continue because that was the difference today.'

Redknapp added: 'That’s the difference. He [Costa] is a game changer. People like that - that’s what you pay big money for. You lose David Luiz and bring in him and Fabregas. What a piece of business that is.'

Although Costa scored twice, the striker managed to get involved with many confrontations during the game with opposition players.

You're booking me: Costa was booked after an on-going scuffle with Coleman in the second half

One scuffle with Seamus Coleman saw the striker booked but former Chelsea front man Eidur Gudjohnsen claims it is just part of his make-up. 

'That’s the character he [Costa] is, Gudjohnsen told Sky Sports. 'I think we saw when he played Chelsea last year, he got involved with John Terry a bit.

'I am convinced that Chelsea can win this season – not only because they look strong, but they’ve got a lot of depth in their squad. None of the other teams have convinced me – look at Man City losing at home. Chelsea have had a great day.'
