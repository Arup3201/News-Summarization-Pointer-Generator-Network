Using a card to withdraw money from a cash machine could soon be a thing of the past.

Japanese technology company Hitachi and Polish banking services provider Itcard S.A. are in the process of installing their biometric ‘Finger Vein’ technology across Poland.

The technology allows people to simply place their finger in a scanner instead of entering a card and pin number to withdraw cash.

Hitachi and Itcard S.A. have announced plans to install 1,730 ATM machines in Poland with their biometric Finger Vein technology (pictured). This allows people to simply scan their finger and then access their account, rather than using a standard card and pin

The project, called Planet Cash, will be implemented in a minimum of 1,730 ATMs in Poland this year.

The technology has already been employed in a few banks in Poland, but now it is being rolled out to the general public.

In a separate development, Intel has unveiled a new 3D interface to replace regular touch screens and keypads.

It enables people to make choices and go through menus on a computer display by 'touching' icons in the air.

A 3D camera is used on the special glass to make the interactive display.

It's somewhat like the technology Tom Cruise's character uses in the film Minority Report.

Intel says it could be employed in future on ATM machines and other devices.

Such depth-sensing cameras have been used to replace other technologies like the computer mouse.

As of yet, however, Hitachi has announced no plans to bring the innovative technology to other countries like the UK.

The technology works by using a combination of a CCD camera and near-infrared light.

When a finger is placed in a scanner, the near-infrared light is passed through the finger.

This is partially absorbed by haemoglobin in the veins and captures a finger vein pattern profile that is unique to everyone.

This is then matched to a pre-registered profile to verify individual identity.

Using the system users can perform the same functions on an ATM that they would with a regular card and pin number – withdraw cash, check balance, make payments and so on.

‘Finger Vein is a key technology in our company’s strategy, Jarosław Chrzanowski, CEO at ITCARD S.A, says in a statement.

‘We’ve already been using this technology for ATMs in the cooperative banking sector.

‘Once again, ITCARD is making a revolution in the market by launching the first biometric shared network in Europe which can be used by all banking customers.’

The technology works by sending near-infrared light through a person's finger. This is partially absorbed by hemoglobin in the finger, which then creates a specific finger vein pattern unique to the person that can be matched to a pre-registered profile

The announcement follows similar vein technology that is being employed elsewhere.

In April, Swedish shoppers signed up to make payments with a simple swipe of their hand.

The
 developers hope hand scanning will become an alternative payment method
 if it is a success during trials in the city of Lund in southern 
Sweden.

The vein-scanning 
terminals have been installed in 15 shops and restaurants after an 
engineering student at the local university came up with the technology 
two years ago while waiting in line to pay.

Some 1,600 signed up for the system which its inventor insists is safer than credit cards.

'Every individual's vein pattern is 
completely unique, so there really is no way of committing fraud with 
this system,' said researcher Fredrik Leifland. 'You always need your 
hand scanned for a payment to go through.'

The plan is to patent the system and expand it around the globe.

To
 sign up, users have to visit a shop or restaurant with a terminal, 
where they scan their palm three times and enter their social security 
and telephone numbers.

A 
text message is then sent to their mobile phone with an activation link 
to a website, with payments taken directly from customer's bank accounts
 twice a month.

More than 1,000 shoppers have signed up to make 
payments with a swipe of their hand. Every person's vein pattern is 
unique, so there really is no way of committing fraud with this system, 
the maker claims
