The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency has ruled Iran has stopped enriching uranium to 20 per cent. Hassan Rouhani's nation has always insisted the process was for energy purposes only

Iran has halted its quest for weapons-grade uranium, according to the UNâ€™s International Atomic Energy Agency.

Inspectors from the IAEA reported that Iran had stopped enriching uranium to 20 per cent purity, which is just one step away from the material required for a viable nuclear weapon.

The move, which comes after Novemberâ€™s talks between Iran and leading nations in Geneva, marks the first stage of an agreement that could open the way for sanctions on the oil-dependent regime to be eased.

Tehran has always insisted that its uranium enrichment was for energy purposes, despite Western concern.

The United States and European Union both suspended some trade and other restrictions against the OPEC oil producer after the United Nations' nuclear watchdog confirmed that Iran had fulfilled its side of an agreement made on November 24.

The announcements, which coincided with a diplomatic row over Iran's role at peace talks on Syria, will allow six months of negotiation.

Under the interim deal, Iran agreed to suspend enrichment of uranium to a fissile concentration of 20 percent, a short technical step away from the level needed for nuclear weapons.

It also has to dilute or convert its stockpile of this higher-grade uranium, and cease work on the Arak heavy water reactor, which could provide plutonium, an alternative to uranium for bombs.

The IAEA said Tehran had begun the dilution process and that enrichment of uranium to 20 percent had been stopped at the two facilities where such work is done.

'The Agency confirms that, as of January 20, 2014, Iran has ceased enriching uranium above five percent U-235 at the two cascades at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP) and four cascades at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP) previously used for this purpose,' its report to member states said.

It was referring to Iran's two enrichment plants, at Natanz and Fordow.

Cascades are linked networks of centrifuge machines that spin uranium gas to increase the concentration of U-235, the isotope used in nuclear fission chain reactions, which is found in nature at concentrations of less than one percent.

The announcement coincided with a diplomatic row at the UN, hosted by Ban Ki-Moon, over Iran's role in the Syria peace talks

However, analysts said much was still unclear about how world powers could achieve their goal of ensuring Iran cannot, secretly or otherwise, develop the capability to build a nuclear weapon.

Mark Dubowitz, head of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington and a proponent of tough sanctions on Iran, said that by providing short-term economic relief, the West was losing future bargaining power with Tehran.

'The interim deal does nothing over the next 12 months to prevent Iran from proceeding with the nuclear-weapon and ballistic-missile research that are the keys to a deliverable nuclear weapon,' he said.

'Ahead of final negotiations, Tehran will be in a stronger position to block peaceful Western efforts to dismantle its military-nuclear programme.'
