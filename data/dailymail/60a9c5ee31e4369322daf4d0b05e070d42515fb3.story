A mother who was protecting her daughter from a drunken attacker was left with 'appalling' injuries after a woman bit into her thumb like 'a pitbull'.

Helen Betts said the pain in her hand when Sandra Bell ripped it open was worse than when she battled breast cancer, Teesside Crown Court heard.

Miss Betts, 57, needed 10 stitches to her thumb to repair the wound, while her nerves and tendons were also severed, leaving her with no feeling in her digit since the attack on October 2012.

'Six years ago I had breast cancer and I 
can honestly say that this was more painful than anything I went though 
with that. I thought she was going to rip my thumb off. What she did was
 inhuman,' she told the court.

Victims: Helen Betts was protecting her daughter Hayley, together left, when she was attacked by Sandra Bell, right, who bit at her hand like 'a pitbull'

Violence: Helen Betts thumb was torn open in the brutal incident. The victim no longer has any feeling in it

But despite the severity of the attack, Bell was spared jail.

Bell of Thornaby-on-Tees, had been at the Mitre Pub in Stockton with a male friend on October 20, 2012, when the pair became 'heavily intoxicated'.

Prosecuting, Paul Lee said that the landlord had 'had enough' and ejected the man from the pub.

He then became aggressive and Bell tried to calm him down.

Hayley Shields, 18, who was working as a barmaid was asked to escort Bell out of the pub.

But once outside Bell assaulted her.

Mr Lee said: 'She grabbed her by the hair and pulled her down to the ground. She was then on top of her.'

Miss
 Shields' mother was inside the pub when the attack 
happened and raced outside when she saw her daughter on the ground.

Miss
 Betts, a school meals caterer, said: 'I ran straight out and told her 
to get off my daughter. She then grabbed my hair and was pulling it.

'I
 went to try and get her hand off and she started biting my thumb. She 
wouldn't stop. There were four people trying to get her off me. But she 
wouldn't let go. I was just screaming in pain.'

After the event: Miss Betts needed 10 stitches to her thumb to repair the wound, while her nerves and tendons were also severed

Today: The thumb, pictured outside court, has healed but the biting incident means she may not recover feeling in it

The
 wound later became infected and led to Miss Betts having to spend more 
than two weeks in hospital and a further two weeks of being visited by a
 nurse at home.

She now has no feeling in it and visible scars.

She said: 'She was a bully and acted like an animal.

'It has had such a massive effect on my life. It has changed my character.

'I have lost a lot of confidence.'

Sentencing
 Bell, Judge John Walford said he had 'immense sympathy' for Miss Betts 
and described the attack as 'absolutely appalling'.

Freed: Despite the severity of the attack Bell was handed a two-year suspended sentence. Her defence told the judge she had suffered mental health problems

Mark Styles, mitigating for Bell, said her behaviour that night was 'out of character.'

He
 told the court that she was on medication at the time for depression 
and she also suffers from a personality disorder for which she now 
receives treatment.

He said she is 'very unlikely' to trouble the court again.

Judge Walford gave Bell a two-year sentence, suspended for two years with supervision.

She was also ordered to pay Â£100 costs. No order for compensation was made.
