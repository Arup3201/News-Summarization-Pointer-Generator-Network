There's nothing more embarrassing than waking up at someone else's place and having to step out in yesterday's outfit.

But now there's a perfect solution to those morning after woes - a top that can be worn 24 different ways in a variety of colours, without the use of any zips, ties or buttons.

The Morf shirt is the brainchild of Israeli-based designer Tamara Salem, who came up with the idea as a way of bringing a playful element to her wardrobe and getting more use out of key pieces.

The future of fashion? The Morf top, which was invented by Israeli-based designer Tamara Salem, can be worn 24 different ways thanks to a clever double-layered construction

Tamara told MailOnline that her invention was 'almost accidental'.

'I was making a shirt as a gift for my best friend's birthday, and I had this vague idea for a multi-layer top with a black front and white back,' she said.

'But only when I actually held it in my hands, I discovered I could flip it and get a totally black shirt, and then flip it again and get an all-white shirt. I realised then how many different options this structure offered,' she explained. 

A mesmerizing video on the project's Kickstarter page, which has raised a whopping $35,600 so far, shows just how the shirt works with the clever use of double-layer construction. 

No more outfit repeats: The shirt, which comes in red, blue or green and costs $80 (about £52), is billed as the perfect solution to a morning after situation

The model in the video begins by wearing the top in plain black with a deep V-neck with grey panels on the sleeves.

Then she pulls it off inside-out and puts it back on, and this time it has black and white stripes in the front and plain black sleeves.

When she rolls up the sleeves, they miraculously become a bright shade of blue. Later, she turns the top inside-out yet again and it becomes grey with a neckline in black and monochrome stripes on the back.

All in all, the top can be worn up to 24 different ways, providing almost an entire month of styles using just one piece of clothing.

'I believe that fashion is all about change, inviting us to re-invent ourselves,' said Tamara. 'I hope to get the attention of women who enjoy being unexpected and ever-changing.'

Versatile: 'I believe that fashion is all about change, inviting us to re-invent ourselves,' said Tamara

Wear it everywhere: The Morf is so versatile, it can be worn for all types of activities - from walking the dog to going to work and then transitioning to night

Tamara says the Morf is so versatile, it can be worn for all types of activities - from walking the dog to going to work and going out on the town at night.

'For the price of a single shirt - you get an entire collection. And did I mention it is a packing and traveling MIRACLE?' she said. 

The Morf top is currently the most popular fashion project on Kickstarter, with 466 backers. 

It comes in both male and female sizes in red, blue or green, and will cost $80 (about £52) when it officially launches online on 29 April.
