Passengers will have to prove that their electronic phones, laptops and tablets do function at UK airports

British Airways announced tough new security measures last night which will see passengers barred from US-bound flights if their electronic devices are not charged up.

In preventing passengers from flying, the airline is going one step further than the guidelines issued on Sunday.

These stated that gadgets will be confiscated before boarding if their owner fails to switch them on and prove they are not packed with explosives.

The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has said it will not allow mobile phones – especially the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy – on to planes bound for the US from some international airports if the devices are not charged.

But British Airways’ rules could see travellers with uncharged electronic devices – some of which are notorious for having short battery lives – not only lose their gadgets but also their seats on the flight.

And unwitting passengers whose batteries have run out during a stop-over, before taking a connecting flight to the US, face being stranded, unable to continue their journey.

A spokesman from British Airways confirmed its new policy, telling the Daily Mail: ‘If [customers] are unable to power up their electronic device they will not be allowed to fly.

If it does not power up then it cannot be placed in hand or hold luggage. We advise our customers to please do all they can to ensure that any electronic device they have is fully powered before you arrive at the airport.

‘For people transferring we advise that they use electronic devices sparingly if they are going to fly on a long journey before getting to London and then transferring on to a US destination.’

The airline also admitted that there will be limited charging facilities at check-in, so there is no chance of any last-minute powering up.

The heightened security comes amid reports two terror networks are working together on a bomb that could evade existing detection measures.

US officials are concerned that a mobile phone, tablet, laptop or other electronic device could be used as a bomb by Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamist Nusra Front, Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria.

The new British Airways measures barring passengers whose electronic items cannot be powered on exceeds guidelines which state the item should simply be confiscated

In 2009 a Yemen-linked bomb maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, built an underwear bomb used in a failed attempt to bring down a plane bound for Detroit.

The TSA did not disclose which airports would be conducting the additional screening, but it was reported last week that passengers at British airports travelling to the US are facing extra checks on their phones.

US officials singled out particular smartphones, including the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy, for security screening on direct flights bound for the States from Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

The BA spokesman added: ‘Safety and security is our top priority at all times and we continue to work closely with airports and governments around the world.‘

We are complying with the US regulations and would advise customers to arrive in good time for their flights both at check-in and also at the boarding gate ... our flights continue to operate as normal.’
