Football manager Paulo Di Canio is caught on camera grieving at the funeral of an Italian fascist connected with a terrorist attack which killed 85 people.

The controversial new Sunderland boss was present when Paolo Signorelli was laid to rest and fellow mourners gave the right-arm salute as the coffin was carried out of the church.

Di Canio, 44, refused to discuss his 
political views as he was unveiled as manager of the struggling Premier 
League side yesterday.

Fascist salute: Paulo Di Canio was at Paolo Signorelli's funeral where mourners gave the right-arm Fascist salute as the 76-year-old's body was carried out of the church

Mourner: Di Canio, centre, at Mr Signorelli's funeral in December 2010. The extreme-right activist was held in prison on remand for eight years over a terrorist bombing which killed 85 people in 1980

He dismissed questions about his views as 'ridiculous and pathetic'. Asked if he is still a fascist he said: 'I don't have to answer that question any more.'

But Di Canio issued a statement today, stating: 'I am not political, I do not affiliate myself to any organisation, I am not a racist and I do not support the ideology of fascism. I respect everyone.'

The pictures emerged today after the political storm over the Italian's appointment intensified when a miners' 
group asked the club to return an iconic banner which hangs in its 
stadium in protest.

Signorelli, who died aged 76 in December 2010, had been a senior member of the Italian Socialist movement which grew out of the collapse of Benito Mussolini's Fascist party after World War II.

He spent eight years in jail on remand after a bomb was set off killing 85 people at Bologna railway station in 1980.

Terror outrage: 85 people were killed in the 1980 bombing of Bologna train station. Paolo Signorelli spent eight years on remand while awaiting trial but was eventually cleared of involvement on appeal

Although he was initially convicted he was cleared on appeal because of insufficient evidence. But he was still found guilty of being part of an 'armed band' and a 'subversion against democracy', The Sun reported.

Di Canio is understood to have been a frequent visitor to the far right politician's home in the final years of his life.

Three days after the appointment of Di Canio, the row has shown no sign of abating. Labour MP David Miliband resigned from his position on the Sunderland board after the controversial Italian was installed as boss.

And the general secretary of the Durham Miners' Association, which has close links to the Sunderland, has spoken out against Di Canio and his far-right views.

Controversy: Di Canio at the funeral of Mr Signorelli. The picture emerged today after the new Sunderland manager refused to discuss his political views at a press conference

Sunderland's ground, the Stadium of 
Light, is named after a Davy lamp in honour of its location on the 
former site of Wearmouth Colliery.

Adding to the team's association with the mining industry, it hosts the Wearmouth Miners' Banner on permanent display.

But
Dave Hopper, who worked at the colliery for 27 years and now heads the 
miners' union, has asked the club to return the commemorative object.

'I,
like many thousands of miners, have supported Sunderland from infancy 
and we are passionate about football,' he said. 'But there are 
principles which are much more important.

‘Our
banner represents the Durham miners’ long struggle for the rights of 
the working class, rights which were annihilated by fascism in Germany, 
Italy, Spain and Chile.

Quit: Labour MP David Miliband resigned as a director of the club after Di Canio's appointment

Iconic: This miners' banner has long hung at the club's Stadium of Light, but a union leader has called for it to be returned over the new manager's fascist links

‘We have a sacred obligation to the 
millions who were wiped out by Hitler, Mussolini and Franco to oppose 
fascism wherever and in whatever context this evil creed raises its 
head, particularly at a time when working people are again being forced 
to pay for capitalism’s crisis as they were in Europe in the 1920s and 
1930s.

‘The appointment
of Di Canio is a disgrace and a betrayal of all who fought and died in 
the fight against fascism. Everyone must speak out and oppose this 
outrage and call on Ellis Short [club owner/chairman] and the Sunderland
board to reverse their decision.'

Di
Canio had a distinguished but controversial playing career for 
teams including Lazio, Juventus and West Ham United, and entered 
management with Swindon Town in 2011.

He
was fined for giving a fascist salute to ultra-nationalist fans of 
Lazio, and defended himself saying: 'I am a fascist, not a racist.'

Asked yesterday if 
the focus on politics was making his job more difficult, he said: 'No. 
Because always there is an issue if people try to put you in difficulty 
for a ridiculous and pathetic situation which doesn't represent Paolo Di
Canio. So I'm not worried.'

When
he was pressed on the issue of his political beliefs, Di Canio replied:
'The people talking about this are offending my parents - I don't give 
the chance to offend my parents and my daughter.'

Controversy: Di Canio has refused to answer questions about his political views since being appointed manager of Sunderland

Bullish: The manager has repeatedly dodged questions about his apparent fascist sympathies
