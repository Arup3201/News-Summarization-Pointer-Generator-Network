From lavishly decorated rooms to a stuffed jaguar and table football, the private life of a dictator has been laid bare by this extraordinary series of pictures.

Taken from inside the former presidential palace of deposed Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the photographs show some of the former dictator's everyday enjoyments, as well as some of this more extravagent expenditures.

The palace, in Sidi Dhrif, in a seafront suburb of capital city Tunis, has been left virtually untouched since Ben Ali and his family fled in January 2011 in the face of the first of the Arab Spring uprisings.

The pictures offer revealing insights into the life of Ben Ali, who now lives in exile in Saudi Arabia with his wife, and how he spent his time with his young family.

While among the items they left behind include family portraits, statues and expensive-looking marble carvings, there also rests children's toys and DVDs of blockbuster films, untouched since the family fled. The former Tunisian presidency was toppled in the first of the Arab Springs after having been in power for 23 years.

The country then voted in its first election since the uprising in October 2011, which led to the appointment of the Ennahda Movement, a moderate Islamist party in Tunisia, which nominated Hamadi Jebali to be prime minister.

Mr Jebali today kicked off viewing for an auction of thousands of luxury items once owned by ousted dictator Ben Ali and his family.

Jebali inspected 40 luxury cars, thousands of clothing, jewellery items and art works on the eve of the public auction which is being held in the Tunis suburb of Gammarth in a bid to raise millions of euros for government coffers.

Highlight of the month-long sale is 
expected to be the cars, which include a Lamborghini Gallardo LP 460, a 
Bentley Continental sports car, an armoured Cadillac and a Maybach

About 42,000 items have been confiscated by the state from the palace, which was home to statues including the one pictured above left, in the living, room, while two degree certificates were left hanging in Ben Ali's personal study

Among the luxurious items were more everyday objects, such as this DVD of the Hollywood blockbuster Mr & Mrs Smith, starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie

The palace itself towers over the sea on a Sidi Bou Said hill, and includes all the hallmarks of a luxurious lifestyle, including vaulted ceilings, a seaside helicopter landing pad, a grandiose pool, two antique cannons, and a chandelier in nearly every room.

Journalist Youssef Gaigi had never seen images of the palace before visiting it to report on the state auction of the former dictator's confiscated belongings.

He told CNN: 'It was full of extravagance and extreme luxury and bad taste.

'All these signs of power... Nobody 
could afford to have such things in Tunisia, unless they were the 
president -- and not just any president, but a dictator.'

 But journalists who visited the palace were also taken by some of the more revealing everyday objects.

Tunisian journalist Youssef Gaigi told CNN: 'It was very interesting because you enter into the private life of a president and discover a human side which we didn't have access to.'

Earlier this week acting finance minister Slim Besbes said items valued at less than 5,000 euros would be sold at fixed price, but anything priced above that would be put to auction.

The government hopes to raise at least 10 million euros from the sale.

Ben Ali, who fled in the face of the first of last year's Arab Spring uprisings, lives in exile in Saudi Arabia with his wife.

Commentators however say his overthrow has done little to address the economic grievances that fuelled the revolt, with protests against the new government multiplying in recent weeks.
