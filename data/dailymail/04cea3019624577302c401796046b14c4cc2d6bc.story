A giant asteroid that astronomers have compared to the size of a city block flew past Earth in the early hours of this morning.

The chunk of space rock - dubbed 2012 LZ1 - is up to 700metres wide and passed our planet at 2am GMT.

It was 3.35million miles away, roughly 14 times the distance between Earth and the moon.

Fly-by: A giant asteroid that astronomers have compared to the size of a city block hurtled past Earth at 2am GMT

While there was no danger of a collision, it was still close enough to be filmed.

But as it was less than 4.65million miles away and more than 150metres wide, the asteroid was still classified as potentially hazardous.

It was spotted four days ago by astronomer Rob McNaught when he was looking through the Uppsala Schmidt telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in Autralia.

Scientists have now been able to calculate its orbit and claim it will again pass through Earth's orbit in 2016.

Two weeks ago, a 16ft-wide asteroid narrowly missed Earth by a mere 8,900 miles when it hurtled past our mortal coil at 38,000 miles per hour.

At its closest, that fly-by was about the same distance as a flight from New York City to New Zealand.

Scientists weren't worried, though. Asteroid 2012 KT42, as astronomers dubbed it, likely would have burned up in the planet's atmosphere before ever getting a chance to wreak havoc on the surface.

But Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said the asteroid was the 6th-closest miss on record.

It was the second hunt of hurtling space rock to come near the planet in two days.

The day before, a 64-foot asteroid flew past Earth about 32,000 miles away.
