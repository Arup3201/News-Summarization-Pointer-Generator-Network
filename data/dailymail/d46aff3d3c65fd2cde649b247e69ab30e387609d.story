Football's Golden Years: From Sir Stanley to Gazza, Kenny to Keegan, Pele to Best... the game's famous names have always been driven to succeed

Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker often talks about his days as a Leicester City player but it seems the ex-England striker isn't proud of all of his activities in a blue shirt.

The 53-year-old was left embarrassed on Monday evening when his friend, former snooker player Willie Thorne, shared a picture of him posing in front of a Fiat Uno car during his spell with the Foxes.

Thorne, who was born in Leicester like Lineker, posted the image on Twitter along with the message: 'I remember this like yesterday gary was so excited to get his first sponsership (sic) car how times have changed'

'Cooler than the car....just!' tweeted Lineker after seeing this image of Bryan Robson, himself and Ian Rush

It didn't take former Everton and Barcelona forward Lineker long to reply as he tweeted Thorne: 'Ha! B******!'

Lineker is pictured wearing a full  home kit in the snap, with the car emblazoned with the words 'Gary Lineker drives a Fiat'. He spent seven years playing for Leicester before moving to Goodison Park in 1985.

The exchange between Thorne and his long-term pal led to the pair tweeting and retweeting a series of pictures featuring footballers and cars over the years.

Among those featured were Brazil icon Pele, Tottenham legends Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa and West Ham fan favourites Bobby Moore and Sir Geoff Hurst.
