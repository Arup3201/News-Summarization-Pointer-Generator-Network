The daughter of a man accused of murdering his wife 16 months ago and throwing himself off an 80ft cliff said her father drunkenly confessed that his wife choked on her vomit after he tied her up and taped her mouth shut.

The body of Dawn Viens, 39, has never been found after she vanished in October 2009. Jacqueline Viens told a court yesterday her father David - a chef - said her body would never be found and had previously joked that cooking someone was a good way to get rid of the body.

Police tore up the floors and walls of Viens' Thyme Contemporary Cafe in Lomita with shovels and cadaver dogs to try and find her remains, but to no avail.

Where is she? David Viens is on trial accused of murdering his wife Dawn, 39, left, who his daughter said choked on her vomit after he tied her up and Duct taped her mouth closed

Jacqueline, 22, testified against her 
father on the opening day of his murder trial in downtown Los Angeles. 
Viens is confined to a wheelchair after his suicide attempt, according 
to the Los Angeles Times.

He denies killing his wife.

His daughter recalled the conversation
she had with her father one night in 2009. She recalled him saying that
Dawn Viens had been needling him and he just wanted to sleep.

He'd tried barricading their bedroom 
door with a dresser but when that didn't work, he tied her up and taped 
her mouth. The next morning, Dawn Viens was dead.

She said her father told her, through tears, that her body would never be found.

When he was arrested, he told investigators a similar story.

Defense attorney Fred McCurry 
questioned Jacqueline's account of the conversation, saying she had both drank 
and smoked marijuana the night it took place and her memory was 'fuzzy'.

She did testify that she had never seen the couple argue and they 'seemed like they loved each other'.

Viens claims his wife ran away to the 
mountains from their restaurant 16 months ago after an argument over 
whether she should go for drug rehabilitation.

But
authorities were suspicious because of ‘inconsistent statements’ he 
gave and the fact she left behind her wallet, mobile phone and other 
personal belongings.

His new girlfriend, Kathy Galvan, then 
took over Mrs Viens’s job and moved into her home, before he was seen 
throwing out his wife’s belongings into a dustbin behind his restaurant,
police said.

Speaking about this, Jacqueline said 
she had been asked by her father to bag up Dawn's clothes and take them 
to a storage unit. The rest were thrown out.

The 22-year-old also said that Dawn Viens was no saint.

'She'd wake up in the morning and drink all day long,' adding that the pair had done cocaine together.  

She also told jurors yesterday that 
after the 'drunken confession', her father asked her to send a text 
message from Dawn Viens' phone to one of his wife's friends saying: 
'This is Dawn. I'm OK. I'm in Florida and I'm here to start over.'

Then she got rid of the phone to protect her dad.

Cover up?: Police say he may have remodelled the café with new floors and walls to conceal his wife's body but his daughter believes he may have cooked her

Suicide bid? The cliffs near the Point Vicente Interpretive Center in Rancho Palos Verdes in California. Viens jumped over cliffs in the area as he was being chased by police, falling 80ft, but 'amazingly' survived

Police upgraded the case from a missing person case to a homicide after they found blood inside Viens apartment.

They had been looking for him when they saw the suspect and Kathy Galvan in his car on a road near the coastline by Point Vicente Interpretive Center near Rancho Palos Verdes.

He sped off to a lighthouse car park, jumped out and began grappling with Ms Galvan before officers tried to intervene. But Viens broke free and seemed to purposely leap off the cliff to the beach below.

‘Viens dove off a 100ft cliff to avoid talking to our detectives, and that is somewhat telling,’ Sheriff's Department detective chief Bill McSweeney said.

He was placed in a medically-induced coma but ultimately survived the attempt - though with critical injuries.
