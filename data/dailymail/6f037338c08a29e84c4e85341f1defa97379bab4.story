Dressed in a sweat top, skinny jeans and pumps, it’s the perfect casual look for a night at the cinema.

This, however, was Cressida Bonas dressed for a date at the Kensington Odeon with her former boyfriend, Prince Harry.

The sight of the pair furtively slipping out of the pictures after a mid-week date led to fevered speculation yesterday that their romance may be blossoming again.

Observers have noted in recent weeks that Cressida has been dressing more provocatively in a series of flesh-baring outfits, just as Kate glammed up her look during her brief split from Prince William.

It is the second time the couple, who dated for two years before suddenly splitting back in April, have been seen in public together over the last few days.

On Sunday night the 25-year-old budding actress was a guest at a concert in London to mark the end of the prince’s remarkable Invictus Games for injured service personnel.

There are also reports they have been seen together in a West London bar.

The couple were accompanied by a group of friends on their visit to the cinema (where Princess Diana often used to take her two sons) on Tuesday. It’s just a short hop from Harry’s bachelor pad at Kensington Palace.

And their viewing matter – Sex Tape, which sees Cameron Diaz’s character try to spice up her love life with a raunchy home video – wasn’t exactly the stuff of hearts and flowers.

But the fact that they felt comfortable enough to go out in public together again suggests their relationship is getting back on track.

Friends say they are taking things ‘slow and steadily’ – very steadily as far as Cressida is concerned.

One member of her circle told the Mail that until recently the former dance student was still in two minds as to whether she had done the right thing in splitting up from the prince.

‘She was clearly very much in love with him but the issues that drove a wedge between them – Harry’s commitment and the pressure that going out with a prince brings – were still clearly there,’ the source said.

Contrary to reports, Cressida was not present at Harry’s black-tie 30th birthday bash at Clarence House on Wednesday night. Instead she joined friends at the relaunch of a club in Belgravia, dressed in typically funky attire of black shorts and canvas pumps.

When the couple realised they had been spotted by photographers as they came out of the cinema, Harry and his ex quickly went their separate ways, with the prince jumping into his waiting Range Rover along with his bodyguards and Cressida hailing a taxi further down the road.

On Sunday the couple also deliberately didn’t speak, even though they were yards from each other in the VIP area of the Olympic Park for Harry’s concert, and Cressida had raced back from a friend’s wedding in Italy to be there.

In fact the blonde stuck like glue to her best friend, Princess Eugenie – widely believed to have introduced the couple – who was openly kissing and cuddling her own boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank.

The dilemma for Cressida, says one who knows her well, is simple: Can she dovetail her fondness for the fourth in line to the throne with her desire to seek a career on the stage?

Having recently starred in a well-received play, There’s A Monster In The Lake, posed for Vanity Fair’s Best Dressed List and snagged a bit part in a new film with model Cara Delevingne, Cressida’s career is going from strength to strength. ‘All this not only made her feel good about herself but made her stock rise,’ says a family friend.

Harry is said to have always been ‘madly keen’ on Cressida. According to sources, she was never far from his mind and he has deluged the blonde with calls and texts. One friend continued: ‘The really interesting story here is how Harry has changed since he has known Cressie. He was a liability, but is now one of the Royal Family’s most successful ambassadors.

‘I am certain Cressida is at least partly responsible for the metamorphosis. She is a very good influence on his life.’
