Thousands of emails have been accidentally deleted due to what's believed to be the second Gmail bug in as many weeks.

The glitch occurred between 15 and 22 January and caused thousands of users to delete the wrong emails, or report other users for spam accidentally. 

Google said the bug has now been fixed and is urging people to check their Trash folders for missing emails.

The tech giant has not explained what caused the glitch.

Many Gmail users complained they were either locked out of their accounts, couldn’t access the service, or were missing emails, at the end of last week.

At 2:12pm on 24 January, Google acknowledged the problem, telling users: 'We're investigating reports of an issue with Gmail. We will provide more information shortly.'

Yesterday morning Google sent a service update that read: ‘You may have been impacted by a recent issue in Gmail that inadvertently caused some actions (e.g. delete, report spam) taken while viewing a message to be applied to a different message.

‘The issue occurred between January 15 and January 22 and is now fixed.'

During the glitch, whenever a user opened one email and performed a certain action - such as deleting it – Gmail incorrectly applied that action to another email.

Similarly, if someone reported a user for spam, the report was sent about a different user.

Google said the fault only affected 0.2 per cent of its users and was concentrated on mobile browsers, offline versions of the service, and Gmail on iOS apps.

The bug has been fixed and missing data should be restored, although Google is urging users to check their Trash folders just in case

This latest glitch is believed to be separate from a bug that caused the Gmail outage last week. 

Hundreds took to Twitter to complain 
on Friday after being unable to use the service using the hashtag 
#whengmailwasdown.

Rival Yahoo tweeted its users several times to tell them Google's service was down on Friday.

Marissa Mayer's firm immediately came under fire online for jumping of a rival's technical problems.

However, less than an hour later, the tweets were deleted.

Yahoo then issued an apology, telling its users 'Earlier today, a tweet
 that reflected bad judgment was posted and has been deleted. We 
apologise to @Google and the @Gmail team.'

The firm said it has fixed the problem and any missing data should have been restored, however, it is still urging all users to check their accounts for any missing emails.

‘We encourage you to check your Trash and Spam folders before February 14, 2014 for any items you did not intend to delete or mark as spam and move them back to your inbox,’ said Google.

This latest glitch is believed to be separate from a bug that caused email addresses to be accidentally added to messages.

Last week, a Californian user of Microsoft's Hotmail service received thousands of blank emails after the bug automatically inserted his email address into new messages.

This was believed to have been a result of the outage.

Hundreds took to Twitter to complain 
after being unable to use the service using the hashtag 
#whengmailwasdown - and Yahoo even tweeted about it.

The rival email provider tweeted its users several times to tell them Google's service was down -
 before deleting and ussuing an apology.

One tweet said: 'Earlier 
today, a tweet that reflected bad judgment was posted and has been 
deleted. We apologize to @Google and the @Gmail team.'

Yahoo users were victim to a similar outage last month when the service was unavailable for some users for up to a week.
