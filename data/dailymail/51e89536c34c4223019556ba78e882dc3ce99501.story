Love them or hate them, Brussels sprouts are a Christmas day staple. And now one veggie-loving juice company thinks that we should be slurping our sprouts the rest of winter too.

The UK's first ever Brussels sprout juice has been launched by Juice Club, going on sale at the exclusive food store Fortnum & Mason.

Hoping to become this season's super juice staple, this intriguing health drink promises to deliver lots of health benefits and help keep bugs at bay.

Can you stomach it? Juice Club have launched the first-ever Brussels sprout juice and it is available now at luxury store, Fortnum & Mason

The makers claim the juice offers a 'distinctly clean and punchy way to enjoy the Yuletide super food' and they're convinced it will rival the oh-so-virtuous kale in the health stakes.

Sprouts are rich in vitamin C and K, which helps fight off infection. They also contain sulforaphane, which reduces risk from cancer, as well as lowering cholesterol.

For those hard-core vegetable juice 
addicts (yes you, Miranda Kerr), the Brussels sprout can be combined with spinach and kale or 
enjoyed as a clean shot on its own.

For the less adventurous foodies, the sprouts can be mixed into a punchy £3.95 concoction of pears, cinnamon and spices or apples and cranberry.

Will they dare? Miranda Kerr (L) and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are huge super juice fans, but will Brussels sprout juice become their new health essential?

Dan Thomson, bartender of cult cocktail bars B.Y.O.C and Milk & Honey, said: 'The limited edition flavours are 
perfectly enjoyed on a chilly morning walk to work or to revitalise 
yourself before another festive party.'

Elouise Bauskis, Nutritional Therapist at The Nutri Centre said: 'Brussela sprouts are a Cruciferous vegetable that are packed with vitamin K, vitamin C, folic acid, calcium and magnesium.

'As a juice I’d imagine the taste may be very intense, but by adding pear, cinnamon and spice or apples and cranberry would surely improve it. Combined with spinach and kale it’d become a super shot of green goodness.

'If you have thyroid issues, I wouldn’t have it too often, as Brussels sprouts are goitrogenic especially when consumed raw, meaning they can interfere with the absorption of iodine, which is essential for thyroid function.''

Jessica Anderson from Jessica's Recipe Bag food blog, said: 'Brussels sprouts are considered to be a super food. They are packed with numerous vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals.

Good stuff: Brussels sprouts provide a good source of vitamin A, B6, C, E, K, potassium, manganese, folate acid, iron, glucosinolates, riboflavin, and thiamin

'Brussels sprouts juice does provide a great source of vitamin A, B6, C, E, K, potassium, manganese, folate acid, iron, glucosinolates, riboflavin, and thiamin. By juicing Brussels sprouts, it allows your body to absorb all the nutrients found inside easier than if eaten.

'Many people find that Brussels sprouts are difficult to digest and cause bloating therefore juicing them is a good alternative

'I do not support the claim that this juice is sure to keep winter infections at bay, it may help if used in combination with a balanced diet. Stress and lack of sleep also effect our immune system.

'I saw that you can buy a small shot of Brussels sprout juice for £2.00. A typical shot is around 50ml. You can buy 1 Kg of sprouts for less then £2 and make more then 10 shots with a good juicer.

'It concerns me that we are buying into the premise that juicing is a quick fix to optimising our health where as in fact juices like these are expensive and not a substitute for healthy eating.'

 Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who has one of showbiz's most enviable figures, recently praised her ‘delicious green juice' which she described as 'a 
great way to start the day.'

But what’s behind this mysterious 
concoction? Along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber,
kale and parsley, the Japanese wholefood Chlorella is added to the 
juice.

And it’s not just Rosie 
who’s caught the Chlorella bug, Miranda 
Kerr has admitted that she takes Chlorella supplements to keep her skin 
in check.

green vegetable smoothie

Nadia Brydon, who’s a 
nutritionist and green food expert at Sun Chlorella, has shared her tips
for the perfect morning smoothie....

'With
everyone from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to Millie Mackintosh drinking 
green smoothies recently, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is just 
another beauty fad.

'We
all know that we’re probably not eating enough greens, yet our greens 
contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat, and are the 
most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help 
keep us healthy. 

Green
smoothies can be high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness, 
and magnesium, which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as 
nature’s tranquiliser, helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so 
it’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it! 

You’ll
notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their 
juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily 
serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content 
equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 
32oz steak.

Perhaps 
most importantly, these drinks provide large quantities of whole food 
natural vitamins and minerals and help increase our daily intake of 
fruit and vegetables – for busy people who still want to remain healthy,
this is hugely important.

Smoothies
are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients 
which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume
food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates. We recommend the 
Rolls Royce of blenders, the Vitamix blender, as it breaks down the cell
walls of fresh, whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients. 
It also saves time as all of the ingredients can be added at once.'

Miranda
and Rosie’s green juices and smoothies are so nutritious, simply 
because greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we 
eat, and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily 
basis to help keep us healthy. 

Combining
these into an easy to drink smoothie can help busy people cram as many 
of these vegetables into their daily diet as possible. Juicing and 
blending raw green vegetables and living micro greens (sprouts) 
containing fresh vibrant green chlorophyll are extremely nutritious ways
of creating optimum health and energy.

Just juice: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has revealed that she loves Chlorella (like those pictured right) green juices

Juicing
or blending any raw green vegetable, especially the living leafy 
varieties, is an effective way of increasing oxygen in the body and 
helping to build healthy tissues. Oxygen maintains life and is a 
rejuvenator of all body systems.

Green
smoothies containing the ingredients seen in Rosie and Miranda’s can be
high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness.

The
spinach in Rosie’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium, which is 
found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature’s tranquiliser, 
helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it’s no wonder so many 
busy celebs are trying it! 

You’ll
notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their 
juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily 
serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content 
equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 
32oz steak – vitamin D in particular is important for winter, as this 
nutrient is produced by natural sunlight, and long cold winters can 
cause Brits to become deficient, meaning it’s important to top up where 
possible.   To make a Rosie or Miranda style green 
smoothie, try the delicious recipe below at home. Freshly juiced fruits 
should always be diluted 50:50 with water in order to dilute the sugar 
content.  Blend the below ingredients, adding the water first.•    600ml mineral water (still) •    ½ chopped cucumber (skin & pips included) •    ¼ peeled avocado •    1 chopped celery stick •    Juice of ½ lemon or lime •    ¼ teaspoon unrefined salt •   
Sun Chlorella ‘A’ tablets: initially starting off with 5 tablets for 
the first three days, moving up to 10 for the next 3 days and then 15 
tablets herein after. •    Small double handful (60-80mg) of mixed 
green leaves from the following (they can be combined): spinach, 
watercress, rocket, savoy cabbage, chard, lettuce, chicory, kale, bok 
choy, sprigs of mint, parsley, coriander, basil.
