In the film Madagascar, Marty the zebra famously wonders whether he is black with white stripes or white with black stripes.

This one is neither - and was was spotted in Kenya by wildlife photographer Paul Goldstein who says in all his 25 years in Africa, he has never seen a zebra with such an unusual coat.

He says, unlike most zebra, it has never travelled with a herd and has a nasty temper if ever anyone gets close.

Spot the difference: Zebras are normally social animals but appear to have banished this unusual specimen because of his spotty back

Remarkable: The zebra was pictured by wildlife photographer and safari guide Paul Goldstein who says in all his 25 years in the wilds of Africa, he has never seen a zebra with such an unusual coat

Paul first came across the animal a 
couple of years ago whilst guiding in Kenya from Kicheche Camp, a set of
 camps he owns, and has tracked its movements ever since.

He said: 'This animal was on its own, extremely bad tempered and I could not get a shot.

'No-one
 believed me when I told them of this remarkable phenomenon. This time, 
on a long game drive in the Masai Mara I saw him again.

'He appears to have no mates and a lot of scars, however the differences are vast.

Unique body-prints: Zebra are usually very sociable creatures who like to travel in herds. Some experts say they developed stripes over time to help them recognise each other

Thinking: In the film Madagascar, Marty the zebra famously wonders whether he is black with white stripes or white with black stripes

'The mane is short and completely 
black the hooped markings on its legs are completely different to normal
 ones, it has the shape of a donkey it is much darker all over, but 
those spots are incredible.

'Every zebra in Africa has slightly different markings, but this one has taken that to extremes.'

Paul guides wildlife photographic holidays for Exodus all over the world, but specifically in the poles and Africa.

Experts have come up with a variety of explanations as to why zebra have stripes.

The stripey patterns that cover their bodies are as distinctive as human fingerprints and some scientists say they evolved in such a way to make it easier to recognise each other.

Others say it is to confuse predators when they bunch into groups to avoid attack.

And this year a group of scientists came up with the theory that zebra developed stripes to keep blood-sucking flies at bay after putting out different coloured models of horses in a field - one brown, one black, one white, and one with black-and-white stripes.

The model with black-and-white stripes attracted the least number of flies.
