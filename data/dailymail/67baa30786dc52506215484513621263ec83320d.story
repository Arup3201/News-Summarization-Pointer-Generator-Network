Neymar once again stole the show by scoring four goals - including a perfect hat-trick- as Brazil continued their strong start under new manager Dunga by sweeping aside Japan in Singapore.

Just three days after Brazil saw off Argentina in the Superclasico de las Americas, Neymar, the country's 22-year-old captain and talisman, was unstoppable after opening the scoring in the first half.

Brazil: Jefferson; Danilo, Miranda, Gil, Filipe Luís; Luiz Gustavo, Elias, Willian, Oscar; Diego Tardelli, Neymar

Goals: Neymar 18, 47, 77, 81 

Japan: Kawashima, Ota, Sakai, Shiotani, Morishige, Tanaka, Taguchi, Morioka, Shibasaki, Okazaki, Kobayashi 

The striker put in a superb display and 
his quartet of goals included one with his left foot, one with his right
 foot and one with his head.

Japan started brightly, and despite resting their most established stars such as Keisuke Honda and Shinji Kagawa, the Blue Samurai caused Brazil some troubles in the first half.

But Neymar was a constant threat, ably assisted by Diego Tardelli, who looked to have gained confidence from his two goals against Argentina in Beijing, and was far more involved in the build-up play than in the Superclassico.

And it was from one such moment of combination that Brazil went ahead after 18 minutes. 

The Barcelona forward almost got on the scoresheet early on, bending a beautiful free kick over the wall only to see it hit the crossbar

Even before that the Barcelona striker had shown that he was always the most dangerous player on the pitch, striking the angle of post and bar with a beautiful free kick.

Japan continued to make their opponents work, Kobayashi proving a handful up front and Tanaka providing energy from midfield, but they rarely forced Jefferson in the Brazil goal to make a save, as Dunga's side began to take control in Singapore.

And in the second half it was the Neymar show, the 22-year-old sliding home from a brilliant Coutinho pass, tucking home a rebound after the Liverpool midfielder had seen a shot saved, and then rising highest at the back post to score a fourth. 

Japan had no answer to his magnificence, neither preventing the supply of ball, or, as a more experienced and perhaps more cynical side might have done, stopping him with fouls before he got into full flight.

Instead 
they stood off the Barcelona star, and he needed no second invitation. 
With the likes of Oscar, Willian and Coutinho, and later Kaka and 
Robinho, feeding his runs, Neymar could even have had more. 

With
 the score at 2-0 he was played through on the left side, but missed the
 target after cutting cleverly back inside. It mattered little though, 
as the chances kept coming for Brazil's favourite son, who now has 40 
goals in just 58 games for his country.Tardelli dropped deep and threaded a 
delightful ball through the Japan defence, and Neymar, quicker and 
stronger than his marker, collected it, before rounding keeper Eiji 
Kawashima and slotting home.
