Investigation: Culture secretary Maria Miller, who is at the centre of an expenses row about her property, could be sitting on a £1million profit on its value

The Cabinet minister at the centre of an expenses row about her property could be sitting on a £1million profit on its value, it has emerged.

Maria Miller, the culture secretary, is being investigated for claiming £90,000 in taxpayer-funded allowances for a home where her parents also lived.

The minister and her husband Iain bought the large detached house in Wimbledon, south London for just £234,000 in 1995.

She has charged the taxpayer for mortgage repayments and various other expenses since she became an MP in 2005, designating it her second home, with her main home a rented property in her Basingstoke constituency.

It is now worth an estimated £1.27million, according to the property website Zoopla.

Its value has surged by £220,701 in just one year, adding a fifth to its value, the website estimates, and if rented out it would fetch around £4,700 a month.

The rules state that second homes must be ‘exclusively’ for the use of MPs.

Mrs Miller is being investigated for her claims from 2005 to 2009 by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, who has sent a 100-page report into her conduct to MPs.

In it, the Commissioner Kathryn Hudson is understood to have concluded that for at least part of the four years Mrs Miller should not have claimed second home costs for her London home, where it understood her family live.

After a cross-party group of MPs scrutinise the report, they have the power to suspend her or order her to repay her expenses.

Claims: Ms Miller is being investigated for claiming £90,000 in taxpayer-funded allowances for her London home while she was also renting properties in her Basingstoke constituency, including this barn

Mrs Miller became notorious after one of her special advisers threatened reporters investigating her bosses’ expenses that Mrs Miller was involved in implementing the Leveson report.

The warning has been seen by many as a salutary indication of the dangers of politicians regulating the press.

Forced to resign: Labour MP Tony McNulty had to resign as London minister and repay £14,000 after he claimed for a home where his parents lived

Sources close to the minister say she believes she has done nothing wrong, and pointed out that her expenses have been audited twice in the wake of the expense scandal in 2009 and no wrongdoing was found. She claims her parents moved into the house to help her look after her three children.

But Labour MP Tony McNulty had to resign as London minister and repay £14,000 after he claimed for a home where his parents lived during the expenses scandal.

But the prime minister is said to be keen for her to stay in post given she is one of just four women in his cabinet. 

If she were to sell the home, Mrs Miller would be entitled to keep the £1million profit under parliamentary rules.

When the expenses scandal was exposed, it emerged she had claimed £190 for repairs to carpets and £90 for garden work, while a claim for crockery was turned down by the fees office.

Last year it emerged in figures released by the parliamentary watchdog Ipsa that 20 MPs had made a profit by selling their taxpayer-funded second homes - prompting calls for them to pay the money back.
