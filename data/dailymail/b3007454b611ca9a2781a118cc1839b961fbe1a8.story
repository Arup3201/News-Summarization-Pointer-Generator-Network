The Libyan militant accused of masterminding the deadly Benghazi attacks that have become a flashpoint in U.S. politics pleaded not guilty to conspiracy Saturday in a federal courtroom in Washington.

In a 10-minute hearing held amid tight security, Ahmed Abu Khattala spoke just two words, both in Arabic. He replied 'yes' when asked to swear to tell the truth and 'no' when asked if he was having trouble understanding the proceeding.

A grand jury indictment handed up 
under seal Thursday says Abu Khattala took part in a conspiracy to 
provide material support and resources to terrorists in the 2012 attacks
 that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

The government said it soon would file more charges against Abu Khattala.

During his initial court appearance, 
Abu Khattala listened via headphones to a translation of the 
proceedings. He wore a two-piece black track suit, had a beard and long 
curly hair, both mostly gray, and kept his hands, which were not 
handcuffed, behind his back.

the hearing. Abu Khattala's court-appointed lawyer, Michele Peterson, 
entered the not guilty plea.

Facciola 
ordered the defendant's continued detention, but Facciola did not say 
where Abu Khattala would be held.

The
 U.S. Marshals Service said it had taken custody of Abu Khattalah, who 
now was confined to a detention facility in the capital region, ending a
 harried day for the Libyan.

U.S. special forces captured Abu Khattala in Libya two weeks ago.

Officials had been questioning Abu Khattala aboard a Navy ship that transported him to the United States.

Abu Khattala was flown by military helicopter from the ship to a National Park Service landing pad in the city's Anacostia neighborhood, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the transfer publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

A criminal complaint filed last year that was unsealed after his capture charges him with terror-related crimes, including killing a person during an attack on a federal facility, a crime that can be punishable by death.

The prosecution in a courthouse in the nation's capital reflects the Obama administration's stated position of trying suspected terrorists in the American criminal justice system even as Republicans call for Abu Khattala and others to be held at the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Critics say suspected terrorists don't deserve the legal protections afforded by the American court. The Obama administration considers the civilian justice system fairer and more efficient.

The violence on the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon quickly became a political flashpoint. Republicans accused the White House, as the 2012 presidential election neared, of intentionally misleading the public about what prompted the attacks. The White House accused Republicans of politicizing a national tragedy.

Abu Khattala was a prominent figure in Benghazi's circles of extremists. He was popular among young radicals and lived openly in the eastern Libyan city, spotted at cafes and other public places, even after the Obama administration publicly named him as a suspect.

He is accused of being a member of the Ansar al-Shariah group, the powerful Islamic militia that the U.S. believes was behind the attack.

He acknowledged in an interview with The Associated Press in January that he was present during the storming of the U.S. mission in Benghazi. But he denied involvement in the attack, saying he was trying to organize a rescue of trapped people.

In the attack, gunmen fired rocket-propelled grenades and stormed the mission, with many waving the black banners of Ansar al-Shariah, a powerful Islamic militia.

The compound's main building was set ablaze. Ambassador Chris Stevens suffocated to death inside and another American was shot dead. Later in the evening, gunmen attacked and shelled a safe house, killing two more Americans.

At the time, several witnesses said they saw Abu Khattala directing fighters at the site.

No evidence has emerged that Abu Khattala was involved in the later attack on the safe house.

An anonymous law enforcement official told the New York Times that 'brutal' conditions in Libya slowed down the investigation.

'We were dealing with one of the most non-permissive environments at the time, and our guys were able to put together a case,' the source said.

'We have plenty of evidence to convict this guy,' the source told the Times. 'Now itâ€™s just a matter of getting him to the courthouse.'

Abu Khattala is one of just a few cases in which the administration has captured a suspected terrorist overseas and interrogated him for intelligence purposes before bringing him to federal court to face charges.

Those cases include Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, who was arrested in Jordan in March 2013 and turned over to U.S. agents. A jury in New York City convicted him in March of conspiring to kill Americans.
