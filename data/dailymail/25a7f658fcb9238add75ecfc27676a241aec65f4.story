The sister of the Reddit user who ‘confessed’ to murder on the internet to protect her apparently claimed today that it was all a prank.

The sister said that it was an ‘ill-advised prank’ by her ‘scrawny gamer’ brother and that he was just doing it to get more popularity on the Internet.

Her brother, using the name Naratto, had claimed that his sister had an ‘abusive meth addict boyfriend’ and wrote on Reddit using a meme that he ‘killed him with his own drugs while he was unconscious and they ruled it as an overdose.’

Heavy: The user, named Naratto, posted a thread to the meme, pictured, with the title 'Finally have the guts to say it' late on Saturday night

The meme is usually reserved for 
innocuous confessions so, within minutes of its posting Saturday, stunned Reddit users began 
commenting on the photo, asking if the disclosure was true and if so 
when it happened.

The meme, which refers to anything this is shared and spread across the internet, quickly spread and media outlets began reporting on the possible crime. By Tuesday, the posting  had reached more than 3224 comments.

The sister however claimed that she had never even known anyone to overdose, let alone a boyfriend.

The claims are further twists in a 
mystery which has sparked huge speculation on the Internet as to whether
the ‘confession’ was actually true.

It has also ignited a debate about how the Internet polices itself with claims on Reddit that one user had tipped off the FBI.

Jenny Shearer, national cyber-crime 
spokeswoman for the FBI, said that as a matter of policy it does not 
confirm if a tip has been received or is being investigated.

She did add however that it would be local law enforcement that would investigate murders and not the FBI.

The sister was tracked down on 
Facebook by tech journalist Joel Johnson using information which was 
posted on Reddit but later deleted.

In her response, she wrote to him: 
‘My brother lives in another country, not sure what he does online. It's
an ill-advised prank.

‘I know no one who has overdosed and my brother is a scrawny gamer.

‘I have seen your Twitter/Facebook 
and would appreciate if you wouldn't link anything to me as I'm 
currently applying for higher level positions in my career.

‘As you might imagine, this could 
adversely affect me. I respect your ethics as a reporter doing research 
and wish you luck, but his attempts at internet "points/karma" have 
nothing to do with me.’

By internet Karma she was referring to the goodwill of other users when they approve your comments or posts.

All a hoax: This is the screenshot of the sister's conversation with a reporter where she vows that her brother never killed her abusive boyfriend

Mr Johnson told MailOnline: ‘The 
sister was pretty web savvy and she said she didn’t know what her 
brother had been doing and that she had never known anybody to OD.

‘She said she didn’t want to be in the middle of all her brother’s silly Internet games.’

Mr Johnson posted the information on 
Reddit but was angry to learn he had been made the subject of a Shadow 
Ban, which makes it look to other users like you have been banned, even 
though everything looks normal to you.

He believes the reason is that he was
posting personal information about Reddit users, which is against its 
internal rules, so the moderators appear to have effectively suspended 
his account.

Mr Johnson said this left him in the 
bizarre position that the only way he could investigate the story was to
write about it elsewhere, so posted a comment on Gawker about his 
findings.

The post which started the story was 
put up on Reddit on Saturday night with the title 'Finally have the guts
to say it' to the AdviceAnimals subforum.

The thread linked to the meme known 
as Confession Bear, which usually reserved for innocuous confessions so,
within minutes, Reddit users began commenting on the photo, asking if 
the disclosure was true and if so when it happened.

In now-deleted comments, other users 
began unearthing Naratto's personal details, which were publicly 
available, including his full name, date of birth, occupation and 
employer, location and Facebook, Twitter and Myspace account and then 
began debating whether the authorities should be alerted.

Reddit moderators then removed these details although MailOnline was able to find them still posted elsewhere on the Internet.

They show that that the user, who 
posted under the name Naratto, appears to be 24-years-old and originally
from Coquitlam, British Columbia, which is where he appears to be 
living now.

He says he is living in San Diego but this contrasts with what his sister claims.

MailOnline carried out a search for him in San Diego using his personal information but no match came up.

Naratto has either been in the Navy 
or is still in the Navy and claims in an online profile on Help.com that
he is a Fire Controlman 2nd Class.

Response: Naratto responded just once, pictured, to the stream of comments, which by Tuesday had reached more than 3224, claiming 'some' of the confession was true

Under his hobbies he lists ‘watching movies, smoking pot’, karate, claims to own a snake and says he used to be bipolar.

His favorite film is the 2009 action 
movie Rampage and his favorite song is ‘In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida’ by 1960s 
rockers Iron Butterfly.

In addition to being in the Navy, he 
claims his other job is as a ‘Medicinal Marijuana Bud-Tender’ and in a 
rambling post talks about how he set up a collective to sell it with his
mother.

The post details how his mother fired
him because he ‘f***** up an order’ and asks other users to give him 
advice on whether or not it is his fault.

MailOnline has been unable as yet to 
ascertain if this is true or not or if he was trolling and trying to get
a rise out of others.

The post says: ‘When I asked what was wrong with it she had no answer for me and just told me I was fired.

‘When I told her that the shipment 
arrived after I was off duty and it was the night shift’s 
responsibility, she punched me in the face. At this point I lost my 
temper and kicked a piece of furniture. I barely skuffed the surface, 
the mark came out in a second with a paper towel and googone.

‘But that was the final nail in the 
coffin of me working there. She said I was violent and impulsive… after 
getting punched in the face and fired. I think I controlled myself 
pretty well. I just want to know from an outside point of view if I was 
wrong.

‘p.s. She kicked me out of the 
building and told me to find my own ride home, since my car is broke and
she was my transport. I then had to walk for 5 miles in rain and cold 
with just a thin undershirt (she had taken my work shirt since I was 
fired).

‘Am I wrong in how I behaved? Was I 
responsible for what the other staff had done? Someone please help me on
this cause I’m about to break down.’

Naratto has responded to the row and admitted that his confession was not entirely serious but would not elaborate.

Lightening the mood: Trying to lighten the mood, he posted a follow up meme, pictured, suggesting the confession was a joke

'First and only comment to be made by me,' he wrote.

'I posted this wondering what would 
happen, there is SOME truth behind it, but I'm not saying what was true 
and what wasn't. If I had a dollar for every time someone took me 
seriously on the internet, I would be able to retire from today alone. 
I'm sorry to anyone that I've offended to the point of ruining their 
lives.

'If you want to catch a murder, get 
out of your house, put on some tight and go fight crime. I'm quite done 
with reddit tonight. Back to the shadows of lurking, the world isn't 
quite ready for me.

When his personal information was posted on Reddit, Naratto put another post up.

He wrote: 'EDIT: The reason for this 
post and the admittance it was a joke because people started posting my 
own personal information on there. Not s*** that was in my post history.

'Sure you can find information about 
ME but link me to something that happened is completely different. I 
made a meme about something, and it turned into people revealing my 
PERSONAL INFORMATION. It was quite rude and VERY uncalled for.'

He also posted a second meme stating:
'If you joke about murder on Reddit without a throw away account you're
gonna have a bad time.'

Fueling speculation that the 
confession could be true, he then deleted his Reddit account, as well as
his Facebook and other social media pages.

MailOnline is reaching out to police in San Diego and British Columbia.
