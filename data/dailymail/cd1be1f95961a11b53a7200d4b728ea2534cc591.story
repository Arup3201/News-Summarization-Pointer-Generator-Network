Protection: Harris has been moved to Stafford prison after being bullied by inmates at HMP Bullingdon

Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris has been moved to a 'soft' prison after being bullied by inmates.

The 84-year-old has been transferred to Stafford jail, which has two separate wings for 'vulnerable' sex offenders, from HMP Bullingdon, in Oxfordshire.

He was moved prison following a number of incidents where he was targeted by fellow inmates. 

A source said: 'The other prisoners were keen to take him down a peg or two. He was moved to another prison for his own safety about two weeks ago.'  

In July, the former TV personality was spat at by an inmate during a prison church service which sparked a mass brawl.

Other prisoners verbally abused Harris from the pews of the chapel.

Witnesses claimed the inmate tried to spit on the convicted paedophile but missed and hit another prisoner. 

The incident led to an attack between the two convicts, who began throwing punches and had to be separated by officers.

Harris also angered fellow inmates when he was accused of receiving special treatment after landing the 'plum job' of prison gardener. 

The Australian was paid to look after the vegetable patch and parts of the ground, despite one prisoner saying he had been waiting 12 months for a similar job.

Elsewhere, Harris faced threats from prisoners on his wing for hogging the prison phones. 

The shamed TV star chattered for up to an hour each time on one of the five phones shared between 140 inmates to call his wife Alwen and daughter Bindi. 

It was also reported that Harris had lost a stone since being jailed, as he disliked the taste of prison food. 

Harris, who had previously enjoyed eating curried lobster and roast quail as part of his pre-prison diet, struggled to adjust to prison meals such as tuna salads and low-fat chicken curries.

But more recently, it was claimed Harris had won over some of the prisoners by signing drawings for convicts who queue outside his cell.

However, the artist, who painted an official portrait of the Queen, was banned from painting last week because prison bosses decided his oils pose a fire risk. 

It meant he was forced to use pencils for his sketches instead.

Harris was convicted of 12 indecent assaults on June 30 at Southwark Crown Court by Mr Justice Sweeney - one on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens and a catalogue of abuse of his daughter's friend over 16 years.

During the trial, Harris, a family favourite for decades, was finally unmasked as a predator who was fixated with under-age girls.

Jurors were told how his 16-year campaign of sex abuse against his daughter's friend ‘haunted’ her and made her abandon her dreams as he continued to be adored by millions of fans worldwide.

Passing sentence, Justice Sweeney said: 'You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all. Your reputation now lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame but yourself.' 

His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed, and he faces losing his prestigious CBE.

The performer's multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims.

He was jailed for five years and nine months for the sex abuse, meaning that he is due to serve just under three years for the crimes, which spanned between 1968 and 1986. 

The Prison Service said: 'We don't comment on individuals.'  

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'We would not describe the prison as soft, it is more simply more appropriate for this type of offending.

'The prison is somewhere where they hold this type of offender and so it is easier to have them in one place.'
