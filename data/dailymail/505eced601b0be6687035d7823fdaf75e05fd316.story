These heart-warming photos capture the moment an adorable bear cub is lovingly embraced by his mother after pestering her for attention as the pair prepare for lunch.

The young bear can be seen climbing on top her and playfully nibbling on her ear as they sit in a meadow near Lake Clark in Alaska in July.

The incredible images were taken by British wildlife photographer Kevin Morgans, 28, who claims he decided to sit and watch the bears to see if they would display any interesting behaviour.

He said: 'The cub was biting on his mother's ear hoping to get a reaction, and when the mother finally gave in the pair rolled over into some beautiful light for me to photograph them.

'It was such an amazing moment - I felt so privileged to witness this interaction between the mother and cub.'

Mr Morgans, who is originally from Cheshire, says that from a young age he always loved being outdoors and admiring wildlife.

He added: 'In truth it has only been four years since I picked up my first DSLR camera. It has been a steep learning curve and plenty of mistakes have been made along the way. 

'But my camera has taken me to some magnificent places and there is no better place to improve your photography than out in the field.

'My biggest inspiration is photographing wildlife in harsh environments and this winter I will be spending three weeks on a new project in Norway - photographing musk ox during the winter.'

Bear hug: The cub, obscured from view, wraps his paws around his mother as he playfully attempts to get some attention from her near Lake Clark in Alaska

Success: The sizeable infant seems to win his mother over and gives her a cheeky nibble after she turns around to embrace him

That's enough! The older bear seems to have had enough of the cub's boisterous behaviour and growls at him as he turns his head away

British photographer Kevin Morgans, originally from Cheshire, said 'it was an amazing moment, I felt so privileged to witness this interaction between the mum and cub'

Rough play: He added 'the cub was biting on his mum's ear hoping to get a reaction, and when the mother finally gave in the pair rolled over into some beautiful light'
