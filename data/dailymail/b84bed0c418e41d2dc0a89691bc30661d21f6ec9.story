Foreign doctors who want to work in the UK should be required to get better exam results to ensure patient safety, researchers are urging.

To practise in the UK, doctors currently have to pass exams testing their medical knowledge and English language skills.

But the study concluded that the pass mark is set too low – and insisted that foreign doctors who pass are not up to the same standard as newly-trained doctors in Britain.

Researchers at University College London and the University of Cambridge found the international graduates got substantially lower marks in exams for would-be GPs and physicians.

Foreign doctors must pass an English language test and the General Medical Council's Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board (PLAB) test, designed to ensure that overseas doctors demonstrate the same level of medical knowledge and clinical skills as UK graduates who have completed their first foundation training year.

The researchers compared the results of these two tests to the performance of UK graduates taking exams set by the Royal Colleges of Physicians and the Royal College of General Practitioners.

They said that raising the exam pass mark 'considerably' – by up to 20 per cent – would ensure both sets of doctors were of a similar standard.

But they also warned this would cut the pass rate and could cause a shortage of candidates for the NHS, which is heavily reliant on foreign medical staff.

The number of patients on NHS waiting lists is at its highest for nearly six years.

There are now 2.89million awaiting surgery or other hospital procedures, including nearly 550 who have been waiting for more than a year.

Official figures also show that, for the first time since March 2011, the NHS has missed a crucial target that patients should be treated within 18 weeks.

The health service is meant to ensure that at least 90 per cent are treated within this time but the figure fell to 89.9 per cent in February, meaning that around 400 waited longer.

Labour warned that the NHS was heading back to the 'bad old days' when hundreds of thousands of patients waited up to two years for treatment.

Its health spokesman, Andrew Gwynne, said: 'Under David Cameron, waiting lists for operations are at their longest in years.'

Around one in three doctors registered with the GMC qualified in other countries, with 27 per cent obtaining their medical degree from outside the European Economic Area.

Concerns over the abilities of foreign-trained doctors were brought to the fore by the death of 70-year-old retired engineer David Gray in 2008. He was given ten times the normal dose of diamorphine by German locum Dr Daniel Ubani.

Nigerian-born Dr Ubani had snatched just a few hours of sleep after flying in from Germany to work his first shift for a private out-of-hours firm.

Writing on the medical website bmj.com, the researchers said  the move could create 'severe workforce planning challenges' for the NHS.

But they insisted that raising the standard of the exam was 'fundamental to ensuring the quality of postgraduate medical education and training, the delivery of medical care of the highest quality, and thus ensuring patient safety in the NHS'.

In a separate study, Durham University researchers compared postgraduate performance between international and UK medical graduates – and found that the UK graduates did better in later exams.

Dr Paul Tiffin, a senior lecturer Durham's School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health, said: 'Further research is needed to understand the potential reasons for these differences in performance, and in particular, the possible role that language and culture may play.'

He added: 'There may be better ways of supporting overseas doctors to adjust to UK culture, and that of the health service more quickly.'

Professor John McLachlan, co-director of  the Centre for Medical Education Research at Durham, said: 'It is important to appreciate that from patients' points of view, cultural differences are not absolutes.

'For instance, a doctor from a particular cultural background may be able to provide particularly valuable care to patients from the same background.'
