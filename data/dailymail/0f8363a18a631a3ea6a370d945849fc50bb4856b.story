You have to wonder what went through Wayne Skinner's head - apart from excruciating pain - as he slipped in his home and fell down the stairs, banging his skull on each step as he went. The good news, according to Wayne, a 25-year-old electrician from Derbyshire, is that only one of the baubles in the box he was carrying was damaged. 'One lost a few spikes, but I came off worse than the decorations. I had a headache for days.'

Three years before he had another headache that lasted a week when his father dropped the bracket for a glitter ball on his head. 'I had a bit of a sit down then I carried on decorating.'

Wayne, you see, is not a man easily distracted from the work of adorning his house for the festive season. People come from all over the county to see the light show he puts on, and he insists this year is going to be the best yet.

turning their homes into winter wonderlands at Christmas

The Christmas light display at Dave Edward's house in Croxley Green, Herts. The display contains hundreds of lights, 15 outdoor sockets, three ex-Blackpool displays, a strobe, two lasers, a 4ft snowman and 68 metres of ropelight, and is all computerised and set to music

Dave got the idea after seeing how Americans decorate their homes on a trip to California in the 70s and he was one of the first in England to go to such lengths

At a few weeks short of 80, Dave Edwards, known to locals in his hometown of Watford as Mr Christmas, has been decorating his home since 1978

'I've no idea how much I spend but 
we've got hundreds of lights, 15 outdoor sockets, three ex-Blackpool 
displays, a strobe, two lasers, a 4ft snowman and 68 metres of 
ropelight. It's more of a show than a display. It's all computerised and
 set to music so it looks as though the lights are dancing.'

Wayne
 is one of a growing band of enthusiasts who spend hundreds of pounds 
turning their homes into winter wonderlands at Christmas. Now Channel 
Five is taking a peek inside their bauble-draped homes for a one-off 
show. Unsurprisingly, the men - and it's usually men - for whom 'putting
 up the Christmas lights' requires military planning, extendable ladders
 and hefty electricity bills tend to be pretty colourful characters 
themselves.

Wayne has been 
decorating the home he shares with street cleaner father John and care 
assistant mother Susan since he was 14, but he got the bug when he was 
six months old on a trip to see the Blackpool Illuminations.

Mr Stan Truelove, from Westmarch in Kent, decorates his house every Christmas with thousands of lights and ornaments

'I
 only stopped crying when the pram hood was down. Mum thinks it's 
because I couldn't see the lights with it up!' Now they have lights 
stored in their attic, bedrooms and even on the landing. 'You get used 
to seeing a 6ft Santa on the stairs in summer!' says Wayne.

At
 a few weeks short of 80, Dave Edwards, known to locals in his hometown 
of Watford as Mr Christmas, has been decorating his home since 1978. 
'I'll keep going until I can’t get up the ladder,' chuckles Dave, who's 
made £45,000 for charity over the years. He got the idea after seeing 
how Americans decorate their homes on a trip to California in the 70s 
and he was one of the first in England to go to such lengths.

The incredible light display on Wendy and Malcolm Molloy's home in Finstall, near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire

The Molloy's spend about £900 on electricity in December and about £750 a year on lights. There is a North Pole area with penguins and a Santa section with big sacks of toys

The couple's enthusiasm is infectious and even the neighbours opposite can't raise a complaint. 'Though they have put up blackout blinds,' laughs Malcolm

Worcestershire builder Malcolm, 55, spent much of his childhood in foster homes and never had a proper Christmas until he met Wendy, 53

'We
 just did it for us, my wife and I, to begin with but when people 
started throwing money on the lawn we decided we'd collect for charity. 
Now we get about 700 people at switch-on night.'

But the most poignant of all is the tale of Malcolm and Wendy Molly. Worcestershire builder Malcolm, 55, spent much of his childhood in foster homes and never had a proper Christmas until he met Wendy, 53. 'When I was young Mum was always running away and Dad ran after her, so me and my brother and sisters would get taken into separate foster homes. I only remember two Christmases when we were in our own home, and at foster homes the people never had money for presents,' he says.

It was only when he started dating Wendy and she filled her old Santa sack with presents for him that he realised what he'd been missing. But even she didn't realised just how hooked on Christmas Malcolm would become. 'We spend about £900 on electricity in December and about £750 a year on lights. There's a North Pole area with penguins and a Santa section with big sacks of toys.'

The couple's enthusiasm is infectious and even the neighbours opposite can't raise a complaint. 'Though they have put up blackout blinds,' laughs Malcolm.

In fact a sense of goodwill is evident in the communities where all the light fanatics live. Wayne and his father were persuaded by locals to keep their display when a stand-off with vandals saw John lose a tooth. And Dave Edwards says he couldn't carry on without the neighbours who hand out mince pies and let visitors stand on their lawn.

Plastic Santas and flashing lights may not feature in the traditional Nativity story but it's hard not to conclude that these neighbourly souls embody the true spirit of Christmas.
