Manchester City face Everton in Saturday's late kick-off in the Premier League with Manuel Pellegrini's side looking to move within three points of leaders Chelsea.

After Jose Mourinho's side were beaten 2-1 at St James' Park earlier in the day, reigning champions City will be looking to capitalise by narrowing the gap to their title rivals.

Up against them is an Everton side who are looking for a win to climb the table as they currently lie 11th in the Premier League.

It's all over around the grounds in today's 3pm kick-offs. Not the greatest day for goals with three of the five games ending in 0-0 draws. Not the best of days for Arsenal fans either...

While we wait for kick-off at the Etihad Stadium, why not have a read of Rob Draper's match report from St James' Park earlier today, where league leaders Chelsea were beaten 2-1 by Newcastle.

We're still 45 minutes from kick-off at the Etihad and Dan Ripley will be here to bring you all the action.

At the moment, he's currently locked into the 3pm fixtures with Arsenal 3-2 down at Stoke and Liverpool locked at 0-0 with Sunderland at Anfield in the late stages.

An attacking line-up from Roberto Martinez with Lukaku, Eto'o and Mirallas all starting for the visitors:

Everton: Howard, Baines, Distin, Jagielka, Hibbert, Coleman, Barry, Besic, Mirallas, Eto'o, Lukaku.

Aguero starts up top in front of what looks like a five-man midfield for Manuel Pellegrini's side. Still no Vincent Kompany:

Man City: Hart, Zabaleta, Clichy, Demichelis, Mangala, Fernando, Yaya Toure, Navas, Nasri, Milner, Aguero.

Suddenly we have a title race on again. 

After Chelsea's 2-1 defeat by Newcastle earlier today, champions Manchester City could find themselves just three points off the leaders by the end of today with a win against Everton.

It's good to have you all along, stay tuned for team news from the Etihad.
