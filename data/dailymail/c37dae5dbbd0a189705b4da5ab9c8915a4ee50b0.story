Legal clerk and environmental activist Erin Brockovich - who was famously portrayed by Julia Roberts in a movie about her life - has apologized for her drunken boating arrest last Friday as it's revealed that her blood alcohol content was twice the legal limit.

'At no time was the boat away from the dock and there was no public safety risk,' she said in a statement, denying police claims that she operated the boat in open waters.

'That being said, I take drunk driving very seriously, this was clearly a big mistake. I know better and I am very sorry,' she added. 'After a day in the sun and with 
nothing to eat it appears that a couple of drinks had a greater impact 
than I realized.'

Legal clerk and environmental activist Erin Brockovich has apologized for her drunken boating arrest last Friday

Brockovich, 52,  was booked into jail
around 10 p.m. on Friday after game warden in Lake Mead, Nevada spotted
her struggling with her boat at a marina. Brockovich had been out on the boat with a male companion but was alone when she tried to dock it.

Edwin Lyngar of the Nevada Department 
of Wildlife said her blood alcohol content was over twice the legal 
limit of 0.08 when she was arrested.

'She
was obviously struggling to put the boat in the slip, and if you’ve had
any experience, it’s a simple enough operation,' Lyngar said.

'This incident is an important reminder that boating under the influence is on par with driving under the influence,' he added.

The mother of three, who has an estimated net worth of $42 million, had slurred 
speech and was unsteady on her feet as she tried to dock the boat. She 
failed a sobriety test and was taken to jail, where she was later 
released on a $1,000 bail.

Boating blunder: Brockovich, famous for acting as an advocate for residents of Hinkley, California, against the Pacific Gas and Electricity Company, was recently arrested for DUI

Under Nevada law, a first-time offense of boating while intoxicated is a
misdemeanor that draws fines from $1,000 to $2,000 but no jail time. 
Authorities were unsure whether it was Brockovich's first arrest on the 
charge.

Brockovich, who married her third 
husband, Eric L. Ellis, in 1999, became a worldwide celebrity after the 
2000 Steven Soderbergh film about her life.

As a legal assistant she helped win a 
record $333 million settlement from a power company after dozens of 
people were poisoned by chemicals released into the water supply in the 
California town of Hinkley.

After suffering an injury in an auto accident, Brokovich hired the California law firm Masry and Vititoe to represent her in a civil lawsuit against the other driver. While the firm won her a small settlement, the single mother needed a job to support her family.

The law firm hired Brokovich as a 
file clerk, which is what ultimately launched the former Miss Pacific 
Coast's career in law and public advocacy.

While organizing files for a pro-bono
real estate case, Brokovich uncovered medical records that would lead 
to the largest settlement ever paid out in a direct action lawsuit in 
U.S. history.

Brokovich's investigation found that 
the Pacific Gas and Electric company had been poisoning Hinkley 
residents for more than 30 years.

Between 1952 and 1966, the company 
used the chemical hexavalent chromium (often referred to as Cr-6) to 
fight corrosion in the cooling tower in the Hinkley compressor, which 
was part of a natural gas pipeline connecting much of northern 
California to the San Francisco Bay area.

The waste water dissolved the Cr-6 and it ended up in unlined ponds near the cooling tower.

The Cr-6 then found its way into the groundwater, contaminating a two-by-one-mile area around the plant.

Because of Brokovich's research, more than 600 Hinklley residents shared the giant $333 million settlement.

For her work, Brokovich was given a $2 million bonus.

Julia Roberts won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Brockovich in the self-titled movie about the case.

Brokovich and Masry then became the 
face of environmental litigation and went on to file several lawsuits 
against various corporations for pollution issues.

Brockovich was released from jail after posting $1,000 bail

Since the film, Brockovich has become a high profile campaigner and TV star with her own series, 'Final Justice.'

Just last year, Brockovich was back 
on the big screen in the documentary 'Last Call at the Oasis,' which 
explores challenges related to the planet's dwindling and increasingly 
polluted water supply.
