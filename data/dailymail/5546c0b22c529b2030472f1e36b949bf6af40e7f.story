Caution: Vince Cable urged universities to 'think twice' about vice-chancellors' pay

Vince Cable has urged universities to ‘think twice’ about vice-chancellors’ pay after it emerged that their average earnings topped £260,000 last year.

The Business Secretary said large pay rises would be ‘hard to swallow’ when many institutions were short of funding.

Figures obtained from 150 institutions by the University and College Union under the Freedom of Information Act show the average overall salary package for university heads in 2013/14 was £260,290.

A total of 18 vice-chancellors saw their pay rise by more than 10 per cent, the lecturers’ union calculated.

The best paid was the former vice-chancellor of Nottingham Trent University, Professor Neil Gorman, who pocketed £623,000 with bonuses accrued over the past five years.

The UCU also found the average expenditure on flights for university leaders was £9,705, with many travelling first or business class. The average for hotel accommodation was £3,202 and personal expenses £3,112.

Mr Cable said yesterday: ‘At a time when most university staff are seeing modest wage increases, if any at all, news of these large pay rises for university bosses will be hard to swallow. It would be wise for the sector to think twice before increasing vice-chancellors’ salaries.’

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Soaraway pay at the top has been matched by zero-hours contracts and big real-wage falls for staff across higher education.’

Last year, ministers said they had serious concerns about the ‘substantial upward drift’ of salaries and that university leaders should show ‘much greater restraint’. 

UK universities are independent institutions but they receive public grants, and students receive government loans to pay tuition fees.

UCU asked 155 UK universities and colleges a series of questions about vice-chancellors’ pay packages, including benefits and pensions, as well as money spent on air fares, hotel accommodation and personal expenses, for the year ending July 31 last year.

Around 16 per cent- 24 institutions - did not respond or cited exemptions and did not release the requested information.

The findings show that the average overall salary package for university heads in 2013/14 was £260,290 based on data from 150 institutions. 

The average expenditure on flights for university leaders, with information from 128 universities, was £9,705.75.

The most was spent by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), which paid out £59,811.14 on flights for director Professor Craig Calhoun.

Overall just over two-thirds of air fares were for first or business class, UCU said, according to data from 114 universities.

The average spend on hotel accommodation during 2013/14 was £3,202.05, based on data from 122 institutions. The most was spent by Glasgow Caledonian University for Professor Pamela Gillies at £27,271.13.

The average received by vice-chancellors in personal expenses was £3,112.61, according to information gathered from 125 universities.

The highest amount - £33,526 - was given to Professor Gavin Henderson of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.

Richard Bullock, chairman of Nottingham Trent University’s board of governors, said: ‘Former vice-chancellor Professor Neil Gorman received a 2 per cent salary pay rise in his final year as vice-chancellor.

‘The additional monies reported in this year’s financial accounts were paid under a scheme that was instigated in 2008 to operate over a five-year period. 

'This scheme was put in place by the board following independent, external advice, at a critical time in the university’s strategic development which required continuity of leadership. 

'The board were keen to retain Professor Gorman for this five-year period following a very successful initial five years.’

He added that monies accrued annually were subject to meeting clear terms, with accruals declared each year.

An LSE spokesman said: ‘A key part of the director’s role at LSE is to maintain the array of international relationships and establish new links with universities, businesses and non-governmental organisations around the world. 

'Inevitably this involves a significant amount of international travel. None of this travel is in first class.’

A Glasgow Caledonian spokeswoman said: ‘GCU is the first Scottish university to open a campus in London and it established the UK’s first campus in New York in 2013/14, with further key partnerships in Bangladesh, Oman and South Africa.

‘This has inevitably required extended trips to our overseas locations and having increased costs. The university is transparent about expenses incurred.’
