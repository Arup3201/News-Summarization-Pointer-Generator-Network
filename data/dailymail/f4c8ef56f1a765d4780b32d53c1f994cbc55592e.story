Two teenagers have been found guilty of stabbing a young father to death at a birthday party after he intervened in a fight to protect his friend.

Connor Barrett, 20, was stabbed in the chest and back while at a party in Hemsby, Norfolk, after a large group of uninvited guests turned up and began causing trouble.

Jesse Quaye, 18, and a 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were found guilty of murdering Mr Barrett, who had a young son, at Norwich Crown Court today.

Mr Barrett's mother, grandmother and aunt issued a statement saying: 'Today we received some justice for Connor.

'It has not brought us any pleasure, just relief to know that horrific part of our lives is coming to a close.

'Our life sentence began at 12.25am on May 11 and we will never have the opportunity of parole. Our grief will remain with us all forever.'

Mr Barrett, from Great Yarmouth, had been DJ-ing at the 21st birthday part when a large group, who had seen the event posted on social media, arrived.

Anthony McLean, 41, was found guilty of helping Quaye to avoid justice by driving him to London in the hours after the attack

A fight broke out and Mr Barrett intervened to try and protect a friend when he was stabbed. Police were called and found him with serious injuries to his chest and back. He died later in hospital.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Paul Durham described Mr Barrett as a 'popular lad'.

He added: 'He could not have foreseen the end result when he went to protect one of his friends on what was meant to be a happy occasion.

'This is a genuinely appalling way to resolve any situation and has resulted in a young man's life being cut short with untold pain and grief for his family and friends.

'His murder sent shockwaves through the small and close knit community and police received overwhelming support from local people which I have, no doubt, has helped to bring his killers to justice today.'

Quaye, 18, from Cobholm, and the 15-year-old from Great Yarmouth were convicted after a four-week trial. 

Both were found guilty of actual bodily harm to Ricky Halliday, a fellow party-goer, and will also be sentenced for possessing offensive weapons.

A third man, Anthony McLean, 41, also from Great Yarmouth, was found guilty of assisting Quaye to evade justice by driving him to London in the hours after the attack.

All were remanded in custody to return for sentencing on January 16.
