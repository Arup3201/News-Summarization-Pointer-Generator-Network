She may have starred as Harry Potter's schoolgirl sidekick in all seven of the Potter films. But there was barely a hint of Hermione Granger in evidence today as Madame Tussauds unveiled a waxwork of Emma Watson.

Emma, who grew up on film after landing a role as Harry Potter's best friend in the big screen adaptation of JK Rowling's popular literary series, was honoured today with a statue of her likeness in the internationally renowned museum.

Captured sitting demurely on a sofa with one leg crossed and her hand resting in her lap, she joins a long line of famous faces to be initiated into the collection at the London tourist attraction, where the like of Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet and, of course, the Royals can also be visited by guests.

Madame Tussauds London reveals Emma Watson's new wax figure dressed Elie Saab

Good likeness? Emma is captured sitting with her legs crossed and her hand on her knee, gazing off into the distance

The wax work is dressed in an outfit designed by Elie Saab: a glamorous, midnight blue cocktail dress with a deep sweetheart neckline, the bodice embellished with beading, which the actress wowed the crowds in at a red carpet 
event in Hong Kong 16 months ago.

A pair of black court shoes and a stunning short diamond necklace and statement ring complete the look.

Emma's expressive face is immortalised in a wistful expression, gazing off into the distance with a slight smile on her lips.

Her hair is swept up in an elegant, grown-up style, which seems to highlight the actress's journey since the end of the Harry Potter films in 2011.

The 22-year-old, who has gone on to appear in films such as The Perks Of Being A Wallflower and My Week With Marilyn, is seated on a chaise longue to allow fans to sit next to her.Â

Nicole Fenner of Tussauds said: 'Emma is the perfect addition and we're very lucky to add her to our A-list line up.

'She's a true English rose known and loved by millions of film and fashion fans around the world.'

Watson's co-star Daniel Radcliffe, who played Harry Potter himself in all the films, was immortalised in wax in 2007.

Her figure is on display from today.
