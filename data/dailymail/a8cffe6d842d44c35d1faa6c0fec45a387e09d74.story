England's Joe Root has continued his surge up the batsmen's rankings after breaking into the top 10 for the first time.

The Yorkshireman is England's highest-ranked batsman and he now sits in ninth place following his 149 not out in London over the weekend.

His innings was the fifth time he had passed 50 in the series, one in every match to replicate a feat achieved previously by only two Englishmen.
