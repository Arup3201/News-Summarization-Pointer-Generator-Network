It's an age-old dilemma that almost every young man will sometime have to face- just how to go about asking that special somebody for a first date and how to behave to stand a chance of a second.

But for chaps in the 1949 everything was made so simple with this cringe-worthy educational video that provides all the advice they might need to guarantee a swell time.

The vintage footage from follows the trial and tribulations of young 'Woody' Woodrow who's just landed himself a hot ticket to the Hi-Teen Carnival - but just who should he take?

First date jitters: But young Woody Woodrow's night out with Anne goes off without a hitch thanks to the tips in this hilarious dating video from the 1949

Good looking Janice perhaps? Not a good idea the video warns, 'She always acts so bored - she'd make a fellow feel awkward and inferior.'

And spare a thought for poor Betty who is regarded as another wrong-un because while she may not act superior, she wouldn't be any fun either.

Hot ticket: The Hi-Teen Carnival offers good wholesome fun

So instead Woody plumps for 'good-time' Anne - but how should he ask her, and, gulp, what if she refused?

Luckily for Woody there's plenty of advice on hand - from Dad 'look your best son, a first date is mighty important' and mom 'any girl who can't be ready on time for a date isn't good enough for my boy.'

But Woody's real inspiration comes from smooth-talking brother Ed: 'Be your natural talkative old self and remember - flowers for a prom or very special party otherwise you don't need to.'

And there are tips for girls too with Anne telling little sister Judy 'The important think about a date is to have a good time, you don't need to spend a lot of money to do that.

'Just enjoy what you're doing whether its movies or parties or anything and you leave your boyfriend with enough money so he'll ask you again.'

Poor choice: Janice, left, is good looking but 'she'd make a fellow feel awkward and inferior' while Betty, right, is 'not superior' but wouldn't be that much fun either, the video warns

Anne tells little sister Judy that the important thing about a date is to 'have a good time'

And there are pearls of wisdom on hand from mom and dad too who recount the tales of their first dates

Thanks to all the helpful advice Woody and 
Anne's first date goes off without a hitch - and they get to enjoy a 
range of wholesome activities at the carnival including a game of darts 
to having their fortunes told plus a riveting slide show.

And
when it comes to saying goodnight - lunging in for a quick snog is a 
definite no no. Indeed any hanky-panky is strictly off limits just say 
thank you because 'a girl likes to know you've had a good time'.

Follow these golden rules fellas, and perhaps like Woody, you'll get to walk home whistling with a second date in the bag.
