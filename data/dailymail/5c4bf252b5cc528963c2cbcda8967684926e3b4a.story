Serena Williams has claimed her words were misconstrued after an interview was published in Rolling Stone magazine in which she was quoted as suggesting the 16-year-old victim in a rape case in the US was asking to be assaulted.

In the article, the world No 1 was quoted as saying the victim 'shouldn't have put herself in that position' and described her as 'lucky.'

But after the article sparked an intense backlash, Williams released a statement on her website in which she wrote she was 'deeply sorry for what was written'.

Apology: Serena Williams had sparked an intense backlash after she appeared to make an astonishing indictment of the victim in the Steubenville rape case

Outrage: Serena Williams, pictured on Tuesday at Burberry Menswear Spring/Summer 2014 fashion show in London, has sparked outrage with her controversial comments

'Do you think it was fair, what they got? They did something stupid, but I don't know,' the article read. 'I'm not blaming the girl, but if you're a 16-year-old and you're drunk
like that, your parents should teach you—don't take drinks from other 
people.'

'She's 16, why was she that drunk where she doesn't remember? It could have been much worse. She's lucky. Obviously I don't know, maybe she wasn't a virgin, but she shouldn't have put herself in that position, unless they slipped her something, then that's different.'

High school American football players Trent Mays and Ma'Lik Richmond were each sentenced to a year in juvenile detention in March for raping the intoxicated teen in Steubenville, Ohio.

The two friends were caught after other students who watched the assault laughed and joked about the horrific crime in an online video.

'What happened in Steubenville was a real shock for me. I was deeply saddened. For someone to be raped, and at only sixteen, is such a horrible tragedy! For both families involved – that of the rape victim and of the accused. I am currently reaching out to the girl’s family to let her know that I am deeply sorry for what was written in the Rolling Stone article. What was written – what I supposedly said – is insensitive and hurtful, and I by no means would say or insinuate that she was at all to blame.

I have fought all of my career for women’s equality, women’s equal rights, respect in their fields – anything I could do to support women I have done. My prayers and support always goes out to the rape victim. In this case, most especially, to an innocent sixteen year old child.'
