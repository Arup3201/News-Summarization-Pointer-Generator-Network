The sport of darts is probably undergoing its biggest transformation at the elite level in more than two decades. Yet one thing always seems to be constant: Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor remaining in the hunt for the world crown.

The 2015 William Hill PDC world darts championship, which reaches the quarter-final stage on Thursday evening, could mark the watershed moment that England’s dominance of the arrows comes to an end.

Of the eight quarter-finalists, only two — Taylor and reigning BDO world champion Stephen Bunting — are English. The remaining six consist of three Dutchmen, including defending champion Michael van Gerwen, and three Scots.

A changing of the guard seems to be underway. To put this all into context, this is the fewest number of Englishmen since three made the last eight in 2009. Between 1998-2000 and 2004-06, the last eight comprised completely of home-grown throwers.

One man who has been there throughout — and still continues to deliver — is Taylor, who plays Dutchman Vincent van der Voort on Friday evening in his record 20th quarter-final appearance at the PDC worlds.

The 16-time world champion, who survived a tough third-round examination by Belgian Kim Huybrechts on Tuesday, reckons he enters the New Year, at 54 years old, playing as good as ever.

‘The experience I have, the talent I have, I’m only going to get better,’ he said. ‘I’m practising better, I’m improving, my darts are better and I’m going to get better — trust me.

Stephen Bunting, the reigning BDO world champion, is the only other Englishman in the last eight 

'I’m not going to bow down to anybody. I mean that in all sincerity. I’m improving. Age will not weary me — not for the next three years anyway.

‘The standards are now are higher compared to 10 years ago. Players are hungrier, more aggressive. I’ve had to adapt. These young kids are playing week-in, week-out. They have so much energy, pounding away, they don’t fear anyone.

‘My victory over Kim was massive. That could win me the world championship — the rest of the field will be going “oh s***” because I’m still in.’

No 1 seed Van Gerwen plays Robert Thornton in the last eight on Thursday night. Then, there is a belated Hogmanay present as two popular Scots, Peter Wright and Gary Anderson, take to the Ally Pally oche.
