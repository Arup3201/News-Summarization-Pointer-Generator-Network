Two cash-strapped farmers have secured a stable income after converting a battered old horsebox into a £100-a-night hotel.

Paul and Anne Ormond, of Banbury, Oxfordshire, spent three months turning a 1974 Bedford TK they bought on eBay into a glamorous camping destination.

They installed a double bedroom above the driver's cab and fitted a sofa, woodburner and antique furniture in the back.

The battered old horsebox was bought on eBay - now it's a £100-a-night 'hotel'

The completed van is now parked in a corner of their 250-acre farm and boasts stunning views over the Oxfordshire countryside.

Paul, 40, and Anne, 39, rent the van as a romantic getaway for £100 per night and have already hosted a number of soap stars.

'We thought that a horsebox would make a really unique place to stay and it's nice to see people using our land,' said Paul

'It may be small, but it can sleep four quite easily, and there's plenty room. There's even a little fireplace, which really ties the room together.

There's even a fireplace in the converted horsebox - the view from the table outside is stunning

There is a small dining table in the converted horsebox, a traditional sideboard unit and the sofa bed sleeps an additional two guests

'I've always been a bit handy with tools and the views are just so lovely that we thought we would be daft not to get involved with a bit of "glamping".'

Despite its tiny proportions, the living area boasts a small dining table, a traditional sideboard unit and a sofa bed which can sleep an additional two guests.

Outside there is a small decking area where guests can enjoy the views and a composting toilet and shower.

Paul and Anne, who have three children, also have a converted shepherd's hut and a traditional gypsy caravan which they use for holiday lets.

The van is parked in a corner of their 250-acre farm in Oxfordshire with most of the land rented to an agricultural company

The rest of their land is rented to an agricultural company and they have one acre for themselves, which they use to house Tom the family pet ram.

'We have 250 acres, but the going rate for renting agricultural land is only £60 a year,' said Paul. 'That's not a lot of money when you think about it, so we've had to be a bit creative.

'We’ve had a few actors from Corrie and Emmerdale come and stay, and they seemed to have a great time.

'We also had an actor from Hustle, who said it was one of the best night’s sleep they have ever had.'
