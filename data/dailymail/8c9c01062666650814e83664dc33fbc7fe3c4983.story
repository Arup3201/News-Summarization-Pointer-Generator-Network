Nicholas Brandram, 31, a descendant of Queen Victoria, crashed into a cyclist on his Harley Davidson but did not stop, a court heard

Queen Victoria's great-great-great grandson crashed his Harley Davidson motorbike into a cyclist outside London’s Hyde Park and drove off without stopping.

Nicholas Brandram, who is grandson of Princess Katherine of Greece, struck cyclist Martha Franklin as he drove around Hyde Park Corner earlier this year.

The back wheel of Miss Franklin's bicycle was damaged after the collision with the 1948 Harley Davidson being ridden by Brandram, 31, a decorated former British Army Captain who has served in Iraq, Bosnia, and Afghanistan.

City of London Magistrates' Court heard that Brandram, who is now a stockbroker living in Fulham, south-west London, did not stop to see if she was hurt or exchange his details after the incident on March 6.

Prosecutor Kerry McNulty said: 'Mr Brandram was driving his Harley Davidson motorcycle on the Hyde Park Corner giratory when he collided with a cyclist.

'Her back wheel was damaged and I have no injuries caused. Mr Brandram then left the scene without exchanging details.’

Brandram, who represented himself, told the court he drove away from the scene because he was unaware he had collided with Ms Franklin.

He told magistrates of his glittering military career and added that he was an ‘upstanding member of society.’

'I remember an incident while on my motorbike in the area described by the prosecutor and I remember a big group of cyclists in traffic,’ he said.

'I had right of way as the zebra crossing was 60 metres away - I kept going when one of the cyclists came ridiculously close to me.

'The claim is that I damaged their back wheel but I don't understand how they wouldn't have fallen off and me as well.

'I provided first aid before to someone who has had an epileptic fit so I would have stopped if I’d have known. If I’ve caused damage I take full responsibility for that.'

Hyde Park Corner: Bartram was riding his 1948 1200cc Harley Davidson when he collided with the cyclist

Brandram’s 1200cc Harley Davidson is large enough to knock a cyclist over at five miles an hour, the court was told.

He told the court: 'I ride a bicycle myself and realise the risks. I’m an upstanding member of society and have recently resigned as a member of the British Army and have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

'I have a very loud bike so it's not impossible I collided with her without me realising it. At the same time, with such a big bike I don’t know how I didn't feel the collision.'

Brandram was given five penalty points on his licence, a £200 fine, and ordered to pay £105 compensation after admitting driving without due care and attention and failing to stop after a road accident.

Leaving court he thanked the magistrates and indicated he would pay his fine immediately.

Brandram, now a manager at Killik & Co stockbrokers, was awarded a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal during his distant relative's celebrations last year.

His grandmother, Princess Katherine, was Queen Victoria's great-granddaughter, a distant relative of Prince Philip, and the daughter of King Constantine I who ruled Greece between 1913 and 1922.
