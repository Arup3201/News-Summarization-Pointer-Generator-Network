A former Tory Minister who is now a key adviser to Boris Johnson has branded the Government sexist after it said adverts for top public sector jobs should be dumbed down to encourage women applicants.

Ex-Treasury Minister Angela Knight attacked the ‘action plan’ issued by the Cabinet Office which says public sector bodies should be ‘simplifying adverts and using language which will encourage candidates’.

The document adds: ‘Job adverts and specifications [should] use plain English and avoid jargon to appeal to the widest field of applicants.’

Ex-Treasury Minister Angela Knight attacked the 'action plan' issued by the Cabinet Office which says public sector bodies should be 'simplifying adverts and using language which will encourage candidates'

Mrs Knight, who has positions in both public and private sector boardrooms, said: ‘I am all in favour of equal opportunities and there is certainly some evidence from the City that women on boards improve company performance.

‘But I don’t think things need to be made simple just so women can get their heads around things. I think organisations should use plain English to attract the right candidates regardless of gender.’

Mrs Knight, 63, sits on the board of Transport for London, a public body which Mr Johnson chairs.

She is also chief executive of Energy UK, the industry body for Britain’s biggest power firms.

Mrs Knight added: ‘None of my jobs have been traditionally “female”, so I can honestly say it makes no difference to me  if my colleagues are male or female. In the end, it’s ability that counts.’

Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes, also criticised the plan and asked for the document to be reworded.

The guidelines have been published by the Centre for Public Appointments (CPA). Its job is to meet the Government’s target of ensuring that half of all senior posts within Government and public sector organisations are filled by women by 2015.

But despite the criticism from Mrs Knight and Ms Wollaston, some female business leaders support the action plan.

The document adds: 'Job adverts and specifications [should] use plain English and avoid jargon to appeal to the widest field of applicants'

Fiona Hathorn, of independent pressure group Women On Board, said: ‘Top women are being put off when it comes to applying for roles by job advertisements laden with historic public sector jargon.’

The CPA works with the Commissioner for Public Appointments to encourage more women in boardrooms.

Commissioner Sir David Normington’s report for 2012-13 paints a rather bleak picture  of public sector appointments for women. In 2001, 39 per cent of appointments were made to women. But in 2012-13, that figure had dropped to 35.6 per cent.

The Cabinet Office’s own figures for 2012-13, show that most Government departments have failed to reach the equality target.

Departments such as the Ministry of Defence had women filling only 17 per cent of vacancies, while the Department for Transport fared even worse at 16 per cent.

The Cabinet Office last night denied its action plan was patronising towards women.

It said: ‘As part of our wider work to reform Whitehall, we want job advertisements to be clear and free of jargon.

'This is good practice in business. It is simply not true to suggest we are dumbing down for women.’
