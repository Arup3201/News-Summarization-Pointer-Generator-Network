A record-breaking crowd at Wembley have been left thrilled this evening after Team GB's women footballers beat the tournament favourites Brazil.

The home side got off to the best possible start with Arsenal-defender Steph Houghton scoring with less than two minutes gone, sending the huge crowd of 70,584 wild.

And despite Kelly Smith having a second half penalty saved by the Brazilian goalkeeper, Team GB maintained the lead to secure a famous victory.

The British players celebrate Steph Houghton's second minute goal, which set them on their way to a 1-0 victory over Brazil at Wembley last night

There were just 92 seconds on the clock when Arsenal player Houghton rounded the Brazilian goalkeeper and finished from a difficult angle

The 1-0 win over tournament favourites Brazil delighted the crowd of 70,584 inside Wembley Stadium - a record for a women's football match in Britain

The win means Hope Powell's side have 
topped their group without losing a game and will face Canada in the 
quarter-final in Coventry on Friday.

The result is  arguably the finest in the history of British women's football.

Although there have been more significant achievements, FA officials privately conceded that against such formidable 
opposition, in front of a record  crowd, there has been no
better evening.

BBC commentator Guy Mowbray was left 
aghast at the huge crowd, saying this Olympic Games could take women's 
football to a 'whole new level'.

There was an incredible atmosphere at 
Wembley with more than 70,000 tickets sold before kick-off.

With GB leading 1-0 at half-time, they had a brilliant opportunity to go 2-0 up after being awarded a penalty with half an hour to go. But Kelly Smith's penalty was saved by the Brazilian keeper.

The previous highest crowd at a women's match in England is recorded as 53,000 for an exhibition match between Preston-based Dick Kerr Ladies, a famous touring side of the age, and St Helens Ladies, at Goodison Park, Liverpool on Boxing Day 1920.

The national record for a women's 
international is 29,092 for a European Championship match with Finland 
at the City of Manchester Stadium in 2005.

But the crowd did not surpass the Olympic record of 76,489 from the Atlanta Games in 1996.

The British team - in their first Olympics - have made a flawless start with a 1-0 success over New Zealand and a 3-0 victory over Cameroon.

Speaking before the match, England captain Faye White said Britain could take
it a little easier with qualification already in the bag.

She told Sportsmail: 'I think this is actually bigger than the first game [against New Zealand].

'Playing Brazil, even with the players they have, the girls can relax because they've qualified for the quarter-finals, but they can go out there and show how good they are.

'It feels like the way England approached a friendly against the USA in 2011. Sometimes you can sense something is going to happen.

'We didn't go out there with fear and we beat the No 1 team 2-1, our first win against the States for 22 years.'

The enormous popular support on display at Wembley tonight demonstrates the growth of women's football in recent years.

A successful England women's team - they have reached the knockout stages of their last three international tournaments - and now Great Britain side has inspired more and more people to watch and play the game.

With the launch of the summer Women's Super League last year adding to the boom, the Football Association estimates 1.38m women and girls are taking part across the country.

Beating Brazil would only fuel the interest in GB, who had the honour of kicking-off the London Games in their first match and have audiences with Prince William and David Beckham in the last few days.

'I think they combed their hair a thousands times,' said coach Powell. 'They were absolutely made up. David had sent them a few e-mails of good wishes before, which I passed on to the girls, although I'm not sure they believed me.

'Then to actually meet him and the Prince was fantastic. We were trying to pull them away from people who wanted to take their photos.

'It is great for them. They are enjoying the adulation - and why not? They manage themselves very well.'
