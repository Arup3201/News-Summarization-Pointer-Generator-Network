Patients will be able to see their family doctors in the evenings and at weekends under radical new plans to transform surgery opening hours and improve patient care.

The Prime Minister is poised to unveil £50 million of funding making the money available to GPs so they can open their doors seven days a week.

GPs in 1,000 practices in England will receive extra funding to reorganise their services to enable surgeries to open from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week.

The Challenge Fund, which will be launched tomorrow, is expected to include provisions for GPs to carry out patient consultations via video-link, secure email and telephone.

The Prime Minister is poised to unveil £50 million in funding for GPs across England, to allow them to open their doors in evenings and at weekends

Health Minister Norman Lamb, told The
 Telegraph it is vital that doctors embrace new technology to help improve services for patients.

He said: 'It’s
 very difficult for people with busy lives to get appointments with GPs 
so let’s just get smarter with the use of technology.

'In
 every other aspect of our lives we are using technology to communicate.
 We have got to get into this in a big way in health and care.

'It
 has transformed the efficiency of many other industries and sectors and
 I think it can do the same and provide more responsive care for busy 
people.'

He said for those patients with something they just need 'checking out' taking time off work to try and get an appointment can become a 'nightmare'.

Instead, Mr Lamb said GPs should have the ability to email their patients to offer a quick response, saving the need for the patient to take up a clinic slot.

It is hoped the moves will free up doctors to spend more time with elderly patients, who often have complex conditions, which require longer than the standard 10 minutes allotted to each appointment.

Ministers believe the reform will end the inconvenience millions of workers face trying to book an appointment with a doctor.

And it is hoped GPs will have longer to spend with frail and elderly patients.

The Challenge Fund, which will be launched tomorrow, will provide extra money to allow GPs to reorganise their servicesto enable practices to open from 8am to 8pm seven days a week. The reform package is also expected to include measures for GPs to email patients, who have concerns over minor ailments

Those over the age of 75 will be allocated a named doctor, who will take charge of their treatment.

More elderly patients will be treated in the comfort of their own homes. Some will be given iPads and other devices to send information and data to their doctors, to help continually monitor their condition.

Under the plans it is expected that groups of GPs practices will join together to form networks, to share the workload of covering clinics at evenings and weekends.

 every other aspect of our lives we are using technology to communicate.
 We have got to get into this in a big way in health and care'

The reform is vital as a means of easing the burden on hospital A&E departments across the country buckling under the pressure of millions of patients walking through their doors.

In recent years patients have swamped emergency units, not knowing where else to turn when surgeries close.

inadequate out-of-hours health services have knocked patient confidence in the system, resulting in people with minor ailments flooding to accident and emergency departments.

Four million more patients visited A&E last year, compared with a decade ago.

NHS figures show millions of patients wait a week or more for an appointment with their GPs.

Health ministers said they want to 
restore the 'best traditions of family doctors', to boost services for 
patients, particularly the elderly.

Prime
 Minister David Cameron first revealed the Government's plans to extend 
surgery opening hours at last October's Conservative Party conference.

New services will be offered to all patients over the age of 75, with the reforms dictating each patient that falls into that category must have a named doctor co-coordinating their care

He said: 'Millions of people find it hard to get an appointment to see their GP at a time that fits in with their work and family life.

'We want to support GPs, to modernise their services so they can see patients from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week.

'We also want greater flexibility, so people can speak to their family doctor on the phone, send them an email or even speak to them on Skype,' he added.

Changes to GPs contracts, which came into effect this month, now dictate that all patients over the age of 75 will have a named doctor responsible for their care.

The elderly people's charity Age UK welcomed the reform.

Caroline Abrahams from the charity said the measures represent an 'important and very welcome step' towards better care for older people.

But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, Chair of the British Medical Association's General Practitioner Committee, urged caution, warning inadequate funding could undermine lasting change.
