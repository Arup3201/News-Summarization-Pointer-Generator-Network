Ed Miliband was met with stony silence by union leaders yesterday, even after dropping plans to dilute their infamous block vote within the Labour Party.

Most of his attempt to repair his battered relationship with union barons was met with silence or unenthusiastic applause.

And the biggest cheer of the day came from the head of the Public and Commercial Services union, who demanded to know whether he backed the coalition's austerity programme.

Pressure: Labour leader Ed Miliband told the Trades Union Congress in Bournemouth that unions had an important part to play in his party

Grilling: Mr Miliband took questions, with TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady looking on

The Labour leader, who owes his job to union voting power, used his speech to argue they are not ‘the enemy within’ and lauded their 6.5million members as ‘the people who make Britain what it is’.

But he acknowledged that his party reforms could mean as few as one in ten union members who currently contribute to Labour coffers will do so in future.

The changes will ensure members have to specifically opt in for their fees to go to the party.

Union leaders lambasted the plans at the weekend, saying Mr Miliband was a ‘schoolboy’ who lives in ‘cloud cuckoo land’. 

Addressing
the TUC conference in Bournemouth today, Mr Miliband launched a 
trenchant defence of trade unionism, rejecting Margaret Thatcher’s 
famous description of parts of the movement as enemies.

But taking questions he faced hostility from public sector workers unhappy at spending cuts designed to cut the nation's debts.

Janice Godrich, president of the Public and Commercial Services union which has staged several strikes opposing austerity, used a question and answer session to tackle the Labour leader.

She told Mr Miliband: 'Ed Balls says this is the wrong sort of recovery, yet you're committed to the Tories' spending plans. You say the next election will be about living standards; but you're committed to the public sector pay cap.

'Your policies seem contradictory and they're confusing people. Can we get a clear answer: are you for or against austerity?'

After appearing taken aback, the Labour leader said: 'We are not in favour of austerity.'

But he then risked angering the unions by admitting that Labour would stick to Tory spending limits in order to appear 'credible'.

Speaking afterwards Ms Godrich said: 'Austerity isn't working, our members know that and people up and down the country know it.

'It is incredibly disappointing that, in front of an audience of delegates representing more than six million workers, Ed Miliband failed to offer the alternative people so desperately want and need.'

In his speech Mr Miliband accused David Cameron of devaluing millions of ordinary workers through his attacks on the unions.

‘We
have a Prime Minister who writes you and your members off,’ he said. 
‘Who doesn’t just write you off, but oozes contempt for you from every 
pore. What does he say about you? He says your members are a threat to 
our economy. Back to the enemy within.

‘Six and a half million people in  
Britain. Who teach our children, who look after the sick, who care for 
the elderly, who build our homes, who keep our shops open morning, noon 
and night. They’re not the enemy within. They’re the people who make 
Britain what it is.

Finishing touches: Mr Miliband drafted his speech on the train to Bournemouth

‘How dare he? How dare he insult people, members of trade unions, as he does? How dare he write off whole sections of our society?

‘One Nation Conservatives, would be 
turning in their graves if they could hear the nasty, divisive, 
small-minded rhetoric of the leader of their once great party.

'We know from recent experience what happens to political leaders who write off whole sections of a country.

‘That’s
what Mitt Romney did when he talked about the 47 per cent of people who
would never vote for him. And look what happened to him.’

Under
the current system, union members automatically pay an annual fee of £3
to the Labour party unless they specifically opt out – swelling party 
funds by millions of pounds a year.

Mr Miliband has unveiled plans to force trade unionists to actively opt in to the funding of Labour, with the reward that they will become full party members.

He told delegates he believes his changes could see his party’s membership increase by 300,000 – a figure critics say will make him a hostage to fortune if it does not come about.

But the target number is far fewer than the three million union members who  currently contribute to Labour coffers because they have not opted out.

Labour is likely to head off the threat of a huge loss of funds by charging those who opt in more than the current £3 a year.

Critics say the reforms could  actually strengthen the unions, because it could see them hanging on to more money designed for political campaigning.

Mr Miliband said: ‘It will be a 
massive challenge for the Labour Party to reach out to your members in a
way that we have not done for many years and persuade them to be part 
of what we do.

‘And, like anything that is hard, it is a risk. But the bigger risk is just saying let’s do it as we have always done it.’

Chuka
Umunna, who is Labour’s business spokesman, said it was important to 
‘take the big money out of politics’ even if it hit the party’s 
finances.

But backbencher Ian Lavery said Labour faced ruin and meltdown as a result of the ‘ill thought through’ reforms.

Yesterday
Len McCluskey, general secretary of the powerful Unite union, called on
Mr Miliband to be even stronger in his defence of union links.

‘Trade unions
have always been a force for good in our society,’ he told a fringe 
event at the conference. Instead of attacking, people should look to try
and unite the nation.’

n Mugs celebrating the death in April of Lady Thatcher are on sale at the TUC conference.

Bearing
the legend ‘I Still Hate Thatcher’, they are available alongside 
T-shirts and mugs with the slogan ‘Tories are Lower than Vermin’.

Conservative politicians said the merchandise highlighted the nasty side of the Left.

Conor Burns, MP for Bournemouth West, said: ‘She said they couldn’t forgive her because she won and they lost. She was right.’

Unions and Left-wing campaign groups are planning a national day of strikes and civil disobedience on Bonfire Night as part of their campaign against the Government’s austerity programme.

Yesterday TUC delegates approved the call for unions to co-ordinate a programme of strikes.

The union-backed People’s Assembly had already organised a protest, which was planned to take place on November 5.

However this is now set to be directly supported by the unions themselves. Key workers – from nurses to firemen, teachers to postmen – could cause chaos if they decide to join the walkout.

The plan raises the possibility of firemen and nurses striking on Guy Fawkes night, a move which could force people to cancel parties due to health and safety fears.

Unions are legally allowed to ‘co-ordinate’ their strike action, or organise walkouts on the same day, as long as they have each successfully balloted their workforce on separate trade disputes. This is not the same as organising ‘sympathy strikes’ where workers walk out in support of other striking workers without having held a legal ballot. These were outlawed during the 1980s.

Yesterday Unite’s executive director of policy Steve Turner said he believes the ‘yes’ vote has committed the union to a policy of ‘fighting back, industrially where possible’.

He added: ‘But more than that, it commits us to organise a mass mobilisation.’
