While blizzards, snow and freezing conditions batter parts of the East Coast, unseasonably warm temperatures across the rest of the country mean the U.S. is experiencing one of its warmest winters on record. 

Almost the entirety of the country's West has experienced significantly warmer than average temperatures across December and January, while parts of the East Coast, including New York and Boston  are continuing to be battered by a freezing storm system.

In this month alone thousands of warm weather records have been broken as high temperatures across the western states contributes to what is now the country's sixth-warmest winter on record.

The West is experiencing temperatures which have contributed to the country's sixth-warmest winter on record. Pictured is Lake Success, near East Porterville, California, where drought conditions are worsening

So far this month there have been 4,074 records set for warm temperatures across the West, USA Today reported. This includes hot weather records in Seattle, San Jose, Las Vegas, Reno and Salt Lake City.

Remarkably, the average February temperature in Salt Lake City is 16.4degrees above average, while Boise is up 12.2degrees and Phoenix 8degrees.

Last month, the West, Rocky Mountains and Northern and Central Plains were all warmer than average, with many maintaining hot temperatures that placed the month among their top ten warmest averages.

Incredibly, San Francisco had no measurable rainfall during January, while the state of California itself had its fourth-driest ever January.

As well as remaining unseasonably warm, much of the West continues to suffer drought conditions.

Nearly all of Hawaii was drier than average, with drought expanding to 46.6per cent of the state, according to the National Climatic Data Center.

And although the drought improved in parts of the Southern Plains and Southwest, it worsened in the West and Midwest.

The dry area spans California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma and other parts of the region, directly affecting more than 64 million people. 

In contrast to the big dry in the West, Winter Storm Octavia - which follows a weekend storm that dumped 16.5 inches of snow on Boston over the weekend - is now set to pummel  the South.

Residents in Boston have battled through 16.5 inches of snow while New Yorkers are preparing for another six inch-dumping.

In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Washington DC was bracing for between four to eight inches of snow, according to USA Today.

Mayor Muriel Bowser told CNN's 'The Situation Room' that the weather was 'dangerous cold'. Federal government offices in the area will be closed on Tuesday.

Father south, up to a foot of snow was forecast in Roanoke and Richmond, Virginia, where Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a statewide emergency.

Residents have been advised to avoid non-essential travel, while thousands of children in the region are missing school for a second day running

Kentucky and Tennessee were also preparing to be battered by the storm, which could dump more than a foot of snow on each state.
