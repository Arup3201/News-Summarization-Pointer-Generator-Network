World-renowned violinist Min -Jin Kym was eating a sandwich at Euston Station when her violin was stolen. Police believe they may finally have traced it to Bulgaria

A £1.2 million Stradivarius stolen from a world renowned violinist as she sat in a railway cafe may have been recovered in Bulgaria.

The rare instrument was taken as Min-Jin Kym ate in a Pret a Manger at Euston station in 2010. 

She had placed it on the floor as she say with her cellist boyfriend while she made a call on her phone.

Irish traveller traveller John Maughan - working with two teenager accomplices as a distraction - snatched the instrument.

The Stradivarius- one of only 400 in existence - has never been recovered. 

Maughan, completely unaware of its value, tried to sell it for just £100 to a man sitting next to him at an internet cafe but he was turned down because the man's daughter already had a recorder.

Maughan, 41, was jailed for four and a half years at Blackfriars Crown Court in 2011. His own barrister said the violin was 'priceless and irreplaceable'.

But the 1698 instrument, which Ms Kym bought ten years before the theft for £750,000, remained unaccounted for.

Now police believe it may have been recovered after undercover detectives in Bulgaria were offered a Stradivarius for £250,000 from alleged gypsy crime boss Hristo Varbanov.

The British Transport Police confirmed they are investigating whether the violin is Ms Kym's.

Only three Stradivarius' are known to be missing and police believe there is a strong chance it is the same instrument.

A spokeswoman said: 'We're trying to establish with the underwriters and international colleagues the instrument's background.'

Ms Kym, who is signed to record label Sony BMG, was the youngest scholar ever at the Purcell school and has played with the Royal Philharmonic and toured Europe.

Virtuoso Ruggiero Ricci said of her: 'She is that rare species - a born violinist'.

There are only 400 violins made by legendary creator Antonio Stradivari left in existence and the finest Stradivarius examples are worth up to £8million (file picture)

During the theft trial, prosecutor Mark James-Dawson said the violin represented the musician's life savings.

He said: 'This isn't a female with a monumental amount of money. This is her life, her profession.

'She is one of the top violinists in the world and she has this instead of a house, instead of a car and she gets to a violin of this value by trading up as one would a mortgage as she's become more successful.'

Ms Kym's violin was produced during 
Stradivari's 'long pattern' period 1690 to 1699 when he experimented 
with violins that were up 0.3in longer than his usual 14in model, 
resulting in a tiny difference in sound.

Antonio Stradivari set up shop in Cremona, Italy, in the late 17th century selling violins for 12 pistols, a local currency at the time but are now worth millions.

In October 2010 a 1697 Stradivarius sold for £2.3million, which was originally thought to belong to Napoleon Bonaparte.
