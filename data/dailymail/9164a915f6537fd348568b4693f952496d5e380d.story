As Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were announced as the new faces of Balmain's 'Army Of Lovers' it signified the end of a very important year for the couple. 

For the decision by the brand's creative director Olivier Rousteing (a close friend of the Kardashian family) to cast the reality TV star and her rapper husband was a controversial one.

But it is symbolic of their meteoric rise to becoming the most powerful couple of 2014, a title previously bestowed on their close friends Beyonce, 33, and Jay Z, 45.

This year Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have usurped Beyonce and Jay Z in terms of their popularity 

For in a year that Bey and Jay have faced rumours of marriage trouble and controversy over everything from their song lyrics to photoshopping Instagram posts, Kim, 34, and 37-year-old Kanye's joint profile has been going from strength to strength.

Especially since they've firmly cemented themselves within the fashion clique as one of the world's most stylish couples, counting Givenchy head honcho Ricardo Tisci as a close companion.

Indeed, it was Vogue editor Anna Wintour who gave them the first seal of approval, putting a wedding dress-clad Kim and a suited Kanye  on the magazine's front cover in April.

The edition featuring the power couple - nicknamed Kimye - sold an estimated 150,000 more copies than when Beyonce appeared on the cover the previous year.

Hot topic: Ms Wintour explained that if Vogue didn't reflect modern culture - even the more provocative figures within it - 'nobody would talk about us. It's very important that people do talk about us'

Anna Wintour said of the cover: 'Part of the pleasure of editing Vogue, one that lies in a long tradition of this magazine, is being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it.

'I think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and Kanye to a T. (Or perhaps that should be to a K?)

'As for the cover, my opinion is that it is both charming and touching, and it was, I should add, entirely our idea to do it; you may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancée on Vogue's cover.

'He did nothing of the sort,' she explained. 'The gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn't true.' 

Kim and Kanye's wedding photograph, which took four days of editing was the most liked Instagram post of all time

By May, when the couple married in a lavish ceremony at Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy, they were all anyone could talk about.

The wedding photograph, which they posted on Instagram, took four days of editing - an image-managing endeavour that paid off when it became the most 'liked' post ever on the social networking site.

Meanwhile Beyonce and Jay Z, who  missed Kim and Kanye's nuptials amid rumours of a falling out between the two women, were facing problems.

Beyonce and Jay Z made headlines for all the wrong reasons when footage was leaked of Beyonce's sister Solange attacking Jay in a lift at the MET Gala in May

Shortly before the wedding the pair had been involved in an incident now known as 'liftgate'.

Following the Met Gala in New York in May Beyonce's sister Solange was filmed by a CCTV camera – the footage from which was later leaked – attacking her sister's husband in a lift.

Speculation whirled about the reason for the outburst and why Beyonce stood still in the corner of the lift, doing nothing to stop her sister. 

The following months were rife with reports that Beyonce and Jay Z had hit a rocky patch in their marriage and were heading for a divorce.

The rumours continued to whirl until June when the pair began their joint On The Run tour.

Meanwhile, Kimye  were happy and hugely successful. They celebrated their daughter North's first birthday in June with a theme park 'Kidchella'-themed party.

And in the same month Kim released Kim Kardashian Hollywood, a downloadable game that has gone on to make $43million (£27.7million).

Then in September the pair hit fashion week and, bringing North along for the ride, proceeded to make headlines around the world.

Beyonce has faced internet debate that she has  photoshopped pictures of herself on her  Instagram feed

Beyonce watchers have speculated that an airbrushing tool was used to modify this image

And in November, as Beyonce faced more heated conjecture about whether her Instagram pictures had been altered, Kim released the most eye-catching image of her career.

She posed half-naked, showing off her oiled bottom on the cover of Paper magazine and became one of the most talked-about women in the world in the process.

In fact, Kim and Kanye have seemingly had a better year than Beyonce and Jay Z in every way -except for one. 

The singer and her rapper and mogul husband Jay still continue to earn more money than their younger counterparts, and are believed to have a joint net worth of more than $1billion (£644million) compared to Kimye's $105million (£68million).
