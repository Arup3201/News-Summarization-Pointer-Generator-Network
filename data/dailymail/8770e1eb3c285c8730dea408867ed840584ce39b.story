Chris Sutton has told the SFA they must hold bungling officials to account.

The former Celtic striker has branded additional official Alan Muir 'idiotic' for failing to see a handball by Inverness Caley Thistle defender Josh Meekings in Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final.

Meekings is now fighting a ban from the Scottish Cup Final following a Notice of Complaint from the SFA compliance officer.

Insisting the officials should not escape scot free either, however, Sutton says Muir should be kept away from high-profile games if he's not up to the job.

'There's not a conspiracy theory or anything like that,' he insisted. 'It was just an absolute shocker. I just can't work out what he was thinking.

'It was just idiotic how he didn't see it. It wasn't a conspiracy, I just can't remember a decision that bad from someone standing so close.

'There is no way he could have thought that ball hit the player on the head, he must be an idiot not to see it. It's just ridiculous.'

A goal ahead at the time, Celtic reacted to 'supporter pressure' by writing to the SFA seeking clarification on the failure of referee Steven McLean to award a penalty and send Meekings off.

Sutton infamously triggered a huge row in 2003 when he accused Dunfermline of 'lying down' to Rangers to pip Celtic to the title on the final day.

Insisting Sunday was a question of incompetence rather than integrity, however, he added: 'It's not a conspiracy, it's just a rubbish and inept decision.

'It shouldn't happen and it doesn't reflect well on the Scottish game if decisions like that are made.

'I don't know if maybe he (Muir) panicked, but he has a job to do and if he is not up to the job — which he clearly wasn't — then he shouldn't do it again.

'You can understand the frustration of the Celtic fans and players and the manager's frustration.

'I'm not saying that changes the perception of what Ronny Deila has done. As the season has gone on Celtic have got stronger — but you have to say it's a chance to win a Treble missed due to not just a poor decision, but an awful one.'

Speaking at a charity golf day for the John Hartson Foundation, Sutton echoed his former team-mate in querying the club's decision to write to the SFA — an action which has infuriated fans of other clubs.

'The SFA will write back and just say he didn't see,' he continued.

'You know what's going to happen and it's a waste of a stamp.

'I think Celtic will be harbouring grudges for quite some time — and quite rightly so.'

Hartson added: 'I can't fathom out what Celtic are going to gain by writing a letter to the SFA.'
