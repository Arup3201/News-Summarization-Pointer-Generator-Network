The U.S. Secret Service played a key role in the investigation of free-information activist and Reddit founder Aaron Swartz and watched his case closely until he committed suicide, according to newly-released government documents.

Swartz, 26, hanged himself in his Brooklyn apartment in January as he faced trial on charges he hacked into a Massachusetts Institute of Technology archive of scholarly articles with the aim of making the information freely available.

The documents, released under the Freedom of Information Act, show the Secret Service field office in Boston secured documents and electronic devices seized during searches of Swartz's home and research office at Harvard University.

Swartz was present for at least one search of his Cambridge home, according to a February 2011 document that reads: 'While the search was conducted, Swartz made statements to the effect of, what took you so long, and why didn't you do this earlier?'

Agents also joined local police who interviewed Swartz's associates, including a San Francisco woman who told them that he called her and asked her to call his lawyer to arrange bail.

The Secret Service documents were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Wired.

Only the first 104 pages of the agency's 14,500-page file on Swartz have been released. The Secret Service plans to release the rest of the documents on a rolling basis after being ordered by a U.S. District Court judge last month to fulfill Wired's information request.

Swartz was arrested in July of 2011 and charged with stealing 4million documents from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Jstor, an archive of scientific journals and academic papers.Â

A co-founder of Reddit and activist who 
fought to make online content free to the public, his death earlier this year prompted an 
outpouring of grief from prominent voices on the intersection of free 
speech and the Web.

Critics accused the federal government of unfairly trying to make an example out Swartz. His family called his death 'the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach.'

Swartz killed himself weeks before he was to go on trial on accusations that he stole millions of journal articles from an electronic archive in an attempt to make them freely available. If convicted, he faced decades in prison and a fortune in fines.
