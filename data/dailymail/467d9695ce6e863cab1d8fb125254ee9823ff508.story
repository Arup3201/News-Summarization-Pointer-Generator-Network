Carlos Tevez scored a stunning goal to help Juventus crush Parma 7-0 and move provisionally six points clear at the top of the Serie A table on Sunday.

Tevez ran most of the length of the field and beat four men to score Juventus' fourth before doubling his tally minutes later.

'We had a great game,' said the forward, who was recently called up to the Argentina squad for the first time in nearly three-and-a-half years.

'It was important to win and we were good in making hardly any errors. After the last international break, we missed so many goalscoring opportunities, today we made up for our previous mistakes and we were perfect in front of goal.'

Fernando Llorente and substitute Alvaro Morata also both netted twice, with Stephan Lichtsteiner also on target to send Parma to its heaviest defeat in Serie A.

Lazio missed the opportunity to move level with Roma after a 2-1 loss at Empoli.

Chievo Verona beat fellow struggler Cesena 2-1 to move off the bottom of the table, while Palermo drew 1-1 at home to Udinese. Cagliari was also held 1-1 by 10-man Genoa.

Parma travelled to Turin hoping they had kickstarted their season after last week's surprise 2-0 win over Inter Milan ended a club record run of six consecutive defeats.

Juventus, who were coming off the back of a 3-2 victory over Olympiacos in the Champions League, took the lead in the 24th minute when Llorente rushed in to tap home the rebound after Paul Pogba's shot was parried by Antonio Mirante.

Lichsteiner doubled Juve's advantage five minutes later with a scorching 25-yard strike into the top right corner and the Switzerland defender then unselfishly crossed for Llorente to volley home his third goal in as many games.

Tevez had the whole stadium on its feet with his superb individual goal five minutes after the break and he went off to a standing ovation shortly after doubling his tally when Mirante again only parried a Pogba strike.

Morata beat the offside trap to tap home Kingsley Coman's pass, five minutes after coming off the bench, before completing Parma's misery with a volley two minutes from time.

Lazio were looking for a sixth win in seven matches, while Empoli hoped to avoid a fourth successive defeat.

The home side took a surprise lead when Federico Barba headed home a corner for his first Serie A goal seven minutes into the second half.

Former Middlesbrough striker Massimo Maccarone doubled Empoli's lead three minutes later before Filip Djordjevic headed in a consolation for Lazio.

Palermo could have recorded their fourth win in five matches but Franco Vazquez saw his penalty saved by Orestis Karnezis and Paulo Dybala headed off the upright.

Dybala had earlier equalised from the spot shortly before half-time after Cyril Thereau had given Udinese a fifth-minute lead.

Cagliari also missed a penalty in the lunchtime kick-off.

Diego Farias struck his first Serie A goal to put the Sardinian side in front but Genoa were gifted an equaliser when Luca Rossettini tried to intercept a Diego Perotti cross at full stretch and turned it into his own net.

Cagliari should have taken all three points as Daniele Conti curled a free kick on to the post and was brought down by Stefano Sturaro as the move continued.

Sturaro was sent off but Danilo Avelar saw his penalty saved by Mattia Perin and Simone Longo ballooned the rebound wide with the goal gaping.
