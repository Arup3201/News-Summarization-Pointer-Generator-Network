Organisers of the 2015 Rugby World Cup put out a photograph yesterday purporting to show the ‘world’s biggest scrum’. Pah! It looked a tame affair compared to what we had in an Edinburgh shopping centre early teatime.

Ooof, crrrump, thwock, splatt went a surging, throbbing meteorite of humanity.

Somewhere in its core was Ed Miliband, leader of the Labour party, grinning so goofily it looked as if someone had stuck an ironing board in his mouth.

Mobbed: Ed Miliband was caught up in the centre of a barging, shouting group of campaigners yesterday

Welcome to modern electioneering, complete with the bouquet of acidity that has characterised this Scottish referendum.

Mr Miliband sneaked in by a back door. Cue a stampede of people who had been waiting by the shopping centre’s main entrance. By the time they reached Mr Miliband, he was at Ruby Reds Nails and Beauty Bar, where a zoned-out Yes voter was shouting through a megaphone ‘do what Ed says – he is your imperial master’.

A melee formed and soon acquired an energy field all of its own. It contained perhaps 150 steaming bodies, many of them shouting, barging, struggling to keep their balance. The group would move 20 yards, then stop, then set off again at an angle. The TV cameramen had to walk in reverse. At least one toddler’s pushchair was flattened.

The scrum contained No-vote supporters, Yes-vote protesters, a blinking American, political aides, and a few shoppers who had only been trying to get to jewellers H Samuel. 

Plus: HM Leader of the Opposition. A woman entrusted with the task of holding a ‘No’ poster just behind Ed’s head was on the short side. She kept jumping on her tiptoes.

Limbs flew, leaflets fluttered. The background noise was of squawked complaint and minor flesh wounds.

While having an elbow jammed up my left nostril and a stranger step on my ankle, I copped a clear view of Ed Mil’s eyes. They were two liquorice gobstoppers, rotating slowly in different directions.

‘You’re a f****** liar, Miliband!’ screamed a Yes-vote larrikin. ‘Call yerself a socialist?’ offered another sceptic. ‘Shame on you, ****! You’re a scaremonger! Disgrace!’ 

No one could hear what Mr Miliband himself was saying, if anything. One of the ladies holding No-vote posters put a hand to her sore ears and sighed ‘Oh, do stop shouting’. Whereupon she was informed ‘You’re a liar as well!’

Hounded: Most of those around Mr Miliband had their right arms raised, to take snaps with their telephones

Mr Miliband is tall. Each time he set off, his tweezered, hairsprayed coxcomb led the way. Follow that fringe!

Arc lights glowed, flashbulbs pinged, red balloons popped. ’Waaaaaa!’ went a child. Or was it Mr Miliband’s handsome young gofer James, whose composure has been unravelling by the day, poor love?

Most of the people had their right arms raised, to take snaps with their telephones. An evil pong of B.O. was soon brewing. The Socialist Workers’ party, always so helpful, turned up. The melee nearly drove over a metal bench on which a faintly puzzled old gent was sitting. And then, just as quickly as it all started, the Mili-maul ended, with our hero vanishing down a car park lift and legging it round the street corner. Lunacy.

Ferocious: Gordon Brown pictured making one of his booming speeches in Glasgow on Tuesday

Threats: In his speech, Mr Brown argued that if Scotland leaves the UK, ‘inequality will last until Doomsday’

In other developments, Gordon Brown made one of his booming speeches in Glasgow. It took half an hour for my hearing to recover. He made a ferocious denunciation of Alex Salmond’s ‘lies’ on the NHS and noted that Mr Salmond’s main supporters were ‘North Korea’s Jim Kong Yoo, and Rupert Murdoch’. He perhaps meant Kim Jong-Un, but heck, this was Clydebank, so Jim it duly became

Mr Brown argued that if Scotland leaves the UK, ‘inequality will last until Doomsday’ and the worst-affected will be the poor, for the economy will not prosper with the Union.

He may well be right. But Labour has cried wolf on poverty for too long. It has told the Scots they were badly off when, in fact, they were being richly subsidised. If working-class voters refuse to believe Mr Brown, he and his Labour mates may have only themselves to blame.
