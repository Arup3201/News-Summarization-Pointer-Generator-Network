A Canada couple who decided to crowdsource their daughter's name on the internet got precisely what they expected earlier this month.

'All bow down to the great and powerful Cthulhu,' read the Facebook announcement of the April 7 birth after 150,000 cast their votes over the last three months of Alysha McLaughlin's pregnancy.

Lucky for the healthy little girl, Alysha and her husband Stephen were joking and opted to give her the voters' second favorite name, Amelia.

'All bow down to the great and powerful Cthulhu': Some parents to be in Canada opted to crowdsource the naming of there baby girl to the internet and the result doesn't exactly roll off the tongue

Alysha and Stephen McLaughlin asked the internet to name their daughter and they got their wish. But when the result was Cthulhu, they adopted for the name rated second highest among the 150,000 votes: Amelia

Meme: The sci-fi demon Cthulhu (illustrated here, appropriately enough, as a plush toy) is a creation of beloved early 20th century writer H.P. Lovecraft. The tentacled creature has since become a favorite of the meme-generating generation

'Hi, My name is Stephen and much to the disbelief of my wife, I have decided to let the internet name my daughter,' reads the original message on the website namemydaughter.com.

Voters were given the opportunity to give the girl her middle name, too.

However, as with the first name, the couple decided against the top middle moniker pick of All-Spark.

They opted instead for two middle names: Savannah Joy.

Other top 10 middle name picks were Of-The-Sea, Le-Dash-A, Salad and Pond, writes the Global News.

Not that any of those choices really had a chance to begin with, as Stephen made clear in his announcement of the naming contest.

'Unfortunately internet I know better than to trust you,' Stephen wrote. 'We will ultimately be making the final decision, Alas my daughter shall not be named WackyTaco692. Sorry guys the wife wouldn't go for a free for all.'

Not totally crazy: 'Unfortunately internet I know better than to trust yo,' writes Stephen in his initial call for names. 'We will ultimately be making the final decision, Alas my daughter shall not be named WackyTaco692. Sorry guys the wife wouldn't go for a free for all.'
