Clashes between armed vigilantes and members of a drug gang in Mexico have left two people dead and another three injured.

Members of a 'self-defence' patrol took over the main square and town hall yesterday in a village near Tancitaro, in the western state of Michoacan, in a bid to regain control from a drug cartel called the Knights Templar.

Authorities are trying to determine whether the two people who died are vigilantes or Knights Templar members.

Vigilantes, some wearing masks and bandanas and brandishing firearms, continued to occupy the square following the clashes.

Soldiers and police have been sent to the village in a bid to prevent further violence.

Residents in several towns in Michoacan state towns have taken up arms this year in retaliation against the drug cartel, whose members have demanded extortion payments from them.

However, authorities have claimed that some of the vigilantes are backed by a rival drug gang from a neighbouring state.

The accusations have been denied by the citizens’ patrols.

Many parts of Mexico have been plagued by drug gang-related violence and a government crackdown on organised crime has cost an estimated 70,000 lives over the past seven years.

The problem has become so serious that a Roman Catholic bishop, Miguel Patino Velazquez, said last month that Michoacan 'has all the characteristics of a failed state'.

His stance has made headlines in Mexico and highlighted the violence in the region, which lies to the west of Mexico City.

The bishop said that five of his priests had been murdered by the drug gangs for their support of vigilante forces.
