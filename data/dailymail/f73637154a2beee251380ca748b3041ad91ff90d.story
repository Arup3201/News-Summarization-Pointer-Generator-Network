The practice of attending spas as a healthy treat has been a century-long tradition, as seen in these photographs from pre-revolutionary Russia.

The unidentified men in the photos are seen performing massages and cleansing rituals in the famous Oriental baths in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in 1890.

In one photograph one of the men is carrying out what appears to be a rather painful massage method, walking down the other man’s back.

Re-creation: A photo from 1890s pre-revolutionary Russia shows a massage session in full flow at Oriental baths of Tbilisi, now capital of Georgia

After the pair, climb, pound and 
stretch each other’s limbs in the name of good health they share a shisha pipe.

The Oriental baths of Tbilisi is a tourist attraction to this day and the old baths take up an entire district of the city.

At the time of these photographs, 
Georgia was part of the Russian Empire and the aristocracy frequently 
travelled to the sulphur springs in the Georgian version of Bath to 
‘cleanse’.

The tradition of spa therapy dates 
back to classic Greece where great thinkers such as Hippocrates and 
Homer enjoyed ‘recreational baths’ to clear their minds.

Treatment: The man on the massage table looks up at the photographer whilst the second man gets to work

Balancing act: The Oriental baths in Tbilisi seen in these photographs from 1890 are still visited by hundreds every day and is a popular tourist attraction

Russian relaxation: The popular spa-city of Tibilisi attracted wealthy Russians who wanted to relax in the world-famous Oriental baths

Flexibility: A 1890 'Oriental massage' in Tibilisi's baths was nothing for the stiff-jointed as this masseur can be seen tugging at the man's arm

No pain, no gain: Performing an 'Eastern spine massage' the masseur stands on the man's hands and legs

Cleansing: Spa baths have been in practice since the times of Homer and Hippocrates in classic Greece

And relax: A shisha-pipe has been brought in as one of the men gets a final scrub
