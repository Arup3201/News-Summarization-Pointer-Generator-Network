Sam Allardyce believes Manchester United have entered panic mode in the transfer market after failing to deliver signings for David Moyes last season.

Moyes was sacked in April having failed to live up to the expectations at Old Trafford, and his permanent successor Louis van Gaal has since spent close to £150million on new players.

And Allardyce, speaking exclusively to The Sun, sympathises with Moyes after the Scot wasn't backed with the same amount of money.

Angel di Maria and Falcao were marquee signings for Manchester United but they're still struggling

'There was a complacency by United in not going out and delivering the signings David felt he needed,' the West Ham manager said. 'Now there's a panic on.'

Moyes brought in Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata over two transfer windows during his time at the club, while Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and even Radamel Falcao  arrived in the summer for Van Gaal.

Allardyce added that Moyes wasn't able to sign the players he wanted at United, which may have affected the results on the field.

'He will obviously look at what he might have done better but he should have done better but he should have got the players he wanted and he tells me he didn't get any of them.'
