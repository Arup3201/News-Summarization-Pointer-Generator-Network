Lukas Podolski provided an assist for Xherdan Shaqiri to set Inter Milan on their way to a 2-0 victory over nine-man Sampdoria in the Coppa Italia.

Swiss star Shaqiri provided a powerful finish from the German forward's pass as Roberto Mancini's side moved into the last 16 with a tough victory at the San Siro.

Inter struggled to break down Sampdoria despite playing most of the match with a numerical advantage.

Nenad Krsticic was sent off in the 12th minute after he brought down Mauro Icardi, with the forward adjudged to have been clean through on goal.

Icardi could have given Inter the lead shortly before halftime but Sampdoria goalkeeper Sergio Romero saved his penalty after Pawel Wszolek had bundled over Dodo.

The deadlock was finally broken in the 71st minute. Podolski did well to hold up the ball in the area before slotting it through to Shaqiri for his first Inter goal on his first start for the club since joining from Bayern Munich.

Any hope Sampdoria had of taking the match to extra time all but evaporated six minutes later when Wszolek was sent off for a second booking.

Icardi atoned for his earlier penalty failure by sealing the match two minutes from time, firing into an empty net after a poor back pass left Romero in trouble and forced him out of his area.
