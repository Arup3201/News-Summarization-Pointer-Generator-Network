Prince William, wearing a blanket to keep warm, arrives at the Semongkong Children's Centre in Lesoth in 2010

After a particularly trying day, some of us might unwind with a cup of tea or a hot bath. But Prince William, it seems, has a slightly wilder solution. 

The Duke of Cambridge has revealed he listens to animal noises on his iPhone to relax – inspired by the love of Africa he inherited from his mother. 

While his father Prince Charles has admitted he talks to plants while indulging in a little gardening, William confessed to having several hundred sound effects – such as crickets and buffalos – on his mobile phone, which remind him of the country where he proposed to wife Kate. 

In an interview about his love for Africa and his charity work there, Prince William said: ‘I regularly daydream.

'Africa is definitely one of the places I go to ... I have hundreds of animals on my iPhone.

So if I am ever having quite a stressful day ... you can put a buffalo on in the background or a cricket.‘It takes you back instantly to the bush. And it does completely settle me down.’ 

Prince William revealed how his mother Princess Diana inspired his passion, saying her ‘infectious enthusiasm and energy’ for Africa and its people could not fail to rub off on him.

He said: ‘She would come back with all these stories  and full of excitement and  just passion for what she had been doing and I sort of used to sit there, quite a sort of  surprised little boy at the time, taking it all in.’ 

And his connection to the continent is so strong that he chose to propose while on holiday in Kenya in 2010. 

He said: ‘I didn’t really plan it that far in advance. I just knew I wanted it to feel comfortable where I did it and I wanted it to mean something, other than just the act of getting engaged. 

‘[Kate] understands what it means to me being in Africa.’ 

William was speaking in a documentary, Prince William’s Passion: New Father, New Hope, which looks at his commitment to conservation in Africa.

The Prince, who is royal patron of conservation organisation Tusk Trust, said his ‘protective’ instinct has kicked in since the birth of Prince George in July. He said he has been spurred on to do more to protect ‘vulnerable’ wildlife, such as cheetahs, one of his favourite animals.

He said: ‘Suddenly you start thinking of like, wow, there is stuff you want to safeguard for the future. I’ve always believed it, but to actually really feel it as well, it’s coming through powerfully now as well.’ 

He also revealed how he has become more emotional since the birth of his son.

Prince William is following in the footsteps of both of his parents in terms of his love for Africa, but particularly Charles who fell for the continent partly thanks to his close friendship with South African writer Laurens Van der Post.

It was even once reported that Van der Post, Charles's spiritual guru, taught the Prince of Wales how to talk to plants.

When Charles and Diana announced who would be godparents of Prince William, it was Prince Charles' spiritual guru who made the cut.

Sir Laurens Van der Post was a South African writer and long time friend of the Queen Mother's family, the Bowes-Lyons.

He grew up on a South African farm in Philippolis but emigrated to London when he was 21.

Despite this, his heart remained in Africa and 11 of his 20 books are about the continent.

Van der Post died in 1996 aged 90 but his legacy seems to be living on in the two Princes.

‘The last few weeks have been a very 
different emotional experience – something I never thought I would feel 
for myself,’ he said.

‘I find, even though it’s only been a short period, that a lot of things affect me now.’

In the interview, William admitted that his visits to Africa help him to indulge the side of his character that craves a sense of normality, away from the maelstrom of royal life.

‘It’s escaping to a kind of different world where I am just who I normally am anyway, and I can let that side, that sort of slightly immature, silly person come out a bit more than I normally do,’ he said. 

‘There’s not sycophants or anything like that. You’re very much treated as one of the team, and if you’re not pulling your weight, you’re told to man up and get on with it.’ 

But he might have to wait a while for his next trip to Africa.

‘I think as soon as George grows up a little bit more [I’ll go],’ he said, before joking: ‘I will be hung [sic] if I go now ... [but] it’s definitely a plan of mine to go back.’ 

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will make their first red carpet appearance together since the birth of their son on Thursday at the Tusk Trust’s Conservation Awards in London, where the Duke will present the Prince William Award for Conservation in Africa.

Prince William’s Passion: New Father, New Hope will be shown on ITV at 6pm on Sunday September 15 and on CNN International at 3am, 6am, 12pm, and 8pm on Monday September 16.
