A baby girl has been born in the West Bank after her father’s sperm was smuggled out of an Israeli prison.

Baby Yasmeen was conceived through artificial insemination and born on Wednesday at a hospital in the West Bank City of Nablus.

Proud mother Samira Nimr smiled as she held her newborn baby, but the father could only be present in a picture above the hospital bed.

Palestinian Yahya Nimr is currently serving a life sentence in an Israeli prison and is not allowed conjugal visits.

This is not the first time Palestinian babies have been born to men locked in Israeli jails, with at least three similar cases being reported in the past three years.

In 2012, Dallal Ziben, 32, gave birth to baby Muhannad after being artificially inseminated by 37-year-old husband Ammar, a Hamas activist who is currently serving 32 life sentences in an Israeli prison.

Palestinians are not permitted to receive conjugal visits, and although Mrs Ziben had not set eyes on her husband for 15 years, Ammar’s sperm was smuggled out of Hadarim prison in central Israel.

Details of how the sperm is smuggled out of the prisons is kept a closely guarded secret.

A spokesman for the Israel Prisons Service said she was not aware of the pregnancy, and that security prisoners were not allowed conjugal visits, with the Palestinian Prisoners' Club confirming the same information.

'Visits by prisoners' wives are closely supervised by prison guards and there is no way a prisoner could get time alone with his wife,' the Nablus-based spokesman said in 2012

In the past, fertility clinics in Nablus have been known to carry out artificial inseminations for Palestinian couples where the husband is imprisoned.
