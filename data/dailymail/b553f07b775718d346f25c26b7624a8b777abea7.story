More than 100,000 jobless foreigners will be forced to learn English to the standard of a nine-year –old or face losing their benefits.

Chancellor George Osborne said it was a ‘reasonable requirement’ to expect people who want to work in Britain to learn the language.

He unveiled a £350million package of extra support to prepare the jobless for the work place including forcing them to attend jobcentres more often.

Tough: New rules will force the unemployed to wait seven days instead of three before they receive Jobseekers Allowance, with the money spent on extra help to get them back into work

But anyone who loses their job will have to wait longer before they can start receiving benefits.

The new welfare package was one of the biggest surprises in Mr Osborne’s statement, setting out £11.5billion of spending cuts for 2015-16.

The savings are on top of £3.6billion in cuts to the welfare budget already announced.

People who lose their jobs will have to wait seven days - instead of three- before receiving Jobseeker's Allowance.

But the Lib Dems have blocked any more cash savings being made in the welfare budget, so the money will be spent on making the jobless do more to find work.

Warning: George Osborne told the Commons that people who refuse to learn English will have their benefits cut

A Tory MP who tried to air his support for getting tough on the unemployed who have poor levels of English was left red-faced after including a spelling mistake in a tweet.

Andrew Selous, a former shadow pensions minister, took to Twitter to voice his support for cutting benefits for people on Jobseekers Allowance who do not speak English to the standard of a 9-year-old.

But he accidentally wrote: 'Strongly support the loss of benefits unless claimants lean English.'

The unemployed will have to go to jobcentres every week instead of once a fortnight, have their job hunting efforts regularly reviewed and given extra training in writing CVs and preparing for job interviews.

Mr Osborne said: 'Those first few days should be spent looking to work, not looking to sign on.'

People who refuse to make an effort to learn English will also have their benefits cut.

Around a third of the £350million in savings will be spent on English lessons for 100,000 people to reach Entry Level Two standard – the average language ability of a 9-year-old.

Mr Osborne said: ‘From now on, if claimants don’t speak English, they will have to attend language courses until they do.

‘This is a reasonable requirement in this country. It will help people find work.

‘But if you’re not prepared to learn English, your benefits will be cut.’

A new ‘upfront work search’ will require all new claimants to prepare for work and search for jobs right from the start of their claim.

Half of claimants will have to turn up to jobcentres once a week, instead of once a fortnight at present

Half of jobseekers will have to sign on at Jobcentres once a week, instead of once a fortnight, to give them more incentive to find work.

All Jobseekers Allowance claimants will also have to verify their claim every year.

And unemployed single parents will have to start preparing for work when their youngest child turns three, but they will only face sanctions for not taking a job once their child is five years old.

Mr Osborne added: ‘Half of all jobseekers need more help looking for work, so we’ll require them to come to the jobcentre every week rather than once a fortnight.

‘We’re going to give people more time with jobcentre advisors and proper progress reviews every three months.

‘And we’re going to introduce a new seven day wait before people can claim benefits.

‘Those first few days should be spent looking for work, not looking to sign on.

‘We’re doing these things because we know they help people stay off benefits and help those on benefits get back into work faster.’
