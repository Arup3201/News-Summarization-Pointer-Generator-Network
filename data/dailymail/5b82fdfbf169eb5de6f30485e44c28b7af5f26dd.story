Just hours after Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected the 256th Pope, President Cristina Kirchner appeared to be gearing up to use Francis I 's powerful new status to Argentina’s advantage.

In a televised address Ms Kirchner said she hoped the new Pope would 'take a message to the major world powers that they need to participate in dialogue.'

It is feared that if Argentinians interpret the latest development as an intervention by God on their side, it could be a catalyst for nationalism.

Kirchner has already said that she hopes the new Pope will take a message to the world's powers telling them they can't ignore the emerging countries

The Argentinian Pope Francis has sparked with Kirchner in the past over Gay marriage and implied that women should not hold office

Tensions between Argentine and British governments grew last year as the 30th anniversary of the war for control of the South Atlantic islands approached.

Meanwhile military chiefs have drawn up plans for a 'show of force' to warn off any Buenos Aires sanctioned-aggression after Falkland Islanders voted to remain under UK sovereignty in a referendum this week.

Kirchner added that God and the Virgin would also wish just causes to sometimes triumph

After wishing her compatriot luck, Kirchner said: '(We hope) that (his mission) takes the message to the major powers in the world to participate in dialogue ... that the great powers in the world, who have arms and financial power, can be convinced to finally heed the emerging countries and that they commit to a dialogue of civilisations where things are resolved by diplomatic channels rather than by force.'

She added pointedly: 'We ask God that he help make it possible that just causes also sometimes triumph in this blessed land we call Earth, because I am sure that God and the Virgin also wish it so.'

President Kirchner's relationship with the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires has until now been thorny, the two having engaged in open battle over gay marriage.

When the conservative cardinal called for God's War on her government's gay marriage proposals, Kirchner accused him of putting forward ideas 'from the Dark Ages and the Inquisition'. He replied that women were to inept to hold political positions.

But given her one time enemy’s new sway, not to mention infallibility, all that seems to be water under the bridge-the Argentine premier has already cleared her diary to fly to Rome for the inaugural mass on Tuesday.

Despite their apparent differences, the two share a hostile rhetoric when it comes to the islands. As recently as 2010 Bergoglio declared: ‘The Malvinas are ours.’

Speaking at a Maundy Thursday ceremony a day before the 28th anniversary of the Falklands in April 2010, Bergoglio had urged the Argentinian people to remember those who had fallen during the war'.

He said: ‘We must not forget those whose blood was shed on Argentinian soil.’

Kirchner maintains that the Falklands are Argentina's land. Pictured, the 40 Commando, Royal Marines in Port Howard, West Falkland during the war

'Dialogue is good for everyone, but this dialogue is difficult because it presupposes both sides take small steps.

He added: 'Let's not forget. At meetings like these, reconciliation is the right thing to do, but the Malvinas are ours.'

And just last year he used a memorial service for the 30th anniversary of the start of the the war to rail at Britain who he accused of ‘usurping’ the islands.

During a mass in Buenos Aires on April 2 he told former conscripts and families of those who died: 'We come to pray for those who have fallen, sons of the homeland who set out to defend his mother, the homeland, to claim the country that is theirs and they were usurped.

'Many young people were there and could not return. Others returned but none could forget.

'Many scars, many families destroyed by permanent absence or a return cut short. The country needs to remember them all.'
