Parents in Newtown, Connecticut, are reportedly being called in one by one to positively identify the bodies of children following Friday's tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Reuters deputy social media editor Matthew Keys tweeted the news on Friday around 11.30pm saying he heard it on WNBC.

The bodies of the dead students are still being held inside the school, sources at the scene of the shooting told MailOnline.

Residents of the small town Newtown came together this evening to express their grief this evening at a memorial service for the 20 children and six staff members gunned down today at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Approximately 1,000 mothers, fathers, children, and grandparents flocked to St Rose of Lima Catholic church, whose congregation lost six children at the hands of shooter Adam Lanza, 20.

Parents held their children close, poignantly carrying them past a candlelit nativity scene as the church was filled to the rafters, with hundreds having to stand in the freezing cold to pay their respects to the tragic dead.

Craig Hoekenen arrived at St Rose of Lima church with his wife Tracy and their nine-year old boy C.J. and seven-year old Matthew who was at Sandy Hook School as the massacre unfolded.

Speaking to MailOnline in front of the bright lights and flashing cameras of the world's media, little Matthew described how he had to walk over 'smashed glass and blood' as he was led to safety by policemen who told him to 'close his eyes'.

'We were doing our morning stretches, when we heard guns going off' said second grade student Matthew, who his mother described as 'scared out of his mind' by the traumatic experience.

The schoolboy’s mother Tracy said that when she received the phone call informing her that her son's school had gone into lockdown she felt 'unable to breathe.'

Those who knew families affected by the tragedy chose not to identify anyone involved, but it is thought that the children killed by Adam Lanza were from kindergarten and first grade. One entire kindergarten class remains unaccounted for.

'I was working at home when a police officer friend phoned me,' said Billy Alvares, who attended the service with his daughter Cynthia, a third grader at the school.

'Evil visited this community today... each parent, each sibling, each member of the family has to understand that Connecticut - we're all in this together. We'll do whatever we can to overcome this event.'

‘He told me that a shooting had occurred at the school and then my phone rang with the automatic lock-down call that parents receive. I can't tell you or describe to you the feeling of knowing that my daughter was in danger and when I was reunited with her I was so shaken up.

'I am fortunate but others are not. Who would ever do such a thing as this?'

St Rose of Lima has space for 500 people but the church overfilled as Monsenior Weiss led a congregation including Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy in mourning.

'Evil visited this community today and it's too early to speak of recovery, but each parent, each sibling, each member of the family has to understand that Connecticut,' Malloy said.

'We're all in this together. We'll do whatever we can to overcome this event.

‘We lit 26-candles today to remember the victims of the shooting,' Serif Weiss said after the service.'We say that but we must acknowledge that 28 people died today including the shooter. A lot of parents lost their hearts today but I detected no anger today from them. We must hope a good resolution comes from this.'

Murderer: Adam Lanza, a troubled 20-year-old loner with a history of autistic behavior, is the monster behind a horrific shooting at a Connecticut elementary school that left 26 people, including 20 children, dead

was off school today with a sprained ankle.

The eight year-old is in the third grade at sandy hook school and her parents were alerted to the horrific attack unfolding as they received the automated call from the school authorities.

"We went to code red,' we just looked at each other and said 'oh my God'  said Paul.

'We assumed it was the high school that had been attacked but we live down the road from the school and realized it was the kids who were at risk.'

'This is such a close community, I got married at this church, my sister and brother got married at this church.'We know two of the families who lost their son in the attack. We had dinner with them last week.'Their boys were six or seven, it is a tragedy.'

Father Petrucci was the chaplain at the Danbury Hospital when three victims of the shooting, one woman and two children arrived.

'The two children sadly died, but I was not involved with them at any point,' said the 65-year-old priest.

Lingering: After the vigil, many remained in the church to pray or meditate

'The woman, who I will not name is doing well, but was shot but not seriously.'

As the service ended, the congregation slowly filed out to pray at the feet of a statue of the Virgin Mary outside the church.'

Hours after the prayer vigil at St Rose of Lima Church and as midnight approached, dozens of mourners lingered, bowing their heads in silent prayer or staring straight ahead, their eyes welling up with tears.

There was complete silence except for the opening and closing of the church doors, as more people found their way in. Some were alone. Others took solace with a spouse, child or parent.
