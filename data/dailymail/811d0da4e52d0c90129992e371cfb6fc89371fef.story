A sheriff has credited Facebook in assisting in the arrest of a domestic violence suspect on Tuesday.

Andrew Dale Marcum, 21, was also wanted on charges of burglary (safe-cracking), abduction,  and assault in Ohio. 

The Butler County Sheriff’s Office posted three pictures of Marcum on Facebook on Tuesday saying that the 21-year-old was wanted on a slew of charges.

Sheriff Jones also had a message for 21-year-old Marcum who was wanted on burglary and abduction charges in Ohio

According to ABC, the wanted criminal replied, posting under his own photo: 'I ain’t tripping half of them don’t even know me.' 

The sheriff responded: 'If you could stop by the Sheriff’s Office, that’d be great.'

The Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones then tweeted a picture of a prison cell with the caption: 'Hey Andrew Marcum we’ve got your room ready.'

Marcum turned himself in late on Tuesday.

The sheriff's office then returned to Facebook, posting the 21-year-old's mugshot, in which he appears to be crying, with the word 'captured' emblazoned across the bottom. 

A final message read: 'Andrew Dale Marcum will be off Facebook temporarily, because there is no social media access in the Butler County Jail. He's turned himself in.

'Thanks to our Facebook and Twitter friends for helping turn up the heat.'

Hamilton County Police Association then reposted Marcum's picture and wrote: 'He looks sad... Karma has a way of doing that sometimes.' 

Marcum later handed himself in to police on Tuesday - who thanked social media for helping track him down
