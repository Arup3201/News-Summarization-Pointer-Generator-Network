The culinary skills of Pippa Middleton have been defended by the editor of Waitrose magazine, in which the Duchess of Cambridge's sister has been given a new food column.

William Sitwell called Pippa 'tremendous', and said that Pippa's Friday Night Feasts is 'fantastic'. He accused her doubters of being jealous of her good fortune and skills.

He went on to compare Kate's sister's ideas to those of Cordon Bleu-trained chef Yotam Ottolenghi and Ben Tish, the man behind one of London's leading tapas restaurants, Salt Yard.

William Sitwell, editor of Waitrose magazine, defended his newest columnist, calling her 'fantastic' and 'tremendous'

Speaking to local radio station Siren FM, Sitwell said: 'She's on tremendous form. The first column comes out next week so we can expect the usual flurry of abuse from newspapers and food bloggers who are jealous that they haven't got columns.

'In the mix of the magazine, her stuff is fantastic. She's there alongside Yotam Ottolenghi and some other up-and-coming chefs like Ben Tish from Salt Yard.

'You'll still see an array of talent that we use. She's done her very first series as an Asian-themed Friday night feast and I think people will enjoy it. When people see the work that she's doing, they'll calm down.'

Pippa released her first book - a guide 
to party-planning, which did include several recipes - in October last 
year. But she has since parted ways with her agent.

Pippa Middleton releaseed her first book, party-planning guide Celebrate, in October 2012, but has since been dropped by her literary agent after the tome did not sell well

Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities For Families and Friends reportedly netted Pippa a £400,000 advance from publisher Michael Joseph.

But her agent David Godwin last week confirmed that he and the middle child of the Middleton family were no longer working together.

Pippa also runs her own online magazine, Party Times, an offshoot of her family's Party Pieces business.

Can Pippa's party recipes really compete with those of Cordon-Bleu chef Yotam Ottolenghi?

Pippa's book Celebrate features seasonal recipes for entertaining

Brush with 2 beaten egg yolks mixed with a little water, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of paprika and ¼ cup of grated cheddar cheese.3.

YOTAM OTTOLENGHI'S COD CAKES IN A TOMATO SAUCE (from Jerusalem)

Jerusalem is chef Yotam Ottolenghi's third cookbook

INGREDIENTS:

White bread, crusts removed 3 slicesCod (sustainably sourced), halibut, hake or pollock fillet, skinless and boneless 600g1 medium onion, finely chopped4 garlic cloves, crushed30g flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped30g coriander, finely chopped1 tbsp ground cumin1 tsp salt 2 large free-range eggs, beaten4 tbsp olive oil

For the tomato sauce:2 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp ground cumin  ½ tsp sweet paprika1 tsp ground coriander 1 medium onion, chopped 125ml white wine400g  chopped tomatoes1 red chilli deseeded and finely chopped1 garlic clove, crushed2 tsp caster sugar 2 tbsp mint leaves, roughly choppedsalt and black pepper

DIRECTIONS (SERVES 4):

1. First make the tomato sauce. Heat the olive oil in a very large frying pan for which you have a lid, and add the spices and onion.

2. Cook for 8-10 minutes, until the onion is completely soft. Add the wine and simmer for 3 minutes.

3. Add the tomatoes, chilli, garlic, sugar, ½ tsp of salt and some black pepper. Simmer for about 15 minutes, until quite thick, taste to adjust the seasoning and set aside.4. While the sauce is cooking make the fish cakes. Place the bread in a food processor and blitz to form breadcrumbs.

5. Chop up the fish very finely and place in a bowl with the bread and everything else, apart from the olive oil. Mix well and then, using your hands, shape the mixture into compact cakes, about 2cm thick and 8cm wide. The mixture should make 8 cakes. If they are very soft, refrigerate for 30 minutes to firm up. Heat up half the oil in a frying pan and sear the cakes for 3 minutes on each side, so they colour well.6. Add the remaining oil as you fry the cakes. Place the seared cakes gently, side by side, in the tomato sauce. Add enough water to partially cover the cakes, about 200ml. Cover the pan with the lid and simmer on a very low heat for 15-20 minutes.

7. Turn off the heat and leave the cakes to settle, uncovered, for at least 10 minutes before serving warm or at room temperature, sprinkled with mint.
