Chris Avalos labelled Carl Frampton ‘weak’ as tempers flared at the announcement of their world title clash next year.

Frampton makes the first defence of his IBF super-bantamweight belt against the American at the Odyssey Arena on February 28, 2015.

He won the belt with a decision victory over Kiko Martinez in September but Avalos is confident he can take the belt back to California.

‘I’m not going to lose. I’m going to win and it’s not going to be by decision,’ he said.

‘I’m going to get you out way earlier than you got Martinez out.

‘I’ve been studying him a lot and I notice what his mistakes are. I’ve noticed what he slips on.

‘That’s why I know I can beat him. He’s weak.’

Frampton retorted: ‘Remember what he said when I knock him out.

‘I was expecting this, a big mouth. I’m expecting a tough fight but there’s only going to be one winner and that’s me.

‘I’m not looking past this guy but 2015 is going to be massive for me.

‘The difference is, the two times he stepped up, he fought two half decent fighters.'

Chris Martin, not the one from Coldplay, and Jhonatan Romero are fringe world class and both of them beat him.

‘I’m the first world class fighters he’s fought. He’s getting knocked out.’
