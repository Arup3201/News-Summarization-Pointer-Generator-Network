Popular: Sales of jam-making equipment have soared up 2000 per cent this year

The Women’s Institute has spent years trying to shake off the ‘jam and Jerusalem’ image.

But it is now at the heart of a boom in jam-making.

New members are joining local groups to learn the traditional skill, helping to fuel soaring demand for the equipment needed.

Sales of preserving jars, thermometers, jam funnels, boiling pans and gingham jar labels have increased by 2,000 per cent this year, Homebase announced yesterday.

And there has never been a better time to learn, with Britain having enjoyed a glut of summer fruits – thanks to the heatwave that followed a wet spring – and the Daily Mail giving away How To Make Jam recipe cards every day this week.

Janice Langley, chairman of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes, whose members preserved over 5,300 tons of fruit between 1940 and 1945 to help provide food for the nation during the Second World War, was encouraged to see a resurgence in jam-making.

‘The recent glut of fruit will hopefully encourage more people to try making their own jam for the first time and see how easy it is to make the most of our great local produce,’ she said.

‘Many new WI members tell us that they decided to join the organisation to learn traditional skills.’

Rosemary Jameson, director of The Guild of Jam and Preserve Makers, said attendance at jam-making classes had risen significantly.

‘Whereas people used to come and see it as a bit lightweight and just something to try once which they hadn’t done before, now they are taking it seriously because they want to know what is in their food and where it comes from,’ she said. ‘The rising interest is great. People want to be engaged with what they are eating nowadays.

‘Eating something you’ve made yourself not only satisfies your appetite but nourishes you in other ways because it holds memories of the day you made it, which makes it more special.’

As well as the record crops of cherries, 
plums, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and apples reported all 
over the UK this year, sugar supplier Silver Spoon has enjoyed a surge 
in sales of jam sugar.

Good year: Record crops of many British fruit including strawberries have also helped contribute to the surge

‘As a result of the excellent weather, we have seen a rise in the quality and affordability of fresh fruit,’ its marketing director Tony Lucas told The Grocer magazine.

‘Consumers are taking advantage of the fruit harvest to produce jam as a simple and cost-effective summer recipe.’

Homebase Cookshop buyer Mathew Nicholas suggested that today’s generation are eager to return to the habits of their parents and grandparents.

‘Things may be tough but in true stiff-upper lip style, the British nation has clearly decided that there will always be strawberry jam for tea,’ he said.

Will Torrent, an award-winning pastry chef and food consultant, is another convert.

‘Jam-making is one of those things that couldn’t be more British. Picking those wonderful fruits whether in summer or winter and turning them into something you can treasure and enjoy for months to come is priceless,’ he said.

‘I love making jam and the satisfaction you get when you bite into a slice of homemade Victoria sponge with some homemade jam is just heavenly.’
