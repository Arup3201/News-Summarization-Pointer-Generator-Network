Gamze Yilmaz died in a car crash after she became distracted by a WhatsApp message while driving, police have said

A German woman died in a car crash shortly after celebrating her 21st birthday when she became distracted by a WhatsApp message while driving, police have said.

Gamze Yilmaz, who had only just passed her driving test, had been given a Mercedes A class car as a present from her father two weeks before the accident.

She died after veering across the B54 at Herdecke in North Rhine Westphalia, and colliding head first into a Land Rover coming the other way.

A 58-year-old woman and a 62-year-old man in the Land Rover were also critically injured in the incident but survived.

Ms Yilmaz had been pictured sitting inside the car in images she had posted on Facebook shortly before her death.

The family, originally from Turkey before settling in Dortmund, Germany, said they had been left devastated at the news.

Her mother said: 'She was still so young. It is really difficult for my husband and I to come to terms with her death and to live with it.'

She said her daughter had just qualified and earned herself a job as a kindergarten teacher, and was apparently on the way home when the tragedy happened on February 17.

A police investigation discovered Ms Yilmaz received a message on her mobile phone at 1.10pm.

Police said it was a private message over the WhatsApp service.

According to the police report, she was apparently reading the message at the time she crashed head-on into the other vehicle.

Officers believe she had not noticed the road curved at that point as she was distracted by the message.

The police report was handed to prosecutor Beatriz Foehring, 44, who said: 'Based on all the evidence we have concluded that she was distracted by her mobile telephone. It was a tragic accident.'

Police spokesman Martin Pollmann, 50, added: 'I can imagine it was only a second or two in which she glanced at the mobile telephone, and at which point she was effectively driving blind at 80 kilometres an hour for about 45 seconds. It was enough to cause a disaster.'

The young girl's body meanwhile has been flown by her parents back to Turkey where it was buried in the Turkish city of Macka.
