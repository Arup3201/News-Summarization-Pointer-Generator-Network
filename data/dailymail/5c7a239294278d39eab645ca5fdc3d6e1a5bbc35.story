Ultra-long lorries weighing up to 60 tonnes could be allowed into Britain despite fears they will pose a danger to cyclists, pedestrians and other drivers.

Plans to widen the use of 83ft 'Megatrucks', already used in Finland and Sweden and the length of two double-decker buses, are being considered today by European Union officials.

But campaigners claim there is a gulf between Conservative MEPs, who support their boost to business, and those in Westminster who fear they will cause more road deaths.

Monsters: 83ft 'Megatrucks' like this one could soon be allowed on Britain's roads under plans to widen their use

Philippa Edmunds, of the Campaign for Better Transport, told the Telegraph: 'Conservative MEPs plan to support the increased use of massive trucks across the EU.

'This is despite the Westminster government opposing their use on UK roads because they cause more fatal accidents, more congestion and more pollution.

'We risk letting mega trucks on to our roads via the back door.'

The vehicles, known officially as Longer and Heavier Vehicles or LHVs, can be as much as 22ft longer than the largest HGVs currently allowed in Britain.

They transport billions of tonnes each year in Sweden, where they carry 90 per cent of all road freight. The huge trucks also carry almost three-quarters of the road freight in Finland.

Yet they have been slow to spread to other EU countries because of concerns about their safety.

They are being trialled in Denmark, the Netherlands and most recently in Germany, where they are only allowed to use motorways and major national roads.

The trucks were barred from crossing international borders until a ban was partially lifted by the European Commission in March 2012.

The report, to be considered today by the transport committee of the European Parliament, said: 'There is widespread agreement that LHVs would reduce operating costs for road freight and greenhouse gas emissions per tonne-km of goods transported as less vehicles would be used to transport the same amount of goods.'

However, pollution could actually increase if the ultra-long trucks shift more freight away from the railways, the report admitted.

Danger: Shorter HGVs have been involved in several collisions with cyclists in the past, including this one in Camden, north London, in October. There are concerns larger lorries could pose a bigger risk

'LHVs could help with the EUâ€™s objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020, but that there is a significant variation in the predicted impact, and that if modal shift towards road freight is significant, greenhouse gas emissions could in fact increase,' it said.

Conservative MEP Jacqueline Foster told the Telegraph British hauliers should be allowed to compete on a 'level playing field'.

She added the government could refuse entry to Megatrucks if it decided they were 'not appropriate for our roads'.
