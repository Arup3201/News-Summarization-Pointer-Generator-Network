Running: Evelyn Clarke set off a fire extinguisher before falling from the building

Detectives are investigating whether an air hostess who fell to her death in Dubai was fleeing a British businessman she met in a bar.

Emirates flight attendant Evelyn Clarke, 28, ran barefoot into a block of flats in the early hours of Monday morning and told staff: ‘Someone’s trying to kill me’.

The Scot made her way to the eighth floor, where she reportedly set off a fire extinguisher, before falling from a window.

Police suspect that she may have opened the window to escape the fumes from the dry powder extinguisher.

Now, it has emerged that Dubai CID have questioned a British man she met in a hotel bar on the same night.

The man told police that, after drinking together, he invited Miss Clarke back to his flat.

They left on-foot but, when they arrived at his accommodation, she apparently became ‘nervous with him’ and they parted company.

A police source told the Mail: ‘The British man was working in Dubai.

‘He came to speak to us when he heard what had happened.

‘They had met the same day in the bar. He said they had both been drinking and the lady was very drunk. He was drunk also.

‘He said "come with me to my flat" and she went with him to his building.

‘When they were outside, she got nervous with him and did not want to go in, so she left.’

He said detectives had ruled out that it was this man who Miss Clarke felt threatened by.

He said: ‘Maybe this is why she was running, we do not know.

‘He said nothing else happened and we do not believe has committed a crime.’

Minutes later, police say the ‘drunk’ flight attendant jumped into a stranger’s convertible car, which was parked on the road.

When they told her to get out, she ran into the nearest building – leaving her shoes in the car.

At 4.37am, her body was found outside the block of flats, in the Al Mankhool area of Bur Dubai, after falling from the top floor.

The source said: ‘She jumped into a convertible car, through the roof. We don’t know why.

‘There was a Tunisian man and an Egyptian man inside and they were saying "What is happening? Get out, get out. Why are you coming into my car?".

Miss Clarke worked for the airline Emirates and was living with friends in Dubai

‘They said they would call the police and she got out, but she left her shoes behind.

‘She ran into the building.

‘They say she was alone, but there are no security cameras so we cannot be sure.

‘Staff at the building said she was followed by an Indian man, but we just don’t know.’

Miss Clarke, from Ayrshire, ran into the lobby of the building and put her hand out to stop the lift doors closing.

A ‘nicely dressed’ Indian man was reportedly stood behind her, but did not get into the lifts.

Newspaper delivery man Raj Dev, 37, who was inside the lift at the time, said: ‘She seemed scared. She said ‘someone’s trying to kill me’.

‘I said I would call the police but she said ‘no, there’s no need’.

‘I said "come with me to security" but she repeated "no".’

’She got out at the third floor and I did not see her after that.’

When Mr Dev returned to the ground floor, an Indian man was apparently still stood in the lobby.

‘He asked if the lady was staying in the building and I ignored him. I said "security are on their way" and he left.

Mr Dev said he was ‘very sad’ to receive a phone call later that morning from security staff to say she had fallen.

He said: ‘I tried my best to help her, but I think that I should have brought her with me to the security guard. I feel like maybe I could have saved her.’

Miss Clarke was living in Dubai and had returned two days earlier from a six-day work trip to Australia and New Zealand.

Yesterday, her devastated parents met with detectives in Dubai.

They also visited the Emirates accommodation block where their daughter was living with colleagues, two miles away.

Police are still awaiting the results of a post-mortem.

Hundreds of tributes have been left on a Facebook memorial page.

Friend Helen Brown wrote: ‘So privileged to have known such a fun-loving, warm-hearted, caring girl. A cruel and tragic loss.’
