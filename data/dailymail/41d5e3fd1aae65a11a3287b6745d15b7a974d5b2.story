A man accused of raping and setting a Kansas woman on fire in Wichita has been charged in her death.

Charges against Cornell McNeal, 26, were amended Wednesday to include one count of capital murder or an alternative count of first-degree murder, Sedgwick County District Attorney's Office spokesman Dan Dillon said.

Letitia 'Tish' Davis, 36, died on Saturday, a day after McNeal was formally charged with attempted capital murder, rape and arson related to the Nov. 14 attack.

The mother of four suffered burns on more than half her body and cuts on her head. She was found in a Wichita park.

McNeal is being held on a $1.25 million bond in Sedgwick County. His attorney, Mark Rudy, didn't immediately return a phone call seeking comment.

District Attorney Mark Bennett hasn't decided whether to seek the death penalty.

Police said McNeal was linked to the attack by forensic evidence obtained after the woman was taken to a hospital. 

Investigators believe she was attacked following a 'random encounter' with the man, but no details have been released.

Sedgwick County District Court records show that a woman whom McNeal had once dated got a protection from abuse order against him in 2007, alleging that after she broke up with him, McNeal had threatened her and had broken windows out at her home and car.

That woman is not the same person as the victim in the park case, police said.

Court records also indicate McNeal has a criminal history that includes misdemeanor convictions for criminal trespass and theft.

He was also charged with battery in a 2009 case that he appealed from municipal court to district court.

He eventually pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to time served.
