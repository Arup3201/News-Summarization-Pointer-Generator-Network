The bubble might not have burst but it's shrunk slightly.

Home prices across the five major Australian capital cities dropped nearly two per cent in May, the biggest decline in five years.

The softening will come as a welcome relief to home buyers, with a bullish market swelling property prices by 10.87 per cent over the last year. In another good sign for home buyers, the RBA announced on Tuesday that the interest rate would remain at a record low 2.5 per cent.

Downhill: The Australian property market has begun a 'gradual easing' with a 1.9 per cent drop recorded in May, the first decline of the year

Figures released by property market research firm RP Data show the average home price across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth dipped 1.9 per cent last month, the first drop in the market all year.

Melbourne experienced the biggest declines, dropping 3.59 per cent. Perth boasted the healthiest market of the major capitals - dropping just 0.83 per cent.

Around Australia, only the Darwin and Canberra markets managed to grow - swelling 1.05 and 0.08 per cent respectively.

CommSec chief economist Craig James told MailOnline the dip was a correction in the market following 'unrealistic' and 'unsustainable' price rises over the past 12 months.

'The housing market isn't booming and neither is it slumping,' he said.

'What we've had is super strong demand and not enough supply and we're seeing a gradual softening of prices as more houses are built and there is more choice'

James said trepidation about the federal budget, an unusual smattering of public holidays in April and natural seasonal market forces were to blame for the decline in property prices.

'All the lead up to the budget was negative rather than positive and if you weren't in a particular rush, especially if you were an investor, you'd hold off,' James said.

'The fact this was a new government, their first budget and a possibly harsh budget made people sit back and wait.'

Good news for some: The property figures will please home buyers but owners would prefer the rises to continue

He said the fact that the Easter and Anzac Day long weekends were next to each other in April likely encouraged a number of transactions to be brought forward to March, which led to a 2.3 per cent growth nationally.

The news isn't all bad for people looking to sell, with a new luxury apartment complex in Sydney's Bondi Junction offloading 129 units in the space of four hours on Saturday.
