A promising young football player jumped to his death from 120ft high viaduct after racking up gambling debts online.

Talented Adam Billing, 27, from Liskeard, near Plymouth had been a youth team player with Plymouth Argyle FC but suffered a serious knee injury which hindered his career.

He threw himself from the 120ft high Moorswater viaduct in Liskeard, east Cornwall, in April after spiralling into debt through an online gambling addiction.

An inquest in Truro heard how Adam ran a building business with his
friend Leon Caers.

Mr Caers said that £10,000 of payments had been 
transferred from the firm’s account into Adam’s personal bank account.

In a statement he said: 'For whatever reason Adam had been drawn into a cycle of 
gambling that became more and more costly to him and he felt he couldn’t
approach me or anyone else for help.'

Adam's parents said he had seemed happier after meeting girlfriend Jenny Dodds.

Shortly before his death he sent a heartbreaking message to his mother Karen saying 'I'm so sorry mum - I've let you down again.'

His family said Adam had been 'a fun-loving joker' who became become depressed after his knee injury and an assault in which he had his ear bitten off.

Mother Karen and father Bill said: 'It is our opinion that Adam turned to online gambling after a number of personal circumstances left him at a low ebb and made him vulnerable to the lure of online gambling.

'Unfortunately, within a few weeks, Adam became caught in a vicious circle and could not see a way out.'

Mrs Billing went on to warn others about online gambling.

‘Vast amounts of money can be easily lost, just by clicking a button.

Those who gamble get embroiled, not acknowledging that they are losing real money,' she said.

His parents and sister Shelley paid tribute to Mr Billing, who also 
played for local teams Dobwalls and Liskeard Athletic.

They said: ‘He lived his life to the full, 
packing more into his 27 years than most of us would in a whole 
lifetime.'

The Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon recorded a verdict of suicide.

Earlier this week the government announced plans to toughen gambling laws in a bid to protect problem punters.

The Lib Dems have launched a campaign to clampdown on gambling regulations which were relaxed under the previous Labour government.
