Bebe Stores Inc said it detected a hacking attack on its payment processing system that could have compromised data from cards swiped in its stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands.

The exposed data may have included cardholder names, account numbers, expiration dates and verification codes, the women's apparel retailer said on Friday.

Bebe, which also operates stores in Canada, said the affected transactions were made between November 8 and November 26, the day before Thanksgiving.

Hacked: Bebe Stores Inc said it detected a hacking attack on its payment processing system that could have compromised data from cards swiped in its stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands

Security blog KrebsOnSecurity said on Thursday that hackers may have stolen credit and debit card data from bebe during Thanksgiving and Black Friday.

Bebe, which was founded in 1976 and headquartered in Brisbane, California, is the latest retailer to fall prey to hackers.

Previous victims included Home Depot Inc, Target Corp , Sears Holdings Corp and Michaels Stores Inc.

Bebe said online transactions were not affected. 

'We moved quickly to block this attack and have taken steps to further enhance our security measures,' Chief Executive Jim Wiggett said in a statement on Friday.

The retailer advised customers who used a payment card at a U.S., Puerto Rico or U.S. Virgin Islands store during the time frame to review their account statements for any unauthorized activity.

If they see any unauthorized charges, they should contact the bank that issued the card.

In addition, Bebe said that it is offering free credit monitoring services to customers who made a purchase using a payment card at the affected stores during the specified time frame.

Bebe operates 175 retail stores and 35 outlet stores in the United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Canada.

Company shares, which have fallen by more than half in the past nine months, closed at $2.73 on the Nasdaq on Thursday.
