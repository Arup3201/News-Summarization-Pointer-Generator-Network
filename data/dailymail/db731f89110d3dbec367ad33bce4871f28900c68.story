Archivists in California have unearthed vials of moon dust collected from the Apollo 11 mission, hidden within a warehouse at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 

Each of the 20 vials have handwritten labels on, dated 24 July 1970, and were found inside a vacuum-sealed glass jar on the lab's campus.

Along with the jar was a copy of the 
paper 'Study of carbon compounds in Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 returned lunar samples', published in the Proceedings of the Second Lunar Science
 Conference in 1971.

A total of 20 vials containing moon dust and rocks collected during the Apollo 11 space mission in 1969 have been found abandoned in a warehouse in California. The discovery was made by archivists at the Lawrence National Berkeley Laboratory. It is unknown how long the samples have been there, although handwritten labels date them at 24 July 1970. The vials were found in a vacuum sealed glass jar

The handwritten label on this vial of dust, found in a warehouse at the Berkeley Lab in San Jose, reads: 'Apollo, 11 Rock 1005 Dust Calcinated 24 July 1970'. The sample was collected by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during the Apollo 11 space mission. Samples were sent for tests to more than 150 labs worldwide and should have been returned to Nasa

Lunar soil is the fine layer of the loose rock found on the Moon's surface.

Its properties can differ significantly from those of terrestrial soil.

Lunar soil is primarily created by the breakdown of basaltic and anorthositic rock.

These rocks and particles are left on the moon and caused by meteorites and other interstellar particles crashing into the moon's surface over billions of year.

Earth soil, on the other hand, is formed by molecular oxygen (O2), humidity, atmospheric wind and other biologicial processes.

The name lunar soil is slightly misleading, too, because soil on Earth is defined as containing organic materials, whereas lunar soil was found to contain none.

There is no official definition of what size fraction of lunar soil is classed as' moon dust' - some scientists claim that dust is anything less than 50 micrometres in diameter, whereas others put it at less than 10.

Archivist Karen Nelson made the discovery.

Nelson has worked at the Berkeley Lab's warehouse in San Jose for 17 years and admitted: 'We don’t know how or when they ended up in storage.”

Following the successful moon landing of Apollo 11 in 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin collected and brought back various moon rocks and lunar soil samples.

These samples were catalogued and then sent for tests at around 150 laboratories worldwide.

One of those was the Space Sciences Laboratory in Latimer Hall on the UC Berkeley campus.

After experiments were carried out and the relevant papers published, the samples should have been sent back to NASA.

Instead, the moon dust samples from Berkeley were put into storage and forgotten about.

One of the authors of the 1971 Space Sciences Laboratory paper was Melvin Calvin, a former associate
 director of Berkeley Lab, then known as Ernest O. Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory.

Calvin also won the 1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Nasa's Apollo 11 space mission was the first time humans had landed on the moon. American astronauts  Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the moon's surface on July 21, 1969. During the mission they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material and brought it back to to Earth. The samples were sent to labs across the world for testing

Calvin's paper examined the nature and 
chemical characteristics of the carbon in the lunar samples.

According 
to a biography of Calvin by Glenn Seaborg and Andrew Benson, Calvin 
helped shape NASA’s efforts to search for extraterrestrial life, 
including searching for organic and biologic compounds in the lunar 
samples.

Following the discovery, Nelson contacted the Space Sciences 
Laboratory.

She then
 contacted NASA, who asked for the samples to be sent back.

Yet Nasa told Nelson she was allowed to open the jar to remove the vials first.

Other artifacts found in the warehouse included glass pieces from 
Berkeley Lab’s own glass shop, as well as 140 other pieces of scientific equipment.

Some of the more important items will go on display at 
Berkeley Lab, and Nelson hopes the Smithsonian will be interested in some of 
the others.

She said: 'We’re hoping another institution will
 be able to display them.

'The problem is we don’t have room 
for display or storage.'

20 vials of moon dust dating back to 24 July 1970 have been found during a clear out of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

The vials were vacuum sealed within a glass jar 43 years ago to protect the precious content

The researchers say they have 'no idea' how the vials ended up in a storage
