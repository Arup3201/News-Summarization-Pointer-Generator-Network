Hayley-Eszti Szucs was terrified when she awoke one day to find that she couldn't move

A woman who woke up one day to find she was unable to move or speak has overcome her ordeal and forged a successful modelling career.

Hayley-Eszti Szucs, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, was struck down with a severe case of ME - a chronic fatigue syndrome which affects the brain and nervous and immune systems - on Boxing Day 2011.

The 22-year-old was on holiday in Spain at the time with her boyfriend Alex, who called an ambulance when the left side of her face dropped.

She was rushed to hospital, where Hayley said she was unable to move or respond to the panic around her, leaving her feeling as though she was 'trapped inside my body'.

'My boyfriend, Alex, is Spanish, so were out there visiting his family for Christmas,' she said.

'We'd had a lovely time celebrating, but the day after Boxing Day, I remember waking up and just knowing instantly something was wrong.

'My boyfriend tried to speak to me but he could tell straight away that I was seriously ill.

'I couldn't respond to him at all and the left side of my face began to droop. Alex called an ambulance and I was rushed to hospital. 

'I remember doctors speaking to me and asking me if I knew where I was, but I couldn't say anything to them.

'I had no way of communicating so my boyfriend had to give the hospital permission to carry out tests and investigations.

'It was like I was trapped inside my own body.'

Hayley had to lie in a hospital bed, unable to move or respond to the panic going on around her.

'I wanted to say things and tell people how I was feeling but I couldn't. It was horrible - I could hear people talking about me and asking me questions but it was impossible to respond.

'It was the scariest experience of my life.'

While in hospital, medics carried out a variety of tests, including a brain scan and a lumbar puncture, to determine the cause of her symptoms.

But Hayley's condition stumped doctors, and it wasn't until a year later that she finally received a diagnosis. 

'I stayed in Spain for four weeks, and when I finally started to improve, I just wanted to come home,' Hayley said.

'I was able to speak again, but my movement was still really bad - I had to be carried out of the hospital - and I was experiencing up to 20 seizures a day.

'As my case was so unusual, even the doctors back home were unsure of what was wrong with me, but I was eventually diagnosed with ME via a process of elimination.'

Although she was relieved to finally now the causes behind her condition, Hayley was left feeling hopeless.

Although Hayley has vastly improved she still requires a wheelchair from time to time

'It was bitter sweet to get a diagnosis - I finally had answers but to hear the term incurable was really hard - I hadn't even considered that I wouldn't get better.

'A couple of days after I was told that news it suddenly hit me and I just burst into tears, I didn't understand why it was happening to me.

'I just thought of how I would lose my independence as I would need a wheelchair, and my life would never be the same again, it was awful.'

As Hayley began to come to terms with her condition, she started writing a blog, which now attracts more than 10,000 followers every month.

Hayley says her online diary enabled her to express herself during the tough time.

Although Hayley still battles with her illness she says she is determined not to let it take over her life

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) causes persistent fatigue (exhaustion) that affects everyday life and doesn't go away with sleep or rest.

CFS is also known as ME, which stands for myalgic encephalomyelitis. Myalgia means muscle pain and encephalomyelitis means inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. 

CFS is a serious condition that can cause long-term illness and disability, but many people – particularly children and young people – improve over time.

'The blog was a coping mechanism, as it was a relief to be able to write about what I was going through.

'I started getting some great feedback and to hear I was inspiring others was a big achievement.'

As well as attracting a phenomenal readership, Hayley's blog opened her eyes to the disabled modelling industry. 

'Soon after I started blogging I noticed that you rarely see people in wheelchairs, or disabled models, online or in magazines.

'It made me want to get into modelling - I just thought there was no reason not too.'

A determined Hayley ventured into the industry and was met with huge success. 

'I put myself out there and now I often have stylists and make-up artists inviting me to do shoots with them, and I'm hoping to pursue a professional careers further.

'I also work with Models of Diversity to challenge main stream brands to use more disabled models in their campaigns.'

Hayley says that her ordeal has made her even more determined to succeed and refuses to let her illness prevent her from further success. 

'When I look back on everything I've been through - literally waking up one morning to a completely different world - I'm proud that I've made it through it all.

'ME still dominates my life, but it's not who I am - I'm determined to follow my dreams, and show people that nothing can hold you back.'  

'I'm just showing that my illness won't define me.'
