England Under 21 forward Sammy Ameobi wants to switch his international allegiance to Nigeria.

The Newcastle academy graduate was in Brazil this summer to watch older brother Shola represent the Super Eagles at the World Cup. 

Ameobi senior played 20 times for England Under-21s before making his debut for Nigeria at the age of 31 in November, 2012.

Talented: Ameobi knows it is make or break time in his Newcastle career

He was born in the country but moved to Newcastle when he was five and younger sibling Sammy was born in the city five years later.

However, after making five appearances for England’s Under-21s, Ameobi junior sees his international future with the country of his parents’ origin.

‘It will be a great honour to play for Nigeria,’ he said. ‘I would love it. I have seen how it has been with my brother and the World Cup was a great experience, which I would love to experience and help make sure Nigeria participates in again.’

And the 22-year-old – who has made 39 appearances for United – thanked for his brother for guidance during his fledgling career.‘He has always been there for me,’ he told supersport.com.  

‘Whenever I needed advice, he would volunteer it; and also when I tried to make moves that might have derailed my career, he was quick to pull me back on track. It is great to have a proper professional as an older brother.’

Ameobi is in the last year of his contract at St James’ Park, and he added: ‘I am no longer a kid, I am in the last year of my contract with Newcastle and I have to start it with a bang.

‘I have had a lot of injuries which I am hoping I have gotten over now, so I need to play very well to either get a new contract with Newcastle or be able to make a good move elsewhere.’
