A senior Conservative backbencher has said the return of David Davis to Cabinet would help strengthen the party against Ukip

Tory MP and former leadership contender David Davies could be the Conservative party's secret weapon to beat Ukip, it has been suggested. 

A senior Conservative backbencher has said the return of the politician to Cabinet would help strengthen the party on its stance on Europe.

Speaking to the Sunday Express, the backbencher, said: 'Appointing David Davis to the Cabinet would be a Mandelson moment for the leadership.

'There are people who don't believe the party is serious about holding an in/out referendum.

'As Minister without Portfolio Davis can say to the electorate 'Trust me, we are going to hold a referendum' and people would believe him.'

A full Government reshuffle following the Euro elections has been mooted.

David Cameron has been urged by Mr Davis to bring forward his promised EU referendum by a year to 2016 in a bid to persuade defectors to Ukip he is serious.

Mr Davis said the policy lacked 'both clarity and credibility' and should be speeded up to allay the fears of voters who have defected to Ukip.

'The Conservative Party has to decide pretty soon where its blue lines are and make them very clear,' he wrote in the The Sunday Times. 

'If we do not grasp this nettle, I can see the Ukip resurgence carrying all the way through to the general election.

'As it stands we appear to be moving crab-like towards a referendum in 2017, without a clearly articulated set of strategic negotiating aims that might make it worthwhile to stay in the EU, or a clear vision of what we will do if the people decide they want to leave.

'Bringing the date forward will signal a greater sense of determination to our European partners.'

He said if Britain decided to leave in the first half of 2016, it will take two years to negotiate and another two years for the new strategy to work.

It has been suggested that David Davies could be the Tory party's secret weapon to beat Nigel Farage's Ukip

European votes were cast on Thursday at the same time as local elections in which Ukip gained 128 seats and made serious inroads into Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat support.

Opinion polls suggest the Ukip vote will be stronger in the European election after a bitterly fought campaign dominated by immigration and contested allegations of racism against Mr Farage.

A victory will intensify questions facing other party leaders as they battle to reassure MPs and activists that the Ukip surge will not derail their campaigns for the general election next year.

George Osborne flatly ruled out an electoral deal with Nigel Farage

Meanwhile, George Osborne flatly ruled out an electoral deal with Nigel Farage, even as he vowed never to ‘belittle’ Ukip voters.

The Chancellor sought to silence talk by worried Tory MPs of an electoral deal with the Ukip leader by insisting the only real choice at next year’s General Election was between David Cameron and Ed Miliband.

Speaking to Tory activists in London, Mr Osborne declared: ‘There will not be a pact.

'For a Conservative Government at the next  election, you have to vote Conservative.’ But the stern warning was coupled with a clear bid to reach out to Ukip voters and win them back to the Conservatives.

Mr Osborne stressed how he ‘respected’ Ukip voters and Mr Farage even if he did not agree with the party’s leader.

He said: ‘The modern Conservative party will never dismiss or belittle the views of the people we aspire to represent.

‘We should show the highest respect for those who go out and cast their vote – and respect too for those who cast their vote for another party, and that includes those who voted foBut Mr Osborne insisted that Mr Farage did not have ‘the answers to the country’s future’.

Despite Mr Osborne taunting Labour over a ‘miserable’ result in last week’s local elections, a new survey by former Tory vice-chairman Lord Ashcroft last night claimed Labour was still on course for a clear General Election win.

The survey of key marginal seats put Labour at 41 per cent – way ahead of the Tories on 29.

The poll found there was an average 6.5 per cent swing to Labour – enough to oust up to 83 Tory MPs and secure what some observers said could be a Labour majority of 70.

Ukip was on 18 per cent with the Lib Dems scoring just eight per cent, based on 1,000 voters in each of  the areas.
