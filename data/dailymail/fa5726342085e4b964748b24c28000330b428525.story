A Massachusetts woman has been indicted on two murder charges after the skeletal remains of three babies were found in her filthy home crawling with vermin in September, it was announced today. 

Erika Murray, 31, has been held on $1million bail after pleading not guilty to earlier charges, including fetal death concealment, reckless endangerment, assault and battery on a child and animal cruelty.

Murray's attorney, Keith Halpern, said on Tuesday he's disappointed prosecutors decided to upgrade the charges.

House of death: Three of Murray's children were found dead inside the Blackstone, Massachusetts, home in September  

'There's no evidence that she did anything to cause the death of any of these infants,' Halpern said. 'There's no evidence of how they died.'

Murray's four children, ranging from 5 months to 13 years old, were removed from the house in Blackstone in August and placed in state custody. 

Prosecutors said the 5-month-old and a 3-year-old were found covered in their own feces and had been severely neglected.

Police later searched the house and found the babies' remains hanging in bedroom closets.

Also Tuesday, Murray's boyfriend, 38-year-old Raymond Rivera, who lived in the house, was arrested in Uxbridge and charged with child abuse and neglect related to the two younger children.

Prosecutors said DNA showed he is the father of all of Murray's children.

Rivera pleaded not guilty to two counts of assault and battery on a child, two counts of reckless endangerment of a child, two counts of animal cruelty and one count of illegally growing marijuana. His bail was set at $100,000.

Last month, Rivera tearfully recounted how he lived in the basement most of the time and had no idea what was going on in the rest of the house, but a prosecutor said at his arraignment that Rivera slept with Murray every night in a room near where the younger children were.

On Tuesday, a prosecutor in court quoted a pediatrician as saying that this was the worst case of child neglect she has ever come in contact with in her practice, reported MyFox Boston.

The state Department of Children and Families took custody of four children ranging in age from 5-months old to 13-years-old from the Blackstone home in August. 

The two youngest survivors were found covered in their own feces, malnourished and severely neglected. They did not appear to have ever been taken outside the house.

The remains of the three babies, two of them almost entirely skeletal, were found in the home in September. 

Razed to the ground: The residence was demolished in October after having been condemned by the town

The dead infants were reportedly dressed in diapers and onesies, and stuffed inside bags hanging in upstairs closets. 

The house, which is owned by Rivera's sister, was vermin-infested, with rooms filled with trash, feces smeared on walls, soiled diapers and the remains of several animals.  It has since been condemned and demolished.

It took clean-up crews 90 hours spread over four days of work to clear out Murray's house before heavy machinery was brought in to raze it to the ground.

The clean-up and demolition cost the City of Blacktone just under $30,000. 

Murray's four surviving kids were rescued August 28 after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's home asking for help to quieten the crying baby. The neighbor found the youngest child covered in his own feces.

Neither the baby nor Murray's three-year-old child have birth records and both are severely malnourished. authorities said
