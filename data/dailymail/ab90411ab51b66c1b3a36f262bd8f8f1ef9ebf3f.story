Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has his sights firmly set on finishing in the top-two of the Premier League after closing the gap to just two points on rivals Manchester City.

Louis van Gaal's side produced arguably their best performance of the season to blow top-four rivals Tottenham away in a dominant first-half display.

Following Manchester City's shock defeat by Burnley on Saturday evening, United are within touching distance of Manuel Pellegrini's side with nine games remaining.

Carrick, who was instrumental in Sunday's win at Old Trafford, says United are now aiming to catch their city rivals.

'We have got to aim for second,' the midfielder was quoted as saying by the Manchester Evening News.

'We're within touching distance now. You look at the table now and it is so tight. But I suppose really we've just got to look to next Sunday.

'It sets us up for another big game at Anfield. Every game is important now. There are going to be ups and downs because that is how it is, especially in the last nine or 10 games.

'Hopefully when that pressure kicks in, and it goes up and up, then we perform even better and we're going to have to in the weeks to come.

'For this club the Champions League is the place to be isn’t it? We had been in it for so long and not being involved on the big nights makes you realise what it is all about.'
