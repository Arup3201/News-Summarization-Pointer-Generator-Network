Spanish police have said an increasing number of migrants are risking their lives by hiding above ferry engines in a bid to get to new lives in Europe.

A pair of stowaways, aged 29 and 31, were caught this week after making the 20 mile journey from Tangier to southern Spain, just inches from the engine of a ferry.

The pair were caught a week after a Moroccan man risked his life by balancing on a narrow metal platform above the propulsion system of a ferry.

A Moroccan man risked his life by balancing on a narrow metal platform above the engine of a ferry last week

Omar Iziel, 20, had put on a wetsuit and managed to clamber into position before the ferry set off also from Tangier to the port of Tarifa, in the southern Spanish province of Cadiz.

Two hours later after clinging on despite the cold and the rise and fall of the ship, the ferry arrived in Tarifa.

But as the ferry reversed in order to dock, border guards spotted the stowaway and were waiting to arrest him when he swam ashore.

Police confirmed the Moroccan man did not have an entry visa and he was arrested and jailed, pending being deported back to Morocco.

Spanish police spokesman Martial Portillo Alfaro, 43, said: 'It was incredibly dangerous and if he had slipped it would have meant certain death.

'Yet it is an increasingly common way for people to try and enter the country, in fact this was the 31st person caught trying this trick so far this year.'

Police released the video of the failed attempt to warn people that they knew about the stunt, and that vessels are being checked each time as they start to come into port

Alfaro said: 'The disadvantage of this way of travel apart from being deadly is that they can't jump and swim to shore until the vessel stops otherwise they risk being sucked into the propellers.

'That makes it relatively easy to catch them once the vessel has docked.'
