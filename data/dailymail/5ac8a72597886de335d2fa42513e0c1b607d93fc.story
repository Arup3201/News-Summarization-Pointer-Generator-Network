Sixteen-year-olds could be allowed to vote in the referendum on Scottish independence as part of a compromise deal being prepared for the country’s First Minister Alex Salmond.

David Cameron could make the offer to the Nationalists on the condition that Mr Salmond respects the ‘red line’ that the referendum will ask  a single, ‘in or out’ question.

Negotiations between the leaders over the constitutional future of the United Kingdom will continue when they meet next month.

Anti-separation politicians at Westminster have been emboldened by a poll showing a post-Olympic bounce in favour of keeping the Union.

The poll, unveiled yesterday by the Mail on Sunday, showed 60 per cent of Scottish voters now oppose independence.

Just 27 per cent said they backed plans to separate from the rest of Britain – compared with 52 per cent in 2006 – while 13 per cent were undecided. 

The Scottish National Party has demanded that 16 and 17-year-olds should be allowed to vote in the referendum.  It hopes to cash in on stronger support for separation among younger Scots.

But lowering of the voting age – currently 18 for elections – needs approval by the Electoral Commission.

Downing Street sources said they were also ‘relaxed’ about granting Mr Salmond his demand that the referendum is held in 2014, the 700th anniversary of the Battle Of Bannockburn, a decisive victory for Scotland over England.

Unionists fear the SNP could achieve ‘separation through the back door’ by asking multiple questions on independence or further devolution, rather than offering a simple ‘in or out’ choice.

Mr Salmond is known to favour a ‘devo max’ fall-back, which would give Scotland more tax-raising powers and autonomy without full independence.

But a Westminster source said: ‘There should not be any need for a referendum on more devolution.’
