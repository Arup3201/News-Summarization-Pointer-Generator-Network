Jailed: Mark Gore Gore admitted falsely imprisoning the 21-year-old woman in his home but denied kidnapping her with sexual intent

A man who tried to persuade a female 
job seeker to try on sexy underwear after he had lured her
to his home for a job ‘interview’ has been jailed for a year.

Mark Gore, 38, masterminded an 'elaborate ploy', including a string of fake personalities and meetings, to 'sound out' the 21-year-old for sex after spotting her CV that she had handed to a pub.

Gore, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, clearly had a ‘sexual motive’ for what he did and 'lied through his teeth' to meet his lascivious goal, Judge Jamie Tabor QC told Gloucester Crown Court.

Posing on the telephone as a recruiter called 'Colin', Gore told the woman that he had the power to offer her work in local pubs, hotels or a strip club that he was working for.

Impressed by his claims she agreed to meet him at a hotel for an 'interview', to which he turned up under the guise of Colin's boss, Mark Jefferson.

'You told lie upon lie... [creating] an impression that you were interviewing her and other people for employment,' said the judge.'You sounded her out, I am quite sure, to see if she was willing to undertake a role that might have a sexual element to it.

'This was an elaborate ploy. It was 
not a last-minute thought. You had seen her advert looking for work the 
day before and you set about luring her to the hotel and then to your 
home.'

Satisfied with the first 'interview', Gore called the woman again to arrange a second one in October last year.

He picked her up in his car and told her he had to pass his home to make some phone calls.

She earlier told the court: 'He said he had two reception jobs on 
building sites, he had bar work in Cheltenham and he also ran a strip 
club in Birmingham where he needed a manager and a PA.

'I went in with him but I was a bit suspicious and nervous by this time.

'I was stood in his kitchen while he was on the phone making calls. On the table was a bag and he asked me to look in it.

'There was lingerie in there. There 
was a pink basque, a red top that was quite lacy and things for the 
arms. I got a bit scared then. He asked me if I would try this stuff on 
and I said no.

'I said I didn’t feel comfortable and I
was a bit scared and wary. He asked me how he could make me feel more 
comfortable. I said, "You can’t".

'He then approached me and he went in for a kiss. I turned my head but he leaned in and kissed me.

'I was scared. I didn’t know what to do with myself. I was in shock.

'He realised I was not going to give him a kiss and then it changed. He asked me if I wanted to go home and he took me back.

'He said to me that I had passed the test and I had got the job. '

Gore admitted falsely imprisoning the woman in his home but denied kidnapping her with sexual intent. His pleas were accepted by the prosecution.

But because Gore denied the woman’s claim that he tried to kiss and seduce her, a ‘trial of issue’ was held for Judge Jamie Tabor QC to decide which version of the facts he believed.

After hearing from the woman and from Gore, the judge said he accepted everything that she said and found that Gore had been ‘lying through his teeth from start to finish.’

As well as the jail term the judge made an order banning Gore from contacting the woman or her mother.

Giles Nelson, defending, told the court that as a result of publicity of the case Gore had been attacked and beaten up and had to receive hospital treatment last week.

He pointed out that as soon as Gore knew he had upset and frightened the girl he desisted and drove her home.

'This was a very unusual offence,' said the barrister. 'It was in a period of his life when he was experiencing a series of problems in his life and depression.

'Although what he did was elaborate it was very unsophisicated.'
