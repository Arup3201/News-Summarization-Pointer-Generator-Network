Brooke Hiestand, a member of Winona State Warriors, said: 'She was the person that held us together, and if you had something that you didn't know what to do...for some reason, she always knew the answer...always.'

Police investigating the death said they haven't found a single witness to explain how the gymnast ended up dead in a food elevator.

Fountain City Police Officer Jason Mork said he had interviewed half of the customers and employees at the WingDam Saloon and Grill in Wisconsin on Monday night. 

Autopsy results are still pending, but officers have not found any indication that her death was caused by foul play.

Chief Mork said the dumbwaiter's opening is about 3ft by 3ft and the service elevator connects the first and second floors. 

Police said she was trapped in the small elevator when they arrived.  

Miss Baures, an accomplished athlete, was twice named the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference gymnast of the week this year and documented her athletics career enthusiastically on social media.

She was described by friends and family as a 'strong, determined, and beautiful young woman' at the candlelit vigil held on the University campus.

The college paid tribute to Baures who was an accomplished member of the gymnastics team from 2011 to 2014. 

'She was a leader on the team and a talented gymnast,' said WSU athletic director Eric Schoh in a statement. 

'This is a tremendous loss for our community, and we ask that you keep Brooke and her family, friends, coaches and teammates in your thoughts.'

The 21-year-old was found dead at The WingDam Saloon & Grill in Fountain City at 8pm on Monday 

Amanda Schabacker, manager at WingDam Saloon & Grill, told the Winona Daily News that the restaurant would be closed on Tuesday and refused to offer any more comment. 

Photographs posted to social media show Brooke and her family happily posing for pictures at Warriors games. 

The 21-year-old was also a huge music fan and on her Facebook page posted a picture on November 22 with herself and country music stars Dan + Shay along with the caption: 'OMG OMG'.

Tributes from distraught friends have been flooding onto social media since her death was announced on December 1.

Friend Annelie Schmittel posted: 'Thoughts and prayers go out to the family of my former student Brooke Baures, as well as my WSU Warriors family. Devastating news.'

According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, dumbwaiter accidents are rare. 

According to the OSHA database, only two incidents, both fatal, have happened in the U.S. between 2003 and 2013.
