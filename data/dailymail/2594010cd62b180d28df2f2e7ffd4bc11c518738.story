An ancient stone monolith that has stood for more than four millennia has had an enormous smiley face painted on it by vandals.

Historians were furious at discovering the protected Neolithic stone at the Brecon Beacons National Park in South Wales had been defaced with spray paint cans.

The Maen Llia standing stone was erected in the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age between 2,500 and 1,800 BC, experts believe.

The iconic 12ft tall standing stone has stood in the Welsh hills since then undamaged - until vandals daubed an enormous smiling face across it.

The recognised site of national archaeological importance attracts visitors from around the world - and it is believed to be roughly as old as Stonehenge.

Devin and Marge Lemming, of Chicago, Illinois, said: ‘We were driving past and had to take a look.’

The married couple added: ‘It’s staggering it has survived so long. This country has such great history - but why does someone try to spoil it? It’s a real shame someone had to try and ruin it.’

Brecon Beacons National Park Authority is working with Cadw, the Welsh Government’s historic environment service, and landowners to arrange for the graffiti to be ‘sensitively removed.’

Officials said the graffiti removal will be a slow and careful process undertaken by professionals.

Natalie Ward, heritage officer for Brecon Beacons National Park Authority, said: ‘The heritage of the National Park is the legacy left to us by our ancestors.

The Maen Llia standing stone stands in an isolated spot of the Welsh moorland.

It is 12ft high, 9ft wide and 2ft thick - and it is thought that up to a third of the stone is below ground level.

The monolith is visible from some distance and it could have been a territorial marker or have pointed out an ancient track.

One legend says that the stone moves to drink in a river whenever a cock crows.

‘It contains a wealth of information about past peoples and their lives. The person who did this may well think it was harmless fun - but archaeological sites like Maen Llia are fragile.

‘Causing damage to a scheduled ancient monument is a criminal offence. Criminal acts like this can cause irreversible damage.

‘Heritage sites and monuments belong to all of us. We inherited them from our ancestors and it’s important that we take care of these sites to pass on to future generations to enjoy.’

Police are investigating and confirmed that causing damage to a scheduled ancient monument is a criminal offence.

The stones of Stonehenge in Amesbury, Wiltshire, were believed to have been raised in about 2,500 BC by the native inhabitants of late Neolithic Britain.
