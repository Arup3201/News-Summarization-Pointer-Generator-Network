After a night of celebrating the South Sydney Rabbitohs' first premiership win in 43 years, Russell Crowe took to Twitter to blast the CEO of the team's major sponsor, calling him a 'pelican'.

Crowe's rage is said to have come after he noticed a newspaper report that claimed Chief Executive Officer of Crown Resorts Rowen Craigie backed rival team the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs to win the grand final. 

Crowe took to Twitter at around 6am on Monday to attack his  billionaire mate James Packer's staff member.

'Rowen Craigie needs to start looking for another job. You pelican,' the Gladiators star wrote.

But it seems his quick temper may have caused him to react too soon.

Couldn't be prouder: Russell Crowe was elated as his beloved South Sydney Rabbitohs won their first premiership in 43 years against the Bulldogs at ANZ Stadium in Sydney on Sunday night

Russell Crowe sent this cryptic tweet at around 6am on Monday morning 

The Financial Review reports that Craigie was misquoted when he appeared to back the Bulldogs to win. 

Craigie allegedly told The Daily Telegraph’s business columnist Scott Rochfort: 'This is going to be a repeat of the Sydney Hawthorn upset. So we’re going to see two in two weeks.'

However, Craigie told Daily Mail Australia: 'I was barracking for South on the night and all of us at Crown are delighted about the Grand Final result.

'Comments I made before the match about a Canterbury upset were just a reference to a possible upset given Hawthorn's victory over the Swan's last week in the AFL.'

On Sunday 50-year-old Crowe was seen whooping and cheering as the 80,000 strong crowd erupted into jubilation following a history-making performance by the team.

He broke into a grin and threw his hands up in the air when the Rabbitohs beat the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 30-6 at Sydney's ANZ Stadium.

Crowe is close friends with the Crown Resort's chairman Packer and the company's logo features on the team's jerseys.

Following the win, Russell hailed the contribution of his players and staff, and said it was a night he would never forget. 

'I would say it's a pretty good night,' Crowe said.

'There's deep deep satisfaction, this is a team sport and there has been a lot of people involved over the last nine years and a lot of effort gone in.

Crowe also tweeted the results of the game to his 1.58 million followers

'It's a grand reward for those who stepped up to the plate and said we weren't to put up with Souths being a losing club any more.'

Crowe hailed the impact Sam Burgess has had on the club since his arrival in 2010 with the rugby-bound Englishman winning the Clive Churchill Medal despite playing the whole game with a shattered cheekbone.

'I met him he was 20 years old and he had this ambition and I noticed what that level of ambition was,' he said.

Elated: The Noah star couldn't hide his joy as he was interviewed after the game

'I call him the sparkly-eyed man. He can be hard as he wants on the football field but gracious off of it.

'He's carved his name deep in the history of rugby league.'

Crowe helped restore the club to being one the the game's superpowers 12 years after they were readmitted back into the competition.

Since being readmitted, they remained largely at the bottom of the ladder until 2007 when they made the semi-finals for the first time sine 1989.

Sunday night was the first time the Rabbitohs have played the grand final in 43 years.
