The American Psychological Association has refused to punish one of its members for assisting in the torture of a 9/11 terrorist suspect at Guantanamo Bay.

Leaked documents show that Dr John Leso, now a retired US Army reserves, instructed prison staff on ways to obtain intelligence from detainees including Mohammed al-Qahtani, the twentieth 9/11 hijacking suspect. The methods were so severe even Pentagon officials called them 'torture'.

Methods included forcibly hydrating Qahtani though IVs and then not letting him use the bathroom. They also subjected him to loud music, made him bark like a dog and deprived him of sleeping saying he can go to bed 'when he tells the truth'. 

But in an APA letter obtained by the Guardian
 from December 31, they decided they 'cannot proceed with formal charges
 in this matter. Consequently the complaint against Dr Leso has been 
closed'.

Fact: Leaked documents prove that Dr John Leso aided in the torture of a suspected terrorist at Guantanamo Bay

The APA doesn't deny that Dr Leso took part in the torture, but says his actions didn't meet the burden of 'direct unethical conduct' since he was a noted critic of the military's intelligence gathering approach.

Leso and colleague Major Paul Burney were the authors of an interrogation handbook of sorts - a memorandum called 'Counter-Resistance Strategies which advised on how to best get information from prisoners.

'All aspects of the [detention] environment should enhance capture shock, dislocate expectation, and support exploitation to the fullest extent possible,' one section read.

Exonerated: But the American Psychological Association ruled last month that they will not carry out charges against Leso, one of their members. On the left, Mohammed al-Qahtani, the terrorist suspect he helped torture. On the right, a detainee being interrogated at Abu Ghraib

But Leso and Burney distanced themselves from the document during a Senate panel in 2007, saying they were' not comfortable with the memo they were asked to produce'.

Prior to that, just a month before logs show he aided in the interrogation of Qahtani, Leso was in a Guantanamo meeting in which he said that detainee abuse may not prove fruitful.

'Force is risky, and may be ineffective due to the detainees' frame of reference,' he said in October 2002. 'They are used to seeing much more barbaric treatment.'

These occasions of noted discomfort are what the APA are using to defend their move in exonerating Leso.

'Available evidence in the public domain also includes that, in the face of pressure from the highest levels of the Bush administration which strongly supported ‘enhanced’ interrogation tactics, the respondent sought consultation and argued against such approaches and in favor of rapport-building approach,' wrote Lindsay Childress-Beatty, the deputy director of the APA’s ethics office, in the December 31 letter.

The APA's decision has not been popular among other psychologists who believe this breaks their 'do no harm' rule.

Trudy Bond is the Ohio psychologist who complained about Leso's work at Guantanamo to the APA and said their decision sends the message that 'psychologists are free to violate our ethical code, perhaps, in certain situations'.
