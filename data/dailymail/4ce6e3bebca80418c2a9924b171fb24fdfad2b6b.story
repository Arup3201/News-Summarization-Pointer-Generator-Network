A footballer with a Premier League 
academy has been charged with the murder of a 15-year-old girl who was 
stabbed at a house at the weekend.

Andrew Hall, 18, who plays for Stoke City academy, is accused of killing Megan-Leigh Peat, from Westoning in Bedfordshire.

She died after being stabbed at a house in Ailesbury Road in Ampthill at around 1.30am on Saturday, Bedfordshire Police said.

A police spokesman said that on the 
direction of the Crown Prosecution Service, Hall, of Flitwick, 
Bedfordshire, had been charged with Megan's murder.

She added: 'He is being held in police custody overnight and is due to appear at Luton Magistrates Court tomorrow morning.'

Shortly after Miss Peat's death Stoke 
City confirmed that Hall had been arrested.

Hall plays for the Stoke City 
under-18s team. He scored a crucial goal earlier this year to send his 
team through to the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup.

Tragic: After leaving her tribute to Megan the teenager is led away

Megan was a pupil at 
Harlington Upper School in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. In the 
days following her death friends paid tribute to her.

Chelsie McAneny, 
16, said she shared learning support lessons with Megan at school.

She said: 'Everyone loved her, she was bubbly and popular and she stuck up for everyone, even when she was down.

'She was a party girl, she loved it. You could hear her a mile away. Everyone would say she was a good friend.'
