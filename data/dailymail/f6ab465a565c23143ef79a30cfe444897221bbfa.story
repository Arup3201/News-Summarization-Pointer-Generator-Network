An English football fan is in hospital after a hit-and-run incident in Brazil following England's humiliating last game against Costa Rica.

According to police, Mark Fisher, 25, was taken to A&E at Joao XXIII Hospital in Belo Horizonte suffering from bruises and fractures to his face and arms.

He was injured in a hit and run accident with a motorbike in the early hours of Tuesday morning at the busy intersection of Rua da Bahia and Avenida do Contorno.

This is the shocking moment an English football fan is injured in hit-and-run in Brazil following England's defeat against Costa Rica

Police said the victim was too drunk to explain how the accident happened.

Officers from the 1st Battalion explained they were patrolling the area when they received reports from taxi drivers of a foreigner lying injured in the road who had been hit by a black bike.

In a separate case, a Briton named as Darrell Butterworth, 52, was arrested in downtown Belo Horizonte after allegedly smashing a taxi's windscreen out of frustration when he 'couldn't communicate with the driver'.

The incident happened at the junction of Rua Caetes with Avenida Parana.

The cab driver told police the man had entered his Fiat Sienna but got upset when the taxi driver didn't speak English and couldn't understand where he wanted to go.

Finally, Peter Dodd, 37, was arrested after allegedly urinating in a bucket of beer, throwing the liquid at people who complained and exposing his genitals at passersby in Avenida Getúlio Vargas, in the Savassi district.

According to police, Dodd also threw a lemon at someone's head and was abusive.

He, like Butterworth, was arrested and taken to the Central Flagrant Police station (Ceflan), for further questioning.
