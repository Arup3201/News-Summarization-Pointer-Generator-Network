Nigel Farage was forced to pull the plug on his latest attempt to prove Ukip is not racist, after a steel band refused to play at a bizarre 'Carnival' in Croydon.

The Ukip leader hoped it would be a 'bold and vibrant' event to defy his critics, but organisers were confronted with protesters likening the party to Nazis.

Mr Farage abandoned plans to attend after opponents clashed with party members, the steel band walked out and a Ukip candidate branded Croydon a 'dump'.

Ukip yesterday paid for a full-page advert in a national newspaper insisting it was not racist. 

Today's event, staged in front of a shop window with the slogan 'Love Colour' was a follow-up to a rally Mr Farage held featuring candidates and members from ethnic minorities.

In an apparent admission that the party had to do more to prove it was not racist, the street rally was organised in Croydon.

But Ukip candidates and supporters clashed with protesters and campaigners. Romanians carrying banners about Nazis argued with party members about Nigel Farage's remarks last week about Romanian neighbours.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who sparked controversy with comments about Romanians during an interview on LBC last week, was forced to abandon plans to visit Croydon

The event was supposed to draw a line under recent controversies over comments made by Ukip candidates

Instead the 'carnival' descended into a stand-off between protesters and Ukip members, with journalists looking on

Organisers seemed unprepared for the number of protesters accusing Ukip of being Nazis

Ukip strategists cancelled Mr Farage's visit at the last moment, claiming there was a security threat

Ukip are expected to top the European Parliament elections on Thursday, which Mr Farage says will trigger a political earthquake

Winston McKenzie, a black Ukip candidate in Thursday's election, clashed with black teenagers in a debate over whether he was a leader of the community while also being in the party.

He used a megaphone to make a speech urging people to make Britain great again. Mr Farage was due to attend the event, dubbed a carnival or street party, on Croydon High Street.

In his speech, Mr McKenzie said: 'I want to thank all of the patriotic people in this country who are fed up, let down by the situation.

'I'm sick to death... of hearing the same rhetoric come from the same stale political parties.

'It's time people woke up and realised this country is being disenfranchised.'  

Protesters waved placards branding Ukip the 'modern Nazi party' as they disrupted the street event

Ukip officials struggled to maintain control and eventually cancelled Mr Farage's vist

Ukip council candidate Winston McKenzie tried to shout down opponents on Croydon High Street

Mr McKenzie said Mr Farage would not be attending because as a family man and party leader 'certain situations you have to avoid'

Mr McKenzie said there was no choice but to cancel the event, adding: 'Croydon is unsafe and a dump'

Police officers watched over the peaceful but heated clashes outside the Whitgift Shopping Centre.  

The Endurance Steel band, which included black members, told reporters they were 'embarrassed' to be there because they did not think that people should vote for Ukip. 

Winston McKenzie, a Ukip council candidate in Croydon, tried to silence critics using a megaphone. Standing in front of a Ukip battlebus he addressed a small group of party members.

But as he was shouted down by opponents, it emerged that Mr Farage had cancelled a visit to the town. Mr McKenzie confirmed Mr Farage would not be attending, citing security concerns.

He told reporters: 'He's a responsible family man and political party leader. Certain situations you have to avoid.'

Mr McKenzie added: 'Croydon is unsafe and a dump.'

Protesters told Ukip to 'f*** off' and challenged them over remarks by one council candidate who said comedian and actor Lenny Henry should emigrate to a 'black country'.

At an event on May 7 Mr Farage posed with black and Asian supporters to insist: 'Don't call us racist'

Amjad Bashir, the party’s small and medium size business spokesman, is pictured shaking Mr Farage's hand after telling the rally: ‘Take a look at all the faces and skin colours represented on this stage and tell me Ukip is a racist party'

It came after Mr Farage was condemned by politicians from the three main parties after declaring in a radio interview last week that everyone knows ‘the difference’ between Romanians and Germans. Mr Farage’s second wife Kirsten is German.

The Ukip leader yesterday attempted to backtrack, saying the vast majority of Romanians were ‘good people’.

‘If I gave the impression... that I was discriminating against Romanians then I apologise certainly for that,’ the Ukip leader said on a campaign visit to Ramsgate. He said people would – rather than should – be concerned about Romanian neighbours.

He added: ‘Can we just have an honest appraisal of what has happened to post-communist Romania? Across the whole of the European Union, amongst all 28 member states, 7 per cent of all crime is committed by 240 Romanian gangs.’
