Publicity stunt: Argentine Ambassador Alicia Castro claims the poll will be ignored worldwide

Argentina yesterday dismissed the Falkland Islands referendum as an illegitimate ‘publicity stunt’.

But Alicia Castro, Argentina’s ambassador to Britain, was criticised for her ‘offensive’ comments days before islanders hold their first vote on whether they want to remain British.

The historic referendum, which is being held this weekend, will be overseen by international observers. It is expected to send a clear message to Argentina to keep its hands off.

Britain has insisted that those living on the Falklands – called Las Malvinas by Buenos Aires – have the right to decide which country they want to govern them. Britain triumphed when the two nations fought a ten-week war after Argentina invaded the islands in 1982.

Miss Castro said: ‘This referendum has no legal grounds. It’s not approved, nor will it be recognised by the United Nations or the international community, so this referendum is little more than a public relations exercise.

‘This referendum in no way changes the essence of the Malvinas question and its predictable result will not bring an end to the dispute.’ Miss Castro also warned that UK firms would find it difficult to drill for oil off the windswept South Atlantic outcrop unless there were better ties to the rest of South America.

But Ian Liddell-Grainger, the Tory vice-chairman of the Falkland Islands All-Party Parliamentary Group, said: ‘The Falkland Islands is part of the UK and the population has wanted this opportunity to clarify their position.

‘They want to show the strength of feeling that they wish to stay linked to Britain. It is neither right nor fair for Argentina to keep claiming that the referendum is illegitimate. Argentina would be quite offended if we interfered in their referendums or votes.’

Britain
says the islanders have a right to self-determination, and insists they
be present at any talks with Argentina over the future of the islands, 
but Buenos Aires says the matter should only be discussed by two 
sovereign states.

'The Argentine government has already
dismissed the referendum before it has even taken place, a position 
that runs counter to the universal principles of democracy and 
self-determination,' a British Foreign Office spokesman said.

sees the Falklands' roughly 3,000 inhabitants as foreign implants and 
has compared them to Israeli settlers on land Palestinians want for a 
future state.

'We hope that the outcome of this 
referendum will demonstrate beyond doubt the views of the people of the 
Falklands and whether or not they wish to remain a British Overseas 
Territory,' the Foreign Office spokesman added.

Argentina has ramped up its claims to
the islands, where oil exploration firms are expected to produce their 
first oil in 2017, and last month Argentina's foreign minister visited 
London but did not meet his British counterpart.

Regional trading bloc Mercosur, which
includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, has banned 
Falklands-flagged ships from docking at their ports.

'Oil
exploration is feasible, but oil exploitation is unfeasible ... Imagine
if a spill happens there in some remote islands 8,000 miles from here 
... with no proper link to the continent, without doctors, logistics, 
engineers,' Castro said.

Argentine
hostility has not deterred oil companies. Rockhopper Exploration has 
formed a $1 billion partnership with Premier Oil to pump oil from its 
find north of the islands.
