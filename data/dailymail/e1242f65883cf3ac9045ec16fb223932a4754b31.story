Working hard and drinking hard is a reputation university students seem to thrive on - and Charles Dickens’ son was no different.

When Henry Dickens went up to Cambridge more than 140 years ago, his illustrious father made sure he wouldn’t go thirsty.

In a letter the author posted to the 19-year-old, he arranged for ‘3 Doz Sherry, 2 Doz Port and 3 Doz light claret to be sent down to you’.

Not going thirsty: This letter from Charles Dickens to his son Henry promised the student copious amounts of alcohol, including '3 Doz Sherry, 2 Doz port and 3 Doz light claret to be sent down to you'

A footnote added ‘6 bottles of brandy’ were also on their way to complement his undergraduate lifestyle.

While today’s parents might show more concern about how much their children were drinking after leaving home for the first time, Dickens did have some fatherly advice that remains universal today.

No stranger to the shame of financial woes - his own father spent time in a debtor’s prison - he sent a £250 annual allowance to his son, pointedly describing it as ‘handsome for all your wants’.

He went on to warn: ‘Now, observe attentively. We must have no shadow of debt. Square up everything whatsoever that it has been necessary to buy.

Helping hand: As well as the offer of alcohol and money, Charles Dickens offered a friend ear if problems arose, writing: 'If you ever find yourself on the verge of perplexity or difficulty, come to me'

‘Let not a farthing be outstanding on any account, when we begin together with your allowance. Be particular in the minutest detail.’ Dickens, who had to leave school and work ten-hour days in a warehouse, was also keen to see Henry - the eighth of his ten children - understood the opportunity he was being given by studying at one of the world’s greatest universities.

‘You know how hard I work for what I get, and I think you know that I never had money help from any human creature after I was a child,’ he wrote in the letter, which was sent in October 1868.

But he also offered a friendly ear if problems arose, warmly telling his son, whom he addressed as Harry: ‘If you ever find yourself on the verge of perplexity or difficulty, come to me.

‘You will never find me hard with you while you are manly and truthful.’ The advice seems to have sunk in. After his first year Henry, a maths undergraduate, was awarded one of the principle scholarships at Trinity Hall, worth £50.

Years later, Henry described movingly how his normally reserved father had broken down in tears at the news of his award and told him: ‘God bless you, my boy.’ Sadly, Dickens didn’t live to see whether his investment had paid off as he died in 1870, aged 58.

But his son didn’t let him down. Henry graduated in 1872 was later called to the Bar after studying law at Cambridge as well.

After 20 years in the Common Law Courts he became Common Serjeant of London, a senior judicial appointment at the Old Bailey that he held until 1932.

The anxious tone of Dickens’ letter is a reminder of the righteous anger the novelist felt about the grinding poverty and appalling conditions that working class people lived under - and which inspired much of his work, including David Copperfield and Oliver Twist.

The hand-written note was given to Trinity Hall in the 1950s by one of Dickens’ great-great grandchildren and is held in the College’s Old Library.

It is rarely seen as it is only available to view by appointment but details were released to coincide with tomorrow's 200th anniversary of the author’s birth.

Dr Jan-Melissa Schramm, an English Fellow at Cambridge University, said: 'Charles rescued himself from a possible life of penury and crime by the tireless efforts of his own labour.

'Thanks to the brilliant productions of his prodigious genius, his own children were to enjoy a very different - and much more stable - childhood.'
