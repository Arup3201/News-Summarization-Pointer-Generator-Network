Shaker Aamer with two of his children. He has been incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay for 13 years without charge or trial 

MPs will make a blistering attack today on the US for failing to hand over Guantanamo Bay inmate Shaker Aamer to Britain.

Politicians from all main parties will raise the scandal of the 48-year-old continuing to languish in the prison camp.

Mr Aamer, a father of four, has been incarcerated in the naval facility in Cuba for 13 years without charge or trial.

His supporters in Parliament will use a backbench debate to renew pressure on the White House to keep the promise to free the terror suspect, who lived in South London with his wife and children.

MPs will also question whether the US authorities secretly negotiated to send him to Saudi Arabia to face possible torture – despite repeatedly telling the Government he would be sent back to Britain. 

Meanwhile, Amnesty International will hand a 32,000-signature petition to Downing Street calling for him to be freed.

Saudi-born Mr Aamer is the longest-serving UK resident in Guantanamo and has twice been cleared for release, by the Bush administration in 2007 and by Barack Obama in 2009. 

But redacted documents released under Freedom of Information requests show US officials continued to hold top-level meetings with Saudi ministers which indicate they were discussing sending him to the Arab kingdom instead.

One file reveals that less than two months after US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told then Foreign Secretary William Hague in August 2010 that she ‘welcomed... discussing Mr Aamer’s case’, the US sent an ‘action request’ to its embassy in Riyadh on the subject of ‘engaging Saudi Arabia on Shaker Aamer’.

Another document reveals a meeting in Jeddah in August 2013 between high-ranking US officials and the Saudi interior minister in which Mr Aamer was described as a ‘Saudi citizen with significant ties to the UK’.

The current impasse is embarrassing for David Cameron, who said Mr Obama had vowed to ‘prioritise’ the detainee’s release after White House talks in January.

David Davis, the Tory ex-minister who will speak in today’s debate, said: ‘The intention is to put more pressure on America to keep the promise it made to Britain. 

The senior half of the US administration is saying there is no evidence against Shaker and that he must be released, yet the other half is putting obstacles in the way.’

Cori Crider, a director of legal charity Reprieve and Mr Aamer’s lawyer, said: ‘It is a scandal that he continues to languish in Guantanamo.

‘Bland reassurances that the Obama administration is prioritising his case are no longer enough. We need a concrete timetable for his return home, and we must see answers on why this didn’t happen years ago. 

'For a start, we need to know what happened in secret meetings between the UK and US, and the US and Saudi Arabia – are these indications of an attempt to silence him by handing him over to the Saudi regime?’

Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and married, securing leave to remain in Britain. In 2001 he was detained in Kabul while carrying out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity, his representatives claim.

He was handed to the US military for $5,000 and tortured at a secret ‘black site’ prison. US intelligence insisted he financed Al Qaeda and was a key aide of Osama Bin Laden, a claim he vehemently denied.

He was sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002. Despite being cleared for release, US officials are determined he will be sent to Saudi Arabia, even though there are serious concerns he will face torture.

Mr Aamer’s lawyers allege the intention is to silence their client, who claims to have witnessed abuse in the presence of a British security official.
