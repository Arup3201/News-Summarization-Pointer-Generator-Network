A 75-year-old man accused of running a prostitution ring and promoting crack cocaine use within a New Jersey senior housing complex has pleaded not guilty to his charges.

James Parham was among three arrested amid allegations of on-going prostitution and drug use at the Vincente Tibbs Senior Citizen Building in Englewood.

Standing before a judge on Wednesday Parham declined a public defender to fight the charges, saying 'God is my attorney,' NJ.com reports.

Plea: James Parham, 75, accused of possessing a glass pipe used for smoking crack cocaine and maintaining a nuisance in which people gathered for unlawful purposes pleaded not guilty on Wednesday

'I'm broke right now,' Parham argued his case outside the courtroom. 'If I was promoting prostitution, I'd have money.'

In late April police arrested Parham and his 66-year-old neighbor Cheryl Chaney who faces an additional charge of possessing crack cocaine.

Police also charged 54-year-old Selma McDuffie, a school crossing guard who has now been suspended and banned from visiting the complex, with having a crack pipe.

Chaney and McDuffie, who has since been suspended from her job, are expected in court on June 6.

The arrests came after many elderly 
residents at the home complained about drunks and addicts invading the 
152-unit building. Many were fearful to leave their rooms, police said.

'Essentially, they were prisoners in 
their own building,' Chief Arthur O’Keefe of the Englewood police, told the New Jersey Record. 'I wasn’t going to allow that to continue.'

The Englewood Housing Authority, 
which manages the property serving disabled and low-income residents 
over 62, said they carried out checks on the two residents before they 
moved in.

They met the income guidelines and passed a criminal background check, an official told The Record.

But the residents' concerns sparked an undercover investigation and officials checked surveillance footage to track down the perpetrators.

The federally-funded housing agency
cannot afford private security guards for the home, officials said, and instead, residents must contact police if they have any issues.

But in light of the findings - where people were afraid to leave their rooms after coming face-to-face with addicts and strangers in the hallways - police patrol the building around the clock.

O’Keefe said the police department is
understaffed following injuries to several officers in recent 
weeks but that he has no plans to end the patrols at the Tibbs complex.

'I'm not going to allow the seniors to fall victim again,' he said.

Parham moved to the home in January 2012 while Chaney has lived there since September 2010.
