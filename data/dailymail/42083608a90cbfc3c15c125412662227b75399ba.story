Equestrian Paralympian and gold medalist Joanne Pitt has died at the age of 34

Equestrian Paralympian and gold medalist Joanne Pitt has died at the age of 34, it has been announced today.

Ms Pitt, who had right-sided hemiplegic cerebral palsy, died on Thursday afternoon, the British Equestrian Federation said.

Dressage rider Ms Pitt was being treated for a rare lung condition, according to a statement by the federation and British Dressage.

Pitt, who had recently moved from Huntly in Aberdeenshire to Norfolk, represented Great Britain at the Paralympics in Athens in 2004 and was part of the para-equestrian dressage team that won gold at the 2010 World Equestrian Games.

In a statement on the federation's website, Will Connell, British equestrian performance director, said: 'Jo was a stalwart of para-equestrian dressage and has fought hard over the last year to establish herself once again as a real medal contender for Great Britain.

'Jo made her Paralympic debut in Athens in 2004 and has remained part of the Equestrian World Class Programme ever since.

'On behalf of the whole of the World Class Programme, I would like to extend our condolences and deepest sympathy to Jo's family, fiance and friends at this sad time.

'She will be fondly remembered and missed by the whole of the para-equestrian dressage and World Class Programme community.'

David Hunter, para-equestrian dressage performance manager, said: 'First and foremost, the thoughts of everyone in the GB Para Dressage Performance Squad are with Jo's parents, her two sisters and her fiance Rory.

'It is difficult to comprehend that 10 days ago Jo was her fit and healthy self, training her horses each day and determined to make selection for the European Championships in August.

'She had started the competition season with renewed vigour and only five weeks ago was competing at a major international competition in Deauville, France.

'She had everything going for her. She will be greatly missed and never forgotten.'

Amanda Bond, chief executive of British Dressage, said the dressage community was 'shocked and saddened' by the news.

She added: 'Jo was someone who quietly got on with things and never let defeat or a run of bad form get her down.

'The way she came out fighting this season with renewed vigour should be an inspiration to all; her dogged determination to always improve will be a lasting memory of this special rider.'

Liz Nicholl, chief executive of UK Sport, said in a statement that Pitt made a 'fantastic contribution' to her sport.

She said: 'As a key member of British Equestrian's World Class Programme, we know Jo will be deeply missed and our thoughts are also with her coaches, support staff and team mates.'
