Geoffrey Blore, 82, died after being hit from behind by a Ford Focus near Leominster, Herefordshire

An 82-year-old author died after he was knocked off his bicycle accidentally by a driver who became dazzled by the winter sun.

Geoffrey Blore, an RAF veteran who wrote an acclaimed account of his life as an evacuee, was cycling near his home town of Leominster in Herefordshire when he was hit from behind by a Ford Focus driven by Catherine Jones.

Police cautioned Ms Jones, but brought no charges. She told them she had held up her hands to shield herself from the glare - which may have blocked her view of the pensioner.

An inquest heard Mr Blore, a keen marathon runner, was wearing a high-visibility jacket but no helmet when the fatal crash happened south of Leominster on January 15.

He was airlifted to Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth hospital but died of a severe head injury the same day.

The RAF veteran and father-of-four was the author of Dicky Blood's War, which told the true story of how he was evacuated in 1941 from a working-class Birmingham district to the village of Yoxall, Staffordshire.

Hundreds of wide-eyed Birmingham children who had never left the city descended on the village - which only had 700 residents - causing a culture clash which was at once touching and amusing.

The book describes how he and his friends adapted to life on rural farms, including discovering how watermills worked, and how they coped once they returned to city life.

It was praised by the Evacuees Reunion Association as 'so much more than the average evacuees story... vivid, but very accurate.'

The inquest at Hereford Coroners' Court heard the accident happened at 10am - when the low-lying sun and damp impaired the view of the road.

PC Bill Taylor, of West Mercia Police, told the inquest Ms Jones’ view of Mr Blore would 'have been obscured when she put her hands up to shield her face'.

Other drivers also described the visibility as seriously challenging. Minibus driver Ryan Waygood said he was only aware of a cyclist from about 20 yards away.

Herefordshire coroner Mark Bricknell recorded a verdict of accidental death and said visibility was a significant factor.

Tina Pritchett, who worked at Mr Blore’s Norfolk House residence, described him as a 'perfect gentleman'.
