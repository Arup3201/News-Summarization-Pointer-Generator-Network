A 13-year-old Russian child was found living alone in a filthy cowshed because his parents refused to let him live alongside them, it has been claimed.

When neighbours discovered Vasily Makeyev in the building he was naked and cowering.

The boy, who slept in a bed inside the shed, was almost blind, starving and in a filthy condition.

Alone: Vasily Makeyev, 13, was found naked and almost blind in the barn, located in the Chernyavsky district of Russia's Belgorod region. Police believe his parents made him live alone with their cattle

Neighbours said they often heard 'howls' and 'plaintive cries' from the building at night but did not know of the boy's existence.

The child was barely able to speak and was mentally impaired, according to local reports.

Police said Vasily's parents Andrey, 44, and Maria, 41, made him live alone with their cattle. 

Conditions in the barn were so cold during harsh Russian winters that the child was forced to hug calves to keep warm, it was reported.

Vasily's deteriorated eyesight is thought to be due to the minimal sunlight that entered the shed.

The family's other three children lived normally in their nearby house in the Chernyavsky district of Russia's Belgorod region, close to the border with Ukraine.

It was claimed that as a baby the 13-year-old's parents
refused an offer for Vasily to be put into care as they did 
not want to lose state benefits for looking after him.

A neighbour said: 'We saw Vasily only once - when he was taken away by the police.' 

'The Makeyev family had kept the boy in cowshed  all his life. He was never even seen in the yard by the house.'

The neighbour claimed: 'We have heard the plaintive cries and howls at night. But who knew there was a child in there?'

Another neighbour said: 'We are amazed he was still alive.'

Local reports also suggested that the child's parents threw food into the shed for him. 

The teenager is now in the care of social services.
