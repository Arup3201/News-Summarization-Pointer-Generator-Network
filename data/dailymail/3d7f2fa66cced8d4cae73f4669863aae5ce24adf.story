A Toronto illustrator has launched a Twitter campaign that he hopes will draw more attention to the rising number of missing and murdered native Canadian women across the country.

Evan Munday, who writes and illustrates picture books, is drawing black-and-white cartoons of  the over 1,186 missing indigenous women and then tweeting one sketch to Canada's Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, each day.

He launched the campaign on Monday as a reaction to recent comments Harper made about the number of missing and murdered women in the country, to which Harper responded: 'It isn't really high on our radar, to be honest.'

'Just hearing him say that, it was just such a glib non-answer that it was the catalyst for me doing this,' Munday told CBC News.

Munday hopes his drawings might help bring about a formal inquiry into the matter through the power of Twitter. 

'I hope it's not viewed as offensive,' Munday added to the network.

'Part of it is trying to do a tribute and thinking about them and their lives as I do the drawing.'

The figure of missing women is from the last 30 years. 

Munday is sourcing pictures of the women online and then sketching them in blank ink.

Munday hopes enough people will get behind his campaign that it will 'change the radar' of the PM and how he feels about the issue.

He is the illustrator of the novel Stripmalling, and the author and illustrator of the graphic novel series Quarter-Life Crisis.

Munday is perhaps best known though for the The Dead Kid Detective Agency series.  

He hit headlines in a similar capacity in December during the anniversary of the École Polytechnique de Montréal massacre.

The mass shooting at the university on on December 6, 1989, and of the 28 people shot, 14 were killed.

Munday did portraits of each of the victims in the same style as his missing persons ones and put them on Twitter. 

He told BuzzFeed News that after that the made made him 'think about how violence against women is still happening all the time in Canada, and it effects women of indigenous background disproportionately'.

He also realized that 'many indigenous women’s organizations and activist groups and families of the missing women have called for a public inquiry into this epidemic, and how those calls have fallen on mostly deaf ears'. 

The comments made by Harper that affected Munday were said during the Prime Minister's end-of-year interview with the CBC. 

Harper was asked whether he planned to initiate a formal inquiry into the whereabouts of missing indigenous women, because calls for such had been rejected in the past.

'It isn’t really high on our radar, to be honest,' Harper said.

'Ministers will continue to dialogue with those who are concerned about it.'

Munday told BuzzFeed that, so long as he can source photos of the missing women, he hopes to draw them all, and doesn't care if it takes years.
