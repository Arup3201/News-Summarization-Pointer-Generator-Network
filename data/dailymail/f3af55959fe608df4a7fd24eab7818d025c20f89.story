Michael Treanor, the gambling mogul who wants to turn upstate New York into a Vegas-style resort was shockingly accused of sexually assaulting his sister - but incredibly claimed it was consensual.

Nevele Investor and Claremont Partners CEO Treanor, 48, pleaded guilty to third-degree assault in 2007 after a night out with his sibling, according to a civil lawsuit she filed in 2008.

She accused the married father of three daughters of trying to force himself upon her before they passed out at her New York City apartment and ripping off her pajama bottoms.

'I remember suddenly being shoved across my bed and into the wall on the other side of the bed,' the sister, now 41, said in an affidavit according to The New York Post.

'The knuckles on my right hand smashed into the wall. Michael pulled off my pajama bottoms.'

The pair were drinking at the now-closed Red Rock West Saloon in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood when Treanor became overly-friendly with his sister according to court documents.

The businessman who has put down $1 million to compete with 21 other developers for one of four casino license's being awarded in the Catskill mountains denies that anything illegal happened that night.

He countered that the pair fell asleep and that the encounter was consensual.

He admitted to 'having made intentional contact with the victim in this case recklessly causing injury to her genitals.'

However, his sister told The New York Post that 'I stand by everything that's in those papers...I have nothing to hide.'

After pleading guilty to the lesser offense of third-degree assault in Manhattan Criminal Court - he received a sentence of three years probation and one year of psychological counseling.

He did test positive for cocaine twice during the first year of the probationary period, according to court papers.

The outcome of the civil suit filed against Treanor in 2008 was sealed by the court.

His sister told The New York Post that she no longer speaks to her brother but he is still married.

Treanor, the father of three daughters, ages 10, 15 and 17, who resides in Bernardsville, NJ, is the face of the consortium trying to restore the dilapidated Nevele Grande hotel in the Catskills with a $420 million proposal to turn it into a casino.

The luxury resort closed in 2009, $21 million in debt.

Treanorâ€™s attorney, Joe Tacopina, said the alleged sexual assault was 'a dispute over money, and I believe the allegations were engineered by a financial dispute.

'And he resolved this by deciding not to drag this up by going to trial, and he did so with a plea to a reckless offense. It was not a sex offense.'
