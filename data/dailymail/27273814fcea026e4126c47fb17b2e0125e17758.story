Serena Williams kick-started her training for next year in familiar style as she took part in the the Ultimate Run South Beach on Sunday morning.

The world No 1 was joined by her sister, Venus, in the Miami-based event, and the two stars then took it upon themselves to entertain the crowds with a spot of singing after the race, 

The race, which includes either a five kilometer or quarter marathon option, is a fun-run benefiting the Serena Williams Fund, which supports victims of violent crime. 

Serena Williams took on the 5 kilometer race named after her on Sunday morning in Miami's South Beach

The 33-year-old has a reputation the world over as a fearsome competitor who hates to lose

The 33-year-old made light work of the course and was filmed on a Go pro camera during the race. 

Afterwards, the sisters had just about enough puff left to get up on stage to perform karaoke.

Serena got the idea to host a race after running a 5k in Palm Beach, Florida last Thanksgiving, she told the Miami Herald. 

All money raised from Sunday's event will go to the Serena Williams Foundation  to help underprivileged children

Both Williams sisters took part in the event, with Venus going for a slightly brighter-looking outfit 

Serena's performance was captured on a Go Pro camera held in front of her

'Every year, I do a run for Thanksgiving, the 5K or 10K, to kick-start my training for the year, and last year after running the 5K, I thought, 'Wow, I really should do my charity based on running because it's a really fun way to promote a healthy lifestyle,' she told the Florida newspaper. 

'People love it. You can run, walk, bring your family, it's early in the morning. I love karaoke, so at my race, afterward you can go on the beach, relax, have Gatorade and sing karaoke.

'It definitely helps your endurance on the court,' she said. 'You feel you can run so many miles, you can last three hours, four hours if you need to.'

She added: 'I like running the shorter distances, like 5K. You don't kill your body, but you can still feel part of the race atmosphere.'
