A North Carolina grandfather who disappeared during a New Hampshire vacation after falling, hitting his head and losing his memory has been reunited with his family.

After falling down a ravine during a solitary walk, 72-year-old Hugh Armstrong lost his memory and hitchhiked 1,000 miles to his home state, gradually collecting clues about his life on the journey.

Now safely home after a 16-day fugue, today he told ABC, ‘I'll tell you something, it's very nice to know who you are.’

Reunited: Hugh Armstrong lost his memory after falling and hitting his head in New Hampshire; he then traveled 1,000 miles to his home state of North Carolina and was reunited with his wife, Ellen, on Saturday - 16 days after he disappeared

On July 25, the retired IBM employee decided to go for a walk around a nearby lake.

Armstrong recalled leaving a note saying he’d be back by 9 to have a pancake breakfast with his grandchildren. But he never returned.

The grandfather doesn’t remember falling down a ravine but just recalls waking up after dark with no idea of who he was.

‘The only thing I could remember at that time was I didn't know who I was, but I had to go south and west, so that's where I started going,’ he told the news station.

From there ensued an incredible journey home that will surely thrill Hollywood script writers.

Unable to recall his name, Armstrong hitchhiked and walked 1,000 miles south.

He said a farmer in Pennsylvania or Virginia hired him to help hay. The good Samaritan farmer paid him, put him up, fed him and drove him to Roanoke, Virginia.

Incredible odyssey: North Carolina man Hugh Armstrong hitchhiked and walked 1,000 miles home from New Hampshire in a two-week fugue, without knowing who he was.

A breakthrough then came when he was hitching a lift from a truck driver. After telling the driver that he thought he was from North Carolina, the man started listing towns.

When the driver said Asheville, Armstrong knew that was where he needed to get to.

Another stroke of luck came at a McDonald's when he heard a mother calling for her daughter, Emma.

He remembered that he had a granddaughter named Emma living in Wilmington, North Carolina and began writing her a letter.

He wrote, 'I don't know who I am, but hopefully you will,’ reported ABC. He signed the letter with the initials and date he found on the inside of his wedding ring.

However, he couldn’t recall her address. But watching TV that night he heard someone mention a .410 shotgun which triggered him to remember the number of Emma’s address.

He then scoured a phone book to find the right address. Desperate for someone to recognise him, Armstrong traipsed round parks and shopping malls.

No idea who he was Armstrong was put up for several days by a Good-Samaritan farmer in Pennsylvania, who eventually gave him a ride to Roanoke, Virgina

Sixteen days after he disappeared, he was finally found by a sheriff's deputy, walking along U.S. Highway 70 in North Carolina at 1:30 a.m. Saturday morning. He was about 230 west of his home in Clayton.

'He's my hero. That's just a remarkable feat,' said Deputy Brian Walker of the McDowell County Sheriff's Department following the end of the remarkable tale.

He told officers he didn’t know his name, only his initials, and thought he was around 71-years-old. After using a missing person’s database, officers were able to discover his identity.

At 3.30am his wife, Ellen, then got the call she had been desperate for. After talking to him on the phone, she drove with their daughter to the sheriff's office to take him home.

As soon as Ellen stepped out the car, Armstrong said, 'That's my wife,' the sheriff's deputy recalled.

Ellen Armstrong told ABC that her husband gave them the ‘biggest bear hug’ when they walked through the door.

The retired IBM employee was reunited with his family after he overheard his granddaughter's first name in a N.C. McDonald's, found her in a phone book, and penned her a letter

Not knowing who you are is ‘the worst feeling in the world’, says Ellen.

‘He just had to sit there and hopefully somebody would recognize him. [But] we knew if anybody could find his way out of the woods, it would be him,’ she told ABC. 

Armstrong is suffering from headaches and is more emotional than normal which doctors assure the family are symptoms of a mild concussion.

The family celebrated Armstrong's miraculous return with a small pizza party as they rebuild their lives again.

More than 60 people including volunteers had been looking for Armstrong in New Hampshire, searching the Stinson Lake area day and night and using helicopters, boats and dogs. By July 31, the search was scaled back to a small crew of about five divers who focused on the lake.

'I really didn't expect this outcome,' said son-in-law Craig Black. 'I'm just glad to have him home.'

'He's very, very resourceful,' said his son-in-law Craig Black. 'He's very strong. He just knows how to survive. He knows how to figure out where he needs to go, how he needs to get there.'
