According to the Pittsburgh Tribune Review, the child was left with chest and facial injuries.

Court documents said boy was with his father for the evening, and his mother was asked to come to a house to try and stop the bleeding.

The boy was then taken to the Indiana Regional Medical Center, Pennsylvania, where Conway was spoken to by officers.

There they questioned a 'highly-intoxicated' Conway who said he did 'not see a problem' with letting the boy get behind the wheel.  

According to the paper, Conway was charged with child endangerment, reckless endangerment and two summary counts of permitting an unlicensed driver and permitting careless driving.

He will appear before a District Judge on November 19.
