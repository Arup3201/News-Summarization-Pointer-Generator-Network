Return: Agnetha Faltskog, the former Abba singer, has returned from retirement and stepped back into the global spotlight once more

See that girl, watch that scene, diggin’ the dancing queen, wooow-ooo-oo. Yes, my fellow gnarled pop pickers. Four decades after she sang about Friday nights and the lights being low, an incredible 40 years after she climbed aboard her white platform boots and squeezed into her blue satin knickerbockers, Agnetha Faltskog is back.

Remember Agnetha? She was the blonde one in Abba, the Swedish-born fount of a million male fantasies, the dolly bird who made pale blue eyeshadow a thing long before Adam Ant even thought about it.

Throughout the Seventies, Agnetha was the singer we all wanted to be, the platinum-haired pop star with the plaintive edge to her voice, the arch-deployer of curling tongs and unabashed wearer of spray-on satin catsuits.

Throughout that long, long decade that taste forgot, Agnetha never committed the sin of simplicity.

White lace-up dresses, peek-a-boo all-in-ones, Grecian tunics, Spandex flamenco trousers, capes,  chokers and beany hats? She wore the lot. Sometimes, it seemed, all at once. Glittery headbands and jammy layers of lip gloss? Them, too. We all thought she was the last word in smoky, Swedish glam.

And now the woman who once sang ‘I’m nothing special, in fact I’m a bit of a bore’ has cast off decades of self-imposed seclusion and stepped into the global spotlight once more. So here she goes again, my, my, how can we resist her?

Well, can we?

Remarkably, the 62-year-old, long thought of as the Greta Garbo of pop, has been tempted out of retirement on her estate on the Swedish island of Ekero. She made the decision after hearing a new set of songs written for her by Jorgen Elofsson, the Grammy-nominated producer who has previously worked with stars such as  Britney Spears, Celine Dion and Westlife.

Whatever he did to Agnetha to winkle  her out of her shell, it worked. She has a new single out this week, When You Really Loved Someone.

A new album, her first for nine years, will be released in May. Simply called A, it includes a duet with Gary Barlow.

Can you see where this is going? Some would say straight down the middle of the road on the electro-pop highway to hell.

The duet with Barlow is called I Should’ve Followed You Home, which sounds a bit creepy. Especially for a woman who famously had a stalker, a former boyfriend against whom she had to take out a restraining order.

And although Gary and Agnetha recorded separately, Faltskog has said: ‘I think our voices work so well together.’

Of course, Agnetha is not the only Seventies star making a comeback. David Bowie has just released an album and a single. Fleetwood Mac are back on the road.

Stars: Agnetha, along with fellow members Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, unfurled a seemingly endless parade of pop songs with Abba

Donny and Marie Osmond have just finished a UK concert tour, a musical event that prompted one reviewer to report that their show ‘was so spectacularly dreadful on so many fronts that it set a new benchmark in light entertainment atrocities’.

A reminder, if any was needed, that a tiptoe down the path of return is fraught with peril. Sometimes we like our pop gods fossilised in the past, a lovely fly caught in the amber of our memories.

Often we don’t want them to come back at all, ruining everything by reminding us all of how old we’ve become — and disappointing devotees by being not much more than diluted, lumbago-racked versions of their former glories.

For fans will always compare the older celebrity with their younger selves — and few come off better in the evaluation. It is even worse for Agnetha, who wasn’t just a star, but a member of one of the most successful bands in pop history.

Along with fellow members Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Abba unfurled a seemingly endless parade of pop songs that became hits all around the world.

Famously, they were two married couples when they first topped the charts. After having two children, Agnetha and Bjorn split up in 1979, followed by Benny and Anni-Frid three years later. Yet the break-ups led only to more hits, with the poppier songs of the early years being replaced by more introspective numbers.

Six years ago, Universal Records, estimated they had sold more than 370 million albums — quite staggering. New audiences and Mamma Mia! the musical, launched in 1999, have kept them in the public eye.

So what is Agnetha’s new music like? The good news is that When You Really Loved Someone is going to be a big, big hit.

There are, in the modern fashion, layers of electronic lushness over a moody, bittersweet ballad. It’s  got lots of those swooping, big chord changes favoured by X-Factor contestants.

Agnetha’s voice is as lovely as ever, even if at first you would struggle to recognise it as hers. Then that wistful edge kicks in, for the tender ache in her voice remains intact; she still sounds hurt, as if somewhere along the line she was burned by love and the cinders are still hot to the touch.

The accompanying video is shot in an empty theatre, where Agnetha is sitting in front of a dressing table mirror rimmed with lightbulbs. She looks sad. She looks like Lulu! She is looking at an old photograph, and singing to an actress playing a version of her younger self in flashbacks. What is she singing about?

‘Gee, I made some fashion shockers

‘Wish I hadn’t worn those knickerbockers.’

No, I’m afraid I made that up. Agnetha is singing about love, she is sweating the big stuff. She is going on about soul searching, hearts broken, crying in the dark, time passing and that kind of baloney.

What is going on in flashback? Boy is happy with girl, something goes wrong, boy leaves girl. Are the young couple in the video supposed to be Young Agnetha and Young Bjorn? I think that’s what we are meant to conclude. Young Agnetha puts on a beany hat and looks unhappy.

'There are periods in your life when you
have to take care of yourself, and things happen and you have to be 
alone and have things quiet around you for a while' 

- Agnetha Faltskog

Real Agnetha wanders onto the stage in the empty theatre and carries on singing. And wow. She looks sensational. Nipped-in jacket, wafty chiffon blouse, black sequinned leggings, tight boots. No Spandex, thank goodness. A light touch with the lip gloss. No sign of a catsuit, praise the Lord.

For looking back now at old Abba videos, we can see with hindsight that Agnetha was a blonde with  a bad haircut, a snub nose and terrible clothes sense, but she was so hot. In the old days, men  dissolved into puddles in her presence.

Along with Anni-Frid, who had a darker beauty, they were the It-girls of the pop world. No one understood what these two ‘glamazon’ gorgeous gals were doing with those two hairy little midgets.

And in the end, it was clearly something they wondered themselves.

Style: Throughout the 70s, Agnetha never committed the sin of simplicity when it came to her dress-sense

When Abba ended, Agnetha had a solo career of sorts — a few little hits, nothing major. She married briefly for a second time, then retired to grow crisp breads or something on her island. Not much was heard of her. Until today. In an interview with Swedish Radio’s P4 Extra programme this week,

Agnetha explained that her newly-invigorated musical career was a long process. She never ‘closed any doors’, was impressed with Elofsson’s songs and felt she could not say no.

A recluse? She says not. ‘There are periods in your life when you have to take care of yourself, and things happen and you have to be alone and have things quiet around you for a while,’ she explained.

This situation was not helped by her fear of flying, which followed a traumatic experience during one of the Abba tours. Although she had therapy to deal with that, Agnetha has left the days of live performance behind her, which seems to rule out an Abba reunion any time soon.

Agnetha also cheerfully admitted to taking two singing lessons to get her voice back in shape. She wrote one of the songs on the album herself. It is called I Keep Them On The Floor Beside My Bed.

What?

Slippers? False teeth? Her old platform boots? A pair of axes? A bottle of vodka and a packet of crisps? Two mice in a cage?  Emergency pairs of big pants? The mind boggles.

Miss Faltskog is giving nothing away, so fans will have to wait until May to find out. In the meantime, I really hope the new album does not disappoint. For I can still remember all the lyrics to the Abba hits, that sound as freshly minted today as they were when they were first recorded. It is a big legacy to live up to.

I also remember saving and saving and saving the wages earned from my Saturday job in a hairdresser’s to buy a pair of pink pearlised leather boots just like hers. Please. It was the Seventies.

Yet it would be awful if, at this stage of our lives — for both of our sakes — the new Lulu-alike Agnetha produced something that was just . . . ordinary.
