Most people looking to splash out a seven-figure sum on a home might expect an eight-bed townhouse or a large country property.

But, evidently, life is different in the sought-after area of Mayfair, London.

As this basic, unfurnished home has one bedroom, a little kitchen, bathroom and living room - and is spread across just 461 sq/ft.

This means it is the same size as a large living room in a typical family home and SMALLER than a tube 
carriage on the London underground.

The bedroom of Britain's smallest £1million home located in London's Mayfair. The new owner will also have to pay a £3,000 service charge per year

The rather petite kitchen in the tiny flat. The entire flat is spread across just over 400ft, the same size as a large living room in a standard family home

The flat's living room, which has space for a sofa and a dining table. It is thought this property is the country's smallest £1million home

Anyone interested will have to stump up a £3,000-a-year service charge but they do get a 24-hour porter with the flat.

The property, on the market with Wetherell Estates, has attracted its eye-watering price-tag because of its location.

Nobu, the world famous restaurant, is a few doors down while the Ritz is at the end of the road.

It
 is half the size of a typical new home but, at £1 million, the flat is 
six times the price of the average home property sold in England and 
Wales.

The final room in the property - the bathroom. In other parts of the country, £1million could buy you a large country estate

The sought-after home is located in this block in Mayfair, one of the most expensive areas of the capital and the country, where The Ritz is just down the road

Despite the 
asking price, the flat is expected to get a lot of interest from 
customers wanting to live in the desirable London location.

Peter
 Wetherell, who is managing the sale, said: 'A few years ago you could 
find a property like this for £250,000 but an entry-level one-bedroom 
flat in Mayfair is now £1 million.

'You
 have some wonderful neighbours with this flat. You turn left and it is 
the Ritz and go right and you'll find Berkeley Square with London's 
oldest trees.

'You're right in the heart of Mayfair.

Mr Wetherell said this flat, its listing pictured, would be the first rung on the property ladder for those wanting the 'Mayfair Experience'

'It
 could be a very nice pied-a-terre but I think someone will actually 
live there. It is the first rung on the ladder for the Mayfair 
experience.'

The 
property, on Berkeley Street, demonstrates the incredible position of 
the London house market, with prices going through the roof.

A number of MPs recently conceded they wouldn't be able to buy a home in their London constituency if they were house-hunting.

And
 in some areas prices are going one way, with Wetherell Estates recently
 claiming the price of property in Mayfair could double again over the 
next decade.
