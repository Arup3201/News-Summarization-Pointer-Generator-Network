Frightened passengers on board a British Airways flight have told how they heard their pilot making a Mayday distress call 36,000ft above the Atlantic.

The captain radioed for help when smoke filled the cockpit of the BA plane - and accidentally turned on the public address system.

The Boeing 777 was flying from London Heathrow to New York but had to make an emergency landing at Ireland's Shannon Airport.

The BA flight took off at 1.05pm last Saturday with 220 people on board, the Sunday Express reported.

But just before 2pm the crew spotted smoke filling the cabin.

After putting on oxygen masks they immediately contacted air traffic control.

They switched on the cabin address system, and the start of their Mayday call was heard by passengers.

The flight had to land at Shannon Airport , with those on board told there had been an electrical fault.

Passengers then had to wait seven hours for a replacement jet to JFK airport in New York.

Some wrote about the incident on the The Aviation Herald website, which logs emergency landings.

One user, Lester H, said: ‘I will not fly BA again. Ever.’

Another, Rob Waite, said: ‘I was a passenger on board this flight with my new wife.

‘It was pretty frightening hearing the Mayday call, but [the] flight crew said the PA was accidentally turned on in the hubbub. The descent was controlled and landing heavy but again controlled.

‘Staff at Shannon couldn't have been more accommodating and we were offered free refreshments whilst there courtesy of BA.’

It is believed the smoke was caused by a fan in the cockpit which overheated.

The jet has already been returned to service.

A British Airways spokesman said: 'We flew engineers to Shannon who inspected the aircraft and it was brought back to Heathrow where it was fixed in the following days, and returned to service.

'We apologise to our customers who were diverted into Shannon.

'The diversion was precautionary and we sent a replacement aircraft out to collect customers and get them to their destination as quickly as possible.

'We understand any diversion is frustrating for our customers but we take safety very seriously and will always err on the side of caution.'

Another Boeing 777 - on the same route - made an emergency landing at Shannon Airport on Thursday just an hour into crossing the Atlantic.

Again the cause was a burning smell in the cabin - which is understood to have been caused by a faulty oven.

Readers of The Aviation Herald warned electrical burning was what killed all 229 people on board a Swissair flight over the Atlantic in 1998.

In that case, a fire is thought to have begun in the cockpit and spread to equipment before it could be brought under control.
