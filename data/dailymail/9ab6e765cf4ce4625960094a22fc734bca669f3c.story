In one of the most lucrative real estate sales in New York City history, a photographer has sold his Bowery home for $55 million are purchasing it for a mere $102,000 just four decades ago.

Jay Maisel sold the ornate former bank at 190 Bowery to developer Aby Rosen, according to public court records filed Thursday.

The six-story family home hidden inside an imposing Manhattan building had been mistaken for many as a derelict building.

The impressive 190 Bowery building, a single-family home for photographer Jay Maisel, has been sold for $55 million

Maisel bought the home decades ago and many believed it was actually a derelict building

With graffiti covering the imposing doorway and first two floors, many had believed the building was vacant

Photographer Maisel used his artistic vision to turn the six-story building into a family home, after he bought it for $102,000 more than 40 years ago

As the neighborhood went from tawdry to trendy, brokers and developers aggressively pursued the property. 

The Daily News reports that Rosen already listed the property for sale with Cushman & Wakefield.

Floor plans and pictures published on the site of realtor RFR reveal that inside the building is a quirky family home, with about 35,000sq ft of space, 72 rooms and many features left over from its former life as Germania Bank.

Maisel, who lived in the rambling building with his wife Linda and daughter Amanda, uses the first three floors as gallery space, and once rented out the fourth floor to pop artist Roy Lichtenstein.

While the living areas were described as being 'very artists live here' by NY Mag, which was afforded a rare glimpse inside in 2008, the 1898 building still has many throwbacks to its banking days.

The original vault, said to be the size of studio apartment, is still in the basement; the original copper cage elevator is still used by the family, and it is still possible to make out where the bank teller stations were positioned on the main floor.

The first two floors have 18ft high 
ceilings, and the remaining floors have 11ft high ceilings. The building
 also comes with a pressed tin wall in the dining room, a basement and roof terrace.

The family have their main living space on the top two floors, with all the bedrooms and bathrooms, and a large kitchen for entertaining, on the sixth floor.

When the couple gave NY Mag a tour in 2008 they said that despite the constant cost for its upkeep, they could never imagine selling. 

Estimates for the value of the New York City Landmark property, in the bustling NoHo part of Manhattan, suggest it could sell for about $50 million, the Real Deal reported.

'I fantasize about never having to worry about money again. It would be great to take the money and run. But let's face it, where are we going to go? A three-room apartment?' Maisel said.

Few details, and no guide price is listed on RFR's website, and it has not yet responded to a Mail Online request for further comment.
