This is the moment a pit bull owner whose dogs fatally mauled a 63-year-old grandmother was sentenced to at least fifteen years in prison on murder charges.

Alex Jackson, 31, cast his eyes to the floor in despair as he was handed a the sentence - which could extend to life in prison - after being convicted of second-degree murder for his dogs' attack on Pamela Devitt.  

Mrs Devitt was taking a morning stroll in  Littlerock, California, when four of Jackson's dogs leaped over a fence and attacked her in the street, biting her 200 times.

She was alone, didn't have a phone and no one was nearby. 

By the time help arrived, she had been bitten from head to toe and an arm was severed.

She died from blood loss.

Sentencing Jackson to 15 years in jail, Deputy District Attorney Ryan Williams said: 'His actions in this case show that he has a nearly psychopathic disregard for the lives and well-being of others.' 

Jackson was initially arrested when deputies searching for the dogs discovered a marijuana-growing operation in his house.

He was later charged with murder when Devitt's DNA was found on his dogs' bloody fur.

Prosecutors in Los Angeles County Superior Court sought a term of 24 years to life in prison for the murder and convictions on weapon and drug charges. 

The dogs guarded Jackson's pot-growing operation and he knew the animals were dangerous, Williams said.

And records showed neighbors had complained that his dogs were vicious or dangerous and that the he didn't do enough to control the animals. 

A murder conviction for a killing by dogs is rare.

The mauling of Diane Whipple in the hallway outside her San Francisco apartment in 2001 led to her neighbor's second-degree murder conviction.

A Michigan couple is facing trial on second-degree murder charges for the mauling death of a jogger in July by two cane corsos, an Italian mastiff-type breed, near their home about 45 miles outside Detroit.

To be convicted, it must be proven the accused did something so reckless they had to know it was dangerous enough to kill someone — even without intending harm.

Nine witnesses, including several horse riders and a postal worker, testified about seven frightening encounters. One equestrian had offered to provide free fencing and help Jackson put it up to keep the dogs on his property, but Jackson did not accept the help.

According to Jackson's defense lawyer, Al Kim, the 'nail in the coffin' was that the number of other incidents made it hard to argue that he wasn't aware of the danger the dogs posed.

At trial, Kim conceded Jackson was a drug dealer, but also said he was a dog lover who took in strays that reproduced. While he should have kept closer watch of them, he never intended to hurt someone.

'He's not the evil dude he's being made out to be,' Kim said. 'He feels horrible about this. He's contrite.'
