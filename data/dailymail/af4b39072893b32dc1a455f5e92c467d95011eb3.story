A young family narrowly escaped their burning car when it burst into flames while they were driving - then exploded seconds later.

Stuart Tasker, 26, and his wife Luesa, 23, were travelling back from a friendâ€™s house in Lincolnshire with their young children Amili, two, and 11-week-old Ayda-Mai when they began to smell burning.

Tattoo artist Mr Tasker today described the terrifying ordeal, which his newborn daughter Ayda-Mai 
managed to sleep through.

Fireball: Stuart Tasker took pictures of his burning Ford Escort in Sleaford, Lincolnshire after he and his family only narrowly escaped from it unharmed

At the scene: The Fire Brigade had to extinguish the burning family car that was left as a charred wreck after the explosion

As they pulled up at traffic lights in Sleaford on Sunday afternoon Amili started screaming from the back seat.

He said: 'We had only driven about 200 yards when we could smell something burning - like when you get a hair in a hairdryer.'

Mrs Tasker turned around to see flames coming from the back inches from her daughter's legs.

The couple managed to free their two young girls from their car seats and rushed away as fire engulfed the vehicle.

They turned back to the flaming wreckage of their Ford Escort to see it explode just 10 seconds later.

Mr Tasker was full of praise for his wife, saying: 'I've got to say my wife was amazing because she could have just froze.

But she was just like The Hulk and ripped the belt off my youngest and got her out.'

'We turned around and the car just exploded into a fireball. We were inches from certain death.'

Shocking pictures taken by Mr Tasker show the remains of their charred vehicle.

'Looking back at the pictures afterwards, it brings home the terrifying reality of what happened.'
