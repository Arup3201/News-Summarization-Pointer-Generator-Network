Home Office minister Jeremy Browne told colleagues today they could not be 'half in, half out' of the coalition Government

Liberal Democrats are courting electoral disaster by disowning Government policies such as cutting the welfare bill and scrapping Labour’s 50p tax rate, a senior party figure warned today. Home Office minister Jeremy Browne tells senior colleagues who are scrambling to distance themselves from the Conservatives ahead of the 2015 general election that they cannot be ‘half in, half out’ of coalition.He claimed that if there were only two choices at the election – the coalition Government and the Opposition – ‘the coalition government would win and would deserve to win’.

Mr Browne told the Daily Mail his party would ‘lapse into the opposition comfort zone’ if it started echoing Labour criticisms of a £26,000-a-year cap on family benefits, the reduction of the top rate of tax to 45p and the increase in VAT.Ministers fear Lib Dem activists at the party’s annual conference, which starts this weekend in Glasgow, are set to rebel against key Government policies and may vote to reinstate the 50p rate introduced by Labour weeks before it lost power in 2010.‘The fundamental question for Liberal Democrats gathering for conference is this: are we proud of our Government or ashamed of it?’ Mr Browne said.His remarks will be seen as a rebuke to colleagues on the Left of the party – including Business Secretary Vince Cable and president Tim Farron – who have begun to complain publicly about coalition policies.Conservative ministers suspect both Mr Cable and Mr Farron are flirting with Labour in preparation for a potential Lib-Lab power-sharing pact after the next election.

But Lib Dems on the Right of the party are warning privately that to go straight into coalition with Labour, following five years of sharing power with the Conservatives, would be seen as deeply unprincipled by many voters.

Mr Browne, a close ally of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, said the coalition had been formed in 2010 when Britain was in ‘deep trouble’ and Labour had been borrowing a ‘ruinous’ £450 million a day.The country also faced serious problems thanks to ‘entrenched intergenerational poverty and welfare dependency’ and school standards that had been allowed to fall behind those of international competitors.‘Britain badly needed stable government and a clear-headed economic recovery plan. And - with the Liberal Democrats entering office as part of the coalition Government - that is what we got,’ the minister added.Now the country was ‘part of the way down the road to recovery’ with the economy ‘off its knees and back on its feet’ and the deficit cut by a third, he said. Interest rates have been kept low for homeowners and businesses and more than a million jobs had been created in the private sector. 

At the same time, more than 20 million workers on middle incomes had had their income tax cut as the amount that can be earned tax free has been increased in stages towards £10,000.‘These are all Liberal Democrats successes just as much as Conservative successes. We have stuck with determination to the policies that have made this progress possible,’ Mr Browne said.

‘And the Liberal Democrats have taken 
the lead in Government on policies to help people with the cost of 
living. Tens of millions of workers on middle and low earnings have had 
their income tax cut. Millions of retired people have seen the state 
pension rise by more than inflation.

‘But the Liberal Democrats have not just made the popular decisions. Not everyone likes the cap on welfare, or reductions in military spending, or the rise in VAT to help tackle Britain's debt mountain, but we have supported these policies too. ‘We have been willing at all stages to make the necessary but tougher decisions as well. We have voted through the changes that Britain needed to start on the road to recovery.‘So Liberal Democrats have taken the difficult but correct decisions over the last three-and-a-half years, but now, with the general election approaching, we also need to win the credit we deserve for turning round our country.‘That means Liberal Democrats embracing our role in Government and being proud of our overall record. We cannot be half in Government and half out. We cannot claim credit for the popular policies but pretend the unpopular policies are nothing to do with us. ‘We cannot be in the Government but campaign against the Government at the same time. We cannot lapse into the opposition comfort zone of echoing Labour's policies on 50p tax rates and welfare reform.‘The Liberal Democrat conference is an opportunity to trumpet our achievements, not to amplify the attacks of our critics.’Mr Browne, tipped as a potential candidate in a future Lib Dem leadership race, said the party’s objective in coalition should be ‘to be a more effective governing party than the Conservatives, not a more effective opposition party than Labour’. ‘It is our Government and we need to own it and celebrate it. If Liberal Democrats run down the achievements of this Government we will not deserve to share in the credit for the Government's achievements,’ he added.‘The economic recovery, sticking to Plan A, the new jobs, cutting the deficit, our national renewal - none of these would have been possible without the Liberal Democrats. We have been fundamental to putting our country back on track.’Mr Browne said that as an independent party, it was right for the Lib Dems to stand on its own manifesto.‘But we will only get the credit for our achievements if we unambiguously stand by our record in Government - no foot dragging, no craving the easy gesture politics of opposition, no fence sitting,’ he added.
