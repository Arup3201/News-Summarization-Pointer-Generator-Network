Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane has named just one Premier League star in his Dream XI - with Manchester City's Yaya Toure getting the nod to start in midfield.

Zidane's side is littered with players from his former side Real Madrid and La Liga rivals Barcelona.

In fact, all of the 11 players he has named in his mouthwatering line-up have plied their trade for one of Spain's top two teams during their careers.

Zidane has named Real Madrid captain Iker Casillas in goal ahead of 2014 Ballon d'Or candidates Manuel Neuer and Thibaut Courtois.

Three Real Madrid stars make up the defence with Barcelona's Dani Alves joining Marcelo, Sergio Ramos and Pepe.

Luka Modric partners Yaya Toure in a two-man midfield while Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are chosen to play behind Zidane's fellow countryman Karim Benzema.

Zidane has decided to omit the world's most expensive player in Gareth Bale and £63million-rated Real Madrid superstar James Rodriguez.

The 42-year-old Real B coach has not named a single player from Joachim Low's 2014 World Cup-winning Germany side.
