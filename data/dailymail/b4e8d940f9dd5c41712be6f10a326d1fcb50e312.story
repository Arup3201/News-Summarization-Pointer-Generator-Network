It is perhaps not one of the most pressing fact finding missions she has been faced with.

But with her tumbling locks of blonde hair, one could be forgiven for wondering how American astronaut Karen Nyberg keeps her long hair in such tip top condition while in space.

Now, after she was faced with a barrage of questions asking just that, Ms Nyberg, a mechanical engineer aboard the Expedition 36 to the International Space Station, has given a step by step video demonstration.

She tweeted the video saying: 'I have had a LOT of questions about how I wash my hair in space! Let me show youâ€¦'

She can be seen wrestling some water on to her scalp, battling with a few escaping bubbles.

Then she adds leave-in shampoo which she works into her hair, which wafts and weaves around her head in the gravity free conditions.

Her tools are then stuck to the wall beside her to prevent them from escaping and she towels her hair dry.

She claims the results leave her hair feeling 'squeaky clean'

Ms Nyberg said not a drop of water is wasted - as the water dries from her hair it is collected by the air conditioning system, which turns it into condensate and then into drinking water.

Two astronauts left the International Space Station on Tuesday for a day of maintenance tasks, including installing a power cable needed for a new Russian laboratory due to be installed this year.

Veteran NASA astronaut Christopher Cassidy and rookie partner Luca Parmitano, the first Italian to make a spacewalk, left the station's Quest airlock shortly after 8 am as the orbital outpost sailed about 260 miles (418 km) over the Arabian Sea.
