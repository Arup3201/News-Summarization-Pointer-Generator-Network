A teenage model tried to kill herself after a bully from her sixth-form college threw a cup of bleach in her face at a house party.

Victoria Smith, 17, has been trolled online ever since she was attacked by Rebecca Morris, who thought that she was responsible for getting her expelled from college.

The victim, who models under the name 'Toria Melody', was temporarily blinded by the assault and has since become depressed and is forced to wear a wig.

Morris, 18, appeared at Hull Crown Court for a sentencing hearing today, and was told she is likely to face jail over the attack in August last year.

The court heard that Morris had invited Miss Smith to a party in Hull in a bid to take revenge after she was expelled from Wilberforce Sixth Form College, where the two girls both used to study.

As Miss Smith tried to leave the gathering Morris followed her and threw bleach in her face, shouting: 'There is your shot of bleach instead of your shot of vodka. That is for getting me kicked out of college.'

The victim got bleach in her eyes, causing 'excruciating pain' which could have been worse if a friend had not quickly poured Coke in her face to reduce the burning.

Last month, Morris pleaded guilty to unlawfully and maliciously casting or throwing a corrosive fluid, with intent to burn, maim, disfigure or disable or to do some grievous bodily harm.

Today the court was read a victim impact statement from Miss Smith, in which the aspiring model told of the agony she had suffered since the attack.

Stephen Welch, prosecuting, said: 'She felt scared and frightened and she thought she would never see again. She was left temporarily blind for a moment and says the attack caused her a lot of pain and suffering.

'She said her eyes continue to be blurry and she has the vision at six metres a normal person would have at nine metres.

'Her eyes continue to be dry and her hair was damaged. It immediately went green and began to fall out. It went streaky and continued to fall out. She now wears a wig.'

Miss Smith has refused to return to college, stopped modelling and given up her dreams of attending university since the attack, the court heard.

'She says she is a prisoner in her own room,' Mr Welch said. 'She is scared of other people also attacking her. She says she continues to face bullying from friends of Rebecca Morris.

'She says she has received messages on Facebook calling her an attention seeker and laughing about her hair, calling her fat and saying what they want to do to her.

'She used to be a model before the attack but now says she cannot model anymore. She has lost her confidence. She believes that everyone hates her and she no longer wants to be here anymore.

'A month after the attack Miss Smith was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary after taking an overdose. She says she still feels suicidal and does not know how to cope.'

Miss Smith is now suffering from depression and sees a psychiatrist once or twice a week, the barrister added.

The victim said in a previous hearing that she was bullied for seven years all through school, and was only starting to regain her confidence at the time of the bleach assault.

Judge David Tremberg will sentence Morris next Monday. The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
