A British oil rig worker in Indonesia heard his young wife die from a ruptured heart valve while she was receiving treatment in Shetland, 7,000 miles away.

Darron Smith, 35, was working on the rig off Batam Island when he got a phone call from his mother to call home urgently as his 37-year-old wife Anna had been taken ill.

Over the next 24 hours she was transported to Gilbert Bain Hospital on Shetland in preparation to be taken to Scottish mainland for specialist care, but her condition rapidly deteriorated.

Knowing she was unlikely to survive, Mr Smith stayed on the phone while medical workers fought to save her life - and eventually heard them telling his mother the tragic news that she had died.

Despite the trauma of hearing his wife die over the phone, Mr Smith is actually pleased that even though he had been in Indonesia at the time, he had a presence during the last minutes of her life.

'I take comfort in being with Anna in her last moments - even if it was on the phone and I was thousands of miles away,' he said.

'I heard my mum, Carolyn, say, Is she gone?' and the medical team confirm it... It was distressing, but comforting to be there, albeit thousands of miles away at the end of the phone.'

It took Mr Smith five flights over two days to eventually get back home to Shetland after his wife's death on 23 January 2015. It is understood that she had ruptured a valve after suffering two massive cardiac arrests brought about by a previously undiagnosed heart condition.

'She was a young mother with everything to live for, she was fit and looked after herself,' Mr Smith said about his wife.

Mr Smith spent the time waiting for his flight home downloading psychology books on how to help small children cope with the death of a parent - to better prepare him for helping their only daughter Ava, four, deal with her grief.

'Ava is coping much better than me at times, but children that age have a remarkable way of speaking up and stating what's happened,' he said.

'We will cope with losing Anna in the way Ava finds best,' he added.

Mr Smith is now making memory boxes to help Ava remember her mother when she grows up.

'She will want to know what her mum was like,' he said.

The dental nurse's death has struck a chord with friends, family and hundreds of people who never even met here, with £14,000 being raised in just a few days through a JustGiving fundraising page set up in Anna's memory.

The money will be donated to the British Heart Foundation in order to help other cardiac patients.

A team of heart specialists had been flown to Shetland's Gilbert Bain Hospital ready to transport Anna to a unit on the mainland but she died before she could be stablised for transfer.

The previously healthy young mum died within hours of being admitted to hospital. 

'Anna became ill so quickly they had to put her into a induced coma to prepare her for surgery,.' Mr Smith said.

'Every hospital doctor on Shetland had been put on alert to assist if needed. But she deteriorated so quickly she didn't make it to the operating table,' he added.

'One of the main doctors told me that it was the first time he had seen this happen in more than 30 years in the job,' Mr Smith went on to say.

With his future changed so painfully, Darron is now wondering what he is going to do for employment with the rest of life.

'I have a lovely wee daughter to raise,' hesaid.

'Hopefully, I will find something which allows me to earn a living and be a dad at the same time. But it's early days and Anna has only been gone a month.... I know something suitable will turn up, he added'.
