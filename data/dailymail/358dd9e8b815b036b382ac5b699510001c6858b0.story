David Beckham stole the show on the red carpet at the British Film Academy Film Awards on Sunday evening as he turned up to present an award at The Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden.

The 39-year-old former Manchester United midfielder faced many high pressure moments in his distinguished career but admitted he was apprehensive about his moment onstage, where he was handing out the award for Outstanding British Film.

'I'm really proud to be presenting tonight,' Beckham said. 'Slightly nervous. But excited.'

Beckham now resides in Los Angeles but the former England captain is still revered in his home country.

He represented England on the international stage an incredible 115 times, as well as winning the Premier League six times and the Champions League once with United.

He departed Old Trafford in 2003 for Real Madrid, where he won La Liga in 2007 before signing for Los Angeles Galaxy that same year.

Beckham also had two loan spells with AC Milan and Paris Saint Germain. 

He infamously tore his Achilles tendon playing for Milan, an injury that ruled him out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
