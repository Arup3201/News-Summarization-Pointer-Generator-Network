Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling is one of Europe's best young players who is set for an outstanding future at Anfield, according to manager Brendan Rodgers.

The 19-year-old has enjoyed a brilliant second half of the season with some stellar performances which have propelled him into Roy Hodgson's England squad for the World Cup.

Sterling's form has been a key factor in the Reds winning 11 successive league matches to take them to the brink of their first title in 24 years. Liverpool face Chelsea on Sunday, when avoiding defeat would bring the Premier League trophy closer.

Youth club: Brendan Rodgers rates Raheem Sterling (R) as one of Europe's best young players

Wing man: Sterling has scored 10 goals from wide positions in a sensational second half of the season

'I made a comment last week that I think he's one of the best young players in European football at the moment and I didn't say it lightly or without thinking,' said Rodgers.

'This is a 19-year-old kid at one of the leading clubs in the world, playing in one of the most competitive leagues in the world.

Grown up: The 19-year-old has also matured as a person after some unsavoury incidents earlier in his career

'And if you look around Europe, you look around the Premier League and at some of our rivals around us, there's no young players playing (at that level).

'You go into Europe and into some of the top leagues, the French, the Spanish and the German, there's not many young players playing.

'Raheem is 19; he's scored 10 goals as a winger. He's been assisting goals and showing a maturity way beyond his years.

'Whether he's playing in front of five supporters or 500,000 supporters, he'll still be the same.

'He is just maturing into a wonderful young man as well as maturing as a footballer.

'Hopefully he can maintain that and keep working towards that, which he is doing.

Make us dream! Liverpool are five points clear at the top of the table with three games remaining

'If he can, we've got an outstanding young player here and will have for a number of years.'

At the other end of the scale the 33-year-old Steven Gerrard is driving the side on from a deep midfield role and his significance both in terms of performance and leadership cannot be under-estimated.

'We know what an important player he is for us,' said midfielder Lucas Leiva.

'He drives us on with a lot of positivity and we just have to carry on.'

The Brazil international returned to the side last week because of injury to striker Daniel Sturridge, who faces a late assessment to see if he is able to return on Sunday.

But there was no time to revel in his recall as they ground out a 3-2 win at Norwich and Lucas knows they have to maintain the same mentality for every one of their last three games.

Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard (C) pushes Liverpool on, says Brazilian midfielder Lucas Leiva (R)

'Since the beginning of the season we wanted Champions League, now we have achieved that,' he said.

'The fans have been fantastic, they have the belief we can do something special this season.

'From here, we just have to carry on in the same way, otherwise we can be punished.

There is no easy match here in the Premier League, people probably thought Manchester City would beat Sunderland and so would Chelsea.

'This just goes to show that the Premier League it is hard to play against all the teams.'
