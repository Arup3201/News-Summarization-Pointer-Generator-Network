A series of incredible photographs shows an extremely rare white mother bear teaching her adorable little cub how to catch a fish.

The spectacular white bear decides it's time her little one knew how to catch dinner and leads it to a nearby river.

At just eight months old, the cute albino cub timidly follows its mummy-bear around the rocky edges of the river to learn from the best.

The adorable little white bear cub appeared to be around eight months old and still learning to fish

Although the 7st baby bear goes home empty handed, its expert mother takes home a large salmon for their dinner.

The delightful pictures were taken by Kyle Breckenridge in the Great Bear Rainforest, British Columbia, Canada.

The bears are so rare it is believed this is only the third time a white mother bear and her cub have been sighted together.

Mr Breckenridge, 43, traveled to the huge rainforest on the West coast of Canada from his home in Calgary, Canada.

The white bears, which are also known as 'Kermode' or 'Spirit' bears are thought to have a population of less than 1,000 and are a subspecies of the black bear.

Mr Breckenridge, who works as an accountant, had to travel an hour and a half by paddle boat on the river to see the white bears.

He said: 'It was very peaceful and spiritual experience. This was my third trip into this area of the Great Bear Rainforest and my first white bear sighting.

'Because I had never seen one of these beautiful bears before, it made this trip the best I've ever been on.

'The Great Bear Rainforest always leaves you with a smile, however, this time it was bigger than ever.

'It was amazing to be there as it happened, the mother bear took the lead and done fishing whilst the cub observed and learnt from her.

'The cub would stick close to the mother and would get excited when she caught a fish, both would disappear into the forest to eat for several hours afterwards.

'I couldn't believe my eyes, the mother bear was like a professional at catching fish and the little baby bear watched in amazement.

'Both the mother and cub were very cautious and I made sure I took extra care so I didn't spook them.

'They would even make noises to test the area around them, they do this to find out if there is any danger about.

'It was amazing to watch the bears behave naturally.

'The salmon carcass that she caught will provide vital nutrients that are important to both of the bears.

'The mum will teach the cub how to find food sources for each of the seasons. This cub will become independent of its mother at 16 to 18 months.'

Kyle said both the mother and cub were very cautious so he had to be extremely careful not to spook the pair
