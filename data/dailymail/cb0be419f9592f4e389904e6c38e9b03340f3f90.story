Jailed: Paedophile Paul Emsley, 47, was sentenced to 18 months in prison at Burnley Crown Court

A convicted paedphile who was once filmed having sex with a 12-year-old boy has been jailed for a third time after police found a sickening child-abuse themed board game under his bed.

Paul Emsley, 47, was caught when police visiting his home discovered a stash of child porn images along with the game - which involved participants pretending to be children and performing sex acts on each other.

Officers also found drug paraphernalia in every room and a camera and video-enabled mobile phone, which Emsley was barred from possessing under the terms of a lifetime sexual offences prevention order (SOPO).

Emsley, formerly of Padiham, Lancashire, was jailed for 45 months  in 1999 after having sex with a young boy before threatening to kill him if he told anyone what happened.

He was jailed again for two-and-a-half years in 2012 for breaching the SOPO, after he was caught downloading hundreds of child porn images at his home.

And in 2013 he was fined by magistrates for possession of a video or camera-enabled mobile phone, Burnley Crown Court heard.

In the most recent incident, police visited the 47-year-old's home on May 10 on a matter unrelated to his SOPO.

There they found a phone capable of taking videos and Emsley's sick collection of child pornography.

The court heard that the stash included 24 images on a CD and seven images on a VHS tape - with the banned images interspersed with legal homosexual pornography. 

Six or seven of the illegal images were classed as category A - the most serious kind - and depicted penetrative sex involving children. 

Judge Jonathan Gibson sentenced Emsley to 18 months in prison for one count of making indecent images, and two months for the second count, to run consecutively. 

Restrictions: Emsley was banned from having any unsupervised contact with a boy under 16 years old or living in a house with a boy aged under 16-years-old, at Burnley Crown Court (above)

He also revoked the earlier SOPO, and issued Emsley with a fresh order. He is now prevented from having any unsupervised contact with a boy under 16 years old or living in a house with a boy aged under 16. 

Emsley is also prohibited from possessing a computer or device capable of searching the internet, unless the device is surrendered to the police or probation service for inspection, and on the condition that he does not clear the search history on the device.

Emsley had earlier admitted to breaching his sexual offences prevention order and two charges of making indecent images.

Judge Gibson said Emsley had 'expressed some insight and some ambition to a future that does not involve the activity that has brought [him] time and time again before the courts'.
