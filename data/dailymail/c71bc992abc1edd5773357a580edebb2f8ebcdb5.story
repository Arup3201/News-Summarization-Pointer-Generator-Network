After paying $16 to file a one-page claim to an empty, $340,000 home in an upscale Dallas suburb, Kenneth Robinson moved in furniture, hung a 'No Trespassing' sign in the front window and invited television cameras inside for a tour.

But after eight months of defending his use of what he claimed was a little-known legal loophole, Mr Robinson's time in the house ran out Monday.

Bank of America wants possession 
after foreclosing on the home last month, and a judge on Monday gave 
Mr Robinson until February 13 to appeal or move out.

McMansion: Kenneth Robinson took advantage of a little known Texas law to move into this $340,000 abandoned home in Flower Mound, Texas on June 17

Rather than wait to be 
evicted, he slipped out before sunrise on Monday, skipped a morning 
court hearing and refused to say where he was moving next.

'It's been a huge learning experience,' he said in a phone call with reporters.

Mr Robinson quickly turned into something of a 
local celebrity, creating a website, http://16dollarhouse.com, where he 
sold an e-book and offered training sessions for would-be squatters.

On the website, he describes 
himself as a savvy investor who's part of a 'paradigm shift' in which 
people have taken over abandoned homes. Last June, under a law known as 
adverse possession, he filed a claim in court promising to pay taxes and
homeowners' association fees while living in the house. He kept the 
lawn outside mowed, and the front clean.

Mr Robinson told reporters last week while standing at the front door of the two-story, 
3,200-square-foot home with a backyard pool. He declined to discuss his 
background or say how much money he made from book sales or seminars 
related to his takeover.

He said he started his website - 
which describes him as 'poised, measured, insightful and wise' - to keep
the media and others from misleading the public about his story.

'They think some bum off the street 
came and paid $15 to get a $300,000 house by filing a piece of 
paperwork,' Mr Robinson said. 'That is not the case. That is the sum of 
what happened.'

Mr Robinson's website says he's not a lawyer and isn't offering legal advice but has done real estate research.

Real estate experts say he's got the law just plain wrong.

Adverse possession statutes can be 
found in most states, said Brian C Rider, a real estate lawyer and 
professor at the University of Texas. Someone who has openly taken 
charge of abandoned land for an extended period of time - using a 
driveway on a neighbour's property, for example - could try to claim 
that land later, he said.

But it takes a long time to establish
those rights, typically ten years in Texas. Until then, anyone trying to
stake claim to a piece of property owned by someone else is just a 
squatter, Rider said.

Arlington, Texas real estate attorney
Grey Pierson said the law is often used to resolve disputes between 
homeowners over driveways, lawns or other property with shared 
boundaries - not to take someone's house.

Paperwork: Mr Robinson did months of research on 'adverse possession', filled out the forms for $16 and claimed he legally owned the home

It's not clear how long the home in 
Flower Mound was empty before Robinson moved in. Its last owner, William
Ferguson, bought the house for $332,000 in 2005 and appeared to run 
into trouble making payments about three years later, according to 
county records. Ferguson did not have a listed phone number, and the 
records don't indicate where he moved.

And while real estate experts and 
authorities say he's misusing the law, Robinson appears to have inspired
dozens of imitators who moved into Dallas-Fort Worth area homes - some 
of which were still occupied by their owners.

Adverse possession statutes can be 
found in most states and are often used to resolve disputes between homeowners over driveways, lawns or other property with shared

According to Arlington, Texas real estate attorney Grey Pierson, it is not often used to take someone's house as in Mr Robinson's case.

Someone who has openly taken 
charge of abandoned land for an extended period of time - using a 
driveway on a neighbour's property, for example - could try to claim 
that land later, however, according to some legal experts.

But it takes a long time to establish
those rights, typically 10 years in Texas.

Until then, anyone trying to
stake claim to a piece of property owned by someone else is just a 
squatter, says Brian C Rider, a real estate lawyer and 
professor at the University of Texas.

County clerks in North Texas said 
they have seen such a spike in adverse possession filings that they've 
stopped accepting the claims without prosecutors' approval. In a handful
of cases, squatters entered homes that weren't abandoned, but left 
empty for a few days.

'We just had people making bad 
decisions, taking a portion of the law and applying it in a way that was
not legal,' Tarrant County clerk Mary Louise Garcia said.

In one case, an Arlington travel 
nurse came home in September to find her locks changed and two TVs 
missing, according to a police report. Authorities say Anthony Brown 
came to the front door and told her that he had claimed the home and she
was trespassing.

When the nurse asked Brown for his 
paperwork, he offered to return the home for $2,000, police said. Brown,
who was arrested in October, does not have an attorney listed and did 
not respond to messages left on his cellphone.

Tarrant County constable Clint 
Burgess said authorities have interviewed a handful of people claiming' adverse possession' who said they spoke to Mr Robinson. The Fort Worth 
Star-Telegram reported Robinson attended a December eviction hearing for
two charged with burglary. Mr Robinson said then he was attending to show 
support for the couple.

He says now that he doesn't want to be an example to others.

'The truth is I don't want people to 
think that they should go out there and do anything based on what I 
did,' he said last week. 'Whether they do it or whether they're not is 
solely up to them.'

Robinson hasn't been charged with a 
crime but police said they responded to several calls from his 
neighbours. One neighbour, Chris Custard, attended Monday's hearing and 
was smiling after the eviction was ordered.

'We're going to throw a party,' he said.
