An investigation has been launched after a group of prison officers went on a night out wearing T-shirts with the words 'We have Madeleine McCann' printed on them.

One of the officers has been sacked and four others disciplined after photos of them wearing the T-shirts were posted online, it has been reported.

The pictures were on Facebook for two months before bosses at Wandsworth Prison, in south London, were alerted.

According to the Metro, the incident led to a prison officer being sacked and four others disciplined.

But a member of staff at the prison told the paper there were some officers who had been involved in the incident but were still working at the prison.

He said: ‘It makes me sick to think just because they work for the prison service that they should get away with this disrespectful behaviour.'

It is a disciplinary offence for officers to bring the prison service into disrepute through social media, according to their code of conduct.

A Prison Service spokesman told MailOnline: 'An investigation has taken place at HMP Wandsworth and appropriate disciplinary action has been taken following an incident concerning a number of prison officers outside of working hours and away from the prison.

'Until the disciplinary process is completed we are unable to comment further.'

Last month police in Portugal reopened their inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance, five years after they controversially shelved the investigation.

The country’s attorney general authorised the move after ‘highly significant’ new evidence was identified by local detectives.

She said ‘new elements of evidence’ and new witnesses justified the continuation of the original investigation.

Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry welcomed the news.

‘We are very pleased. We hope that this will finally lead to her being found and to the discovery of whoever is responsible for this crime,’ they said in a statement.
