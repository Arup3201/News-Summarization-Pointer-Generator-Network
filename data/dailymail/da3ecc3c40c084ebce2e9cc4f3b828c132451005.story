Stephen Lawrence's brother Stuart received a racist threat after it became known he is suing Scotland Yard for harassment

Stephen Lawrence’s brother received a racist threat after it became known he is suing Scotland Yard for harassment.

An obscene message was sent to Stuart Lawrence days after the Mail disclosed he had formally complained about being stopped by police up to 25 times.

The ‘racially aggravated malicious communication’ was sent via the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, which was set up in memory of the murdered teenager. 

It is the first time Mr Lawrence, a 35-year-old teacher, has been targeted directly in the two decades since the  killing, his lawyer Imran Khan said.

The letter or document, received by the trust on January 16, has been passed to police, who have vowed to track down its author.

Mr Khan said: ‘I can only assume this was a result of the publicity that had appeared directly prior. The vast majority of communications are positive and from well-wishers. 

‘There have been a few occasions that somebody has written something nasty or made a threat, and we take every single one of them seriously and they are all reported.’ 

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Police are investigating an allegation of racially aggravated malicious communication, reported to officers on Wednesday, January 16. This is after correspondence was received at an address in Deptford.’ 

Two weeks ago, Mr Lawrence told the Mail he believes he has been repeatedly stopped by police because he is black and explained why he has launched legal proceedings against Britain’s biggest force.

Mr Lawrence alleges officers from the Met have targeted him as part of a sustained campaign of harassment.He said he was moved to act after he was pulled over by two officers who saw him driving his VW Scirocco near his home in Peckham, South London, in November.

He claims they did not give him a satisfactory explanation as to why he was stopped.

Mr Lawrence made an official complaint to the Met and a formal investigation into his allegations is being supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Britain’s top black officer, deputy assistant commissioner Pat Gallan, is said to be ‘deeply concerned’ by the allegations which are being probed by her professional standards unit.

Describing the claims by father-of-one Mr Lawrence as a ‘very serious matter’, the Met said it would not tolerate ‘any form of racism’.

Mr Lawrence’s mother Doreen has told the BBC programme HARDtalk her family has been targeted because of their stance on racism.

She said: ‘People out there are still very angry, just the name of Stephen brings their anger.’ She told the broadcaster she has warned her surviving son to be careful.

A-level student Stephen was stabbed to death by a gang of five or six attackers in Eltham, South-East London, in 1993, at the age of 18.

The original investigation failed to solve the case and was dogged by allegations of corruption and racism. Only two of the killers have been convicted.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
