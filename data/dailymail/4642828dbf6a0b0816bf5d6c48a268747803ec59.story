It just had to be him. Again. Proud son of Sunderland, Newcastle ball-boy, Middlesbrough trainee, there are few people more qualified to settle a North-East derby than Adam Johnson.

He did it here in the 90th minute, to the unmitigated delight of the Sunderland fans up in the gods.

Johnson had scored in the last two Tyne-Wear derbies at St James’ Park, both of which ended in 3-0 wins for Sunderland. Neither goal will have felt quite as sweet as this one, though.

Fourth official Kevin Friend was about to hold up the board showing five minutes of added time when Sunderland punished their bitter rivals for committing too many players forward in search of a late winner of their own.

Johnson made the break from a Newcastle corner after Costel Pantilimon had produced a magnificent save to tip Moussa Sissoko’s long-range effort over the bar.

The ball was played wide to Steven Fletcher and his cross was cushioned into Johnson’s path by substitute Will Buckley. Johnson took a touch and then took aim, volleying left-footed past young goalkeeper Jak Alnwick.

For the third season running, the Sunderland bench spilled on to the St James’ Park turf in celebration. In total, they have beaten their bitter rivals four times in a row now, a club record.

For Alan Pardew, the statistics make less happy reading. Just one win in eight derbies and none at home. Worse still, the remarkable revival that saved his job is starting to go into reverse.

Eight goals conceded in league and cup in the space of a week to Arsenal and Tottenham and now this. Next up, it’s Manchester United at Old Trafford on Boxing Day. It would have been pointless wishing the Newcastle manager a merry Christmas.

Gus Poyet, on the other hand, will enjoy his Yuletide after maintaining a remarkable success rate against Newcastle. He scored six goals in 13 games against them as a player and has now won all five meetings as a manager with Brighton and Sunderland. Sir Bobby Robson once described him as the ‘scourge of Newcastle’ and Sunday’s events will only add to the legend.

Yet it all started so badly for the Uruguayan. Anthony Reveillere withdrew after injuring himself in the warm-up, which meant Sebastien Coates was called off the bench at short notice to partner Wes Brown in central defence and John O’Shea switched to left back.

It would have been a difficult enough situation in any game, but even more so amid the white-hot atmosphere of the 151st Tyne-Wear derby. ‘It was a unique, strange back four and we kept a clean sheet,’ said a proud Poyet afterwards.

The new set-up invited early pressure from Newcastle and Lee Cattermole got the pleasantries underway in the opening seconds by upending Daryl Janmaat.

Coates picked up the first of seven yellow cards in total for a foul on Ayoze Perez, quickly followed by Newcastle skipper Fabricio Coloccini for a cynical knee into the back of Fletcher.

At times it felt as though referee Anthony Taylor wasn’t so much writing names in his notebook as checking them off, such was the predictability of the bookings.

Former Sunderland favourite Jack Colback and Cheick Tiote trod a fine line before Tiote was booked for smashing into the back of Connor Wickham and Colback for a nasty late challenge on Jordi Gomez. The latter was lucky not to see red shortly afterwards when the referee chose to ignore another tackle on Seb Larsson and call play back for an earlier, less serious infringement. 

If the transgressions were being committed fairly evenly, Sunderland — without a win in six league games before Sunday — certainly had the best of the chances before half time.

Wickham somehow headed wide from barely a yard out after Johnson’s free kick had found him unmarked at the far post. And when Larsson caught Newcastle off-guard with a superb, first-time pass curled over the top of their defence, Fletcher stretched out a foot to volley past Alnwick but saw his effort come back off the bar.

Steven Taylor hit a post soon after the restart but, painfully for the Newcastle centre back, it was with his face as he headed clear under pressure from Fletcher.

Taylor had lengthy treatment on and off the pitch before returning to a hero’s ovation with a nasty swelling and cut under his right eye that required a ‘couple of stitches’, according to Pardew.

Sunderland wasted another wonderful opportunity in his absence when Gomez nonchalantly placed the ball wide with only Alnwick to beat, and Johnson did likewise after cutting inside Coloccini.

Poyet was ready to take off the former England winger. Considering Johnson’s record in this fixture, what was he thinking? Newcastle sensed it might be their day and surged forward — carelessly so, in hindsight. Pantilimon saved from Perez, substitute Adam Armstrong and then Sissoko in the moments before Johnson struck to send the Sunderland fans into raptures once again.

It was a sickening blow for Newcastle but one they took on the chin. Efforts off the pitch to ease tensions in one of the most passionate local rivalries appeared to have paid off with little sign of the ugly scenes that have marred the fixture in recent years.

No horses were punched in the making of this derby. And that has not always been the case here.
