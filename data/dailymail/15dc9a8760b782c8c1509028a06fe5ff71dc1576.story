Crime lord: Babar Qasam, 35, pictured, led a crime gang which put £1.5million of illegal drugs on the street

Prosecutors have managed to recover just £160 from the leader of a drugs gang who pumped over £1.5million of cocaine and heroin onto the streets of Britain.

Babar Qasam, 35, is serving an 11-year sentence for conspiracy to supply heroin after he was convicted in May. But attempts to claw back his ill-gotten gains have so far produced little.

Police say the large-scale operation allowed Qasam and his gangsters to live 'quite affluent' lives.

But even though officers seized around £100,000 during their investigations, the hearing could only prove that Qasam personally made £63,163 from his crimes.

Officers had used Qasam and his fellow criminals as the faces of a poster campaign to tell residents that 'crime doesn't pay' after they were sentenced to a combined total of 167 years behind bars.

But since Qasam's own assets have dwindled so much, a Proceeds of Crime hearing in Preston, Lancashire, was only able to reclaim £160 - all the money he had access to.

He and his accomplices were caught by a nationwide investigation which seized £200,000 in bank notes, 45kgs of 
cocaine and quantities of heroin and cannabis.

The gang operated in Lancashire, Berkshire, Cumbria and West Yorkshire, distributing drugs which were smuggled into the UK.

Police
 found £51,240 in cash in one of the gang’s Range Rovers. One kilogram of
 cocaine, worth £100,000, was recovered from another home while £18,650 
in cash was taken from a van driven by two of the gang which was stopped
 on the M6.

File under 'C': This haul of cash, seized from a Landrover, totals £51,240

Bundle: This £29,920 was also gathered up by officers

And £29,920
 in cash was seized from a vehicle being driven on the M60 near 
Manchester.

Prosecutors said the arrests represented the 'dismantling of a prominent source of drugs' in the North of England.

Despite the unimpressive total recovered from Qasam, police today pledged that they would target any further wealth he amasses in future.

A spokesman said: 'Where possible 
Lancashire Police will track down illegal assets and we deprive 
criminals of cash and possessions.

'In
 most cases the main motivation of criminals is financial gain and 
therefore this is an area in which we can hit the criminal hardest.

Drugs: Police seized this 1-kilogram stash of cocaine from the gang, worth around £100,000

Pulled over: Investigators move in on a Land Rover carrying cash from a drug deal, which police pulled over

Jailed: Lancashire police posted this billboard after Qasam and his gang were sentenced. Police at the time said it proved that crime 'doesn't pay'

'I
 would also reassure people that if in the future, after paying the 
amount, individuals appear to have further wealth that police believe 
has been the result of crime, they can be brought before the courts 
again to assess any other available assets that can be offset against 
the overall benefits they have accrued from their crimes.'

Five accomplices Tamoor Ahmed, 37, from Slough, Neil Scarborough, 33, Tanveer Fazal, 32, Asrer Khan, 29, all from Preston, and Christopher Farley, 31, from Liverpool have already been made to pay back more than £185,000 between them.

Suhail Vohra, 33, of Blackburn faces a Proceeds of Crime hearing in March.
