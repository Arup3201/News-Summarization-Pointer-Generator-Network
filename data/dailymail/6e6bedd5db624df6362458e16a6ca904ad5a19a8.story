Dealer: Brian Mitchell, 37, was jailed for four years after he admitted supplying heroin and diazepam

A criminal who made heroin deals in an alleyway while his three-year-old son sat on his shoulders has been jailed.

Brian Mitchell, 37, was part of a drugs gang in Blyth, Northumberland, who were caught by undercover officers dealing just yards from a children's Sure Start centre.

The gang of eleven were led by 46-year-old Dawn Brown, who dealt wraps of heroin from a Kinder egg stashed in her bra.

Brown, Mitchell and three others were jailed at Newcastle Crown Court this week, while another six gang members were sentenced for their crimes.

Mitchell, who also dealt diazepam, admitted supplying drugs and was jailed for four years.

The court heard how undercover officers arranged deals to catch the gang after making contact through a heroin addict they found rooting through bins.

They arranged a meeting in a hotel, where the addict used a police officer's phone to set up a meeting.

The gang then carried out a series of deals with the police officers next to the Sure Start centre in Blyth.

Describing on of the deals, made on 1 July 2013, prosecutor Jolyon Perks said: 'She [Brown] arrived at the Sure Start cut, pulled a Kinder egg from her bra and handed over two £10 wraps of heroin.

'The police noticed the Sure Start cut was overlooked by a children's play area.'

Referring to a second deal the next day, Mr Perks said: 'Children were playing next to the cut and she pulled out two wraps and provided them for £20.'

Three
 days later Brown again agreed to meet the undercover officers in the same place, before sending them to her home to finish the deal.

The met one more time a week later, and were later redirecting them to her home to do the deal.

A final deal took place on 9 July, when Brown sent another gang member, Mandy Cranson, 38, to deliver the drugs.

Mr Perks said: 'There were children playing again in the play area that overlooks the cut.

'Cranson pulled out a Kinder egg from the front of her bra and handed over two silver foil wraps of heroin.'

During the sentencing, Judge Jogn Evans said: 'They were
 willing to supply whoever asked for it and they also chose to do a lot 
of the dealing in a place where one might have expected a lot of young 
children.

Closing in: Police in Blyth raided two properties in connection with the drugs gang

'It may be they just didn't care or maybe they chose it deliberately thinking the police might not be attracted to that area.'

Brown was given a sentence of three years and nine months for supplying heroin. Other gang members were jailed for between one and four years, though four received suspended sentences and one was given a community order.

Defence barristers for the gang said they all had drug problems of their own and were dealing to fund their addictions.

After
 the case Chief Superintendent Gordon Milward of Northumbria Police said: 'The action taken was a direct response to concerns 
raised by local residents and what followed was a thorough investigation
 into the drug activity of individuals in Blyth.

'We're
 pleased with the sentences passed, which ensure drug dealers are off 
the streets of Blyth and Northumberland for a substantial period of 
time.

'We are not complacent and we'll continue to respond to concerns and take proactive action.'

A total of eleven gang members were sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court for drug-relating activities:

Brian Mitchell, 37, pleaded guilty to supplying heroin and diazepam. He was jailed for four years.

Dawn Brown, 46, admitted supplying heroin, and has been jailed for three years and nine months.
