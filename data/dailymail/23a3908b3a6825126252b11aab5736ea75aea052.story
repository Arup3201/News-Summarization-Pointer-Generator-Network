A 13-year-old boy who sleeps next to a python is following in his father's footsteps by keeping a close eye on the unusual animal.

Rather than being wary of what the deadly animals might get up to, the father and son share a passion for their snakes.

Bingzhe's pet black python has been in the family for 19 years- they have cared for it since it was an egg.

It it now an impressive four meters long and weighs nearly 100 kilograms. Bingzhe's son cares for the family's albino Burmese Python.

The white python has been a family pet for ten years and even sleeps next to the 13-year-old.

The family, who live in the Guangdong Province of China, insist the animals don't need to hibernate because of their humid climate.

Bingzhe's said: 'We treat them like human beings, so we often talk to them, take them out and even travel with them'.

The man claims the two non-venomous constrictors are very tame and mild and have never attacked humans.

Charmer: The family are rarely without their snakes. They travel with them and talk to them like humans

Pucker up: An intimate moment between the pet and its owner show how loving and fearless the young boy is towards the deadly animals
