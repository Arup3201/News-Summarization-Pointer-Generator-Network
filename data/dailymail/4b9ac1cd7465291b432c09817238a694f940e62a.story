A 23-year-old woman has pleaded guilty to killing her mother on Friday night and refused a lawyer to represent her in court.

Gabriell Woutersz, still in her pyjamas and barefoot, faced the ACT Magistrates Court on Saturday after being arrested at 5.40pm from a home in Dexion Place at Dunlop in Canberra, ACT.

At court she confessed to the murder of her mother, 56-year-old Norma Cheryl Woutersz.

'I 100 per cent did the murder', she told Magistrate Karen Fryar. 

She then  refused representation for a crime she had already plead guilty to.

'I killed Cheryl Woutersz, I don't need a lawyer to represent me, I'm pleading guilty'.

But her defence lawyer suggested Ms Woutersz may suffer from bipolar disorder and discussed with the Director of Public Prosecution options for a mental health assessment.

Ms Woutersz laughed at the Magistrate who attempted to set a date for another hearing.

Two young women sat in court crying, they are believed to be Ms Woutersz friend.

Earlier, police were called to the home, where Norma Cheryl Woutersz's body was discovered. 

Police will not say if anyone else was in the house at the time.

Streets were closed off, while forensic services examined the crime scene.

The 23-year-old remains in custody and is set to appear in court on Tuesday.
