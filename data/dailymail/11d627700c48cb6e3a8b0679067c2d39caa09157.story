The way police dealt with neglect allegations concerning a four-year-old boy, who was eventually starved to death by his alcoholic mother, are to be investigated.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) will examine West Yorkshire Police’s conduct in relation to the case of Hamzah Khan, whose decomposed body was found in a cot at his home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 2011.

The child's severely malnourished and skeletal remains
 were discovered in a bedroom of his 
mother's filthy house nearly two years after he died.

Victim: Hamzah Khan's starved to death by his mother in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 2011

Mother-of-eight Amanda Hutton, 43, was jailed for 15 years last year for Hamzah’s manslaughter, as well as neglecting five of her other children.

At her trial at Bradford Crown Court, it emerged that a range of agencies, including police officers, had contact with her family but no-one spotted the danger the children were in.

The court also heard how Hamzah's father,
 Aftab Khan, raised concerns with officers after he was arrested for 
attacking Hutton, but detectives said the claims were investigated 
and no problems found.

The IPCC said it is now investigating West Yorkshire Police’s handling of concerns raised about Hamzah’s welfare.

It said allegations of neglect had been made to West Yorkshire Police and other agencies prior to the discovery of the youngster’s body and it had contacted the force to ask for details of complaints to police.

Sentenced: Amanda Hutton was jailed for 15 years after being found guilty of manslaughter, after her son's mummified body was discovered two years after he died

The commission said it will examine what action West Yorkshire Police took after concerns about Hamzah’s welfare were raised.

It will also look at why the matter was not referred to the IPCC in 2011.

IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts, who will oversee the investigation, said: 'The death of Hamzah Khan was a truly shocking example of the most cruel neglect imaginable and at the heart of it lies the loss of a young life.

'Our investigation will examine what action West Yorkshire Police took and also why the contact was not referred to us in 2011.'

Police had extensive contact with Hutton and her family over a number of years but mainly because she was a victim of repeated domestic violence.

A serious case review in Hamzah's case published last year concluded that the child was 'invisible for almost a lifetime'.

But the review was criticised by Children's Minister Edward Timpson who expressed his 'deep concerns', saying it had failed to fully explain 'missed opportunities to protect children in the house'.

Squalor: The child's body was found in awful conditions in a bedroom at Amanda Hutton's house

Hutton was living in what the report described as 'breathtakingly 
awful' conditions with five of her young children as well as Hamzah's 
mummified remains when shocked police entered her four-bedroom house in 
September 2011.

A jury found 
she had allowed Hamzah to starve to death in December 2009 and left his 
body in a cot with a teddy.

The
 remains were only discovered due to a police community support 
officer's tenacious pursuit of a minor anti-social behaviour complaint 
because she knew something was wrong.

But
 Hutton failed to co-operate with many children's services.

Detective
 chief superintendent Andy Brennan, head of West Yorkshire Police 
Professional Standards, said: 'West Yorkshire Police referred this 
matter to the IPCC in November last year and they have decided this will
 be an independent investigation which we will fully support and assist 
in any way we can.'

Disgusting: The living room of Hutton's home was covered in old takeaway boxes, bottles and plastic bags
