A 53-year-old man who has sent over $100,000 to a woman he has never met in Nigeria insists he is only providing financial assistance until she inherits $25.6 million from her dead parents.

Steve appeared on Dr Phil to discuss his unusual relationship with 'Kelly' who he met on an online dating website in 2012.

He says the pair are legally married in Nigeria, even though he has never met her and they usually only communicate online. 

Steve, 53, has sent over $100,000 to 'Kelly' a woman he has never met in Nigeria because he believes she will soon inherit $25.6 million from her parents

Steve appeared on Dr Phil to discuss his unusual relationship with 'Kelly' who he met on an online dating website in 2012, then got legally married to her long-distance

Steve says he has been giving her the money for the last few years to help her until she receives her inheritance from her parents - she claims they were killed in an Ohio car crash in 2012.

Steve sells his plasma - a yellowish liquid that has to be separated from blood - twice a week to ensure he can make payments to 'Kelly' who lives with 'James,' her 'attorney.'

'I've sent Kelly about $103,000 in the last 29 months,' he said on the show as a flabbergasted audience listened.

'I've not met Kelly, but it doesn't matter. I love her just the same. 

'She has an inheritance coming, and I've always wanted to be a millionaire, so it's like a match made in heaven.' 

Steve says that when Kelly came back to the US he tried to met her, but it didn't work out. But when Dr Phil's team analysed an email she sent Steve claiming she was in South Dakota, the IP address revealed it was sent from Nigeria

'I just love her. She is very beautiful and warm, kind, caring and loving.'

Steve says he has not met 'Kelly' as she needs to stay in Nigeria to help with signing the inheritance forms.

He said that 'Kelly' came back to the US he tried to met her, but it didn't work out.

But when Dr Phil's team analysed an email she sent Steve claiming she was in South Dakota, the IP address revealed it was sent from Nigeria.

'Kelly' told Steve she went to a nursing school in North Dakota, but when the show contacted the school they said no-one with her name had ever been enrolled. 

But 'Kelly' is not only person Steve is sending money to -  he says he is an accountant, and insists he is on the verge of becoming a multi-millionaire from several pending inheritance deals with overseas clients.

He says he is sending them money to cover their legal fees as they fight to obtain their inheritances.

Steve says he is an accountant, and insists he is on the verge of becoming a multi-millionaire from several pending inheritance deals with overseas clients - he has sent over $138,000 to clients abroad 

But he is now on probation for cashing a fraudulent check that was sent to him from Africa - he was asked to cash it to help a 'client whose life was in danger' and then asked to send $5,000 to five people listed.

However the bank picked up on it and he was arrested. 

Steve's sister, Tammy, says she is worried as he has been scammed in the past.

She is asking him to cut ties with 'Kelly' - and his other so-called clients.

'My brother is delusional,' Tammy says. 

''Kelly' could be a Nigerian man behind a computer.'
