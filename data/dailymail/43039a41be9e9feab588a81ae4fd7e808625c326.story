Formula One tycoon Bernie Ecclestone has revealed that he is in discussions about the possibility of hosting a Grand Prix in Las Vegas.

The last time F1 raced in Las Vegas was in 1982 on a track in the Caesars Palace car park, but due to logistics never got the support to gain any kind of continuity.

However, Ecclestone is now keen for F1 to make a return to Las Vegas, with the route of the track to include one of the city's most iconic landmarks, The Strip, if it went ahead.

The 83-year-old, who has been trying to bring F1 back to Las Vegas for more than 20 years, said on the potential news: 'Vegas say they are ready to go and it would be on The Strip for sure.'

Leading F1 sponsorship agent Zak Brown believes it would be a great move adding: 'Vegas would be a fantastic addition to the F1 calendar and would be successful for so many people involved.

'It's a great fit for the F1 brand and would draw a lot of interest from sponsors in one of the most important strategic markets for F1 - America.

'Vegas as a city would benefit greatly from F1's fan base who no doubt would spent a lot of money that weekend.'
