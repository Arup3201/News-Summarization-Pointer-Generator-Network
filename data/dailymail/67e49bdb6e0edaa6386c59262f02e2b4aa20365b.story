French prosecutors have requested a five to six month suspended jail sentence for Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage following an alleged assault in a beachfront restaurant.

The European Player of the Year, who has been hoping to make a late charge into England's World Cup squad, was arrested last month along with teammate Xavier Chiocci following an incident involving a 30-year-old professional tennis coach.

It has been reported that the victim was left unable to work for 45 days with facial injuries following an incident on December 13, when Armitage was out celebrating Toulon's Champions Cup victory over Leicester.

Armitage denied any wrongdoing and admitted to being 'very inebriated', adding that he did not remember hitting anyone voluntarily.

'I contest the charges against me. I do not remember anything,' Armitage said in court, according to La Provence.

'I was really drunk and feel that I unintentionally fell on the victim, this injuring him but without doing it intentionally.

Armitage (centre) claims he 'unintentionally fell onto his victim' while very drunk and denies any wrongdoing 

'One thing is for certain, I very much regret being drunk; I'm a professional player and as such must set an example.'

The tribunal will make its ruling on February 24 and his club Toulon have threatened to impose internal sanctions on the players.
