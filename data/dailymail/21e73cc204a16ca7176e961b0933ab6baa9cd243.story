A couple who prayed and rubbed olive oil on their sick infant rather than calling 911 for the dying boy have been found guilty of manslaughter.

Dale and Shannon Hickman, both 26, are the latest members of a controversial Oregon faith-healing church to be blamed in a child's death.

Their baby David was born two months early at his grandmother's home and died nine hours later when he had trouble breathing and turned blue.

They cried and hugged tightly after being found guilty following jury deliberations of less than four hours, reported The Oregonian.

David was born with a bacterial infection and underdeveloped lungs and had a 99 per cent chance of survival with medical care, prosecutors said.

Mr Hickman said he didn't call 911 because he was praying. The couple never considered taking the baby to the hospital, prosecutors said.

Shannon Hickman said that she must defer to her husband because of church rules. ‘I think it's God's will whatever happens,’ she testified.

But the couple are only expected to 
be jailed for up to 18 months and their defence lawyer said they were 
victims of religious persecution.

The Followers of Christ church was founded in the 1890s in Kansas but moved to Oregon City in the 1940s.

The
devout followers firmly believe that the power of prayer and the laying
of hands - where ministers lay their hands on believers while 
praying - can cure illnesses.

It’s
thought that some followers secretly visit traditional doctors - but if
found out, they are likely to find themselves ostracised.

The
baby boy died quickly and there was no evidence that medical care would
have saved him, Mark Cogan, defending, told the court.

The Followers of Christ Church has a history of rejecting medical care for children and relying on as prayer and anointing the sick with oils.

Five other church members have been 
convicted in Clackamas County for crimes related to the rejection of 
medical care for their children.

The Hickmans' conviction on 
second-degree manslaughter charges typically requires a mandatory 
minimum sentence of six years in prison.

But because of a religious exemption in 
state law at time of the crime, they will probably get up to 18 months 
in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Clackamas County Circuit Court Judge Robert Herndon allowed the couple to remain free until they are sentenced at the end of October.

In response to deaths among Followers of Christ members, state lawmakers removed the religious defences from criminal laws this year. 

Those exemptions had made it tougher to 
convict parents shunning a child's medical care for religious reasons 
instead of neglect.

The change will allow prosecutors to seek stiffer manslaughter or murder charges in faith-healing cases.

Two other parents from the church were convicted earlier this year for failing to seek medical care for their infant daughter.

She had a growth that could have left her blind in one eye - and they were sentenced to three months in jail.
