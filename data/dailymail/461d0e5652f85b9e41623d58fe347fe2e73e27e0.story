In the age of over-sharing on the internet, photo sites such as Tumblr and Instagram are increasingly awash with glossy, 'food porn' style shots of swanky restaurant meals and elaborate home-cooked grub.

Now though, humble office workers around the world are leading a backlash against gastro meals and posh puds by sharing snaps of their drab and often downright depressing lunches instead.

Photos of 'sad food', including half eaten chicken and greasy looking pizza are taking the internet by storm with pictures of a boring bowl of tinned soup, wilted lettuce sandwich or just a plastic pot of humble vegetable sticks, pictures of ‘sad food' going viral on the blogosphere.

One such dedicated blog site is Sad Desk Lunch, created by Kira Fisher, which aims to show the real side of office eating.

‘62% of American office workers usually eat their lunch in the same spot they work all day,’ says the website.

Users
 have inundated Fisher with pictures of their sad lunches, including a 
measly slice of toast smeared with tinned tuna and cheese on a cracker.

One
 user submitted a photo of herself at her desk, holding a tin of 
pineapple, with the sarcastic caption; ‘Oh, let me just pull lunch out 
of my drawer.’

Fisher, who is based in New York City, started Sad Desk Lunch in 2012 when she was working as a video editor.

'I was staring at my rather 
unappealing lentil soup, which I was eating at my desk, and just thought "I can't believe I eat this gruel 
let alone eat it alone at my desk pretending to work rather than going 
outside or eating with others,"' says Fisher.

'That's where the idea came from. I started the
 Tumblr and started harassing my friends to send me pictures of their 
own sad desk lunches, then it took off and now people from around the 
world submit everyday.

'I'm sitting on probably 500+ submissions right 
now!'

And she’s not the only one getting in on the sad-food-fad.

Sites such as cooksuck.com dedicate pages to boring meals and other social network fans have started tweeting and Instagram-ing their very average cuisine.
