Early pioneer: Gillian McKeith was one of the first people to suggest a complete overhaul of the contents of your fridge as a good way to lose weight

I’m 50 and have spent my life overweight. I’ve done the Atkins and Dukan diets and Lighter Life, which left me bigger. I’m now on the 5:2 Diet but have lost only 5lb in two months. Am I cursed?

You should be proud of yourself for persevering, but it sounds like you’ve fallen into the yo-yo dieting trap. 

The Atkins, the Dukan and Lighter Life are some of the most extreme diet plans on the market, and while this often works in the short term, restricting your calorie intake or cutting out whole food groups leads to fat gain when not on the diet.

On the 5:2 you can eat what you want for five days a week, then restrict your calorie intake to a quarter of what’s recommended (600 for men, 500 for women) on the others. But this is a little misleading.

If what you like eating on the normal days is processed food and sugary cakes and biscuits, you aren’t going to see the results you want. 

Is it also possible you have been treating yourself on these days, due to your disappointment at failing to get to the weight you want?

Eating emotionally is another pitfall, as you’re more likely to reach for high-fat, high-sugar foods to make you feel better.

I suggest a total overhaul of the contents of your fridge and kitchen cupboards. Gillian McKeith was one of the early pioneers of what’s considered a really healthy diet now, and one that will help you shed the pounds effortlessly.

This will mean cutting out all processed foods – that’s anything that comes in a packet or has ingredients that sound like they were made in a laboratory. 

Dairy products, especially cheese, are also restricted. Instead, stock up on fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, organic eggs and other forms of animal protein, and nuts and seeds to snack on.

I guarantee that combining these foods with the 5:2 eating plan, as well as adding some regular exercise (even fast walking) will help you see the results you want.

The Alcohol Education Trust, whose supporters include Carol Vorderman, above, have launched a ‘Dryvember’ sobriety challenge 

Go sober...every month 

Last week I had my first glass of wine in a month - just as ‘Go Sober For October’ was being launched. 

I had been on ‘Sober September’, despite my belief that moderation is better than an all-or-nothing approach. However, my mood definitely improved without a tipple and I felt more focused. 

Now the Alcohol Education Trust – supporters include Carol Vorderman - have launched another challenge called ‘Dryvember’. Perhaps my new approach will be a month-on, month-off.  

Tara Stiles rules in the kitchen 

I love the idea behind a new book by New York yogi and It Girl Tara Stiles. Called Make Your Own Rules Diet, it is divided into three sections – mat, cushion and kitchen – and designed to help you tap into the foods your body really needs with the help of regular yoga and meditation.

The idea is that by taking the time to get in touch with your body, you won’t need to go on a ‘diet’ because you’ll be able to distinguish between real hunger and cravings, and nip emotional overeating in the bud. Tara’s also a vegan, so the recipes in the book are all plant-based – but the message is about finding a healthy approach to eating that’s 100 per cent right for you.
