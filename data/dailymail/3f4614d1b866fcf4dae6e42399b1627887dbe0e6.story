Miracle: Kelly Cays, 22, and her fiance Zach Rose were saved by an anonymous benefactor

A woman whose car was stolen and trashed with her $1,800 wedding dress inside has been saved in time for the big day – after an anonymous ‘angel’ bought her a new gown.

Kelly Cays, 22, was devastated after her Jeep turned up in an alleyway with the all-lace gown missing in her home town of Colorado Springs.

Several women offered her their gowns after the crime appeared in her local newspaper, but the search seemed hopeless because none would fit Miss Cays’ 5ft 1in frame.

She put down a $400 deposit on a new gown, but could not afford the balance because she used all her spare cash fixing her trashed car.

That was until a miracle struck at the bridal shop. Out of the blue, the manager phoned Kelly to tell her a ‘wedding angel’ had paid the $1,400 cost of an identical gown.

Miss Cays – who still has no idea who the mystery woman was – joked she would be sleeping with the dress every night until the big day in June.

She told Today: ‘She said that she had amazing news and that someone had come in and anonymously paid off my dress.

‘I just started crying. I’m so thankful. They don’t even know me, and it was a wonderful thing to do.

‘I’m so, so grateful. If I can find her, she can come to the wedding.’

Miss Cays had received the original gown as a gift from two aunts and chose it because it reminded her of the one her late grandmother wore 60 years earlier.

She and fiancé Zach Rose scoured pawn shops in the hope the dress had been traded, but to this day it has not turned up.

It is far from the first wedding miracle.

In February a newlywed couple in Britain survived a 30ft tree toppling onto their car as they drove from their wedding ceremony to the reception.

Lee True, 36, and his new wife Clare, 40, were driving away from the wedding in fierce winds in their Peugeot 206 when the car buckled under the force of the blow.

Miraculously the pair only suffered minor injuries - while Lee’s two children James, seven, and Charlie, five, and their dog Tilly, walked away completely unharmed.
