A Kenyan government official has criticised Australia for installing 'fear and panic' in tourists wishing to travel to the African country as hundreds of Western tourists were being evacuated following a terror attack.

Kenya's Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ministry Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho's outburst came the day before two bomb attacks in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, on Friday.

At least 13 people are feared to have died in the blast at Gikomba market.

The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a stern warning on Monday to tourists visiting Kenya.

Terror: People scatter in panic as the twin blasts tear through the Gikomba open-air market for second-hand clothes in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Friday

Angry: Kenya's Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ministry Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho expressed disappointment at Australia and Britain's stern warnings about travelling to Kenya

The advice on the government's Smart Traveller website said: 'We continue to advise Australians to reconsider their need to travel to Nairobi and the Mombasa region, including Diani Beach, due to the high threat of terrorist attack and high level of crime.'

And it ruled out travel to border regions with Somalia, Ethiopia and South Sudan, because of the 'extremely dangerous security situation'.

It added: 'Elsewhere in Kenya we advise Australians to exercise a high degree of caution.'

Mr Kibicho responded to the warning on Thursday, expressing his disappointment with the governments of Britain, Australia, France and the United States who have all issued messages to tourists.

Danger: A policeman inspects a damaged van at the scene of the twin explosion at Gikomba market in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Friday

Explosion: Three people were killed and 16 were injured in a bomb attack at a Mombasa bus station earlier this month. Officials have blamed al-Shabab for the incident

'The challenges arising from acts of terrorism require concerted efforts to fight it and not behaving in a manner that accelerates it by causing fear and panic,' Kibicho said in a statement issued in Nairobi.

'Issuance of such travel advisories only plays to the whims of bad elements in society whose aims is to spread fear and panic among otherwise peace loving people.'

However, unlike the British government - who is evacuating its citizens from Kenya - the Australian government is yet to put such strong measures in place.

A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told MailOnline on Friday: 'The level of the Australian travel advice for the Mombasa region and Nairobi is "reconsider your need to travel" (level 3 of 4 levels) and remains under close review.'

Fears: British tourists queue at Mombasa Airport in Kenya after a change in Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice prompted travel companies to bring them home

Protection: Armed guards waited as holidaymakers prepared to board a charter flight following recent terror attacks

Meanwhile, a number of UK travel companies suspended holidays to the nation as tourists were watched in airports under armed guard before returning home.

British tour operators Thomson and First Choice are now bringing holidaymakers home after a change in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) travel advice.

The two companies have cancelled all flights to the East African country until the end of October, while long-haul travel company Kuoni is, for the time being, not offering holidays to the Kenyan coast.

Earlier this month, a bomb attack at a bus station in the coastal city of Mombasa killed three people and injured around 16.

Another explosion also damaged a hotel in the city during rising tensions and a a recent spate of al-Shabab-linked incidents.

Around 100,000 Britons travel to Kenya every year, and many have been devastated by the change in circumstances.

Andy Coughlan was on 'a dream holiday' after with his wife Irene, 53, who was told she had gone into remission after suffering breast cancer.

'We’re absolutely devastated,' Mr Coughlan, 53, told The Daily Telegraph. 'Ren had been seriously ill for a long time and this was the first time after all the chemo that she was ready to travel.

Tour operators Thomson and First Choice have cancelled all flights to Kenya until the end of October as a result of the concerns

'She said she wanted to wait for her hair to grow back. As soon as it did, we were on our way here.'

The couple from Swansea were staying at the luxury Diani beach and had only arrived in Kenya on Tuesday.

The FCO advice reads: 'There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. The main threat comes from extremists linked to Al Shabaab, a militant group that has carried out attacks in Kenya in response to Kenya's military intervention in Somalia.

'There has been a spate of small-scale grenade, bomb and armed attacks in Nairobi (especially the area of Eastleigh), Mombasa, and North Eastern Province.

'You should take care in public places where people gather, and exercise a heightened level of vigilance.'

A spokeswoman for the FCO said: 'We estimate there are 5,000 British nationals resident along the coast and approximately 500 in Mombasa and surrounding area.'

Luxury: The coastal city of Mombasa is popular with British tourists, but many have had their dream holidays cut short
