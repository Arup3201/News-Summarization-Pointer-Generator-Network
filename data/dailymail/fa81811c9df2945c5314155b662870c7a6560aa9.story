Biggles: A real life Major James Bigglesworth has been discovered

For decades, Biggles has held children in thrall with his fictional exploits as a dashing Royal Air Force pilot.

But now it has emerged that his unlikely adventures may have been based on fact – in the shape of a real airman from the First World War.

A 1918 combat report by a pilot called Major James Bigglesworth has been found at the RAF Museum in a collection of papers that once belonged to Biggles author WE Johns.

The full name of the Biggles of the books was exactly the same – James Bigglesworth.

The vital document was kept in the manuscript of a book Johns published in 1953 as Biggles in the Gobi.

The museum’s researchers have been combing through their files to find further evidence of Bigglesworth’s career in the services.

Adding to the mystery, none has turned up so far.

Peter Elliott, who is in charge of the museum’s archives, said: ‘The WE Johns archive fills the curators with dread as his handwriting is famously terrible.

‘The combat report was tucked into a manuscript and would not have been found if we hadn’t been reviewing our material for the First World War.

‘RAF record-keeping was pretty thorough, but there is some evidence of Bigglesworth’s name having been removed from other sources, possibly for security reasons when he moved to the Special Air Police later in his career.’

Combat reports were filled in by all pilots at the end of an engagement to help their superiors assess the damage inflicted on the enemy.

Adventurer: Biggles encapsulated the daring attitude and traditional Imperial values of the time

The one written by Bigglesworth 
describes a fight over Hazebrouck in Northern France in 1918 that 
resulted in a ‘hostile machine’ being shot down.

It will be displayed as part of an 
exhibition about Biggles at the museum for its First World War centenary
exhibition next year.

Captain William Earl Johns, who died 
in 1968, was a pilot in the RFC – the forerunner of the RAF – before 
creating the Biggles adventures in the 1930s.

Johns was shot down and taken 
prisoner by the Germans in the latter stages of the war. He had switched
to the flying corps following service as an infantryman and then as a 
machine-gunner.

Discovery: It seems that author Captain William Earl Johns used James Bigglesworth as inspiration for his legendary character

Although the author himself has been 
suggested as the model for  Biggles, Johns stated that it was composite 
character based on a number of real people.

Biggles first appeared in the story The White Fokker, which was published in the first issue of Popular Flying magazine in 1932.

His adventures saw him serve in both world wars along with stints in the secret service and air police.
The series continued until the author’s death and ran to nearly 100 
volumes – including novels and short stories. Still in print, the books 
have been published in dozens of languages.

Firm favourite: The character was immortalised in the 1986 film 'Biggles'

The RAF Museum tells the story of the air force through its people and collections at a former airfield in Hendon, North London.

Its archive contains more than 1.2million items including letters, diaries, photographs, log books and combat reports.

Many of the First World War records are being digitised to make them more accessible to the public.
The Royal Air Force was founded on April 1, 1918, by combining the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service.
