An Italian professor said on Wednesday he has identified what he believes is the world's oldest complete scroll of the Torah, containing the full text of the first five books of Hebrew scripture.

Mauro Perani, professor of Hebrew at the University of Bologna, said experts and carbon dating tests done in Italy and the United States dated the scroll as having been made between 1155 and 1225.

The scroll, which has been in possession of the Bologna University Library for more than 100 years, had been previously thought to be from the 17th century. It had been labeled 'scroll 2'.

This is the document that an Italian expert says is the oldest known complete Torah scroll

There are many fragments of the Torah that are older but not complete scrolls with all five books.

'A Jew who was a librarian at the university examined the scroll in 1889 for a catalogue and wrote '17th century followed by a question mark,'' Perani said in a telephone interview.

But in preparation for a new catalogue of the university's Judaica collection, Perani, 63, studied the scroll and suspected that the librarian had made too cursory an examination in 1889 and not recognised its antiquity.

The professor said he immediately recognized that it had been wrongly dated given its script and other graphic notations

The meaning of the word Torah is varied.It refers to the Five Books of Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. 

The name - which derives from 'to teach' - can also refer to the entire Jewish bible or the whole body of Jewish law and teachings.

The so-called Old Testament (the New Testament are not part of Jewish scripture) is known to the Jewish faith as the 'Written Torah' or the 'Tanakh'.

The scriptures are always hand-written on scrolls.

The parchment on these scrolls are not meant to be touched by humans.

This is because some say because they are too holy; others say because the parchment, made from animal skins, is a source of ritual defilement; others say because the sweat from humans has acids that will damage the parchment.

Instead, the text is followed with a pointer, called a Yad.

'I realised that the style of the 
writing was older than the 17th century so I consulted with other 
experts,' he said of the scroll, which measures 36 metres by 64 cm (39 
yards by 25 inches).

He said the scroll showed many 
graphical features and scribal devices that were no longer used by 
copyists of Hebrew scripts in the 17th century.

The scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather each sewn together, most of them with three columns of script.

After the experts he consulted agreed 
that the scroll was probably several centuries older than previously 
believed, Perani had fragments of it subjected to carbon-14 dating 
tests.

The tests, at the 
University of Salento in southern Italy and the Radiocarbon Dating 
Laboratory at the University of Illinois, dated the scroll as from the 
second half of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th 
century.

The Torah, also known as the Hebrew Pentateuch, consists of the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.

The complete version of the Torah that was previously considered the oldest was from the late 13th century, Perani said.

He said that before the scroll came into possession of the University of Bologna in the 18th or 19th century it had been in the custody of the Dominican convent in the city that is home to the world's oldest university.

Perani said it was not clear where the Torah had been copied but most likely it was not in Italy. It was probably made by a copyist trained in the oriental tradition and likely done in the Middle East.

Perani has for two decades been head of the Italian Genizah project, which locates and catalogues fragments of Hebrew manuscripts in Italy. Genizah is the Hebrew word for the room in a synagogue where religious books or papers are stored.

The Genizah project has found, photographed and catalogued some 13,000 fragments of Jewish compositions from various branches of Talmudic literature, Biblical commentary, Jewish thought, the Hebrew language and Jewish history.

For his work in Jewish studies, Perani is due to be given an honorary degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem next month.
