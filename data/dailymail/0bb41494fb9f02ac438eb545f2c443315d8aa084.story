It was one of the most haunting tales to emerge from the Titanic disaster.

While others rushed to the lifeboats as the ship sank, millionaire Benjamin Guggenheim stoically sat sipping brandy with his personal secretary Victor Giglio, declaring they were 'prepared to go down like gentlemen'.

'No woman shall be left aboard this ship because Ben Guggenheim was a coward,' he told a survivor.

Guggenheim famously told other passengers 'we've dressed in our best and we'll go down like gentlemen' as they smoked cigars in the dining room. The immortal words were recorded in the 1997 Titanic film (pictured)

Now, for the first time, a face can be put to the name of Mr Giglio.

The first ever picture of Victor Guglio was found by Fr Anselm Cramer at the boarding school where the boy was educated

An archivist at Ampleforth, the North Yorkshire boarding school he attended, has unearthed this picture (right) of him aged 12.

The photograph – taken in 1901, 11 
years before he died on the Titanic – shows Mr Giglio, the son of an 
Italian father and Egyptian mother, dressed in his school uniform for a 
group shot.

Unlike the much-photographed U.S. 
industrialist Mr Guggenheim, who died aged 46, no photographs of Mr 
Giglio were believed to exist.

But after the Maritime Museum in 
Liverpool appealed for information about Mr Giglio to mark the 100th 
anniversary of the sinking, Fr Anselm Cramer, the archivist and 
librarian at Roman Catholic boarding school Ampleforth, uncovered the 
lost image in the school's files.

He also found tributes to Mr Giglio, 
who was the youngest of four brothers born in Liverpool to an Italian 
father and Egyptian mother, in the school's journal from 1912 and 1913.

One, from then Ampleforth headmaster 
Father Edmund Matthews, said: 'Those who knew Giglio at school will not 
require any assurance that he met death bravely and even willingly 
rather than, perhaps, take the place of someone else in the lifeboats.'

One of his schoolmates added at the 
time: 'I did not expect to see his name in the list of survivors. Giglio
 was unlikely to be saved when any were lost.'

Passengers wait to be rescued in Julian Fellowes' Titanic drama, which also depicted Guggenheim's last words. It is likely that Guglio would have been denied a lifeboat because of his skin colour

In a further journal a year on from 
the disaster Mr Giglio's mother is reported to have presented the school
 with books and music as a memorial to her son, who was a talented 
pianist.

Yesterday Fr Cramer said: 'Going back 
to Victor's time a greater part of the student body came from the 
thriving Catholic business community in Liverpool, so it is not 
surprising that he attended Ampleforth.'

John Graves, Curator of Ship History 
at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, South East London, 
confirmed: 'It is a rare photograph, I'm not aware of any other 
photographs of Victor Giglio.

'He must have been valued by Guggenheim because he travelled first class with him.

'His chauffeur, who also died on the Titanic, was travelling second class.'
