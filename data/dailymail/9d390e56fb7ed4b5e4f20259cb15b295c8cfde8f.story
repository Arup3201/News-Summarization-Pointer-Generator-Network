London has taken another step towards hosting a new NFL franchise after George Osborne opened talks with the American Football authorities.

The Chancellor is keen to push forward with the idea of bringing the NFL to England on a permanent basis and has held discussions over using Wembley as a permanent base.

Conservative politician Osborne, who is a leading figure in the coalition, has pledged Government support for any such franchise being introduced to Britain's capital and he has promised to help National Football League officials to ensure the project can go ahead.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, Osborne said: 'One of London's massive strengths is its sporting prowess, its great football (soccer) teams.

'This is primarily a decision for the owners of the clubs and the NFL organisation but I've said to the NFL that anything the Government can do to make this happen we will do, because I think it would be a huge boost to London.'

Interestingly, Osborne believes Britain can bring its own unique style to the American national sport. 

He continued: 'We could have not just the Star Spangled Banner at the beginning of NFL games but also God Save The Queen.'

London and Britain have embraced the American game with various matches taking places since 2007

However, London could soon become the permanent home for a new franchise - or for an existing one to move bases - if the Chancellor's bold proposal proves to be workable. 

It seems Osborne's passion for the sport came after he attended an NFL event in London's Regent Street.

Commenting on the event, he said: 'Regent Street was absolutely packed and not just with tourist but with Londoners. There are 32 teams in America - and one of them could be a London team. That's a serious prospect.' 

The Atlanta Falcons can still claw their way back into contention in the NFC South if they win at Wembley
