Southampton want to offer Jay Rodriguez a new contract in an attempt to keep him from Tottenham's clutches.

The England striker is a target for Mauricio Pochettino when the transfer window reopens in January.

Rodriguez's current deal expires at the end of the 2015/16 season, but the Saints - despite the fact he hasn't played since April due to a serious knee injury - want to extend his stay at St Mary's.

Rodriguez hasn't played since April due to a serious knee injury but Saints want to extend his deal

Pochettino has made the former Burnley man one of his priority signings in the New Year.

Meanwhile, the former Southampton boss is set to return to another past club, Espanyol, for defender Hector Moreno.

The central-defender, who has 57 caps for Mexico, worked under Pochettino at Espanyol during the manager's reign at the Spanish club.

Pochettino is also looking at bringing defender Hector Moreno, of his former club Espanyol, to Spurs

Pochettino originally signed Moreno for Espanyol from AZ Alkmaar in 2011.

Manchester United were linked with a move for the defender in the summer, but a broken leg suffered at the World Cup saw Louis van Gaal end his interest.

But Moreno's imminent return to fitness has put Pochettino on red-alert.
