The death toll in the New York Metro-North train crash could rise - with investigators looking for more bodies trapped under the wreckage.

Heavy-lifting cranes are being brought in to move the carriages, strewn on the tracks in The Bronx, New York.

Officials believe they have accounted for everyone on board and emergency services have searched the train thoroughly, but they cannot rule out the possibility that more dead bodies are buried.

Three of the four confirmed dead -  two men and two women - were thrown from the train on impact and there are fears that could have happened to more passengers.

Steve Morello, a spokesperson for 
Metropolitan Transportation Administration (MTA), said: 'The police and 
fire department have thoroughly searched the carriages, using a variety 
of equipment and specially trained dogs.

‘They
 went everywhere they could go in the search’, he said. ‘But there is no
 passenger manifest on a train so it is impossible to be 100 per cent 
certain everyone has been accounted for.

'A crane is being brought in, which should be here soon and will be able to lift the carriages.

'We will be on hand to assist in that operation.'

Three
 of the four people were killed when they were ejected from the 
southbound train, the fourth fatality was discovered inside one of the 
overturned train cars, officials said. Multiple witnesses have claimed 
the train was going too fast.

At
 least 63 people were injured in the wreck, officials added. The injured
 were rushed to four separate hospitals - 11 are critical, six are in 
serious condition. One man has spinal cord injuries and broken bones, 
the rest have suffered broken bones and lacerations, according to WABC.

Investigators
 from the National Transportation Safety Board have been on the scene 
since 12.30pm and have recovered the train's black box, a spokesperson 
said. The NTSB expects to be on the scene for over a week.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the train's recording device would help answer some questions about the underlying cause of the derailment.

'The black box will say what the speed was, whether the brakes were applied before the emergency brakes,' he told CBS.

The governor added that the accident 'would've been much, much worse if this had happened during the week.'

The Grand Central Station-bound 
Metro-North commuter train jumped the tracks near the Spuyten-Duyvil 
Station just before 7.30am Sunday morning. All seven of the train cars 
left the tracks, with two turning completely over and one stopping just 
before the Harlem River.

The
 violent derailment sent people flying through the train cars - some 
were even ejected from them - as windows smashed open, dirt and gravel 
shot inside them and the seven car train was left scattered around the 
tracks like a toy set.

'One
 woman seemed like she had lost most of her head,' a survivor told the 
Post. 'The side of the car was just covered in her blood.'

'[The
 dead woman] was flung out of the car,' she recalled. 'I used my yoga 
mat to cover her body. I’m probably still not processing it.'

'It was just a bloodbath,' an FDNY rescuer told the New York Post. 'This is the worse accident scene I’ve ever worked, there was blood everywhere.'

Family man: Writer James Lovell, 58, a married father of four, has been identified as one of the four victims of the derailment

This evening, information slowly began to trickle out about the four deceased victims - two men and two women.

One of the victims has been identified as 58-year-old Jim Lovell, the husband of Philipstown Deputy Supervisor Nancy Montgomery and a father of four.

Lovell and his wife lived in Cold Spring with their four children.

Philipstown.info described Mr Lovell as a professional writer who was active in the Democratic Party.

The other three victims have been 
identified tonight as James Ferrari, 59, of Montrose; Donna Smith, 54, 
of Newburgh, and 35-year-old Ahn Kisook, of Queens.

NTSB
 spokesperson Earl Weener said investigators expect to be on the scene 
'a week to 10 days' investigating the cause of the deadly crash.

The agency has already green-lit the use of a crane to upright the overturned train cars, Mr Weener said, adding that turning the locomotive over would stop further fuel from spilling.

It is not clear how much fuel has spilled.

The investigators worked the site throughout the afternoon, but the investigation will begin Monday in earnest, Mr Weener explained, adding that speed is considered a factor.

The NTSB will also look into Metro-North maintenance records after expressing earlier this year a concern over how well the train operator's equipment is maintained.

Engineer William Rockefeller Jr, 46, has
 claimed he tried to apply the brakes but they didn't work, according to
 multiple reports.

William Rockefeller Sr. defended his son to the Post, saying 'he’s one of the better engineers, the most dependable. And he really does like trains.'

Four people were confirmed dead on the scene of the accident, officials said.They were all riding in the overturned cars. Three individuals were found dead outside the train, FDNY Commissioner Sal Cassano added.

'We believe that three of the four fatalities were thrown from the train,' Mr Cassano said.

Metro North commuter trains do not have seat belts.

All seven of the train cars and the locomotive jumped the
 tracks just before the bend on the Hudson Line train, multiple cars are shown are their side, with one only inches 
from the Harlem River's icy waters.

'It’s obviously a very tragic situation,' Governor Cuomo said, 'unfortunately there are four fatalities and 63 people are injured.’

Despite a train earlier this year derailing only feet from this incident, the governor dismissed the track itself being the problem.

'The curve has been here for many years, trains take the curve everyday… there has to be another factor.'

President Barack Obama said in a statement issued by the White House that his thoughts and prayers are with the friends and families of the victims of the derailment.

According to the statement, the president was briefed on the accident Sunday morning.

The White House added that Obama will continue to stay in touch with New York officials throughout the day.

The train left Poughkeepsie at 5.54am and derailed at 7.22am, according to an MTA spokesperson. It was due to arrive at Grand Central at 7.30am.

A 14-year old boy and his father, as well as five off-duty NYPD officers were among the 63 injured, according to WABC. One officer sustained broken ribs and a broken shoulder, among other injuries.

The injured were taken to Jacobi Medical Center, St Barnabas Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, as well as New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan.

Mr Rockefeller Jr. is among the injured and originally called 911 to report the crash, the governor said, adding he is listed in stable condition at a local hospital.

He is married but has no 
children, according to his father who had no idea his son was on the train 
until the maligned operator's wife called to say he is okay.

A train employees union official called the accident the 'worst thing' he's seen in his 38 years on the tracks told the Wall Street Journal.

The train was being pushed by a diesel locomotive in the rear, there is some evidence to suggest fuel has spilled, but that has yet to be confirmed.

Some of the survivors were rescued by firefighters using jacks and airbags to lift the train cars off of them, Mr Cassano said.

Over 100 people were aboard the train. There were three conductors and an engineer among them - none of the dead are MTA employees, according to reports.

Officials do not expect to discover any more dead or injured, and all the wounded victims are expected to survive.  

Early
 footage from the scene showed divers in the water and cadaver dogs in the brush
 searching for bodies. At least 130 emergency responders arrived on the 
scene, an official said.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was notably absent from the press conference.

The MTA has said train service along the line is suspended indefinitely.
