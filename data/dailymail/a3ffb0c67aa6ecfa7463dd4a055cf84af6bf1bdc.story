Almost two fifths of Army recruits have the reading level of an 11-year-old, MPs warned today.

A similar proportion can only do maths aimed at pupils in their final year of primary school, according to a report by the Commons defence select committee.

The Army, Royal Air Force and the Naval Service have a good record in improving the maths and English skills of young recruits and trainees who join with low levels of qualifications, the study found.

MPs' warning: Almost two fifths of Army recruits have the reading level of an 11-year-old. In this file picture, a British Army Jackal is seen on patrol through the Eastern Desert in Helmand province, Afghanistan

The minimum requirement of new recruits is ‘entry level 2’, the report says - equivalent to the standard expected of a seven or eight-year-old in literacy and numeracy.

Of those who were recruited in 2012, all of those who joined the Naval Service or the RAF were above entry level 2, found the study, which looked at the education levels of the armed forces.

But 39 per cent of the Army had a literacy level of an 11 year old, and 38 per cent had this level of ability in numeracy.

It also found that 3.5 per cent of the Army were reading at the level of a seven or eight-year-old, while 1.7 per cent were at this standard in maths.

The Ministry of Defence had told the committee that it recruits service personnel at whatever level of attainment is available, the report says, adding that if this is the case, then it should take action when entry standards are particularly low.

It says that in light of planned changes to the three services, ‘it may be that recruiting personnel with higher levels of attainment would better meet the future needs of the armed forces.’

‘The MoD should identify how it might raise the basic entry level and still recruit sufficient personnel,’ the report says.

The
committee goes on to suggest: ‘Whilst we recognise that some recruits 
may not have done well in their previous academic careers and may not be
eager to take further academic exams, the MoD should encourage more 
recruits to undertake English and Maths GCSEs which would stand them in 
good stead for future employment.’

Provisions: Committee chair James Arbuthnot said it is 'vital' that service personnel receive 'excellent education'

Young
servicemen and women are being offered ‘challenging and constructive’ 
education and employment opportunities, the cross-party group of MPs 
acknowledge.

The committee also raises concerns that the Army is dependent on recruiting 16 and 17-year-olds.

More
than one in four (28 per cent) of Army recruits are under the age of 18
when they join, compared with 5 per cent for the Naval Service and 8 
per cent for the RAF.

‘We support the armed forces' provision of challenging and constructive education and employment opportunities for young people,’ the report says.

‘But we would welcome further information on why the Army is so dependent on recruiting personnel under the age of 18 years compared to the other two services, and whether steps are being taken to reduce this dependency.’

Committee chair James Arbuthnot said: ‘It is vital we provide excellent education for our personnel not just for their own career development but also to give them confidence that when the time comes to leave the service they will be able to transfer to a civilian career.'

The Conservative MP for North East Hampshire added: ‘They are more likely to remain in the service if this is the case.

'We welcome the work that has been done to increase the number of areas where personnel can acquire a civilian qualification and we would like to see this work further extended.’
