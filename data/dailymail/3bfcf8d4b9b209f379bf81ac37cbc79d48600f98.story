Today, when love letters are all but extinct, teenagers conduct their relationships in coarse text-speak via mobile phones, Twitter and Facebook.

But 18-year-old Herbert Wilkins and Ethel Ormerod, 15, fell in love in the more innocent climate of Victorian England.

Herbert, a woollen clerk, poured out his feelings for factory machinist Ethel in a series of romantic handwritten notes which have emerged after they were put up for sale on eBay and bought by archivists.

The heartfelt missives chronicle the forbidden affair between the young lovers who lived in neighbouring villages near Rossendale, Lancashire.

Love: Extraordinary handwritten notes between Herbert Wilkins and Ethel Ormerod more than 110 years ago have emerged

Couple: The handwritten letters capture the blossoming love of Herbert Wilkins, left, and Ethel Ormerod, right

Beginning in September 1898 they 
reveal how the couple were forced to meet in secret because Ethel’s 
father didn’t approve of their relationship.

After a six-year clandestine affair, 
they eventually married in 1904 when Ethel turned 21 and no longer 
needed her parents’ backing.

Addressed to ‘My dearest Ethel’, Herbert’s 
letters tell how the couple swapped locks of their hair as love tokens 
and tried to conceal their meetings from village gossips.

They include several poems, including one for ‘A Love Valentine, and are signed ‘Yours Forever, Herbert’.

Romance: The notes begin in 1898 when Herbert was 18 and Ethel was just 16. They talked of gossip in their Lancashire village about their affair, and of secret rendezvous at a local railway station

Historic: Amazingly the 40-strong collection of letters remained intact and were kept in an old Cadbury's Princess Elizabeth chocolate box. They eventually turned up for sale on Ebay

He went to great lengths to keep their
liaison under wraps, sending notes via friends or hand-delivering them 
to Ethel at work.

In one extract dated May 8, 1901, Herbert tells Ethel:
‘You are my own. No-one else in this world for me.

‘If I cannot have you I will die not 
married. You will think I am deeply in love when you read this. But it 
does not matter, it is only what you know already.

‘I think you love me as much as I love
you. Hell I am certain. You would not have stuck so close to me all 
these years if you didn’t do and I know you will not give up now when it
seems like being in Heaven now.’

Fortunate: David Tilsley, the collections manager at the Lancashire Archives in Preston, which recently acquired the series of letters

Display: The letters are available for the public to see at the Lancashire Archives in Preston after being snapped up by an archivist for £78

On July 4 that year he wrote: ‘As I 
have told you many a time I love you dearer than anything in the world. I
love you dearer than my own life.’

The 40-letter collection, found in a 
1940s Cadbury’s Princess Elizabeth chocolate box, are to go on public 
display after being bought by Lancashire County Council’s archive 
service for £78 from a collector.

Yesterday the Daily Mail tracked down 
the couple’s granddaughter, Christine French, 60, who said her family 
had known nothing about her grandparents’ secret affair.

Secretive: The letters also talked of tiffs, Mr Wilkins' 'incurable jealousy' and warned of Miss Ormerod's disapproving father steaming open letters in a bid to find proof of his daughter's relationship

Different world: The dreamy romantic language is a far cry from today's brash, mis-spelt, illegible and often foul mouthed notes posted on social media sites

She revealed that the couple had a 
daughter, Mary – Christine’s mother, who died in 1999 – and a son, 
Herbert, who died in infancy.

They were together for 31 years before Mr 
Wilkins died, aged 48, of a heart attack in 1929. Ethel died three years
later from cancer.

Mrs French, a civil servant, of Rossendale, said her
own mother believed her mother couldn’t live without her beloved and 
‘simply gave up on life’.

She said the letters may have been 
thrown away by accident when she had a clearout of their parents’ home 
last year. Who found them, though, was a mystery to her.

Together: Despite the controversy surrounding their relationship, the couple eventually got married in 1904

Family: The couple went on to have two children
