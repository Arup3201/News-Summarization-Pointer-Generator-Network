The Swedish group unanimously objected to their song being used in an anniversary exhibition fot the Battle of Waterloo claiming it would send out the 'wrong signals'

It was the song that catapulted them to international stardom – and set them on the road to amassing multi-million-pound fortunes.

But Abba are now strangely reluctant to repay the debt they owe to the famous battle that helped inspire their 1974 hit Waterloo.

The Swedish group were asked to help commemorate next year's 200th anniversary of the battle by allowing the first vinyl cut of the Eurovision-winning track to form part of an exhibition.

But the group unanimously objected, claiming it would send the 'wrong signals' about their song.

Last night, military historian Andrew Roberts condemned the band's decision. He said: 'It seems rather po-faced.

'It is a great shame people don't want to help with a project which is all about educating young people about this important event.'

Waterloo 200, which is organising next year's celebrations, had hoped to borrow the original disc from the Abba Museum in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, so that it could be included in an exhibition of 200 objects illustrating the importance and influence of the 1815 battle.

David Huse, the chief executive of Waterloo 200, said: 'It is a shame that Abba won't lend us the original copy of the record.

'We are keen that as many people as possible should embrace the commemorations and we thought including the song would be a good way of illustrating how the battle has impacted on popular culture. It would also have been a useful way of raising awareness of the events of 1815 among people who are familiar with the song but don't know anything about the battle that inspired it.'

But, refusing the request, Abba insisted the song is not about the actual battle, when French forces led by Napoleon Bonaparte were beaten by British and Prussian armies.

The song has the famous opening lyric 'My, my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender' – and during the hit's 1974 Eurovision performance, conductor Sven Olof Walldoff actually dressed as Napoleon.

A spokeswoman said the group's four members – Benny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Fältskog and Björn Ulvaeus – all agreed that the loan of the disc would have been inappropriate. She said: 'The question has come to us and we have said no to it. The issue was discussed by all four members of the band.

'The song isn't about the Battle of Waterloo and we don't want the record to be part of the exhibition. It gives the wrong signals.

'Waterloo is a pop song about someone meeting their own Waterloo. It is not about the battle.'

Mr Roberts said it was perhaps ironic that the song's lyrics were actually inaccurate. He joked: 'This is one of those rare occasions when Abba got it wrong. Napoleon did not surrender at Waterloo, but aboard HMS Bellerophon a month later.'
