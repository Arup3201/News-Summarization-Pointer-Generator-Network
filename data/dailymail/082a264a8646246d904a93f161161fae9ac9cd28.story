The nemesis of Manchester City in Champions League has yet to agree personal terms but the deal is advanced.

Callum McManaman has a point to prove at West Bromwich Albion, Tony Pulis insists.

The 23-year-old winger arrived from Wigan Athletic for £4.75million having failed to reproduce his stunning form from the 2013 FA Cup final on a consistent basis.

Pulis said: 'Callum has got something to prove. He's a great age and he's just right for us.

Aston Villa have made a late charge to steal MK Dons wonderkid Dele Alli from under Newcastle's noses.

It is understood Paul Lambert has launched an ambitious attempt to land the 18-year-old midfielder before Monday's transfer deadline.

As revealed by Sportsmail last week, Newcastle have made Alli a primary transfer target this month.

Burnley are showing an interest in Celtic's Anthony Stokes as they weigh up late additions to their squad.

The 26-year-old former Arsenal and Sunderland striker is open to a move and keen to return to England.

Aston Villa have joined Newcastle by showing interest in MK Dons midfielder Dele Alli.

Newcastle are willing to pay £4m rising to £5m and allow the 18-year-old to return to Dons on loan for the rest of the season. Villa have discussed a similar deal with slightly more up front for the England Under 19 international who has scored 12 goals this season.

Lazio have expressed an interest in taking over Real Madrid's loan for Javier Hernandez.

However, the move is doomed before it gets off the ground as the striker has already played for Manchester United in the League and Capital One Cup and can't play for three clubs in one season.

Manchester United are ready to offer a contract to Salford City trialist Sadik El Fitouri.

Sportsmail revealed how the 20-year-old right-back, who only joined Salford in December, had impressed staff during a game between United's Under 21s and first team fringe players.

He has continued to impress in training and in games and United are willing to offer an 18-month deal.

Crystal Palace have joined the chase for Bolton’s South Korean international Chung-Yong Lee as manager Alan Pardew eyes a hat-trick of Eagles signings before the close of the transfer window.

Pardew has already signed £5.75million QPR midfielder Jordon Mutch and is close to signing former Newcastle United striker Shola Ameobi who is a free agent.

But with Bolton looking to offload Lee for £500,000 as his contract enters its final six months, Pardew is interested in the 26-year-old wide player who he feels represents good value for money.

AC Milan are on the verge of completing a loan deal for Roma and Italy forward Mattia Destro.

Destro travelled to Milan on Thursday after agreeing terms with the club, who have already reached a deal with Roma.

The deal includes an option to buy Destro at the end of the season for a reported 16million euros (£12m). 

Roberto Martinez has admitted he is unlikely to sign a striker to replace Samuel Eto'o as he backed Arouna Kone to deliver Everton's goals.

Eto'o completed his move to Sampdoria earlier this week, which leaves Everton with Romelu Lukaku and Kone as their only recognised strikers.

Kone has endured a wretched time at Goodison Park, scoring only once since his £5million move from Wigan in 2013 and being restricted to a handful of starts because of a serious knee problem, but Martinez's faith in him is total.

Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard is being considered by MLS franchises ahead of next season.

Howard, 35, is a big commercial draw following his exploits in the World Cup and would be open to a return. 

He is a popular figure at Everton but Roberto Martinez is working on bringing in a new goalkeeper that will eventually replace him. 

Tom Ince is closing in on a loan move to Derby County - but Hull City are asking for a fee of £300,000. 

The Rams are reluctant to part with such a hefty amount, particularly because east Midlands rivals Nottingham Forest didn't pay a penny for a loan earlier in the season.

But Ince is happy to leave the KC Stadium in pursuit of first team football and is keen on playing for Steve McClaren.  

Borussia Dortmund are laying the groundwork for the potential departure of Mats Hummels to Manchester United.

Hummels has underlined in recent days that he intends to see out his contract but it is understood meetings have taken place outlining a price to United of around £37million.

Dortmund have also earmarked a potential replacement in Dinamo Kiev's Aleksandar Dragovic and have made contact this week.

Sportsmail's Simon Jones is reporting Lazio may come in to take over Real Madrid's loan of Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez. 

The Mexican striker has scored four goals in 14 matches for Real since Louis van Gaal allowed him to go out on loan back in August. 

Tottenham target Yevhen Konoplykana has revealed his interest in a move to Roma and says that the Serie A side and his club Dnipro have an agreement in place.

The winger, who scored a stunning goal against England at Wembley, is in high demand - with a number of clubs including Liverpool credited with an interest. 

But the Ukraine international insists that despite an agreement between the clubs, talk of an immediate move is premature.

Sportsmail's Simon Jones reporting that Jack Cork's move from Southampton to Swansea could be agreed today and completed after Sunday's Premier League clash between the sides. 

Mario Balotelli's agent has revealed the striker is 'very disappointed' with his time at Liverpool but has no immediate plans to leave the club.

The former AC Milan striker has failed to score a single Premier League goal since arriving at Anfield for £16million and has faced considerable criticism from supporters.

But Balotelli's agent, Mino Raiola, said the striker is not ready to turn his back on Brendan Rodgers.

Ravel Morrison has all but confirmed his transfer to Serie A side Lazio after posting a picture of his new shirt online.

The 21-year-old midfielder travelled to Italy on Wednesday to have a medical and complete his move from West Ham, where he has fallen out of favour. 

And Morrison appears to have sealed a deal to play for the sixth club of his career after releasing a picture of his name on the back of a Lazio shirt with the caption: 'Ravel 4'.

Paul Pogba will leave Juventus within 18 months and could even be sold in the summer.

The France international is being courted by a host of top clubs across Europe.

Manchester United, who somewhat controversially allowed Pogba to leave on a free transfer in the summer of 2012, are interested in bringing the 21-year-old back to Old Trafford.

Roberto Mancini has implored Yaya Toure to move to Italy in the summer, and wants the midfielder to become his lynchpin at Inter Milan. 

The Ivorian's future at Manchester City has been an ongoing concern since the summer fiasco whereby Toure and his agent told half-truths about varying situations. 

Mancini said: 'He's been to Belgium, Russia, Spain and England, but he's missing Italy. It could be a good opportunity for him to come and try.' 

In Italy, Corriere dello Sport, report that Mattia Destro's move from Roma to Milan will go through today.

Milan's vice-president Adriano Galliani made a personal mission to Destro's house in Rome to convince him to sign a loan deal.

The paper also suggest that Roma are interested in signing Shakhtar Donetsk striker Luiz Adriano and Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka.

Scott Sinclair has reportedly passed a medical as he looks set to complete a move to Aston Villa - as first reported by Sportsmail - and end an unproductive spell at Manchester City. 

West Ham are showing an interest in Bafetimbi Gomis at Swansea.

The France international is keen to leave the Liberty Stadium and would be keen on a move to Upton Park.

Crystal Palace have made offers for Gomis but the 29-year-old was reluctant to move to Selhurst Park. He has also been offereed to Schalke and Borussia Dortmund.

German keeper Arvid Schenk has left Dundee after weeks after letting in six goals on his debut.

The 25-year-old signed a short-term deal in October and made his debut in the 6-2 New Year's Day defeat by rivals Dundee United.

Dundee's website stated: 'Goalkeeper Arvid Schenk has this morning left the club at the end of his contract.'
