On the run: Chen Guangcheng is thought to have been helped in his escape from his home, which has angered Chinese authorities

A blind Chinese activist who dodged 100 guards to escape house arrest is believed to have taken refuge at the U.S. Embassy.

Chen Guangcheng, 40, had been under heavy guard at his 
house in Dongshigu village, in Shandong province southeast of Beijing, 
after exposing forced abortions as part of China's one-child policy.

But
after serving four years in prison and then being confined to his home,
the self-schooled lawyer is said to have fled from the authorities despite more than one hundred guards watching his village and 
is now believed to be at the U.S. Embassy.

The United States has not confirmed the reports by Texas-based ChinaAid and the Chinese government has declined to comment on Chen's escape.

But Texas-based ChinaAid said it 
'learned from a source close to the Chen Guangcheng situation that Chen 
is under U.S. protection and high level talks are currently under way 
between U.S. and Chinese officials regarding Chen's status'.

The claims could overshadow a two-day meeting with top Obama administration officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Beijing from Thursday, and ignite new tensions between the two governments.

Bob Fu, president of the religious and political rights advocacy group that has long campaigned for Chen's freedom, said: 'Because
of Chen's wide popularity, the Obama Administration must stand firmly 
with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the 
rule of law.'

The reports of Chen's escape come nearly three months after a Chinese official Wang Lijun fled into a U.S. consulate for over 24 hours on February 6, unleashing a scandal that has rattled the ruling Communist Party months before a once-in-a-decade leadership handover.

Anger: The activist's detention for exposing forced abortions in China caused international outcry

Wang's brief flight to the U.S. 
consulate led to the downfall of top official Bo Xilai who had been 
openly campaigning for a place in the inner circle of power in Beijing.

Pu Zhiqiang, a Beijing lawyer and 
rights advocate, said reliable contacts also told him Chen took refuge 
in U.S. embassy grounds.

He said: 'Everyone knew about the 
suffering of Chen Guangcheng and his family but nobody dared raised his 
head over this and ignored it.

'Chen Guangcheng has been the most 
typical victim of this lawless, boundless exercise of power. But the day
has finally come when he has escaped from it.'

Chen angered authorities in 2005 by 
exposing forced abortion in his own village and others nearby as part of
China's one-child policy.

Surrounded: Visitors trying to see Chen Guangcheng, including Christian Bale, have been forcibly removed from the village by over-zealous Chinese guards

He
was jailed soon after on a charge of 'blocking traffic' and damaging 
property in a protest, and has been held under house arrested ever since
his release in September 2010.

Lawyers and activists attempted to 
visit Chen in him home ever since have been forcibly denied entry to his
village by guards, while the man himself compared his own home to a 
'prison' due to his plight.

It
is thought the Chinese authorities had no legal grounds for detaining 
him, and guards even scuffled with Hollywood star Christian Bale when 
the Batman actor tried to visit Chen in his home.

Campaigner He Peirong, who is said to 
have helped Chen flee his house, would not discuss details of his 
escape, but denied reports he had entered the U.S. Embassy in Beijing on
Thursday night.

She said state security agents had 
begun a full-scale search by Thursday. 'There's absolutely no guarantee 
for his safety,' she said.

The
embassy would not comment and referred queries to the State Department,
where a press officer was not on duty overnight. Security outside the 
embassy appeared normal Friday.
