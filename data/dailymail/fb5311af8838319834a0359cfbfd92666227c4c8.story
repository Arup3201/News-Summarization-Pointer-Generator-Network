Former Aberdeen schoolboy Abdul Rakib Amin became involved with militant group Isis after breaking up with his fiancée, it has been claimed

A British man who appeared in a recruitment video for Islamic militant group Isis became involved with the group after breaking up with his fiancée, it has been claimed.

Former Aberdeen schoolboy Abdul Rakib Amin was identified this week as the third Briton in the recruitment video for the hardline Al-Qaeda-linked terror group.

Former school friends and neighbours have spoken of their shock after he was identified in the video.

It has now been claimed he became involved with the militant group after splitting up with his girlfriend.

One friend told The Sun: 'I think that was the turning point. He was vulnerable - and that made him easy pickings for the monsters who have brainwashed him.'

Amin was filmed alongside fellow Britons Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana, both 20, urging other Muslims to fight for Isis in the Middle East.

Wearing wrap-around sunglasses and a white scarf around his head, Amin describes jihad as ‘the cure for depression’ in the video.

Speaking in front of Isis’s black flag, he says: ‘Are you willing to sacrifice the fat job you’ve got, the big car you’ve got, the family you have? Are you willing to sacrifice this, for the sake of Allah?

‘Definitely, if you sacrifice something for Allah, Allah will give you 700 times more than this.’

Amin was educated in Aberdeen after 
moving from Bangladesh and his family left the Scottish city for 
Leicester a few years ago, according to reports.

Stunned former classmates have described how Amin was a 'really outgoing guy' who 'could have done really well for himself.'

Former classmate Naz Hussain said: 'He seemed like a really nice guy, outgoing, up for a laugh, a bit cheeky, getting into trouble now and then.

'Nothing like this I would have expected - how has somebody from Aberdeen managed to get involved with something like this?

'Fighting an organisation that people 
are saying even Al Qaeda are scared of? When I knew him as a kid he was 
all right, he wasn't overly religious.

'I would just see him at school, have a kick-about, always speak to him when I saw him in the street.

'Then he suddenly changed, his appearance changed, he started growing a beard, but I never thought anything like this would happen.

'You can't just think if somebody becomes more religious in their appearance that they'll become involved in something like this.

'I didn't see him too often when he changed but I used to just see him on the street and say hi and things like that.

'He just seemed like a really outgoing guy, he was bright, he was clever, he could have done really well for himself and now he's doing something like this.

'All my pals on Facebook and that they're all going crazy for it, because everyone knew him, he was a popular guy people are just commenting and saying they can't believe it, they're not sure what's happened to him.'

Neighbour Michael Hind, 65, said: 'I'd seen him about a few times and whenever I ran into him he was always really nice.

'There was always a bit of a crowd hanging around up there, some of the guys were a bit stand-offish but that guy would always say hello.

'He'd give my dog a good pet and be friendly to it. Unless it was a Friday and he was in his clothes for the mosque, he wouldn't pet the dog then.

'I think he used to go to the mosque quite often. I think they were very religious. But I'm surprised he's involved with something like this.'

Ibrahim Alwawi, imam of the Aberdeen Mosque and Islamic Centre, told the BBC: 'We, as the Muslim community in the city of Aberdeen, are shocked like everyone else.

'We are co-operating with the authorities as we usually do.'

Meanwhile,
 a mosque attended by two of the British jihadis fighting with Islamist 
rebels in Syria has denied teaching extremist ideologies.

'He just seemed like a really outgoing 
guy, he was bright, he was clever, he could have done really well for 
himself and now he's doing something like this'

The Al-Manar Centre reportedly confirmed that two men who appeared in the Isis propaganda video had visited the mosque.

But it denied encouraging members to take up arms to join extremists abroad.

In a statement reported by Sky News, the Al-Manar Centre said: 'It is worth mentioning that ACT's stance is well known, that we are opposed to going to Syria or any other country, to participate in an armed struggle and have always made this clear.

'We have on many occasions tackled the issues of extreme ideologies. Indeed, feeling the responsibilities towards our local community, especially those concerning the youth, we have engaged with parents warning against such dangers.

'We would like to emphasise that the vast majority of the local Muslim community are law abiding British citizens.

'May
 we reiterate our concerns that the internet has become an alarming 
source for radicalisation of such vulnerable members of our British 
society.'

Nasser Muthana and Reyaad Khan, both from
 Cardiff, featured prominently in the polished video by Isis, which 
urged Muslims in the West to join their fight.

The father of a British teenager who is thought to be fighting with Isis in Syria has also spoken of his 'limitless grief' and begged his son to come home.

Rahim Kalantar said he fears his 18-year-old son Ali may die fighting, kill innocent people or cause trouble if he returns to the UK.

Addressing his son on the BBC, Mr Kalantar said: 'You are my son. When you return I will be beside you everywhere and all the time. I won't let others harm you, whether's it's in the UK or anywhere else.'

'Just come back. Return and put an end to the grief of your father, mother and sisters.'

Mr Kalantar's anguish has been matched by the father of Nasser Muthana, who has said his son had 'betrayed' his country.

Ahmed Muthana believes his other son, 17-year-old Aseel, is also in the Middle East and said they were 'brainwashed' in the UK.
