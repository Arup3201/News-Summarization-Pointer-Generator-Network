A Missouri man who weighs 570 pounds has vowed to run a 5K every month for the next nine months in an inspirational bid to change his life around before it's too late.

Derek Mitchell, 34, of Kansas City learned five years ago he had a pituitary tumor contributing to his 625 weight at the time.

However, removing the tumor wasn't enough to help Derek battle the bulge, so now he's fighting to turn his life around by kicking his soda addiction and adopting a vegan diet in order to get his life back and ensure he's got a healthy, hopeful future to look forward to.

Took a good look: Derek Mitchell of Kansas City decided to turn his life around reaching 625 pounds

'I just knew I had to do something if I had hope for a future or anything like that,' Mitchell told Fox4KC.com.

After giving up soda as a New Year's resolution, he decided to take things a step further by putting one foot in front of the other as part of his nightly neighborhood walks.

'I started just walking around in my neighborhood, and I started at a mile and then worked my way up to a little over two miles a day,' Mitchell said this month after a month or so of his walks.

Mitchell uses an app to post maps of his walks to Facebook and he's had a mob of supporters urging him on after every walk.

Fight of his life: Derek learned 5 years ago that he had a pituitary tumor that was contributing to his obesity. Even with it removed, he knew he had to fight to get the weight off

Mitchell says he's planning to run another 5K next month and one every month thereafter for the rest of the year

He's since lost some 75 pounds. Mitchell did his first 5K on March 14.

'If I can walk a 5K, anyone can, and I'm living proof of that now,' he said. The 3.1 miles took home around an hour and a half, he said. 

It was his marathon enthusiast sister who suggested the 5K, reports BuzzFeed.

'I wanted to cross the finish line with my hands up, because that's how it felt! It was pretty awesome,' Mitchell told Fox4KC.

So excited, in fact, that Mitchell says he's planning to run another 5K next month and one every month thereafter for the rest of the year.

Still going: Seen here in 2013, Derek has since dropped his soda habit along with 75 pounds and he doesn't plan to stop losing it any time soon
