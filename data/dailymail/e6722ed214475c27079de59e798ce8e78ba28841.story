Tearful mourners have gathered in Mozambique for the funeral of a taxi driver who died after being handcuffed to a police patrol car and dragged through the streets in South Africa.

Shocking video footage captured the moment Mido Macia, 27, was attacked by officers for allegedly blocking the road and resisting arrest before the van speeds off in front of a crowd of onlookers.

He was found dead two hours later in a police cell in Daveyton, South Africa.

'We are revolted, not just angry. It was torture what happened to him,' said a friend of Mr Macia, Xinguinhane Vuma, at his funeral today.

Friends and family have demanded justice for the death of former taxi driver and immigrant Mido Macia

'Our feeling is very deep. We hope he rests in peace,' Mr Vuma said at the graveside.

Nine police officers have been charged 
with his murder and they will again appear in court on Monday as their 
bail hearing continues.

Mr Macia's widow and parents were among a large crowd who attended his funeral in the Matola district of Mozambique, west of the capital city Matola today.

His coffin arrived in Mozambique during the night, and mourners 
could view his body before the funeral at the Nelson Mandela primary 
school nearby.

It was draped in flowers and prayers were said before it was lowered into the ground.

Ana Carlos Maposse, a resident of Matola,said the community does not feel compassion for those who killed Mr Macia.  

At the same time, human rights campaigners staged a rally in front of the South African embassy in Mozambique to protest again Mr Macia's death.

The crowd chanted 'Down with xenophobia' and brandished banners with the words 'Stop Humiliating Mozambicans' and 'Mido Macia forever'.

The scandal is only the latest to undermine confidence in South Africa's police, heaping yet more shame on a
force that opened fire on striking workers at the Marikana platinum 
mine in August last year, killing 34 people.

Friends described him as a humble man and spoke of the profound shock his death has caused in the community of Matola Rio where his father is a local leader.

Around 2,000 people attended the funeral, among them several government officials and Mozambican liberation hero and elder statesman Marcelino dos San

It also comes as the Oscar Pistorius murder trial puts the country’s criminal justice system in the spotlight.

Mr Macia was arrested in the Daveyton 
township outside Johannesburg on Tuesday evening. An anonymous witness 
told a local newspaper: ‘[Police] argued with Macia and then they beat 
him up.

‘They handcuffed him to the back of the van and slammed the door in his face.

‘With blood running down his face they
drove off. He was in pain. He cried and asked the cops to stop but they
continued anyway.’

A post-mortem found that Mr Macia died of hypoxia and had lacerations to his head

South Africa’s Independent Police 
Investigative Directorate, which has launched an investigation, said the
probable cause of death was head injuries with internal bleeding.

Spokesman Moses Dlamini said 
investigators had been told Mr Macia was asked to move his minibus taxi 
by two policemen because it was blocking the road.

Mr Macia then allegedly assaulted one 
of the officers and took his gun, before officers managed to put the 
‘resisting suspect’ into the van to go to the cells.

A prisoner who was in the police station said: ‘They killed him. They beat him up so badly in here.’

The incident has prompted a  furious 
backlash in South Africa. Frans Cronje from the South African Institute 
of Race Relations think-tank said: ‘It is a level of barbarity on a par
with police behaviour at Marikana.

‘We strongly support the police use of force to meet the criminal onslaught.

‘But this is an ill-disciplined and 
brutal rabble that have lost all respect for themselves, their jobs, the
societies they work in.’

The footage of Mr Macia's treatment by South African police has sparked mass protests and worldwide condemnation
