George Zimmerman will not face federal civil rights charges over the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin, it has been claimed.

Three law enforcement officials have reportedly said there is insufficient evidence to prove the killing was racially motivated and that the case will now have to be dropped.

Zimmerman was last year acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of 17 year old Martin, following a high-profile trial in Sanford, Florida.

In the clear? George Zimmerman, left, will not federal charges over the 2012 shooting of teenager Trayvon Martin, right, it has been claimed

The verdict, which followed months of heightened racial tension over the killing, sparked a series of nationwide demonstrations.

Over 600,000 people signed an online petition urging the Department of Justice to press civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

But yesterday, the three officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to the Washington Post, said it was almost certain that the department would close the investigation.

One of the officials, who was not authorized to discuss the case, told the Post that investigators now only wanted to 'dot their i’s and cross their t’s'.

While it is understood the team still want to look at a computer belonging to Zimmerman which had no not been examined for the state trial, it is highly unlikely that it would contain any useable evidence.

The Justice Department insist the investigation remains open, with a source telling Fox News: 'The investigation into the shooting is active and ongoing'.

Protests: Thousands took to the streets across America after Zimmerman was  acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of 17-year-old Martin

Anger: Demonstrators gather in New York's Time Square to demanded justice a day after Zimmerman was found not guilty

For Zimmerman to be found guilty of a
 hate crime prosecutors would have to prove he both followed and shot 
Martin purely because he was an African American.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing 
Martin’s family, said they were not prepared to comment until an 
official announcement by the justice department.

Zimmerman, a former neighbourhood watch volunteer, was accused of murdering the unarmed Martin in a racially motivated attack.

The Martin case draws many similarities with that of Michael Brown whose killing by a white police officer has prompted two civil rights investigations

Prosecutors
 claimed the Zimmerman had automatically assumed Martin, who was walking
 to his father's apartment to watch a basketball game on television, was
 a criminal because he was black and wearing a hooded top.

Zimmerman confronted Martin on the street and following a struggle pulled a pistiol from his waitsband and shot the teenager through the cheek at point blank range. 

But Zimmerman's defence team argued there was no evidence to prove their client, who describes himself as Hispanic, was racist.

They pointed to statements saying that Zoimmerman had taken a black girl to his school prom, that his best friend was black and that he had mentored two black youths.

Following the trial Zimmerman reportedly went into hiding fearing he would be targeted.

Such was the reaction to the not guilty verdict that President Barack Obama was forced to make a personal appeal for calm.

He said at the time: 'We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken.

'I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.'

The case draws many similarities to that 18-year-old Michael Brown, a black teenager who died after being shot at least six times by a white police officer in Ferguson.

Federal officials have launched two civil rights investigations, one into Brown's killing and one into the Ferguson Police Department's overall track record with minorities.
