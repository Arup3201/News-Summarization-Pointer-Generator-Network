Sergio Aguero was booked for diving in the opening stages of Manchester City's trip to Southampton, despite Saints defender Jose Fonte making clear contact with him inside the penalty area.

Referee Mike Jones booked the Argentine despite the appeal from City players, and the visitors had a right to feel aggrieved.

Here, Sportsmail's resident refereeing expert Graham Poll gives his view on the decision.

Jones books Aguero as City players go to remonstrate with the official with Aguero pleading his innocence

Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports at half-time: 'That could be one of the worst decision I have seen this season. How has he [the referee] missed that?' 

Mike Jones, often considered as the weakest member of the select group of referees, made one of the worst decisions of the season when he somehow missed Jose Fonte wipe Sergio Aguero out for a stonewall penalty. 

As if that was not bad enough Jones then rubbed salt in the wound by showing Aguerro a yellow card for diving! However, Manchester City won the match comfortably enough so does it really matter that Jones made such a blatant mistake – after all he is human? Well I think it does.

Firstly Aguero has a yellow card to his name that, however wrong, cannot be over turned. He could end up being suspended for accumulating cautions.

Next his booking will be recorded as simulation which will mar the Premier league statistics and be forever against Aguero’s record.

So why did Jones make such a basic error and can he improve?

His first decision of the game was a very good one but perhaps contributed to the error with the Aguero incident. When Victor Wanyama slid across Yaya Toure in just the seventh minute Jones, despite not having the best viewing angle, did not hesitate to give a free-kick and caution the Southampton player. 

This was despite Wanyama’s vehement denial that he had done anything wrong and had in fact played the ball. Other Southampton players pressurised Jones, querying his decision, perhaps hoping to influence the referee and get into his head early on. I think they succeeded.

Aguero is clearly fouled inside the area by Fonte, but was booked for the dive inside the opening 10 minutes

Despite replays proving that Jones was 100 per cent correct to both award the free-kick and to caution Wanyama I think he doubted himself and so when called upon to make a big decision, a penalty kick, he got it wrong by doubting what he saw.

Confidence is an important ingredient in good performances, whatever you are doing; if you are refereeing at the top level it is vital. 

Jones’ confidence has always been fragile which perhaps offers evidence as to why so many people question his ability to perform at this level. I question those who appoint him to such a high profile game, second versus third in the Premier League.
