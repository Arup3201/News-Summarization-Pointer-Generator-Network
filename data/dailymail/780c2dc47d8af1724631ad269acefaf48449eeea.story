When Sam Burch and a few of her friends promoted their new Women’s Institute group on Facebook, they were stunned by the response.

More than 350 women turned up to join at the church hall they had booked.

They were totally unprepared for the growing interest in the ‘Jam and Jerusalem’ organisation, which leading members say has been sparked by the popularity of shows such as The Great British Bake Off and further helped by the ease of spreading the word on Facebook.

However, there was room for just 220 inside the church hall in Bromley Heath, Bristol – so after having queued in the street for hours to enrol, many found themselves turned away. At one point organisers were so overwhelmed by the numbers they considered asking police to help.

Disappointed: 100 women were turned away as the founders of the Bromley Heath group were forced to cap numbers at 220 new recruits. The women braved miserable weather to be in with a chance to join

Branch President Mrs Burch, 41, said: 'I was amazed by the numbers. I was slightly 
worried it might happen and we might need to call the police or 
something.

'When people 
said there was queuing outside we ran to the door and let the first lot 
of women in and then you couldn’t move - and they were still queuing 
outside.

'I think the community is part of it, it is a very friendly community and we are trying to make it more so.

'We had spoken to friends who said 
they were coming along and knew they would but there were so many more. 
We disappointed a few people, which we didn’t want to do.

'Many
women I know don’t do much for themselves, they do a lot for their 
kids, families, houses and their work but this is something for them, 
where they can learn to make cocktails and how to sort out the car or 
make a curry.'

Facebook effect: President Sam Burch believes advertising the group on Facebook led to the surge in interest from new members. The group are looking forward to a packed calendar of events

The first seeds of an idea for the new group were sown in August when 14 women responded to Ms Burch's appeal on Facebook.

She
said: 'There was another meeting in my living room - it was bring your 
own chair and your own glass and then two-and-a-half months down the 
line we launched. It was a little bit quick.'

But
forget 'Jam and Jerusalem', the new troupe - made up of women aged 20 
to 60 - have a packed calender of events, including cocktail making and 
car maintenance workshops.

Senior members of the WI say 
interest in the organisation has been boosted by 
cooking shows, including The Great British Bake Off and Great British 
Sewing Bee.

National 
chairman of the WI, Janice Langley said she has never heard of such 
numbers signing up to a single branch ever before in its 98-year 
history.

The influx of 
women at the new branch last Thursday comes after two further WI groups 
started in Bristol in the last two weeks - adding to the 4,300 members 
already signed up across the city.

The iconic organisation was set up in 1915 to harness the spirit of the First World War and is best known for jam-making and its anthem Jerusalem.

'It’s fabulous,' National chairman, Janice Langley, said. 'I do think Facebook does make a lot of difference as it is a very quick and easy way of spreading the news and then people pass it on.'

Chairwoman of the Avon Federation of Women’s Institutes, Donna Butcher, said when the local Clifton branch was launched several years ago more than 100 women turned up.

She said: 'We have started three in the last fortnight, one in St George the week before and one in Redfield the night before, they saw large numbers but not as many as Bromley Heath.

'I think it is because women want to meet people in the neighbourhood, it is community and that is the theme at Bromley Heath, doing things together baking cakes, dress-making and I think television as well have played their part such as Bake Off and Sewing Bee and things like that. And just making friends, it’s fun.'

Florist mum-of-three Vicki Veasey, 33, was involved in the Bromley Heath WI from the start, having responded to the initial Facebook message.

She said: 'It is a great community here with lots of lovely groups, mostly focused around the kids.

'It is great to meet lots of lovely people but you tend to do things around the kids so this is a nice way to try a few crafts and go out somewhere without the kids.

'The response was fantastic, it shows there is definitely a need for many more groups in the local area. It feels like we are at the beginning of something exciting.

'I grew up in Bromley Heath and went to the school there and there were all my old school friends I hadn’t seen for years turning up.'

Committee member Diane Flower added: 'The reason I wanted to get involved was to meet more ladies in the community and just do something a bit different. It is a good mixture of the traditional and something a bit different.'
