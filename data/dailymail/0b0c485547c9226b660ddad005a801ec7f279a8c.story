A 20-year-old woman from Massachusetts who was banned from driving took to the road after manufacturing a home-made licence plate for her car.

Writing on a piece of cardboard, she used a red marker pen to draw out letters in the centre of the licence plate before using a blue pen to write 'Massachusetts' at the top and 'Spirit of America' below.

However the forgery proved less-than convincing after officers driving along the I-391 in Chicopee quickly spotted the fake plate.

A 20-year-oldwho was banned from driving attempted to fool cops by attaching this home-made licence plate to her car, complete with Massachusetts written at the top and 'The Spirit of America' at the bottom

The woman was pulled over at 7.30am when police discovered she had several violations against her, including a suspended licence and revoked registration.

A spokesman for Massachusetts State Police said: 'The operator of the vehicle was charged with several violations, including having a suspended license and revoked registration.

'Moral of the story, if you shouldn’t be driving, please don’t.'

The female driver was charged with driving with a suspended license and attaching false plates.

However, cops weren't fooled, and she has now been charged with driving with a suspended license and attaching false plates (pictured, how the licence plate should have looked)
