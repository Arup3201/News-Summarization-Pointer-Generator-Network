PC Warren Luke has been cleared of assaulting a woman at Great Ormond Street hospital

A police officer was cleared yesterday of assaulting a woman in front of her daughter at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Pc Warren Luke, 38, was accused of attacking the 41-year-old when she refused to leave the side of the seriously ill seven-year-old.

But a jury acquitted him of a single charge of assault after hearing that he acted in self-defence when the woman became violent.

The policeman closed his eyes and nodded as the verdict was revealed as colleagues sobbed with relief.

Trial judge Peter Ader told him there were ‘lessons to be learnt’ from the case to prevent the situation ever happening again.

The Met officer remains suspended from duty and could yet lose his job pending the outcome of an internal disciplinary hearing.

Pc Luke clashed with the woman in a private room at the world famous children’s hospital in December 2013.

He had been called by medical staff to help diffuse a stand-off with the woman who refused to leave and was shouting at doctors.

Pc Luke was arrested within hours after fellow police officers reported his actions to a senior member of staff.

The jury was told the officer punched the mum in the face and kicked her as he tried to subdue her and remove her from the room.

The woman claimed she feared for her life and was ‘helpless’ as the officer punched her and kicked her ‘six or seven times’.

Two of Pc Luke’s colleagues described the attack as ‘horrific’ and said they were shocked by what they saw.

But his defence team successfully argued he acted in self-defence and the jury concluded he had acted reasonably in the lawful execution of his duty.

Following the verdict, Judge Ader said to Pc Luke: ‘Can I make a suggestion that there are lessons to be learned from this case?

‘You wouldn’t want a repeat of this situation on another occasion, would you?’ The officer replied: ‘No, Your Honour.’

PC Luke declined to comment as he left court. A Met spokesman said: ‘There will now be a misconduct review.’
