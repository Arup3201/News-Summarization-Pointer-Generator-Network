The girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd broke down in tears on the stand at Aaron Hernandez's murder trial today as she recalled the middle-of-the-night call which brought news that her boyfriend was dead.

Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancée Shayanna, also testified on Tuesday about her sister's 'secretive' behavior in the hours after Lloyd's body was found on June 17, 2013, in industrial scrub land close to the football player's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts.

Hernandez, a former Patriots tight-end, is accused of the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player. He has pleaded not guilty.

Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancée Shayanna, broke down on the stand on Tuesday when she described the last time she saw her boyfriend Odin Lloyd before her was murdered

Miss Jenkins, a graduate law student, told the court in Fall River that she had a close relationship with her sister but that Shayanna 'was not being normal' the morning after Odin's murder. 

Shaneah, who had gone to her sister's house following her boyfriend's death, said that Shayanna took a number of phone calls in another room at her home and then went to the basement several times, on the last occasion carrying a black garbage bag.

Shaneah, who is a witness for the prosecution, said that Hernandez, 25, only briefly spoke to her once about her 27-year-old boyfriend's untimely death.

Neither Shayanna Jenkins nor other supporters of the defendant were in court today during Miss Jenkins' testimony. 

Prosecutors have listed Shayanna Jenkins, who has a young daughter with Hernandez, as a possible witness and this month petitioned the court to grant immunity to her. That could compel her to testify.

'He [Hernandez] came into the dining room, rubbed my shoulder and asked me if I was okay,' Miss Jenkins said.

'He told me he had been through this death thing before and it will get better with time.'

Hernandez remained emotionless and stared at the ceiling as Miss Jenkins, who had been dating Lloyd for 18 months, became tearful as she recalled the last time she spoke to him.

Miss Jenkins said that she spoke to Odin several times on June 16, which was Father's Day, from her home in Connecticut.

Odin told her that he was going to work the following day and he had to return a rental car after he finished.

During her morning commute the following day, she called Odin at 7.30am but was unable to reach him. Miss Jenkins testified that she called him at lunchtime, got no response and again, at 8pm that night.

Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancée, looks on in court on Thursday during opening statements. Her sister Shaneah told the court today that her sister was behaving strangely the day after Odin Lloyd's murder 

Shaneah was woken up late that night by Trooper Benson from North Attleboro who informed her that Odin was dead.

The law student, who has remained composed and given measured, articulate answers on the stand, broke down as she recalled finding out he had died.

Miss Jenkins dabbed at her nose and eyes with a tissue but was able to continue. 

She testified that in the early hours of June 18, she tried to call Shayanna but couldn't get through to her sister.

Shayanna then called back and 'sounded like she was in the car', Shaneah said.

The grieving young woman then drove from her home in Connecticut to visit Odin's family in Massachusetts and some hours later, then drove to her sister's home about an hour away. 

Shaneah testified that on June 18, Hernandez left the home and she stayed in the living room for some hours with her sister, niece and uncle.

Sometime around noon, Shayanna received a number of phone calls and text messages. 

'Her responses were short and she kept getting up and leaving the room,' Miss Jenkins said. 'She was not behaving normally. She was being secretive.' 

Shaneah said Shayanna went to basement two or three times. On the last time she went, she had a black garbage bag which she did not explain what was for. 

Shayanna then borrowed Shaneah's car - which she had never done before, saying that she had to go to the bank to collect money for the housekeepers. 

When her sister returned, Shaneah said she then left to visit Odin's family and on her return, found police searching the Hernandez home. 

She said that Hernandez's behavior following the police search 'was a little stressed but normal'. 

The trial continues.
