The north-south divide between Britain's cities has widened 'dramatically', a new report warns today.

For every 12 people who found work since 2004 in cities in southern England, only one was hired in cities in the rest of the country, research by the Centre for Cities found.

Employment in London increased by more than 17 per cent between 2004 and 2013 while Blackpool, Rochdale and Gloucester saw falls of 10 per cent, said the report.

The number of employees in Milton Keynes, London and Cambridge rose by more than 15% over a decade, but fell in cities like Gloucester, Rochdale and Blackpool

National economic growth in the last decade has been fuelled by a boom in just a handful of cities, most of them in the south of England.

Numbers in work in London rose by more than 17 per cent between 2004 and 2013 while Blackpool, Rochdale and Gloucester saw falls of 10 per cent, said the report.

There was also a huge difference in populations, growing by 16.5 per cent in Milton Keynes and falling by 1.4 per cent in Sunderland.

The number of new businesses varied - up by almost a third in Swindon but down by 5.5 per cent in Grimsby.

Andrew Carter, acting chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: 'Five months out from the election, this report makes the strongest economic case yet for the next Government to step up to the challenge of investing in the long-term success of our cities, and build a brighter future in which more people and places can contribute to, and share in, prosperity and growth.

'The stark picture the report paints of the enormous gap in the fortunes of UK cities over 10 years underlines why a 'steady as she goes' approach must be scrapped.

'We must move from thinking that bundling up new funding streams with bureaucratic delays, or simply tinkering around the edges with well-intentioned announcements, will be enough to reverse trends that are becoming increasingly entrenched.'

Ed Cox, director of IPPR North, said more powers needed to be devolved to regions to help them create prosperity and ensure smaller places do not fall behind as core cities grow.

The number of businesses rose sharply in southern cities like London, Swindon and Bristol between 2004 and 2013, but fell in Blackpool and Grimsby, the report found

Cities Minister Greg Clark, said: 'This Government's long-term economic plan is working right across the country.

'Since 2010 over 60 per cent of the rise in employment has taken place outside London and the South East - that's over a million more people in work. We know there is more to do and that's why we have given greater powers to 27 of the UK's largest cities through City Deals, and why we have committed a further £7 billion to the north of England, alongside the ground-breaking devolution deals and £6 billion of Growth Deals in every part of England.'

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: 'Centre for Cities' 2015 Cities Outlook highlights the huge potential for more balanced growth across Britain by devolving powers and budgets.

'The Tory-led Government came to office promising to rebalance the economy but instead we've seen too many parts of Britain held back and the benefits of growth being concentrated in the hands of the few.

'Under this Government, cities with the greatest needs have been hit hardest.

'The next Labour government will push power away from Whitehall and give city and county regions and local areas the powers they need to boost local growth.

'Under our plans £30bn of budgets would be devolved down and combined authorities would be able to keep more of their revenue from business rates so they can benefit from additional growth.'
