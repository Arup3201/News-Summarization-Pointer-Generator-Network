Leaker Edward Snowden says the US government failed to keep track of the Boston bombing suspects

National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden says the Boston Marathon bombings are an example of how threats can be missed even under blanket surveillance.

Snowden, who leaked millions of documents to journalists, talked to Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig on Monday online from Russia, where he is in exile.

'The reality is that we knew who these guys were and who they were associating with — but we didn't follow up or watch these guys,' he said, according to the Boston Globe. 

Snowden added that he comes from a family that believe 'fundamentally the government had noble aims and that it did good things.’'

'But what I was not aware of and have grown aware of, while the people in government largely are there for the right reasons, there is a culture that pervades the upper levels, the senior levels that has become less accountable to the public they serve,' he said, according to the Globe.

He added of the surveillance programs: 'They were happening beyond any possible statute for recording, based on the Constitution.'

Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is awaiting trial for April 2013 explosions that killed three people.

His brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with police.

In 2011, Russian intelligence told the FBI that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a follower of radical Islam, and U.S. officials added their mother to a federal terrorism database.

Despite Snowden's claims, a former intelligence official says the disclosure of top-secret surveillance programs has changed the way terrorists communicate and pushed many underground, CNN Reported.

'We've lost collection against some individuals, people that we were concerned about we are no longer collecting their communications,' Matt Olsen, the ex-chief of the National Counterterrorism Center, told CNN.

'We lost insight into what they were doing.'

He added: 'They've changed how they encrypt their communications and adopted more stringent encryption techniques.

'They've changed service providers and email addresses and they've, in some cases, just dropped off all together.'
