Going public: Joanna Shields will create an international hub for technology in London

A senior executive from Facebook is joining the public payroll – and will be paid almost as much as the Prime Minister to try to turn London into a rival to Silicon Valley.

The appointment of Joanna Shields comes at a time when the social networking site has come under fire for paying hardly any tax despite its huge profits.

She will earn £115,000 a year in her new role as chief executive of the Tech City Investment Organisation, plus a £25,000 performance-related bonus, meaning her total pay is just short of David Cameron’s £142,500 salary.

Miss Shields, 50, Facebook’s vice president and managing director in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, defended the company against allegations of tax avoidance.

Last year it paid tax of only £200,000 on estimated UK revenues of £175million.

‘What’s missing from the story is why people do it,’ she said.

‘The reason those companies make those decisions is because of the investment environment and the tax environment.’

Miss Shields takes up her post in January.

It was set up by the Government body UK Trade and Investment to encourage investment in a technology hub around Shoreditch in East London known as Tech City

Around 3,000 digital companies already operate in the area.

Miss Shields said London was the 
perfect international hub for digital innovation and should not be the 
‘stepchild’ of Silicon Valley in California and Bangalore in India.

Her role is to help secure investment for start-up companies and to lessen the red tape associated with starting a business.

It also involves working as a business ambassador promoting the UK around the world.

Meanwhile, two more foreign companies were yesterday accused of paying minimal tax in Britain despite big sales.

The American internet auction giant 
eBay paid only £1million of corporation tax on sales of £789million and 
estimated profits of £181million in the UK during 2010 after channelling
 cash through foreign companies to slash its bill legally from 
£51million.

Ikea paid £8.1million of corporation 
tax on sales of £1.2billion and profits of £23.6million in the year to 
August 2011.

The Swedish flat-pack furniture giant uses a legal 
accounting method to lower its UK profits.
