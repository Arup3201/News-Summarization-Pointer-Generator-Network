Five passengers are presumed dead after a small plane crashed tragically into the icy depths of a Colorado reservoir Saturday afternoon.

It was a recovery mission from the start as crews at the Ridgeway Reservoir worked to fish out the single-engine Socata TBM700 and the bodies of everyone aboard after they fell out of the sky for undetermined reasons around 2pm.

Efforts were suspended Saturday evening, in part because responders to the rugged rural area lacked equipment necessary to recover the wreckage and victims from 60 to 90 feet of frigid water about 90 feet from shore.

Arduous: It was a recovery mission from the start as responders fought frigid conditions in water 90-feet deep

The plane was flying from Bartlesville, Oklahoma, to Montrose, about 180 miles southwest of Denver, when it went down Saturday, Ouray County spokeswoman Marti Whitmore said.

Whitmore said no one is believed to have survived, but no victims have been recovered from the aircraft, which was located about 90 feet from shore in 60 to 90 feet of water.

Dive teams from Denver and Gunnison were expected to arrive at the reservoir Sunday afternoon.

‘We have recovered pieces of the tail yesterday, but the fuselage is in the water. We have a good sense of where it is but the water is very cold and very murky, so it is a little bit of a challenge to get in there,’ Whitmore told the Denver Post.

The plane was a single-engine Socata TBM700 registered to a corporation in Alabama and en route to Montrose from Bartlesville, Oklahoma. The identities of the occupants were being withheld Sunday until relatives could be notified

‘We don't have the right resources in the county’ to recover the plane, she said Sunday.

The 1996 model plane was registered to Gadsden Aviation of Rainbow City, Alabama, the Denver Post reports.

It was  en route to Montrose after stopping in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.

The flight originated out of Gadsden, Alabama.

The identities of the occupants were being withheld until relatives could be notified.
