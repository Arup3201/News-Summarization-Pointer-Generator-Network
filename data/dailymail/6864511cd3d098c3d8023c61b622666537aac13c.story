David Kean met women through online dating sites and admitted 13 charges of theft after stealing from them

A conman was jailed today for stealing from 13 lovers he met on the internet.

Former barman David Kean, 41, moved into their homes and then left with jewellery, computers and cars totalling £8,000.

A court heard that he invented a new name and identity whenever he contacted a fresh victim and managed to keep up the ruse for three years.

Kean used 19 aliases and five dates of birth to carry out his fraud.

Judge Ebrahim Mooncey jailed Kean for three years at Derby Crown Court and told him: 'You wormed your way into their lives.

'The effect on victims are that they say "my trust in mankind has gone as a result of what I experienced with him."

'You breached their trust and did it without emotion. It was spiteful and mean.'

Outside court, victim Catherine Smith, from County Durham, said: 'I have not seen him for three years and was glad to see him through bars.

'He told me his favourite meal was steak and ale pie. I bought one and he stole that from the fridge.

'He took my daughter Hannah's £180 birthday money and my car. We never realised he had gone until I came home, found the doors locked, the car missing and he was not answering the phone.'

Kean, who is homeless, took Ms Smith's laptop containing irreplaceable photographs of her parents' 50th wedding anniversary.

He told her his name was Jamie Patterson, that he had two daughters from a marriage and worked as a security man.

Alex Wolfson, prosecuting, said Kean contacted single women over websites like Flirtomatic, Match.com and Oasis.

Laura Finch, defending, said: 'He is sorry for how his actions have affected these ladies.'
