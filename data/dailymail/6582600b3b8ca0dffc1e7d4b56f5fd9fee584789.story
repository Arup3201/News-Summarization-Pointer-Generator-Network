Showbusiness stars have launched a campaign to save BBC3 from being turned into an online-only channel.

The corporation hopes to save tens of millions of pounds by slashing the youth-oriented station’s budget and moving its shows to the iPlayer internet service.

But presenters and comedians including Jack Whitehall and Richard Bacon have started a Twitter protest to block director general Tony Hall’s move.

BBC director-general Tony Hall last week said the BBC needed to make more cuts

Jack Whitehall, who wrote and starred in Bad Education on the channel, is one of a number of stars who has criticised the decision

Whitehall,
 who appears in the BBC3 comedy Bad Education, claimed the channel was 
vital for fostering new talent. Matt Lucas, who starred in Little 
Britain with David Walliams, said the reports of the channel’s imminent 
demise were ‘horrible’.

It 
is understood that Lord Hall plans to announce the online switch 
imminently. Earlier this week, the Daily Mail reported he was preparing 
to axe a channel to help meet a £100million-a-year savings target 
announced last year.

Putting
 BBC3 online would go a long way toward delivering the savings, which 
are designed to fund the BBC’s digital ambitions and are on top of 
existing cuts of £700million.

The
 corporation is expected to save money by reducing BBC3’s commissioning 
budget as well as cutting the money it spends on repeats and acquiring 
shows from outside companies. It will be forced to focus on making just a
 few dramas and comedy programmes for iPlayer rather than being expected
 to fill a 24-hour schedule.

Big break: Joanna Page and Mathew Horne in BBC3's Gavin and Stacey

Little Britain was one of the programmes which started on the channel and went on to become a huge success

The channel has been known to air a number of programmes with provocative titles, including Snog Marry Avoid?

Mark Lawson is leaving BBC Radio 4's Front Row programme after 16 years

Mark Lawson is leaving BBC Radio 4’s Front Row programme after 16 years for ‘personal reasons’.

His surprise departure comes just a month after the station’s arts unit, which makes the programme, was embroiled in a bullying row. It is not known whether the events are connected.

In a statement last night, the 51-year-old said: ‘The BBC and I have agreed that I should step down as presenter of Front Row and for personal reasons I shall be taking a break from live daily radio journalism. 

‘I very much hope to be able to return to work on Radio 4 in the future.’ 

Since the evening programme started in 1998, Mr Lawson has conducted more than 3,000 interviews, including with Helen Mirren, Robert De Niro and Woody Allen.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Front Row will continue to be presented by John Wilson and Kirsty Lang, alongside other guest presenters such as Tom Sutcliffe.’

Yesterday, BBC news reports about Mr Lawson’s departure prominently mentioned bullying complaints at the BBC’s radio arts unit, which makes Front Row, Saturday Review and The Film Programme.

However, there has been no suggestion Mr Lawson was involved in the incidents in any way and the BBC has refused to comment on the allegations.

In January, it was revealed the corporation had launched an investigation after 15 members of staff at the arts unit accused a presenter and a producer of bullying.

Lawson’s BBC Four interview show starts a new series next week.

In
 the 2012/13 financial year, the channel’s content budget was 
£90million, its infrastructure and support costs were £27million and the
 BBC spent another £4.6million distributing it to other platforms 
including Sky and Virgin.

It is not yet known whether the corporation will keep the BBC3 branding when it moves online.

Before
 it can make the changes, bosses will need to put the proposal to the 
BBC Trust. The long public consultation could be a stumbling block.

In 2010, the BBC was forced to abandon plans to axe Radio 6Music after its stars organised a vocal public protest.

Little Britain star Matt Lucas said the channel's closure would be 'really bad for new comedy'

Yesterday,
 Radio 5Live presenter Richard Bacon threatened to stage a similar 
campaign against the proposed BBC3 cut, saying: ‘BBC3 makes lots of 
great, clever, distinct programmes. If the rumours of it being cut are 
true, we might need to retool that 6Music campaign.’

Comedian
 Russell Kane, who regularly presents the BBC3 show Live at the 
Electric, claimed the channel was the ‘crucible of upcoming comedic 
artists’.

Presenter Greg 
James, who also regularly appears on the channel, said: ‘Such a load of 
balls if the rumours about BBC3 being axed are true. Brilliant new 
comedy and live music needs that platform.’

Mr
 Whitehall added: ‘I really hope reports that the BBC may kill BBC3 are 
just rumours. Their support of new comedy in particular is vital.’

Despite
 the protests of BBC staff, others have supported the proposal and 
expressed relief that Lord Hall will at least save BBC4. The high-brow 
station, which has an older audience, had been seen as the other main 
contender for the axe.

On 
the BBC’s online message board, Points of View, the overwhelming 
majority of viewers said they would prefer BBC3 to be scrapped rather 
than see BBC4 disappear. One said that BBC4, which mainly broadcasts 
documentaries and arts programmes, is ‘too good to go’, while another 
added: ‘BBC3 should go. Its programmes are pretty puerile.’

BBC3 was set up in 2003 and has launched comedies such as Little Britain and Gavin and Stacey.

But
 other programmes, such as Snog, Marry, Avoid?, have been less popular 
with critics, and it has been accused of showing endless repeats of 
EastEnders and films.

Its 
viewing figures are also much lower than other BBC channels, rarely 
topping 800,000, while its target audience of 16- to 34-year-olds watch 
more online television than older viewers.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘While nothing is off the table, no decisions have been made.’

BBC Three started broadcasting in 2003 and has been the launch pad for some of the corporation's biggest shows, along with some of its most controversial.

THE HITS

Gavin and Stacey - The sitcom story of an Essex boy and a Welsh girl's relationship started on the channel in 2007 before moving over to BBC1 where it became a massive mainstream hit and made stars of writing and acting duo Ruth Jones and James Corden.

Little Britain - The sketch show and its stars, David Walliams and Matt Lucas, made two series before moving over to BBC1 and even inspired an American version Little Britain USA.

Our War - The documentary, which used footage filmed by British soldiers on the front line in Afghanistan, won a TV Bafta last year.

THE MISSES

Anthea Turner: Perfect Housewife - The show which starred the former daytime TV favourite helping make hopeless housewives house-proud ran for three series.

Coming of Age - The BBC described the comedy as a 'frank look' at teenage life, but some people could not bear to look, with one critic calling it the 'worst sitcom ever'.

Sun, Sex and Suspicious Parents - The show followed teenagers on their first holidays without their parents, who were in fact following their every move with secret cameras. One newspaper accused it of blazing a 'vomit-flecked' trail for subsequent shows.
