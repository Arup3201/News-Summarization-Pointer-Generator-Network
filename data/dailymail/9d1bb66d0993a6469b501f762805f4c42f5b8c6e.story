Top plus-size model Melissa Aronson, better known as Emme, is making a return to fashion at the age of 51.

The former Fashion Emergency host, who battled and overcame Stage 2a Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2007, has recently been signed to Muse Models and is in the midst of launching several initiatives promoting the representation of plus size women in the fashion industry.

'Lululemon stops at size 12,' she told WWD as an example, explaining: 'If you want to get people healthy, you're going to need clothes to do it.'

One of Emme's current projects is Fashion Without Limits, which encourages design students at her alma mater Syracuse University to create apparel in size 12 and up.

The students will compete to create an evening dress for the model, with the winner receiving a $500 prize and the opportunity to see the design worn by Emme at a red carpet event.

'We wanted to go and educate the new designers and teach them how to drape on a large-size body, whether she's a little older or a more youthful junior,' says the mother-of-one, who has a 12-year-old daughter, Toby, with her ex-husband Philip.

Breaking boundaries: Emma became the first plus-size model signed to cosmetics brand Revlon in 1998

What's more, she also has plans to launch an athleticwear line that offers plus sizes, including swimwear, sportswear, knits and footwear.

'[Currently, most designers] just go up to 12 or 14. I don't know why,' she said. 'There might be a stigma that is undeniably present. It's really the unspoken truth. I see such an opportunity.'

She is also working with brand innovation firm Graj + Gustavsen on plus-size apparel and accessories. 

Emme says she does feel that the options and opportunities for plus-size women has grown since her modelling heyday in the Eighties and Nineties.

'The game is online for full-figured women. Major department stores are now playing that [online] game,' she said.

As for big brands who are making the most of the as of yet untapped market, Emme praises Michael Michael Kors, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Asos and Calvin Klein.

Despite all the progress, however, the fashion industry still has a ways to go.

'The whole plethora of personality is not being tapped,' she said. 'Just because she's a plus-size woman does not mean she is matronly.'
