If the Duchess of Cambridge and Kim Kardashian want to be prepared for the arrival of their impending babies, they'd better make sure they have at least £2,500 tucked away in the baby bank.

The cost of preparing for a newborn has shot up to to £2,547, and a significant proportion of parents-to-be are being forced to take out bank loans, borrow from families or use their savings just to afford the bare essentials, according to research.

Moreover, 30 per cent of parents worry about how they will pay these debts back, and 40 per cent are concerned about how they will be able to save for their children's future.

A new baby now costs, on average, £2,500... so let's hope Kate and William have a baby-shaped nest-egg tucked away somewhere in Kensington Palace

To combat the financial woes of new mothers and fathers, nursery retailer and  Mamas & Papas have launched a hand-picked list of the 21 crucial bits and pieces new arrivals require, all available for a total of £717.

The Baby Basics list features all the necessary items, from a cot and a car seat to a changing mat and an award-winning Luna pushchair. Plus smaller pieces such as mittens, bibs, onesies and sterilisers.

Olivia Robinson, Creative and 
Brand 
Director of Mamas & Papas and youngest daughter of David and Luisa 
(founders of Mamas & Papas) said: 'As parents we understand that 
mums and dads worry about what they need to buy for their new baby and 
how much it’s going to cost.

'We recognise that for many parents this is a
real challenge, so have used our experience to create the Mamas & 
Papas Baby Basics list.

'Parents can be assured that when they purchase 
the products on the list they are getting everything they need without 
breaking the bank!'

Mamas & Papas' research showed that 28 per cent of
new parents have needed to borrow money from their families to cover 
costs, 40 per cent have used their savings to cover daily essentials and
20 per cent have taken out a loan.

Further research revealed that parents are most likely to feel under financial pressure when their children are aged under two than at any other time.

Mothers and fathers of under-twos are also most likely to worry about their income and finances (56 per cent), argue about money with each other or their families (22 per cent), and see an increase in their household debts (19 per cent).

And 27 per cent of parents of under twos admit they've completely stopped saving as a result of having a family.
