Abuser: Dan Kirby Kopp, 45, would routinely beat his wife for being 'disrespectful' and not addressing him as 'sir'

A Pennsylvania man has been found guilty of beating his wife with a wooden spoon because she did not address him as 'sir'.

Dan Kirby Kopp lashed out at his wife when he found her 'disrespectful' towards him in front of their children.

The 45-year-old from Ephrata, Pennsylvania would routinely beat his now-estranged wife with the spoon or his hand, a court heard.

Kopp was filmed by his wife during a beating which took place in September 2012.

Jurors at Lancaster Country court were shown the tape where the 6ft5in 230lbs Kopp threatens his wife with a wooden paddle.

The
 video shows Kopp showing her the spoon and giving her a 'count of three
 to comply' with his demand of addressing him with a 'yes, sir' in front
 of the couple's children.

He is also heard threatening to 'cast the demons out of her' next time she disobeyed him.

According
 to charging documents, Kopp would regularly hold his wife down over his
 knee and spank her, so she would 'learn a lesson.'

One month after she filmed the abuse on 
her phone, Kopp's wife went to local police to report the regular 
beatings to the authorities.

She told officers he would abuse her as a 'means of disciplining her for disobedience to him for undermining his parenting,' The Lancaster New Era reports.

Kopp was convicted of misdemeanor stalking and harassment, following a 'cycle of abuse and intimidation', according to the charging documents.

Verdict: Kopp posted a response to the verdict on Tuesday after being found guilty of harassment

He was 
sentenced Tuesday to serve from one to 23 months in prison and one year of parole.

He has also been subjected to a restraining order and is not allowed to contact his wife.

As a result of the couple's young family, the judge also imposed that Kopp and his wife 
stay at least 50 yards apart from each other during school or sporting 
events.
