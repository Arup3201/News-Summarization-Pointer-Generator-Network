Martin Murray insists he is the only man who can topple Gennady Golovkin after he accepted the most daunting challenge in boxing.

The middleweight secured his shot at the Kazakh world champion with a messy victory over Domenico Spada in Monte Carlo on Saturday night.

The fight was stopped in the seventh round after Spada had been cut by a clash of heads with Murray ahead on all three scorecards when the referee called a halt.

Murray will face the much-feared Kazakh fighter Gennady Golovkin next

The St Helens man will return to the principality on February 21 for his third world title challenge.

'I feel I'm getting into my prime now and we go into this fight confident,' he said. 'I'm going into this fight with momentum and on the back of four wins.

'It's the biggest fight out there for me, why would I not want it? Of course it's the toughest fight out there. I'm the only one who can give him a challenge.

'When I turned professional I said I wanted to fight the best and see where I ended up and that's what I've done.

'I could swerve all these fights and stay at the level below but I'd never know how good I could be.'

Golovkin, who was ringside at the opulent Salle des Etoiles, has stopped his last 18 opponents and won all 31 of his professional fights.

Murray says he doesn't fear his opponent and will relish the opportunity

'If I want to be the best... I have to beat the best,' Murray said after his win in Monte Carlo

Murray has twice fallen short at the highest level, drawing with Felix Sturm in Germany before suffering a contentious defeat by Sergio Martinez last year.

'I want to fight the best and he is the best,' added Murray. 'It is a risky fight but with risk comes great opportunity.

'If any style can beat him its my style. I'm very versatile and I'm hard to hit. If you stand there and let him throw haymakers at you, he's going to chop you down.

'He's going to be fighting someone who's mentally strong. He's been built up like Mike Tyson in his heyday, people are half beat before they get in the ring.

'I did it when I fought Sturm, I did it when I fought Martinez and I'll do it again in February.'
