There may be a few male grumbles when women come home laden with pricey toiletries.

But disgruntled husbands might be better off not complaining about the bill - as according to a study, women pay far more for almost exactly the same items.

Research conducted by PriceSpy found they pay ‘substantially more’ for deodorant and electric shavers, with a mark-up of 34 and 26 per cent respectively for the products aimed at females.

Close behind was hair styling products, with a 24 per cent gap noted by the comparison website.

And other big differences between comparable items aimed at women were found for perfume or aftershave (21 per cent more), sunglasses (15 per cent) and bicycles for children (8 per cent).

Smaller variations were also discovered with watches (4 per cent) and trainers (3 per cent).

Bosses at PriceSpy compared 647,000 products from 1,900 retailers in Britain to find the differences in price for male and female products.

PriceSpy spokesman Erik Lorentz said: ‘The difference between the prices of male and female-branded products is both staggering and perhaps unfair when we consider the inequalities in pay.

‘Gendered shopping habits are something that retailers seem ready and willing to exploit, with many essentially unisex products marketed to men and women differently.

‘We hope that independent price comparison tools will empower consumers to combat these trends when shopping online.’

British men earn an average of £556 a week, compared to £459 a week among women - 20 per cent less, according to figures from the Office of National Statistics.
