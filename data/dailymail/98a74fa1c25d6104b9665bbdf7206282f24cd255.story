Leila McKinnon knows a good fight when she sees one.

The Channel 9 presenter and wife of David Gyngell - one half of last week's epic Bondi Beach brawl with billionaire James Packer - has taken to Twitter to cheekily point out the similarities between her husband's dust up and the one captured on CCTV between Solange Knowles and brother-in-law Jay Z.

And it seems McKinnon wishes her other half had the fashion sense of the American recording elite.

Funny gal: The Channel 9 presenter's tweet was described as 'gold' on social media

'Ok so they're much better dressed and a little more discreet but I feel a kinship with Beyonce, Solange, and Jay Z today,' she Tweeted this afternoon.

Two paparazzi captured Gyngell and Packer, clad in clothes more befitting of bums than billionaires, punching and rumbling down Sir Thomas Mitchell Road last Sunday after the Channel 9 boss confronted his friend of 35 years outside the Packer mansion.

On Monday morning (US time) TMZ posted a sensational video captured on security cameras inside an elevator of New York's Standard Hotel last week.

It shows Solange Knowles (sister of Beyonce) wildly attacking Jay Z after the Met Gala after party, requiring burly security guards to break up the fracas.

Keen observes will note a number of striking similarities between the fight and the one which gripped Australia for days.

The combined wealth of Jay Z and his superstar wife is reportedly approaching $1 billion (Aus). Solange Knowles is also not short of cash and was probably as close to Jay Z as Gyngell is to Packer, who's relationship may well have frosted over slightly after last week's events.

McKinnon's light-hearted stab at her husband and his once best man was well received by her Twitter followers and has so far been retweeted more than 80 times.

Today producer Marietta Del Vecchio joked on Twitter: 'clearly you're Beyonce right?!'. McKinnon, who retweeted the post, obviously agreed with the sentiment.

There are even more overlaps in the 'kinship' McKinnon feels with the musical royalty aside from the fact that both sides boast brawling ultra-rich people.

Last year it was reported that Beyonce Knowles was 'arguing' with her mother Tina because she was dating a Scientologist. James Packer's former links with the church, especially through mate Tom Cruise, are well-known.

Leila McKinnon has been approached for comment.

A Channel 9 publicist said: 'Leila is on maternity leave and not doing interviews as such...she really doesnâ€™t have anything to add.'

James Packer and David Gyngell were both slapped with $500 fines for offensive behaviour, penalties that are unlikely to hurt either the casino baron or the boss of the Nine Network.

Unlike the two men - who both bunkered down in the days following their jaw-dropping altercation - Jay Z and Solange Knowles have been spotted out and about in recent days.

Neither seemed fazed by the elevator rumble, with Jay Z sporting a wide grin at the basketball with wife Beyonce on Monday night and Solange tweeting that same day: 'This might have been top 10 days ever in life.'
