German police say they helped American skier Lindsey Vonn get to Bulgaria for a World Cup event after she forgot her passport in Austria.

Munich airport police say Vonn realised after arriving Wednesday for a flight to Sofia that she had left her passport in Salzburg, which is an 11-hour drive away. 

They say officers at the airport issued an emergency travel document for the 30-year-old American that allowed her to take her flight.

A World Cup super-G and a combined event will be held in Bansko, Bulgaria, this weekend.

It's been a tricky few weeks for Vonn, who broke down in tears after being disqualified from the skiing world championships in Colorado combined race on Tuesday.

Vonn made several mistakes and wound up 2.67 seconds behind the leaders during the first run of the event. 

Vonn is the girlfriend of golfer Tiger Woods but has had a tricky month on the slopes
