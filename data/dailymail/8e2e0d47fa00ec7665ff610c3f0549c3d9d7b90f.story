British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton has vowed his track squad will be ready for the Rio in two years despite playing second fiddle to Australia at the Commonwealth Games.

Since Team GB ruled the velodrome at London 2012 they have slipped back, disappointing at the World Championships in Cali while Australia were well ahead of the home nations in Glasgow - topping the medal table with seven golds and 20 in total.

Sutton's England team managed nine overall, with golds for Joanna Rowsell and Laura Trott, as well as two wins for Sophie Thornhill and Helen Scott in the para-sport tandem rides.

The British tally was boosted by five medals for Scotland, three for Wales and one silver for the Isle of Man's Pete Kennaugh, but there was no escaping the formidable statement laid down by Australia and 11-medal New Zealand.

Sutton, though, has vowed to get his riders to peak performance for 2016.

'Ultimately there were some dominant performances from the Aussies and the Kiwis which you would expect knowing the importance of this event to them, which I do being an Aussie myself,' said Sutton, now heading up British Cycling since Sir Dave Brailsford stepped down.

'But we know how to get it right. We've been there and done that.

'We came here to represent England and to win and I think, given where we were at this year's World Championships, we've done Team England proud.

'There are a lot of positives going forward, as well as some riders who didn't perform as well as they'd have liked.

'But there's no doubt we will be ready. Whether we'll win in Rio, I don't know, but we will be ready.

'We have the 'Rio Ready Mission' by January 1. From January we'll really nail our focus on everything about Rio and from this competition we've learned a lot.

'I don't feel like there is a lot we can criticise here.'

The overall picture was lifted by Trott's thrilling points race gold on the final day at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome - heading up a British one, two, three in front of Wales' Elinor Barker and Scotland's Katie Archibald.

Sutton denied the double Olympic champion, who had been struggling with a kidney infection, had spared the squad's blushes with her late success but was effusive in his praise for the 22-year-old.

'I wouldn't say it saved face, it just showed when it matters the great ones step up,' he said.

'Expectation is one of the things that kills Laura at times. She finds it tough, she thinks the crowd expects. She was putting too much pressure on herself.

'I just said to her "it's all about Rio for you, have some fun".

Gold: England's Joanna Rowsell came out on top in the 3,000m individual pursuit cycling final

'The different between Laura winning and losing is whether she is smiling or not.

'That came back. You saw that little girl bend her back down the straight and that's the difference between good and great.

'Look at our big players (double silver medallist) Jason Kenny, Trott...they're not million miles away.

'Having them on board and heading in the right direction is good.'
