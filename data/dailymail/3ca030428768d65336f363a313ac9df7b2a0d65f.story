Frustrated: Chairman of Chelsea Bruce Buck

Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck has admitted Roman Abramovich is 'frustrated' at the club's form in an email reply to a fan who demanded the Chelsea board sack Rafa Benitez.

Benitez has been interim manager at Stamford Bridge since Roberto Di Matteo was axed in November but Blues supporters have staged protests against the Spaniard's appointment from the start.

Supporter Dan Silver, in an email to Buck which has been posted on the SweetFA football forums website, criticised Benitez for his views on Chelsea during his time as Liverpool boss and the job he has done since arriving in west London.

New York-born Buck, 66, wrote in his reply: 'The Board and Roman are as frustrated as
you are with some of the recent results.'

Silver wrote: 'His anti-Chelsea diatribes will not be forgotten, it was always going to be an uphill struggle for him but the inept displays, the inept substitutions and tactics and the inability to change a match when teams come and defend is simply not good enough.

'His presence at the club is divisive, the true fans are angry and upset, he is hindering our progress. We have some outstanding talent at the club, we just need the right man to take us forward - Rafa is not that man.

'He was unemployed for two years post Inter, which to me suggests that he can't cut the mustard, top coaches are not out of work for long unless it's by choice.

'In my humble opinion Rafa should go before he does too much damage.'

Silver finished by questioning whether Buck would read or acknowledge the email.

But the Chelsea chairman replied: 'Thank you for your email. Contrary to your expectation, I have read it.

'You will appreciate that I cannot respond to the specific points you raise but the Board and Roman are as frustrated as you are with some of the recent results. We are all working as hard as we can to change things around.

'I hope you will continue your support of the club as the boys really need your backing now.'

Chelsea have drawn four of their last five games after throwing away a two-goal lead against Reading on Wednesday night. They sit third in the Barclays Premier League table, 13 points behind leaders Manchester United.

A club official this afternoon confirmed the authenticity of the email exchange and that chairman Buck attempts to respond to as much supporters' correspondence as possible.
