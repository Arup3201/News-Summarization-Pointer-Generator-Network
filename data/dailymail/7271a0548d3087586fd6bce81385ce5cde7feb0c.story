Forget the drive-thru, now you can eat your Big Mac and fries at an air-mazing McDonald's restaurant on this decommissioned aircraft.

For the last 24 years the disused DC-3 plane has been parked beside the McDonald's restaurant in Taupo, New Zealand.

The grounded passenger plane, with its refurbished red and silver interior and seating for 20, is very much a part of the restaurant and customers can enjoy their meal within the comfort of the cabin.

The DC-3 plane was sat redundant for 24 years but has now been given a new lease of life as part of the McDonald's restaurant

Eileen Byrne, the restaurant's 59-year-old owner, says: 'The site was previously part of a car dealership, the Aeroplane Car Company, and the owner bought a disused DC-3 plane, which sat alongside the building.

'And when McDonald's purchased the site in 1990, the aeroplane came with it.

The DC-3 plane has been painted in traditional McDonald's colours, with the company's iconic lettering on the exterior, too. 

The captain hasn't switched the seat belt sign on:  No need for safety on this plane which is now home to 20 seats for hungry passengers

Put out to pasture: The plane retired to McDonald's after flying for 56,282 hours during its working life

Diners can access the plane via a flight of stairs near the tail, and the public must go through the restaurant in order to enter the aircraft.

While the engines have been removed, the plane's propellers are still intact and the cockpit has been left in its original state, much to the delight of diners.

We have lift off: The planes propellers and cockpit are still intact but the engines have been removed 

Eileen said: 'We have a locked clear perspex door, preventing access and to ensure that items, such as the knobs on the joystick, are not 'removed for collection' purposes.

'However, we are happy to open the cockpit for enthusiasts and to take photos for them.

'There is a storyboard which explains the plane's history and photographs of her years in service.

'The plan was, and still is, to keep the appearance of the plane as original as possible.'

The cockpit has been left in its original state but doors are locked to ensure the equipment remains intact

If customers or enthusiasts want to take a proper look, the doors can be opened for photographs to be taken

Built in 1943, the plane was one of three used by New Zealand's South Pacific Airlines from 1961 to 1966

The history of the DC-3 plane, which was decommissioned in 1984, can be found inside the aircraft 

The plane, a Douglas DC-3 aircraft, was built in 1943 and was one of three used by New Zealand's South Pacific Airlines from 1961 to 1966.

In 1971 it was renamed Whio and used by Fieldair Holdings as a top-dressing plane, before being decommissioned in 1984.

After retiring from the skies the plane was placed in storage, having flown 56,282 hours during its working life.
