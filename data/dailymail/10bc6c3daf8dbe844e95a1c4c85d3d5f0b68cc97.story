A 13-year-old girl who turned her back on an acting career today followed in her hero Tom Daley's footsteps to become one of the youngest English athletes to compete at the Commonwealth Games.

Diver Victoria Vincent, nicknamed VV Voom, is the youngest member of Team England who today competed in the Women's 10m Platform final tonight and etched her name into the history books.

A podium finish was beyond her grasp despite an impressive performance, made all the more so considering some of the athletes she was competing against have more than a decade of experience over her.

She finished 10th out of 12 but this competition certainly won't be the last that is heard from this burgeoning talent.

Diver Victoria Vincent is to make history as one of the youngest English athletes to compete at the games

The London-born swimmer, who now lives in Plymouth and trains at the country's elite diving programme, turned her back on gymnastics, swimming and a burgeoning acting career in order to pursue the sport.

Earlier today she qualified for the finals after finishing eighth in the preliminaries with a total score of 297.30.

She and her mother now live in Plymouth, 
the home of British diving, after her talent was spotted by Daley's dive
 coach Andy Banks in 2012.

The opportunity was too good to pass up - he offered to tutor her through Plymouth's elite diving programme.

Her father Ray, 53, remains in London where he works as a London Underground train driver and visits his wife and daughter every few weeks.

He told The Telegraph:
 'The great thing is that Andy recognises that there is life after 
diving, so he knows she has to apply herself at school as well.

'Fortunately, she’s very bright, pretty much straight As in everything, which probably comes from that competitiveness as well.'

She recently told The Guardian of her promising prospects as an actor, which she has now put aside to focus on her diving.

'I
 didn’t really take an interest in it after I found sport,' she said. 
'It didn’t seem as fun as it used to be. Sport has a bit more of a zing 
and zang, if that’s how you say it.'

Unlike most other 13-year-olds, the 
teenager's Twitter page is littered with selfies, pictures and tweets of
 her with England athletes and established superstars such as Sir 
Bradley Wiggins.

But her most prized possession remains 'my teddy bear and my reading books', according to her swimming biography.

And following a career path forged by 
Daley, who rose to stardom after competing at the 2008 Beijing Olympics 
at the age of 14, Vincent has carved out a reputation with a series of 
promising results despite taking up the sport only a few years ago.

However, her road to the Glasgow Commonwealth Games has not been an easy one.

After
 winning the 10m title at the British Championships in June, games 
organisers initially said she was too young to compete.

Rules
 set by FINA, the sport's international governing organisation, state 
athletes must be in the year of their 14th birthday to compete at the 
Olympics or other international competitions.

But an appeal lodged by Team England, on the basis other 13-year-olds have competed - was successful.

The appeal victory led to excitement for both Team England and Vincent.

She tweeted: 'I am glad to say that after the long appeal I've been told I can go to Commonwealth Games!! I'm over the moon!'

Team
 England Chef de Mission Jan Paterson said: 'I am delighted that 
Victoria has been included in our diving squad and I'd like to thank the
 CGF for their support in this matter.

'Victoria will be our youngest member of Team England and a welcome addition to our diving team.'
