Young Putin supporters also were out on sections of the central ring road, although some people refused to take their Pro-Putin ribbons

Thousands of protesters held hands to form a 10-mile (16 kilometre) human chain around Moscow's historic city centre today in one of the most spectacular opposition demonstrations yet against Vladimir Putin.

People linked hands around the inside of the Garden Ring, the circular road that defines central Moscow to show their support for fair elections.

The aim was to keep up the pressure on Putin who was Russia's president from 2000 to 2008, and is running for a third, now six-year term in a March 4 election.

Unity: More than 30,000 peaceful protesters held hands to form a ten-mile human chain around central Moscow

Determined: The demonstrators want to keep up the pressure on Putin as he prepares to extend his rule for six more years

Defence: Police officers block the central square next to the Kremlin during the opposition protest

Pro-Putin: Supporters of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin with banners reading 'Putin loves everyone' and 'A week before Putin's victory' stand on the other side of the street during a opposition protest in Moscow

The protest appeared to have drawn close to the 34,000 people that opposition activists estimated were needed to complete the chain.

But as with previous demonstrations the police put an estimated attendance at a lower 10,000 protestors, but local media, who worked out there were roughly two people per metre all around the road's 9.3 mile circumference, estimated that as many as 30,000 took part.

Almost all of the people standing in the wet snow wore the white ribbons that have become a symbol of the peaceful anti-Putin protest movement.

But young Putin supporters also were out on sections of the Garden Ring on Sunday.

Supporters of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin also took to the streets, with 
banners reading 'Putin loves everyone' and 'A week before Putin's 
victory.'

Some passers-by refused to take the pro-Putin ribbons, which had stripes of white, blue and red like the national flag.

Putin is expected to win easily against 
four Kremlin-approved challengers, but an unprecedented wave of protests
 has undermined his image as a strong leader who rules with broad public
 support.

Out in force: Sunday's protest appeared to have drawn close to the 34,000 people that opposition activists estimated were needed to complete the chain along the Garden Ring

Protests: The demonstrations began in December following a parliamentary election that saw widespread vote rigging to boost the results for Putin's party

Symbol: The protest ended with the activists releasing bunches of white balloons

Protest: A man with a dog wearing a white ribbon, holds a poster with a crossed-out portrait of Vladimir Putin and words reading 'Betrayed the Russian people' as he stands at Garden Ring avenue

The Garden Ring was the scene of 
protests on two previous Sundays, when hundreds of people drove cars 
decorated with white ribbons and balloons as others waved from the 
sidewalks and overpasses as they went by, horns blaring.

The
 demonstrations have helped the protest movement maintain momentum 
between the huge rallies in Moscow that have drawn tens of thousands of 
people.

The protests 
began in December following a parliamentary election that saw widespread
 vote rigging to boost the results for Putin's party.

Many
 Russians were already angry over Putin's announcement in September 
that he and President Dmitry Medvedev intended to swap jobs.

The presidential election was presented as a formality.

No
 longer willing to tolerate Putin's system of 'managed democracy,' the 
protesters have demanded fair elections in which opposition candidates 
are free to take part. Some protesters have called for Putin to step 
down.

After
 the demonstration ended, about 1,000 of the activists moved to a square
 near the Kremlin to hold a Russian version of pancake day, called Maslenitsa, and 10 people were arrested.

'We believe that Russia will not withstand six more years of political winter,' opposition leader Sergei Udaltsov said.

'Everything will freeze completely. Therefore, we have to do everything we can to prevent that.'

The protest ended with the activists releasing bunches of white balloon.
