A California company has launched an ad campaign that features billboards showing a U.S. soldier embracing a woman masked in a burka.

The campaign, launched by the sleep-aid company Snore Stop, includes the Twitter hashtag '#betogether.'

Company spokesperson Melody Devemark says the campaign is designed to prompt conversation about stereotypes.

'We wanted to find locations that would grab people's attention. 
Snore Stop is a product for couples and we want to show couples that you
normally don't see in advertising,' Devemark told CBS Los Angeles.

The billboards have gone up in Hollywood, including one on Sunset Boulevard.

Snore Stop bills itself as a 'woman-owned' company that is designed to help keep couples together by helping them sleep more peacefully.

The company's website features testimonials from several non-traditional couples - including same-sex partnerships - who describe how Snore Stop has helped their relationships.

The billboard, however, has led to some controversy from people who think the company is exploiting the image of a U.S. serviceman and a Muslim woman to sell a seemingly unrelated product.

'It's a shock factor....Trying to shock you into looking at it. But to each their own," onlooker Jan Clair told the station.

Devemark, however, disagrees.

'People feel that we are trying to misuse the image of military 
servicemen. I think they don't understand that there are couples like 
this that do exist. It's just that you're not used to seeing them,' she 
said.

The company says it plans to expand the campaign to 20 other cities, including Houston, Salt Lake City and New York.
