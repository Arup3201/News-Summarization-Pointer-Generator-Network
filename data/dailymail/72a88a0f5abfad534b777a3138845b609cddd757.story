At the weekend Dominique Strauss-Kahn was celebrating his release from house arrest with truffles and fine wine in an expensive New York restaurant.

The rape case brought against him by a hotel chambermaid was on the brink of collapse.

But if the former head of the International Monetary Fund thought he was in the clear and could now take a run at the French presidency, yesterday brought a new setback.

New battle: Strauss-Kahn with his wife Anne Sinclair

French journalist Tristane Banon accused 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn of attempting to rape her in 2003.

Miss Banon says she was ‘sickened’ to
see photographs of the economist and his wife Anne Sinclair toasting 
the apparent collapse of the New York case. She says she was attacked by
Strauss-Kahn in a Paris studio flat, with him acting like a  ‘rutting 
chimpanzee’ as he tried to pull her clothes off.

Miss Banon’s lawyer David Koubbi 
confirmed that her complaint – which will be received by prosecutors on 
Wednesday – was ‘extremely solid and well documented’. He added: ‘We 
won’t let go.’

Attempted rape carries a sentence of 
up to 15 years in France – more if there are aggravating circumstances 
such as the use of violence.

In an interview with L’Express magazine, Miss Banon recounted the alleged attack when she went to interview Strauss-Kahn.

‘When I entered that flat, I immediately felt ill at ease,’ she said, adding that the flat was almost empty.

Ms Banon says she was dissuaded from filing charges at the time of the alleged attack by her mother, a regional councillor in Mr Strauss-Kahn's Socialist party

‘He offered me a coffee, I got out my
Dictaphone, he wanted us to go on the couch, then asked me to hold his 
hand, saying “Otherwise I won’t manage”.

‘I wanted to leave. He stopped the 
Dictaphone, caught me by the arm. I asked him to let me go, and that’s 
when the fight started.’

Miss Banon has previously given a 
graphic account of the alleged attack in a 2007 TV programme, still 
posted on the internet, in which she used the ‘rutting chimpanzee’ 
description. She said her attacker tried to unfasten her clothes.

She said that she was dissuaded from 
filing charges at the time by her mother, a regional councillor in 
Strauss-Kahn’s Socialist party.

Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers responded to 
the allegations by saying he intended to sue Miss Banon for ‘slanderous 
denunciation’, adding that the alleged events she related were 
‘imaginary’.

He was arrested in New York in May on charges that he tried to rape the hotel maid, but was released without bail last week.

It has now been claimed that the maid
– who has been accused of working as a prostitute – was aware of 
Strauss-Kahn’s VIP status and became angry when he refused to pay for 
sexual services.

A New York police source said the 
eventual dismissal of charges was ‘a certainty’, adding: ‘We all know 
this case is not sustainable.’

The French Socialist Party has been 
torn apart by the latest revelations, with some senior figures still 
arguing that Strauss-Kahn should be allowed to run for president next 
year against Nicolas Sarkozy.
