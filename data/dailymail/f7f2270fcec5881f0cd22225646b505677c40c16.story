Marko Marin is due to have a medical with Fiorentina over the next 48 hours after agreeing terms on a loan.

The 25-year-old spent last season on loan with Sevilla but the Germany international could join Fiorentina permanently for £4.2m if all goes well. 

Chelsea agreed to sign Marin from Werder Bremen in 2012 and he joined up with the squad during the summer, after they won the Champions League.

He was part of the squad for the successful Europa League campaign, though he struggled to claim a first-team spot ahead of the likes of Eden Hazard and Oscar.  

Fiorentina have interest from Barcelona and Manchester United in winger Juan Cuadrado who has asked to leave. 

Chelsea have also been linked with the Colombia international.
