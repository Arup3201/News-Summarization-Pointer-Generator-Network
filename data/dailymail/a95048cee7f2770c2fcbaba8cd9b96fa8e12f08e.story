You probably have to go back to that unforgettable back nine meltdown at the Masters in 2011 to find the last time Rory McIlroy had a 30 minute collapse to rival the one he suffered at the DP World Tour Championship on Saturday.

One minute he was making birdies for fun to be tied for the lead with defending champion Henrik Stenson. This brilliant European Tour season looked for all the world like it would get the Sunday showdown between the pair it deserved.

Then came that half-hour of madness, as almost unbelievably the world number one followed one double bogey with another. In 30 minutes he had gone from co-leader to outside the top ten. Seeing him get one double bogey – his first in 220 holes at the Earth Course – was shocking enough but two in a row was positively jaw-dropping.

At the 12th, he three-putted and then short-sided himself badly with a wild tee shot at the 13th. Trust McIlroy to bounce back from those four dropped shots at the 12th and 13th with a birdie at the 14th and another at the 18th. But those costly lapses have left him with an awful lot to do if he is to end this amazing campaign with one more victory.

The 25-year-old had to settle for a 70 and, on another day of low scoring, that’s left him four shots adrift of the co-leaders, Stenson and Rafa Cabrera-Bello. 

McIlroy made up seven strokes to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in May and spark his remarkable summer. But it will be some feat to make up such a sizable deficit against an opponent as formidable as the Swede on a course that suits him to a tee.

Stenson recovered from his troubles in the bunker to lead the course at the end of the third round 

‘I’m obviously a bit frustrated at the minute about those double bogeys but at least the late birdies mean I’m not out of it,’ said McIlroy. ‘The idea on Sunday will be to play aggressively and go at the pins and try to post a low score.’

As for Stenson, he said: ‘At the end of the year we always look at trophies and it would mean an awful lot to me to defend this title for my first win this season.’

The one thing that will give McIlroy encouragement is there are only three players ahead of him. Stenson and Cabrera-Bello are three shots ahead of Justin Rose on eleven under – and then comes McIlroy on ten under, alongside three other players in Frenchman Victor Dubuisson, Dane Thorbjorn Olesen and rising English rookie Tyrrell Hatton.

Stenson will start as clear favourite given he’s ranked number four in the world and loves this Earth course. But Spaniard Cabrera-Bello deserves high credit for a stunning comeback from an opening round of 73 that appeared to rule out any chance of winning. 

How he has responded, following a 64 on Friday with a 65 on Saturday. Similarly, Rose has bounced back from being four over par after 10 holes on Thursday to give himself an opportunity to clinch his third victory of the year.

Dubuisson was third in this event last season and again showed his liking for the course with a 67.

And how about Hatton? The 23 year old Englishman appears to have been pipped for the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year prize by exciting American Brooks Koepka, who won the Turkish Airlines Open last week. But that could all change if he can piece together the best round of his career on Sunday.

‘I think I would have to win the event to win the rookie race as well but who knows what might happen if I can hole a few putts on the back nine,’ said Hatton. ‘It’s still a bit weird for me seeing my name next to the likes of Rory and Henrik, so I’ll have to make sure I keep my emotions in check.’

Scot Marc Warren and Danny Willett from England will start the final round five in arrears after rounds of 65 and 71 respectively.
