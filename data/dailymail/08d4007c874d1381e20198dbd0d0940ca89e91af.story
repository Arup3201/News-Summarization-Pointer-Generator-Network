Natasha Corrett had struggled with 'every single diet there is' for years, watching her weight bob up and down and never understanding why she always felt so tired and bloated.

A chance visit to an Ayurvedic Acupuncturist after injuring her back revealed her symptoms as 'acidic', and she was put on a two-week eating plan of oily fish, green tea, whole grains, green vegetables and almonds.

She cut out fizzy drinks (including soda water and tonic), sugar, sweeteners, peanuts, white flours and chocolate - and in under a year she lost two stone and shrunk by two dress sizes.

Four years later, Natasha - who is Sienna Miller's step-sister - now runs the Honestly Healthy food company with her godmother, nutritionist Vicki Edgson, delivering home-cooked alkaline meals to celebrities including Robbie Williams, Kelly Holmes, Lisa Snowdon, Natalie Imbruglia and swimwear designer Melissa Odabash.

WIlliams has called her food 'healthy yet ridiculously delicious', and Odabash has said: 'I can eat tillmy hearts content and still look great in my bikinis!"

And now Natasha and Vicki's's new book, Honestly Healthy: Eat With Your Body In Mind, The Alkaline Way', has received online praise from Victoria Beckham who tweeted her love for the recipe bible earlier this month.

Speaking to MailOnline, Natasha said: 'The thing we really want to stress as much as possible is that this is not a diet - it's a healthy way of eating. The whole reason for creating it was to get out of faddy diets.

'The alkaline eating plan is about getting your body into the optimum state it can be in - and alkaline is healthier than acidic.

'When your body is alkaline you have clear skin, greater concentration, shiny hair - all the things you want with the bonus of weight loss.'

Did you know that a lemon when digested is alkaline? And that cows milk when digested is acidic? But when tested on the PH scale both are the opposite?

Food groups behave differently in the body – some provide energy (carbohydrates), whilst others are the very rebuilding and repairing blocks of our bodies and brains (proteins) – and yet others feed our neurological systems, regulate our hormones, and protect us against damage and disease (essential fats).

How these foods behave in the body is broken down into two classes – acid and alkaline. Our bodies function best when in an overall alkaline state, PH 7.365 and yet much of our current eating trends and diets are very acid-forming in the body, leading to internal stress on the digestive and other systems.

Our bodies do amazing things with food – its our fuel, so why feed it with something that doesn’t make it perform at its optimum?  Here at HH we want to show you how to feel at your best all the time without compromising on taste and all those treats.

The basis of Honestly Healthy is that you stick to alkaline foods - green vegetables, almonds, garlic, olive oil, lemons, tea - and cut out acidic foods such as oats, milk, chicken and rhubarb.

'But only 70 per cent of the time,' assures Natasha. 'The idea is that it's a lifestyle, not a diet, so you follow the rules only 70 per cent of the time. 30 per cent of the time you can eat normal, gluten pizza, chocolate and wine. Everyone needs to have a life and go to the pub now and then!

'The best thing is that when you do go back to eating all these things 30 per cent of the time, you won't feel as good as when you don't eat them at all. Which means you therefore eat them less and the weight falls of naturally.'
