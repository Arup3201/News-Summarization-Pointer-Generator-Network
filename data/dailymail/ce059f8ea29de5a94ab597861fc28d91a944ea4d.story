Tragic: Keith Bandy died after a paramedic refused to treat him while he was suffering a severe asthma attack

A trainee driving instructor was left to die on his kitchen floor after an experienced paramedic failed to spot signs he was having a severe asthma attack, an inquest has heard.

Keith Bandy, 30, dialled 999 after falling critically ill at his Northampton home in 2010. 

Clive Leach, 69, from East Midlands Ambulance Service, arrived at the scene but left after just 16 minutes, refusing to assess Mr Bandy because he was being 'uncooperative'.

But, the victim's reluctance to let the medic treat him may have been an indication he was suffering a severe shortage of oxygen.

The paramedic of 43 years also left vital life-saving equipment in his car and failed to test the amount of oxygen in the patient's body, despite his severe breathing problems.

Mr Leach then left the property in Northampton because he was not concerned for Mr Bandy's health as he did not look 'pale or clammy'.

But just an hour after Mr Leach left Mr Bandy alone his mother Avril, 66 found him collapsed on the kitchen floor and he died two hours later.

An inquest at Northampton County Hall heard the trainee driving instructor’s life could probably have been saved if had simply been taken to hospital.

Northamptonshire Coroner Anne Pember 
said: 'There was a failure to determine whether Keith Bandy’s lack of 
co-operation was due to hypoxia or any other medical condition or 
whether he was just being non-compliant.

'There was also a failure to measure Keith Bandy’s oxygen saturation which could be vital in assessing a patients’ respiratory level.

'On the balance of probabilities, if Keith Bandy had been given appropriate treatment and been conveyed to hospital it is likely he would have survived.'

The two-day inquest heard that when Mr Leach attended the 'category A' 999 call he twice failed to get Mr Bandy to blow into a peak flow meter.

After failing to blow hard enough, Keith 'threw himself' onto his bed and 'shrugged away' Mr Leach’s hand.

The paramedic then called his control room before leaving the property.

Giving evidence at the hearing Mr Leach told the family: 'May I say I feel dreadful.

'I can’t imagine how you feel. For your loss I am very sorry.'

Career: Mr Bandy was training to be a driving instructor before he passed away

Discovered: Avril Bandy, 66, found her son collapsed on the kitchen floor after he had been abandoned by the medic

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Leach, who has since retired, added: 'It is incredibly sad and distressing what has happened.

'In my experience, he did not cause me concern from his physical signs.

'I made a decision and it has turned into a very sad state of affairs and as I hope the family can now get some peace.

'I have been going over what happened for the last three years, thinking, maybe I could have done things differently.

'I wished he spoke to me, but he didn’t and I will have to live with that.'

Dr
David Sprigings, a heart consultant at Northampton General Hospital, 
said he believed Mr Bandy would have survived if he had been taken to 
hospital for treatment straight away.

Independent medical expert, Mark Ainsworth-Smith, compiled a report for the coroner and also concluded he had concerns about the 'quality of care' the patient had received.

The coroner told the family she would be writing to East Midlands Ambulance Service - which was branded as the UK’s worst performing trust earlier this year.

They were placed at the bottom of a league table measuring response times and launched an investigation this year into the deaths of 13 patients, including one person who died after an ambulance took four hours to reach them.

After the case Mr Bandy's devastated mother, Avril, added: 'Keith was diagnosed with asthma from a very early age and it affected him throughout life.

'His passion was driving, he could do that just like everyone else and was training to be a driving instructor.

'My son was very special, he was a big family man, he would visit everyone and would be there to help whenever anyone needed something.

'His death has affected the family badly and he is sorely missed.

'It has taken three and a half years to get to the point we are at now and things do not get any easier, we miss him dearly.'

East Midlands Ambulance service have been approached for a comment but have not yet responded.
