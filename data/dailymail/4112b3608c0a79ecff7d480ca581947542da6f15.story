The trip will begin with a visit to Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort in Finland where guests will be able to see the spectacular Northern Lights while staying in a glass igloo

Billed as a trip ‘like no other’, it has been arranged by luxury travel specialists Hurlingham Travel, who have just been shortlisted for The Luxury Travel Agency of The Year Award.

The itinerary will begin with a trip to the Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort in Finland where guests will be able to see the spectacular Northern Lights while staying in a glass igloo.

From there it is off to Petra in Jordan, the only ancient city in the world that is part hewn from rock wall. It is iconic and instantly recognisable in part due to its starring role in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

The next stop on the journey is Turkmenistan’s ‘Door to Hell’ - the world’s only burning natural gas field. It was created after Soviet geologists, who were drilling at the site in 1971, tapped into a cavern filled with natural gas. 

In an effort to prevent the poisonous gases escaping they set it alight in the hope of burning it off. It is still burning more than 40 years later.

The fourth destination is Madagascar and a visit to see the unique and endangered Adansonia Grandidieri tree.

The tour will then travel to the Keibul Lamjao National Park in India, giving travellers the chance to see the rare and endangered Sangai deer, before a trip to see China’s Terracotta Army.

The collection of sculptures that depict the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China, is a form of funerary art that was buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE and wasn’t rediscovered until 1974.
