Former England captain Tony Adams hits out at Roy Hodgson for not begging Terry to come out of retirement.

Adams also told The Sun on Sunday that his former England manager Terry Venables, who led the Three Lions to the semi-finals of Euro '96, would have tried to lure a man of Terry's quality out of the international wilderness.

The Arsenal legend played 66 times for England in a 13-year spell across three seperate decades, including appearances at Euro '96, the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.

Wilderness: John Terry should have been persuaded out of international retirement, according to Tony Adams

Leader: Adams captained England at Euro '96 and played at the World Cup in 1998

‘The best defender in the country is John Terry. He’s 33, not 36,' said Adams.

‘I would definitely have tried to convince John to come out of retirement.

‘A boss like Terry Venables would have been straight on the phone to John.

‘There is the argument that if Roy is not taking John and Ashley (Cole), then why take Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard?’
