Just imagine what the big boys of European football will do to Arsenal if they can limp through to the next phase of the Champions League. They will chew them up and spit them out.

Before it all gets a bit complicated, this Arsenal team were leading three zip and playing like champions thanks to the enduring charm of Alexis Sanchez. Now they look like chumps.

How they came to draw it 3-3, combusting in front of a nervy and anxious crowd at the Emirates, will take a separate inquest all of its own. What a shambles this Arsenal team can be at times.

Ratings by ROB DRAPER at The Emirates  

Aleksandar Mitrovic, a second half substitute, scored Anderlecht’s dramatic equaliser when he headed beyond Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny. It was incredible to witness.

‘Clueless,’ was the brutal assessment of former Arsenal forward Paul Merson, sitting in the TV studio, when he was asked about Arsene Wenger’s role in this capitulation.

The Gunners know of no other way to play. They will never learn, that much is clear.

‘They tried to score a fourth and at 3-2 you see Arsenal start to have a bit of doubt,’ declared Anderlecht coach Besnik Hasi.

He and Wenger did not shake hands at the final whistle because Hasi was too busy cavorting on the pitch with his wild-eyed players tearing off those fetching purple shirts.

‘It doesn’t hurt me if I don't get his hand. We come from a small competition and we can only imagine playing these teams. Maybe Arsenal wanted to have fun with their public.’ 

Arsenal were booed off at the final whistle by their increasingly frustrated supporters and it was tempting to join in with them.

‘It was a poor defensive performance,’ admitted Wenger. ‘At 3-0 we thought the job was done. We got punished, we under-estimated Anderlecht sub-consciously.’ No kidding. 

To be this far ahead, thanks to goals from Mikel Arteta, Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, and press the self-destruct button really is something else.

‘We threw everything away,’ admitted Arteta, who has torn his hamstring and will miss Sunday’s trip to Swansea. ‘This is not the standard required.’ 

After Anthony Vanden Borre scrambled Anderlecht’s opening goal, the gods were with the Belgian champions.

Hasi’s side, battered in the opening 45 minutes, played on the nerves and anxiety that transmits into the stands whenever Arsenal concede a soft goal.

Whatever training drills this defence does - if any - during the week will have to be revisited after this implosion. They remain second in Group D, but suddenly the home game against Borussia Dortmund (hopeless in the Bundesliga, different class in Europe) and the trip to Galatasaray have a menacing air about them.

From 3-0 up after 58 minutes at the Emirates there is an outside chance they will fail to qualify for the second stage for the first time in 15 years.

To the first half, then. Sanchez, this dreamy No 10 in Arsenal colours, ran the show for the home team.

As Arsenal blew their lead, fan Piers Morgan made this plea to City defender Vincent Kompany....

Morgan: If I pay you £50m will you play for us?

Kompany: Great club but no.

Morgan: £60m & 2 Ferraris?

Kompany: Those days have gone, I play for glory. :-)

The delay on the reverse pass into the penalty area for Danny Welbeck to run on to in that move that led to Arsenal’s opening goal was reminiscent of the late, great Billy Bremner. It was delicious.

Chancel Mbemba cut across Welbeck, getting all tangled up inside the area as he attempted to hold off the Arsenal striker and bundled him over. Penalty, no question.

Arteta scored easily and it seemed fitting that the captain of the team should be responsible for the 500th goal scored by Arsenal since their move to the Emirates in 2006.

They pressed the accelerator again. Sanchez scored their second in the 29th minute after he was knocked to the ground just outside the area by Vanden Borre.

He immediately took responsibility for the free-kick, reacting first when it cannoned off the wall to pick it out of the night sky and drive a low volley beyond the Anderlecht keeper.

That was 2-0 and Oxlade-Chamberlain added a third when he raced clear and beat Silvio Proto with a curving effort that hit the inside of the side netting.

‘Sanchez was one of the very few who was at his level,’ admitted Wenger. ‘He was involved in the three goals, he was one of the two or three at the level.’ At that stage it was game over. Or so we thought.

Anderlecht took a foothold in this match with a combination of canny second half substitutions by their coach. That, plus some outrageous good fortune.

Nacho Monreal was punished for pulling in the box, the offence that prompted Sportsmail’s campaign after grappling excesses in the Premier League. Monreal hauled down substitute Aleksandar Mitrovic and French referee Clement Turpin awarded the penalty to put life into Anderlecht.

When Vanden Borre scored the Belgians first when he met the cross from substitute Andy Kawaya, the stadium was gripped by fear. Nacho Monreal did nothing to lift the fog. 

This dopey Arsenal defender, an accident waiting to happen at the best of times, conceded a penalty when he body-checked Mitrovic.

Vanden Borre, who had a colourful game to say the least (and was booked before the final whistle), beat Szczesny with a neat penalty in the 73rd minute. It was then Hasi, who thrashed around inside the technical area for 90 minutes, believed.

Anderlecht inevitably made it 3-3 in the 90th minute when Mitrovic arrived inside the Arsenal’s penalty area to head in a dramatic equaliser.

If Wenger’s team makes it to the business end of this competition, they will get blown away.
