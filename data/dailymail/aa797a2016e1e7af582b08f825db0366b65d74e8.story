Unsettling revelations about the Illinois woman implicated in a plot to storm a Canada mall started to emerge as she and one of her alleged cohorts arrived for a brief appearance in a Halifax court today.

Tutors who taught the goth student, who allegedly planned a St Valentine's Day massacre, said she was a disturbed but talented writer.

Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath, 23, from Geneva, Illinois was arrested alongside Randall Steven Shepherd, 20, from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and charged with conspiracy to commit murder.

Nabbed: Souvannarath confessed to the plot when she was arrested at the Halifax airport early Friday, an official said, adding that she had prepared a number of pronouncements to be tweeted after her death. Shepard was also arrested at the airport, where he went to meet his friend, police said

Neither suspect appeared to acknowledge the other at a courthouse hearing Tuesday. Two sheriff's deputies sat between them.

Their cases were adjourned until March 6, and their court-appointed lawyer, Kishan Persaud, said they won't seek bail.

Souvannarath and Shepherd were planning a mass murder in Canada shortly before their arrest. 

College Professor Charles Aukema said: 'She knew how to put together a sentence and she had a command of detail. Sometimes, it was pretty sick detail.'

According to the Chicago Tribune, Prof Aukema had Souvannarath as a student in 2012. 

Commenting on her writing style, Prof Aukema said: 'It's like a method actor trying to get into the mindset of a killer and then becomes a serial killer. I thought she was quite an introvert. It just seemed like she had no friends whatsoever.'

Souvannarath admitted the massacre plot after her arrest at Halifax airport. 

A third suspect is believed to have shot himself after police surrounded his home in the Halifax suburb of Timberlea.

Souvannarath had posted a chilling warning on her Tumblr account predicting the massacre 

Souvannarath's writing is understood to be very disturbing and features stories about serial killers 

It is understood that Souvannarath, Shepherd, and the third man, James Gamble had discussed their plans on the internet. 

Canadian media said that Gamble, 19, took his own life. 

Justice Minister Peter MacKay said: 'Based on what we know so far, it would have been devestating. Mass casualties would have been a real possibility.

'This appeared to be a group of murderous misfits that were coming here, or living here, and were planning to wreak havoc and mayhem in our community.'

Souvanarath and Shepherd were arrested after they met in the airport. 

Brian Brennan of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said three long-barrelled rifles had been recovered from Gamble's house. 

Souvannarath posted about her admiration of Hitler, the Columbine killers and other murderers on her Facebook page, Tumblr site and forums, and even hinted at the deadly plan, writing last Wednesday: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down.'

Two days after the post, she was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder after police received a tip. Randall Shepherd, 20, of Nova Scotia was arrested on the same charges.

A third suspect, James Gamble, 19 killed himself as police moved to arrest him at his home in Nova Scotia, and a fourth - a 17-year-old boy - has been released from custody.

Online profiles show the named suspects had been exchanging unnerving messages for years.

The dark messages come in stark contrast to Souvannarath's high school yearbook photo shared by the Kane County Chronicle, which shows a pretty teen. She went on to study at Coe College, where she studied English and creative writing before graduating last year.

Souvannarath uploaded this disturbing 'White Power' image to her Facebook account in 2013 

But online, Souvannarath, whose father is from Laos, painted herself as a neo-Nazi and regularly shared photos of Hitler while lauding white separatists, such as former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

'Free speech is dead,' she apparently wrote in one forum in 2007, when she would have been just 15. 'That's why we need people like David Duke to bring it to life again.'

Her Tumblr account is entitled 'c**kswastika', according to the Chronicle Herald.

On the page, she displays a large pink swastika and links to James Gamble's Tumblr page, which shows images of Hitler, dead bodies and murders, and videos of the Columbine shooters.

Gamble's page also features conversations that include graphic sexual descriptions as well as naked images of himself.

'I'm such a morbid f***ing freak,' he writes in one post. 'I love it.'

Her Tumblr page also features images of the Columbine shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, including photos of their dead bodies,

'Eric and Dylan are dead, but Reb and VoDKa live,' she wrote, apparently referring to Gamble.

In one post from February 11, she shared a movie poster showing two ghoulish figures with the words: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down' - perhaps hinting at their alleged plan for February 14.

Beneath the poster she added: 'It's almost here. The clock is ticking.'

She also shared quotes from murderers and photos of weapons. One picture shows a man holding a gun and wearing a t-shirt that reads: 'Natural selection.'

Another post on her blog reads 'Saturday the 14th' in red, dripping letters with the comment: 'Ha Haa' written beneath.

Her website is still showing new updates. Police said that she had pre-programmed online messages before she was due to carry out the attacks and ultimately kill herself.

Shepherd has his own Tumblr page with the name genesistogenocide, according to the Chronicle Herald. The page is an ode to 'gore, porn, Columbine, horror and heavy f***ing metal'.

Again it features images of mass murderers, the Nazis and pornography.

As well as posting to Tumblr, Souvannarath and Shepheard appear to have been active on the online chat board Random Insanity, according to the Chronicle Herald. She appears to go by the name SnoopyFemme.

They are also connected with each other and Gamble on Facebook, where Souvannarath again shares violent images and her own Nazi-themed sketches.

The group, labeled by police as 'murderous misfits', had conspired to carry out a mall massacre on Valentine's Day and then take their own lives, authorities said.

Investigators say the group planned to open fire inside Halifax Shopping Centre on Saturday.

The plot was foiled by law enforcement at the last minute after they received a tip-off from a member of the public, according to a Halifax Police statement.

'Based on what we know so far, it would have been devastating - mass casualties would have been a real possibility,' Justice Minister Peter MacKay told reporters on Saturday.

'The attack does not appear to have been culturally motivated, therefore not linked to terrorism.

'A day known to represent love and affection could have taken a much different meaning today had it not been for the exceptional efforts of the combined law enforcement community.'

Souvannarath was arrested arriving at Halifax Stanfield International Airport by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police airport at 2am Friday. where she was being picked up by Shepherd. 

Gamble was found dead inside his parents' home in Timberlea at 1.20am on Friday, after officers surrounded the property. Police heard a single gunshot before entering the house.

Gamble's father told local media he needed privacy to grieve the death of his son, according to Global News
