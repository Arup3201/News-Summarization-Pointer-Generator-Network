The assassination of John F Kennedy is to be recreated in an historic three-hour primetime programme on Radio 2 - fronted by X Factor host Dermot O'Leary.

In a departure from his usual light entertainment role, O'Leary has been chosen alongside current affairs presenter Jeremy Vine to host the three-hour broadcast on November 22, the 50th anniversary of the US president's death.

It will feature live singers and a band performing poignant songs from the United States civil rights era, with the story being told minute-by-minute, starting with the departure of the Presidential motorcade from Dallas Love Field airport shortly before midday local time.  

It will finish with vice-president Lyndon B Johnson being sworn in as President on Air Force One three hours later.

O’Leary - who is reported to have a passion for history - said the story had an additional 
personal resonance for him because his parents in Co Wexford had met 
President Kennedy on a journey to trace his Irish family roots.

'They 
shook his hand,' he said. 'I spoke to my dad about the assassination and
he said it was a proper standstill moment. The moon landings and JFK 
getting shot were the two big moments for that generation.'

Largely known as an entertainment 
presenter, O’Leary described his role as 'wingman' to the 'gravitas' of Vine, a news and current affairs specialist.

The
X Factor presenter is a passionate fan of history and said he would 
like to make further documentaries as part of the BBC's commemoration of
the centenary of the First World War.

The
presenter has also talked to the BBC about a potential project tracing 
the front line of the Battle of the Somme, which stretched from the 
North Sea to Switzerland.

Bob
Shennan, controller of Radio 2, said the BBC would broadcast the events
at the time of day they happened – the shooting in Dealey Plaza 
occurred at 6.30pm British time. 'The listeners are very familiar with 
the tale but they be will be able to experience how that story unfolded 
in real time exactly 50 years on and that will give it a sense of 
frisson,' he told The Independent.

The
ambitious project follows the BBC’s real-time broadcast of the sinking 
of the Titanic on the centenary of the catastrophe in April last year.

That story, also featuring the narration of Vine and O’Leary, used live 
performance of the music of the ship’s orchestra as a soundtrack. The 
documentary won the Grand Award at the New York Festival for the world’s
best radio programmes.

The programme will air on November 22 - the day of President Kennedy's death 50 years before.

The Titanic broadcast was late at night 
but The Assassination Of JFK – Minute By Minute is being put into the 
drive-time schedule, meaning it is likely to be heard by an audience of 
around 7 million.

Shennan 
acknowledged the assassination was one of the first global news events 
to be communicated by television imagery. But he said: 'Sometimes these 
stories are better on radio because you are just concentrating on the 
spoken word and it can be made into a very powerful experience.'

The documentary is being made by independent production company TBI Media, which also produced the Titanic programme.

The live singers will be familiar names to the Radio 2 audience and the station said they were being carefully chosen for their ability to perform songs such as the civil rights anthem Abraham, Martin and John, written by Dick Holler five years after the shooting, and also referencing the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King
