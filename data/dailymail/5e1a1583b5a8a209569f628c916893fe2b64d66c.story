A pair of mysterious fast-moving discs of light have been pictured in the skies over the Berkshire town of Bracknell.

Steve Lambert, 42, was making a phone call outside the town's Running Horse Pub when he spotted the UFOs at 8pm on Friday.

The driving instructor from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said: 'I was drinking with my girlfriend and her son.'

The truth is out there: These two discs of light were spotted flying at speed above the Berkshire town of Bracknell by a shocked pubgoer

He added: 'I went outside to make a phone call when something caught my attention.

'It was around 8pm at night so there was a little bit of sun but it was mainly overcast.

'It was heading south west and quicker than any normal aircraft.

'I only saw it for less than five seconds.

'I have seen a lot of funny things in the sky and I have always practised trying to take a photo quickly on my mobile phone.

'I am interested to see if anyone else saw it and whether there were any other witnesses.

'I really want to know what is going on out there - there probably is life out there.'

Mr Lambert posted the photo to 
Facebook to get his friends' perspective on the mystery and and now 
wants to hear from anyone else who saw the UFOs.

I want to believe: Mr Lambert has asked other people in Bracknell who may have seen the UFOs to get in touch with him

A former Ministry of Defence (MoD) UFO expert says the photo is 'one of the best' he has seen.

Nick Pope, who investigated reports of UFO sightings from 1991 to 1994, said: 'The shape and colour seems to rule out things like aircraft lights or Chinese lanterns.

'It would be interesting to know if anyone else saw this, or if anything unusual was tracked on radar.'

This is the second UFO sighting over Bracknell this year after a mystery object was spotted just two miles from where this photo was taken.

In February a man, who wished to remain anonymous, said it he saw an object which was orange, bright red and yellow, which 'streaked across the sky for all of three seconds'.

Earlier this month three passenger 
jets sighted UFOs above Britain's Scientology headquarters on their 
approach to Gatwick Airport, according to a recently-revealed report.

Their pilots each saw 'two flat, silver discs', with some flying within 100ft.

Air traffic control then spotted six UFOs on their radars before they suddenly disappeared.

Investigators
 offered the possibility the objects could have been balloons or kites 
but, with the UFOs remaining untraced, the incidents were deemed not 
possible to assess.
