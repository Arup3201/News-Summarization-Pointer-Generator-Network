Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish thinks convicted rapist Ched Evans needs to 'go away, get his appeal done, and then come back into football' if he is to resume his professional career. 

Evans maintains his innocence and his case will be examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which will advise on whether it sees grounds to launch an appeal.

Parish feels the former Sheffield United striker's lack of remorse has made it difficult, and that Evans is going about returning to football all wrong.

'Ched has made it very difficult for people,' Parish told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek. 

'If you're convicted of a crime, and you're on licence for that crime, he is effectively on probation. 

'To have no remorse, to say "I just didn't do it", and expect everybody to employ you in the public domain in a very public sport, I think he has been badly advised.

'He really needs to go away, get his appeal done, and then come back into football and show the experience has changed him somehow.'

Evans was close to signing a contract with League One club Oldham Athletic but the deal fell through after a storm of opposition.

Oldham director Barry Owen insisted he has no regrets over the club's aborted attempt to sign the convicted rapist, and that it was only called off due to money issues.

'I will never regret it,' he told the BBC's Football League Show. 'I am hugely disappointed for many reasons that I can't discuss.

'Oldham were going to get a footballer that in other circumstances they wouldn't have been able to afford. This was driven by football reasons.

'We knew there would be a storm to bear and were prepared to accept a lot of that and take it on the chin because we believed strongly in the right to employ this man.

'We did not anticipate the amount of sponsorship pressure, which was understandable because they were under extreme pressure. In the end it came down purely to the finances.'

Evans was signed by Sheffield United for £3million back in 2009 and impressed at Bramall Lane
