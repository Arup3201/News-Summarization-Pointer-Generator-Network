Rising prosperity among ethnic minority voters could help swing the election for David Cameron, a new report revealed yesterday.

Research by the Left-leaning Demos think-tank suggests the emergence of a significant black and Asian middle class could break Labour’s traditional stranglehold on the ethnic minority vote.

The report, co-written by former Labour politician and equalities tsar Trevor Phillips, suggests ‘upwardly mobile’ ethnic minority voters are more likely to vote Tory.

A report by think-tank Demos suggests 'upwardly mobile' ethnic minority voters are more likely to vote Tory in the 2015 election - breaking Labour's traditional stranglehold

It says Labour’s hold over ethnic minority voters fades as they prosper and move to the suburbs.

The authors say there is a huge electoral prize for the party that can get to grips with Britain’s shifting demographics.

The report states: ‘There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that any emerging volatility among the UK’s five million ethnic electors may turn out to be at least as significant as the three million who tell pollsters they might support Ukip in the forthcoming election.’

The study suggests that second- and third-generation immigrants are losing their ‘reflex’ support for Labour, particularly when they move to traditionally white middle-class areas.

‘The expectation would be that succeeding generations of minority voters may drift away from their parents’ reflex support for Labour – or at the very least might not inherit the first-generation immigrants’ hostility to the Conservatives,’ it says.

The Tory party secured only 16 per cent of the minority vote in the last election compared with 68 per cent for Labour

‘The other factor that could boost the Tory share of seats is a secular out-movement of ethnic minority families from the inner-city neighbourhoods in which they first settled.

‘The process is accelerating in London in particular due to the combination of spiralling inner-city housing costs and changes to the benefit system.’

A study of polling data shows that while 60 per cent of ethnic minority voters in non-white areas support Labour, the proportion falls to 48.1 per cent among those living in traditionally white neighbourhoods.

The effect is particularly marked among voters from an Indian background, with Labour support among this group falling from 39 per cent to 13 per cent when they move to white suburbs.

Mr Phillips suggests the effect is significant enough to swing the result in a string of marginal seats.

He suggests that the Tories are more likely to hang on to Labour target seats such as Hendon and Wolverhampton South West because of the impact of ‘upwardly mobile Indian heritage, Tory- voting electors’.

A study by the cross-party group Operation Black Vote last year found the number of seats where black and Asian voters could decide the outcome had rocketed by 70 per cent compared with the 2010 election.

It suggests that the ethnic minority vote is bigger than the majority of the sitting MP in 168 marginal seats.

The seats extend beyond inner-city areas to include Ipswich, Southampton and Oxford.

In the last election the Tories secured only 16 per cent of the minority vote, compared with 68 per cent for Labour.
