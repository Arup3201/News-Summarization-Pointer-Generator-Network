Wilfried Bony's move to Manchester City is set to be completed after Swansea accepted an offer worth close to £30million.

Sportsmail understands the initial fee is £25m up front, plus a further £3m if City win the Barclays Premier League, Champions League or FA Cup during Bony's contract.

Swansea had been locked in talks with the Barclays Premier League champions over the structuring of the transfer, with City having to satisfy Financial Fair Play criteria to enable a move for the prolific 26-year-old.

But after those issues were resolved, City will now wrap up their move for the striker, who will not be available for selection until he returns from the African Cup of Nations.

Bony is currently in Abu Dhabi – the home of City's owners - with the Ivory Coast national side ahead of the African Cup of Nations.

But it is understood personal terms have been agreed on a four-year contract worth in the region of £100,000 a week.

That is close to double what the striker, who has scored 34 goals in 70 games at Swansea, is earning at the Liberty Stadium.

He said on Saturday: 'I really want to win something in my career. That is what I'm working for.'

It remains to be seen if Bony's belated arrival will resurrect the title bid of a side that has been desperately lacking available strikers.

But Yaya Toure said: 'Manchester City are always a club that wants important players like Bony and Aguero, they always want to progress and be at the top of the Premier League. 

'If you want to be at the top of the Premier League you need to sign the top players and Bony is one of them at the moment.

'It will be tough to win the title again as Chelsea are in a good moment. 

'It is not finished and we need to compete well and do the business and again.'

Speaking last week, Bony said: 'Every player wants to play in the Champions League and World Cup - so it's the wish of every player.

'When you get the opportunity, sometimes it happens, sometimes not, but I am just taking things day by day.' 

Bony joined Swansea for an initial £12m in summer 2013 and extended his contract to 2018 last November. 

Crucially, the deal removed a £19m release clause that was included in the original. Liverpool had been interested but are understood to have been put off by his wage demands. 

It is also understood Swansea are considering a move for Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse.
