Former bandmates of paedophile Ian Watkins say they have severed all ties with the shamed singer after he was jailed for child sex abuse.

Two members of the band have spoken for the first time since Watkins, 36, was jailed for 35 years for a string of sex offences - including the attempted rape of a baby.

Guitarists Lee Gaze and Mike Lewis told of their sense of betrayal after first believing the band's former frontman was innocent following his initial arrest.

Guitar player Lee Gaze, 39, said he had initially feared for his one-time friend 
when he was held in prison and maintained his innocence.

Gaze described Watkins, who eventually admitted 13 offences, as a 'weak character', adding: 'He's a bit of a coward.

'To be in prison, where he's going to be the guy from the rock band with
 those charges, I was worried. But then I reached a point where real 
resentment set in.'

He said he has no interest in ever speaking to Watkins again, saying he doesn't think the jailed singer would explain himself anyway.

Watkins, whose group sold more than 3.5m records but have now split,
 told his bandmates he was set up after rumours emerged that he had been found in possession of 
indecent images of children, following his drugs arrest in a 2012.

Father-of-two
 Gaze, who was 17 when he met then-15-year-old Watkins, said the singer repeatedly told his bandmates he had been wrongly incriminated.

In an interview with The Sunday Times Magazine's Krissi Murison, fellow guitarist Mike Lewis, who has known Watkins since the pair met aged five at infants school in Pontypridd, south Wales, said: 'I find it utterly unbelievable that he was capable of doing those things.'

He said his shock was made all the worse by the fact that he been friends with Watkins, known his family and grown up alongside him.

Lewis, 36, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife and four-year-old daughter, said he had severed all links with his former bandmate and once close friend.

He said he had also considered whether he would want to speak to Watkins in prison but had decided he would not, even if he was given the chance.

Lewis said he was away on holiday when Watkins was charged with a string of offences, including the abuse of children.

The band split last October ahead of Watkins' trial but his former bandmates now plan to form a new group.

Lewis said the band's 'legacy' had been 'wiped out' by Watkins' crimes and it is now impossible for the band to be proud of their achievements.

Watkins was sentenced at Cardiff 
Crown Court in December and told he would have to serve at least 35 years
 before being considered for release.

The court heard that after sexually touching a groupie's 11-month-old baby, Watkins tried to have penetrative sex with the child.

He also encouraged a second fan to abuse her child during a webcam chat and secretly stashed child porn videos, some of which he had made himself.

Sentencing judge Mr Justice Royce told Watkins: 'Those who have appeared in these courts over many years see a large number of horrific cases. This case, however, breaks new ground.

'I am satisfied that you are a deeply corrupting influence, you are highly manipulative, you are a sexual predator, you are dangerous.'

After pleading guilty to the charges, Watkins, 36, sent a message to a fan joking about the offences.

'I am going to put a statement out just to say it was mega lolz,' he said. 'I don't know what everyone is getting so freaked out about.'
