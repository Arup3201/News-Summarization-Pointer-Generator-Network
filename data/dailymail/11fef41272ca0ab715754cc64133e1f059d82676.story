Aaron Ramsey is eager to 'get better and better' and thinks he gave his critics a taste of what he is all about last season.

The Arsenal midfielder is off the back of his best season yet, having scored 16 goals last year despite being sidelined for three months with a thigh injury.

One of those goals was the extra-time winner in the FA Cup final over Hull City, which ended Arsene Wenger's nine-year wait for a trophy, and the 23-year-old was glad to prove the doubters wrong.

Training: Ramsey is off the back of his best season yet, having scored 16 goals, including the FA Cup winner

BORN: Wales, December 26 1990 (age 23)

2006-2008: Cardiff (16 apps, 1 gl)

2010-2011: Nottingham Forest (loan) (5, 0)

'I've
 been through a lot in my short career so far,' Ramsey told the club's 
official website.

'I've had a bit of everything so it was nice to have a
 good season, score the number of goals that I did and be recognised a 
lot more. 

'I've always believed in myself and what I can do, 
and I think a lot of people realised that last year and that's what I'm 
more happy about.'

Wenger and his team appeared in good spirits as they were put through their paces on Wednesday.

The French boss, having captured the Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona for £30million last week, took to Arsenal's training base at London Colney.

And Ramsey says it can set the wheels in motion for a good season.

'It's always important to get a good pre-season in you,' added Ramsey.

'I want to keep on working on my game.

'Hopefully
 I can keep improving and get better and better. That's my target now - 
just to improve on my game and keep on building every season.'
