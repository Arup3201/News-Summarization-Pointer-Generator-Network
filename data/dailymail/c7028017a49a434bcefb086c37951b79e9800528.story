Parts of Rolls-Royce engines powering passenger jets could soon be made by 3D printers.

The British firm says the technique could allow it to produce complicated components more quickly and cheaply.

3D printers, which are available in high street shops, make solid objects from digital models instead of reproducing text or images on paper.

The 3D printers, some which will fit on to a desktop, create three-dimensional objects rather than 2-dimensional images on a page.

Rolls-Royce head of technology strategy Dr Henner Wapenhans said: ‘One of the great advantages in the aerospace world is that some of these parts that we make have very long lead times, because of the tooling process.

‘And then it takes potentially 18 months to get the first part after placing an order - versus printing it, which could be done quite rapidly. Even if it takes a week to print, that’s still a lot faster.

‘3D printing opens up new possibilities. Through the 3D printing process, you’re not constrained by having to get a tool in to create a shape. You can create any shape you like.

‘There are studies that show one can create better lightweight structures, because you just take the analogy of what nature does and how bones are built up. And so things that are simple things like brackets can be made a lot lighter.’

Hi-tech to high street: 3D printers are now available in shops for around £1,600 and are moving into mass production

Dr Wapenhans said Rolls-Royce could also make cost savings because it would not need to spend money to store key parts but could ‘print’ them as required.

The technology is set to transform many areas of manufacturing. Sales of 3D printers soared last year to £1.5billion and is expected to hit £4billion by 2017, say City experts at analysts Wohlers.

Savings: Using printing technology to make parts could save substantial sums currently spent on lengthy construction and storage

Once seen as a hi-tech piece of specialist equipment, 3D printers have begun to move into mass production in recent months. High street electronics store Maplin is selling the first version on the high street for £1,600.

The technology dates back to the 1980s when 3D printers used plastics. But the latest versions of the technology is capable of building complex shapes from ceramics and metal.

They can be programmed to create a host of items, from sports shoes ton hip-replacement and hit the headlines recently amid claims they were being used to manufacture parts for guns.

Scientists are even experimenting with the technology with a view to using cells to create spare body parts and organs.

Pupils in UK schools are also to be taught to experiment with the technology under new Government plans to drive up standards in subjects such as maths and science.

London’s Science Museum is currently exhibiting 600 3D printed objects.

Rolls-Royce plc chief executive John Rishton has vowed to crack down on costs in a bid to keep up with arch-rivals in the aero-engine world such as US giant General Electric which also plans to use 3D printers, including to form fuel nozzles for jet engines.

German electronics giant Siemens and car-maker and aero-engine manufactuerer BMW are also developing 3D printing applications.

Suzy Antoniw, exhibition leader at London’s Science Museum said: ‘3D printing enables engineers and designers to manufacture things they couldn’t make with traditional methods.

‘Every day we learn about new ways in which people from across society are capitalising on the technology to realise their ideas and enrich people’s lives.’
