These two adorable baby wallabies born at the same zoo look like they were swapped at birth - but in a rare genetic phenomenon they gave birth to opposite coloured joeys.

Visitors to Tropical Wings Zoo in South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, often ask if the the two wallabies have their joeys the wrong way around.

But actually bemused visitors are witnessing a one in 100,000 occurrence where non-albino wallaby Monica, gave birth to an albino joey. Meanwhile Emily, an albino wallaby, gave birth to a brown joey.

The chances of a non-albino wallaby like Monica giving birth to an albino joey are one in 100,000

Zoo keeper, John Ray, said: ‘It is extremely rare to see two parents like this in captivity and as far as I am aware it has never been recorded in the wild.

‘The Joeys are the size of a bean when they are first born and the gestation period is only thirty days.

‘When you start to see their heads out of the pouch they are between three to four months old and they stay in the pouch for nine months.

The two joeys have not yet been named and the Tropical Wings Zoo intends to hold a competition to name them

‘We were amazed when we first saw them pop their heads out. They have gone down a storm with visitors over the Easter holidays.’

The youngsters are believed to be around four months old and are expected to stay in their parents' pouches for another five months before going it alone.

Melanie Brett, a mother of two from Chelmsford, Essex, took her two young boys to see the amazing sight.

The 38-year-old said: ‘When I saw the wallabies - I did a double-take as it looked so unusual with them looking like they are the wrong way round.

‘I think my boys were even more confused than me about what was happening. We even asked the keeper if the joeys and mums had got confused and done a swap.

‘It's lovely to see them all looking so happy though, whatever colour they may be.’

Tropical Wings are set to launch a competition in the coming weeks to name the two baby joeys.
