A man going to the aid of a drowning woman in southern France watched in horror as his wife and daughter were then swept away in their caravan as flooding across central Europe last night claimed another five lives.

The latest area to be devastated by the worst flooding the area has experienced in decades, was Lamalou-les-Bains, where a quiet river swelled into a raging torrent and ripped through a camping ground and across the village, collecting and destroying everything in its path.

The towns mayor, Philippe Thailland, has described the heartbreaking scene, involving a man in his 60s, clinging on to a drowning woman, only to witness his own family being swept swept.

The man was
 unable to save the woman, and later his wife was found dead in her 
caravan, which was found stuck under a bridge. His 34-year-old daughter remains missing.

More than 80 deaths had been confirmed before the latest casualties added to the tally. At least 58 died in the Black Sea area over the weekend, where thousands 
of Russian tourists were caught out by flood waters that swept cars and 
tents out to sea.

Thousands of British tourists are being forced 
to cancel holidays amid the chaos. One of the worst-hit cities is 
Prague, where more than 50,000 people, including foreign visitors, were 
evacuated as the floods threaten to engulf the Czech capital.

The camping
 ground in Lamalou-les-Bains was hit by floods that had 
already claimed the life of an elderly woman in Aveyron, and left 
another person unaccounted for.

At
 the camping ground, a man and woman were found dead in separate 
caravans.

Rescuers said a third person was swept away by a wave more 
than seven feet high and that two other bodies had been found, but they 
were yet to determine if they were those of two people still reported 
missing.

Lamalou-les-Bains today remained a muddy mess. Fallen trees covered roads and upturned vehicles were scattered about, as firemen and local residents began pumping water out of properties and doing their best to clean up while the weather remained steady.

The area remains under risk, forecasters have said. Storms are expected later today and will continue into the weekend.

Villager who refuses to evacuate home captures raging waters tearing through his Serbian village

Meanwhile, in Serbia a video has emerged showing just how devastating raging water can be.

The torrent of water raged through Tekija, in eastern Serbia, absorbing and destroying everything in its path.Trees, the wooden frames of houses and cars became part of the wall of water.

Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes because of the flood danger, but at least person is known to have died as a result. The footage was captured by one villager who refused to leave his home.

The flooding started in the Balkans last week with heavy rain falls in neighbouring Croatia, before it spread to Serbia where rain swollen rivers also swept away bridges and roads and cut off power supplies and telephones lines.

A total of 15 villages are in danger in the Kladovo region, near the border with Romania, where main roads connecting the area with the rest of Serbia have been either flooded or destroyed.

The region has only recently recovered from heavy flooding in May of this year that also claimed several lives.
