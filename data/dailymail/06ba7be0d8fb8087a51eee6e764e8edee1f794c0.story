It's Christmas party time, and that means one thing: Big hair. But getting a festive look needn't mean hours under the dryer.

Here, in in the first of our three-part hair video tutorials, celebrity hairdresser Mark Woolley shows us a classic Christmas party look that you can do yourself with ease: the updated Hollywood Wave.

Abbey Clancy showed this style off to perfection at a Strictly photocall earlier this year, and Mark thinks the failsafe style will be perfect for the festive season.

But in his version, the curls are more defined and the top section is brushed out to highlight contrasting textures. Fine hair is injected with extra volume thanks to the addition of hair wefts.

MARK SAYS:

'Brush the hair through and colour match the extensions.

'For this look we used plenty to achieve volume in naturally fine hair.

'Three pieces included two from Beauty Works Deluxe Clip Ins, 18" long, colour 613/24 (LA Blonde), plus a Clip-in Quadruple Weft, 18" long, colour 613/27 (Boho Blonde).

'Curl the extensions with a medium-thick barrelled tong, pin and leave to the side. We used 32mm Diva Argan Tongs.'

MARK SAYS:

'Section the hair and curl with the same tong to achieve the same curl in the natural hair and in the hair extensions.

'Clip them into place as you go so they have a chance to cool and set in place - and they'll last longer, too.'

MARK SAYS:

'Now you're ready to clip in your party night hair pieces.

'We sectioned the hair into three sections to add three pieces. If you have thicker hair naturally you could only use two.

'Backcomb a small section of the hair by the parting for long-lasting hold.

'If you are using three, place the smallest one near the nape of the neck and work your way up towards the middle of the head.'

MARK SAYS:

'Once you've clipped the extensions in and trimmed them to desired length if need be, pile all the remaining hair over the top, tilt your head back, ruffle to define the curls and spray.

'Brush out the top section to emphasise the curls towards the bottom with contrasting texture.
