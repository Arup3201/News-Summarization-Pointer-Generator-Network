A study has found that one in ten older mothers have premature babies

One in ten mothers aged 40 and over gives birth to a premature baby, according to official figures.

Older mothers are 50 per cent more likely to give birth too soon compared with  younger women.

Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that 10.1 per cent of babies born to mothers aged 40 or over were delivered before 37 weeks in England and Wales in 2011.

This is up slightly on the 9.5 per cent figure for 2007 and compares with 6.7 per cent for mothers aged 25 to 29.

The number of live births to mothers aged 40 and over has more than quadrupled over the past three decades – from 6,519 in 1982 to 29,994 in 2012. A normal pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, with a delivery before 37 weeks considered premature.

Analysis by the ONS showed that part of the reason for the higher percentage of older mothers giving birth prematurely may be because they are more likely to have twins or triplets.

In 2011, 6.2 per cent of babies born to mothers aged 40 or over were multiple births, compared with just 1.2 per cent of babies born to mothers in their teens.

Only 5.6 per cent of single births are premature, compared with more than half of babies in multiple pregnancies.

There are now more than 60,000 premature births in Britain every year – a record level driven by multiple births caused by IVF treatment and planned Caesarean deliveries.

Older mothers are 50 per cent more likely to give birth too soon compared with younger women, a study has revealed

It places a large burden on the NHS, with advances in medical science driving up survival rates among premature babies.

But they are still more at risk of dying  and in need of intensive care, while those infants who survive are at greater risk of being disabled.

Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, said: ‘These figures support our calls for enough midwives to provide care to the increasing number of older mothers who need more time, attention and monitoring throughout their pregnancy.

‘It demonstrates that births are becoming increasingly complex as more older women give birth, along with other issues such as obesity.

‘This also demonstrates the need for continuity of care for women, which will reap benefits for older women who tend to have more complicated pregnancies.‘These women also need extra care after birth as they have a small baby or babies.’
