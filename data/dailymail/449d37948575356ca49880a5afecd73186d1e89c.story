Tim Cahill has lavished praise on David Moyes and has revealed his former manager is 'chomping at the bit' to return to management following his Old Trafford dismissal.

Moyes caught up with Cahill in New York last week after taking time out to visit his former Everton talisman during a trip to the States and the Australian has since commented on the 51-year's desire to bounce back from his nightmare spell at Manchester United.

Cahill, who worked under Moyes for eight years during his time at Goodison Park, said: 'I think he's enjoying himself by having some time off.

'But I think for him he's going to hear some noises soon because he's definitely a man in demand.

'After that transition where he had 10 months at Manchester United I think it is time for him just to chill out but he is definitely champing at the bit.'

New York Red Bulls ace Cahill also stated his admiration for a manager who gave him the chance to express himself at the highest level of English football.

'He's a man I admire a lot as a manager and obviously as a person,' added Cahill.

'Moyes is fantastic. He's a fantastic man who has done a lot for my career on and off the park.'

Everton finished fourth in Cahill's debut season following his £1.5million move from Millwall in 2004
