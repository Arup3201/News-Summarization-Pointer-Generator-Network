A lesbian whose religious parents refused to come to her wedding has instead received support from tens of thousands of internet users after posting beautiful photographs of the day online.

Meredeith Hendrix, a 25-year-old grad student, married girlfriend Kat Jackson, also 25, in Arkansas in October, witnessed by friends and family - although her parents had refused the invitation.

After the wedding, which she called the 'best day of my life', Hendrix-Jackson shared some of her gorgeous wedding photographs on Tumblr - and received an overwhelming response.

Stunning: Hendrix-Jackson said that out of all of the messages she had received online, none were negative

She wrote beneath the images: 'In case you are a fan of same sex 
unions, weddings in general, or are just really itching to know what I 
look like (or my wife, as I haven’t posted a picture of her yet [she’s 
the adorable one in the suspenders]).'

The photographs, taken by photographer Megan Burges, fast became an internet hit, amassing more than 10,000 'notes' - including likes, shares and comments - on Tumblr.

They show the happy couple getting ready for the day - Hendrix in a beautiful white lace gown, Jackson in pants, a shirt, bow-tie and suspenders - before walking down the aisle.

At the end of the aisle, they remove scarves covering their eyes and gasp as they see each other for the first time.

Big day: Ahead of the wedding and posting the images online, Hendrix said the couple had received negative reactions to their relationship; Jackson was once even fired after her boss saw them kissing

Two weeks later, Hendrix posted again 
to thank people for their overwhelming support, and said she had been 
stunned how they had not received a single homophobic or negative 
message.

'[N]ot a single message I've received,
 not a single reblog that I have been able to find, has had anything to 
say but amazing, beautiful, kind words of congratulations,' she wrote.

'No bullying. 
No trolling. No inappropriate offers or lewd remarks. Out of tens of 
thousands... That's not something I’m used to. It's not something anyone in the LGBTQ community is used to.'

She
 added that her wife had even previously been fired from a job as a 
driver for a children’s occupational therapist after her boss saw the 
couple kissing at the mall.

Hendrix also spoke about how much she was loving married life.

'I've
 been married for about two months, and goddammit, it has been just the 
best, you know?' she said. 'She's incredible. She's unreal. She's kind 
and she’s thoughtful and she's everything I never thought I deserved. 
She's the woman who I get to spend the rest of my ridiculously lucky 
life with.

'It's so simple to me, to us... But it's so complicated to so much of the world.'

In an email to the Daily Dot,
 Hendrix-Jackson said her sister and extended family had traveled to the
 wedding, but that her 'stoically religious' parents had refused her 
invitation.

She added that she had met her wife at college as they both studied theater.

Together: Hendrix thanked Tumblr users for their support after she posted the pictures and said that not everyone had been quite so accepting - including her parents, who had refused the wedding invite

She expressed her thanks for the 
overwhelming support in a post on Tumblr, writing: 'Do you even get how 
amazing you are? You, the denizens of Tumblr. Do you understand that?

'I
 am so exceedingly proud of you, you wacky kids. You are all such 
incredible people, with such kind and open hearts, and I wish I could 
hug each and every one of your necks.

'So
 if you are having any sort of rough day, please know that there is this
 tiny lesbian couple in northeast America who likes you just a whole 
lot, okay? You've overwhelmed us. Thank you. We love you.'

And in one final thank you - she uploaded even more photographs of their happy day.
