A woman is accused of killing four people, including her 19-year-old niece who was cradling her baby as well as two other family members and one unrelated victim.

Cherie Louise Rhoades had been evicted from tribal housing because she was suspected of stealing from the tribe, the tribe's lawyer said Monday.

Cedarville Rancheria attorney Jack Duran said Rhoades was suspended as tribal chairwoman just three weeks before the gun and knife attack, pending a federal investigation into allegations that she embezzled at least $50,000 in federal grant money.

Rhoades' son, Jack Stockton, was ousted 
as vice chairman and evicted from tribal housing on the same grounds, 
Duran told The Associated Press.

Stockton was not at Thursday's hearing when the shooting broke out. He does not have a listed phone number.

Duran said the meeting in Alturas, California, was being held to consider Rhoades' appeal of her eviction.

But at some point, Rhoades opened fire, killing her brother Rurik Davis, 50, who had been named interim chairman by the tribal council, authorities said.

Also killed in the attack were Rhoades' niece Angel Penn, 19; her nephew Glenn Calonicco, 30; and Shelia Lynn Russo, 47. They were all members of the tribal council that evicted Rhoades, and Russo was the tribal administrator.

Duran said Penn was holding her newborn infant on her lap when she was shot, but the baby was unhurt and will be placed with a sister.

Davis' two daughters, Monica and Melissa Davis, were critically wounded, court documents said.

Responding officers arrested Rhoades outside the building, where a declaration of probable cause says Modoc County Undersheriff Ken Richardson saw Rhodes stabbing one of the victims in the parking lot and handcuffed her after another person tackled her.

The document adds that police talked to six people who witnessed the shooting. The two women who survived bullet wounds were also cut with a knife.

A criminal complaint filed Monday in Modoc County Superior Court charges Rhoades with four counts of murder with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, and two counts of attempted murder. She was to be arraigned Tuesday morning.

District Attorney Jordan Funk said she will face the death penalty if she's convicted, because the complaint carries the special circumstance of multiple victims.

Funk said it wasn't immediately clear 
if attorneys had been appointed for Rhoades yet, because they would have
 to be qualified to handle a capital case.

The
 Cedarville Rancheria is a federally recognized tribe with 35 registered
 members. The Rancheria owns 26 acres in Cedarville, where most members 
reside in nine small, one-story houses built in the 1950s on the 
outskirts of town.

In 
2012, the tribe received an Indian housing grant for $50,399 from the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to a news 
release on the agency's website.

Duran said he couldn't confirm whether that was the money in question, adding the amount could be less 'or a lot more.'

Though
 police have said they are still working on a motive, a nephew who lived
 with Rhoades, Jacob Penn, said she snapped under the pressure of her 
brother's attempt to evict her.

Eviction
 from tribal housing is among the most serious punishments for American 
Indians. However, Rhoades and Stockton were not being removed from 
tribal rolls and would continue to receive their share of $1.1 million 
in gambling revenue shared by casino tribes with the Rancheria, which 
does not have a casino, Duran said.

Alturas
 Police Chief Ken Barnes said that as the shooting erupted, young 
children were inside the building and on the property, and a judge from 
another tribe was listening to the eviction proceedings over the phone.

After
 running out of bullets, Rhoades grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed a 
woman, police said. She chased one of Davis' daughters out of the 
building and into the parking lot while brandishing the knife.

There, she was tackled by the tribal headquarters maintenance man, Duran said.

Both
 of Davis' daughters were wounded. Officials said one was alert and 
talking, while the other remained in critical condition Friday.

The
 tribe's headquarters - a ranch-style building with a pitched brown 
metal roof and solar panels - is in a residential area about a block 
from the police station. Police were alerted to the attack by a woman 
covered in blood pounding on a side entrance to City Hall, which also 
houses the police.

The 
tribe is busy cleaning the building, and it is uncertain whether it will
 resume using the facility because of the slayings, Duran said.

'She
 bullied her way through life,' said Sandra Parriott, a lifelong 
resident of Cedarville and owner of two downtown markets, of Rhoades. 
'But I would never think she would start blowing people away in a 
meeting.'

Eviction from 
tribal housing is among the most serious punishments for American 
Indians. Though police have said they are still working on a motive, a 
nephew who lived with her, Jacob Penn, said she snapped under the 
pressure of her brother trying to evict her. The brother, Rurik Davis, 
who lived down the street on the Rancheria, had apparently taken over as
 tribal chairman and was among the dead.

Investigators
 had been looking into whether Rhoades took federal grant money meant 
for the rancheria she once led, a person familiar with the tribe's 
situation told The Associated Press. The person spoke only on condition 
of anonymity.

Alturas Police
 Chief Ken Barnes said they were looking into whether the embezzlement 
allegations spurred the tribe's efforts to evict Rhoades but they had 
not established any definitive motive.

The
 investigation was no secret around town, where several people 
interviewed by the AP mentioned it, though they said they had not been 
contacted by investigators and did not want to give their names.

Though
 Rhoades was always ready to share a joke, 'you did not want to get on 
her bad side,' said Penny Nash, Parriott's sister. 'She has a powerful 
personality.'

It was not immediately known if 
Rhoades had a lawyer. She was being held at an undisclosed location 
because the husband of one of the dead, the only non-relative to be shot,
 works at the Modoc County Jail, Sheriff Mike Poindexter said.

Rhoades
 has yet to appear in court, where she would be given a lawyer if she 
could not afford one herself. Her father, Larry Lash, declined to 
comment. Penn, who lived with Rhoades and was raised by her after her 
sister gave him up as a child, had little to say but a shrug of the 
shoulders about his aunt, whom he called, 'my mom.' He said two of the 
dead were his brother and sister, Rhoades' nephew and niece.

Most
 of the 35 registered members of the rancheria appear to have been 
related to Rhodes. Parriott ticked off 20 people on her fingers she knew
 were relatives of Rhoades.

Parriott
 said her late mother had known Rhoades' late mother, Virginia Sweeney, 
who lived in town as a child, but not on the rancheria. Rhoades came 
back about 20 years ago with her young son, mother and brother, Davis, 
and worked her way into leadership of the tribe.

Parriott said Rhoades 'was always loud. She kept pushing and plowing to get her way.'

'I
 sure wouldn't have wanted to be her neighbor,' Parriott added. 'She 
took pretty good care of her kid, but I don't know that she had any 
friends. She had family, but family aren't always your friends.'

Rhoades' brother, Rurik Davis, was easy to get along with, Parriott said.

The
 U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs sent a team to Alturas on Saturday to 
provide grief counseling for anyone wanting it, agency spokeswoman 
Nedra Darling said in an email.

Cedarville
 is a small town of about 1,500 people in the Great Basin, where the 
Paiute people once roamed with the skills to live in hard country. Now 
there are cattle on the range. The town is tucked between the foothills 
of the snowcapped Warner Mountains to the west, and a string of alkali 
lakes to the east.

The best 
jobs are working for the Modoc National Forest, the U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management or the schools. A lumber mill lies rusting and quiet on the 
edge of town. Downtown has several empty storefronts, but there are nice
 cafes where one can get prime rib, pizza or an enchilada, a bank, a 
bookstore, two small markets, a real estate office, a weaver's shop, a 
gas station, the library, a gunsmith, and other small businesses.

In
 the residential areas, nicely kept two-story homes mix with vacant 
houses. There is also a small hospital and dentist offices.

The
 rancheria is on the western edge of town, by the fairgrounds, announced
 by a simple wooden sign. Nine small one-story homes are grouped around a
 small playground. Streets are paved, with new concrete sidewalks.

A
 few blocks away is the Rabbit Traxx gas station and convenience store, 
where Rhoades worked. It opened a couple years ago, about the time she 
was tribal chairman. It sells liquor, cut-rate cigarettes and packaged 
foods.

Rancheria
 headquarters, where the shooting took place, is 25 miles away on a 
winding two-lane blacktop over the Warner Mountains in a residential 
area of Alturas, a town of 2,500.
