A pretty schoolgirl has been left scarred for life after her face was savaged by a 'dangerous' rottweiler as she sat on a garden bench.

Courtney Nurden, 11, needed 30 stitches to wounds on her cheek when she was bitten and clawed by the vicious animals in Newport, South Wales.

The schoolgirl's mother told how the animal came up to Courtney and 'launched at her face' in the attack last week.

Terrified Courtney needed stitches after being left with puncture wounds to her left cheek.

Her mother Claire, 37, said: 'The dog came up to her and suddenly launched at her face.

'She fell to the ground and started screaming which brought neighbours running.

'They wrestled the dog away from Courtney and she ran home.

'I had a terrible shock when I saw her - I called an ambulance straight away.'

Courtney’s wounds needed internal and external stitches and she has lost feeling in the left side of her face.

She was sent home but an infection developed and Courtney was re-admitted to hospital.

Claire said: 'Courtney underwent surgery to open the wound and clean it out.

'She’s such a pretty little girl - I’m worried that she will be left with unsightly scars.'

The schoolgirl, from Newport, South Wales, will have to wait for the wounds to heal before she can be seen by a cosmetic surgery specialists.

Police were yesterday investigating the attack but the dog has not been put down because it happened on private land.

Claire said: 'It’s a dangerous dog and should be destroyed before it bites another child.

'If a person harms another person they go to prison for it whether it happens on private land or not.'

Police have since said, however, that no further action will be taken as the girls had entered a secure area where the dog was kept.

A Gwent police spokeswoman said: 'We received a report at 4.55pm on June 18 that a young girl had been injured. On arriving we found the two children had entered a secure area where the dog was kept.

'All responsible steps had been taken by the owners to secure the dog and to make people aware of the dog’s presence.'
