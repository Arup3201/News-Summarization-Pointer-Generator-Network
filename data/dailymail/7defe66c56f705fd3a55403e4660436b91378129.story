If you get into the festive spirit the moment you hear a Christmas song or see rows of tinsel for sale, you’re best advised to keep clear of these roads.

Streets such as Tinsel Lane, Noel Road, Frosty Hollow and Advent Way may look out of place in the summer months - but they come into their own in December.

Research by Royal Mail staff has found that the UK has 3,369 Christmas-themed street names, based on analysis of every street name in the nation.

Festively-named Tinsel Lane in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, was this year decorated by residents Michelle Orton and her three-year-old son, Matthew

Holly Street is the most common festive street name in the UK. There are 990 street names of this kind around the UK.

1. Holly Street

2. Bell Lane

3. Mary Street

4. Angel Lane

5. Star Road

6. Bow Street

7. Festival Place

8. Noel Road

9. Gold Street

10. Garland Street

The research also found that the Midlands has a total of 560 Christmas street names, more than any other region in the UK.

The region has a grand total of 560 Christmas themed street names and enjoys festive street names such as Reindeer Road, Noel Street, Bell Close and the ubiquitous Holly Street.

The ratings came from analysis of Royal Mail’s database of all 29 million UK addresses.

The database also reveals our love for Santa’s Reindeers, with seven of the nine reindeers represented on a street name.

These include: Dasher, Dancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Rudolph.

Residents of Tinsel Lane in Nuneaton have this year made a particularly big effort by dressing their sign up like a Christmas tree.

Three-year-old Matthew and his mother, Michelle Orton, have already been to decorate the street sign in tinsel.

Meanwhile, Frosty Hollow in Northampton will attract many festive photographs during this month.

And sisters Niamh Davey, eight, and Ciara, five, appear to have beaten their friends to it, dressed in their Christmas hats.

Noel Road, in Ealing, West London, takes a little more imagination but can still be considered a very Christmassy-sounding street, if pronounced in the right way

Reindeer Close is a little more blatant, and is bound to get East London residents in the Christmas spirit come December

On this picture evidence, though, not as
 much fun is being had in London, where festive-themed street signs are 
more common and treated with less enthusiasm.

Some of the signs pictured take a little bit of festive imagination, such as Noel Road, which takes a special pronunciation, and Star Road.

But in other cases - Reindeer Close and Holly Way - there can be no escaping the Christmassy significance of the names.

Turkey Street might get Enfield residents in the mood for their Christmas dinner, but they have to travel all the way to Tower Hamlets to find Cranberry Lane

Three Kings Yard in the City of Westminster, London, provides a festive name with a more biblical background

You have to use your imagination a little, but at least one resident of Star Road in Caversham, Reading, recognised the Christmas reference

For the more traditional Christmas celebrator, Manger Road and Three Kings Yard are also featured.

If you don't enjoy Christmas, you're best advised to stay away from these streets.

Equally, if you're not in the mood for a festive kiss, then learn from the mistakes of four-year-old Poppy Grout, who was caught out while posing for a photograph with her grandmother, Jane Long, in front of Mistletoe Green in Oxford.

For residents of Advent Way in North London, December can never seem to far off

Despite what the name might suggest, there are no stables for hire in Manger Road, Islington

Holly Street in Hackney acts as a constant reminder of Christmas in the London borough of Hackney
