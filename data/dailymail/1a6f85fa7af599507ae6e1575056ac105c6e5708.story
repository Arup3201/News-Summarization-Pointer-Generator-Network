Smokers beware - Queensland Health's latest anti-smoking campaign has revealed the shocking effect smoking has on your face, and it's not pretty. 

The campaign targets women aged 18 to 24, drawing on their desire to stay youthful and attractive. 

Young women were lured into a pop-up 'make under station' in Sunshine Plaza on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, where professional make-up artists brought their faces forward into the future as a smoker.

Smokers beware - Queensland Health's latest anti-smoking campaign has revealed the shocking effect smoking has on your face, and it's not pretty

The campaign targets women aged 18 to 24, drawing on their desire to stay youthful and attractive

The whole idea of the campaign is to highlight the premature ageing effects of smoking, rather than the black lung that is slowly developing inside.   

Queensland Health is sending out a message to smokers - 'Smoking is not hot!'

'Cigarettes seriously ruin your looks – we’re talking wrinkles, damaged hair and blotchy, saggy skin. You’ll look way older than you actually are. And let’s not forget the yellow teeth and bad breath. Go smoke free. Stay pretty,' Queensland Health writes on their website.

Photographs reveal a shock transformation, which means the chance of this  campaign reaching smokers might actually work.

No one wants to have blackened teeth, blotchy skin and withered lips - which is what Queensland Health has revealed.

Smoking breaks down the collagen supply, which means after 20 years of smoking your skin will not look pretty.

*Smoking causes instant damage to a smoker's hair, nails and skin

*Smoking increases production of an enzyme which breaks down the supply of collagen to the skins structure

 *Chemicals in tobacco smoke damage the fibres in the skin that are responsible for its strength and elasticity thus leading to wrinkles, sagging of the eye-lids, bags under the eyes and premature aging on our face and other parts of the body including breast sagging

 *Smoking is linked to early onset of menopause in women

Since its launch in May, more than 300 calls were made to the Quitline - an increase of more than 15 per cent, Sunshine Coast Daily reports.    

The images are a constant reminder of smoker's potential unattractive future, not to mention the deadly effects. 

New research has found more than 700 harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke, 70 of which could cause cancer. 

Australian model Rachael Finch has teamed up with Queensland Health to help spread the anti-smoking message across Australia.

It is safe to say that most of us would prefer to age beautifully like Ms Finch, rather than some of the after photos taken at the pop up station on the Sunshine Coast. 

If these pictures don't make you put down a cigarette, then what will?
