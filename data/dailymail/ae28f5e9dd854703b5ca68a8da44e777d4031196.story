A further 10 people remain in custody 
today after a night of disturbance in which fireworks were fired at 
Buckingham Palace and a blaze started just yards from its gates as 
hundreds of masked Anonymous protesters clashed with police.

The
 demonstrators - taking part in a global march against austerity cuts 
known as the Anonymous Million Mask Protest - threw glass bottles during
 confrontations with officers in riot gear.

Comedian Russell Brand, 38, joined in the protest as he used an
 opinion article in The Guardian to say that people riot ‘when dialogue 
fails, when they feel unrepresented and bored by the illusion’.

Police tried to shepherd the crowd in 
Central London, where a fire was started near the Victoria Memorial - 
and at least one man and woman were seen being taken away by officers.

Several similar events 
were carried out in cities in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, in 
opposition to austerity cuts, corruption and an increase in state 
surveillance.

Brand said in his piece: ‘We are 
living in a time of huge economic disparity and confronting ecological 
disaster. This disparity has always been, in cultures since expired, a 
warning sign of end of days.

‘In
 Rome, Egypt and Easter Island the incubated ruling elites, who had 
forgotten that we are one interconnected people, destroyed their 
societies by not sharing.

‘That
 is what's happening now, regardless of what you think of my hair or me 
using long words, the facts are the facts and the problem is the 
problem. Don't be distracted.’

Russell Brand

Brand has been pushing his political agenda over the past few weeks, with a clip of him being interviewed by Jeremy Paxman about his desire for a political revolution going viral on YouTube.

Ceylan Hassan,
 24, a university graduate, said of last night's protests: ‘They started shouting move back, move 
back, but we had nowhere to go.

'The police started pushing us, screaming "move back, move back". There
 was a fire on the right hand side of the monument and people started 
throwing things. We've been here from the start.'

Protesters
 were moved back away from Buckingham Palace as the atmosphere grew 
tense. Some of those involved in the march were seen ripping barriers 
from the side of the road.

Sean Roesner, 21, a self-employed 
computer programmer, travelled to the protest with his brother and 
friend from King's Lynn, Norfolk, this afternoon.

'When we arrived people were firing fireworks at the Palace. It was funny. I didn't have any but I would have fired some if I had'

Sean Roesner, protester

He
 said: ‘We turned up and the protest was at Buckingham Palace. When we 
arrived people were firing fireworks at the Palace. It was funny. I 
didn't have any but I would have fired some if I had.

‘I
 joined Anonymous because I was arrested under the Computer Misuse Act. I
 spent eight months on police bail last year and had done nothing wrong.
 We are here to stand up for what we believe in, to make the world a 
better place.’

Mr Roesner 
said his friend had been among a group of people encircled by the police
 on The Mall and was waiting for him to be released so they could return
 home.
