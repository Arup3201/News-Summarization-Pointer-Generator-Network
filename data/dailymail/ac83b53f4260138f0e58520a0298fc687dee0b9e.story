West Ham are ready to offer Diafra Sakho an improved contract ahead of schedule.

Co-chairman David Sullivan, who was instrumental in signing the striker from Metz in the summer, has been delighted with the 24-year-old's outstanding start to his Upton Park career.

Sakho has scored six goals in seven games following his £3.5million move which was in the balance until Sullivan revived it.

The striker's form has been such that France are exploring the possibility of calling him into their national squad even though he has already represented Senegal in a friendly.

Sakho agreed a four year deal but Sullivan wants to reward his form and will look at revising the figures in the new year.

Meanwhile, Bobby Mimms has been named new goalkeeper coach of West Ham United. The former Everton, Blackburn and Tottenham Hotspur keeper has been working with the Bahrain national side. 

Mimms, who succeeds Martyn Margetson, said: 'I got a phone call from Sam and he asked me if I would be interested to come down here and work with the goalies, and I was more than interested.'
