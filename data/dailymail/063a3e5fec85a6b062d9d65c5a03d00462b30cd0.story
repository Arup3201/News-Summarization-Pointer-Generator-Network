Weber Middle School in Port Washington, Long Island has banned ball playing during recess. According to school officials, the school district is undergoing a construction project that restricts the space in which children can play.

‘There is limited space for the students to enjoy a 20-minute recess period,’ said a statement from the school district. ‘It is not safe for them to be engaged in unstructured play with hard balls,’ it continued.

Port Washington Schools Superintendent Kathleen Maloney strongly
believes in the school’s decision to ban footballs, baseballs, lacrosse balls
and any other hard balls that could potentially injure a child. Games of tag and cartwheels are also off limits unless there is an adult present to supervise.

Hard balls like basketball, baseballs, footballs, and soccer balls are banned from recess due to limited space

According to a statement by the school, ‘Absent the confined
space within which recess must temporarily be held, such restrictions would not
be necessary.’

‘Some of these injuries can unintentionally become very
serious, so we want to make sure our children have fun, but are also protected,’
Maloney told CBS.

Students were disappointed upon hearing the news. ‘That’s all we want to do. We’re in school all day sitting behind the desk learning,’ one student told CBS.

Parents were also surprised and angered by the school’s restrictions during recess.

‘This isn't smart. It's actually counter-productive,' said parent Donna Daniels in an e-mail to CNN. ‘It saddens me to think that children no longer experience the joy of kickball, tag, dodgeball and simple outdoor games I remember so fondly when I reflect on my childhood. Our kids don't experience physical activity unless it involves downloading an app.’

Some parents believe that decision is a way for the school to avoid possible lawsuits in the case of an injury during recess.

The children are only permitted to use soft Nerf balls, except when they participate in gym class or intramural sports.

‘Children’s safety is paramount, but at the same time, you have to let them live life,’ said parent Ellen Cohen.

‘There are rational precautions (helmets for bikers) and then there is ridiculous. This is over the top,’ said parent Erika Hathaway Stockton on CNN’s Facebook page.

It’s rumored that the recess restrictions may spread to nearby school districts. School officials insist that enforcing strict rules minimizes student injuries for everyone's well-being.
