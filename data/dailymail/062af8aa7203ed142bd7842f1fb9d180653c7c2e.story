The race that stops the nation costs the economy more than $1 billion in lost productivity, figures show.

Research by HR firm Randstad found that 77 percent of working Australians spend three and a half hours or more celebrating the Melbourne Cup.

The survey found that 15 percent watch the race and participate in office sweepstakes before getting back to work, and just 8 percent are too busy to watch the race at all.

The survey, taken in 2010 but adjusted to account for the Australian Bureau of Statistics' current size of the workforce and average hourly wage, found that a conservative estimate of the Melbourne Cups' cost to productivity  is $1.2 billion.

Taking into account costs associated with employees taking Monday off, particularly in Victoria where Melbourne Cup Tuesday is a public holiday, and the loss of productivity over much of  Wednesday, the number would be much higher, Randstad's Mike Roddy said.

Paul Dundon, managing director of workplace absence management firm Direct Health Solutions, said figures show the number of full-time employees who call in sick on the Wednesday following Melbourne Cup day jumps by 25 percent.

With just over 8 million full-time workers in Australia, for employers that means an extra 80,000 people don't go to work at a cost of $24 million, Mr Dundon said.

This is based on the absenteeism rate jumping from the daily average of 4 percent to 5 percent, and the cost of a sick day costing employers $300.

Mr Roddy said the majority of Australian workers expect to engage in Melbourne Cup festivities at work.

'From lunchtime onwards tomorrow you only have to look in any foyer of any workplace and fascinators will be filling the room with people going to lunches or getting on the bus to go to the races,' Mr Roddy said.

'There are various lunches and functions in the office and it's almost like a graveyard shift between two and five o'clock.'

But Mr Roddy said bosses should take advantage of the benefits of organising a Melbourne Cup event, as it could motivate employees to work longer or harder later down the track.

'If you weren't to allow people to celebrate you could be perceived as draconian,' he said.

'It's an opportunity to use this as a tool for having bit of fun and connecting with your people.'

The race also puts a drain on Australians' purse strings thanks to increase in people gambling, buying new outfits for Melbourne Cup functions and the jump in spending at pubs, clubs and restaurants around the country.

But this spike in spending injects millions into the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors of the economy, particularly in Victoria.

Almost 14 million Australians will spend $400 million betting on the Melbourne Cup tomorrow, or an average of $29 each, according to insurance firm Asteron Life.

Last year the Melbourne Cup Carnival injected $177.5 million into Victoria's gross state product

Last year IBISWorld estimated that Melbourne Cup boosts spending on food and alcohol by $167.9 million thanks to the number of events at workplaces, bars, clubs, restaurants and private homes.

And a study undertaken on behalf of Victoria Racing Club found that last year the Melbourne Cup Carnival injected $177.5 million into Victoria's gross state product.

More than 48,000 visitors travelled to Victoria specifically for Melbourne Cup, spending $25.6 million on accommodation.

Retail spending for the Cup hit $53.1 million in Victoria alone, with race enthusiasts buying more than 62,000 hats and fascinators, 60,000 pairs of shoes, 50,000 dresses, 30,000 items of jewellery, 27,000 ties, 21,000 handbags, 18,000 suits, 17,000 items of underwear, 14,000 shirts, 11,000 pairs of sunglasses and 13,000 pairs of socks and pantihose.
