The TV ad featured the French footballer lauding the 'French' ingredients

Football icon Eric Cantona heralded France’s favourite beer, Kronenbourg 1664, and the farmers of Alsace who grow the hops used to produce it.

A British TV commercial and associated advertisements declared: ‘If you find a better tasting French beer, we’ll eat our berets’.

However, perhaps a better analogy would have been flat caps, for this ‘French’ beer is actually brewed in Manchester by the Dutch-owned brewer, Heineken.

Now, the Advertising Standards Authority(ASA) has banned the advertising campaign for misleading drinkers about the true origins of the lager.

The TV ad featured the French footballer, who spent much of his career at Manchester United, saying: ‘Here in Alsace, things are a little bit different. The hop farmers are treated like the footballers of Britain.

‘They are idolised and adored. And why not? They are living legends. They are the men that grow the noble hops that make Kronenbourg the taste supreme ...’

A second print advertisement made the point that the beer is brewed with Streisselspalt hop to produce ‘A taste supreme’.

However, an investigation found that the beer is not made in France, while these Steisselspalt hops make up only a small proportion of the four types that are used.

Heineken insisted that its advertisements were simply designed to highlight the beer’s French heritage and ingredients. At the same time, they said there was no danger of viewers being misled because the commercial carried smallprint text stating the beer was ‘Brewed in the UK’.

However, in a ruling published today, the ASA said the commercial was misleading. 

The Advertising Standards Authority has banned the advertising campaign for misleading drinkers about the true origins of the lager

An investigation found that the beer is not made in France, while the 'special' Steisselspalt hops make up only a small proportion of the four types that are used

It said: ‘Although we acknowledged 
Heineken’s arguments as to the beer’s heritage and the French origins of
 the recipe, we considered that the degree of emphasis in the ad on the 
connection with France would lead consumers to believe that the entire 
brewing and manufacturing process took place in that country.

‘The ad contained small print stating 
that the beer was brewed in the UK, but we considered that contradicted 
rather than clarified the main message of the ad.

The beer is made at the Royal Brewery in Manchester alongside 'Australian' lager Fosters, which is advertised using two typical alpha-male Aussies on a beach

'Because we considered 
that the overall impression created by the ad was that Kronenbourg 1664 
was brewed in France when it was not, we concluded that it was 
misleading.’

The ASA said it
 accepted that Strisselspalt hop from Alsace is used in the recipe. But 
it said it ‘did not constitute a significant majority of the total hops 
used in the recipe for the beer’.

The
 authenticity of the French identity and ingredients are not the only 
suspect elements about the beer. For while the name suggests it has been
 brewed since 1664, its origins are much more recent.

The
 lager was first developed in France in 1952 to celebrate the founder, 
Geronimus Hatt, who established the company in Strasbourg in 1664.

Global beer companies have developed something of a reputation for using their marketing to fudge the origins of their brews.

The Kronenbourg 1664 is made at the 
Royal Brewery in Manchester alongside the ‘Australian’ lager Foster’s, 
which is advertised using two typical alpha-male Aussies on a beach.

Heineken said it was ‘very disappointed’ by the ASA’s decision and has asked for the decision to be reviewed.

A
 spokesman said: ‘In creating our commercials, we work to the highest 
standards and are careful to operate within the letter and spirit of the
 relevant codes.

‘Kronenbourg
 1664 is French by any reasonable measure, including brand ownership, 
history, heritage and the authentic recipe used. We have never made any 
secret that it is also brewed in the UK, and indeed this fact is clearly
 communicated within the two commercials that were challenged; and on 
every bottle and can.

Local brew: Kronenbourg 1664 is brewed in Manchester

‘The 
Strisselspalt hop is a key ingredient, but it is very common in brewing 
to use a variety of hops to achieve the final unique taste of a beer.

‘Again, we have never claimed or implied the Strisselspalt is the only hop used, but we feel strongly that we should be able to celebrate the important role that this particular ingredient plays to the taste, aroma and character of the beer.

‘Whilst we must respect and comply with the ASA adjudication, we have already submitted a request to the Independent Reviewer of ASA Adjudications, for it to be reconsidered; as we believe that there were significant flaws in the ruling.

‘In the meantime, we have agreed that the two advertisements will not be used again in their current form.’
