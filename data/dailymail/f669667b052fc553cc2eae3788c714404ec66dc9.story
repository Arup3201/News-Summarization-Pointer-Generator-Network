A pensioner who claimed more than £16,000 in disability benefits insisting she could barely move was caught training her four dogs.

Sylvia Wootton, 68, said she struggled to walk more than 50 yards after a car accident in June 2008.

But suspicious investigators launched an undercover probe as Wootton continued to claim her handouts four years on.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Convicted: Sylvia Wootton, 68, was handed a three-month suspended sentence after this video emerged

Caught: She had told the DWP she could not walk 50 metres or lift pots and pans. But here she is, fully active

After weeks tracking her movements, they filmed her striding briskly around a canine obedience school - with fully-grown dogs in tow.

Training dogs is a notoriously strenuous activity, requiring a lot of physical interaction with hyperactive animals.

Wootton is seen walking quickly to catch up with one dog.

Later she pulls a disobedient dog forcefully to the other side of the field on a lead.

Clear: Investigators, suspicious she has not recovered after years, later confronted her with the evidence

Healthy: Wootton was seen chatting with a judge while bending over to play with her border collie

At the end, she emerges with four dogs on leashes bounding ahead of her as she keeps them under control.

Wootton trained her animals for a 
hobby despite telling officials she was unable to lift heavy pans or do 
household chores such as ironing, Plymouth Crown Court heard.

But
footage captured by the Department for Work & Pensions (DWP) 
captured her powering across a field and taking four dogs by their 
leads.

Andrew Maitland, prosecuting, said Wootton failed to tell officials when her condition improved and was overpaid £16,232 between June 2008 and December 2012.

Dishonest: Deni Matthews, defending, told Plymouth Crown Court Wootton showed 'genuine remorse'

Brisk stride: Canine obedience training is vigorous and requires a strong owner to control the wild dogs

Deni Matthews, defending, said 
Wootton, of Plymstock, Devon, had showed 'genuine remorse' and was still
suffering from arthritis.

Judge
Graham Cottle handed Wootton a three-month prison sentence suspended 
for two years after she pleaded guilty to dishonestly failing to notify a
change of circumstances.

He told Wootton: 'I believe the shame of what you did was probably enough punishment.

'I don’t think we will see you before the courts in the next two years.'

A DWP spokesperson said after the case: 'Benefit fraud is a crime and we are dedicated to catching those who commit it.'
