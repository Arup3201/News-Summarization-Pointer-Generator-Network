The wife and mother of missing Guma Aguiar have launched furious attacks on each other as they both wage a legal war to control the millionaire philanthropists $100 million fortune.

Court documents filed in Broward County Clerk of Courts yesterday by Jamie Aguiar allege that her mother-in-law Ellen Aguiar is 'incapable of looking out for the interest of anyone but herself.'

In her counter-petition to become the conservator, or temporary guardian of her husband's assets, Jamie accused her mother-in-law of becoming an 'impediment' to the investigation into Guma's disappearance after his empty boat washed up ashore on a Fort Lauderdale beach last week.

This comes as friends of Guma Aguiar said that he'd been spiraling out of control for years, and seemed troubled and confused shortly before he disappeared as he sought treatment for severe bipolar disorder.

'The lawsuits were taking a major toll on him. Emotionally. Mentally. He
was completely spent,' said Bob Denison, a 35-year-old yacht broker who
met Aguiar in high school.

The battle between 35-year-old Aguiar's mother and wife has led to three legal filings between the pair over who will eventually gain control of the family fortune.

'Rather than rally around her family in this most difficult of times, Ellen Aguiar instead focused on being first to the courthouse, petitioning this Court to serve in a position she is ill-suited to hold as she is incapable of looking out for the interest of anyone but herself,' Jamie Aguiar said in her filing, obtained by ABCNews.com.

Accusing her mother-in-law of tampering with 'critical pieces of evidence', including Guma Aguiar's cell phone and wallet, Jamie Aguiar's filed her petition on Monday.

'These items were subsequently returned by Ellen Aguiar's attorney, but not before she made a few phone calls and possibly deleted critical voice and/or text messages,' said Jamie Aguiar's legal team in her court filing.

son and wife Jamie were heading for a divorce before his empty boat 
washed up on a Florida beach

'While Jamie Aguiar has been home grieving and trying to add to the search efforts being conducted privately and in conjunction with the authorities, Ellen has been attempting to take control of the Jamie and Guma's assets without even providing Jamie with notice.'

Refuting these claims, Ellen Aguiar's attorney Richard Baron, was unequivocal.

'She's a liar,' remarked Baron speaking about Jamie Aguiar.

'Ellen Aguiar never asked for the phome.

'She never asked for the wallet. That's complete and utter fantasy.

'It's creative writing and it's a third-rate novel.'

Ellen Aguiar's attorney explained that the phone and wallet were handed to her when she arrived at the water front when police discovered her son's empty boat.

He explained that she checked her son's phone for any clues as to his disappearance but couldn't access his phone because she didn't know the password.

He added that she gave them to him and he handed them to the police.

Jamie Aguiar's legal petition alleges that she and her husband financially supported Ellen for years and gave her the use of a credit card, car and provided her with a home.

'Although Ellen Aguiar purports to have the best interest of her grandchildren at heart, the record will reveal that her actions consistently drove a wdge between the family by seemingly flaming the fumes of Guma Aguiar's paranoia,' said Jamie Aguiar's petition.

Accused of being a mother-in-law who 'consistently drove a wedge between the family,' Ellen Aguiar has suggested that Jamie Aguiar demanded a divorce from her son and that this contributed to his despondent mood as he boarded his 31-foot fishing boat.

'I'm of the belief that that's what pushed him over the deep end,' said Baron.

'He loved his wife. He did not want a divorce.'

Furthermore, Ellen Aguiar's petition claims that her son's property is in 'imminent danger' of being ,wasted, misappropriated, or lost,' by Jamie Aguiar.

The claim to administer Guma Aguiar's $100 million worth of assets alleges that Jamie Aguiar has fired her husband's employees, 'without any reason or justification whatsoever and without a majority vote.'

Last sighting: On this time-stamped CCTV footage, Mr Aguiar can be seen leaving his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida

Yesterday, a surveillance video from a South 
Florida port shows 35-year-old Guma Aguiar steering his boat into rough 
seas less than half an hour after leaving his home. It is the last known
image of the man whose boat washed ashore last week without him.

'I just stare at those pictures of 
him on that boat and can't help but be struck by the symbolism of him on
a vessel by himself in rocky seas, fighting a world that he probably 
felt like was crashing down on him,' said Wes Shelton, a close family 
friend who said Aguiar was troubled in the months before his 
disappearance.

Aguiar made a fortune in 2006 when the Texas-based energy company he ran with his uncle was sold for a reported $2.5 billion.

But he has been locked in a contentious legal battle with his uncle, Thomas Kaplan, over money. A phone call to Kaplan's attorney was not immediately returned Monday.

Meanwhile, his mother, Ellen Aguiar, who is fighting for control of his nearly $100 million dollar estate, has claimed she believes her son may have been in a delusional state or suffering from psychosis, according to court records.

She filed an emergency petition while rescuers were still searching for Aguiar's body last week.

Police called off their search Thursday night. There was no blood on the vessel and no evidence of foul play. Police have been reviewing the boat's GPS and Aguiar's cell phone, which was on the boat when it washed ashore with its engines still running Wednesday.

His wife Jamie has declined interview requests. They have four children who range in age from 10 months to 7 years.

Shelton said he knew of no significant emotional triggers just before Aguiar's disappearance but that he'd struggled for years with his mental health. Aguiar had been admitted to psychiatric hospitals several times.

Aguiar knew nothing of the oil and gas business when the company he started with his uncle while in his mid-20s struck oil.

'That was his compulsion, that was his obsession. He spent morning, noon and night trying to build that company,' said Shelton, who also worked at the company for a time.

But even after selling the company, for which he reportedly received more than $200 million, Aguiar struggled to find happiness. He took a Colorado ski trip with friends shortly after the sale. But while everyone else was relaxing, Aguiar was on his computer working.

'He used to ask me all the time, 'help me decompress, help me relax',' Shelton said. 'I didn't even know what that meant.'

Aguiar donated millions to a foundation that helps Jews move to Israel.

Denison said Aguiar also liked to give when no one was looking 'reaching out to the guy sleeping on the bus stop, finding a friend a job on the brink of hopelessness.'

Aguiar, whose mother is Jewish, was raised Christian but converted to Judaism about a decade ago. He became well-known in Israel after his $4 million investment saved the Israeli Premier League soccer team Beitar Jerusalem a few years ago.

But in Israel, he didn't know who to trust and felt he was only embraced because of his money, friends said.

'He had a lot of hurt and had a lot of regret due to what happened over there,' Shelton said, but declined to elaborate.

He pleaded no contest to drug charges in 2009 after deputies said they found marijuana in his Bentley during a traffic stop in South Florida. His family checked him into a psychiatric hospital in Tel Aviv in roughly a year later after he claimed he entered the Gaza Strip and met with an Israeli soldier held there by Hamas militants.

His wife filed a domestic violence order against him last summer. A short time later, he filed for dissolution of marriage, but both were voluntarily dismissed, according to court documents.

Life seemed to be turning around this year, according to friends. Aguiar was seeking treatment for bipolar disorder and was spending more time with his family, fishing and attending soccer games.

Not long before his disappearance, the family vacationed in the Florida Keys.

Friends said Jamie Aguiar desperately tried to create a peaceful home life for her husband and wasn't interested in big houses or cars. They married in 2006 before he made his fortune.

'That was all Jamie wanted for him,' said Shelton. 'I think Jamie was really hopeful that the old Guma would come back.'

Still, friends sensed that Aguiar wasn't at peace.

'He wasn't doing well. Guma was deeply burdened by the lawsuits he was fighting. I don't think I've ever heard him so confused,' Denison said of his last conversation with Aguiar a few weeks ago.
