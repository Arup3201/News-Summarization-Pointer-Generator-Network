For the fans of one non-league soccer club, football really is an art form.

Lewes FC is using eye-catching posters with iconic images from films like the Magnificent Seven and even Soviet wartime propaganda to promote games.

The posters, put up throughout the East Sussex town on matchdays, have become a cult hit with supporters.

Big match: The Sex Pistols album publicising the home game with Kingstonian

Attendances at the Ryman Premier League club's Dripping Pan ground used to be an average 433, but it has risen to 600 since the club officials came up with the idea.

Club director Charlie Dobres told the Independent: 'This is a small town of 16,000 people but is so bonkers and pro-active it's just the kind of place to do this sort of thing.

He was one of six founders of the Rook 125 group which saved the club from going bust three years ago and turned it into a Barcelona-style club owned by fans.

Mr Dobres added: 'We wanted to return the club to its community roots. We wanted the posters to be an expression of that.

'They evolved to a theme that fits us, the town and the club which is deliberately irreverent and plugged into the multicultural media.'

The club, battling against the threat of relegation, has played at the Dripping Pan since 1885 and has a capacity of 3000.

Each poster, produced by the Brighton design firm 
East Web, draws on a number of cultural references, including the Sex Pistols.

Posters: The club uses images from the past to publicise its home games against Hastings and the Met P:olice

For the game against Canvey Island on
Mother's Day this Sunday, the club have used a image from World War Two
of Russia urging its people to be proud of the motherland.

Against the Met Police on Valentine's Day last month, the match poster showed the Banksy image of two policemen kissing.
