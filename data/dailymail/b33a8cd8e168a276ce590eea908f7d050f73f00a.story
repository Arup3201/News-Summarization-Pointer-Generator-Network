The federal government employee who accidentally crashed a small drone onto the White House grounds early on Monday was drunk at the time of the incident, officials said.  

He lost control of the drone, which belonged to a friend, while operating it from an apartment just blocks away from the mansion.

The man, an employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, then texted friends that he was worried the drone might have crashed at the White House before going to sleep, according to the New York Times. 

A federal government employee was drunk when he accidentally crashed a small drone on the White House Lawn (pictured) early Monday. He contacted the Secret Service the next day and said he had not intended for it to go near the White House and that he had been flying it for fun

The Secret Service searched the North Lawn on Monday morning to see if anything else might be on the ground. Agents were investigating the man's text messages and phone records, as well as interviewing people he had been in contact with before the incident, to corroborate his account

The man remains unidentified and his employer, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, did not specify if any disciplinary action would be taken 

He contacted the Secret Service the next morning after reports of the crash spread across the media, and told the agency he had been flying the drone for fun.

The man remains unidentified and has yet to be charged with a crime. 

It is illegal to operate a drone in Washington.  

The  pre-dawn incident triggered a major emergency response and raised fresh questions about security at the mansion.

Secret Service agents were investigating the man's text messages and phone records, as well as interviewing people he had been in contact with before the incident, to corroborate his account.

Emergency vehicles surrounded the southeast corner of the White House during the pre-dawn incident, which triggered a major emergency response 

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which provides map-based intelligence and geospatial data to support the nation's military forces, confirmed yesterday a government employee had been questioned by the Secret Service in connection with the security breach. 

In a statement a spokesman said the employee was off-duty and is not involved in work 'related to drones or unmanned aerial vehicles in any capacity at NGA'. 

It said the agency was taking the incident seriously but did not specify if any disciplinary action would be taken.  

The drone, a DJI Phantom model, was too small to be detected by the White House's radar system. 

It it designed to detect flying objects such as planes, missiles and large drones. 

President Obama responded to the incident on Tuesday, referring to the drone that crashed in his backyard as 'one you buy in Radio Shack', in a CNN interview.

'There are incredibly useful functions that these drones can play…but we don't really have any regulatory structure at all for it.

'I've assigned some of the relevant agencies...to figure out how we're going to put an architecture in place to make sure these things aren't dangerous and that they aren't violating people's privacies. 

'These technologies that we're developing have the capacity to empower individuals in ways that we couldn't even imagine 10-15 years ago.' 

The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours on Monday morning after the crash. 

President Obama and his wife were not home at the time, but his daughters Sasha and Malia were. 

A U.S. Secret Service officer on duty saw and heard the two-foot-wide commercial drone fly at a low altitude into the heavily guarded complex and crash on the southeast side at 3.08am, the agency said.

Josh Earnest, the White House Press Secretary, confirmed the discovery of the drone on Monday and said it did not appear to pose an ongoing threat to anyone in the building. 

The White House saw an increased security presence the morning of the incident as emergency vehicles with lights flashing were clustered near the southeast entrance to the mansion.

A security perimeter was set up around the White House to restrict access. 

There has been a string of security breaches at the White House in recent months.

In September, an army veteran with a knife hidden in his pants jumped the fence and made it as far into the East Room before he was tackled.

The breach led to Secret Service director Julia Pierson's resignation. 

Just 24 hours later, a college student drove up to the White House's security screening point and refused to leave, prompting his arrest. 

The White House was briefly on lockdown this August after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates.

The White House has seen a string of security breaches in recent years, with over 40 fence jumpers making it on to the estate in the past five years, including four in just the last year. 

Other incidents have included a wandering toddler, a naked man, and eager reality stars. 

October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs  and arrested by the Secret Service.

September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured.

The shocking security breach  launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation.

Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. 

And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn.

August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates.

May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. 

June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House.

November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for.
