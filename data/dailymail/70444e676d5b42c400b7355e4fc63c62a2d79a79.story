A married couple boating on a lake both drowned after jumping into the water to rescue their small dog, authorities said today.

Daniel and Patricia Cyr, 64 and 61, respectively, were in a small boat on Hampton Ponds, Massachusetts last night when their dog Sady jumped into the water, Westfield police said in a written statement.

According to investigators, Mr Cyr first jumped into the water, and was followed by his wife, after he ‘became distressed.’ Neither was wearing life jackets, authorities said.

Tragic: Married couple Daniel and Patricia Cyr both drowned Monday night in Hampton Ponds, Massachusetts, after trying to rescue their dog

Sole survivor: The couple's dog, a West Highland White Terrier named Sady, was the only one to survive the incident in the lake

The couple was on the seemingly placid Hampton Ponds yesterday evening when their female terrier jumped into the water, MassLive.com reported.

Mr Cyr then jumped into the water to try and rescue their beloved pet, police said, but became distressed.

That’s when Mrs Cyr leapt into the water to try and rescue her husband. 

According to the Westfield News, two jet skiers on the lake heard Mrs Cyr’s cries for help and were able to flag down a nearby boater, who pulled the 61-year-old Mrs Cyr from the water.

Another jet ski rider managed to pull her husband onto their vessel and quickly drove him to shore.

Small town: The couple lived in Westfield and were boating on Hampton Ponds, around 13 miles outside of Springfield

Westfield Deputy Fire Chief Pat Kane told the Westfield News that when his crew arrived, Mrs Cyr was being taken ashore.

He
told the paper: ‘CPR was in progress by civilians (attempting to 
revive) that victim, who was then transported to the Holyoake Hospital.’

MassLive.com reports that Mr Cyr was taken to nearby Noble Hospital. Tragically, neither of the Westfield residents survived.

However,
their West Highland White Terrier Sady was found alive by Detective 
Daniel Gustafson and was then turned over to the municipal animal 
shelter.

Authorities continue to investigate their deaths.
