A jilted husband built a confinement room at an abandoned farmhouse to imprison the woman who supported his ex-wife.

Robert Edwin White insisted he never intended to hurt or kill anyone and that no one other than himself had been in the dungeon he built in the basement of a farmhouse in Pickering, Southern Ontario, Canada, when arrested earlier this year according to facts read out in court on Wednesday.

Investigations revealed the insulated dungeon - lockable only from the outside - was intended for a woman White planned to kidnap after she assisted his ex-wife emotionally and financially after the couple’s separation.

The room, in an empty farmhouse on Pickering airport lands slated for demolition, was discovered by a worker last November.

It was heavily reinforced with double-paned windows and a three-inch door made of multiple sheets of plywood, prosecutor Dave Slessor told Ontario Court Justice Mary Teresa Devlin.

Chains hung from the ceiling, there was a bench in the newly-painted room and the door was bolted from the outside with tyre irons, the court heard.

Mr Slessor said: ‘It can’t be opened from the inside once it’s bolted from the outside.’

The farmhouse was then destroyed by a deliberately-lit fire but no evidence linked White to the fire according to police.

Court documents obtained by CBS News told how White’s wife of ten months left him the day police arrived at their home in Oshawa, Ontario with a search warrant. She filed for divorce soon after on January 30.

His wife said in her application that she had begun experiencing ‘emotional and verbal abuse’ last summer. The document also revealed that she had moved into a shelter for fear White might harm her or her daughter.

The 44-year-old was arrested on February 13 and charged with attempted kidnapping and break and enter with intent to commit an indictable offence but the kidnapping charge was dropped when he pleaded guilty to the break and enter charge.

Security staff patrolling the area had recorded the number plate of White’s Mercedes-Benz after it was seen parked near the farmhouse on a few occasions.

Paul Affleck, defending, said White agreed with the facts read into the record but insisted he did not intend to demand a ransom for his kidnapping target.

White remains in custody awaiting a sentencing hearing.

Confinement rooms have been used in various crimes around the world.

Connell C. Williams from Oklahoma allegedly starved to death his girlfriend’s 10-year-old son and locking him in a room for months as punishment for eating too many sweets in May last year.

Kidnappers in Poland snatched a 19-year-old student and locked him in a tiny DIY cell for nearly two weeks. They threatened to kill the boy if his wealthy father did not pay a £200,000 ransom but he was rescued by police who raided the dingy bunker in May.
