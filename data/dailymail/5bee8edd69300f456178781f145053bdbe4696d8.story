The search for justice in Ferguson has spilled onto the football field as protestors say they plan to get into Edward Jones Dome and stop this weekend's St. Louis Rams game.

The threat was first revealed at a St. Louis County Council meeting Tuesday night.

'It's not going to be a fun day Sunday at your beautiful Rams game,' one protestor reportedly shouted.

Demanding justice for the death of Michael Brown, demonstrators say they'll stop this weekend's Rams game if Brown's shooter officer Darren Wilson is not arrested

Demonstrators demanded that for the game to go on, officer Darren Wilson, must be arrested and that County Prosecutor Robert McCullock be taken off the case

KMOX reports that St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson is doing whatever he can to stop those threats from becomingÂ  a reality.

'We are having extra resources in the downtown area for this weekend to address any eventuality,' he said.

He said that if a peaceful demonstration was held he would not interfere, but if they go beyond that the police will shut them down.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that protestors at the meeting grew increasingly loud and angry, demanding that officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, be arrested and that County Prosecutor Robert McCullock be taken off the case, as well as calling for the resignations of both County Police Chief Jon Belmar and Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson.

Speakers demanded 6th District Democractic councilman Steve Stenger as McCulloch to hand in his resignation by noon on Wednesday.

'12 Noon, Stenger! 12 Noon, Stenger!' they shouted.

'We will do everything in our power on election day because we see you sitting there with a smug look on your face,' said one unidentified speaker to Stenger. 'We will have our say in November when we go to vote.'

Other speakers compared county officials to 'war criminals' or KKK members.

Demonstrators also promised to disrupt grocery stores and hold an even bigger protest if the Cardinals make it to the World Series

'You are ISIS to black people,' one said.

Besides threatening this weekend's game, protestors said they would disrupt grocery stores as well as hold an even bigger demonstration should the Cardinals make it to this year's World Series.

A video posted on YouTube titled 'St. Louis Rams: No Justice, No Football,' is even asking for donated tickets so more demonstrators can get into the game.

'So all of those St. Louis Rams fans who love justice, I will ask you to
 contact me and to donate your St. Louis Rams tickets so protestors can 
get in the dome,' says activist Umar Lee in the video.
