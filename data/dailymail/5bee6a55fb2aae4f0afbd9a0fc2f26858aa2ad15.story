Prince Harry's visit to Oman this week has been thrown into jeopardy after the country's ruler, Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said, was forced to travel to Germany for medical treatment.

As a result, parts of the programme, including a parade, have been cancelled, while the Sultan's cousin, Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said, will welcome the British royal at the airport in his place.

This is the second time the 73-year-old ruler, who has been on the throne for 44 years, has had to seek medical help in Germany in three months.

Unwell: Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said has had to travel to Germany for medical treatment

In August, Sultan Qaboos travelled to Europe for a routine check-up and was declared in good health - much to his delight.

Immediately after returning to Oman, the Sultan, who has no children and thus no heirs, issued a statement that read:

'The Diwan of Royal Court is honoured to reassure the loyal citizens of Oman that His Majesty Sultan Qaboos is in sound health after conducting medical tests, which His Majesty will continue over the coming period in accordance with a specific medical programme.'

But his health has deteriorated in recent weeks and Wednesday's National Day Parade, which would have been the centrepiece of Harry's visit, has been cancelled.

Nevertheless, the 30-year-old will still travel to the country and will visit the British Embassy in Muscat, following a ceremonial welcome at Muscat Airport.

During his visit to Oman, Harry will also travel to the historic Nizwa Fort, where he will be greeted with a traditional sword dance.

Built in the 1650s, the Fort is the work of Imam Sultan Bin Saif Al Ya’rubi and is Oman's most visited national monument.

After two days in Oman, the royal will travel on to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, to take part in the Sentebale Polo Cup at Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club. 

The event, which will help raise funds for Harry's Lesotho-based AIDs charity Sentebale, will also include a charity dinner, during which he will make a speech.

Harry hopes that the extra funds will allow the charity to scale up the Mamohato Programme, which addresses the emotional and psychological needs of children living with HIV. 

The Mamohato Children's Centre is due to be completed in June 2015 and marks the beginning of Sentebale's plans to expand, both in Lesotho and across southern Africa.
