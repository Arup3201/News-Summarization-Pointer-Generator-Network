Imagine watching a film with a friend on the same screen where you watch it through the eyes of the villain, but they have the hero’s perspective.

That’s just one of the many uses for Invisivision glasses, a product developed by PipeDream Interactive based in Ontario, Canada.

The ‘smart glasses’ have an additional layer of lenses that can flip up and down, giving viewers two different experiences - or even entirely different films - when staring at a cinema screen.

Canadian company Pipedream Interactive have unveiled their Invisivision glasses (pictured), which they say can provide viewers with different movie-watching experiences. When the lenses are flipped up and down they switch between two image streams, something that is commonly seen in 3D movies

The company are currently seeking funding for their design on Kickstarter.

The patent-pending eyewear uses filters to separate streams of 3D images.

Dual perspectives – Watch a scene through one of two views, such as through the eyes of the hero or the villain.

Reveal and conceal – Flipping the glasses could show and hide subtitles in multiple languages.

Adult content – The company says the glasses could let a parent and child, for example, switch between a PG and 18-rated version of a scene.

Hidden scenes – Additional content could be hidden within a scene using the glasses.

Video games – The glasses could be used to hide objects and easter eggs in video game worlds.

Changed vision – Invisivision glasses could also be used to enhance gameplay, such as giving the player night-vision.

By interspersing content within rapidly alternating frames of a movie, the technology could allow for some novel applications.

These range from giving dual perspectives during a movie to providing subtitles for only those that want to see them.

‘When viewing content with Invisivision, the user simply moves the additional lenses in front to reveal hidden content,’ the company writes on Kickstarter.

‘Moving the additional lenses back restores the original content.’

The glasses make use of the fact that 3D movies work when two image streams are displayed simultaneously, but they are slightly offset.

‘In 3D entertainment, our brains then combine the two nearly-identical images, and thus depth is created,’ says the company.

Using the two image streams separately, the illusion of two completely different scenes is created.

In addition, having one side of the glasses up and the other down will produce a standard 3D effect.

Later this year the company is planning to show off the technology in a movie they created with actors JP Manoux and Aaron Ashmore.

And backers of the project on Kickstarter will be given early access to the premiere.

One of the touted uses for the technology is the ability to watch hidden scenes from a movie by flipping up or down the lenses. Here, for example, only viewers with the glasses flipped in one direction will see the 'monster' sneaking up on actor JP Manoux
