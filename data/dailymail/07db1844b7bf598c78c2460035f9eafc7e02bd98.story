Despite costing upwards of Â£4,000, almost 5,000 people opt for a facelift every year. But splashing out thousands of pounds doesn't always guarantee a good result.

Indeed, as 57-year-old retired nurse, Yvonne, from Herefordshire discovered, it doesn't always mean that anything has been done at all.

Shockingly, Yvonne, who had a face and neck lift in 2011, was left with more wrinkles than when she began thanks to a rogue surgeon who failed to complete the procedure.

Devastated: Yvonne was distraught when her facelift was botched so badly, her face collapsed

Instead, as she later discovered, he had used liposuction to produce a smooth result but had managed to inflict catastrophic damage to her facial muscles at the same time.

As a result, less than a year after she had the treatment, Yvonne's face collapsed, leaving her with sagging skin and wrinkles 'more suited to a woman in her 70s'.

Yvonne, who says she has barely left the house in three years because of the disaster, says: 'There's no other way to describe it, really, other than a nightmare. I just don't want this face.

'I had my eyes done, upper and lower, 
face and neck,' she adds. But less than a year later 'I seemed to have blinked and [the facelift] had gone.

'The neck had 
dropped, the chin had dropped and shortly after, the rest of face had 
gone too.

'It's caused me so much stress, anxiety 
and heartache - you name it, I've been there this last couple of years 
or so because of this.'

Change: After being unable to leave home for three years, Yvonne has now had the neck lift she wanted

Although Yvonne returned to the original doctor and asked him to fix the botched facelift, his efforts only made things worse, as cosmetic surgeon Dr Vik Vijh points out.

'Yvonne is a classic example of a patient, who's gone in looking for one type of operation and been given a different one,' he says.

Speaking during a consultation filmed for TLC documentary, Extreme Beauty Disasters, he adds: 'I can't see that anyone's touched [the] neck so that's why it was back 
down within a month.'

To add insult to injury, Yvonne's first surgeon even tried to convince her that her face was drooping not because of his shoddy work, but because she hadn't chosen to have Botox as well.

'When you get a patient like Yvonne, where they've had surgery but it's
 not right, and you tell them it's not right, the first emotion they 
have is relief that they're not mad,' adds Dr Vijh.

Relieved: Yvonne says she feels 'marvellous' and hopes to be able to live a normal life once more

'But then that turns to anger as they
 realise they were lied to, as they realise that what they paid for 
isn't what they've got.'

Unfortunately for Yvonne, fixing the damage means another operation to lift the neck and plump up the skin with fat taken from another part of the body, and a peel to minimise fine lines.

'I'm hoping that it'll give me back some of the self-confidence that I've lost over the years,' adds Yvonne.

Six weeks after surgery and Yvonne's muscles are mended and her face well on the way to looking normal again.

'I'm just feeling ecstatic. I just really can't put it into words,' she enthuses, despite the swathe of bandages still covering her face.

Dr Vijh is more circumspect. 'I just hope now she has the confidence to get up, get out, start seeing her friends again and live a normal life,' he says.
