Love them or hate them, the chances are that you will eat at least one Brussels sprout this Christmas.

And now there's more to go round, because growers of the festive vegetable claim that the are the largest in a decade - at up to 30 per cent larger than usual - thanks to extra sunshine in September and October.

While many may lament larger sprouts, experts claim they are in fact sweeter and tastier.

Big and sweet: Growers of Brussels sprouts claim that they are at the largest in a decade, at up to 30 per cent larger than usual, thanks to ‘extra’ sunshine in September and October

Experts say that ‘near perfect growing conditions’ are responsible for the super-sized sprouts - citing unexpected extra sunshine, as well as just the right amount of rain and cooler temperatures later in autumn, as reasons for the bumper crop.

Brussels sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane, a product of the glucosinolates.

While research is ongoing, studies suggest that sulforaphanes may protect against degenerative brain diseases and even cancer.

This compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigated for antioxidant properties. 

‘Not only are the sprouts generally larger this year but the overall quality is also better because of all the extra sunshine,’ Tesco vegetable buyer Luke Shutler said.

‘The larger size also means less work in the kitchen as the bigger they are the easier they will be to peel.

‘We also think that customers might find that they taste sweeter than in recent years.’

As a result, Tesco expects the vegetable to be more in demand than ever this year. 

It’s estimated that as much as 80 per cent of total British sprout sales take place in the two week Christmas and New Year period.

British sprout growers are set to produce 7,000 tons of sprouts, or 50 million individual sprouts, which is the weight of 600 London buses.

TH Clements, which is based in Benington, near Boston in Lincolnshire, is one of the UK’s largest suppliers of brassica, including Brussels sprouts.

Brassica is a genus of plants in the mustard family and members include other cruciferous vegetables such as cabbages and the mustard plant.

Richard Mowbray, commercial manager for TH Clements said: 'Not only did we have plenty of sunshine during the summer and into the autumn but also regular amounts of rainfall which created near enough perfect growing conditions.

‘Apart from being whoppers we believe this year’s sprouts taste sweeter and we have even taken to baking sprout cakes for staff and friends.’

Growers at TH Clements have made 'sprout cakes' for friends.

Ingredients: 

Two eggs, 150g sugar, ½ tsp cinnamon, 100ml vegetable oil, 125g self-raising flour, 125g carrots, 125g Brussels sprouts, 25g walnuts (or other nuts), 50g Dried Mixed fruit and ½ tsp fresh ginger, grated

• Cook in the oven at 180C for 50 to 60 minutes until cooked in the middle

Hate sprouts? You've got a new excuse: A chemistry teacher argues that there may be a chemical and genetic reason why some people can’t stand the taste of Brussels sprouts

A chemistry teacher has created an infographic explaining the chemistry and genetics behind why some people can’t stand the taste of bitter vegetables.

Those who loathe the seasonal greens, Andy Brunning explains, may be especially sensitive to naturally occurring chemical compounds called glucosinolates.

The Bournemouth-based teacher, who runs the blog Compound Interest, explained that these compounds are broken down into chemicals called isothiocyanates when the vegetable is cooked.

These compounds, while bitter to everyone, taste especially unpalatable to almost three quarters of humans.

'If you’re a Brussels sprouts hater, you can now suggest a potential chemical reason for your dislike if you’re ever berated for your perceived vegetable prejudice,’ he writes.

Brussels sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane, which is a product of the glucosinolates.

While research is ongoing, it suggests that sulforaphanes may protect against neurodegenerative diseases and even cancer.

This compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigate for its antioxidant properties.
