An Ohio judge has ordered a man convicted of harassing a neighbor and her disabled children to stand on a street corner with a sign that says 'I AM A BULLY!'The municipal court judge Gayle Williams-Byers says 62-year-old Edmond Aviv of South Euclid must hold the sign for five hours on Sunday. Aviv also must serve 15 days in jail and undergo anger management classes and counseling.

Court records say Aviv has feuded with his neighbor Mike Prugh and his adopted children for 15 years. He recently pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct.

Mike Prugh says he's been horribly bullied by his neighbor for 15 years

Edmond Aviv, 62,  has called Prugh's adopted daughter an ethnic slur, spit on her and smeared feces on the family's wheelchair ramp

'I would hope that's what's been achieved here is finally the modicum of justice that they had been hoping for for quite some time,' said Williams-Byers.

The Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland reports that the neighbor says Aviv has called Prugh's adopted daughter an ethnic slur, spit on her and smeared feces on the family's wheelchair ramp.Â 

'You wonder every time you walk outside, you turn to your left to see if your neighbor is there spitting, yelling, screaming at you and you don't know why,"' said Prugh.

Aviv offered his 'sincere apology' in a court-ordered apology letter.

'Move on with your life, hopefully they can move on with their lives, and we can live in peace,' said Prugh.

WKYC reports that South Euclid Councilwoman Ruth Gray wants to know why prosecutors didn't bring harsher charges against Aviv.

'I'm disturbed. I think that we as a community need to ask some questions,' said Gray.

If Aviv doesn't stop harassing his neighbors he will go back to jail.
