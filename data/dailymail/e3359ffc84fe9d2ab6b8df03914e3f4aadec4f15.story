Let off with a fine: Jeremy Sutton with his Saluki dog Clement, which attacked a seven-year-old boy

The mother of a schoolboy whose face was savaged by a dog today criticised the ‘soft’ court sentence given to its Labour activist owner.

Jeremy Sutton’s Saluki dog Clement attacked the seven-year-old child on the street near his home in Levenshulme, Manchester.

It left the boy with serious wounds to his face and lip and a lost front tooth - putting him in hospital for a week and leaving lifelong scars.

But appearing at Manchester Magistrates’ Court, 64-year-old Sutton was given a conditional discharge after admitting having a dog dangerously out of control last July.

Sutton was chair of Levenshulme Labour Party, but resigned on the day he pleaded guilty.

He was ordered to pay £1,000 compensation to the youngster and £500 to his parents. The court imposed a raft of conditions that saved Clement from being put down.

Now, the boy’s mother has spoken out against the sentence. She said: ‘I do think the dog should be put down so it doesn’t happen to other children. I’m not bothered about compensation - this is about my son and other children.

‘My son has not been the same since the accident. He seems to have lost confidence. He used to be very outgoing about playing outside but ever since the attack he won’t go beyond the garden.

‘He still gets very panicky around dogs and he often sees the dog that attacked him in the park. Often in the morning he’s very shaky, so I think he’s having nightmares about what happened.

Attack: The youngster was playing outside when he approached Sutton and his dog, a Saluki - a hunting breed. His mother said the first she knew was the sound of her son's scream

‘He talks about not wanting it to happen to other children.’

The boy, who can’t be identified for legal reasons, added: ‘I am okay with puppies but I don’t like big dogs any more. I’d like the dog that bit me to go away.’

The youngster was playing outside when he approached Sutton and his dog, a Saluki - a hunting breed. His mother said the first she knew was the sound of her son’s scream.

She added: ‘When you hear the scream and you just know that’s your child it’s terrifying. There was blood everywhere, all over his face. He was in hospital for a week.’

The boy, who needs ongoing dental treatment, may also need a further operation on his lip.

Boy's mother

At the hearing, Sutton’s solicitor Patrick Regan said the dog had been on a lead and had acted completely out of character and Sutton could not have foreseen the incident.

The court heard that a behaviour expert described the dog as a ‘well-balanced animal’.

The conditions Sutton will have to adhere to include the dog being muzzled and on a lead in public, and muzzled in the house when children under 16 are present.

The dog can also not enter the area used by the boy. If Sutton fails to comply with the conditions, then the dog can be put down.

Passing sentence, Chairwoman Catherine Beavis said ‘This was a very nasty incident which has left the boy with distressing and continuing injuries’.

After the hearing, Mr Sutton said: ‘It was a horrible, horrible accident. The dog did not approach the child, the child approached him. Unfortunately I was distracted at that time and was looking at my other dog, which children were petting.

'I have apologised in person to the boy’s mother, I accept responsibility as I was in charge of the dog. He’s sweet-tempered. He’s never done anything like that before or since'

Jeremy Sutton, dog owner

‘Clem doesn’t like being stroked when he’s out on his lead and I didn’t see or hear the boy come up, partly because I’m deaf in one ear. It was one quick snap as a warning but it got the boy’s lip. It was awful and I still think about it all the time.

‘I have apologised in person to the boy’s mother, I accept responsibility as I was in charge of the dog. He’s sweet-tempered. He’s never done anything like that before or since. And since that day he’s never been outside the house without a muzzle.’

He added: ‘I resigned from the party on the day I pleaded guilty. I’ve been involved in the Labour Party for 30 years, it was important to me but it did not seem right to still hold that position after I had pleaded guilty.

‘This was a one-off and I will do everything necessary to make sure nothing like it happens again.’
