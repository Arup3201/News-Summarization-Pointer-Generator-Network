A talented teenager who dreamed of making Team GB died in her sleep just hours before she was due to take part in an athletics competition.

Allegra Whittome, 16, was preparing to take part in a Hampshire League athletics competition when she fell ill last weekend.

The private school pupil was taken to Southampton General Hospital but died in her sleep as a result of a rare brain injury, her family said.

She is the daughter of former banker Ashley Whittome, now a company director and property tycoon,  who has previously ranked on the Sunday Times rich list.

In a statement, Mr Whittome and his wife Lucy, who are from Arlesford in Hampshire, said: ‘We are devastated by our sudden loss and have requested privacy at this terrible time.

‘Allegra was the most perfect daughter and sister that anyone could imagine. She was always smiling and full of enthusiasm for life. She loved sport, animals and her friends and family. Nothing will ever replace her.’

An inquest into her death is due to open in the next few days.

Allegra was a Year 11 pupil at St Swithun’s private girls’ school in Winchester, where she was both an academic and sports scholar.

She competed for Winchester and District Athletics Club (WADAC) and represented the school and Hampshire county at lacrosse, athletics and cross-country. 

The St Swithun's pupil was also a highly skilled equestrian, pentahlete, tennis and netball player

She was also a highly skilled equestrian, pentathlete, tennis and netball player and her greatest ambition was to become a Team GB athlete.

She had been due to compete for her club at a Hampshire League athletics competition on Saturday but had to drop out the day before.

Pete Spelman, chairman of WADAC, paid tribute to Allegra: ‘She was a top all-round athlete who competed regularly for WADAC, Hampshire and St Swithun’s School.

'She was a massive team player and was loved by all her teammates. 

'Only on Friday Allegra’s mum got in touch to say how sorry Allegra was not to be able to compete on Saturday as she wasn’t feeling too good. 

'We shall all miss her big time.’

St Swithun’s headmistress Jane Gandee revealed that Allegra undertook a number of charitable initiatives while at the school, including cutting off her hair to donate to the Little Princess Trust cancer charity in December 2013. 

She also introduced her school to a charity called edClub, which helps to improve the education of disadvantaged Kenyan children in a slum in Nairobi. 

Ms Gandee described Allegra as 'an enormously talented and outstanding pupil' both in the classroom and on the sports field.

She said: 'Her generous spirit touched everyone she met.

'She was so competitive while also open and kind to everyone, and with such determination to do the right thing - Allegra's enthusiasm and determination were legendary.

'We all admired her steadfast moral compass, most recently demonstrated in the assembly she led last week on Tuesday morning.

'She had a wonderful sense of humour and she will be greatly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family at this most difficult of times.' 

Mr Whittome left Credit Suisse in 2002 and co-founded Avon Capital Estates, an industrial property fund. He is also involved in property through Hampshire-based companies. 

Her family described her as 'the perfect daughter' who was 'always smiling and full of enthusiasm for life'
