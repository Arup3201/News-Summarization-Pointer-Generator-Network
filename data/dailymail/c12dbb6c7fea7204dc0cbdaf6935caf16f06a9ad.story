Beaming: Ruth Wright, 48, was able to avoid a hysterectomy thanks to MR-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery

A revolutionary no-knife procedure  is being used to treat fibroids – and it  could save thousands of women from a hysterectomy.

It uses a high-energy, focused ultrasound beam to heat and destroy the fibroid without the need for invasive surgery and anaesthetic – resulting in a far shorter recovery time.

The beam is guided through continuous Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that allows the surgical team to see inside the body.

‘This is a revolutionary procedure,’ says consultant interventional radiologist Dr Paul Crowe, who offers the treatment at Spire Parkway hospital in Birmingham. He has treated 15 cases so far in collaboration with consultant gynaecologist Shirin Irani.

‘As well as needing no general anaesthetic, it is non-invasive. Recovery is faster and there are few risks of complication or side effects.’

Fibroids are common tumours on the wall of the uterus and are usually benign.

‘About 25 per cent of women of child-bearing age have them, and up to 40 per cent in later life,’ says Dr Crowe. ‘Although some women have no idea they even have them, a substantial number need treatment.’

Treatment is recommended if the fibroids cause symptoms, which can include heavy bleeding, pressure  on the bladder or bowel – meaning increased urination, bloating or constipation – or fertility problems.

‘There is an association with early miscarriage, or in later pregnancy there may be a problem with space,’ says Dr Crowe. ‘It’s not known why they cause heavy bleeding but they grow in response to oestrogen.’

Most treatments involve surgery, with many women having a hysterectomy – removal of the uterus. Half the 50,000 hysterectomies done on the NHS every year are fibroid-related. This operation can take two hours under general anaesthetic, requires a hospital stay and patients can take eight weeks to recover.

Company director Ruth Wright, 48, was advised to have a hysterectomy when she developed fibroids. She had been suffering heavy bleeding.

‘Some days I couldn’t leave the bathroom,’ she says. ‘It was a nightmare. I was dragging myself to work every day, through the school run and supper, and couldn’t ride my beloved horses for more than ten minutes without being exhausted.’

After several months, her doctor found she was anaemic and prescribed Depo-Provera, a progesterone contraceptive injection that often stops periods altogether. When that didn’t work, Ruth had a scan.

‘The radiologist said I had fibroids so large it was as if I was carrying an 18-week foetus,’ she recalls.

How it is done: MSgFUS uses a high-energy, focused ultrasound beam to heat and destroy the fibroid without the need for invasive surgery and anaesthetic

The gynaecologist recommended a hysterectomy. ‘I was convinced there must be another solution. I couldn’t bear more time away from work and my family. I went home and sat at my laptop – when I found the new procedure it seemed ideal.’

The MR-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) can be done in a few hours under light sedation. Symptoms start to diminish immediately. The NHS was happy to consider funding MRgFUS for Ruth, but she couldn’t face waiting so had it privately.

After light sedation, the patient lies very still on the stomach in an MRI scanner with the fibroid directly over the ultrasound. The surgical team plot and guide the treatment from a control room using the MRI console.

‘It wasn’t the most fun four hours,’ says Ruth. ‘But I wasn’t in any pain. You have to stay completely still but the main problem is feeling chilly and a bit bored. Every now and again the ultrasound beam bounces off  the pelvis and you feel discomfort. But I had a button to press if this happened, and the second I did so they moved the beam. I went home and had an excellent night’s sleep with just a couple of painkillers.’

Two days later the bleeding had eased significantly, and continued to tail off over the following weeks.

Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Clive Spence-Jones says: ‘The science is excellent, with good clinical trials, and could be fantastic in certain situations. Though fibroids have to be on the front of the uterus with no bowel in between and can’t be too large. The procedure is likely to become popular.’

Dr Crowe adds: ‘Occasionally there may be some redness, minor pain, skin burns or bruising. These usually resolve within ten days.’

The treated fibroids will not grow back but there is a small risk of new ones growing.

‘I went in on the Thursday and was back at work on Monday,’ says Ruth. ‘My life has been changed.’
