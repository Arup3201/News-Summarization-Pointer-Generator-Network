Kiev commanders vowed to set up total blockade of the city, and also neighbouring Luhansk, another stronghold of separatists who want to be ruled by the Kremlin, forcing them to lay down their arms.

Rebels blew up three bridges on key routes into Donetsk, the country’s most important industrial hub, in a bid to prevent access for Ukraine’s armed forces which have made dramatic gains at the expense of rebels in recent days.

Small
 patrols of separatist militia were on the streets last night but 
thousands of fighters - armed with scores of anti-aircraft guns and 
armoured vehicles of Russian origin - were holed up, out of sight.

Earlier yesterday the Ukrainian army captured the eastern cities of Artemivsk and Druzhkivka from pro-Russian separatists.

Separatists
 deny they are on the point of surrender, claiming they made a tactical 
retreat and will fight to the end, a nightmare prospect for Donetsk, a 
city founded in  1869 as a mining centre in the Donbass coalfield by 
Welsh businessman John Hughes. 

Fearing
 an imminent bloody battle, many residents have left the city, and 
others were following last night while many businesses have shut down. 

Ukrainian
 National Security and Defence Council deputy head Mykhailo Koval warned
 soldiers would impose a 'full blockade' of both Donetsk and Lugansk -- 
both capitals of self-styled 'people’s republics'.

Koval vowed 'measures that will force the separatists, the bandits to lay down their arms'.

But
 with over 500 already dead in the conflict, there are fears of more 
large scale bloodshed if Ukrainian forces use their military superiority
 in Donetsk.

Ukraine’s richest oligarch, Rinat Akhmetov, based in the city and worth £6.5 billion, pleaded: 'Donetsk must not be bombed. Donbass must not be bombed. Cities, towns and infrastructure must not be destroyed.'

He urged new Kiev president Petro Poroshenko: 'We must avoid suffering and deaths of peaceful people.'

Threatened
 by harsh new Western sanctions, Vladimir Putin has so far resisted 
sending in troops he has stationed in positions close to the border. 

Separatist
 leader Denis Pushilin made an unverified claim that his men had killed 
“tens” of Ukrainian soldiers in the eastern coal mining region of 
Saur-Mogila, pledging this was a  turning point.

'After
 massacring the fascists at Saur-Mogila, I understood the words of one 
of my colleagues: we abandoned Slavyansk to take Kiev,' he boasted. 

But
 Poroshenko warned: 'My order is now in effect - tighten the ring around
 the terrorists. Continue the operation to liberate Donetsk and Luhansk 
regions.'

Recent days have seen Ukrainian forces make significant gains, retaking Slavyansk and other key towns from separatist hands. 

Three female rebel snipers surrendered, say Kiev commanders. 

But Russia yesterday accused the Ukrainians of using banned cluster munitions in eastern Ukraine. 

'This
 irresponsible policy of the Ukrainian authorities and their Western 
sponsors is only leading to new victims and the civilian population’s 
sufferings,' said a statement. 

Rebels were shelling Luhansk with Grad multiple rocket launchers, said Ukrainian media reports.

Ukraine’s
 secret service has launched an investigation into senior Vladimir Putin
 aide Sergei Glazyev, accusing him of planning 'military operations' and
 'helping terrorists'.

The adviser hit back, claiming the SBU intelligence service 'plays the same role as Gestapo did in Nazi Germany'.

At a rally in the Donetsk's central 
square yesterday, pro-Russian commander, a Muscovite using the name Igor 
Strelkov, told thousands of supporters that his men would fight for the 
city, which was 'much easier to defend than little Slaviansk'.

Businesses have closed down and 
thousands of residents are believed to have fled as the fighters fortify
 positions and buildings in the city, which they have held for the past 
few months.

But
 the government government pressed what it clearly saw as its advantage,
 announcing it had carried out an air strike against rebel fighters who 
had attacked the airport in Luhansk, another eastern city, on Sunday.

It accused separatists in the area of opening fire in populated areas under the guise of being government forces.

'They
 use flags of military paratroopers, Ukrainianian state flags and thus 
fool the population,' said military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky.

Slaviansk residents talk to Ukrainian troops on patrol in the city, which had been a rebel stronghold for months

The Defence Ministry said early this 
morning that separatists had launched 10 attacks on government posts and
 army positions in the previous 24 hours with mortars and small arms.

It
 gave no details of the incidents or casualties, but said troops had 
returned fire: 'The terrorists were given a fitting reply.'

The
 months-old conflict has already cost the lives of more than 200 
Ukrainian troops, as well as hundreds of civilians and rebel fighters.

Separatist
 rebellions erupted in mainly Russian-speaking eastern regions of 
Ukraine in April following the overthrow of a pro-Russian president in 
Kiev in February.

It 
appeared that the militants had been encouraged to take action after 
Moscow annexed the Crimea peninsula in March - leading to speculation 
that the Kremlin may have designs on other parts of the country.

Rebels
 have since then been barricaded into government buildings in Donetsk, 
which they declared capital of an independent 'people's republic', but 
Slaviansk, with 120,000 people, was their most symbolic stronghold.

Strelkov,
 the self-styled rebel defence minister, whose real name is Igor Girkin,
 was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying 80-90 per cent of his men 
had escaped from Slaviansk.

They were now organising the active defence of Donetsk.

Recapturing
 Slaviansk has given Ukrainian forces by far their clearest victory 
after months of patchy performance against the heavily-armed militants, 
many of whom are Russians who have crossed the border to fight.

Moscow denies supporting them.

Poroshenko ordered the assault on 
Slaviansk after abandoning a unilateral ceasefire last week, arguing 
that the rebels had refused to abide by the truce.

'My
 order is now in effect - tighten the ring around the terrorists,' 
Poroshenko tweeted yesterday. 'Continue the operation to liberate 
Donetsk and Luhansk regions,' he said.

He
 said the victory in Slaviansk marked the beginning of a turning point 
in the conflict, though he cautioned that rebels would now regroup and 
'further tests' lay ahead.

In Slaviansk, around 200 residents lined up in the city's central square on Sunday for meat, potatoes, onions and bread distributed by troops.

'Everything is different now. Tonight is the first night with no shelling,' said Mikhail Martynenko, 58, a guard at a local market near Slaviansk.

'People are in a better mood and there are more people on the streets. Everyone was afraid. They had no idea when another mortar would come flying.'
