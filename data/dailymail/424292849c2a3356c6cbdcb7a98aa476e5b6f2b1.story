Wherever Silvio Berlusconi goes, it seems a woman is never far away.

Now, as the 76-year-old seeks re-election as Italian Prime Minister, he has a new lady by his side.

At 27, the stunning Francesca Pascale, a member of his party, is nearly a third his age.

The relationship, which has been going
steadily for months, was confirmed by Daniela Santanche, an MP in his 
Freedom of the People party, who described it as a 'beautiful thing'.

It was also announced by the Italian press which have described Miss Pascale as Italy's new 'first lady'.

Licia Ronzulli, a Euro MP in his party, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Let's say she is a person who is very close to him. She's more than a friend.'

Miss Pascale, a former shop assistant 
from Naples, served as a provincial councillor in his centre-Right PDL 
party before stepping down in July.

A founding member of a support group 
called 'Silvio, we miss you', she has previously said the three most 
important things in her life are her family, politics and Mr Berlusconi.

It is said she is jealous of the other women in his inner circle, including Mara Carfagna, a glamour model whom he appointed equal opportunities minister during his last term as Prime Minister.

Berlusconi has been married twice and has five children. In 1965, he married Carla Elvira Dall'Oglio, and they had two children.

He later had three more children with his second wife, the actress Veronica Lario, from whom he is separated.

Over the years, Mr Berlusconi has been linked with a string of glamorous young women, including models, actors, showgirls and prostitutes who attended his notorious 'bunga bunga' sex parties at his mansions.

In July, the former Prime Minister was forced to deny allegations by a model who claimed that she was pregnant with his sixth child.

Sabina Began - who earned her nickname 'Queen Bee' for her alleged lead role in the infamous Buna Bunga parties - claimed she was expecting the controversial politician's baby but has since lost it.

The 38-year-old German model and actress told Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano i she was sure it was his child as she had 'only slept with him'.

Trials and accusations: Mr Berlusconi, now 76, 
is accused in another trial of paying to have sex with Karima El-Mahroug
in 2010 when she was 17

She later sent writers for the Italian gossip website Dagospia a text message informing them she had lost the baby overnight due to a miscarriage.

The news prompted Berlusconi’s lawyer, Niccolo Ghedini, to issue a denial.

He currently faces trial over allegations he paid Moroccan exotic dancer Karima el-Mahroug for sex when she was 17, a year under the legal age for prostitution.

Meanwhile, it has emerged that Miss el-Mahroug has turned up in Mexico after missing a court date and becoming entangled in Italy's latest political drama.

News agency ANSA reported that Miss el-Mahroug, known as Ruby, notified her attorney of her whereabouts after reading that her absence on Monday had sparked a minor uproar in court.

Attorney Paola Boccardi informed the court on Tuesday that Ruby wasn't expected back until next month, ANSA said.

Berlusconi is accused of paying Ruby, then 17, for sex during his bunga bunga parties, and using his office to cover it up. Both deny the accusations.

A verdict in the case had been expected as early as January.

Mr Berlusconi has confirmed that he will stand in next year’s election, a year after being forced to resign amid a sex scandal and a debt crisis.

A conviction right before the election would be a major blow to Berlusconi, who in October was convicted of tax fraud in a separate case involving his media holdings.

He denied the charges and is appealing the sentence, which isn't considered definitive until all three levels of appeal are exhausted.

The courtroom turmoil played out as Italy's political and financial foundations were rocked by fallout from Berlusconi's decision last week to yank his party's support for Premier Mario Monti's government, accusing Monti's austerity measures of making Italy worse off than a year ago when he was last in power.

Monti announced over the weekend that he would resign after Parliament passes the 2013 budget, forcing elections to be moved up several weeks to February.

Monti was tapped last year to replace Berlusconi, who was forced to resign after international markets lost faith in his ability to save Italy from a Greek-style debt crisis.
