Leicester City survived an impressive Walsall comeback to win their friendly 3-2, and extend a victorious run that stretches back to April

Goals from Wes Morgan and Dave Nugent appeared to put the Premier League new boys firmly in control, but Walsall fought back. Mathieu Manset, a trialist at the club, got one back just before the break and Ashley Grimes drew them level shortly after.

Dean Smith's men almost held on for a draw but a late Danny Drinkwater goal ensured Leicester won their seventh straight game in all competitions.

Leicester named a strong side that included Dave Nugent and Marc Albrighton, and it soon paid off as they took the lead within ten minutes.

Foxes captain Morgan met Albrighton's corner and his powerful header found the back of the net.

Dave Nugent then produced the moment of the match as he used the outside of his boot to guide the ball in to the top corner from distance.

After an impressive pre-season, Leicester sensed another victory but the hosts had other ideas.

Goals either side of half time from Mathieu Manset and Ashley Grimes suggested the game was heading for draw.

There was still time for one more twist, though, and it came courtesy of Drinkwater. The former Manchester United man shot from 25-yards and his effort sailed into the Walsall net.

The victory capped a brilliant few days for Nigel Pearson, whose side beat Everton earlier in the week. Leicester have now won every game since they drew with Reading in their Championship game back in April.
