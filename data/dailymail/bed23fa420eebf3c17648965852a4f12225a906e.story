A cancer sufferer has received thousands of texts and calls from JLS fans after Aston Merrygold posted his phone number on Twitter - claiming it was for his band mate Oritse Williams.

Bill Phillips, 65, started receiving texts and phone calls 'every five seconds' after the ex JLS singer announced his number to his 183,000 followers as an April Fool’s joke.

The grandfather - who is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer - has since received more than 4,700 texts and calls from fans hoping to contact Oritse.

Mr Phillips, from Hornchurch, Essex, said: 'I’ve got girls ringing up crying at 12 at night asking why did I split up from the band. Girls have been asking ‘will you marry me?’

'A joke is a joke but this is not a joke. It has made my life hell. I’m getting calls and texts at all hours, sometime one and two in the morning.

'The kid is most likely a millionaire - I’m not. I’m sure he thinks it is great - it’s not. It’s costing me money and grief.'

JLS star Aston, 26, has now phoned Mr Phillips to apologise for the joke - and offered him tickets to a show.

The star posted the grandfather's number on Twitter along with numbers he claimed belonged to other bandmates Marvin Humes and JB Gill.

The singer put three numbers on his Twitter page claiming they belonged to each of his band mates. He then wrote: 'Call them if you don't believe me'

He wrote: 'As u can all see I’ve decided to take the high road and not do any pranks on April fools day.'

He then posted the numbers with the hashtag #sorrynotsorry before encouraging fans to ring them

He wrote: 'Call them if you don’t believe me. April Fools finishes at 12 if you are 12. We goooooo all day over here.'

Mr Phillips says the messages and calls started within minutes - and are still continuing a week after the stunt.

Mr Phillips says the ‘joke’ has cost him thousands of pounds in lost jobs after he was forced to turn off the phone he uses to run two of his businesses.

The father-of-two, who runs a stadium seat installation business and is also a pest-control falconer, said: 'I’m 65 and I’m not in a boy band. I’m trying to run a couple of businesses and this is impeding it.

'I’ve had this number for 21 years and I use it for work and clients - it is not an option to change it.

'It has cost me money. I can’t get hold of my men on my mobile, I’m having to do everything from a landline which isn’t easy. I know already of one job it cost me.

'I had to turn my phone off and missed a job they wanted doing of clearing seagulls. I was first choice but they had to offer it to someone else when they couldn’t get hold of me.'

Aston Merrygold phoned Mr Phillips over the weekend to apologise for putting his phone number on Twitter.

He also took to Twitter to reassure fans the numbers he posted were fake - but still has not deleted them.

On Saturday he wrote: 'Ok so let's go back to APRIL FOOLS for a sec! Jus to make sure everyone knows Those numbers I put up were a JOKE! A joke! Uno ha ha #nottrue.'

Mr Phillips said: 'He couldn't apologise enough on the phone. His management are supposed to be contacting me to say what they are going to do about it, but I haven't heard anything yet.

'I've always liked the kids - they are good guys - and he said it was a prank. He offered me whatever I wanted - a package of tickets or whatever - but I'm more of a Michael Buble fan.

'But I'm still going to speak to my solicitor about it. It's ruined my business.'

Mr Phillips was diagnosed with prostate cancer five years ago and is due to finish treatment in October.

The international boxing referee - who represented England at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games - is also due to have an operation to completely reconstruct his knee this Friday.

Mr Phillips - who runs two businesses - says the prank has cost him money as he has had to turn off his mobile and had therefore missed offers of work. He says he will speak to his solicitor about the joke

It will be the sixth operation to repair the sporting injury.

Mr Philips added: 'This is really not what I needed. I was hoping to use the last few days to get stuff sorted for being off, but it’s been a nightmare.'

Aston Merrygold has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.

A spokesman for Essex Police confirmed the incident had been reported, but said it does not constitute as an offence.

He added: 'A man from Hornchurch, east London, attended South Ockendon police station in Essex shortly before 4pm on Tuesday April 1 to report that his mobile telephone number had been inappropriately published on Twitter.

'He was given words of advice regarding communication on Twitter.'
