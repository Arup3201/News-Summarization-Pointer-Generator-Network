Rolf Harris' victims gave agonising accounts of their abuse at the hands of the entertainer which left them unable to move on before he was jailed for five years and nine months.

As part of the sentencing process of the star, Southwark Crown Court heard Victim Impact Statements from the four women that Harris has been convicted of indecently assaulting. 

The 84-year-old listened solemn-faced as he approached the moment when he would be jailed for his crimes.

He was given a small reprieve when prosecutor Sasha Wass QC confirmed that Harris will not stand trial over 33 sexual images of children found on his computer when his home was searched.

'Haunted': Bindi's friend said Harris' actions crushed her dreams of having a career and a family

Harrowing: Harris left the best friend of his daughter Bindi feeling 'dirty, grubby and disgusting' after his abuse

In a statement read by junior prosecutor Esther Schutzer-Weissman, the former friend of his daughter Bindi said: 'The attacks that happened have made me feel dirty, grubby and disgusting.

'The whole sordid saga has traumatised me.'

She said the effects of Harris's abuse had been with her for many years, and had been the cause of a drinking habit she developed at an early age.

'As a young girl I had aspirations to have a career, settle down and have a family,' she said.

'However, as a direct result of his actions, this has never materialised.

'The knowledge of what he had done to me haunted me. However, his popularity with the British public made it harder for me to deal with.'

The statement went on: 'Rolf Harris had a hold over me that made me a quivering wreck', adding: 'He made me feel like a sexual object, he used and abused me to such a degree that it made me feel worthless.'

The woman said she had been convinced nobody would believe her, but her family had when she finally told them.

She said she had been 'dry' since 2000 but still suffered panic attacks and severe anxiety and was unable to communicate and socialise with people outside a small circle, making her world 'very small'.

She said: 'Rolf Harris, knowing what he had done to me, put me through the ordeal of appearing in court,' saying she felt he had tried to humiliate her by getting her to talk about the abuse in a public arena.

Sentence: Harris sat solemn-faced in the dock with a suitcase awaiting sentence for 12 counts of abuse

'Suffered in silence': One victim told  how she struggled to cope with the abuse as Harris 'got away with it'

'I believe he thought he could make me crumble which I used to, but I am better than I was.'

She said she had suffered abuse at the hands of someone who thought he could get away with it, but said she had 'suffered in silence' for years, causing a detrimental effect to her life.

Another victim, who was assaulted by Harris when she visited England as a teenager, said the incident was a 'turning point' in her life that she had never recovered from.

She said: 'I have never felt safe since, I life in a constant state of anxiety.'

Her statement added: 'What Mr Harris took from me was my very essence, I believe that it was for Mr Harris a forgettable moment but it was something for me I will never move on from.

'I know the person I am today is not the person I should have been.' 

Impact: One victim's statement explained how Harris 'had a hold over me' and drove her to alcoholism 

She said she became an angry and confused child, unable to express herself and unable to trust men.

'When Jimmy Savile was exposed I had the courage to tell people I felt I would be believed.

'I felt so much guilt that I had not said anything earlier, this was made worse when I read that Rolf Harris had abused others, I again blamed myself for not having the courage to say something sooner.

'I carried what Rolf Harris did to me for most of my life, it took away my childhood.'

A fourth victim who was assaulted at a celebrity event in Cambridge when she was a teenager, said Harris took advantage of her, making her feel ashamed.

She said the star 'treated me like a toy' that he could play with for his own pleasure.
