Ross County chairman Roy MacGregor confirmed on Saturday that legendary Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert has applied to become the next manager of the Highland club.

Speaking before the 4-0 defeat to Hamilton Accies which left his side very much rooted to the foot of the Premiership table, MacGregor revealed the Champions League winner is among the list of candidates to succeed Derek Adams, who was sacked earlier this week along with his director of football father, George.

‘I cannot believe the quality of applicants,’ MacGregor said.

‘We have had a really good response. That response, five years ago, would never have happened and it wouldn’t have happened two years ago.

‘The credit for putting Ross County on the map goes back to George and Derek and I’d like to thank them for that.

The calibre of applicant has been really good.’

Kluivert is a managerial rookie but the former Ajax and Barcelona striker helped Louis van Gaal for Holland in this summer’s World Cup and is keen to get involved in management in Britain.

Former St Mirren manager Danny Lennon has also been linked with the post, as has one-time Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Hibs boss Terry Butcher.

‘Terry certainly was a motivator (at Inverness), he did a wonderful job there,’ added MacGregor. ‘He has an affiliation with the Highlands.

‘An affiliation with the Highlands is really important and that they understand what our area is about.’ Meanwhile, County’s caretaker boss Steve Ferguson, who was Derek Adams’ assistant, admitted the sacking of the man who guided the Highlanders to the Scottish Cup Final in 2010 had taken its toll on the players as they were humbled by Hamilton.

After a Martin Canning header, a Mickael Antoine-Curier double and Jason Scotland’s strike had consigned his side to defeat,

Ferguson said: ‘It’s not been an easy week for anyone involved with the club and its not ended any better.

‘You have to give credit to Hamilton, they were the better team.

‘A difficult week took its toll. The players have shown me great respect in the last two days and prepared for this as well as they could.

'They all gave 100 per cent, but we got well beaten. It’s very different to replace a manager who has done as much for a club like ours. I don’t know who is coming in to replace Derek. That is up to the chairman.’

Antoine-Curier, who netted both goals from the spot, revealed he fancies his chances against any goalkeeper from 12 yards - because he gets tips from Hamilton No 1 Michael McGovern, who himself saved a penalty from Richard Brittain at 3-0.

Antoine-Curier said: ‘I practice penalties with Michael and we can take tips from each other.’
