It hardly does it justice to suggest that Michal Zyro’s last meeting with Scottish opposition was bittersweet.

The Legia Warsaw midfielder scored in both legs of his club’s thumping 6-1 aggregate victory over Celtic in the Champions League qualifiers — only for his outstanding efforts to be rendered meaningless.

It was the most painful of blows. The administrative error that saw Legia bring on the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski in place of Zyro for the final few minutes of their win at Murrayfield has entered the annals of footballing infamy.

UEFA punished the Poles by awarding Celtic a 3-0 second-leg walkover, meaning Henning Berg’s side exited the competition on the away-goals rule.

Zyro insists he is over that heartbreak but there would surely be an extra piquancy if he could now hurt Scottish hopes in the international arena.

The 22-year-old is a member of the Poland squad preparing to take on Gordon Strachan’s side in Tuesday night’s vital clash in Warsaw.

‘I have strange memories of playing Scottish opposition,’ admitted Zyro. ‘Against Celtic at the start of the season it was great on the park — but a nightmare off it. I scored in both games so, personally, it was special for me.

‘What happened in the aftermath is something I try not to think about because it was a really unfortunate situation. But we can still take heart from the fact we played two super matches and beat a team such as Celtic 6-1.

‘I won’t think about what happened going into this game. It’s a different situation — different team, different players. It’s important for Poland to beat Scotland but that is for the national team to progress and not just for me.

‘We want three points to end this round of qualifiers. I can take confidence from my performances against Celtic going into this game but football is different.

‘The Europa League is different from the Champions League and international football is different again. At the moment I was told we were out of the Champions League, I felt terrible.

‘We did everything on the pitch to go through, which is our job and the fault was in the office. It was a mistake on paper, not on grass.’

Legia have won two out of two in their Europa League section so far, but can’t escape from thoughts that they could have been mixing it with the elite.

‘I watch the Champions League on TV and it’s crazy to think we were so close and it was taken from us,’ said Zyro. ‘But I am a young player and in a year or two maybe I can perform there.

‘It’s more unfortunate for the older players such as Marek Saganowski and others who might not get that chance again. Maybe next year. I am someone who looks forward, not back.

‘One match after we were out of the Champions League I forgot about it. Maybe there was a little bit of pain in the back of the head. It was harder for the office staff and fans who worked at the club for many years and dreamed of this but, as a player, you just focus on the next match.’

That now means Scotland, with Poland still in ebullient mood in the wake of Saturday’s historic 2-0 win over Germany.

Adam Nawalka’s side have upset the order in Group D and have yet to concede a goal, having opened up with a 7-0 romp past Gibraltar.

There is, however, little sign of that flawless start producing any complacency or over-confidence. Respectful assessments of the Scottish threat have been the norm.

Zyro continued that theme but also made it clear he regards the current Poland players as the best crop their nation has produced in quite some time.

He is an example of the emerging talent. Linked with potential transfer interest from Celtic before their Champions League meeting, the midfielder is now on the radar of several clubs in the English Premier League.

‘This is an important game for us and maybe even more important than Germany because Scotland are one of our direct opponents for second and third place,’ insisted Zyro. ‘Scotland were unlucky against Germany. Thomas Muller wasn’t even looking towards goal when he scored his header.

‘Now they have recorded a good win (over Georgia), so I expect them to have a positive attitude.

‘Personally, I am a big admirer of Scottish football. The style is very strong and quick and when I played for Legia Warsaw against Celtic at Murrayfield, the atmosphere was great.

‘It will be a full house in the national stadium for the Scotland match and the atmosphere is always electric. We want to play for the people of Poland and win.

‘We have a strong team. Everyone knows of Robert Lewandowski but we have strength in other areas. We have three good goalkeepers in Wojciech Szczesny, Lukasz Fabianski and Artur Boruc

‘There is depth in the squad and we have a good balance between attack and defence. We have improved in every match and play to win the group.’
