Suspects in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann will be questioned by police in Portugal this week, it has emerged

Suspects in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann will be questioned by police in Portugal this week, it emerged last night.

Three Portuguese nationals and one Russian man will be interviewed in the Algarve region from today.

The questioning follows a formal request by British police, who will sit in on the interview, but only Portuguese officers will ask questions.

The Russian suspect lived in Praia da Luz when Madeleine disappeared.

He was previously questioned by police during the first phase of the investigation by Portuguese police after Madeleine went missing in 2007 although he was never made a suspect.

The suspects are attending ‘of their own free will’ and will be made ‘arguidos’ - people of interest - after they meet police.

Eight witnesses are also due to be questioned at a police station in Faro.

The interviews will take place over two or more days.

Last month British police were involved in fingertip searches of sites around Praia da Luz as part of the British re-investigation into her disappearance.

British officers, accompanied by their Portuguese counterparts, carried out searches earlier this month of three areas of land near to where Madeleine went missing.

The McCann’s recently said in a statement: ‘We have always wanted all reasonable lines of inquiry to be followed. It is gratifying to know that a substantial amount of work is taking place with the close co-operation of the British and Portuguese authorities.’

Their spokesman Clarence Mitchell said last night: ‘Kate and Gerry will simply not comment on any aspect of Operation Grange.

'It is entirely a matter for the Met Police as to what they do and when they will do it.’

A spokesperson for the Yard’s multi-million-pound inquiry, headed by Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, said they were moving to a new phase after negotiations with the Portuguese authorities.

They have vowed to carry out ‘a substantial amount of work’ over the coming weeks and months in their bid to find out what happened to Madeleine.

The three-old-old vanished from a holiday apartment in May 2007 while her parents were dining with pals nearby.

Former GP Kate, 46, and heart doctor Gerry, 45, from Rothley, Leics, believe their daughter, who would now be 11, could still be alive.

A source close to the couple said yesterday: ‘Kate and Gerry are pleased that police are moving onto the next phase of their investigation.

'But they know that any activity is about ruling people out of the inquiry as much as ruling them in.

‘Officers are keeping them fully informed of what is happening.’
