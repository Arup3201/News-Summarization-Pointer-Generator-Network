A swarm of lightweight probes could be sent into the atmosphere of Jupiter to return unprecedented data on the gas giant, a team of scientists has proposed.

The probes would be deployed from a larger spacecraft and would descend without parachutes for 15 minutes.

Armed with cameras, they would also return the closest pictures ever taken of Jupiter - and these probes could arrive at the planet by 2030.

Illustrated is a proposal for how the mission would work. It could launch as early as 2022, with the probes being deployed on approach to the planet. Once they hit the atmosphere they would be slowed with heat shields and return scientific data for 15 minutes before being destroyed by Jupiter's intense pressure

The proposal was put forward by Dr John Moores of the Centre for Research in the Earth and Space Sciences (Cress), at York University, Toronto and his colleagues.

Orbiting and flyby probes have provided astronomers with a lot of information about the 'surface' of the outer planets and the moons that orbit those planets.

However, probing deep within their atmospheres requires penetrating the dense clouds to obtain meaningful data.

This would not be the first time such a misison into the atmosphere of Jupiter was carried out.

In 1995 the Galileo Space Probe detached from the larger Galileo spacecraft and entered the atmosphere of Jupiter.

It survived for 57 minutes, returning data about Jupiter's atmosphere.

However, without a camera, it did not return any images from inside Jupiter's atmosphere.

Also, weighing 747lbs (339kg), the probe was fairly heavy and required a parachute in order to pass slowly through the atmosphere and return enough useful data.

Each probe, costing less than £660,000 ($1m), would weigh no more than 27.6lbs (12.5kg) and measure two feet (0.6 metres) across.

In total 60 could be taken by a spacecraft to Jupiter, and to mitigate any failures if some of the probes didn't work, scientific experiments would be spread among them.

They would be released by a larger spacecraft on approach to the planet. The 'mothership' would then be free to enter orbit and study Jupiter and its moons.  

Using smaller probes, made possible by the miniaturisation of electronics, cameras and other instruments, would allow them to survive the fall through Jupiter's atmosphere for much longer without a parachute, according to Dr Moores.

'Our concept shows that for a small enough probe, you can strip off the parachute and still get enough time in the atmosphere to take meaningful data while keeping the relay close and the data rate high,' Moores explains.

This provides more space to pack in more scientific instruments and equipment. 

Transmitting 20 megabits of data over fifteen minutes, enough for 100 images from each probe, would be sufficient to allows scientists to get a picture of a large part of the atmosphere.

And Dr Moores said a fleet of the tiny probes could launch with Esa's Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) spacecraft, which will launch in 2027 and arrive at the Jovian system in 2030.

This would not be the first time such a mission into the atmosphere of Jupiter was carried out. In 1995 the Galileo Space Probe, illustrated, detached from the larger Galileo spacecraft and entered the atmosphere of Jupiter. It survived for 57 minutes, returning data about Jupiter's atmosphere

The mission has been named Smara for Small Reconnaissance of Atmospheres and gets its name from the wind-borne fruit of the maple tree, the samara.

The Smara mission may help address various aspects of planetary science.

For instance, given that more than two-thirds of the total mass of the solar system, not including the sun, forms Jupiter, its study is important for understanding the nature of the solar nebula from which our sun and all its planets formed.

Additionally, Jupiter is under constant bombardment from small bodies, such as asteroids, and understanding its atmosphere would shed new light on the nature of these.

The planet's atmosphere may even represent a historical record of impacts, again providing information about the composition of the solar system.

Additionally, Jupiter's is the deepest of all the planetary atmospheres in the solar system and so offers an exciting laboratory for understanding flow dynamics, cloud microphysics and radiative transfer under conditions that are very different from those we see on Earth.

Also, Jupiter is the closest gas giant to Earth, and there are now known to be many more similar planets orbiting other stars.

Studying our nearest gas giant neighbour in close-up detail might allow us to understand the gas giants of distant stars with greater clarity.

The mission is only a concept for now, but the scientists will be hoping to develop it further in order to potentially hitch a ride to Jupiter in the not too distant future.

Researchers at York University in Toronto have outlined plans to send a swarm of tiny spacecraft into Jupiter's atmosphere

@highlight

The lightweight probes would not need parachutes to survive

@highlight

Instead they would descend and operate for about 15 minutes

@highlight

In that time they would return 20 Megabits of data to an orbiting spacecraft

@highlight

This would include atmospheric data and images from 'inside' Jupiter

@highlight

The probes could be sent as part of Esa's Juice mission in 2030
