Hartlepool United were forced to make a U-turn in their attempts to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans after a backlash from supporters and the town’s MP.

Fans of the Football League’s bottom club took to social media and online forums to express their displeasure at comments from new manager Ronnie Moore declaring an interest in signing the 25-year-old, who was released from prison in October after serving half of a five-year sentence for the rape of a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in 2011.

Hartlepool MP Iain Wright had been vociferous in his opposition to the move, but he has now welcomed the decision to back down.

Hartlepool MP Iain Wright had been critical of moves to bring the striker in, and praised the U-turn

‘I think it would have been a terrible move for the club and I think it would have split the fans,’ he said.

‘There would have been people who stayed away from the club and the sponsors wouldn’t have wanted to be associated with a convicted rapist and would have pulled out, and that could have compromised the survival of the club.’ 

Hartlepool’s statement, meanwhile, still mentioned the value of Evans as a player. It read: ‘Following media reports relating to the possible signing of Ched Evans the club wishes to make its position clear.

‘Hartlepool United do not intend signing Ched Evans and, for the avoidance of doubt, will not be doing so, irrespective of his obvious ability as a football player. 

Ronnie Moore believes Evans could help Hartlepool United if he were to sign for the club

‘This story has emerged following an unsubstantiated internet rumour which the manager was asked to comment upon. The manager responded hypothetically to the situation by stating “if it could happen I would want it to happen”. 

'This response was based upon the player’s obvious ability as a footballer and as such as then been headlined by the media without asking the club for their official position.

‘The club can fully understand the concerns of supporters and the general public and regrets any misconception portrayed.

‘After a highly positive week at Hartlepool United following the takeover by new owners and the appointment of a new manager, the owners are saddened by this unfortunate turn of events and wish to draw a line under it immediately.’
