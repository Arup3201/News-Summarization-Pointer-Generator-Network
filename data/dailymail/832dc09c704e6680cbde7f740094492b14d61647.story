The video on demand revolution is heating up in Australia with Foxtel's streaming service launching last week and Netflix due to kick off in March.

But the big question still remains unanswered...

Netflix won't confirm if season three of the award-winning House Of Cards will air when it launches its Australian branch in March

Netflix Australia won't confirm if the two popular shows will be available and it's believed to be because of licensing agreements already in place with pay TV operator Foxtel.

They are reportedly now scrambling for deals to try and salvage the rights from Foxtel. 

The new trailer for House Of Cards has been released advertising that season three will air via Netflix in the United States from February 27.

But when the Australian branch Netflix launches on its rumoured March 31 date, the show will already be a month behind.

Netflix's popular Orange Is The New Black is also in murky waters due to licensing agreements already in place with pay TV operator Foxtel

Lena Dunham's Girls is also available on Presto with packages priced at $9.99 per month

Shows Netflix will have on offer when it launches in Australia include Marco Polo, Bojack Horseman and a Chelsea Handler comedy. 

It comes as Presto TV - Foxtel's joint subscription streaming service with the Seven Network - launched on Sunday.

But some of the more popular shows still in production only have a few seasons available on Presto. 

Dexter will also be available on Presto after announcing they had deals to run TV shows and movies from major US studios HBO and Showtime

Stan also has the rights for Breaking Bad and the exclusive Australian rights for its prequel Better Call Saul

Streaming service Stan - a joint venture between Fairfax and Nine Entertainment - still doesn't have a launch date but they've announced they will have the rights to Transparent

The company says it doesn't have the rights to current seasons for particular shows like Girls and The Good Wife, but will eventually have access to the complete series.

The third streaming service called Stan - a joint venture between Fairfax and Nine Entertainment - still doesn't have a launch date.

They've already announced the exclusive Australian rights for Breaking Bad prequel Better Call Saul and secured distribution rights for the Transparent and Fargo series.

Stan is marketing its TV and movie streaming service at $10 per month.
