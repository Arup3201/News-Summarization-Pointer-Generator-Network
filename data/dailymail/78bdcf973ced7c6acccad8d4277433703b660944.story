Arrest: Kristen Smith has been charged with kidnapping her nephew

A Colorado woman has been accused of faking a pregnancy then kidnapping her six-day-old nephew from his home in Beloit, Wisconsin.

Kristen Smith, 31, has been charged with kidnap after police found a prosthetic pregnancy belly and baby clothes in the back of her car.

The 31-year-old from Denver also allegedly gave police a hand drawn map that led them to baby Kayden Powell, who had been taken from his home in the early hours of Thursday.

Kayden was found wrapped in blankets and placed in a tote bag near an Iowa gas station at 10.15am on Friday. He was cold but in good health.

The baby was found near to where police had stopped Smith, after Kayden's mother Brianna Marshall, reported him missing.

Smith had been staying with Miss Marshall, 18, just before Kayden was snatched from his bed while his parents slept.

When police searched her cell phone records and Facebook account, they found messages from Smith claiming that she had given birth on Wednesday.

Her phone reportedly contained an 
e-mail where she said she gave birth to a baby on Wednesday, despite the
 fact she did not appear pregnant and was not pregnant while in 
Wisconsin.

The complaint, seen by the Chicago Tribune, said a prosthetic pregnancy belly was 
found inside Smith's car. She allegedly had posted on her Facebook 
page that she was pregnant.

The complaint also stated that after 
Kayden was found, Smith admitted to taking the infant and to leaving him 
at the gas station where he was found.

A spokeswoman for University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics said Kayden was in good condition and had been discharged from hospital Friday evening.

Hospital spokeswoman Jennifer Brown said the baby had been reunited with his parents who were taking him back to Wisconsin.

West Branch Police Chief Mike Horihan described the case to ABC7 as 'unique'.

'I have been in law enforcement for a while and nothing ever surprises me. But it's very unique and very special and I'm just glad everything seems to be fine,' he said.

FBI acting special agent GB Jones said at a news conference that Beloit police chief Steven Kopp heard the infant crying and discovered the child swaddled in blankets and placed in a tote bag outside a gas station.
