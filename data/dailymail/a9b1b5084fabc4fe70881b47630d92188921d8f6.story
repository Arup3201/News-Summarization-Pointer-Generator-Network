A 21-year-old student died after losing control of her car in the early hours of New Year's Day and crashing into a frozen Wisconsin river.

Ellen Marie Ahmann's body was found in her submerged car after a bus driver called police to report tire tracks leading off the road and on to the ice, where a large hole had appeared.

Divers and underwater cameras were used to locate the car, which was submerged in more than 6ft of icy water in Swift Creek.

Crash: Student Ellen Marie Ahmann died on New Year's Day after her car plunged into an icy river

Recovery: Emergency crews worked for 12 hours to bring the submerged car to the surface

Miss Ahmann, known as Ellie to her friends, was studying finance at Winona State University and worked part time in a bar.

She had been on her way back from working New Year's Eve when she failed to make a curve in the road, resulting in her car going down a 40ft embankment and on to the ice.

It is not known what time Miss Ahmann crashed into the river, but her shift at the bar ended at about 10.30pm and when emergency crews arrived at the river after 1.30am she had already died.

It took 12 hours for emergency crews to remove her car from the river. Miss Ahmann was the sole occupant in the vehicle, ABC 19 reported.

An autopsy is due to take place on Friday, which will determine if alcohol or drugs were a factor in the crash.

The victim's mother, Barb Ahmann, told LaCrosse Tribune that her daughter had been due to graduate in the spring and had just started an internship in accounting.

'She was so loved and one of those young people who really wanted to make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives,' she said.

Miss
 Ahmann, who moved to Winona from Minnesota so she could attend 
university, had spent the holidays with her family, including her three 
brothers.

'Full of promise: ': Ellen had been due to graduate in spring and begin a career in finance

Her university released a statement saying: 'Our WSU community mourns the loss of student Marie Ellen "Ellie" Ahmann, who died New Year's Eve in a car accident.'

The student's professor, Don Salyards, said Miss Ahmann was ambitious and knew what she wanted from life.

'She was a girl who had goals set,' he told Winona Daily News. 'It's horrible. She was a good gal. She had all that potential and promise.'
