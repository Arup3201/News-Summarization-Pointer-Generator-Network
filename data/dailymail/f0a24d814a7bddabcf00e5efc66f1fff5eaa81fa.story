Calum Chambers' £12million transfer to Arsenal suggests all is not lost when it comes to the production line of young English talent.

The 19-year-old is already being tipped for a full call-up when international football resumes later this summer.

Chambers' former Southampton team-mate Luke Shaw won his first England caps towards the end of last season and a £30m move to Manchester United duly followed.

But what about the next generation of English players set for stardom?

Here, Sportsmail devises an XI of youngsters – headed by Chambers – who we believe could make a mark on the Premier League and international scene in the coming years...

Goalkeeper: Daniel Bentley (Southend)

Just turned 21, Bentley is yet to be recognised with any sort of international honour despite making more than 60 league appearances for Southend.

Big things to come: Southend keeper Daniel Bentley has experience beyond his years

Perhaps his residence in the lower 
leagues is the reason for that, but this agile yet imposing goalkeeper – 
he's 6ft 4in – is set for bigger things and has more senior experience 
than any young English stopper of his age.

Right back: Calum Chambers (Arsenal)

His £12million move to Arsenal this week has already triggered talk of him maturing into a future England captain, especially with Arsene Wenger keen to convert him into a centre back.

Top young Gun: Chambers is hugely regarded by Arsene Wenger and could be a future England captain

Still only 19 and with just 23 
first-team appearances for Southampton, the Gunners are nonetheless 
convinced he is a star of the future and their judgement on former 
Saints graduates Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has proved 
sound in the past.

Centre back: Jamaal Lascelles (Nottingham Forest)

The 20-year-old has shot to prominence this summer - £5m bids from Premier League clubs have a tendency to generate such fuss – but it is not without good reason.

Without weakness: For a 20-year-old, Forest's Jamaal Lascelles has a remarkably well-rounded game

Lascelles is a class act; watch him play and you cannot identify a weakness.

Forest
 are determined to keep him at the City Ground and that could well prove
 the best setting for his development under former England Under 21 boss
 Stuart Pearce.

Centre back: Brendan Galloway (MK Dons)

When a player makes their senior debut at 15 years old then he must have a bit about him.

Classy and versatile: Defender-midfielder Brendon Galloway made his senior debut at just 15 years old

And in the case of Galloway – a classy defender-cum-midfielder in the mould of Rio Ferdinand – that is certainly true.

Premier League clubs – Everton chief among them – are circling and a £4million price tag has been slapped on the 18-year-old.

Left back: Matt Targett (Southampton)

It's perhaps folly to assume that Targett will follow in the stud marks on Gareth Bale and Luke Shaw, but Southampton's production line is showing no signs of winding up just yet.

And, in the form of 18-year-old left-back Targett, they have another talented teen ready to grace the senior stage this season.

Centre midfield: Lewis Baker (Chelsea)

Chelsea's young player of the year was prolific from midfield last season, scoring 17 times for the Under 21s.

Jose Mourinho says he will take the blame should Baker not go on to earn full international honours, and that suggests elevation to the first-team could well be on the agenda.

The England Under 19 schemer is a deadball specialist and is comfortable on either foot.

Centre midfield: Will Hughes (Derby)

Having only turned 19 in April, Hughes's experience for a player of such tender years is remarkable and he is now just 11 outings shy of his 100th at club level.

He has seemingly decided the best place to add to that experience is at Derby, as he signed a new four-year deal this summer.

He can pass, dribble, score, create and gets about the park; he may be in the Championship this season but the Premier League surely awaits.

Hard to keep: Will Hughes signed a four-year deal with Derby but a Premier League move is likely

Right wing: Patrick Roberts (Fulham)

Fulham's relegation could well prove a blessing for the diminutive forward who, at 5ft 5in and with a liking for a mesmerising dribble, has been likened to Lionel Messi.

He scored twice during England Under 17s' European Championship success this summer and has seven from 14 international appearances.

Fulham
 boss Felix Magath has described the 17-year-old as 'an extraordinary 
talent' and the club are said to have put a £15m price tag on his 
head to ward off interest from Manchester United among others.

Left wing: Jordon Ibe (Liverpool)

The secret was out when the explosive winger debuted for Wycombe at 15 and Liverpool made certain they were the club to secure the teen talent.

He has progressed to the fringe of the senior side at Anfield and assisted in both goals during their 2-1 win at Preston earlier this month.

Obvious comparison with Raheem Sterling has been drawn, but you wouldn't bet against the 18-year-old enjoying a breakthrough campaign in much the same fashion as his team-mate did last time around.

Striker: James Wilson (Manchester United)

'James Wilson scores goals,' his former schoolteacher told Sportsmail last year.

The 18-year-old duly debuted for United against Hull City and bagged a brace in a 3-1 win.

Then caretaker boss Ryan Giggs had charted his progress through the academy and wasted no time in handing him a senior start. He may have to be a little more patient under Louis van Gaal, but goals are his game and, to that end, age is an irrelevance.

Boy wonder: James Wilson scored a double on his Manchester United debut last season

Striker: Adam Armstrong (Newcastle)

Devastatingly quick, the Geordie frontman was part of the England Under 17 squad which triumphed at the Euros in Malta this summer.

Alan Pardew has already given him a taste of senior action and the Toon Army like what they see, quickly conducting a terrace chant for one of their own.

More first-team exposure beckons and, with United short on out-and-out attacking options, a couple of early-season strikes could well see him win an extended stay in the side.
