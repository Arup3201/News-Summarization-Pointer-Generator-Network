A U.S. Army captain has been relieved
of his command because of sexually explicit emails he exchanged with a 
former school superintendent.

Military bosses are investigating the conduct of Captain John Hintz, 42, in particular whether he sent any emails to Nancy Sebring, 57, from his military account.

The father-of-two had been leading the U.S. Army's recruiting efforts in the Des Moines, Iowa, area.

Army spokesman John Largent said this 
type of conduct does not uphold military values, but he declined to 
comment on the details of the investigation.

'The U.S. Army takes all of the 
allegations seriously. That's why the investigation is going on, to look
into details and to find out what the exact truth is about everything,'
Mr Largent told the Des Moines Register.

Mrs Sebring abruptly resigned from 
the Des Moines district on May 10. She was to start as the 
superintendent in Omaha, Nebraska, on July 1.

But she resigned from that position in
early June, six weeks after accepting the job and after reports of the 
email exchanges appeared in The Des Moines Register and the Omaha 
World-Herald.

Last month, Captain Hintz and Mrs 
Sebring sought unsuccessfully to block the release of more emails that 
identified him as her lover.

Captain Hintz, who is married with two
children, said in a written statement to the court that if his identity
were made public, it would be devastating to his personal and 
professional lives.

He exchanged a number of emails with 
Mrs Sebring in April and May discussing their six-week affair. He is 
married with two children. Mrs Sebring is married, but has been 
separated from her husband, who lives in Colorado.

Mrs Sebring and Captain Hintz first 
met through his work as a recruiter. The initial emails they exchanged 
related to a school fitness event that he helped organise.

Captain Hintz also spoke at Des Moines
schools during at least two assemblies since he became the area's top 
recruiter in January.

He has served in the Army for 14 years
and has a distinguished record, receiving the Army Commendation Medal 
with special recognition for valour, the General MacArthur Leadership 
Award and three Purple Hearts.

His unit, part of the 101st Airborne 
Division, was featured on CBS show 60 Minutes during combat in 
Afghanistan two years ago. The mountain outpost Captain Hintz commanded 
was shelled heavily by insurgents.

Stephen Kelly, a Massachusetts lawyer
who defends members of the military, said his career could be in 
trouble if a reprimand is added to his permanent record. He said such an
action can kill an officer's career, because they are supposed to set 
examples of good behaviour.

Mrs Sebring and Captain Hintz exchanged their emails between March 26 and May 8. More than a quarter were sexually explicit. 

The school official made reference to sex acts and nude photos in the messages.

District officials read the emails which were sent between the couple using a school laptop and iPad.

President of the school board Teree Caldwell-Johnson told the Des Moines Register she was 'sorely disappointed'. 

In
one email, Mrs Sebring told her lover that she looked at a naked 
picture of him during the day 'which gets my heart racing a bit'.

In
the illicit notes she writes: 'I'm filled with nervous energy, which I 
attribute to being consumed with the desire to put my body next to yours
with nothing but your tattoos between us and [blank] until we have 
nothing left to give.'

In another email, she calls the man 'an amazing gift' whom she will 'treasure'.

She
continues in a longer passage: 'I've become addicted to everything 
about your smile, your crazy colorful body, your kisses, your [blank]!

'Of
course I don't want you to think that sex is all I think about when it 
comes to you. In fact, I have been thinking that some ''vertical'' time 
together would be very nice.'

Senior role: Mrs Sebring was found to have been sending explicit emails while working as schools superintendent in Des Moines

In
another exchange from April 2, Mrs Sebring wrote: 'Have I told you what
an incredible sexy man you are? Right now I am thinking about every 
inch of your body (including your [blank]).'

The
school district does not allow the use of work email for personal 
exchanges. Sending messages of a sexual nature is also banned.

Mrs
Sebring sent some the emails, which often rambled on for pages, while 
she was at work while others were sent in the middle of the night.

The 57-year-old, who earned $206,178 a year, told the school board she had made mistakes and that she was sorry.

She
said the affair had lasted about a month. She was due to leave her 
position on June 30 but came to an agreement with the school board that 
she would terminate her contract early.

Spokesman  Phil Roeder told the Register: 'We don’t spy on our employees. Without a public records request, this would never have come to light.'
