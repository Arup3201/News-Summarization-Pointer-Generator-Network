The discovery of a human foot in a rubber-soled shoe washed up on the Canadian coast near Vancouver has deepened a four-year mystery.

DNA testing is under way but police are at a loss to explain how it got there.

The macabre find brings to a dozen the number of human feet – all in rubber soled shoes – which have been discovered since August 2007.

The first foot was later linked to a man whose name police withheld at the request of his family.

Grim discovery: Police in Vancouver investigate after a human foot inside a running shoe washed ashore

It has been suggested that the feet, 
which are both male and female, could be from victims of the Asian 
tsunami in 2004, or even be the work of a serial killer.

What seemed initially like a bizarre coincidence has over the years become the subject of a major investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and British Columbia's coroner's office.

Nobody, however, has been able to offer a definite explanation as to what is happening - or identify who all of the feet belong to.

The latest limb to be found was discovered floating in the water along the shore of Vancouver's False Creek, which wraps around the downtown area.

Part of leg bone was still attached, police said.

Detectives cordoned off the area and the British Columbia coroner was called in.

Vancouver police spokeswoman constable Jana McGuiness said there was no indication how the remains got there and further forensic examination will be required.

'It was quite disturbing - quite a discovery to make,’ she added.

Mystery: No one has been able to offer a definitive explanation as to where the feet are coming from - or who they belong to

According to reports in the Canadian press, the discoveries date back to August 2007 when a man's foot was found on Jedediah Island, northeast of Nanaimo in British Colombia.

The foot was later linked to a deceased male whose name police withheld at the request of his family.

Over the next four years they have turned up with occasional regularity, always clad in a rubber soled shoe.

During one 11 month period six feet washed up, although it has been six months since the latest discovery.

Initially it was thought that all the feet had come from four men who died in a light aircraft crash off the West coast of Canada in February 2005.

However in August 2006 the theory fell apart with the discovery of a fifth right foot, meaning that something else was to blame.

Since then a number of explanations have been put forward - some suggested the limbs might be from stowaways who smuggled themselves onto a container ship as it left Vancouver.

Others claimed the feet could be from victims of the Asian Tsunami in 2004, or part of a human trafficking ring.

But when it emerged that one had apparently been deliberately severed, rumours began spreading that a serial killer with a twisted calling card might be at work.

Detectives frantically combed the missing person’s database for clues but later said they believed the the feet appeared to have come off the bodies naturally, and that foul play was not suspected.

Men and women are among those whose feet have come ashore, but as yet only the one male has been positively identified - with no explanation as to how they got there.

Complicating matters were claims by oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer who has said that the feet could have drifted as far as 1,000 miles.

Pranksters have also made the investigation more difficult. In 2008 they planted a hoax ‘foot’ on Vancouver Island which renewed interest in the case.
