In 1981, Bucks Fizz could not have been happier as they triumphed in the Eurovision Song Contest with Making Your Mind Up and their iconic skirt-ripping routine.

Fast forward 30 years and relations between the four members are decidedly colder.

Yesterday three of them, Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston, sat in the austere surroundings  of a hearings room at the Intellectual Property Office in London, which rules on copyright and trademark issues.

Decade-long battle: Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston arrive at the Trade Mark Registry in London. They currently perform under the name The Original Bucks Fizz

It is a far cry from the glitzy world of Top Of The Pops they once inhabited.

They were there for a legal battle with the fourth member of the original line-up, Bobby G, over the right to use the name.

The two camps are no longer on 
speaking terms. Yesterday Bobby G appeared via video link from 150 miles
away in Newport, South Wales, as it was closer to his Devon home.

Line-up: Three of the original Bucks Fizz, Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston, arrive at the Trademark Registry offices. The case will be decided towards the end of next month

Bobby G – real name Robert Gubby – 
has continued to perform under the name Bucks Fizz with new members ever
since the last of the other originals left 14 years ago.

Determined: Bobby G, real name Robert Gubby, believes he has the right to the Bucks Fizz trademark and is fighting his former bandmates

His wife Heidi Manton, who has been 
in the group for 18 years, owns the trademark.

Singers Tammy Choat and 
Paul Fordham complete the line-up.

But Cheryl, 57, Mike, 56, and Jay, 
49, who have been reunited as a trio since 2009, want to call themselves
The Original Bucks Fizz and trademark that name.

Bobby G, 53, objected, saying it infringed his trademark, so Cheryl, Mike and Jay are now asking for it to be revoked.

Yesterday the trio’s solicitor Dean Dunham said the use of the name Bucks Fizz by Bobby G ‘misleads’ the public.

The Original Bucks Fizz’s manager 
David Hahn has received emails and phone calls from disappointed fans 
who had booked tickets for Bobby G’s band expecting to see the original 
members, the hearing was told.

Some fans are said to have asked ‘Where’s
Cheryl?’ when they bought tickets to see Bobby G’s group.

Mr Dunham also gave examples of adverts for Bobby G’s act which used a photo of the original band.

He said: ‘The public perception of the words Bucks Fizz is simply the band that consisted of my three clients as well.’

The name Bucks Fizz was originally registered by the Big Note Music, the company the band was first signed to.

In 1990 the trademark expired.

Bobby G’s side registered it in 2001 after a legal dispute with Mike Nolan.

Mr Dunham said Mr Nolan signed an 
agreement not to contest the registration but at the time had not fully 
recovered from injuries he suffered in a 1984 coach crash which left him
in a coma.

Bobby G claims only his  version of the group has a ‘direct connection’ to the original, as it had been operating continuously.

Speaking after the hearing Cheryl said she had not seen Bobby G for five years.

She added: ‘It’s really sad that it’s come to this.

‘We do proper theatre shows and we’re on TV. It’s actually the proper Bucks Fizz that you’re seeing now.’

The IPO’s decision is expected in five weeks.

Iconic: The band's skirt-ripping routine was voted the most memorable Eurovision moment ever
