A ten-year-old French boy has died and three other children were injured after getting badly burned while playing with fireworks.

One of the wounded youths, aged nine, was in critical condition and two others - the dead boy's twin and an 11-year-old friend - had burns on up to 20 per cent of their bodies, police said.

The boys were discovered in a vacant lot in the northern city of Tourcoing, near the Belgian border, with a canister of flammable material, firecrackers and fireworks.

Officials in France said there was no doubt they had been burned by accident - in a residential area to the north of the town - and there was no suspicion of criminal activity.

One of the theories is that the children were trying to build something, possibly a rocket.

Neighbours in nearby Jacques Cartier Street were alerted by shouting at around 9pm yesterday and immediately called for assistance.

The boy who died - named Thomas - was taken to a hospital in Belgium with serious burns, along with the others.

He died this morning at 11.15.

A witness said: 'It was about 8.30pm when we were alerted to the cries of the children.

'We are used to hearing them play and scream every night but this sounded different.

'At the scene, I saw two boys who had been burned, running around, crying.

'And then I saw the body of Thomas, the son of my close neighbors. He was lying on the ground, burned from head to toe. His mother was leaning over him in tears.'

The four boys had been transported by helicopter to hospitals in Brussels and Ghent.

A 20-year-old who tried to help the children also suffered from burns.

Police have now launched an investigation into the tragedy.
