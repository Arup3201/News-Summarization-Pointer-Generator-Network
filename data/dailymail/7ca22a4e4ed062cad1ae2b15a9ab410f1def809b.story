They say two heads are better than one - but this horse seems to be taking the phrase quite literally!

Photographer Geoffrey Baker, 57, was stunned when he checked out a snap he'd taken of a wild pony - but discovered it appeared to have grown a second head.

Bird watcher Geoffrey, from Port Talbot, South Wales, had taken out his camera to capture rare birds on film.

But after an unsuccessful day's twitching with a friend, Geoffrey turned his attentions to the ponies nearby.

And more through luck than any design, he managed to capture he exact moment when one of the ponies turned, creating the striking optical illusion of a horse with two heads.

It was not until Geoffrey looked at his camera's display that he realised how his split-second timing had caught the amazing image.

He said: 'A friend had bought a two-man folding chair hide and he asked if I wanted to test it out with him, in an area of gorse up on the hill called 'Cefn Bryn' overlooking the beautiful Three Cliffs bay on the Gower Peninsular.

'I got up at 5am and we sat for hours waiting for some birds but only one landed all morning.

'We noticed some wild ponies in the distance so I put my 1.7x converter on my Nikon D3 and 200-400mm lens and took some shots.

'I saw one pony coming out from behind a bush so I waited and when it turned its head to look at us, I instinctively pressed the shutter button.

'When I then looked at it on my camera's LCD screen to check exposure, I noticed that there were in fact two horses side by side.

'I think my photo of a two-headed horse turned out to be better than any I could have taken of birds!'

The optical illusion is created when the distance between the two horses is foreshortened by the telephoto lens used by Geoffrey.

Over long distances, this effect causes the two subjects to appear much much closer than they really are.
