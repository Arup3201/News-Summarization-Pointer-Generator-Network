A new visa deal proposed by the federal government could allow more Australians to live and work in the UK if a 'discriminatory' British immigration policy can be reversed.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott was tipped to mention the visa deal proposition during a visit to London on Wednesday, News Corp reports.

Government officials from both sides say work is being done to organise a compromise work visa to counter European Union laws that have capped the number of people living in the UK from outside the EU.

The number of Australians heading to the UK for work has dropped about 50 percent in the past two years following the policy changes.

The migration restrictions were introduced because the number of EU citizens working in the UK can't be stopped, so no more than 20,000 skilled workers from elsewhere in the world can take up residency.

A draft plan to  allow Australians into the UK as an exception is expected to be completed and reviewed before the end of the year.

Mr Abbott has raised the visa issue with London Mayor Boris Johnson who believes the current system is discriminatory against Australians.

Mr Johnson is believed to be lobbying British Prime Minister David Cameron to allow Australians to be placed in a different migration category.

But the British Government has raised the issue that if it allows Australians to be considered separately, they would be forced to make exceptions for other counties in the Commonwealth.

Australia has argued it should have special consideration given its status and relationship with the UK.
