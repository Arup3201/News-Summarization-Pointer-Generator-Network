David Beckham was involved in a car accident this morning after picking up his son Brooklyn from Arsenal’s training ground.

The former England captain walked away from the incident, which involved one other vehicle.

Arsenal staff ushered onlookers away from the scene and Beckham was driven away in another car, with his original vehicle unable to be used.

Beckham, 39, had been at the Arsenal training centre at London Colney, Hertfordshire, watching his eldest son Brooklyn play for the club’s under-16 side against Brighton.

One Brighton youngster, Archie Davies, tweeted: ‘Just seen David Beckham looks like he got in a car crash and hurt his shoulder.’ The teenager then added: ‘Star struck by seeing David Beckham tbh.’

And team-mate Thomas Cadman thought the whole episode was utterly surreal, tweeting: ‘Weird to play against Brooklyn Beckham earlier. Even weirder to be currently stuck behind David Beckham as he has crashed his car.’

Brooklyn was signed by Arsenal on a short-term contract earlier this month after impressing coaches at The Emirates. 

Beckham’s former club Manchester United and Chelsea had also been pursuing the talented teenager.

Brooklyn’s brother Romeo, 12, has also been playing for the club’s under-13s, while youngest son Cruz, nine, has been representing the club’s under-10s.
