On the eve of the tenth regular season game on these shores, the NFL continues to aggressively export its product.

And it is an Englishman, Mark Waller, at the heart of the sport’s international growth. 

Waller, the NFL’s executive vice president international, says the process is nearing critical mass.

‘I always said when we started this in 2007 that I felt that this was a 15-year project to assess seriously and robustly what we could accomplish in that marketplace. And I feel we’re half way down that path.’

As the Detroit Lions prepare to tackle the Atlanta Falcons at the national stadium on Sunday, it seems no longer a question of if London gets a franchise, but when. 

But Los Angeles has been crying out for a team since losing the Rams to St Louis in 1995. Alongside the Oakland Raiders and the San Diego Chargers, they are one of three clubs on year-to-year leases.

And then there are the Jacksonville Jaguars, owned by Fulham supremo Shahid Khan, who embark upon the second 'home' game of their four-year deal at Wembley against the Dallas Cowboys next month. 

The speculation and intrigue is intense. But Waller dismisses claims of a master plan.

‘One thing we’ve always tried to avoid is determining an outcome and then trying to manage to that. As long as you keep growing the fanbase and you keep showing the level of fan support, then you’ll get to the right answer, whether that’s putting a team there, playing a season of games across multiple teams or two teams. I don’t think we have a pre-conceived view.

‘I do know that the conversation of putting a team In England is much more real than it was seven years ago.’

There are no plans to make the jump from three to four games next season, with the Rugby World Cup - which sees Wembley host two games in late September - a major factor.

‘That impacts for us, particularly on Wembley availability and making sure that there’s a playing surface that works well for Rugby World Cup level as well for us and for England soccer.

‘So I think we will end up with a three-game schedule again. The difference I think will be that we will look to play two of those games back-to-back.’  

The likes of the Seattle Seahawks, the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers have enormous fan bases and the chances of them giving up a home game to travel across the pond appear slim.

‘Nothing is ever impossible, but the more passionate and loyal and strong your market is and your home field advantage is the more reluctant you are to give it up,' Waller says.

‘I’ll be honest as well, there are a whole number of teams whose leases don’t allow them to give up a home game. If you think back to the development of stadiums in this country and I think probably in the UK, a lot of those stadiums were publicly funded as well as privately funded. 

‘And as part of the public funding was a commitment in the leases that the games that would be played would be played in those stadiums.

‘There are definitely a range of clubs for whom their current lease would not allow them to play a game outside of their home stadium.’

With three sell-out games this season, the NFL has never been more popular across the pond. But would players find it an attractive proposition? Waller brushes off logistical concerns and the 50 per cent tax levy on foreign athletes, two often-touted stumbling blocks.

‘Every time you do something for the first time you’re going to encounter a number of issues, some of them real, some of them imaginary. Even within the US the tax rate is different in different states. We’ve crossed that a little in the US quite successfully. We don’t have any issues there – players choose to play where they play. And again as we do the thinking on the UK market and if we can put a team there, all those things need to be factored in.

‘The travel time, where their families would live, the cost of living, all of those will be part of the thinking we need to do if we’re going to get to a solution that works. We’re going to solve those issues.’ 

And once the London plan is in place, will the NFL explore new markets to continue its global growth?

‘We’ve been very clear that our focus is always "let’s get the UK strategy up and running", and when we feel good about where we are and what the next steps are we’ll look at the next market. And Germany is an obvious next market,' Waller explains.

‘I definitely want to look at Brazil. The stadium work they’ve done is obviously very impressive. The infrastructure exists. It has the logistical benefit of being on the same timezone as the US. And so it solves a lot of the practical issues if we were able to play games there. 

'It’s a long flight, which will obviously be considered as well, but having seen it for the World Cup, we would be foolish not to look at it.’ 

Will the NFL be flying down to Rio as part its continued commitment to grow the game across the globe?
