Two footballers have been charged with fraud as part of an ongoing police investigation into alleged match fixing.

Michael Boateng and Hakeem Adelakun, both 22, were among seven members of an alleged betting syndicate arrested on suspicion of fixing games last month.

They are accused of conspiring to defraud bookmakers by placing bets and then influencing the outcome of football matches.

The pair, who both play for Brighton-based Conference South team Whitehawk FC, were charged with conspiracy to defraud contrary to common law, the National Crime Agency confirmed today.

Boateng, a defender who joined Whitehawk in the summer following spells with Newport County, Bristol Rovers and Sutton United, and Adelakun, who has previously played for Crystal Palace and Carshalton, were both bailed.

They will appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court next week.

An NCA spokesman said: 'The Crown Prosecution Serviceâ€™s Organised Crime Division found sufficient evidence and was satisfied it was in the public interest to authorise charges.'

Boateng and Adelakun are the third and fourth men to be charged with the same offence following their arrests last week.

Chann Sankaran, 33, and Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan, 43, appeared at Cannock Magistrates' Court and were remanded in custody.

Three other men have been bailed pending further enquiries.

The group were initially arrested following an investigation by the Telegraph newspaper.

The maximum sentence the men could face is 10 years in prison.
