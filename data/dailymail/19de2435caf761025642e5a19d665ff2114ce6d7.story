A British grandmother sentenced to death by firing squad for smuggling cocaine into Bali has lost her High Court battle to force the UK Government to help her appeal.

Lindsay Sandiford, 56, was accused by the court of damaging the
image of Bali and received the sentence despite prosecutors asking for only a 15-year jail term.

Her family took legal action after the UK Foreign Office refused to help pay for 'an adequate lawyer' so she can launch an appeal.

Running out of time: Lindsay Sandiford with her sister Hilary Parsons who says she fears her sister will be executed because she has run out of money for a legal challenge

But two judges sitting in London dismissed the case today.

Mrs Justice Gloster, sitting with Mrs
Justice Nicola Davies, said the court understood 'the deep concerns of 
Mrs Sandiford and her family about Mrs Sandiford's predicament' but her 
case must be dismissed for reasons to be given on Monday next week.

The High Court was told that a notice
of appeal was filed with Indonesian officials earlier this week and she
was given a 14-day deadline to file grounds of appeal.

Aidan O'Neill QC said Sandiford was 
urgently in need of funding because she is without legal assistance and 
her family have exhausted all of their available resources.

Her sister Hilary Parsons is terrified that Sandiford, who is locked up in Bali's notorious Kerobokan Prison, will run out of time to launch an appeal against her death sentence, which must be filed by February 12.

But
with the family's finances dried up, the search for a top lawyer who 
will take on Mrs Sandiford's appeal for little or no payment has so far 
defied the desperate efforts of Mrs Parsons.

'Unless I can get someone to help, I fear the worst for Lindsay,' she said as she arrived at the gates of the prison on her daily visit. 'With no appeal launched the death sentence moves along.'

And she has told the legal rights charity Reprieve: 'I can't imagine what we will do if we miss the opportunity to save Lindsay's life.'

Staying in a cheap hotel in Bali, Mrs Parsons cannot even afford to pay the travelling expenses of an Indonesian lawyer who has offered to take on the case for no payment.

Neither Mrs Sandiford nor or sister have any hope of raising money by selling their story as British laws prevent convicted people and their families from benefiting financially from their crimes.

Mrs Parsons admits she is in a 'terrifying position' as she struggles to find ways to help her sister when she does not speak Indonesian and has not found any assistance in understanding how the country's criminal justice system works.

The two women have turned to the British government for help – if for nothing more than to cover the costs of a lawyer who will act for Mrs Sandiford for no fee.

Caught: Sandiford was arrested at Bali's international airport with 10.6lb of cocaine in her possession

Death sentence: The court told the grandmother she had shamed Bali's tourism reputation by smuggling cocaine in the lining of her suitcase through the island's international airport

The British grandmother is being kept in Kerobokan jail in Bali, Indonesia. Her appeal must be filed by February 12

But the government has made it clear it does not pay for the legal representation of its citizens arrested in other countries.

'I am so scared that we will lose the chance to appeal,' Mrs Parsons told the charity group.

'A lawyer should have started work on the case a week ago and every day that goes by is a day that Lindsay loses for preparing her appeal.

'We have nowhere else to turn. We desperately need the help of the British Foreign Office to ensure that Lindsay has a lawyer.'

Even if she finds a lawyer to launch her appeal, Mrs Sandiford, originally from Teeside, faces up to eight years in prison as her pleas for a lesser sentence grind through the notoriously slow Indonesian courts.

Even the first week since she was given the death sentence has proved a nightmare, with Mrs Sandiford hardly moving from her cell for exercise.

Convicted of carrying 10lbs of cocaine, worth £1.7million when she arrived at Bali airport last year, she spends most of the time sleeping in her small cell, which she has to share with several other women.

A warder said Mrs Sandiford was 'deeply depressed' and found little comfort even when her sister visited her each day.

Mrs Parsons has been telling her sister of her efforts outside the jail to find a lawyer – but both women are aware that the clock is ticking away against the condemned grandmother.
