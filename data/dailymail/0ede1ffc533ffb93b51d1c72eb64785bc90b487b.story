Fallen Cindarella: Amanda Movius, pictured here in a mugshot, married a Scottish lord in 1990 and became known as Lady Bruce, but after her divorce the mother of three turned to a life of crime in the US

The rags-to-riches story of a poor girl from Alaska who became the wife of a Scottish lord has come full circle when Amanda Bruce Grimes landed behind bars in Texas earlier this year.

But for the attractive, blonde mother of three who for a time was known in Scotland as Lady Bruce, the April arrest on credit card theft charges was only the latest in a long series of run-ins with the law.

Amanda Bruce Grimes, nee Movius, spent six months in a Texas prison in 2010 for committing theft involving a bogus Hawaiian rental home, Sunday Telegraph reported.

Not long after her release, the former wife of Scottish aristocrat Lord Bruce, heir to the earldom of Elgin, was back behind bars for stealing credit cards from people who thought they were renting a vacation rental property in Hawaii, which in reality did not exist, and using their information to rent houses for herself in Austin.

According to local reports, the former Scottish lady-turned-con artist used a similar setup to defraud a California journalist and a Canadian businessman - crimes that resulted in her incarceration between December 2009 and June 2010.

But repeated stints in prisons seemingly have not taught  Ms Grimes anything.

The Sunday Telegraph reported that the woman who at one time was a member of Scotland’s high society was busted in Hays County, Texas, four months ago under yet another alias, Amanda Reyna, on charges of credit card fraud and theft.

Immediately after bonding out of jail, the woman was arrested again on theft and fraud charges in Travis County, and thrown into the local jail where she remained until her release in June.

The previous year was also a busy one for Ms Grimes, who added counts of DUI, marijuana possession and blocking traffic to her already lengthy rap sheet.

Highlands elite: Charles Bruce, a descendant of King Robert the Bruce who as heir to the earldom of Elgin holds the title Lord Bruce, met and fell in love with Amanda Movius while she was vacationing in Scotland in 1989; the couple have three children together

The middle-aged, disgraced aristocrat is still wanted in Hays Country on a pair of outstanding charges of credit card fraud and identity theft.

Swapping names and identities has become a habit - as well as an illicit source of income - for Grimes over the past two decades.

Born Amanda Movius in the family of an Alaskan engineer and an alcoholic housewife who ended her life by drowning in a bathtub, the future con artist left Fairbanks at age 18 to go to college in Washington state.

In 1989, the then 22-year-old Amanda Movius went on vacation in Scotland where she met her future husband at a party.

‘When I met Charlie, I didn't have a clue who he was,’ she told Austin American Statesman. ‘It was just a typical boy-meets-girl situation.’

Lord Bruce, a descendant of the 14th century King Robert the Bruce and one of Scotland’s most eligible bachelors, was smitten by the vivacious blonde American.

Born Charles Bruce, his father is the 11th Earl of Elgin, and Lord Bruce will become the 12th. Their ancestor the Seventh Earl of Elgin took the Elgin Marbles, now found in the British Museum, from the Parthenon in Athens.

A whirlwind romance in the Highlands concluded with a fairy-tale wedding a year later, the Telegraph reported. 

The couple settled in a 19th century, 30,000-square-foot mansion in Fife staffed with maids and cooks at Lady Amanda’s beck and call. 

The small-time girl from Alaska was transformed into a high-society lady, donning designer clothes worth thousands of dollars and hosting glamorous charity events. 

Eight years and three children later, the marriage of Lord and Lady Bruce ended over claims of infidelity on the part of the wife.

Amanda left Scotland in 2000 amid allegations that she abandoned her children’s clothing store and settled her creditors with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt - a claim she has denied.

Lord Bruce was granted custody of their daughter and two sons, who are now in their early 20s. Their eldest son, James, holds the title Master of Bruce and will become 13th Earl of Elgin.

The former Scottish socialite returned to the US and moved to Seattle, where in 2003 she met and married David Grimes, a local real estate developer.

Spinning tales: In 2007, Amanda Grimes moved out to California, where she presented herself as a screenwriter. To bolster her credentials, she would show new acquaintances in Hollywood a photo of herself posing with actors Woody Harrelson, Keanu Reeves and Robert Downey Jr on the set of A Scanner Darkly

But her second marriage collapsed only a year later. Looking back on their brief history together, David Grimes told The Telegraph that Amanda was a ‘mystery’ to him.

Not long after the breakup, Grimes was arrested for failing to pay for a hotel room in Seattle and using a stolen credit card. She pleaded guilty but skipped town before sentencing.

In 2007, Amanda Grimes moved out to California, where she presented herself as a screenwriter. To bolster her credentials, she would show new acquaintances in Hollywood a photo of herself posing with actors Woody Harrelson, Keanu Reeves and Robert Downey Jr on the set of A Scanner Darkly.

It was around that time, according to law enforcement officials, that the twice-divorced mother of three came upon the Hawaii vacation home scheme where she would use a PayPal account to try and rent the same fictitious property to multiple people. 

Working under the alias Amanda George, Grimes allegedly duped, among others, Los Angeles Times travel editor Catharine Hamm who paid the bogus rental agent $5,000 to spend her upcoming honeymoon in Hawaii.

According to police in Austin, Amanda Grimes-George used the proceeds from her fraudulent dealings to rent homes for herself in the Texas state capital.

Eventually, Grimes' elaborate lies caught up with her, and she pleaded guilty in 2010 to four felony counts.

Speaking to the Austin American Statesman from the Woodman State Jail in Gatesville that year, the woman maintained her innocence, dismissing the numerous allegations against her as misunderstandings; she also sounded eager to turn a new leaf.

‘I'll be out in time to spend summer with my children,’ she said at the time. ‘I'm just ready to put this behind me.’
