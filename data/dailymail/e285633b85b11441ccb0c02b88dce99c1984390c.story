Britain’s most reluctant bride who spent 40 years rejecting her partner’s marriage proposals finally married him and joked: 'I’m worth the wait.'

Ann Turner, 72, repeatedly turned Chris Green down every time he popped the question until she finally said ‘yes’ on his 75th birthday.

And yesterday she walked down the aisle when she and Chris were married at St Matthews Church in Harlaston, Staffs.

Meant to be: Ann Turner was reluctant to marry boyfriend Chris Green, saying marriage was 'just a piece of paper' but when she finally did walk down the aisle said she was 'thrilled' - and joked she was 'worth the wait'

Ann, who arrived at the church in a gold-coloured Rolls Royce, said: 'It’s been a lovely day and Chris has never looked more handsome.

'I'm thrilled he kept persisting and asking me to marry him.

'It’s been a lovely day for us and our family.

'He keeps saying to me ‘I knew you’d marry me one day’ I just tell him ‘I’m worth the wait.'

Chris and Ann first met at the Alrewas British Legion Club in Staffordshire in 1973 and hit it off almost straight away.

Ann’s first husband had left her for another woman a year earlier and Chris’s first wife had died of cancer when he was only 32.

After a few months Chris plucked up the courage to propose but Ann turned him down because she didn’t feel ready.

Optimistic: Chris Green, 75 said he knew Ann would accept eventually. For her part, Ann said she was 'thrilled' he kept persisting

Determined: Retired miner Chris whisked care worker Ann on multiple romantic weekends in an attempt to seduce her into saying yes - but was never successful until now

Ann, a retired care worker, also told Chris getting married was just a “pointless piece of paper” but agreed to move in with him.

Over the next 40 years Chris popped the question hundreds of times and even carried around an engagement ring in his pocket in case Ann changed her mind.

Retired miner Chris spent thousands of pounds taking Ann away on romantic weekend breaks and showering her with flowers and gifts - but her answer was always ‘no’.

Devoted: Chris proposed hundreds of times over the four decades the two were together - and carried an engagement ring with him at all times in case Ann changed her mind

But yesterday Chris said he was 'delighted' to have finally married Ann.

He said: “It might have taken me 40 years to make an honest woman of her but she’s worth it.'I love her dearly and always knew she was the one. 

'I’m glad we’ve finally done it and I don’t have to carry that engagement ring around with me anymore.'

Soulmates: 'I love her dearly and always knew she was the one,' said Chris

Good times: On another of the fun holidays Chris planned to show Ann how much he cared

In love: The happy couple on holiday in St Ives, Cornwall in 1993, and right, in 1987 at the wedding of one of their daughters. The couple have eight children from previous marriages

The couple got married in front of their eight children - four each from previous marriages - and their 12 grandchildren, as well as 100 friends.

Ann was given away by her grandson Chris Haime while Chris arrived at the church on a horse and trap driven by his best man John Arnold, 73.

After the hour-long ceremony the pair enjoyed a private reception before leaving for a two week honeymoon to Poole in Dorset.
