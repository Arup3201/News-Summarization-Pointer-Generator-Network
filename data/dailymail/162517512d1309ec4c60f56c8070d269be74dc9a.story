A coroner yesterday urged parents to stop their children using adult video games after a boy of 14 hanged himself after playing Call of Duty.

Callum Green regularly played the Certificate 18 game with his stepfather despite it featuring gruesome scenes of soldiers trying to kill each other.

The boy’s behaviour deteriorated and, after being grounded by his mother following a row, he was found hanging by his school tie from his bunk bed.

Tragic: Callum Green hanged himself after he had played the controversial video game Call of Duty

Scary: Call of Duty has an 18 certificate and is one of the gorier video games on the market

At the inquest, coroner John Pollard 
issued a warning to parents to ensure children do not have access to 
adult-only video games.

He said: ‘The age limitations on these
various computer games are there for a very valid reason and I do see 
the evidence of inappropriate computer games.

‘It’s very important that young 
children don’t play them or have access to them. I make a plea with 
parents to keep a very close eye on their children in that way.’

Earlier this year, Norwegian mass 
killer Anders Breivik claimed he had ‘trained himself’ to kill his 77 
victims by playing Call of Duty.

French terrorist Mohammed Merah also 
played Call Of Duty before killing three soldiers and four civilians – 
including a rabbi and three children – in Toulouse in March.

The violence in Call of Duty has been 
criticised by the London Jewish Forum, the British Muslim Forum and 
Church of England ministers.

Yesterday’s inquest was told Callum, 
of Brinnington, Stockport, frequently played the game with his 
stepfather, David White.

Devastated: Emma Green, mother of Callum, admitted she had alowed him to play Call Of Duty but not other games

Callum’s mother, Emma Green, admitted she knew 
about the game’s age restriction but had allowed him to play.

She said: ‘Callum was 14, 15. He was 
very mature. Kids play worse games than that. He was allowed to play 
Call of Duty but not other games. He was only allowed a few hours on the
PC.

‘Does that make me a bad parent 
because I let him play those games? I banned him from other games where 
they slash their throats and stuff, I stopped him playing that, but Call
of Duty I didn’t.’

The court heard the schoolboy had 
argued with his parents after repeatedly asking his 13-year-old 
girlfriend whether she wanted to have a baby with him. She said: ‘He 
kept asking if I would have a kid with him and I said no, I’d only just 
turned 13. He said he wanted to get away from home.’

Days before he died, Callum was 
grounded by his parents because he had not returned from his  
girlfriend’s home until 11.20pm. On the afternoon of his death  he had 
been off school with a sprained ankle and had argued with his younger 
sister when she came home.

A plate had been smashed in the 
kitchen and Callum had gone to his bedroom to use his computer, although
his family believed he was only surfing Facebook and YouTube.

At around 4.50pm, his mother went upstairs and found Callum hanging by a tie from his bunk bed.

Recording an open verdict,  Stockport 
coroner Mr Pollard told the family: ‘For whatever reason and it is, I’m 
afraid, somewhat mysterious, Callum just decided that he was going to 
put the tie around his neck and suspend himself from the bunk beds.

‘Was that with the intention of killing himself or just to give you a shock, we don’t know.’

Miss Green said her son had never given any indication of wanting to harm himself or being unhappy.

Teachers at Callum’s school, Audenshaw High, said they could find no evidence that he had been bullied there.

issued a warning to all parents after about ultra-violent games like 
Call Of Duty, played famously by mass murderer Anders Breivik, right
