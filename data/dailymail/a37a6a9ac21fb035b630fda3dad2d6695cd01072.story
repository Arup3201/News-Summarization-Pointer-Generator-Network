A three-year-old boy who went missing from his parents' house was found in a neighbour's garden pond but died after a desperate attempt to save his life.

The little boy, named locally as Harvey-Lee Williams, is believed to have wandered off while his parents were in the middle of packing boxes to move to a new house.

Officers were called to the toddler's north Wales home after his family noticed he had disappeared.

They found his body in a neighbour's garden which is around 100 metres from where he lived.

Horrifying: The boy, named locally as Harvey-Lee Williams, vanished from his home in Froncysyllte, north Wales (centre) while his parents packed boxes to move house. His body was found in a neighbour's ornamental pond

Rural tragedy: The road which the toddler would have crossed to reach the ornamental ponds, right

Death: A closer side view of the two ponds in the north Wales village, which were connected by a waterfall

Discovery: The boy was found in the ornamental pond in his neighbour's garden (viewed from above)

One of the last people to see the toddler
alive described how he was 'happy, energetic and smiling' and playing with the family dog.

Family and neighbours paid tribute to the boy and said it was particularly painful that his mother, Amy Dipper, and her partner, had to cope with the tragedy at Christmas time and as they prepared for a new life together.

Geoff Jones, 65, said: 'It really chokes you up, the loss of a young child is appalling.

'I saw him just an hour or two before he was reported missing and he was as playful as ever with the family dog in the garden.

'Whenever I saw him with his mum in the street he was a ball of energy 
and smiles, it's so tragic. The family were lovely, lovely people.

'They must have only taken their eyes off him for a few seconds, and he's wandered off down the road.'

Route: It was believed that Harvey-Lee walked down this path from his family's terraced home to the neighbour's garden

Effort: Neighbours said they thought Harvey-Lee had climbed over this small fence to reach the garden

The youngster was found in a shallow water feature in the property 
sitting behind his family's house in Froncysllte, Llangollen, Denbighshire. Neighbours claim he would have had to walk
around 100 metres to reach it.

There are two ponds connected by a waterfall - which was turned off at 
the time - and can be reached by a narrow walkway just down the road.

The boy's parents alerted emergency services as soon as they noticed their son was missing but his body was found in the pond shortly after police officers arrived.

His cousin Britt Elvins said the three-year-old had been an inspiration to the family.

'He was born with autism and was such a brave little boy, he was an inspiration to all,' she said.

'My little cousin had a horrible accident and within a split second he was an angel in the sky.

'He was bought up by a wonderful mum who 
tried her hardest to give him the normal life they all wanted him to 
enjoy along with his big brother.'

Emergency: The three-year-old was rushed to Wrexham Maelor Hospital after he was found in the pond close to his home, but died soon after his arrival

Close friend Kate Turner also praised the boy's mother: 'Amy was a fantastic mum and did everything she could for Harvey-Lee.

'She will be torn apart by this - they had just bought a new house and were looking forward to a new life.

'To happen just two weeks before Christmas is a tragedy - the family 
would have been preparing to enjoy it with Harvey-Lee and his elder 
sister.

'They would have had presents, dinner plans, family plans - it's all ruined now.'

Emergency services rushed the child 
from the village, which is not far from the border with England, to 
Wrexham Maelor Hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

'This is a tragic incident about a 
young boy who has died and we are working with the family to support 
them,' said a police spokesman.

'Officers continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding his sad passing.

'We
attended an address after receiving a report of a missing child, and a 
short time later the child was found close by in a garden pond.

'Despite the efforts of medical staff he sadly passed away.'

The boy had gone missing in the Welsh village of Frocysyllte, not far from Wrexham and close to the border with England

His grieving family were today being comforted by a police family liaison officer.

A post-mortem examination is expected to take place before a coroner's inquest in Wrexham will be held.

A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said: 'Ambulance crews were 
called at 12.07pm on Monday to a medical emergency in Froncysyllte, near
Llangollen.

'We sent two emergency ambulances to the scene, supported by an 
ambulance officer, and a three-year-old boy was taken to Wrexham Maelor 
Hospital.

'He was pronounced dead a short time later.'

Wrexham councillor for Llangollen 
Rural, Pat Jeffares, who lives in the neighbouring village of Trevor, 
returned home from a group meeting at the Guildhall in Wrexham last 
night to be made aware of the death.

'I’ve only just heard that a little one was drowned,' he said.

'It’s such a tragedy - so sad.'

Llangollen Rural community councillor Mark Valentine said his thoughts were with the family at what was a terrible time.

'I know all the people of Llangollen Rural and beyond wish the family all our deepest sympathies.'
