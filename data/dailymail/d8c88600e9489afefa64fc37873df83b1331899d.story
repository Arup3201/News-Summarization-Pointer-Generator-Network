These incredible pictures show British wing-walkers performing spectacular stunts at 150mph - over Kuwait.

The women were exposed to extreme conditions as they were flown through the air at daunting heights performing the daring aerobatics.

They were flown on a classic duo of 1930 Boeing Stearman biplanes which performed manoeuvres including loops, rolls, stall turns and even inverted flights.

The breath-taking display over Kuwait required the close coordination of the aircraft pilots and wing-walkers, along with a well-rehearsed routine and close formation flypast.

All came together to result in a dazzling display which has been performed at over 2,500 events worldwide.

The phenomenal stunt was planned to coincide with the opening of the first Breitling boutique in the country, on Friday.

The luxury Swiss watch brand organised the special free public display above Marina Crescent in Kuwait City as the world-famous Breitling Wing-walking team made their 2014 debut display.

It was the world's only aerobatic formation wing-walking team's last performance in the Middle East region, before they return home to Europe.

Martyn Carrington, Director of Flying for the Breitling Wingwalkers, said: 'It's an honor to be invited to Kuwait by Breitling.

'It's always exciting to visit different countries and display to new audiences. As well as buzzing over the crowds at Marina Crescent, we hope to do some flights past the iconic skyline and the Liberation Tower.'

Aed Adwan, Breitling Sales Manager, Middle East, is pleased to welcome the team to Kuwait.

'We are lucky to have such a well-known and highly regarded team here to represent the company's aviation heritage.'
