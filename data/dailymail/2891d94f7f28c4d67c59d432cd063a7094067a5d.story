Violent turmoil in the Middle East could indirectly lead to millions of people starving from food shortages, research suggests.

Scientists have found that the highest concentration of wild crop plants needed to produce new food varieties lie in an area known as the Fertile Crescent.

However, this area is also at the centre of a number of civil wars that are placing valuable crop species at risk of extinction.

Scientists in the UK have found that the highest concentration of wild crop plants needed to produce new food varieties is in an area known as the Fertile Crescent, which includes Israel (pictured)

The Fertile Crescent is an ancient area of fertile soil arcing around the Arabian desert from Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and ending in Iraq and Iran.

It has the largest diversity of 'crop wild relatives' (CWRs) - species closely related to our crops which are needed to create future 'super crop' varieties.

These wild relatives of crops grow naturally outside mainstream agriculture and possess a number of useful traits including drought tolerance, yield improvement, and resilience to pests and diseases.

Given that the human population is set to expand from the 7.26 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050, CWRs will be needed to improve crop yields and feed the extra people.

Crop wild relative of wheat (pictured), Aegilops tauschii, is resistant to Hessian Fly which is pest of cereals

But researchers at Birmingham have shown that 12 per cent of CWRs are threatened with extinction and all are likely to be already suffering a loss of genetic diversity.

Scientists have created the inventory lists 173 crops and their 1667 priority wild relatives, along with their particular traits.

For example, the wild relative of the wheat crop, Aegilops tauschii, is resistant to Hessian Fly which is pest of cereal crops.

Saccharum arundinaceumis is a relative of sugar cane and can survive very low temperatures, while  Prunus ferganensis, the crop wild relative of peach, is tolerant to drought conditions

The research team is currently involved in a new initiative by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to help conserve the wild relatives of crop plants in the country's within the Fertile Crescent

Their research found the largest collection of seeds in the Fertile Crescent is in Syria and believed to be under the control of rebel forces.

The research team is currently involved in a new initiative by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to help conserve the wild relatives of crop plants in these countries.

They are currently negotiating with governments in the Fertile Crescent to implement conservation schemes in biodiversity 'hotspots'.

They are also taking samples and placing them in gene banks as a safety back up, where the genetic material can be kept for up to 300 years.

'There has previously been no opportunity to systematically conserve and use CWR as there was a lack of clarity over their identities and distribution,' said Dr Nigel Maxted, lead investigator from the University of Birmingham's School of Biosciences.

'By creating an inventory of globally important CWR we can discover which countries and regions are the richest in terms of priority CWR, and more efficiently plan and coordinate conservation efforts to ensure their survival.'
