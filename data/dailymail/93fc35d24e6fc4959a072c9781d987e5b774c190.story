Stoke player Phil Bardsley has married partner and former glamour model Tanya Robinson.

Bardsley, 28, tied the knot with 31-year-old Robinson on Saturday before the newly-wed couple jetted off to Los Angeles for their honeymoon.

Robinson, one of FHM's original High Street Honeys, tweeted photos of the big day and called Bardsley the 'love of my life'.

The 
wedding comes two weeks after Bardsley signed for Stoke on a 
three-and-a-half year deal after the out-of-contract defender opted to 
leave Sunderland.

Bardsley's
 wife once labelled former Sunderland manager Paolo Di Canio as a 
'psycho drama queen' after the Italian vowed never to pick Bardsley
 again.

Robinson tweeted last year: 'Heâ€™s [Bardsley] not raped or killed any1 so certain people need to stop being psycho drama queens.'
