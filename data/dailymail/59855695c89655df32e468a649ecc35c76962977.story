A New Zealand mother, dubbed the Black Widow for murdering her husband, has been ordered to pay compensation from behind bars after she sent herself a series of abusive text messages and then tried to frame her son, leading to him being falsely imprisoned.

Helen Milner, 50, will have to pay Adam Kearns, 23, $55,000 after the High Court in Christchurch, New Zealand, deemed her actions to be 'outrageous and calculated', and designed to put her son behind bars.

The New Zealand Herald reported that in April 2010, Milner informed police that Mr Kearns had sent her and his ex girlfriend, Kasey Woodstock, death threats.

She told officers her son, who was thought to have breached a protection order, was 'extremely aggressive' and that she feared for her safety.

Mr Kearns was held in custody for more than a fortnight before it was revealed Milner actually sent the bogus messages herself but were made to look like they were from her son.

The discovery saw Mr Kearns launch civil action, claiming 'hurt, distress, humiliation' and financial loss from being put in jail.

Milner is currently serving a life sentence in jail for the murder of her husband Phillip James Nisbet in 2009.

She was found to have poisoned her husband's dinner by mixing in the drug Phenergan and then may have suffocated him once he was sedated.

Milner also tried to present Mr Nisbet's murder as a suicide attempt and fabricated several notes and a suicide cellphone text to deceive his family, friends and police and cover her tracks.

It's believed she was motivated by her husband's $250,000 life insurance policy. 

To this day, Milner still proclaims her innocence and is currently trying to appeal against her conviction through New Zealand's supreme court.

Mr Kearns lawyer Kerry Cook, described the mother's behaviour as 'wicked'.

'Such conduct defies the supposed maternal bond between a mother and her child,' the New Zealand Herald reported Ms Cook telling the court.  

Justice Christian Whata, who described the case as clear cut, said Milner's conduct was 'outrageous and calculated', ruling her to pay her son compensation.

'It was a difficult step to take his mother to court, but as the judge said, she had framed him, and so he took an unusual step in what was an unusual case,' Ms Cook told the New Zealand Herald outside court.

Mr Kearns was also glad the decision had finally given him some closure and he would be seeking to chase up the funds his mother owed him. 

'She’s dead to me. I’ll never speak to her again,' he told stuff.co.nz
