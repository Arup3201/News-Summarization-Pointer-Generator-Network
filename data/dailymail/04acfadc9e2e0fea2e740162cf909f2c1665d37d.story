Luis Suarez was a goal machine during his time at Liverpool but he never quite managed to hit top form against Manchester City, the team he will face with Barcelona on Tuesday night.

The Uruguayan could start alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar in a front three which City defender Pablo Zabaleta has claimed is 'perhaps the best strikeforce in the world'.

But Suarez, who is no stranger to Manuel Pellegrini's men, has only found the back of the net once during six games against Sergio Aguero and Co.

The 28-year-old played six Premier League fixtures against City during his time with Liverpool, including the memorable 3-2 home win towards the end of last season.

However, his only goal arrived in August 2012 when he curled home a free-kick in a pulsating 2-2 draw at Anfield - leaving him goalless at the Etihad, the venue for Tuesday's Champions League last-16 first leg.

Suarez failed to score in his other five appearances against City despite playing the full 90 minutes in each, although he did register an assist in April last year when he set up a Raheem Sterling opener.

The ex-Ajax man's shooting has been wayward against the Manchester outfit, with just seven of his 22 attempts having hit the target. Suarez has also been booked in three of his six games and the reigning Premier League champions.

Liverpool won two of the six games against City in which Suarez played and suffered defeat just once, a 2-1 reverse on Boxing Day in 2013.
