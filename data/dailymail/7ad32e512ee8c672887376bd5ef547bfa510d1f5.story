It seems even after 18 years, the image of Colin Firth emerging from a lake, dressed in white and dripping wet, is hard to forget.

The scene in which he walks out of a lake in Pride And Prejudice has been named the most memorable moment in British TV drama

The moment, from a BBC adaptation first screened in 1995, held off challenges from soaps, children's series Grange Hill and more contemporary programmes.

The scene in which Colin Firth emerges from a lake in Pride And Prejudice has been named the most memorable moment in British TV drama

Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Darcy from the 1995 BBC television programme. It held off challenges from soaps, children's series Grange Hill and more contemporary programmes to take the title

Firth's scene - filmed at Lyme Park in Cheshire - was way out in front in the poll to mark the launch of new free-to-air UKTV channel Drama, which begins broadcasting on Monday.

The scene left millions of women swooning and transformed Colin Firth into a household name.

But he has previously revealed that he had not read the novel when he was offered the part, and nearly turned it down.'I really don't believe I ever belonged in romantic roles. And when Darcy came along I thought it was weird they were asking me to play a romantic lead at 35.'

1. Mr Darcy's lake scene - Pride And Prejudice (1995) 2. Dirty Den hands divorce papers to Angie - EastEnders (1986) 3. Sherlock Holmes's "death" - Sherlock (2012) 4. Tram crash - Coronation Street (2010) 5. Who killed Danny Latimer? - Broadchurch (2013) 6. The 10th Doctor regenerates from David Tennant to Matt Smith - Doctor Who (2010) 7. First lesbian kiss - Brookside (1994) 8. Morse reveals his Christian name - Inspector Morse (1997) 9. Zammo injects heroin - Grange Hill (1987) 10. Lady Sybil's death - Downtown Abbey (2012)

Runner-up in the list, compiled from the votes of 2,000 people, was the Christmas Day edition of EastEnders in 1986 in which Dirty Den handed divorce papers to wife Angie.

Third place - drawn from a longlist of 50 scenes - went to the finale of BBC1's Sherlock last year in which detective Holmes faked his own death by plummeting from the roof of St Bart's hospital in London.

The most recent moment in the top 10 comes from ITV drama Broadchurch earlier this year, while the oldest dates back to 1987 when Grange Hill featured character Zammo using heroin.

Adrian Wills, general manager of the Drama channel said: 'It is clear from our research that Mr Darcy emerging from the lake in Pride And Prejudice continues to set hearts racing amongst TV viewers.'Â
