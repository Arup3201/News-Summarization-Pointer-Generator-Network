A FedEx truck has overturned in northern New Jersey, spilling dozens of packages on what is typically the famed delivery company's busiest day of the year.

The crash occurred at around 2:45 a.m. Monday on Interstate 289 in Mahwah.

Authorities say the driver lost control of the double-trailer and veered off the right side of the road, then went down a grass median and ended up on an exit ramp.
