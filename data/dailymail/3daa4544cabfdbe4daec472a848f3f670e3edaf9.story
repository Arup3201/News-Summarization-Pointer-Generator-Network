Endurance-swimming grandmother Diana Nyad finally reached shore today following her record-breaking journey of 103 miles from Cuba to the Florida Keys.

The 64-year-old achieved her life-long dream after four failed attempts, completing the grueling swim in 52 hours, 54 minutes and 18.6 seconds, to tell her millions of fans: 'Never ever give up.'

Looking dazed and sunburned, Ms Nyad walked on to the Key West shore on Monday, becoming the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without the help of a shark cage.

As she approached, spectators surrounded her in the shallow waters, taking pictures and cheering her on as she limped on to Smathers Beach.

Once on the beach, she was put on a stretcher and received medical treatment, including an IV. Her lips were swollen.

It was Nyad's fifth try to complete the approximately 110-mile swim. She tried three times in 2011 and 2012. She had also tried in 1978.

Nyad tweeted today: 'I got 3 messages: 1 is we should #NeverEverGiveUp , 2 is #NeverTooOld to chase dreams , 3 is #NeverASolitarySport it's a team.'

Congratulatory messages began to pour in from around the world for the 64-year-old grandmother. 

President Obama tweeted: 'Congratulations to @DianaNyad. Never give up on your dreams.'

Desperate Housewives actress Marcia Cross shared a video of Nyad swimming and wrote: 'Nyad Completes Historic Swim WATCH THIS!! Xxoo m.'

The 64-year-old's last attempt was cut short amid boat trouble, storms, unfavorable currents and jellyfish stings that left her face puffy and swollen.

This time she wore a full bodysuit, gloves, booties and a mask at night, when jellyfish rise to the surface. Before the swim, she said the kit would slow her down, but she believed it would be effective.

The support team accompanying her had equipment that generated a faint electrical field around her, which was designed to keep sharks at bay.

A boat also dragged a line in the water to help keep her on course.

Cheers: Nyad, 64, came into shore but not before she paused to thank her supportive team on Monday

A live map has been documenting Diana's progress since she set off from Havana on Saturday morning. She is now only two miles from Key West

The swimmer paused on Monday to 
give a statement of thanks to her team before embarking on the final two
miles of the grueling feat.

Ms Nyad said: 'This
is a lifelong dream of mine and I'm very very glad to be with you. Some
on the team are the most intimate friends of my life and some of you 
I've just met.'

'But I'll 
tell you something, you're a special group. You pulled through; you are 
pros and have a great heart. So let's get going so we can have a 
whopping party.

'Thank you, all of you, thank you for your generosity.'

Nyad told supporters a silicone mask 
she wore to protect her face from jellyfish stings caused bruises inside
her mouth, making it difficult for her to talk.

Doctors
traveling with Nyad were worried about her slurred speech and her 
breathing, but they didn't intervene, according to her website.

Nyad's journey began on Saturday morning
when she jumped from the seawall of the Hemingway Marina into the warm 
waters off Havana. She stopped from time to time for nourishment.

'I
admit there's an ego rush,' Nyad said before the swim began. 'If I - 
three days from now, four days from now — am still somehow bringing the 
arms up and I see the shore … I am going to have a feeling that no one 
yet on this planet has ever had.'

The swimmer's support team which 
includes kayakers, shark divers and five boats with crews, snapped into 
safety protocol when a storm hit at 11pm on Sunday.

Nyad
however was 'still swimming strong' with the watchful shark divers by 
her side.

A radio communication to one of the support team's vessel 
said: 'Prepare for the worst, hoping for the best'.

At 1.27am, the team decided they were free of danger and 'got the flotilla back in normal formation quickly.'

Good start: Diana Nyad began her swim on Saturday morning at Hemingway Marina to start her attempt at swimming from Cuba to Florida. She was just shy of 20 miles from completing the swim this morning

The swimmer will take regular breaks 
to eat, but must remain in the water and isn't allowed to touch the side
of the boat that will be tracking her progress.

'This
is farther than she has gone in any previous attempt,' team navigator 
John Bartlett wrote on Nyad's website yesterday. 'Her path is only 5 
miles to the east of a straight line from Marina Hemingway to Key West, 
thanks to a favorable Gulf Stream.'

A post on Nyad's blog said she was doing well and the crew is upbeat, though she expressed some fatigue 
during a pause to eat. Doctors examine her regularly and say 'she's 
looking very good.'

As of 9am Sunday morning, Nyad was over 38 miles into her swim, averaging 1.6 miles per hour.

Nyad keeps hydrated and fueled with smoothies, 'shot blocks', peanut butter sandwiches and pasta.

'She's right on the bullseye,' navigator John Bartlett said. 'We are just approaching the strongest flow of the Gulfstream about 15 miles ahead of us. At that point, the flow direction will change and that will help us big time.'

Helpers: A group of boats are following Nyad on her journey, helping to spot jellyfish and sharks as she swims day and night to reach the Florida Keys

Perilous: One of the greatest dangers Nyad faces is the dangerous Box Jellyfish which could render her paralyzed if stung

It's Nyad's fifth attempt at the feat in the last three years. She also made an unsuccessful try with a cage in 1978.

The swimmer expected to take about 80 hours to reach the Florida Keys.

This
attempt is different though, in that Nyad will be swimming at night 
with the aid of a silicon mask to protect herself from Box Jellyfish.

The Box Jellyfish is one of the world's most venomous creatures. They actively hunt their prey and their stings can send the body into paralysis.

Since 1950, more people have died from Box Jellyfish stings than from shark bites.

This
year she had prosthetics maker Stefan Knauss custom make a face mask 
that she could wear at night when the jellyfish are harder to see.

She
says it's harder to swim while wearing, but she tested it out in a 
swarm of hundreds of Box Jellyfish this past June and wasn't stung once.

Nyad's handlers were giving fans status updates on Sunday through her website.

Has it made a difference? The mask was custom made by prosthetics maker Stefan Knauss to shield her entire face from the jellyfish. Last time she only wore panty hose and still got stung
