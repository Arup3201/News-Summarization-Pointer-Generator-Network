A California teen, his mother and a friend were arrested Tuesday in connection with the violent murder of his ex-girlfriend’s father.

Edward 'Anthony' Morales and Richard Gonzalez, both 18, have been accused of abducting and brutally murdering Alejandro Padilla July 26 as revenge for the father trying to protect his daughter from the violent teen. Morales’ mother, Alma Casada, 37, was arrested and accused of being an accomplice to the brutal slaying, according to reports.

Padilla, 40, was found July 27 by police in the backseat of his burned-out car in Fontana, CA., reports said.

Cops allege Morales and Gonzalez savagely beat Padilla the morning of July 26 with a baseball bat, splattering the helpless man’s blood all over his driveway, garage door and the side of his home. The teens then took him to a local park where the set his car on fire with him in the back seat. Investigators recovered the bat at Padilla's house, according to KTLA.

'It's just heartbreaking to know that somebody like him, a young kid, could do something this harmful to an innocent man,' family friend Valerie Granados told KTLA.

It is not clear if Padilla was alive when the car was set ablaze, it also not clear exactly how Casada is involved in the murder. When contacted by Mail Online, Fontana Police declined to comment.

'In my heart, I was hoping that person wasn't involved, we prayed that he wasn't invovled,' Alejandro Padilla's mourning widow Lilliana Pelayo told reporters.

Beloved: Alejandro Padilla, 40, had no criminal record and no enemies, according to friends and family

Morales, referred to as Anthony by family and friends, dated Alejandro Padilla’s daughter Emily, 18, for about a year before she broke up with him, family members told KTLA. The troubled Morales did not take the breakup well, becoming angry and violent, according to a family friend.

‘Anthony seemed pretty obsessed with Emily,’ Tony Granados told KTLA.

Morales allegedly kept harassing the young woman after the end of their relationship to the point that Alejandro Padilla felt it necessary to seek an order of protection to protect his daughter, friends told KTLA.

‘He was having problems with Anthony, basically trying to keep Anthony away from his daughter,’ Granados told the station.

When Alejandro Padilla first went missing, cops initially believed it may have been a case of mistaken identity. Family members speaking to the media only hours after their beloved father and husband went missing were in disbelief he was missing.

‘I can’t think of anybody that would want to hurt him,’ Pelayo said between tears.

‘It's just too hard to believe,’ daughter Danielle Padilla said. ‘It seems so surreal. It seems like a nightmare. I just want to wake up,’ daughter Danielle Padilla sobbed.

Soon after the Alejandro Padilla’s charred body was found in his scorched 2009 Nissan Versa at a park about six miles from the family’s home, and prior to any suspects being named, a heartbroken Emily Padilla pleaded with the murder to come forward.

‘He doesn’t deserve this. Nobody deserves this…I know that if you were in my position, you’d want to find who killed your father,’ she tearfully said.

The loving father had no criminal history, not even a speeding ticket, according to KTLA, and was said to have no enemies, according to the Fontana Herald, initially leaving investigators clueless and leading to his inconsolable family to put up $10,000 reward for the capture of his killer.

All three suspects were arrested without incident, the Herald reported. Alejandro Padilla's family has since moved out of the house he was abducted from, according to KTLA.
