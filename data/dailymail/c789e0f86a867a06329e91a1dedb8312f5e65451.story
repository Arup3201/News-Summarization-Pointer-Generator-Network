A multi-millionaire Tory backer known as 'King Prawn' has become embroiled in an embarrassing row after trying to claim a £12,000 donation to the party on expenses.

Frozen food entrepreneur Iqbal Ahmed, appointed to a think tank by George Osborne after a separate donation to the Chancellor, tried to obtain the money from the British Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce.

Members declared their 'shock' and refused on the grounds that the organisation is strictly non-political. And they have written to the Chancellor calling on him to investigate.

Iqbal Ahmed, who has £90million fortune from Seamark - known for 'quality shrimps' - tried to claim a £12,000 donation to the Tory party on expenses

Mr Ahmed, 58, has amassed an estimated £90million fortune from Seamark – best known for the Mr Prawn line of 'quality cooked shrimps'.

He has given a total of £26,000 to the Tories, made up of £12,000 to the party headquarters and £14,000 to Mr Osborne's Cheshire constituency of Tatton – where Mr Ahmed lives – between 2006 and last year.

In 2007, Mr Osborne, then Shadow Chancellor, appointed Mr Ahmed to the New Enterprise Council think tank, set up to advise him on 'entrepreneurship and investment'. He has also been awarded the OBE for 'services to international trade'.

The dispute centres on Mr Ahmed's expenses claims during his year as chairman of the organisation in 2011. 

Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday show they include claims for hotel rooms and meals, including a £252 lunch at The Ivy restaurant in London. 

But they also include a demand to reimburse him for a £12,000 donation to Conservative head office in 2011.

When the chamber of commerce, which represents Bangladeshi businessmen and women, refused to pay up, it received a letter from Mr Ahmed's solicitors demanding the money.

The letter, sent last December, calls for the £12,000 to be 'paid without delay... by bank transfer'.

The president of the chamber, Matab Chowdhury, rejected it and has written to Mr Osborne to complain, saying: 'We are shocked that Mr Ahmed is attempting to claim the £12,000 from us in expenses that he gave as a donation to the Conservative Party.'

He called on Mr Osborne to 'clarify the legal status of this donation'. The claim for the Tory donation is backed by a receipt that lists 'Conservative Campaign Headquarters' as the 'payee'. The chamber of commerce rejected other expenses claims by Mr Ahmed including a £338 bill for entertaining at the Cinnamon Club curry restaurant, a £55 bill from the Lahore Kebab House and £27.55 for 'entertainment' at a Nando's restaurant.

The row comes after a week in which party donors have come under intense scrutiny, with the Tories highlighting the complaints of some Labour backers that the party is 'anti-business' – while Labour has shot back that the Tories are 'bankrolled by hedge funds'.

Mr Ahmed, who regularly features in Asian rich lists, arrived in Britain in the early 1970s with his brothers, Kamal and Bilal.

Together they set up Iqbal Brothers to sell tropical fruit, before diversifying into frozen fish and establishing the Seamark group, whose range of products has earned Mr Ahmed his nickname in the Bangladeshi community of 'King Prawn'.

Last night, a Conservative Party spokesman said: 'The donation was correctly registered from Seamark. The dispute between Mr Ahmed and the British Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce is a private matter'.

A spokesman for Mr Ahmed said: 'I am not prepared to comment.' The British Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce also declined to comment.
