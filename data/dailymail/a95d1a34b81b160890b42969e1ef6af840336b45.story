Much-loved Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling has left Twitter after claiming another user had criticised his 14-year-old son and called him a 's****' goalkeeper.

Stelling, who fronts Sky's Soccer Saturday and the broadcaster's Champions League footage, told his 415,000 followers that he was quitting the social network because he did not trust he would be able to respond to 'some people in a correct way'.

The 58-year-old father-of-three said he was left 'steaming' after he confronted another user who he said had posted a message describing the presenter's teenage son as a 's****' goalkeeper.

Stelling told his followers the original tweet had been deleted, and other users of the site wrote that the person behind the post had scored against the teenager in a youth football cup match.

The presenter - who is a huge Hartlepool United fan and who fronts Gilette Soccer Saturday - wrote to the user: 'u called my son a s**** keeper then deleted it. Don't go all innocent now. It is not banter. It's abuse My son is 14.'

He then posted a number of messages apologising for his bad language. 

 

'My apologies for the language but this persons time line simply appalling. I got irritated. Hope I offended no one,' he wrote.

The former Countdown host then added: 'Sorry guys. People can abuse me but not my kids.'

Signing off from the social network he said: 'Thanks for your support over last couple of years. Am closing account as I don't trust myself to respond to some people in a correct way.'

The user, 'Zak', thought to also be a teenager, wrote on Twitter that his comments to the presenter had been 'just banter' and he 'didn't mean to upset' Stelling.

He added: 'Apologies Jeff. Your son is class. It was a miss hit volley that trickled into the net.'

Stelling's departure from Twitter on Monday came just days after another sports presenter, Jonathan Agnew, said he was quitting the site over 'bullies and trolls'.

The BBC cricket presenter wrote: 'Almost did this last night, but will now. This is not what Twitter was when I joined. I will now leave it to the bullies and trolls. Shame.'

He also changed his profile details to read: 'This account is currently used purely for monitoring Twitter news feeds. No tweeting and no interaction.'

However, since announcing he was leaving Twitter last week, he has returned to plug a new social network, Kicca.com, which he said had not launched yet, but 'will be huge', and would feature 'serious stars from all sports'.
