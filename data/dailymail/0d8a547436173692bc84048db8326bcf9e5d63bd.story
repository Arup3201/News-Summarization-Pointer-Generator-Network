A former college professor jailed for abducting a female student was revealed to have secretly fathered a child after swapping her believed father's sperm sample with his own at a fertility clinic where he worked.

Thomas R. Lippert served two years in prison for kidnapping a student from Purdue University, Indiana in 1975 and performing 'love experiments' on her including electroshock therapy, threatening her family and locking her up in a black box over a three-week period. 

Lippert went on to work at the Reproductive Medical Technologies clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1988 to 1993.

His deception was only revealed after a Utah family who visited the clinic for IVF in 1982 sent cheek swabs off for online genetic testing.

The results were shocking with the family discovering that their 21-year-old daughter Ashley was not related to the man she believed to be her father but instead was Lippert's child.

The mother of the family tracked down a cousin of Lippert's who revealed the man's past.  A genetic test with Lippert's 99-year-old mother revealed that Ashley is his daughter.

The girl's mother Paula told KUTV that she and her husband Jeff were 'shook' but she reminds herself that she loves her daughter as much as ever.

According to reports, Lippert would keep a wall of portraits of children born through the clinic at his desk and seemed 'proud' of them, sparking fears he may have secretly fathered other children.

Paula asked: 'All those photos of the babies that he was so proud of I thought, ''oh 
my god how many of those are his biological children?'''

Information as to just what happened at the sperm bank are sketchy as Lippert died in 1999 and the clinic closed in 1998.

Appeals are being made for anyone who received a sperm donation at this time and may have doubts to come forward.

CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist, has set up a site Was Your Child Fathered by Thomas Lippert? as she is concerned that there may be more children fathered by Lippert in the Salt Lake City area.

Lippert's widow, who did not have any children with the kidnapper said she was not surprised by the revelations, telling KUTV: 'I think, because Tom didnâ€™t have any kids, he wanted to have a lot of kids out there.'

Mrs Lippert said that she tried to leave her husband but that he had threatened to kill her.

Thomas Lippert worked at  Reproductive Medical Technologies clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1988 to 1993 where it is believed he swapped sperm samples with his own 

Lippert was found guilty of the abduction of fine-arts student Susan Wells Cochran, 21, when he was a 25-year-old law professor at Southwest State College in Marshall, Minnesota.

The professor, who was a friend of Miss Cochran, tried to 'brainwash her into falling in love with him' with the help of a student assistant Harold Ross Tenneson, 21.

The kidnappers drove Miss Cochran through several states after abducting her when she posted an ad for a ride to Boston to visit her boyfriend.

Miss Cochran told People: 'We got 30 miles out of town. And, well, that was it.'

She was forced to strip and endure electroshock therapy confined in a 'black box'. She was also forced to sleep in the same bed as Lippert but was not raped by him.

The student was found three weeks later at the Southwest State Library by FBI after a lengthy search for the missing woman.

Lippert accepted a plea bargain for the government and served two years in jail along with undergoing psychiatric treatment for 90 days.
