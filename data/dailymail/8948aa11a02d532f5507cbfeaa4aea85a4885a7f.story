Police have found 12 suspected illegal immigrants in the back of a refrigerated lorry after receiving a panicked 999 call from one of them.

Officers from the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) stopped the HGV after receiving a call from a man in the back just before 9am.

The call was traced to a lorry travelling northbound on the M6 and it was stopped between Hilton Park services and junction 10a near Birmingham.

A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'Just before 9am a distressed call was received from a man travelling in the back of a refrigerated lorry on the M6 northbound.

'He was requesting urgent assistance for himself and his companions.

'As a result of the information received officers from the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) co-ordinated a regional response, which included officers from Staffordshire Police, West Midlands Police and Highways Agency colleagues.

'CMPG officers were able to successfully stop the lorry between Hilton services and J10a.

'The 12 individuals, located within the vehicle, are now being seen by colleagues from the ambulance service should they require medical attention, and where appropriate will be taken into custody.

'We will now be working with our colleagues in immigration and border control to establish the exact circumstances of how these individuals came to be in the back of the lorry.'

Both sides of the motorway were closed for two hours while police and ambulance crews examined the people in the back of the lorry.

It is not yet clear where the lorry had been travelling from or whether it had crossed the Channel to Britain.

Last month, thirteen suspected illegal immigrants from Ethiopia were spotted running from the back of a lorry on another busy motorway.

Rush-hour traffic had to be slowed between junctions 12 and 13 of the M25 in Surrey as police dealt with the incident. The 13 men and women were later found walking along the motorway and were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences.  

In the same month a woman returned to her home in Elvington, near Dover after a trip to Tesco to find an illegal immigrant sitting in her driveway.  

There are currently around 2000 migrants sleeping rough in the French port of Calais as they try to get aboard ferries to Britain. 

Over the summer, Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart threatened to close the docks following an attempt by scores of mainly Eritreans and Sudanese to storm a ferry.

Ms Bouchart said she wanted ‘far more help from the British government’ to deal with people attempting to cross the Channel illegally.

The number of migrants in Calais has increased sharply in the past few months, and hundreds more are also camping out in other Channel ports including Dunkirk and Cherbourg.

All play a nightly game of cat-and-mouse with the police as they attempt to break into lorries in an attempt to get to the UK.

The migrants are mainly from Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea, and have travelled from north Africa to mainland Europe, usually through Italy.
