She was wrapped up against the cold in a faux fur coat…but it’s a blue Chelsea shirt that most of Britain will forever associate with Antonia de Sancha.

Her revelations that Tory government minister David Mellor made love to her in his club strip kept the nation amused for months.

Never mind that her infamous claim, along with the toe-sucking and spanking, were made up. The damage was done and Mr Mellor eventually quit the Cabinet.

Two decades on, the 51-year-old former soft porn actress whose affair with the married ‘minister for fun’ rocked John Major’s scandal-prone government, steadfastly avoids the limelight.

Her hair unkempt sitting outside a tapas restaurant in London’s Notting Hill, cigarette in one hand and a bottle of beer on the table in front of her, Ms de Sancha happily chatted with friends.

But approached outside her shabby, one-bedroom flat in nearby Willesden Green, North West London yesterday the woman who was seldom far from the headlines in 1992 was not keen to talk.

She gruffly barked: ‘I don’t want to speak to any journalists,’ before slamming her front door.

The minister and his mistress conducted their affair in a London flat lent to the actress by one of her friends, who bugged his own phone and sold the tapes to a newspaper.

Contrast: Although she was wrapped up in a coat, the item of clothing most associate with Miss de Sancha is still a certain Chelsea shirt

The lover: David Mellor, pictured on the night he quit as Heritage Secretary in 1992, following a number of scandals, including his affair with Miss de Sancha

In the ensuing blaze of embarrassing publicity, then Secretary of State for National Heritage Mr Mellor tried to convince the world that his marriage to ever-loyal wife Judith was fine, despite Ms de Sancha’s sordid sex revelations, lining up his entire family behind the garden gate at his in-laws’ cottage in Sussex for press photographers.

The minister remained in the Cabinet for several months until he quit after it was revealed that he had accepted a free holiday from femme fatale Mona Bauwens, the daughter of a Palestinian Liberation Organisation official.

Two years later Mr Mellor admitted another affair, with the married Lady Penelope Cobham, and he was divorced by his wife in 1995.

Ms de Sancha, the daughter of a Spanish father and Swedish mother, says she made around £30,000 for her kiss ‘n tell story - arranged by PR guru Max Clifford - and cites the affair and attendant publicity as the cause of her failed marriage to dental surgeon Clive Hager. They married in 1994 but divorced a couple of years later.

Following the affair she took part in a
TV documentary The Mistress, became agony aunt of Erotic Review 
magazine and imported textiles, rugs and jewellery from India and 
Thailand.

In a newspaper 
interview in 2002 to mark the 10th anniversary of her revelations, Ms de
Sancha confessed that certain sordid details of her affair with Mr 
Mellor were untrue.

Rough patch: Miss de Sancha, wrapped up in a fur coat against the January London weather in notting Hill, still blames the 1992 affair for the collapse of her marriage two years later

Retraction: A decade after her saucy affair with David Mellor was splashed across Britain's newspapers, Miss de Sancha admitted she made up the Chelsea club strip, the spanking and the infamous 'toe sucking'

Back to her roots: Half-Spanish de Sancha visited a tapas restaurant where she enjoyed a Spanish beer and a cigarette with a friend

‘The Chelsea strip was made up,‘ she admitted. ‘I went along with everything at the time. It was almost like I was having an out-of-body experience.’

Asked about the spanking and toesucking, she added: ’It didn’t happen.’

She also addressed the question everyone asks her about the affair.

‘What the hell attracted me to him? That’s a question I sometime ask myself on very rare moments at awkward times in my life.

‘Oh God, absolutely nothing attracted me to him physically. But sometimes you meet somebody who is not an oil painting but you can forget about that and it’s no longer important, it’s who they are and what they’re like inside,’ she explained.

‘The excitement was, to be perfectly frank, from being with somebody who was in a peak position of power.’

Former minister turned opera critic Mr Mellor, who lives with his partner Viscountess Cobham at their Thames-side home in Wapping, remains irked by the false football strip claims.

Giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into media standards last June he said he was ‘sick’ of hearing about them. ‘ It was a total invention.

‘All you will remember about me when I go to my grave is some bloody Chelsea shirt.’

When Antonia de Sancha's affair with David Mellor was revealed in 1992, it kicked off a course of events which contributed to the downfall of John Major's government.

Mr Mellor was backed by the Prime Minister, and repeatedly professed his commitment to his wife in an effort to keep his job as Secretary for National Heritage.

But after it emerged that he had accepted a free holiday from a glamorous socialite whose father was a Palestinian Liberation Official he was finally forced to resign.

The string of scandals eventually led to the break-up of Mr Mellor's marriage to his wife Judith - and had wider repercussions within the Conservative Party.

Other ministers such as Tim Yeo and Steven Norris were also revealed to have had affairs, while rising star Stephen Milligan was found dead in what was believed to be a case of auto-erotic asphyxiation.

The succession of embarrassing incidents was widely held to have undermined Mr Major's 'Back to Basics' campaign which emphasised the importance of family values and other traditional Tory issues.

Couple with a wave of sleaze scandals such as Neil Hamilton allegedly agreeing to ask questions in Parliament in return for a bribe, the affairs played into the hands of Tony Blair's New Labour, which swept to power in 1997 with a landslide election victory.

One of the reasons Mr Mellor's indiscretions became so memorable was the addition of vivid details such as his wearing a Chelsea football shirt during sex, which was splashed over the front page of the Sun, above right.

However, Ms de Sancha later admitted she had made up that particular anecdote.
