A three-year-old was left with only minor injuries after a stray bullet that pierced his crib was stopped dead in its tracks - by his blanket. 

Dylan Hernandez was wrapped up in a comforter inside his family's home in Palmdale, California, on Sunday night when he was hit by a stray bullet that was fired from outside the house.

The bullet went through the wall of the home and into his crib, but it didn't pass through the boy's heavy blanket. 

Bulletproof: Dylan Hernandez, three, only suffered minor injuries when a stray bullet barely struck him after it became lodged in his blanket on Sunday night

The bullet did do some damage so Dylan was brought to the hospital and treated for a gunshot wound.

He suffered a large bruise and small burn, but was allowed to return home on Monday morning. 

The family, who have two other children and have lived at the house for about four years, said they were 'thankful' to have Dylan home safe.

Police believe that three to five rounds were fired during the incident. Another bullet was found lodged in the mattress of the Dylan's parents.

Family friend Mario Morones called the situation 'just mind-blowing', NBC Los Angeles reported.  

'They're humble. They're in church four days out of the week. 

'They raise their kids very well. It's something they never expected to happen.'

He added that Hernandez is 'doing great'. 

'He's home. He's laughing and giggling. He's back to being his normal self.'
