Hosts Brazil opened the World Cup with a 3-1 victory over Croatia with poster boy Neymar bagging a brace - before Oscar rounded off the win with a toe-poked finish.

The technique is used mostly for mere tap-ins but there have been some outrageous and unusual goals scored via a toe-poke down the years.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at five of the best toe-poke finishes... plus we've added in David Nugent's debut goal for England just for good measure.

Toe-poke: Oscar scores Brazil's final goal in a 3-1 win against Croatia in the World Cup opener

1) David Narey, SCOTLAND v Brazil (June 18, 1982)

The World Cup reached Spain in 1982 and Scotland arrived with a fantastic squad.

They came up against a magnificent Brazilian team, however, and looked certain to struggle.

Yet David Narey produced a moment of magic when he toe-poked the ball from the edge of the area.

Brazilian legend Socrates later argued it was not a toe-poke, but whatever it was - it was certainly memorable.

2) Ronaldo, BRAZIL v Turkey (June 3, 2002)

He inspired his nation in 2002 and ultimately won them the World Cup trophy.

Ronaldo scored some spectacular goals in his career, and this one against Turkey was certainly up there with the best.

After weaving inside, he improvised by poking the ball into the far corner from the edge of the area.

Brazilian magic at its very best.

3) Fernando Torres, CHELSEA v Newcastle (August 25, 2012)

Torres has seriously struggled at Chelsea since his Â£50million move from Liverpool but there have been flashes of the old magic there.

This finish against Newcastle United in the Premier League optimises what makes Torres so special.

Eden Hazard crossed the ball to Torres won ran on to it and smashed it with a toe-poke past Tim Krul. Bullet.

Finish: Fernando Torres scores for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge against Newcastle in the Premier League

4) Ronaldinho, BARCELONA v Chelsea (March 7, 2005)

At his best Ronaldinho was simply a marvel to behold.

In the Champions League in 2005 he lit up Stamford Bridge with a marvellous double against Chelsea.

For the first of those goals he picked the ball up over 20 yards out, dummied a group of defenders before poking the ball into the bottom left-hand corner.

Simply breathtaking.

5) Sergio Aguero, MANCHESTER CITY v Norwich (December 3, 2011)

This Argentinian just loves scoring, and Norwich City were his victims on this occasion.

Crowded inside the box with several defenders, it looked impossible to score.

But after jinking from side to side he prodded the ball home.

Great improvisation.

AND... David Nugent, England v Andorra (March 28, 2007)

This list would not be complete without Nugent's (sort of) memorable strike for England against Andorra.

With the visitors already leading 2-0, Jermaine Defoe slotted the ball past the goalkeeper and the ball was trickling towards the line.

The ball was already half-way over the line, but Nugent opportunistically ran over and toe-poked it in... just to make sure.

An absolute screamer.
