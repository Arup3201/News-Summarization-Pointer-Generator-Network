Sometimes, mother really doesn't know best.

The mom of a seven-year old boy from Virginia dressed him up for Halloween night in a Ku Klux Klan costume.

Jessica Black, from Craigsville, says her little boy, Jackson who is seven actually asked if he could also dress as a member of the white supremacist group, so she decided to make him the costume.

Ms Black says it's a 'family tradition'.

'My brother dressed up as a member of the KKK when he was in Kindergarten and when he was 13,' said Ms Black.

A reporter from WHSV asked the little Jackson why he decided to wear the controversial costume but it was clear from his answer that he did not know the historical signifiance of the outfit or how offensive the clothing can be.

His mother didn't appear to know any better, justifying her actions by pointing the blame squarely in her sons' direction.

'I did tell him that if you do it, you know there's going to be people talking about you. There's going to be people saying bad things about you when you do wear it,' she advised.

Neighbors say they were shocked when they saw Jackson Black's costume and that his mother should bare full responsibility.

'I just think it's really sad that a kid is being taught that. That young, because they don't know any better. You don't hear that much about it,' said Wendi Sprouse, 'That little boy roaming around as a Klansman. It's not okay and you're offending a lot of people.'

When asked where he learned of the costume, Jackson said he saw it in the movie Fried Green Tomatoes.

Ms Brown sees nothing wrong with the costume for one night a year and he son appears to happy also despite the controversy she's stirring up.

She reaffirmed her position by revealing the Klu Klux Klan still exists in Craigsville, Virgnia.

'It's suppose to be white with white. Black with black. Man with woman and all of that. That's what the KKK stands for. The KKK every year, raises money to donate to the St. Jude's,' she protested.

Ms.Black says she has since received several threats via Facebook, because of the photo of Jackson that has been circulating onilne.
