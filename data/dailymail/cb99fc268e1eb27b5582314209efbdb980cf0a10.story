One of Britain’s highest paid executives prompted outrage last night by insisting that his £1million basic salary is 'very low’.

Sir Martin Sorrell, head of advertising giant WPP, rejected criticism of executive pay in the wake of a study showing it rose by almost 50 per cent in the past year.

David Cameron described the huge increases commanded by bosses at a time when ordinary workers have had their incomes squeezed as 'disturbing’.

And Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was a 'slap in the face’ for employees, seizing on the astonishing rise as evidence that tax cuts for the low paid should take priority over scrapping the 50p top tax rate.

But Sir Martin, 66, said his bumper income, which rose by 83 per cent to £4.2million last year, was fully justified and was mostly linked to the firm’s performance.

He added that he considered his basic salary, of just over £1million, to be 'very low’.

But his comments astonished MPs and 
infuriated union leaders. Labour education spokesman Karen Buck 
described the huge rise in executive pay as 'grotesque’, adding: 'What 
planet do these people live on?’

Deborah
 Hargreaves, chair of the High Pay Commission which is looking into 
executives’ remuneration, said the performance-related pay deals enjoyed
 by executives 'don’t really work’.

Commenting
 on the study by the research group Income Data Services, she added: 'I 
think it is very hard to justify these sorts of pay increases when we 
have seen companies’ share prices go down, profits down, companies 
laying off staff, and when average wages are going up 1 or 2 per cent, 
not even keeping up with price rises.’

But in an interview with the Daily Mail, Sir Martin angrily defended his bumper pay packet.

He
 said: 'The only planet I am living on is looking at our company in 
terms of the competition – that’s the planet. We need to maintain a 
competitive position. The UK only accounts for 12 per cent of our 
business. We have more Brazilians, Russians, and Indians than we have 
Americans and Brits.

'In 2009 it was a tough year for us and compensation across the board fell. In 2010 we delivered record profit.

'People are not distinguishing 
between fixed pay and incentive pay. I don’t sell my stock. Other 
people, including our competitors, do. The value of the business has 
grown from £1million to £8.5billion over its life.’

However, there was little sympathy for him among ordinary workers outside WPP’s offices in West London last night.

One
 of the firm’s delivery men, who declined to give his name, said: 'To 
say that his salary is not very much is really insensitive. I’m not 
earning that much, no one is.’

Julian Chambers, a street cleaner working next to the building, said: 'I work here every day on minimum wage and I work weekends just to pay the bills. It’s been really hard even finding work during the past few years. It just shows how out of touch he must be.’

Yesterday’s report by the IDS showed pay among directors of Britain’s FTSE 100 companies had risen by 49 per cent last year. It now averages £3.8million.

The Prime Minister said the increase was 'not okay’ when millions were facing pay freezes and called for 'transparency, proper accountability and a sense of responsibility from boardrooms’.

And Bob Crow, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers’ union, said: 'The same top bosses demanding wage restraint and attacks on workers’ rights on the shop floor have been caught stuffing their own pockets in the boardroom.’
