A mother-of-two says having a baby saved her life because she found a lump in her breast while breastfeeding.

Gill Thomson, 37, noticed a fast-growing lump in her breast five months after her son Jack was born.

Initially, she suspected it was simply a blocked milk duct and didn’t consider the possibility it could be a tumour, even when her GP suggested screening as a precaution.

But Mrs Thomson, from Edinburgh, received the devastating diagnosis after being referred to a specialist breast cancer centre.

The communications manager, who has now made a full recovery, said: ‘I feel really lucky because doctors think there was a very good chance I had the cancer while I was pregnant.

‘Obviously it was a massive shock. It’s overwhelming to think that if it wasn’t for Jack, it might not have been caught so quickly and it might have been too late for me.

‘I was petrified, thinking how am I going to look after my children while dealing with cancer?’ It’s natural that you fear the worst.’

After the joy of giving birth to Jack, now two, the cancer diagnosis came as a terrible shock to Mrs Thomson, husband David and their daughter Maisie, five.

Doctors at Edinburgh’s Western General Hospital suspected that hormones had accelerated the tumour’s growth, making it bigger but easier to detect.

The diagnosis forced Mrs Thomson to stop breastfeeding while she underwent a series of tests before starting her treatment.

And she had to leave her family for 24 hours to protect the children from the possibility of radiation after being injected with a special dye to see if the cancer had spread.

She said: ‘Five months after giving birth to my baby boy, we found ourselves in a small consulting room hearing the life-changing news that I would begin chemotherapy in less than two weeks.

‘It sounds really melodramatic, but having to stay that night at my parents’ house before finding out if it had spread was definitely the hardest part.

‘I ended up having to turn all of the photos of the kids face down because it was just so heart-breaking.

‘You almost feel like you have let them down, which I know is stupid. I was worrying what they were going to do if the worse-case scenario happened.’

Within a fortnight, Mrs Thomson was on a trial of a strong chemotherapy drug, which caused her immune system to weaken and her hair to fall out.

But the morning after her first session, the family were shattered by more misfortune when Mr Thomson was knocked off his bike in a hit-and-run incident.

The accident left him on crutches with Mrs Thomson having to take up the role of childcare - all while suffering the ill-effects of chemotherapy.

She said: ‘It was just ridiculous - our family truly have been through hell and back. At that point I remember thinking “how could things get any worse?”’

Despite Mrs Thomson’s early treatment, the tumour continued to grow, and she had a lumpectomy before she continued with chemotherapy.

She was put through daily radiotherapy for five weeks early in 2013 before being given the all-clear a year ago.

Health professionals recommend that she remained on medication to suppress her levels of oestrogen, a hormone known to encourage growth in some breast cancers.

She will go through the menopause early, leaving her unable to have more children.

But the mother-of-two said it was a price that she was more than willing to pay for the chance of a long life with her family.

She said: ‘Breastfeeding made me a lot more aware than I’d usually be and probably helped me to notice sooner that I had quite a big lump.

‘I’m just so glad I got it checked or there could have been a very different outcome.

‘The kids have both been amazing and - with mine and David’s family - they have all really helped me through a tough time.

‘I’m just so happy to be at the other end and be all-clear from cancer now. I know not everyone’s as lucky as me but it may not always be the worse-case scenario.

‘I want people to know that you can get over this and there’s so much support out there.’

Gillian Smith, director of the Royal College of Midwives, said Mrs Thomson’s story showed how important it was for health professionals not to be complacent with changes to women’s breasts when lactating.

She said: ‘We have to be careful that we don’t assume that every lump and bump women have is a blocked milk duct.

‘It’s absolutely the right route that everyone’s taken here - if there’s anything suspicious at all, don’t make an assumption, make sure it gets checked out.’
