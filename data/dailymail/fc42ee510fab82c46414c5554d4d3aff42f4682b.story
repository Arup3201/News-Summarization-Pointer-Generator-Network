He has been riding on a wave of euphoria since the success of this summer’s Olympics.

But Sebastian Coe has revealed his hidden heartache after losing his mother to a rare degenerative brain disease.

The former champion runner – who claimed he worked 19-hour days in the run-up to the London Games – said he owed much of his success to the woman who first taught him to ‘balance’ his lifestyle.

Angela Coe died in 2005 aged 75 from progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP, an incurable brain condition that affects fewer than six in 100,000 people.

Hosting a fundraising event for the PSP Association on Tuesday, Lord Coe said watching her health decline in the five years before her death was ‘hideous’.

He said: ‘My mother was what the empire was made of. So she was quite stoic when she was diagnosed.

‘But it is a pretty hideous disease. The last few years were hideous.

‘First of all, she slowed up, which I guess you are allowed to do in your early 70s. But it was quite dramatic.

‘This was a woman who was playing football with her grandchildren, reading five books a day and just on top of her game.

‘After we first noticed her symptoms, we spent a year and a half going to pillar to post to specialists who didn’t know enough to identify the disease.

‘It was a big burden on my family and on my father, who was a lot older than her and having to deal with his own frailties as well as become a full-time carer.’

Coached by his father Peter, Lord Coe won two Olympic middle-distance gold medals between 1980 and 1986.

But the former runner said his mother played just as significant a role in his future success by teaching him to manage his workload.

He said: ‘The London Olympics has been most days of the week including Saturdays and Sundays five until midnight. I mean five in the morning until midnight.

‘I have always been very good at being able to structure my time. My mother had a huge influence on me. My dad was my coach. He was a hugely influential figure.

‘But my mum was critical in getting me to recognise very early on that although what I was doing was pretty serious, quite selfish and probably to most people pretty obsessive, there actually was more to life than running quickly twice round a track.

‘So she sort of kept the balance there.’

He added: ‘She was a fixture around running tracks.

'Whenever we were racing or training in or around London, she would end up cooking for the other athletes, including Steve Ovett and Daley Thompson.

‘She was a massive influence on everything I did.’

Lord Coe will take on another high-pressure role next month, when he is elected chairman of the British Olympic Association.

Despite taking just a ‘few days’ of holiday since the Olympics, he denied being addicted to work, saying: ‘I don’t think I am a workaholic. I prefer to keep busy. It is better than the alternative.

‘What I am really quite keen to hold on to is a little more weekend time.

'The thing about the Games is that weekends and weekdays tend to meld into one.’
