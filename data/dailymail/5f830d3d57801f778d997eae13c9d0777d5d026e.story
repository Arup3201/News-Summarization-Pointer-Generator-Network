It's a hard job, but someone's got to do it.

Although in this case, most people would probably jump at the chance, for this lucky Californian gets paid $93,000 just to have as much fun as possible.

Andrew Smith won a contest to become Chief Funster in the Australian state of New South Wales as part of a promotional event for the area.

He now earns a living by skydiving, driving around with The Stig, hanging out with skateboarder Tony Hawk and abseiling the spectacular Blue Mountains in Australia.
