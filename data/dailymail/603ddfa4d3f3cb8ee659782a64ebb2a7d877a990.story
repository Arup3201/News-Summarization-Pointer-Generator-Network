When she moved to the countryside seven years ago, she adopted a menagerie of animals and threw herself into rural pursuits.

But now that Billie Piper has returned to the city, it seems she has found a new hobby.

The 32-year-old actress and her husband Laurence Fox have started attending hot yoga classes, which take place in temperatures of 40c.

And the pair are breaking a sweat in star-studded company, with actress Helena Bonham Carter attending the same sessions.

Miss Piper’s love of the ‘hot yoga’ workouts was revealed by Fox in an interview in which he lifted the lid on family life and marriage.

The 36-year-old actor – best known for playing James Hathaway in long-running drama Lewis – told Woman magazine: ‘I’ve just started exercising – to stop my mind wandering, more than anything.

‘Me and the missus do a bit of 'Bikram' yoga twice a week. Helena Bonham Carter was there the other day. I said hello and then realised I didn’t know her.’

Madonna, Coleen Rooney, Andy Murray and Gwyneth Paltrow are also known to be fans of Bikram, which is based on the more common hatha yoga but performed in sweltering temperatures and 40 per cent humidity.

Devotees claim that not only does it leave them stronger and more flexible, it also helps them shed weight fast.

Just a few years ago, Miss Piper insisted her fitness regime involved nothing more than running around after sons Winston, now five, and Eugene, two.

Shortly after Winston was born, she declared: ‘Exercise is the most boring thing in the world. It’s boring and hellish.’

In another interview, she said: ‘Having a child is the best way to keep trim as it completely changes your metabolism. I just don’t stop.’

Former Doctor Who star Miss Piper and her husband recently swapped their £825,000 cottage in a secluded West Sussex village for a four-bedroom home in North London which they bought for £1.7million last year.

They moved to the countryside in 2007 and threw themselves into rural life, buying a horse called Chutney, two pigs named Boris and Barack, and three chickens.

But with their careers flourishing in the capital, they decided to return. Miss Piper recently starred in Great Britain at London’s National Theatre and played an Irish immigrant in Sky Atlantic drama Penny Dreadful.

Fox is busy recording an album and made his own West End appearance in Strangers on a Train at the Gielgud Theatre.
