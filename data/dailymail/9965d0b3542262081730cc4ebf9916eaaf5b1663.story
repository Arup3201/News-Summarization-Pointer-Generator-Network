Horrific pictures today revealed the scale of the ongoing slaughter in Syria after government troops regained control of a strategic border town from rebel fighters.

The graphic images purported to show the corpses of rebels killed during the three-week battle over the town of Qusair, which was captured by Bashar Al Assad's forces today.

The news comes as a British official insisted there is a 'growing body of persuasive evidence' that the regime has been using chemical weapons against its rebel opponents.

It is believed that Assad's government has acquired such weapons, including the deadly nerve gas sarin, from foreign allies such as Russia and Iran.

Horror: This image purports to show rebel fighters killed by the Syrian army during the battle for control of Qusair

State television reported this 
morning that Assad's troops, backed by the Islamist militia Hezbollah, 
had seized control of Qusair from the rebels who had held it for more 
than two years.

The government claimed to have 'restored security and peace' and defeated 'terrorist networks' in the town.

The
 loss of Qusair is likely to come as a major blow to the rebels, as the 
town was crucial to its ability to smuggle supplies into Syria from 
Lebanon.

Images 
broadcast by state-run TV channels appeared to show the bodies of rebels
 lying around the city, and reporters claimed that the fighting had 
stopped after the government's declaration of victory.

Yesterday
 officials from both France and the UK said that tests had proven the 
use of chemical weapons as part of the country's civil war.

Foreign
 Minister Laurent Fabius said the presence of sarin was detected by 
researchers in Paris, adding that it had been used 'several times', 
including at least once by the regime.

France,
 which is pushing to arm rebels fighting Assad's army, said the use of 
the gas was in breach of all international protocols.

The British Foreign Office said that its own tests had independently confirmed the use of sarin and other chemical agents.

A spokesman for David Cameron today 
called on an independent United Nations investigation to establish the 
'full facts' about the use of chemical weapons in the conflict, and 
urged Assad to co-operate with the inspectors appointed by UN secretary 
general Ban Ki-moon.

'There is a growing body of 
persuasive evidence that the regime has used and continues to use 
chemical weapons, but there is a need, through the UN, to establish the 
full facts,' he said.

'The room for doubt continues to 
diminish, but we remain very much of the view that what we need is for 
this independent UN investigation to get to the full facts.'

The Prime Minister's spokesman 
refused to confirm that the findings were a 'game-changer', but he 
added: 'We have been very clear that President Assad has no future. 
Assad must go.'

Civil war: The battle for Qusair comes after Western officials revealed chemical weapons had been used

Syria began building its chemical weapons programme after a series of military defeats by Israel, its fierce regional rival which has a stockpile of nuclear arms.

Because the Damascus regime did not have the technological capability to make its own nerve agents, it turned to allies abroad for help.

Iran, Russia and Egypt are believed to be among the countries which provided assistance with Syria's chemical weapons facilities.

The government also imported chemicals which can be used for both civilian and military purposes from European manufacturers.

To reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers, Damascus set up an agency for military research which is said to be far more advanced than any other scientific facility in the country.

Photographs have already been produced of victims including young children dying from the chemicals.

Sarin is odourless, and so hard to detect, often leaving people with no idea that they were have been exposed to the gas.

Within a few minutes, victims experience runny nose, tightness in the chest, and pupil constriction.

Then they have difficulty breathing, 
get sick, and start to drool before they lose control of all their 
bodily functions, begin twitching and ultimately suffocate in a series 
of convulsive spasms.

'It is a horrendous death, and one 
that the international community cannot allow,' said a foreign ministry 
source in the French capital.

Both Assad and the Syrian rebels have 
accused each other of using chemical weapons, but this is the first 
solid evidence of 'localised use', said Mr Fabius.

Barack Obama has previously warned that if Assad's forces are found to have deployed chemical weapons, they will cross a 'red line' and trigger a more robust response from the U.S. government, which has so far been reluctant to become too involved in the civil war.

March was the bloodiest month of the 
conflict so far, with more than 6,000 people killed, including more than
 500 women and children.

Some 70,000 people are thought to have
 died since the uprising began in March 2011 as part of the Arab Spring 
revolution across the Middle East and North Africa. Hundreds of 
thousands more have been wounded, imprisoned and made homeless.

Sarin was first developed in Nazi Germany in 1938 by two scientists who were trying to create a stronger pesticide.

When its potential for chemical 
warfare was realised during the Second World War, the Germans started 
mass-producing it, but it was never used.

NATO listed sarin as a standard 
chemical weapon in the 1950s, but it was not used properly until 1988 
when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein used it to wipe out some 5000 people 
in the Kurdish city of Haljaba, in northern Iraq.

They all died over the course of two days when some 20 aircraft dropped the chemicals on the town.

Sarin gas was also said to have been 
used during the Gulf War in 2004, with the west using it as evidence of 
the banned weapons of mass destruction the American and British 
governments claimed Iraq possessed.

Mr Fabius said: 'These tests show the 
presence of sarin in various samples in our possession. France is 
certain that sarin gas was used several times in Syria in limited 
areas.'

Mr Fabius said that the test results 
had been handed to the United Nations because chemical weapons are 
banned by international law.

It came as a UN report stated that 
there were 'reasonable grounds' to suggest that chemical weapons were 
being used in Syria. Mr Fabius would not state whether the Sarin had 
been used by the Syrian Army, or by the rebels.
