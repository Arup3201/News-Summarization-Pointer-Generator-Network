A company director has been charged with gross negligence manslaughter after a little girl was crushed by an electronic gate.

Six-year-old Semelia Campbell died on June 28, 2010, when the motorised gate closed on her as she played near her home in Manchester.

Today the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed it had authorised the charging of Kristian Kearns, 40, from Stockport,  the director of a company which automated the gate.

He has been charged with unlawfully killing Semelia by gross negligence manslaughter and will appear before Manchester magistrates on March 12.

Alison Norton, specialist prosecutor handling special crime in the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'I have carefully considered all the available evidence in this tragic case, in which six-year-old Semelia Campbell died on 28 June 2010 after becoming caught in and crushed by an electric gate in the housing development where she lived.

'I have now concluded there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to charge Kristian Kearns, director of the company that automated the gate, with gross negligence manslaughter.'

Ms Norton added: 'I once again extend my deepest sympathies to the family of Semelia Campbell.'

Semelia was trapped in the 450kg gate as she followed a car from a residents carpark.

She screamed 'help me, help me' when her mother ran over to save her daughter.

Judith Gilroy  tried in vain to free Semelia who was pinned against a brick post.

Ms Gilroy tried pressing the electronic button to open the gate, and also tried to use a remote control, but neither worked.

Commenting through her solicitor, Joanne Berry at Pannone, Ms Gilroy said today: 'The loss of Semelia has been devastating for the whole family.

'We are relieved that charges have been brought, as we are keen to see justice for Semelia.'

Ms Berry, a specialist in serious injury, added: 'We are pleased that the charge of gross negligence manslaughter has been brought following the lengthy investigation into Semelia’s death.

'We hope the charges raise awareness of the dangers connected with these types of gates and their installation and that the prosecution will help prevent any further deaths.'

Police were called to Maine Road, Manchester, shortly before 7.40pm.

On arrival officers discovered Semelia had been crushed between the gate and a retaining wall and found the electronic gate was stuck fast in the closed position.

After considerable efforts by the emergency services Semelia was freed and taken to hospital.She never regained consciousness and later died.

The schoolgirl was playing with her friend Jadon Skeritt, also aged six, near the gate when she became trapped.

The gate, which costs £4000, was made by the Stockport based Cheshire Gate and Automation Limited.

Another little girl was killed in similar tragic circumstances just five days later in Bridgend, South Wales.

Five-year-old Karolina Maria Golabek died after becoming trapped in an automatic sliding gate on July 3.

Earlier in 2010, developer Faulkner Gates Ltd, of Romsey, Hampshire, was fined £80,000 and ordered to pay £40,000 legal costs after it admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act.

It was prosecuted after nine-year-old Jason Keet was crushed to death by a set of electronic gates in Poole, Dorset.

His mother, Samantha Whittle, and his sister, Rhiannon, aged 12 at the time, witnessed the horrific scene outside Jason’s grandparents’ flat in Branksome Park.
