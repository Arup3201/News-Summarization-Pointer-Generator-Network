More than 300 former students of a prestigious high school have signed an open letter demanding that an invitation for federal cabinet minister Scott Morrison to speak at a fundraising event is withdrawn.

Published in full on the blog of former student Danny Yau, the petition is addressed to Sydney Boys High School's Old Boys Union which is asked to 'immediately rescind the invitation so as to spare the organisation, and the school itself, the embarrassment of being seen to celebrate the achievements of a man who has so flagrantly disregarded human rights'.

The former Immigration Minister is scheduled to attend the cocktail fundraiser on April 15 as a guest speaker.

Over 300 former students of the prestigious Sydney Boys High School have demanded for Scott Morrison's invitation to speak at the school's fundraiser be withdrawn 

He and a number of other former students will present speeches which reflect on 'how their lives were shaped by their experiences at Sydney Boys High School,' the invitation reads.

It adds that the $75 ticket fee will 'go towards the construction of the Governors' Centre and to support the on-going activities of the Old Boys Union'.

However Mr Morrison's possible attendance has enraged some former students of the school who deplore his role in advocating Australia's detention centres.

'In his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Morrison was at best complicit, and at worst the chief protagonist, in advocating offshore immigration detention policies that violate the United Nations Convention against Torture,' the letter reads.

The open letter, signed by the Old Boys and addressed to the Old Boys Union, slammed the former Immigration Minister's role in advocating Australia's detention centres

Sydney Boys High School: 'Immediately rescind the invitation so as to spare the organisation, and the school itself, the embarrassment of being seen to celebrate the achievements of a man who has so flagrantly disregarded human rights,' it read

It goes on to say that despite the signatories supporting 'free political discourse, dissent and contrasting opinions', this matter 'is not a question of restricting freedom of speech, but instead reflects the desire not to tacitly endorse the actions of a man who has demonstrated callous disregard for human rights.

'It is cruel and insensitive for the Union to laud this man's connection to the school, its graduates, and their families.'

The petition mentions the UN's and the Australian Human Rights Commission's condemnation of Australia's Regional Processing Centres which have been found to violate the human rights of asylum seekers.

Amongst those who signed the letter were former Supreme Court judge Hal Wootten (right), renowned journalist and documentary maker John Pilger (left) and about 30 former Sydney Girls High School students

'We note that the Convention against Torture proscribes torture as an international crime, and calls on all signatory states to prosecute or extradite individuals who have directly perpetrated or otherwise authorised torture,' it adds.

Amongst those who signed the letter were former Supreme Court judge Hal Wootten, renowned journalist and documentary maker John Pilger and about 30 former Sydney Girls High School students.

Mr Morrison's response to the highly critical petition was to assure he would not politicise the fundraiser.

'Everyone is entitled to their opinion, including those I disagree with. That is what I learnt at Sydney Boys High School,' he said, according to Fairfax.
