From headgear to hemline, a woman’s outfit at Royal Ascot is strictly prescribed.

Such is the gentility of the racing festival that dresses must be of ‘modest length’, with straps that are not too narrow.

But with no rule banning tattoos, even the event’s stringent fashion police cannot do much about extravagant body art.

Denise Sanchez was one of several race-goers showing off their inkings on the first day of the festival yesterday.

Stunning: Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins looked wonderful in orange silk and was joined by Bollywood favourite, Aishwarya Rai, on day one of Royal Ascot

Lovely: Gary Lineker's wife Danielle was a picture in pale pink lace, while Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears opted for one of her trademark print dresses

The 41-year-old care practitioner, 
from Cornwall, has images stretching all the way down her left leg and 
arm, including a bear, a naked woman clutching her knees and a pack of 
cards.

Miss Sanchez 
said: ‘I’m proud of my tattoos. I see it as the colour of my skin, so if
 they were banned, it would be like discriminating against a black 
person.’

In recent years, 
it has become a less-than-stylish affair with fake tan, bizarre hats and
 micro minis becoming the norm. But two years after imposing strict 
sartorial rules, it seems that Royal Ascot has become a contender in the
 style stakes once more.

Kim Sears, girlfriend of 
multi-millionaire tennis star Andy Murray, made a rather quieter 
statement by rejecting a designer outfit in favour of the high street.

Indeed, in her £155 Whistles dress, 
LK Bennett shoes and simple hat, the  25-year-old seemed to have taken 
some style tips from the Duchess of Cambridge.

Danielle Lineker and Katherine Jenkins both 
seemed to be celebrating big wins from the balcony on the first day of 
the famous race meet

Another racegoer leading the charge 
was Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins who looked stunning in a sunny 
bright orange dress and matching orange and hot pink fascinator by 
milliner, Phillip Treacy.

Her
 daring choice was echoed by many of her fellow race goers, most of whom
 plumped for bright hues - perhaps to make up for the miserable squalls 
of rain that sent many scurrying for shelter.

Jenkins
 was joined by Earl Spencer and his Canadian wife, Karen, who looked 
beautiful in a low key cream dress and Girls Aloud singer, Sarah 
Harding, who picked a slick black dress teamed with a showstopping gold 
necklace.

Also on hand to get Royal Ascot off to a
 flying start was Bollywood megastar, Aishwarya Rai, who chose a subtle 
monochrome ensemble, topped with a pretty black and white floral hat.

Gary
 Lineker's wife, Danielle, looked particularly beautiful in a stunning 
pale pink 1930s style frock teamed with a white picture hat, while Andy 
Murray's other half, Kim Sears, plumped for trademark prints teamed with
 a pair of delicate lemon shoes.

In the paddock, a flock of beautifully dressed women in a array of stunning rainbow
 hues were drawing admiring glances from male race goers, although the 
odd shivering girl in a too-short skirt could also be seen. Hats were big and bold, with floral 
motifs spotted 
adorning headwear up and down the course.

Racegoer
 Florence Claridge wore an 
artificial pink fuchsia plant on her head complete with dozens of blooms
 and a matching shocking pink dress. She said: 'You have to be a trooper
 to wear this, it's quite heavy - but I've been coming here for 25 
years.'

Fellow guest, 
Jackie St Clair chose an enormous pink rose made by milliner Bundle 
MacLaren. She said: 'It's made from layers of silk and is fabulous. I've
 been 
coming to Ascot for 31 years. I like the fashion, the Pimm's and the 
quintessential Englishness of it.'

Mono mania: Along with Bollywood star Aishwarya 
Rai, both Countess Spencer and Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding plumped 
for low key black and white combos

Colourful:
 Guests arriving at day one of this year's Royal Ascot appeared to have 
taken organisers' stern sartorial advice firmly to heart

Striking: Londoner Carrie Colbert and pretty Jackie St Clair (right) wowed fellow racegoers with their stunning floral head wear

No
 blooms for the boys! This unlucky racegoer was ejected by Royal Ascot's
 style police for attempting to sneak through the gates sporting a 
floral headpiece

Blooming marvellous: Race goer Florence Claridge from Dover looked radiant in a gigantic hat inspired by beautiful fuchsia bushes

Crimson classic: The Tootsie Rollers perform on day one of Royal Ascot, dressed in vintage style red dresses teamed with matching fascinators

Hats you win... Blooms have proved to be Ascot's hottest hat trend so far, although for some stylish guests, less was clearly more

Cool couples: The wife of Genesis guitarist Mike Rutherford looked fresh and pretty in pale blue while Ruth Langsford (right), wife of Eamonn Holmes, was lovely in lilac

Former Channel 4 racing pundit, John McCririck, was
 on typically bombastic form as he wandered in, trademark bowler hat 
and cigar firmly in place.

Like fellow female guests, McCririck 
embraced the floral theme, courtesy of a huge cabbage rose in his 
buttonhole, although his wife, in a pretty pansy print dress, had the 
edge in the style stakes.

Also looking good was Ruth Langsford, wife of veteran Sky News presenter, Eamonn Holmes, who looked radiant in a pretty lilac dress and cream picture hat.

Nearby, Ascot's phalanx of dress code
 enforcers - tasked with ensuring straps are at least 2.5 inches wide 
and skirts are modest - watched beadily, while surveying passing guests.

And not everyone made the cut. One unfortunate racegoer - a gentleman sporting a large floral headpiece - fell foul of the Royal Ascot fashion police and was sent home to change.

The Queen, joined by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, made a grand entrance processing along the course in a carriage.

Although today's races didn't feature a thoroughbred from the Queen's own stables, her filly, Estimate, is one of the favourites for Thursday's Gold Cup -  a race the Queen would dearly love to win.

In the foreword to the official programme, the Queen wrote: 'I was fortunate enough too own a winner at last year's royal meeting, so I know what a thrill it is to have success at this wonderful racecourse whether you are a trainer, jockey, or one of the many hard-working stable staff associated with every runner.'

Also in the running for the Gold Cup is last year's winner, Colour Vision, and 2010 champion, Rites of Passage.

Today's races include the Queen Anne Stakes, expected to be carried off by American horse, Animal Kingdom, followed by the King's Stand Stakes, which will see South African colt, Shea Shea, start the race in pole position with bookmakers.

Body art: Claire Brockett sported a glittery dress while her friend Denise Sanchez showed off her tattoos outside the Royal Enclosure

Cheerful:
 It takes more than a drop of rain to make veteran racing pundit, John 
McCririck, lose his good humour - just ask former employer Channel 4

Opulent: Racegoer, Anneka Tanaka-Svenska, sports big pink blooms combined with ropes of pearls on her  utterly spectacular hat

Day out: A trio of neatly dressed racegoers make their way towards the entrance carrying a pair of traditional wicker picnic baskets

There's always one! This lady's yellow dress is breaking more than one style rule (left), while Londoner Elisabeth Dana shows how it's done with a chinoiserie cloche hat

Traditionally dressed greencoats were on hand to assist guests throughout the course (left) and liquid lunches were the order of the day

Dapper: Top hatted, dark suited gentlemen check out the form guide ahead of the Queen Anne Stakes - the first race of the Royal Ascot meet

Last minute tweaks: A trio of unlucky groundsmen are tasked with making sure that no trace of manure remains on the pristine grass of the  racecourse

All set: The Royal Ascot racecourse has been readied for the five day racing event, complete with boxes of cheerful red geraniums and manicured grassy areas
