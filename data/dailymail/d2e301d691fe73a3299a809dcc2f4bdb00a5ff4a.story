Union boss Len McCluskey has laid out a £63billion shopping list of left-wing policies he says Labour must adopt or lose millions in funding.

The Unite general secretary – dubbed Red Len – warned Labour faces bankruptcy as a result of Ed Miliband’s attempts to water down union influence on the party.

And he said the Labour leader had to be ‘bold’ and reverse the coalition’s benefit reforms, halt spending cuts and borrowing billions to build 1million extra homes.

Demands: Unite general secretary Len McCluskey set out his policy wish list, including opposing spending cuts and benefit reforms, which he says Labour must adopt

Pressure has mounted on Mr Miliband over his links to the unions, after allegations emerged that Unite had paid for people to join Labour without their knowledge to influence candidate selection.

David Cameron has repeatedly accused Labour allowing unions to 'buy' the party;s policies, candidates and even Mr Miliband's leadership victory over his brother David.

Unite has given Labour more than £8.4million in funding since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010.

Earlier this month he announced plans to change the way that union members give money to the Labour party.

Mr Miliband said union political levy payers would have to ‘opt in’ to join Labour individually, instead of being signed up automatically.

But several union leaders have warned there is little enthusiasm among their members for joining Labour and the plan could cost the party millions.

Mr McCluskey said it was ‘a really good, morally defensible idea’ but in practice it could prove disastrous for Labour, with barely 10 per cent of Unite’s 3million political levy payers signing up;.

‘The gamble and the danger is whether it will bankrupt the Labour party,’ he said in an interview with the Guardian.

There was clearly a danger that Mr Miliband's plan ‘could fall flat on its face and fail’.

He added: ‘There is no doubt we would have to work very hard because our members are not queuing to join the Labour party, or be associated with the Labour party. That is really Ed's challenge.’

With the threat of millions of pounds of automatic payments disappearing from Labour coffers, Mr McCluskey set out his demands for a new policy agenda opposing spending cuts and welfare reforms.

He said Mr Miliband ‘has got to give ordinary trade unionists reasons to want to be associated with the Labour party’.

‘And that really is about policy. He knows within this next 12 months he has got to start out with policy that gives hope to people and something different from the austerity programme that the government is pursuing that engenders nothing but fear.’

He called for the repeal of cuts to housing benefit for unused spare rooms – dubbed the bedroom tax by Labour, the reversal of the benefits cap which means no family can receive more than £26,000 and an end to ‘austerity spending’.

The end of the spare room subsidy is saving £465million-a-year while the benefit cap is expected to save £185million.

It means those two policies alone would require an extra £3.25billion in extra borrowing over the course of the next parliament.

Mr McCluskey also called for 1million extra homes to be built, which Tories claim could cost £60billion.

A Conservative source said: 'This proves that nothing’s changed. Len McCluskey's Unite union still has total control over a weak Ed Miliband. Len McCluskey can still buy Labour’s candidates, buy their policies, and pick their leader.

‘In a single article today the Unite boss is demanding that Labour borrow £63.2 billion over the five years, meaning higher taxes and higher bills. It’s hardworking people who would pay the price.'

Mr McCluskey added: ‘Miliband has got a real task on his hands. The prize of being prime minister is within his grasp ... but he has to be bold - and not just on issues that ordinary working people don't give a toss about like the union block vote.’

At Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, Mr Cameron stepped up his attacks on Labour's union links.

Mr Miliband accused the PM of caving in to big tobacco after ditching plans for plain cigarette packaging.

It emerged new Tory election guru Lynton Crosby counts tobacco giant Philip Morris International among the clients of his lobbying firm.

But Mr Cameron hit back at the Labour leader: 'If he wants a lobbying scandal, why does he not try the fact that the trade unions buy his policies, buy his candidates and even bought and paid for his leadership?

'That is a scandal, and he should do something about it.'
