Protesters have today defaced a controversial painting that draws attention to South African President Jacob Zuma's genitals and his reputation for promiscuity.

Two men wielding cans of red and black paint walked into Johannesburg's Goodman gallery and daubed an X over the president's groin before smearing paint over his face.

The painting by Brett Murray entitled 'The Spear' has been on display since early this month, but made the news only last week when it came to the attention of South Africa's governing African National Congress party.

Zuma filed an urgent application at the South Gauteng High Court for an order to have the portrait removed from the gallery and photographs of it taken off the City Press newspaper website.

Both the gallery and the newspaper refused on the grounds it would be censorship. The matter was set to be heard today.

Zuma claims portrait, which shows him fully clothed but with his genitals exposed, infringed on his constitutional rights to dignity and privacy.

Zuma said he felt 'shocked, personally offended and violated' when he saw a copy of The Spear for the first time.

He said the portrait depicted him as a 'a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect'.

Iman Rappetti, a reporter for a South African TV channel who was in the Goodman Gallery when the men struck, said: 'Now it's completely and utterly destroyed.'

Her channel showed footage of a man in a suit painting a red X over the president's genital area and then his face.

Next a man in a hoodie used his hands to rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting. Rapetti said the men were detained by gallery staff and police arrived later to take them away.

Rappetti said she initially thought the first man was part of a performance art piece, and that staff at the well-known gallery also were slow to react.

The Goodman, which had said in a statement a day earlier that it was stepping up security, refused to comment Tuesday and closed the gallery as reporters and passers-by gathered outside its gate.

The gallery's attorney, Greg Palmer, said they are going to file a charge for malicious damage to property. He said they did not know who the two men were who defaced the painting.

'The gallery has closed and they feel that their security is sufficient,' he said.

Judge Fayeeza Kathree-Setiloane had been expected to begin hearing the case against the painting Tuesday.

Instead, citing its national interest and the constitutional issues at stake, she said the case would start Thursday. Kathree-Setiloane and two other High Court judges, among the most senior in South Africa, will hear the case.

Nearly one hundred pro-Zuma protesters were outside the court.

Zuma's children asked to participate on the side of their father. Murray, the artist who painted the portrait, asked to participate alongside the Goodman.

Speaking to the Pretoria News, Murray said he did not intend to cause any 'hurt or to harm the dignity of any person' and described his work as 'an attempt at humorous satire of political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broader context of South African discourse'.

The painting, a black, red and yellow acrylic on canvas priced at 120,000 rand (about $15,000), is in the style of a famous image of founder of Russian communism Lenin is part of a large exhibition of Murray's sculptures and paintings titled 'Hail to the Thief II.'

The ANC has called the show an 'abuse of freedom of artistic expression.'

Polygamist Mr Zuma, 70, has married six times. He currently has four wives having divorced South African cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in 1999. Another wife, Kate Mantsho-Zuma, committed suicide in 2000.

In 2006 he sparked outrage while on trial for rape when he said he had showered after having unprotected sex with an HIV-positive woman, thinking this would reduce his risk of being infected. He told the court he was prepared to marry his accuser and was later found not guilty.
