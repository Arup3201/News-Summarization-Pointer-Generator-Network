Demands by the taxman for the power to raid ISAs were met with a wave of opposition last night.

HM Revenue and Customs wants unprecedented power to settle unpaid tax bills.

It has already been revealed that this includes taking money directly from current accounts – including joint accounts. But the controversial proposals would also make it possible for money to be seized from your tax-free ISA whether it is held in cash or stocks and shares.

The move has been widely criticised by MPs and accountants who fear HMRC, which has a track record of incompetence, will target the wrong people by mistake.

One think-tank, the Adam Smith Institute, said the proposals represent ‘a fundamental assault on the rule of law’ and many of the victims will be ‘completely innocent’.

Anyone who owes £1,000 or more in tax could be affected – and HMRC will not even need to get a judge’s approval to withdraw the cash. The proposals were published in the Budget in March and are subject to a public consultation which ends on July 29.

HMRC expects to seize around £375million over the next four years under the Direct Recovery of Debts powers, due to come into force next year. It predicts around 17,000 people a year will have money taken, the majority self-employed.

Tina Riches, national tax partner at accountancy and investment firm Smith & Williamson, said the proposals ‘provide inadequate assurance for honest taxpayers’ who risked being hit by HMRC errors.

HMRC insists it will not take the money unless the person will be left with at least £5,000 across all their bank accounts and Isas after the tax debt has been paid.

By including Isas, HMRC’s chances of withdrawing money are significantly increased as they are hugely popular.

Around 23million people have a total of £442billion saved in them.

Miss Riches said people must be properly compensated if a mistake is made as a result of the taxman’s new powers.

‘I do not mean that they just get their money back with a bit of interest on top,’ she said. ‘They must be compensated so that their Isas are put back in the position that they would have been in if HMRC had not made a mistake.’

This is because they could miss out on huge rises in share values if the money in their Isa is seized.

Simon Wilks, a tax partner at accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘It is absolutely right that people should pay tax that is due.

‘But in our view, any benefits from these proposals are far outweighed by the potentially extremely serious consequences for individuals and businesses if errors are made.’

Frank Haskew, head of the tax faculty at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said there is considerable concern from both taxpayers and accountants about the proposals.

‘Such powers are unprecedented in the UK and could be open to mistakes and misuse,’ he said.

‘Fundamentally, we believe that money should only be taken from someone’s bank account by agreement or under the supervision of a court.’

A major concern surrounds joint accounts. For example, a woman might pay all the money into it and be unaware that her husband owes money to the taxman.

Last week, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said: 'It will help to level the playing field between those who pay what they owe, when they owe it and those who do not'

Miss Riches said: ‘There are many reasons why an account may be in joint names. For example, an elderly parent may have added a son or daughter to their account.

‘Is it fair that the parent’s bank balance could be reduced because the son or daughter has not paid tax?’

Typically, the people targeted will owe an average of £5,800.

In the consultation document, published last week, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said: ‘It will help to level the playing field between those who pay what they owe, when they owe it and those who do not.’

He said the rules will only target ‘the truly non-compliant’, who he described as ‘a small core of taxpayers who owe significant debts of over £1,000 and have sufficient funds in their accounts to pay’.

A Treasury Committee report warned last week: ‘This policy is highly dependent on HMRC’s ability accurately to determine which taxpayers owe money and what amounts they owe... an ability not always demonstrated in the past.’

HMRC insists it will only seize the money if it has made every effort to contact the taxpayer about the debt.

Its consultation document says it will typically have contacted a taxpayer who has ‘a good history of compliance’ nine times by letter and telephone concerning the debt. The minimum is four times.

Around half of those who will be affected have more than £20,000 in their bank and building society accounts and Isas.

Cheats who fail to pay their taxes and others who find ways of avoiding them cost Britain around £35billion a year, according to HMRC.

An HMRC spokesman said last night: "Where an error by HMRC results in funds being mistakenly transferred out of an ISA we will ensure that funds are replaced and that the account holder does not lose any of their tax free limit for the year."
