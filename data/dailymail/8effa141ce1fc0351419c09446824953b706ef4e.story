His union paymasters want him to move to the Left. And when it came to this group selfie, it seems Ed Miliband took their wishes too much to heart.

In fact, his extreme shift in position meant he almost missed out on appearing in the picture snapped by reality TV star Joey Essex when he found himself surrounded by luvvies and Labour MPs at a party fundraiser.

As they scrambled to get in the frame, the Labour leader was shovelled to the rear left of the group and ended up looking like a photobomber trying to muscle in on the act. Among those more prominent in the huddle were actress Emma Thompson, artist Grayson Perry and writer Kathy Lette.

Bizarre: Joey Essex last night posted this selfie including Ed Miliband, Grayson Perry and Chuka Umunna

Labour frontbenchers Chuka Umunna, Liz
 Kendall and Gloria De Piero also made it, although one high-profile 
colleague missed out – the figure hidden by TOWIE star Essex’s quiff was
 reportedly deputy leader Harriet Harman.

Essex took a second picture of
 himself with Mr Miliband and posted it on Twitter with the group shot, 
labelled ‘My selfie buddies’. In December, he took a selfie with the 
Labour leader at the British Military Awards and refers to the would-be 
prime minister as his ‘bezzie’, slang for best friend.

The
 23-year-old, who tweets about vitally important matters such as having a
 bad hair day, has 2.58million followers on Twitter.

Mr Miliband, who 
tweets about Royal Mail privatisation and the bedroom tax, has 302,000.

The group has all the elements - if not the glamour - of the Oscar's selfie which featured stars including Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey and Julia Roberts.

Essex took the snap at an event to raise money for Mr Miliband's general election war chest.

He wrote on Twitter: 'At #TeamLabour drinks reception tonight with my selfie buddies Emma Thompson and @Ed_Miliband & gang pic.'

He later tweeted a selfie of himself and Mr Miliband, writing: 'With me and my bezzie Ed Miliband.'

Joey Essex described Ed Miliband as his 'bezzie' friend in a later selfie between the two of them

The Labour party is recruiting a senior adviser to bring ‘fresh ideas’ to overhauling the leader’s image.

As Britain's biggest selling broadsheet left-wing newspaper, Ed Miliband understandably wants to keep the Guardian on side.

Today he is visited the paper's north London HQ, to address their morning conference meeting.

But staff will have tried to keep today's edition of its G2 supplement from him, headlined: 'Can you make this guy less weird?'

In
 addition to having ideas about how to improve Mr Miliband’s ‘brand 
strengths’, the successful candidate will also need to have experience 
of dealing with ‘bad news stories’.

But someone obviously thinks that joining the selfie craze is the right way to reverse polls which show four in 10 voters think Mr Miliband is 'weird'.

While Labour has maintained a lead in the polls, Mr Miliband’s personal ratings have remained poor.

A YouGov survey last week showed 41 per cent of people think the Labour leader is ‘weird’ or ‘very weird’.

The
 survey for BuzzFeed, which looked at the public’s perception of the 
leaders’ personalities, also found 36 per cent of the population believe
 Mr Miliband would have been bullied at school.

With
 some opinion polls putting Labour’s lead over the Tories at just one 
point, Mr Miliband has ordered his team to beef up his media operation.

The
 Labour website is advertising the new role of Head of the Leader’s 
Broadcasting, to be based in the Leader of the Opposition’s Office.

The
 new job comes with a £44,244.40 salary, and a ‘fixed sum allowance’ of 
£971. The contract will last only until a month after the general 
election, due in May 2015. 

This week Prince Andrew became the latest prominent public figure to take a spontaneous self-portrait who tweeted a photograph of himself during an event at St James’s Palace.

In the photograph Prince Andrew can be seen grinning into his mobile phone camera from the stage, while members of the delegation – dressed demurely in suits – laugh and take their own pictures of him on their phones.

Best selfie ever: Ellen's A-list Oscar's picture literally broke Twitter when she uploaded this celebrity laden picture during the ceremony

The Prince first tweeted from his 
account, @TheDukeofYork: ‘Welcome to #pitchatpalace I wish you all a 
great event, both entrepreneurs and audience’, signed off by ‘AY’, 
indicating the tweet was written by him, rather than a member of staff.

He
 then tweeted the selfie, which is somewhat at odds with Palace 
protocol, not least because his other tweet included a picture of a 
notice which reads ‘Mobile phones are not permitted in the state rooms’,
 with the word ‘not’ crossed out with black tape.

Prince Andrew was hosting the final of his Pitch @ Palace competition, which looked for students interested in building their own start-up companies.

He joins Prince Charles, the Pope, Ed Miliband, Angela Merkel, David Cameron and Barack Obama who have all taken ‘selfies’ on their mobile phones, in the craze sparked by teenage girls on social media.
