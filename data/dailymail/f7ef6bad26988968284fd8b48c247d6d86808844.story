One of the stars of last year's smash hit movie The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug has been jailed for five months for buying 12 grams of cocaine.

Swedish actor Mikael Persbrandt played shape-shifitng monster Beorn who shelters wizard Gandalf, the dwarfs and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins from the orcs in the film The Hobbit.

Persbrandt, 51, was charged in a complicated drugs case involving ten other people after his number was discovered on a dealer's phone.

His lawyer Per Liljekvist argued that the number being in the phone was no proof that he had been buying the drugs, saying: 'If it turns out an order was made, it was another person who used his phone.'

He maintained that Persbrandt had been at a party on the evening when it was alleged the drugs had been bought, and that he often left his mobile phone lying about.

After the sentencing the actor immediately appealed through his lawyer and it will now be up to the appeals court to decide whether it will allow the appeal to go ahead and then to decide whether or not to uphold the lower court judgement.

The prosecutor Lars Agren said he is convinced that whether the Appeals Court looks at it or not the verdict will remain the same, adding: 'I think there is sound evidence and it was a sound investigation.'
