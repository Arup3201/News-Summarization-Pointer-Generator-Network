The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were left 'terrified' after a plane flying them into Britain narrowly avoided colliding with another aircraft which hadn't cleared a runway in time, it was claimed today.

Passengers on Prince William and Kate Middleton's aircraft back from Copenhagen were said to have been 'very frightened' after the pilot had to ascend quickly to avoid ploughing into another plane.

The royals' flight back from Denmark was about to land at Heathrow when the pilot of the Airbus A320-200 was forced to perform a steep climb at the last minute.

Trip: Hours before the flight drama, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had been pictured in Copenhagen on their first joint humanitarian mission

Passengers on the on 162-seat airliner back to Britain all escaped the episode unhurt, but The Duchess of Cambridge was said to have been 'deeply unsettled' by the incident.

Prince Willam and Kate Middleton were returning from a joint trip to the Danish capital on their first humanitarian mission.

A source close to the incident told The People: 'This really was a serious incident and would have been terrifying for those on board.

'The aircraft ahead of them hadn’t cleared the runway in time for the plane carrying the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to land.

'For anyone who didn’t know what was going on it would have been extremely worrying.'

Staff at British Airways dismissed the emergency ascent at Heathrow as a 'standard procedure'

British Airways admitted one of their pilots was forced to perform the mid-air manoeuvre during the flight on November 2, but dismissed the incident as 'standard procedure'

A spokesperson said: 'Our crew were told by air traffic control to perform a go-around – a perfectly standard operation with no safety implications – because an aircraft from another airline hadn’t fully cleared the runway.

'Safety is always our priority and all our pilots are fully trained to deal with procedures of this kind.

'Our aircraft landed safely and customers left the plane as normal.'

A Clarence House spokesperson would not comment on the incident, while a Heathrow Airport spokesperson did not return a request for comment.
