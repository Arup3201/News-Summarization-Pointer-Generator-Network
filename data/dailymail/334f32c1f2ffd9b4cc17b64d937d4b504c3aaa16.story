The Spanish League agreed on Tuesday to charge Barcelona after their supporters were heard singing ‘Ronaldo is a drunk’ at the Nou Camp on Sunday night. The case will now be passed to the anti-violence committee who must decide whether or not to open an investigation.

In a statement the League said it had listened to audio recordings of the match and were in agreement that in minute 65 of the game around 200 supporters repeatedly chanted ‘He is a drunk, Ronaldo is a drunk’.

The action taken against Barcelona is part of a clampdown on all forms of crowd trouble and chants that are interpreted as being likely to provoke trouble. It comes after a Deportivo supporter was killed in a pitched battle before a match at Atletico Madrid’s Vicente Calderon stadium in November.

This is the 52nd time since the death of the Deportivo fan Francisco Romero on November 30 that the league has asked the anti-violence committee to take action over a chant.

Twelve different clubs first division clubs, and eight second division teams have been targeted but so far of the 52 league complaints, the anti-violence committee have only opened 10 investigations.

So far no action has been taken but after the league reported Real Madrid supporters at Bernabeu for chanting ‘Messi is retarded’ in December, the club were reported to have identified the 17 supporters who started the chant and expelled them.

The Spanish League now have officials at every La Liga match with the job of listening for abusive songs or chants.

Despite the apparently frivolous nature of the song aimed at Ronaldo, Real Madrid fans were keen for action to be taken. Over 80 per cent of voters in one online poll demanded a stand be taken.

The ‘drunk’ references towards Ronaldo were made after various photographs and videos were published of him enjoying 30th birthday party celebrations on the night Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by city neighbours Atletico Madrid.
