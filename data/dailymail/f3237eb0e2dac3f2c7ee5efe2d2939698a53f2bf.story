This is the bizarre moment a homeowner threw an apple at a £250,000 Lamborghini parked up in one of Britain’s most expensive streets.

The middle-aged man, wearing a black vest, is thought to have been annoyed at noise coming from outside his home on Sloane Street, Knightsbridge.

He took out his frustration by picking up the contents of his fruit bowl and launching it at the Lamborghini Aventador in the road below.

Confusion: The driver points up at the window where the apple had come from, seemingly confused over why it had been thrown

The British driver is not thought to have been revving the V12 engine or being antisocial.

'The owner of the Lamborghini was incredibly confused,' said the YouTuber who filmed the encounter, Shmee150.

'The apple hit the window and fortunately it didn’t smash so there was no damage. It is certainly one of the more bizarre incidents of the summer.'

Mystery: The British driver is not thought to have been revving the V12 engine or being antisocial

London is home to many of the world’s finest supercars, but there are currently more than normal in capital with the Middle-Eastern playboys enjoying their holidays,having flown the vehicles over from Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

Some locals have blamed the foreign tourists for making their lives a misery through the summer months by revving their cars unnecessarily and using the area around Harrods as their personal racetrack.

But others say it is British drivers who are causing the trouble, driving into London in an attempt to impress the wealthy supercar owners.
