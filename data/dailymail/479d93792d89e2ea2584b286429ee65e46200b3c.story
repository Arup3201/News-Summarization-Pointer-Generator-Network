John Quinn believes the best is yet to come from The Wow Signal as his classy colt prepares for his latest big test in Paris next month.

The unbeaten son of Starspangledbanner, winner of the Prix Morny at Deauville last time out, came through his latest canter in top shape as he builds up for a first run at seven furlongs in the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere at Longchamp.

‘He’s in rude health at the moment, I couldn’t be happier with him,’ said Quinn (below). ‘We are just keeping him ticking over and I think you saw in his last race that another furlong is what he wants now.’

Meanwhile, John Gosden is likely to give Taghrooda a racecourse gallop as she is readied for a tilt at the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe.

The Epsom Oaks and King George heroine lost her unbeaten record to Tapestry in the Yorkshire Oaks.

But Gosden said: ‘She came screaming into season the day after York. She has put on weight and I need to get it off now.’
