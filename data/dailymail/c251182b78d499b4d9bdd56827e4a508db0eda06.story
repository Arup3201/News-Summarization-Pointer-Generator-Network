Chantelle Newbery was Australia's first female 10-metre diving champion when she won gold at Athens in 2004

An Olympic diver who made history for ending an 80-year gold medal drought for Australians in the sport, has escaped conviction during a Queensland court appearance for drug possession.

Chantelle Newbery, 37, was placed on a drug diversion program after pleading guilty to drug charges when she was arrested at a Lota property, east of Brisbane, for failing to dispose of syringes and possession of methylamphetamine on March 28 this year.

The 37-year-old champion diver, who won a gold medal at Athens in 2004, pleaded guilty in the Cleveland Magistrates Court on Thursday to both charges. She won Australia's first gold medal in diving in 80 years, and was the first Australian woman ever to win gold at the elite level.

But Newbery, who Diving Australia CEO David Bell said struggled with personal battles, soon lost touch with the sport about a year ago when she split from the organisation where she was the national talent ID coordinator.

'We're certainly aware of some of her issues and have even recently been offering support to her.'

He said the organisation had been attempting to counsel the 37-year-old, but has not been able to get in contact to offer its support.

'At this stage we haven't been in contact for a little while ... we haven't had any reply from her. We'll always continue to offer support to Chantelle should she request it, he said.Â

Newbery publicly revealed her battle with chronic depression and suicide attempts in 2009, during an interview with Woman's Day.

Magistrate Athol Kennedy placed Newbery onto the drug diversion program, meaning no conviction was recorded and he warned her that she faced a serious risk of jail time if she was charged with any more drug offences.
