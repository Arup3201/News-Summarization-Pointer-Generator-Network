Crash: Mr Zoricic was a hugely talented skier

Mr Zoricic has raced on the World Cup circuit for more than three years and was competing in his 36th event.

He was eighth in the 2011 World Championships at Deer Valley, Utah.

He is the second Canadian skier to die this season.

In January, 29-year-old freestyle skier Sarah Burke died following a training accident on a halfpipe in Utah.

Mr Zoricic was a member of the Craigleith Ski Club in Ontario.

'I can't believe this tragic news. 
Nick Zoricic has died? I'm sick to my stomach,' former Canadian Alpine 
racer Brian Stemmle wrote on Twitter.

U.S.
 racer Ted Ligety also posted a message of condolence for Zoricic on 
Twitter soon after winning a World Cup giant slalom race in Kranjska 
Gora, Slovenia.

'Skiing is a great sport that gives but it also takes, sad day to lose Nick Zoricic, you'll be missed bud,' Mr Ligety wrote.

Grindelwald has been a venue on the skicross World Cup circuit since 2005.

The Swiss village beneath the Eiger and Jungfrau mountain peaks was hosting a meet for the fifth straight year.
