Scotland could end up ‘like Panama’ if it gains independence but keeps the pound, George Osborne has warned.

The Chancellor said it was ‘unlikely’ the rest of the UK would want to enter a currency union with a separate Scotland.

A devastating 118-page Treasury paper sets out the economic realities of independence.

Damning: George Osborne, pictured in Glasgow yesterday, said he could veto any plan to share the pound with an independent Scotland as the deal could be risky, which would be a huge blow to Alex Salmond should he win the 2014 referendum

Scottish banknotes would disappear if voters back independence and opts to continue using the UK pound, the Treasury warned

The country could use sterling with 
Westminster’s permission, Mr Osborne said, but would not have any say 
over the Bank of England or macro-economic policy, which influences 
currency.

‘We can say no to a currency zone, a 
euro-style arrangement between two foreign governments,’ he told BBC 
Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘Scotland could go on using the pound 
rather like Panama uses the American dollar, but it would have 
absolutely no control at all over its currency or its macro-economic 
framework.’

Countries do use foreign currencies without consent, he said, ‘but it’s a very, very difficult option’.

Mr Osborne launched the Scotland Analysis paper on Currency and Monetary Policy, in the Glasgow Trades Hall

Mr Osborne and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, ruled out a euro-style currency zone in which Scotland could opt-in to using the pound 

The reference to Panama raises the 
spectre of a scandal in the 1690s, when Scotland tried to colonise part 
of the country, resulting in thousands of deaths. Seven years later, a 
bankrupt Scotland agreed to the Act of Union.

Mr Osborne also warned that England, 
Wales and Northern  Ireland would not tie themselves ‘to the economic 
policies of what would have become a foreign government’ or to an 
economy ‘very dependent’ on oil and finance.

Mr Osborne said in Glasgow: ‘Why would
58million citizens give away some of their sovereignty over monetary 
and potentially other economic policy to five million people in another 
state?

‘Let’s be clear – abandoning  current arrangements would  represent a very deep dive indeed in to uncharted waters.’

Backing: Former Chancellor, Labour's Alistair Darling, says that Osborne is right and that the SNP cannot promise to keep the pound

Should Scotland become independent in 
the 2014 referendum, and want to use the pound, it would have to submit 
economic plans to the UK before its administration in Holyrood, he said.

He went on: ‘The conclusion is clear –
the pound we share works well. The saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, why
fix it?”, but I say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t break it”.’

Scottish First Minister Alex  Salmond 
accused Westminster of ‘sabre-rattling’. He said: ‘This is a Tory 
Chancellor trying to scare people in Scotland, trying to stop them 
voting for independence.

‘But the day after a resounding “yes” 
vote in the referendum . . . he will sing an entirely different tune. 
It’s in everyone’s interests to have a currency area after 
independence.’

The Treasury gave four options facing 
an independent Scotland: forming a UK currency union; joining Sterling 
with no control over policy; joining the euro; or a separate Scottish 
currency.

Mr Osborne also warned that Scotland could have to take on large amounts of national debt.

But Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney claimed ‘the UK as the successor state is obliged to hold on to all of the debt’.

Charles Kennedy, former Lib Dem leader
and spokesman for the pro-Union Better Together campaign, said the SNP 
had showed it was ‘ill-prepared and ill-informed . . . about the 
ramifications of independence.’
