It is one of the world's most virginal, untouched landscapes.

Yet while surveying the bleak whiteness of eastern Antarctica, researchers on an expedition to hunt for small fragments of meteorites were stunned to spot a dark blot on the landscape.

On further inspection, they realised they had found a giant 18kg (40-pound) meteorite poking out from the ice sheet - the largest found in the area in 25 years.

Total known meteorites discovered around the world: 56,555

Total meteorites found in Antarctica only: 38,537

Among
Antarctic meteorites, only 30 have a mass greater than 18kg.

The 18kg 
meteorite has the fifth largest mass ever discovered in East Antarctica 
(Dronning Maud Land), and is the first of this size found in the area 
since 1988.

Per year, around 1,000 meteorites weighing less than 100g are found, and about 100 less than 1kg.

They described their find as 'special', and hope it could help explain how the solar system formed.

'To find something this large was very exciting for us - you can see it from very far away,' said Vinciane Debaille, a 
geologist from Université Libre de Bruxelles, who led the Belgian team 
during the expedition.

'That’s why we look for meteorites in Antarctica, because you can easily find the black spots on the white snow - but when it’s huge like that you can see it from 50m away or more.'

The meteorite is unusual as the fusion crust – the meteorite’s outer 
casing - was eroded, allowing the scientists to inspect the rock 
underneath.

The Brussels-based International Polar Foundation said Thursday the meteorite is an 'ordinary chondrite,' the most common meteorite.

'This meteorite was a very unexpected
find for us, not only due to its weight, but because we don’t normally 
find such large meteorites in Antarctica',

'This is the biggest meteorite found 
in East Antarctica for 25 years, so it’s a very special discovery for 
us, only made possible by the existence and location of Princess 
Elisabeth Antarctica.'

The rock was was discovered Jan. 28, and is undergoing a special thawing process in Japan so water won't penetrate it before it is studied.

The eight members of the SAMBA 
project, from Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and Vrije Universiteit
Brussel (VUB), Japan’s National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) and 
Tokyo University  were searching for meteorites scattered across the 
Nansen Ice Field on January 28, when they found the 18kg ordinary 
chondrite.

The team discovered a total of 425 
meteorites, with a total weight of 75kg during the 40 day expedition, at
an altitude of 2,900m, 140km south of Belgium’s Princess Elisabeth 
Antarctica research base.

While this is the largest found in eastern Antarctica since 1988, a 21.5-kilo (47.5-pound) meteorite was found on the continent in 2005, according to the Meteoritical Bulletin Database.

The largest in Antarctica was 407 kilograms (897 pounds), found in 1976 or 1977.

Initial field analysis by the 
scientists suggests that the 18kg meteorite is an ordinary chondrite, 
the most abundant kind of  meteorite.

The fusion crust – the meteorite’s outer casing - was eroded, allowing the scientists to inspect the rock underneath.

'We study meteorites in order to 
better understand how the solar system formed, how it evolved, how the 
Earth became such a unique planet in our solar system', said Debaille.

'This season’s SAMBA mission was a success both in terms of the number and weight of the meteorites we found.

'Two years ago, we found less than 10kg.

'This year, we found so much that we had to call the travel agency – because we had 75kg of meteorites to take home'.
