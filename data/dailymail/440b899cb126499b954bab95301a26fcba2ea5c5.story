A federal judge has been shot outside his house in an apparent attempted robbery, police said.

Judge Terrence G. Berg was approached by two men while taking the trash out from his Detroit, Michigan home around 9pm on Thursday.

A struggle ensued and the 55-year-old was  shot in the leg. The suspects, thought to be aged between 18 and 20, escaped in a  dark-coloured Dodge Charger.

Berg's condition is not known but police said the injury was not life-threatening.

Steve Dolunt, Assistant Police Chief, said it was not clear whether it was an attempted robbery or failed burglary.

'It happened in front of his house,' he told The Detroit News. 

Monica Moore, who lives opposite Berg, said she heard screaming and yelling.

'I looked out and I saw there were a fair amount of people there. I could hear the police cars coming and then there was a lot of commotion,' she told the Detroit Free Press. 

Chief U.S. District Judge Gerald Rosen said: 'While we are relieved to hear that all indications are that Judge Berg will be fine and make a quick recovery, the thoughts and prayers of our entire court family are with him and his family.' 

And Brenda Lawrence, congresswoman from Michigan's 14th District, added on Twitter: 'I am praying for the health of Federal Judge Terrence Berg of Detroit, with best wishes for a speedy recovery.'

The father-of-three was also previously chief of a crime unit in the Michigan Attorney General's Office.

If caught the pair would receive a higher charge if they are found to have targeted Berg because of his job.

The FBI are investigating.
