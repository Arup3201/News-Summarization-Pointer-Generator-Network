Gareth Bale’s stunning free-kick nine minutes from time spared Wales from the ignominy of drawing with minnow principality Andorra and sparked a pitch invasion from travelling fans.

The Real Madrid star struck a brilliant shot that curled into the net and then sent over-exuberant supporters back to their seats after they had crashed over an advertising hoarding to celebrate.

He had earlier scored a soaring header to equalise an opening penalty from Andorra, their first competitive goal in more than four years.

But Bale blasted the artificial pitch at the Estadi Nacional as the ‘worst’ he had played on in his career. The 3G surface would cause awkward rolls and spray black rubber pellets when the ball bounced.

‘I can't describe how bad, bobbly and hard the pitch was to deal with,’ he said.

His brace bailed out Chris Coleman who would have faced serious recriminations with defeat here in Wales’s opening Euro 2016 qualifier. This entire nation’s population could fit inside the 85,000-capacity Bernabeu for Real Madrid’s derby against Atletico on Saturday, which is where Bale now heads.

Carlo Ancelotti will be relieved the heavy challenges from Andorra’s team did not do harm to his player, but Aaron Ramsey paid a price, limping off with an ankle injury that makes him a doubt for Arsenal’s match with Manchester City on Saturday.

‘He got kick and twist,’ said Coleman. ‘Hopefully he'll be OK for Arsenal at the weekend but we'll have to see what the next 24-48 hours holds.’

Coleman described the pitch as ‘not up to standard of a UEFA qualifier’ and added: ‘I think we showed hell of a lot of courage.’

He paid tribute to Bale. ‘There are only two players in the world, Lionel Messi and Gareth Bale, who could have done something like that tonight,’ said Coleman. ‘Gareth was absolutely magnificent.’

Before the match Zidedine Zidane, manager of Real Madrid’s B side, had spoken about the ‘tragedy’ it would be were his club colleague Bale not perform for at a major international tournament. ‘He is one of the top five players in the world - for him not to be there is just wrong,’ said the French World Cup winner.

So it was with a dollop of irony that in the build-up to Andorra’s goal in the sixth minute Bale was dumfounded by a Zidane turn by a part-timer. Gabi Riera dragged the ball skillfully to swerve round his more illustrious opponent and eventually Andorra won a throw-in.

From there Marc Vales flicked it on and Ivan Lorenzo fell under pressure from Neil Taylor. At first Slovenian referee Slavko Vincic waved away the hosts’ appeals but seconds later had pointed to the spot after a signal from fifth official Mitja Zganec behind the goal.

It looked a soft penalty but Taylor had grabbed Lorenzo’s shirt.

Captain Lima, a 34-year-old defender, stepped up in front of the vocal travelling support and calmly sent Wayne Hennessey the wrong way. Andorra had taken the lead and it was incomprehensible. The numbers told you that.

For a nation ranked 199 in the world – who have lost their last 44 competitive games, and only won one in their history – this was their first competitive goal in four years.

It was not so much a roar that went up in this tiny stadium holding 3,300, mostly Welsh, people. But the echoes could be heard as they travelled up the surrounding mountains. A picturesque setting, a nightmarish scenario for Coleman.

Bale responded as he has done countless times.

First he headed narrowly over from Allen’s corner and then in the 22nd minute found an equaliser that brought much relief.

Davies produced a superb deep ball from the left and Bale rose as high as his athletic frame allows and glanced a brilliant header into the far corner. His primal celebration showed how much his country means to him.

That continued after the interval. In the 57th minute Bale struck a trademark dipping free-kick that goalkeeper Ferran Pol punched clear and whipped a perfect cross with his weaker foot that Andy King failed to reach fully.

It was not all one way, though. Slack play from Ramsey allowed Cristian Martinez a run and shot at goal that flew wide.

As the minutes ticked down it looked like a seismic shock was stirring. But Bale came up with the goods. Again.
