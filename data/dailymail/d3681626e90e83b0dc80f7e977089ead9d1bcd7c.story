Lorna Smalley, 37, lost her memory after developing encephalitis - inflammation of the brain. She is pictured with her daughter, Jasmine, and her husband, Mark

A mother who lost her memory after being struck down by a life-threatening illness is able to care for her daughter again thanks to dozens of daily iPhone reminders.

Lorna Smalley, 37, lost almost two years of her memory after being diagnosed with encephalitis - inflammation of the brain.

Her memory loss was so severe that while she was in hospital for a month, she did not ask after her two-year-old daughter and even asked whether she was Chinese.

But her miraculous recovery means she can now care for Jasmine again and has returned to work - with the help of iPhone reminders that make up for her occasionally unreliable short-term memory.

Up to 10 reminders a day tell her to pack her daughter’s nursery bag, when she needs to go to work and when to do everything from the washing up to the laundry.

They also remind her of every family birthday and even her own wedding anniversary.

Mrs Smalley, from Nottingham, said: ‘Although I remembered my daughter once she came to visit me in hospital, before that I hadn’t questioned why she wasn’t there and that’s scary. 

‘Now I’m over the moon that I’m back to being a mum and back to work - even if I need a few reminders here and there!’

Mrs Smalley’s terrifying descent to losing her memory started when she woke up feeling unwell one morning in January 2013 and was sent home from work sick.

The next 
day her husband Mark, 40, came home to check on her at lunch time but 
within hours she was struggling to focus and was taken into hospital.

Her
 husband went home from the hospital to care for their daughter Jasmine,
 now three, but just a few hours later he was called back to say goodbye
 as his wife’s condition had rapidly deteriorated.

When he 
arrived, a nurse called the two most recently dialled numbers on his 
phone to summon his friends for support as doctors were sure Mrs Smalley
 would not make it through the night.

Amazingly, she survived the night despite being in and out of intensive care and spending more than a week in two drug induced comas.

Her husband was warned she could face severe permanent brain damage.

Mrs
 Smalley’s doctor believes she had an autoimmune encephalitis when her 
body started producing anti-bodies which attacked her brain.

Encephalitis can have many different causes including an infection and abnormal immune system reactions.

Mrs Smalley was so ill that doctors warned her husband she might not survive

Miraculously, Mrs Smalley recovered but she was left with memory problems. She has now had to use family photographs to remind her of all the events she has forgotten

Medical 
staff tried to help her body fight the disease with a plasma exchange 
which had dramatic results and after two sessions she was able to sit up
 and eat a sandwich.

A
 plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis, is a 
procedure where a machine is used to separate plasma from the other 
components of a patient’s blood.

During
 the procedure, the plasma is removed and replaced with a substitute and
 the red cells, white cells and platelets are returned to the patient.

Encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition that causes inflammation of the brain.

It usually begins with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature and a headache.

More serious symptoms can then develop.

These include confusion, disorientation, seizures and changes in personality.

There are several different types of encephalitis that have different causes.

The most common are caused by infections or an autoimmune reaction.

The illness requires urgent treatment - usually in an intensive care unit and about 10 per cent of cases are fatal.

Some people make a full recovery but many experience permanent brain damage.

This can cause complications such as memory loss, epilepsy, personality changes and fatigue.

But when Mrs Smalley woke up there were significant gaps in her memory.

She
 had no idea why she was in hospital and for a week she had to be 
constantly reminded that she’d had a miscarriage a month before.

It
 was only when her husband brought Jasmine to visit her just before she 
returned home that Mrs Smalley realised she had not once asked after the
 daughter she had given birth to and looked after for the previous two 
years.

She finally left hospital a month after being admitted and has been trying to remember the missing bits of the puzzle ever since.

As well as her daily reminders, she wrote a diary when she left hospital to document everything she re-learned and to try and make sure she didn’t forget anything again.

She had to look through photos of family holidays to try and fill in the gaps in her memory and has shocked herself by forgetting the way round Nottingham where she has lived for 18 years.

Sadly, she has had to grieve twice for a friend who she had forgotten had died.

When Mrs Smalley found a letter from her friend’s mother thanking her for a donation to a memorial fund, she found herself mourning for the second time.

But psychometric tests have proved she’d retained all the necessary information to work as a practice pharmacist and is making a gradual return to her job.

Mrs Smalley said: ‘It’s bizarre that I’ve remembered some things so well but I can’t for the life of me remember some holidays and certain events.

‘I’ve forgotten almost anyone new I’d met in the last two years as well basic things like where everything was in our house.

'I’ve spent months looking for a box of light bulbs that I put in a safe place and now can’t remember where I put them.

Mrs Smalley now keeps a diary to ensure that she doesn't forget anything else

‘I don’t remember anything about the 
time I was sick. No matter how many times people tell me about it, it 
still doesn’t sink in. I don’t know how it could happen so quickly.

‘I really thought of myself as very clued up on even the most obscure medical conditions but I’d never even heard of encephalitis.

‘I don’t think I’ll ever forget the word now!’

Mr Smalley, an accountant, said: ‘Lorna had always been a list maker but now it’s that with bells on!

‘We’re just trying to get back to life that’s as normal as possible with the almost constant alarms.

‘It was awful when she first went into hospital and she was hooked up to machines with tubes to help her breathe and eat.

‘She looked like she was barely alive - I didn’t know how that could be.

‘Because you don’t have a big list of all the things you know, once she came back from hospital she just gradually realised what she had forgotten and we had to piece her memory back together.

‘Lorna was in bits when she re-realised that her friend had died. But we had already grieved once.

‘When she came out of hospital it wasn’t the Lorna that went in, and it was really difficult because she didn’t remember much of what we had shared together, but thankfully that’s gradually come back and we’re a couple like we were.’

Dr Ava Easton, Chief Executive of the Encephalitis Society said: ‘There are around 6,000 new cases of encephalitis diagnosed in England each year alone and although there are many different outcomes, depending on how the individual was affected, memory loss can be severe.’
