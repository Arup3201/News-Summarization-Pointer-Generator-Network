Weighing around 500 pounds and with sharp claws and teeth, Alaskan black bears are bigger and scarier than most.

But when this large black bear strolled into the bar of an Alaskan hotel on Monday night, it hadn't counted upon coming face to face with.... an angry barmaid.

As the vast creature strolled into the Alaskan Hotel and Bar in Juneau, bar worker Ariel Svetlik-McCarthy screamed at it: 'No, bear, get out.  No, you can't be in here'.

Here it comes: The bar's CCTV shows the bear strolling past the windows as it heads for the historic Alaskan Bar

And, astonishingly, the bear simply turned around and walked back out.

The hotel and bar manager C. Scott Fry said he watched the omnivorous animal walk down the sidewalk and past the historic hotel's lobby.

He said: 'And as soon as he got to the bar door, it made a left and walked in like he wanted to have a beer. 

'

But Ms Svetlik-McCarthy was having none of it, and screeched very effectively at the bear.

The hotel has now put video footage of the incident on its Facebook page under the caption: 'Ariel yelled at him and he listened! Yes, we have tough bartenders!

After the incident in the Alaskan state capital, a bear expert said it was lucky the animal did as it was told.

Area management biologist Ryan Scott with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game told ktoo.org that he'd heard of bears visiting Bartlett Regional Hospital and private homes.

Luckily for the beer drinkers in the Alaskan capital of Juneau, the bear picked a Monday night so the bar was empty

When it hears Ariel Svetlik-McCarthy screeching at it to do as it's told, the obedient bear turns tail and walks away

But he said bears going inside buildings is rare.

'Sounds to me like they did great, and it’s good news the bear did oblige,' Scott said.

Luckily for Ms Svetlik-McCarthy, black bears in Alaska tend to feel sluggish rather than ravenous at this time of year.

According to Bear.org, September means ripe acorns which means bears fill up on them and are consequently less hungry and less of a threat to humans.  Towards the end of the month they start to go in to hibernation, and don't wake up until spring.
