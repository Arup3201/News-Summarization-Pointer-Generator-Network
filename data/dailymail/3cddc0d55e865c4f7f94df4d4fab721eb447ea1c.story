Sorry: The family of Russell Joslin, a BBC journalist who killed himself after allegedly being harassed by a female colleague, has received an apology from the Corporation

The BBC has ‘apologised  unreservedly’ to the family of a radio presenter who committed suicide after claiming his bosses ignored complaints that he was being sexually harassed.

Russell Joslin, 50, died in October after reporting to managers that a senior woman colleague had bullied him for five years.

Mr Joslin, the son of a chief constable, believed he was sidelined after rejecting her advances and his family demanded an inquiry after his death.

Yesterday, the corporation apologised to Mr Joslin’s family after a report found the way the BBC had dealt with the complaints was ‘not good enough’.

It also reported criticism of the female colleague, who cannot be named for legal reasons, with others describing her as a ‘strong and dominating personality’, who ‘created an atmosphere of intimidation’.

Referred to as ‘colleague A’, the woman is said to have been ‘very difficult to work with,’ with ‘managers scared to confront her’.

 Mr Joslin, who was a reporter at BBC Coventry and Warwickshire, died at a psychiatric hospital in Warwick, three days after he tried to kill himself by walking in front of a bus.

He had been tormented by work-related stress and had only recently returned part-time to the station.

He is believed to have received a series of phone messages from his female colleague branding him a ‘flake’ and a ‘loser’ after they argued during a meal out in 2007.

He had allegedly walked out on her in a restaurant, leaving her to find her own way back to Coventry, where she was working at the time.

Upset: Russell Joslin's father Peter, 78, pictured at his home in Kenilworth, has blamed Corporation bosses for failing to stop his son's death

According to reports, one of the 
phone messages sent to Mr Joslin said: ‘Thanks for abandoning me. Don’t 
ever, ever think of me as your mate again.

'Do what you have to at the BBC cause you are a loser on 27 grand a year. But don’t ever encroach on me or my talent.’

After bosses failed to act on his 
complaints he was left ‘a shadow of his former self’, Mr Joslin’s family
 said. Yesterday, they added that the BBC had ‘clearly let Russell 
down’.

‘They could and should have done 
more. All of their staff regardless of role should be treated equally 
and have the same standards expected of them.

'Whilst we do not blame any individual
 and nor should anyone involved in Russell’s care do so, tragically it 
is possible that Russell might still be alive if the BBC system had 
pro-actively handled his complaints with more competence, openness, and 
humanity.’

Mr Joslin’s father Peter, a former 
Warwickshire chief constable, previously said that after his son 
rejected the advances of his colleague ‘life became very tough for him’.

Yesterday a BBC spokesman said: ‘The 
BBC extends our deepest sympathies to Russell’s family, friends and 
colleagues. Russell was a respected and much loved member of the team at
 Radio Coventry and Warwickshire and he is greatly missed.

'We would also like to thank the Joslin family for their participation in this investigation.

‘The BBC acknowledges that aspects of 
the handling of Russell Joslin’s case were not good enough. We have 
apologised unreservedly to the Joslin family.’
