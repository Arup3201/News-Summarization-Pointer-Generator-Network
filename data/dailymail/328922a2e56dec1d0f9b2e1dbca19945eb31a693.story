The Android Wear-powered watch is now available in the US for $249.99, and is set to launch in the UK at the beginning of October costing £199.

Motorola also unveiled the new Moto X 5.2-inch phone, its next-generation budget Moto G, and the Moto Hint bluetooth earpiece.

The Moto 360 has a round face and syncs with any Android smartphone running 4.3 or higher.

It shows notifications from apps including Facebook, Twitter and email applications, and can be controlled by touch, or by voice.

Elsewhere, sensors track the wearer’s steps and heart rate.

Motorola claims the device has an all-day battery life, but it is said to be closer to 12 hours, and it is charged wirelessly.

Moto 360 is available in black leather and a limited edition grey leather with suede finish. Later this year, two metal options will go on sale for $299.99 in the US.
