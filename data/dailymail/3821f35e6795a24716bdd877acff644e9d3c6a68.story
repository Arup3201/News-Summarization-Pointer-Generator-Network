Honesty got the better of Mauricio Pochettino. First, he admitted that he had next to nothing to do with the signing of Eric Dier, Tottenham’s unlikely hero on the opening day of the season.

‘The deal was already on the table,’ said Pochettino, although he clearly did not try to veto the £4million transfer from Sporting Lisbon set up by chairman Daniel Levy and technical director Franco Baldini.

So, how about the serendipity which saw Kyle Naughton sent off in the first half and Dier moved from centre half to right back at West Ham on Saturday, enabling him to later burst forward and win the game in stoppage time?

There was only one game in the top flight in 2013-14 to see both sides reduced to 10 men (Norwich v Newcastle in January).

‘No, no, I was not surprised to see him score,’ said Pochettino, with a shake of his head, before his face cracked into a grin and he indicated with a finger that his nose was growing like Pinocchio’s. With his improving English, and his gift for mime, perhaps we will begin to understand more of Pochettino’s character this season.

The Argentine can laugh after a win, but he is driven. When Dier ghosted behind West Ham’s defence to collect a pass from Harry Kane and slide the ball into the net, he pummelled the air with both fists.

This win mattered. A winning start as Levy’s ninth Tottenham manager (or head coach, as they prefer) and proof that he might be the one to inject steel into a club too often seen as lacking resolve.

On this point, he was happy to take some credit. ‘The team showed we are ambitious and we believe every time that we can win,’ said Pochettino. ‘It is important to build this mentality and spirit. This will give us confidence and trust in our style and more belief.’

At Southampton, his high-pressing tactics produced intense, attractive football, but also clean sheets. Saints conceded just once in their first seven Barclays Premier League games last season.

Spurs rode their luck at Upton Park, but keeper Hugo Lloris was magnificent and the new boss was rewarded for bold strategic decisions: not to remove a striker when Naughton was dismissed and to start with 20-year-old Dier ahead of captain Michael Dawson.

‘We made our decisions based on information from training and pre-season. It was a good decision from the manager,’ said Pochettino. Again with a smile.

The versatile Dier, eased from central defence to full back after Naughton’s red card, defended solidly and offered greater adventure once West Ham’s James Collins was sent off and the teams were reduced to 10 a side for the last 27 minutes.

An England Under 21 international, Dier is the grandson of former FA secretary Ted Croker. Born in Cheltenham, he was raised in Portugal from the age of 10, when his mother’s job took the family overseas. While Pochettino was having problems controlling the length of his nose, Sam Allardyce’s woes were also growing. The heat is already on the Hammers boss after losing a derby which might have turned out differently had Mark Noble scored a first-half penalty.

‘The start is a trigger to the whole season,’ said Allardyce.

‘The perfect example is our first two seasons back in the Premier League. We took 14 points in the first eight games in the first, and only eight in the first eight last season — which was a struggle.’
