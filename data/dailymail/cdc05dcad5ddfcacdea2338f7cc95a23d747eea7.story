George Ford has declared himself ready to wear England’s pivotal fly-half shirt against Samoa while warning his team-mates to expect a ‘nasty’ review following their latest defeat.

The 21-year-old Bath fly-half was a second-half replacement for cramp victim Owen Farrell on Saturday, and looks certain to make his first start against Samoa as England look to salvage some pride from what has been a woeful QBE series so far.

‘I think I’m ready, yeah,’ said the twice-capped playmaker. ‘I really want a chance. The players I’ve got around me are very good too.

‘People like Owen and Brad Barritt and Kyle and the No 9s, with Danny (Care) and Ben (Youngs), it’s brilliant to play with.

‘We just need to come together as a team and be cohesive and get that understanding together, because in international rugby, more than anything, you need to understand each other’s games. You can’t go off on your own, on a tangent.’

Gloucester No 8 Ben Morgan is also expected to start against the Samoans in place of Billy Vunipola, while Wasps blindside James Haskell could replace Tom Wood.

With ball in hand Tom Wood impressed, but he gave away too many penalties and lacked at the breakdown

The players and coaching staff will review Saturday’s game at their Pennyhill Park training base on Monday and Ford expects some home truths to be told following their latest loss.

‘I think it will be constructive,’ he said. ‘There’s things that happened against South Africa that probably happened last week (against the All Blacks) a bit.

‘For it to happen two weeks on the bounce it could get a little bit nasty. But we’re an honest team, (we) stick our hands up and say we’re going to get better.’

Danny Care marked his 50th Test with a performance he'd prefer to forget

With England’s half backs Farrell and Care struggling with their kicking game and failing to ignite the backs against the All Blacks and South Africa, Ford could partner Leicester’s Youngs against Samoa.

‘We’re constantly trying to improve,’ he added. ‘We’ve had a couple of bad results. But the only important thing is to come in on Monday, learn and get better and try to put it out there next weekend.’
