Posing provocatively on a sofa while wearing a tight glittering dress, it's easy to see how this curvaceous blonde caught Prince Harry's attention during his now-infamous night in Las Vegas.

Carrie Reichert claims she kissed the young Royal in a naked 'drunken fumble' and that she was alone with Prince Harry in his hotel room for up to 20 minutes during a party in Nevada's Sin City last month.

Since the scandal broke Prince Harry has been inundated by media attention, but newly-released photos of Carrie reveal that the 32-year-old is not averse to playing up for an audience.

Tell-all: Blonde Carrie Reichert claimed  she was alone with Prince Harry in his hotel room for up to 20 minutes during a party in Nevada's Sin City last month

Strike a pose: The Royal was completely naked during their tryst, she claims, while she stripped down to a string bikini

The series show Carrie in a variety of poses including a snap of her in a cut-out black 
swimming costume wearing sunglasses, which looks as if the beautician has 
taken the photo herself in a mirror.

In another photo seemingly taken on the same night as one of her posing on a sofa, Carrie is shown leaning against a balcony window with one leg against the glass while holding a large wineglass in her hand.

She is the first woman to speak out about Harry's wild night in
 Vegas, where he was pictured frolicking naked with a young woman during
 a game of 'strip billiards'.

Asked about the latest account to come out about the prince’s antics in Las Vegas, a St James’s Palace spokesman flatly denied the girl’s claims.

‘The story is untrue,’ they said.

And a source close to the prince also questioned the woman’s account, saying: ‘This lady was not present with Prince Harry on the night in question or on any occasion.’

While she stripped down to a string bikini, she claims that Harry was completely naked during their tryst.

However, despite the intimate nature 
of their rendezvous, Carrie insisted their kiss was 'fun' and 'not 
romantic'.

She also claimed that, in spite of many people stripping off 
at the party, it was not an orgy.

Instead, she said, Harry was a 'gentleman' but added he was completely 'wasted'.

Carrie looks more demure in a photo from her LinkedIn webpage in which she details her career and education

The spa-owner,
 who had been visiting from San Diego with a group of girlfriends, 
claims she was hand-picked to join the Prince's party after his friends 
spotted her near the swimming pool at the Encore At Wynn hotel, it was 
reported.

The British-born 
beauty said she was approached by one of the Prince's entourage who 
invited her to party with them in his penthouse.

She told The People: 'I'm not going to pass an opportunity to party with Prince Harry.'

When she got upstairs, she said, the party was in 'full swing' with guests - and Harry - already naked.

Wild times: Harry's partying in Vegas got him into serious trouble, forcing him into hiding when he got back afterwards.

She added: 'Harry was already 
undressed. It was just crazy, he looked actually delirious. There was a 
pool table and he was playing air guitar with pool sticks.'

Carrie said Harry took her by the hand and led her from the living room to his bedroom soon after introducing herself to him.

Harry was already naked and she removed her dress to reveal a string bikini before she kissed him, she said.

The pair then had a conversation about her childhood links with Britain before enjoying a 'drunken fumble'.

She
 added: 'We kissed for 15 to 20 minutes. I am sure someone stumbled in 
as there were people going in and out of rooms all the time. We kissed 
again and he said "That was great".'

Controversial: Harry's now infamous trip to Vegas has been put in a little more context following today's news he is back in Afghanistan

The Prince had been spotted clearly enjoying himself with friends and young women at a pool party in Vegas

Carrie said they then both rejoined the party in the living room and carried on drinking until she went back to her hotel room.

Harry was photographed on a mobile 
phone in just a necklace with a naked female playmate hiding behind him 
having played a game of strip pool in his VIP Las Vegas suite.

Another 
showed him giving the same topless woman a naked bear hug, which have 
since been seen by tens of millions across the world.

As well as the embarrassment, it did raise security fears about how well the prince was protected on his Vegas trip.

Despite Met sources saying that there
 was no security breach and that officers were not there to protect his 
reputation, it is believed two of  Harry’s most high-ranking personal 
protection officers have already been interviewed by their bosses back 
in London.

They were accused of watching him 
being photographed playing ‘strip billiards’ in his Las Vegas hotel 
suite but failed to take any action.
