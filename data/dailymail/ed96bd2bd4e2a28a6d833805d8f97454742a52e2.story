Democrats don't know enough about most of their party's possible presidential candidates to be able to say whether they should run for higher office or not, a new poll shows.

Of the seven Democratic politicians tested by CBS News, just two, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden were well enough known for members of their own political party to come to a decision about their candidacy.

Republican politicians fared slightly better. Six of the 13 potential candidates tested by CBS were recognizable enough for self-identified Republicans to offer an opinion on their potential campaigns.

Who?: Most Democrats don't know about either of these men to be able to determine whether or not they should run for president in 2016. On the left is outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. On the right is former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb. Webb is the only Democrat to have formally announced his candidacy for higher office

On the Republican side, a majority of Republicans said they were familiar with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Pain, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney.

They were mostly unfamiliar with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, outgoing Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.

They also said they didn't know very much about Rick Santorum despite the fact that the former Pennsylvania senator formally sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, winning nearly a dozen states.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham confirmed on Sunday that he was 'testing the waters' for a possible 2016 presidential campaign. 

'I am definitely going to look at it,' Graham, a rumored candidate for the GOP nomination, said on Meet the Press. 

'I think the world is falling apart, and I’ve been more right than wrong when it comes to foreign policy,' he said. 'But we’ll see.'

Graham is known for his hawkish views on foreign policy and his close friendship with 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain. 

Most popular among Republicans was Romney. Respondents said 59 percent to 26 percent that Romney should run again.

The former Massachusetts governor delivered a shock to the GOP presidential field after he indicated recently that he was interested in making a third attempt at the White House after losing to Barack Obama in the last election and Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008 during his party's primary. 

Bush came in second with a 50 percent approval rating for his likely presidential campaign. A Huckabee candidacy was the third most favored option  at 40 percent. 

No other Republicans even came close to the three frontrunners. Palin scored well with 30 percent of GOP respondents, Christie 29 percent, Paul 27 percent and Rubio 26 percent. All other Republican candidates included in the poll didn't make it above 25 percent. 

Not tested in the poll was South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said yesterday that he is 'testing the waters' for a 2016 run. 

Democratic politicians included in the survey were New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Clinton, outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Clinton continues to be popular with her party, earning the approval of 85 percent of Democratic respondents in the CBS poll. Biden was the most viable alternative with a 40 percent favorability rating. 

Progressive icon Elizabeth Warren was surprisingly unknown by 57 percent of Democrats. Just 23 percent said she should run for president.
