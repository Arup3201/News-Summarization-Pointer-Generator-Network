A Texas mother was arrested after she was caught on video pulling a gun on a teenage girl who was fighting her daughter in a public park.

Two female students from Pasadena High School in Houston confronted each other Tuesday afternoon, when one of the girls' mothers, Virianda Alvarez, showed up armed with a handgun.

According to school officials, Ms Alvarez, 33, aimed the gun at her daughter's rival and threatened her.

An armed officer with the Pasadena Independent School District showed up a short time later and broke up the fight.

Virianda Alvarez was arrested Tuesday night and charged with aggravated assault. She is being held on $35,000 bond.

During her first court appearance, Alvarez told a judge that she just wanted to 'scare' her daughter's rival with the gun, and her family later told the station KPRC2 that the weapon was not loaded.

The violent brawl broke out in the park across the street from Pasadena High School after class Tuesday, drawing a large crowd of spectators.

Victoria Myers, 14, told the station KHOU she got into a dispute with Virianda Alvarez's daughter over a boy, and then the girl’s friends challenged her to show up for a fight.

Footage from the fight shows the two classmates pummeling one another and pulling each other's hair 

Myers said she had no idea that her classmate's mother came to the park armed with a gun until she saw a friend's cell phone video, which captured the moment Ms Alvarez allegedly pointed the handgun at her head .

The shaky video, obtained by NBC DFW, begins with Victoria and her romantic rival standing in a circle of girls in the middle of the park, looking uncertain about what they are supposed to do next.

Then one of the teens in the crowd shoves Alvarez's daughter towards Victoria, and the two begin pummelling one another with their fists and pulling on each other's hair.

In the video, Victoria Alvarez throws her opponent to the ground and punches her several times in the face.

For a split second, Virianda Alvarez appears in the frame in a bright-pink shirt holding a black handgun pointed at the ground.

Punishment: Both girls have been suspended from school until Monday and ticketed 

Some of the spectators recorded the brawl on their cell phones, including the moment Ms Alvarez allegedly threatened an unsuspecting Victoria Myers with the gun.

By the time a school district officer showed up to stop the fight, Ms Alvarez had stuffed the weapon in her purse, according to witnesses.

The woman was identified and arrested only after videos and still photographs from the fight surfaced online and were brought to the attention of police.

Victoria Myers and Alvarez's daughter have been suspended from school until Monday. Both girls also received citations and will have to partake in a five-day guidance program.
