London could be plunged into riots again unless train and bus fares come down, the capital’s transport commissioner has said.

Sir Peter Hendy, head of Transport for London, said the city’s networks will face ‘overwhelming’ overcrowding by 2030 unless new rail lines are urgently built.

This could cause ‘social unrest’ and the sort of ‘trouble’ seen in Mumbai, where there have been protests over fare increases.

Billions of pounds are already been invested in London’s transport networks, but Sir Peter said a rapidly expanding population will put intolerable pressure on public transport.

He said an additional six million trips will be made in the capital each day by the end of the next decade.

Sir Peter, who is paid more than £300,000 a year, told The Guardian that low-paid workers now lived on the outskirts of the capital rather than in inner-city neighbourhoods - and there could be ‘social unrest’ if they could not easily commute around the city for work.

‘London’s poor don’t live in Harrow Road, they live in Enfield and Tolworth and if you can’t get them to jobs they want, your city’s going to be in a bad way: it’s not going to progress and contribute to national economic growth,’ Sir Peter said.

‘The stakes are pretty high. If you’re not able to increase transport capacity, and people find accessing work impossible, you risk social unrest. You can expect trouble.’

Bus fares have risen by more than 50 per cent in six years under the London mayor, Boris Johnson – a policy Sir Peter has backed.

But the transport commissioner warned fares could not continue to rise.

London’s population is officially estimated at 8.4million and is rising by about 80,000 people a year. It is expected to reach 10 million by 2030.

‘If you contemplate a London in 2030 without continuous investment and more revenue money, we will have the kind of congestion you’re looking at in Mumbai,’ he said.

Mumbai was one of several Indian cities that experienced protests over rail fare increases earlier this year, while more than a year of escalating demonstrations in Brazilian cities in the runup to the 2014 World Cup were ignited by fare rises on public transport.
