A petition to save a lonely polar bear which has been billed as 'the world's saddest animal' is to be delivered to Argentina’s President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.

More than 200,000 people have called for Arturo to be moved to a cooler climate after photos emerged of him sitting in a concrete enclosure at Mendoza Zoo in Argentina in temperatures of up to 40C (104F).

It is claimed the 29-year-old’s lonely life is causing him to display abnormal behaviour, including tilting his head and showing his teeth while pacing back and forth and rocking from side to side.

Flat out: Arturo sits in a concrete enclosure at Mendoza Zoo in Argentina in temperatures of up to 40C (104F) and is said to have been depressed since his long-term friend Pelusa died two years ago

Observations: Experts claim the 29-year-old's lonely life is causing him to display 'abnormal behaviour', including tilting his head and showing his teeth while pacing back and forth and rocking from side to side

Thick coat: Animal rights activists now want Arturo - whose only access to cooling water in his enclosure is said to be a pool just 20in (50cm) deep - moved to another zoo that offers cooler conditions

He is said to have been depressed since his long-term friend Pelusa died two years ago.

Arturo - Spanish for Arthur - has been
 at the zoo for two decades, and has had no contact with his own kind 
since Pelusa died. Now, campaigners are worried that he is suffering 
mental health issues.

US 
singer Cher, 68, said on Twitter: ‘Don’t cry for him, Argentina? No 
tears of Mrs Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner for tortured polar bear 
Arturo. Your hands are stained with his blood when he dies.’

Mendoza
 Zoo blocked an effort five months ago to move Assiniboine Park Zoo in 
Winnipeg, Canada - where a new International Polar Bear Conservation 
Centre is located, reported the Sunday People.

The
 zoo did not believe the bear would survive the two-day trip, with 
director Gustavo Pronotto saying the medical board had made a decision -
 and officials were keen to ‘avoid a big mistake’.

Not going: Greenpeace had gathered 160,000 signatures in a campaign to transfer Arturo urgently to Canada, which it said has weather that more closely resembles what occurs in his natural habitat

Heavy: At Mendoza Zoo, Arturo is served 33lbs (15kg) of meat per day, and all the fruit and vegetables he can eat. He also loves honey. And if his caretakers are late, Arturo growls to draw their attention

He added at the time that the bear was in ‘good condition’, explaining that the life expectancy of one of the animals is just over 20 years - but in captivity, they can often live to see the age of 30.

Mr Pronotto said: ‘We must avoid a big mistake, like his death during the trip or upon arrival. One must evaluate the risks carefully. He is old, and this would require many hours of anaesthesia.’

Greenpeace had gathered 160,000 signatures in a campaign to transfer Arturo urgently to Canada, which it said has weather that more closely resembles what occurs in his natural habitat.

Argentinian professor Fernanda Arentsen, who teaches at Université de Saint-Boniface in Winnipeg, has written to her government and the Canadian Embassy in Buenos Aires over the issue.

She told the Winnipeg Free Press last year: ‘You can see he is going crazy. He moves the way polar bears do when they are suffering a lot of stress.

Sad case: Arturo - Spanish for Arthur - has been at the zoo for two decades, and has had no contact with his own kind since Pelusa died. Now, campaigners are worried that he is suffering mental health issues

Campaign: US singer Cher, 68, said on Twitter: 'Don't cry for him, Argentina? No tears of Mrs Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner for tortured polar bear Arturo. Your hands are stained with his blood when he dies'

‘He has been filmed rocking back and forth in a way that signals distress. It breaks my heart to see it. I’m from Mendoza. I know how hot summer is. There is no way for him to escape the heat.

‘He looks so sad. He looks in pain. You can imagine a polar bear in the desert with a swimming pool 50cm deep. It’s difficult to watch this poor animal suffering and in pain.’

Arturo, a 900lb (400kg) bear born in the US in 1985, arrived in 1993 in Mendoza, a city of 120,000 at the foot of the Andes, known for its wine production.

At Mendoza Zoo, Arturo is served 33lbs (15kg) of meat per day, and all the fruit and vegetables he can eat. He also loves honey. And if his caretakers are late, Arturo growls to draw their attention.

As the zoo’s mascot, he has an air-conditioned 375 sq ft (35 sq metre) enclosure, a 5,400 sq ft (500 sq metre) beach and a swimming pool in which his guards throw blocks of ice to keep it cool.

A spokesman for Mendoza Zoo did not immediately respond to a MailOnline request for comment.
