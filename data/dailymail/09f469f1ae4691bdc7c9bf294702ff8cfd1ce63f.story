Cooking fresh meals instead of letting children eat junk prolongs their life by up to 13 years, celebrity chef Jamie Oliver says

Parents who cook fresh meals to prevent their children reaching for junk food can prolong their  lives by up to 13 years, celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has said.

Mr Oliver said children are not programmed to reach for fatty and sugary snacks, and so it is a parent’s job to make healthy food appealing.

He called for councils to ban junk food vendors near to schools, and said sugar should be taxed, with the money raised invested in food education.

Mr Oliver’s call to arms comes after shocking figures released last week show one in ten children are obese when they start primary school at the age of four or five.

The figures rises to one in five by the final year of primary school when they are ten or 11.

Obese children are more likely to remain obese as adults, shoring up problems such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, several types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. 

They are also at greater risk of suffering bone and joint problems, sleep apnoea, stigma because of their weight and developing low self-esteem as a result. 

Experts today wholeheartedly agreed with Mr Oliver's comments, saying parents have a responsibility to help their children avoid obesity. 

Speaking on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Mr Oliver said: ‘Kids are not born and programmed to pick up a nugget, or a burger.

‘So it’s our job to make salads, salsas, veg appealing and gorgeous.

‘If you can learn to cook you can save money and you will possibly put 11- 13 years on your children’s life.

‘Look at wholefoods, swap out regular pastas for whole wheat pastas. Get involved, have fun with food.

He added: ‘While councils still allow many, many junk food vendors to be outside schools we will have a problem.

‘While sugar can get into so much things without being taxed, and that money being put back into food education, we will have a problem.’

Tam Fry, of the Child Growth Foundation and National Obesity Forum told MailOnline Mr Oliver was 'absolutely right'. 

He said: ‘He’s bang on to call for fresh food rather than junk food.

‘We now know from very good research that the current activity of eating junk food as a young person is taking away eight years of life, and robs a person of 20 years of good health.

‘This is because you get so fat you acquire the problems associated with obesity.'

He added: ‘Children respond automatically to sweetness. That’s why sugar is used by the food industry to catch children young and keep them for life.

'Its parents’ responsibility to keep high-sugar foods off the menu. That’s why putting out fresh fruit and vegetables is so important.’

Mr Oliver's comments come as world experts meet in London for a summit on obesity, to discuss the best way of tackling the health epidemic. 

Mr Oliver's call to arms comes after shocking figures released last week show one in five children are obese when they leave primary school at age 11

Despite the known risks, official figures show nearly one in five children are obese when they leave primary school in the UK.

They also revealed children from deprived areas of England are twice as likely to be obese as those living in more affluent parts of the country.

The latest statistics for children aged 10 to 11 show that 24.7 per cent from low-income areas are obese, compared to 13.1 per cent in more affluent locations.

While 9.5 per cent of four to five year olds are obese, that figure doubles to 19 per cent by the time children leave primary school.

The data, published today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, relates to the 2013/14 school year.

Eustace de Sousa, national lead for children, young people and families at Public Health England (PHE), described the figures - which are for children in state schools - as 'deeply concerning'.  

Overall, obesity costs the UK economy £47 billion a year, more than armed violence, war and terrorism, according to a study by consultants McKinsey and Company.

Obesity has the second-largest economic impact on the UK, second only to smoking, they found. 

Children may be eating up to 70 teaspoons of sugar a day, a father warns. 

Worried about his children's sugar consumption, Richard Price kept a diary and calculated how much sugar his children ate over a seven-day period.

He found his children, Jessica and James, ate a total of 1.39kg of sugar - 334 teaspoons - in a week.

They managed to eat the equivalent of a bag-and-a-half of sugar each, nearly twice the safe amount of sugar. 

'Sugar is everywhere: from school dinners to snacks at after-school clubs and playdates,' he concluded.

It is now known to be a major contributing factor to obesity, diabetes and cancer, and Government guidelines suggest children of  should not consume more than 60g daily.

Some doctors have even  recommended intake should be halved to 30g a day — 210g a week.
