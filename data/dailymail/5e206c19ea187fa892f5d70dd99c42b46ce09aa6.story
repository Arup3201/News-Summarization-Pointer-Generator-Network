Legal action: Jack Straw, pictured leaving his London home today, is being sued by a Libyan military commander following allegations he personally permitted the rebel's illegal rendition

Former foreign secretary Jack Straw is facing the prospect of testifying on oath over allegations he permitted the illegal rendition of a Libyan military commander.

Lawyers representing Abdel Hakim Belhadj confirmed legal papers have been served on the Labour MP.

The move follows reports suggesting that Mr Straw had signed documents that allowed the rebel to be sent back to his homeland in 2004.

Mr Belhadj, 45, claims he had been 
living in exile in Beijing, China, before being detained with his wife 
Fatima while en route to Britain, where they were trying to seek asylum.

He alleges they were sent back to Libya - which was under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi - and imprisoned and tortured.

The civil action, which is against Mr 
Straw personally, seeks to examine his exact role in the rendition and 
claim damages from him for the trauma involved.

Mr Belhadj's lawyers, Leigh Day & Co, said they sent the MP a letter yesterday asking him to produce a number of documents.

They
include papers mentioned in a Sunday Times article which alleged that 
Mr Straw signed off the rendition, as well as his diaries, memoirs and 
notes from March 2004 onwards.

Sami
Al Saadi, who claims to have shared the same fate as fellow Libyan and 
Gaddafi opponent Mr Belhadj, is also taking legal action against Mr 
Straw.

Mr Belhadj, a key military figure in the uprising that toppled Gaddafi last year, is already suing the Foreign Office and MI6.

He
alleges that he was tortured by Gaddafi's regime after being rendered 
back to Libya via British-controlled Diego Garcia in 2004.

The
Metropolitan Police are already investigating the claims. British 
ministers have always denied any complicity in rendition or torture.

The Sunday Times reported at the weekend that Mr Straw had been confronted about the his alleged role by MI6.

Allegations: Abdel Hakim Belhadj suing the former foreign secretary

Sapna Malik, a partner at Leigh Day & Co, said: 'We have said all along that liability must follow the chain of command.

'These latest revelations bring us closer to that goal. If the former foreign secretary does not now own up to his role in this extraordinary affair, he will need to face the prospect of trying to defend his position in court.'

Cori Crider, legal director of 
Reprieve, said: 'At last it seems we know who signed off Britain’s 
involvement in rendition to torture.

'Jack Straw must come clean with Mr 
Belhadj, Mr al Saadi and their families. They deserve an apology for the
appalling way they were treated.'

She went on: 'It is now also totally 
unreasonable for the Government ‘neither to confirm nor deny’ its role 
in the al Saadi and Belhadj renditions.

'Yet this is their official position. 
What is left to be covered up, besides the reasons these terrible 
mistakes were made? The case needs to be fully examined - in the open.

'The British public deserve a full 
explanation of how their government sank so low as to become complicit 
in the rendition of children and pregnant women.'

Downing Street said it was 'looking 
closely' at the legal action brought against Mr Straw but declined to 
comment on the details of the case.

A spokeswoman said: 'The Government’s 
position on torture is well-known. We stand firmly against it and any 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. We do not condone 
that and we do not ask others to do it on our behalf.

'We take the allegations very 
seriously. What is important now is to ensure a fair trial and civil 
proceedings when people accuse the Government of mistreatment and seek 
compensation. That is one of the issues we are looking at as part of the
Security and Justice Green Paper.'
