The Queen Mary 2, one of the world's largest ocean liners, has been hit with two power failures that resulted in one passenger having to be rescued from an on-board lift, it was claimed today.

The ship known as the 'queen of the seas' arrived in Western Australia yesterday to start her maiden circumnavigation of the continent - but on the way across the Indian Ocean power outages caused problems.

One passenger, who asked not to be named, said he was stuck in a lift for about 10 minutes and had to be rescued after electricity failed for about 25 minutes and the engines stopped.

The Queen Mary 2 is scheduled to sail to Sydney on the next leg of its voyage, before heading north to Queensland, around the top of the continent and back to Fremantle on February 28

Other passengers, he said, peered over the side of the 151,400-ton vessel wondering what had happened when they realised the four diesel engines had stopped.

'We were stuck in the middle of the ocean without any power,' he told Australian media. 'It was an extraordinary series of events for a ship known as the queen of the seas.'

He said the second incident occurred in the early hours of Tuesday during moderately rough seas and strong winds during the liner's voyage from Port Louis, Mauritius, to Fremantle in Western Australia.

The vessel stopped for up to 10 minutes with the lights and TV going off for a moment and the engines failing to start up again for up to eight minutes.

Official statement: Mr David Jones, a spokesman for Carnival, which owns the 1132ft-long ship confirmed there had been 'brief power outages' but said these had occurred during routine maintenance

Mr David Jones, a spokesman for Carnival, which owns the 1132ft-long ship confirmed there had been 'brief power outages' but said these had occurred during routine maintenance.

'There was a brief power interruption and as expected would normally happen backup systems kicked in, so at all times there was full lighting and all controls were effective and operating normally,' he said.

Mr Jones said that passenger safety was not at risk and they would have barely noticed the interruption.

Australia's Maritime Safety Authority said it had received reports of a power outage from passengers during the first incident.

It was not the first time an alleged power failure has struck the ship.

In September 2010 a blackout followed a loud explosion as it approached Barcelona.

The Queen Mary 2 is scheduled to sail to Sydney on the next leg of its voyage, before heading north to Queensland, around the top of the continent and back to Fremantle on February 28.
