With just two days until the historic vote on Scottish independence, campaigners on both sides are doing everything they can to drum up crucial last-minute support.

But when a trio of celebrities egged-on crowds at an anti-independence campaign in London, critics were quick to question their motives - as none of the three speakers was Scottish.

Bob Geldof, Eddie Izzard and Al Murray pleaded with a packed Trafalgar Square last night to remain part of the 307-year-old union at a Let's Stay Together rally.

Twitter users were quick to express their bemusement, however, with one saying of Irish-born Geldof's involvement: 'I thought it was impossible for my mind to be anymore set.'

The campaign came as David Cameron flew to Aberdeen to beg Scots not to rip the United Kingdom apart, with opinion polls continuing to show the vote was far too close to call.

Bob Geldof appeared at the Better Together rally in Trafalgar Square, London, to the bemusement of many critics

The musician was joined by comedian Eddie Izzard who sported a Union Jack manicure as he told Scots: 'We care' 

Comedian Al Murray told the crowds which had gathered in London that he liked Britain as it was 'vague'

Mr Cameron appeared teary-eyed as he 
issued his most emotional plea yet to voters ahead of Thursday's vote: 
'Please don't break this family apart.'

Born in Ireland, Geldof said he had an 'immigrant's gratitude' to the union to which he owed 'everything'.

‘I
 keep hearing that one of the main reasons we’re having this argument is
 that the Scots are fed up with Westminster,' he told crowds. 

‘I’d like to tell them we’re all f******* fed up of Westminster.’

He added: ‘If I was Scottish I’d say why not, but I’m Irish so I say why? No is not always negative. 

'Before
 there was a United States, before there was a United Nations, before 
there was a united this, that and the other there was a United Kingdom 
and it was an extraordinary meeting of very different minds of two 
extremely close cousins.

'And
 what a construct this thing is. Because Scotland is a feeling. England 
is a feeling. Wales is a feeling, Ireland a feeling. 

'But
 the United Kingdom is one of the greatest ideas for the modern age. 
Between the native genius of the Scots and the pure pragmatic drive of 
the English we made a world beater. 

'The pity of this is that we are the closest of cousins – when one of our blood spills then it all spills.' 

Later he joined Michelle Mone and Brian Cox for a Newsnight referendum special. 

During the broadcast, he said: 'We need a new pact, but need to work that out together - not to go off in a huff.'

Some Twitter users were quick to criticise the trio's performance as none are in fact Scottish

Yemen-born Eddie Izzard took a softer 
approach at the rally yesterday, saying: 'If you care, this is the time 
to say it, to stand up, and if you care about the future of Scotland 
this is your time to show it.

'This is our time to show Scotland that we care. Today’s the day and they’re going to vote on Thursday. 

'To anyone in the United Kingdom the breaking up of the UK family is going to be a huge emotional wrench. 

'It’s
 for the Scottish people to decide, but I don’t know if they know how 
much the rest if the UK cares, so that’s why I think it’s a great thing 
to have at Trafalgar Square — otherwise how can they sense that?'

Presenter Dan Snow wore a 'let's stay together' t-shirt as he answered questions alongside Izzard at the rally

Critics were quick to point out that neither Izzard, Geldof or Murray were born in Scotland

Thousands of people turned out at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square this evening for the event

Meanwhile comedian Al Murray said what he liked most about Britain was that 'it's vague'. 

'I like being British, it's so vague. The clue is in the name Brit-ish. We're ish'. 

Critics in the Yes camp took to Twitter to express confusion at the line-up of non-Scottish speakers, however.

'What is 
Bob Geldof doing in Trafalgar Square? Is there anything this man won' 
get involved in?' one user wrote, while another said: 'You're missing 
the point. This isn't about you.' 

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was in attendance, tweeting a picture from the crowd that he was 'proud' to be a part of.
