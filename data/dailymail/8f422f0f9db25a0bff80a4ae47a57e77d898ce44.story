A British poker ace who disappeared from his Costa del Sol mansion and was being hunted by police for allegedly stealing more than €3million from investors, has been found living in Berkshire.

Playboy Nigel Goldman, 56, who counts James Hewitt and Sir Mark Thatcher among his social circle, is being investigated by the Guardia Civil and Action Fraud, the UK's fraud and internet crime reporting centre.

Earlier this year the only trace of Goldman since he vanished in Marbella, was a text message to a former employer three weeks ago which read: ‘I did not set out to be a thief.’

Spanish police were probing claims that the broker from Edgbaston in Birmingham, left people empty handed and unable to access their bank funds.

However police were unable to trace him after they received complaints about his Tangier-based company, International Financial Investment.

But now Goldman, who drove a red Ferrari, has been found living in a modest house in the picturesque village of Kintbury, Berkshire under the alias of Howard del Monte.

Ex-pat newspaper The Olive Press, based in Spain, tracked him down using details on his eBay account Bensons Emporium.

Goldman's lavish lifestyle seems to have been scaled down with his Ferrari being replaced with a Vauxhall Zafira

He uses the site to buy and sell coins, stamps and antiques.

When approached at his Berkshire home Goldman refused to comment and his lavish lifestyle seems to have been scaled down with his Ferrari being replaced with a Vauxhall Zafira.

But a neighbour said: ‘Everyone in the village knows he's Goldman, whatever name he goes under.’

Geoff Whitton, originally from Cornwall, is trying to locate €20,000 he says he handed to Goldman.The 49-year-old writer said: ‘If he's a legitimate businessman, why hasn't he contacted me?

‘I gave €10,000 in May, 2012, and €10,000 two months later. Goldman made me a profit for two months, then a loss for the same amount.

‘For the next one-and-a-half years, I was in limbo. He'd say, "Just trust me and you will receive a profit in October 2013".’

Goldman, who enjoys swigging champagne and smoking expensive cigars, has a history of dishonesty, in his own book, 'High Stakes: How I Blew £14 million' published in 2006, he confesses being sent to prison twice for fraud.

A review on his book reads: ‘Goldman seems to show little remorse - and more than a little contempt - for the victims whose money he lived off so handsomely.’

Despite his past, Goldman is claiming that he, and others, have been duped this time and believes his brokers were running a Ponzi scheme with everyone's money.

A Ponzi scheme is an investment operation that pays returns to its investors from existing capital or new capital paid by new investors, rather than from profit earned by the individual or organisation running the operation.

Goldman has admitted in writing to owing as much as £658,000 (€800,000). However a lawyer acting for investors who claim to have lost cash is stating that he is chasing €3 million, a figure rising daily.

Flashy Goldman made his name at some of the world's biggest poker tournaments around the world, winning thousands.

Lawyer Antonia Flores, said: ‘So far we have spoken to victims in Almeria, Malaga and Jaen.

‘In our most recent estimate it looks like reaching €3 million.

‘The first thing he did right was openly admit to all his wrongdoings and say he paid for it and was a new man.

‘That was a success. People could not talk about his past, people actually felt sorry for him.

‘It is large scale, police have not yet issued an arrest warrant, but they are not far from doing that.’

Goldman offered investments in a host of commodities including bullion, stocks and shares although he is not a regulated financial advisor due to his criminal convictions.

Roger Parks, a neighbour and friend of Goldman said that he even tried to get him to invest, although he chose not to, he said: ‘I have known him for 35 years.

‘When he showed me the prospectus for International Financial Investments at his palatial rented home in Elviria a few months ago, I couldn't stopped laughing.

‘By the way, has anyone else noted the initials of his company spell IFI, as if 'iffy'?’

A spokesman for Auction fraud confirmed complains had been lodged with the organisation about Goldman.

If those complaints are upheld, information gathered will be passed to either the Metropolitan Police or Fraud Investigation Bureau.
