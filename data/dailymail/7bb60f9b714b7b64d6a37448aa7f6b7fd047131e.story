People are constantly advised to stay hydrated every day by drinking plenty of water.

But sometimes time just slips away, and it can be hours before someone realises they’ve forgotten to take just a sip.

So with that in mind, Vittel has invented a simple yet effective bottle cap with an in-built ‘alarm’ that you can set to remind you when to drink.

The Vittel Refresh Cap was designed by French marketing agency Oglivy Paris.

At first glance it might look just like a regular bottle cap.

Many dieters attempt to fill themselves up with water in the belief it will help them lose weight.

But one nutrition expert says it is simply a myth that drink water aids slimming.

Dr Beth Kitchin, at the University of Alabama, has stated that drinking water is not a magical key to weight loss.

She said: ‘There is very little evidence that drinking water promotes weight loss - it is one of those self-perpetuating myths.'

But closer inspection remains the small ‘timer’ band beneath the top.

To use the cap, it is screwed like normal onto the top of a regular bottle.

When it is screwed in place, though, a timer is set in motion.

After an hour it activates a little spring inside the cap the causes a flag at the top to pop up, grabbing a person’s attention.

The cap has been part of an experiment to see if it encourages people to hydrate more often.

According to agency Oglivy Paris, initial findings ‘show people drank more water during the day and enjoyed it.’

As of yet there is no news as to whether this will be made commercial for the general public.
