Conduct: Dr Peter Rubin is facing being struck off after he was found guilty of sexual misconduct by a Medical Practitioners Tribunal in Manchester

A GP who had sex with a mother-of-two in his surgery faces being struck off after he was found guilty of sexually-motivated conduct when he asked a female student to kiss him.

Married Dr Peter Rubin, 53, bought gifts for the woman in her 40s, bombarded her with personal texts and made inappropriate comments in a ‘long campaign to woo her’, a tribunal heard.

The pair had sex at the Woodlands Medical Centre, in Didcot, Oxfordshire on Christmas Eve 2007 before Dr Rubin prescribed the morning after pill and said: ‘You had better take this or it will be just my luck you will be standing in an antenatal clinic’.

The affair cooled off in 2008, but the woman, known only as Patient A, reported the shamed family doctor to the General Medical Council when he tried to ‘forcibly remove her trousers’ during a consultation four years later.

Dr Rubin is accused of misconduct at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, where he faces being struck off.

He also admitted that he joked ‘come back in or your boyfriend will have to have lots of cold showers’ when a 21-year-old student, referred to as Patient B, asked for the contraceptive pill.

The GP then asked her to kiss him on the cheek in a ‘spur of the moment’ light hearted gesture, which he claimed was not sexually motivated.

The girl’s ‘horrified’ mother reported him to the surgery in July 2011 and ‘devastated’ Dr Rubin was forced to apologise.

German-born Dr Rubin blamed the incident on his ‘foreign sense of humour’, but the fitness to practise panel, chaired by Dr Peter Jefferys, today ruled his conduct was ‘sexually motivated’.

Dr Jefferys told the medic: ‘In evidence you said that there was no motivation in your conduct, it was a light hearted gesture.

‘You said that you accept that it was wholly inappropriate.

‘The panel considered that it was wholly inappropriate to make any comment about the sexual activity of Patient B’s boyfriend.

‘The panel considered that in the context of having just made such an inappropriate remark about her boyfriend to a young woman asking for contraceptive advice and then inviting her to kiss you, your conduct was sexually motivated.’

The GP, who was suspended in November 2012 and left the practice the following month, admitted to the affair with Patient A, but denied some of her claims.

The panel, announcing their findings today, also found the outstanding allegations found proved after finding the woman was an ‘honest witness’.

She had been registered at the surgery since 2000, but said her friendship with Dr Rubin began to develop in the summer of 2007 after he gave her his phone number in Tesco.

The doctor hugged her during a consultation in July and asked: ‘Why don’t any of my patients wear nice underwear?’

The pair later exchanged phone numbers and began to exchange text and photo messages. He sent her a picture of an Anne Summers’ shop window and she sent a full-nude shot, the panel heard.

She received a ‘strange’ package, which her partner, the father of her daughter, opened, containing an un-signed birthday card, mobile phone and SIM card, which the doctor later admitted sending after getting her details from medical records.

Dr Rubin invited her to a ‘very uncomfortable’ lunch at a hotel in central Reading where he told her he intended to buy her a Christmas present and she decided to return the favour.

Allegations: After having sex with the patient on Christmas Eve, 2007, Dr Rubin prescribed the morning after pill and said: 'You had better take this or it will be just my luck you will be standing in an antenatal clinic'

She told the panel that the medic arranged a Christmas Eve appointment to exchange presents on the pretext of her being ill and seduced her.

Giving evidence she said: ‘I just felt uncomfortable there. We were the only two people there in the whole of the surgery.

‘It was just low lighting. I guess at that stage he started making passes towards me.

‘I felt like I did at the restaurant. I froze. I didn’t go there for that sort of encounter. I had gone there simply to exchange presents.

‘He just kept pestering me and in the end he got his own way. I was not participating,’ she said.

‘He was very strong and forceful. Afterwards he then announced he had something to do on the computer before I could go.

‘He had already given me an antibiotic prescription and said you need to take this one and said it’s the morning after pill.’

She added: ‘I received a Christmas text from him, which I didn’t open and I didn’t want. I was very angry and didn’t want anything to do with him at all.’

He sent another text to apologise in which he referred to himself as a ‘bastard’ who always puts himself first, the panel heard.

The Irish-trained GP continued to bombard her with texts and paid visits to her house during working hours, the tribunal was told.

On one occasion in 2008 he ‘put her on the kitchen table’ in her partner’s house, which she shared with her two children, and started ‘fondling’ her, it was said.

The GP insists that the relationship was entirely consensual and claims his mistress willingly had sex on several occasions at her home.

‘Some visits we just had coffee and a chat for half an hour. On some of them we had intercourse. The relationship was very intense,’ the doctor said, giving evidence.

The relationship ‘fizzled out’ in 2008, although some text contact continued, and Dr Rubin was not reported until 2012 after an appointment with Patient A after she had a horse riding accident.

Dr Rubin now says he knows the fling was ‘unacceptable and inappropriate’ and vows not to repeat his mistakes.

He said: ‘It is an experience I do not wish to repeat. I am sorry for what happened and thoroughly ashamed and with the best will in the world I will do what I can to make sure this doesn’t happen again.’

Dr Rubin trained at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin before working at a number of hospitals in the UK.

He qualified as a GP in 1990 and joined the Woodlands practice in 1998. The hearing, which is expected to last until April 8, continues.
