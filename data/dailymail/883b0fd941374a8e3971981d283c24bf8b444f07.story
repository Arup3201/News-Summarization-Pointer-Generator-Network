With prices in excess of Â£5000 for breast augmentation, its no surprise that 43 per cent of British people say they would go abroad in search of cheaper surgery.

But it doesn't always have quite the results expected, as Nicole Burnett, 30, a call centre worker from Glasgow, knows only too well.

Not only did her quest for cut-price surgery leave her with sagging breasts in two different sizes, it left her with an infection so severe, it continued to rage even after the offending implants had been removed.

Upset: Nicole was unhappy with her sagging breasts but a botched boob job abroad proved a catastrophe

Nicole's problems began when she dropped three cup sizes after losing weight and found herself unhappy and embarrassed by her newly diminutive assets.

'I used to go to the gym in padded bras and put sports bras on top of them so people wouldn't notice the sagging in my breasts,' she says.

'The relationship I was in at the time suffered because I wouldn't remove my bra, even when going to bed at night and when I took my bra off, it didn't feel right because my breasts were sagging like an old woman's.'

Her solution was implants but with the cost of breast augmentation surgery coming in at Â£5,000 or more, she decided to look abroad for a cheaper surgeon.

'When I looked into having surgery done abroad, I found I could get exactly what I wanted at less cost,' she explains.

Heartbreaking: Nicole weeps after being told just how badly damaged her breasts are

She contacted a clinic in Turkey and was initially impressed by both their professionalism and the results of her operation.

'The
 company I chose to go with responded to me really quickly and said I would be cared for in a luxury hotel,' she reveals.

'They 
told me about the sights, how it was relaxing, how I could have a bit of
 a holiday while I was there. They'd give me a 100 per cent guarantee 
that I'd be happy.'

And at first, Nicole was indeed thrilled with the results of her implant surgery. 'I was amazed by the results,' she confesses.

'They [the new breasts] were 
perfect - exactly what I was looking for. They looked great and I thought
 that was the start of a new me.'

But her happiness was to prove short lived and just three weeks after returning, the problems began in earnest.

'The right breast had really started to 
grow in size and the left breast scar had opened up and had started to 
look kind of yellowy,' reveals Nicole.

Miserable: Nicole's breast surgery happened after she lost lots of weight and dropped three cup sizes

Damage: The scar beneath her left breast became badly infected leaving her with fat necrosis inside it 

'There was a lot of pain and some leakage started coming out.
 Over the course of the next couple of days, things just kept getting worse. The
 right breast was huge and it felt so sore, it felt like it was going to
 burst.'

She was rushed to hospital where doctors discovered that a pocket of fluid had developed in her right breast, while a severe infection was burning through her left.

Both implants, said medics, would have to be removed. For Nicole, who'd had to work two jobs to afford the original surgery, it was a severe blow.

'I couldn't stop crying,' she remembers. 'Everything I'd worked so hard to get was being taken away from me.'

Worse, not only were her breasts left saggier than before, they were two different sizes with the right far bigger than the left.

Upsetting: Nicole was left with different-sized breasts and a rampant infection following the bungled surgery

'My breasts looked worse than what 
they ever did before,' she adds. 'I'm at an age where I should be happy and settling down 
but it's taken away the happy bit.'

Since having the implants removed, Nicole has been to see a cosmetic surgeon in this country, where she was told that due to rotting fat left behind by the implants, a further set would be unwise.

Instead, she was given surgery to even up her breasts and to remove any remaining pockets of infection.

Although disappointed, Nicole is resigned and says she won't be having surgery again. 'I think it would be for my best interests to be safe and healthy,' she explains, 'rather than having another implant put in.'
