An Olympic silver medalist who dedicated his win to his dead mother and sister has been charged with two counts of assault following a late night brawl in Birmingham.

The 23-year-old boxer will appear before Birmingham Magistrates' Court on April 17 following an alleged incident in the city in the early hours of February 23.

Evans, from Old St Mellons, Cardiff, was arrested the same day and charged.

Boxer and Olympic silver medalist Fred Evans has been charged with two counts of assault following a late night brawl in Birmingham

Evans was bailed to appear for an initial hearing before Birmingham Magistrates' Court, and is due in court again on April 17.

The charge comes after the Welshman was awarded a silver medal for his performance in London 2012.

After the win, Evans' granfather, also Fred Evans, 78, said that the family were 'proud as can be'.

He described his grandson as a 'very quiet but a nice lad'.

At London 2012, the boxer dedicated the medal to his dead mother and sister.

The Welsh boxer, who was brought up in Pyle, near Bridgend, on a caravan park, lost his mother, Tracy, 39, and four-year-old sister Scarlett when they were killed during a car crash in 2006 in Cardiff.

Regarding the charges, a spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'We arrested a 23-year-old from Old St Mellons, Cardiff, on February 23, who gave his occupation as a boxer.

'He was charged later that day with two counts of assault in Birmingham City Centre in the early hours.'

A spokesman for the British Amateur Boxing Association said: 'We are aware of impending legal proceedings concerning a member of the GB Boxing Podium squad and are in the process of conducting an inquiry into this as part of our athlete disciplinary procedure.'

The Welsh Amateur Boxing Association declined to comment.

Evans' grandfather also Fred Evans, 78, described the boxer as a 'very quiet but a nice lad'

Evans joined the Great Britain squad in 2009. He reached the finals at the London 2012 games but lost 17-9 to Serik Sapiyev, from Kazakhstan.

The 23-year-old said that he boxed despite being urged to stay out of the ring after doctors warned that his hands were too badly damaged.

He became Wales' first boxer to win Olympic Silver. Dedicating the medal to his sister and mother he said: 'They would be over the moon for me and this medal is for them.

'I feel mixed emotions when I go into the ring. I know my mum is watching over me and will have been watching every fight here in London.

'All the hard work has paid off and made it all worthwhile.'
