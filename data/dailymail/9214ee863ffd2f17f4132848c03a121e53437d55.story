A woman who allegedly killed her boyfriend's toddler daughter by force-feeding her chilli powder as a punishment has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and assault.

Amanda Sorensen, 21, is now being held on $1 million bail after the death of two-year-old Joileen Garcia at the family's home in Apple Valley, California on Sunday.

She has been charged with one count of murder and another count of child abuse causing death, according to the complaint filed by the San Bernardino district attorney's office.

Police were called to the home at 4.16pm on Sunday as the girl suffered a seizure after ingesting the chilli powder.

Authorities have not revealed why the
young girl was allegedly forced to eat the powder, but the criminal 
complaint notes she acted with 'malice aforethought'.

The toddler was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead.

An investigation is ongoing, a 
sheriff's spokeswoman said, and an autopsy will be carried out to 
determine the exact cause of death.

She is scheduled to return to court January 17.

Sorensen, who is believed to have her own young daughter, is being held at the West Valley Detention Center.

Chilli's
main ingredient Capsaicin is an irritant in humans and other mammals, 
causing a burning sensation in the tissues with which it comes into 
contact.

Airway resistance increases following inhalation of capsaicin in both mild asthmatics and non-asthmatic people.

Capsaicin
can be fatal in large quantities. Symptoms of overdose include 
difficulty breathing, convulsions, and changes in skin colour.

'We felt the evidence supported the 
charges,' said Kathleen DiDonato, a prosecutor with the San Bernardino 
County district attorney's office.

DiDonato's boss, District Attorney Michael Ramos, recently formed a unit focused on prosecuting major crimes against children.

Ramos cited the difficulty in 
prosecuting such cases because often there are no witnesses and children
sometimes are unable to testify. There were more than 30 crimes against
children last year in San Bernardino County that includes murder, 
assault and torture. In 2011, there were more than 50 such crimes.

'It's sad to say we need a major crimes against children unit for this reason,' DiDonato said of the chili powder case.

In court on Thursday, a man identifying himself to NBC Los Angeles as the boyfriend of Joileen's biological mother said she was devastated.

'She's just broken down,' Manuel Lopez said.

Lopez added that he had raised the young girl since she was 18 months old and thought of himself as her father.

'Early in the morning, she would 
always jump into bed with us. She went with us everywhere,' Lopez said.

'Bright kid, smart, intelligent, running around. ... She loved animals 
and horses.'

Neighbors told KTLA that they have 
previously witnessed abuse at the home, which was scattered with toys 
when police took the mother away.

'They fight like crazy,' one man told the channel.

But other neighbors told NBC San Diego that 
they didn't notice anything unusual about the house and would see 
several children from toddlers to teenagers entering and leaving the 
home.

'I would give them the benefit of the
doubt,' Patricia Amado said. 'I can't imagine a parent 
purposely doing something like that to a young child.'

If a baby ingests chilli powder it can swell the airways and cause them to stop breathing.

Chilli's main ingredient Capsaicin is
an irritant in humans and other mammals, causing a burning sensation in
the tissues with which it comes into contact.

Capsaicin
temporarily causes bronchoconstriction, coughing, nausea, and 
a lack of coordination in the upper body afterÂ  inhalation.

Airway resistance increases following inhalation of capsaicin in both mild asthmatics and non-asthmatic people.

Chili powder can be fatal in large quantities. Symptoms of an overdose include 
difficulty breathing, convulsions and changes in skin colour.
