Ashley Barnes will not face retrospective action from the Football Association following his challenge on Nemanja Matic during Burnley's draw at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

The Burnley striker caught the Serbia international with a dangerous studs-up tackle prompting Matic to retaliate by pushing Barnes to floor, earning the Chelsea midfielder a red card.

The FA confirmed on Monday that because the incident was seen by referee Martin Atkinson during the game no further action could be taken.

'Retrospective action introduced as deterrent for ‘off the ball incidents’ [e.g. kicks, stamps etc.] committed out of sight of officials,' the FA tweeted.

'In line with this rationale, FA confirm no further action in relation to Ashley Barnes as incident was seen by the officials.' 

Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho is unlikely to face FA punishment despite his extensive criticism of refereeing decisions during his appearance on Goals on Sunday.

The Chelsea manager expressed his grievances in light of Chelsea’s draw with Burnley at Stamford Bridge when Nemanja Matic was sent off and the home side were refused two penalty claims by Martin Atkinson.

Mourinho was angered by Ashley Barnes's studs up tackle on Matic – as well as his foul on Branislav Ivanovic – calling the Burnley player’s actions ‘criminal’. The Portuguese also pointed to previous incidents when calls had gone against his team, describing them as ‘too much’.

He himself brought up the risk his comments could result in sanction from the FA, suggesting he may be banned from the dugout for the Capital One Cup final, but insisted he was not attacking referees’ integrity and simply being honest.

In January Mourinho was fined £25,000 and warned about his future conduct for bringing the game into disrepute by claiming there was a ‘campaign’ against Chelsea.

The FA are aware of his latest observations on officiating, but it is believed he has selected his words carefully enough to avoid punishment this time.

Mourinho said during the programme on Sky Sports: ‘I cannot go too far but the reality is the incidents I'm speaking [about] week after week is exactly because it is week after week. I know football is football and in football sometimes you have and sometimes you don't have. But I think it's too much. My players are not getting the respect they deserve. 

The Chelsea manager was not happy with several decisions during Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Burnley

'At Southampton, the penalty, transformed in a free-kick and a yellow card to Cesc Fabregas. The penalty against Tottenham, handball with [Jan] Vertonghen, against Liverpool, red cards for Liverpool, penalties, it's too much. It's too much.

'If you're asking me about five points difference, I would say to you if we are in a normal situation where the mistakes are part of the game and sometimes go in our favour and sometimes go against us, in this moment it wouldn't be five, it would be 12. Because we are speaking about two points at Southampton, three points at Tottenham. We are speaking about many, many incidents.

'Probably now I'm risking my dugout in the final because maybe tomorrow I have the risk of being suspended because I'm having this conversation. 

'I'm not attacking honesty, the dignity of anyone. I'm not trying to - and in this country you love this sentence - bring the game into disrepute. This is what they use when they want to punish me. I'm trying just to be honest.

'They [the referees] are trying but they are not doing well. They are trying. Of course, they are trying. What I would improve? If the referee cannot see a penalty three metres in front of him, some official in front of a screen cannot miss it.

'If we want to protect the integrity and honesty of the referees, if we want to believe that the mistake is a consequence of a misinterpretation, of a bad position, of unpredictability of the situation and the game, I think technology can help.’
