A £16 computer designed to help children learn how to write code has sold out across the US within hours.

The Raspberry Pi, manufactured in Pencoed just outside Cardiff, has become a huge hit among both children and adults since in launched across Europe in February.

The gadget went on sale on Monday in the 
U.S. through retailer Allied Electronics, but the cheapest version, 
costing just £16 (£25) is already out of stock.

The Raspberry Pi is a tiny no-frills computer that was designed to get children interesting in the nuts and bolts of computing.

Costing just £16, it comes with a processor that uses the ARM architecture, a British technology that is particularly good for small, light battery-operated devices.

The Raspberry Pi arrives without a case or any other peripherals: you have to add a keyboard and mouse, and plug it into a computer screen or your TV.

You also have to load the operating system yourself.

It can run a special version - or 'distro' - of Linux, the open-source operating system, called Raspbian.

There's even a version of Google's Android for the Raspberry Pi.

The A version of the computer, which 
only costs £16 ($25), has 256MB of RAM, a single USB 2.0 socket, an HDMI, SD 
card, and 3.5 audio sockets, but no Ethernet port.

The £22 ($35) Raspberry Pi B has 512MB of RAM, two USB 2.0 sockets and an Ethernet port.

The tiny gadget has already sold a million units in Europe, and its creators hope it will become a global hit.

Co-founder Eben Upton, who says his 
job is like getting paid to play with digital Lego all day, says the 
Raspberry Pi Foundation initially planned a run of only 10,000 when it 
was launched in 2009.

'The fact we have sold out in the US is very satisfying,' he told MailOnline.

‘We did not set this up to sell 
computers, we set it up because we realised since the Eighties and 
Nineties young people have fewer opportunities to learn to programme 
computers,’ he said.

The firm also recently moved production back to the UK.

'We are manufacturing in Pencoed, in Wales, at the 
Sony UK Technology Centre, after we discovered we could build at the 
same cost in the UK,' said Upton.

'We're building a few thousand a week of the cheaper version, 
compared to tens of thousand of the more expensive model, but we may 
change that now,' he said.

'It turns out people are very enthusiastic and demand has been satisfying high.'

The co-founders had the idea after meeting at Cambridge University.

The low-cost computer – available as a £16 or £22 model – plugs into a TV and has ports for a keyboard and mouse.

'The
idea behind a tiny and cheap computer for kids came in 2006, when Eben 
Upton and his colleagues at the University of Cambridge’s Computer 
Laboratory, including Rob Mullins, Jack Lang and Alan Mycroft, became 
concerned about the year-on-year decline in the numbers and skills 
levels of the A Level students applying to read Computer Science in each
academic year,' the firm says on its website.

It has been hailed across the industry as a key way to attract students to programming.

How the Raspberry Pi works

Earlier this year the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced more than 15,000 children in the UK will be given one of their iconic microcomputers for free, thanks to a donation from Google Giving.

Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman, Google, said: 'Britain’s innovators and entrepreneurs have changed the world - the 
telephone, television and computers were all invented here.

'We've been 
working to encourage the next generation of computer scientists and we 
hope this donation of Raspberry Pi’s to British school pupils will help 
drive a new wave of innovation.'

Despite technology being one of the world’s fastest growing industries, the teaching of computer science in schools has been in decline.

Over the last decade, the number of people studying computer science in the UK dropped by 23% at undergraduate level, and by 34% at graduate level.

This at a time when the UK needs more computer scientists than ever.
