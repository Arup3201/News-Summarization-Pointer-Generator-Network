It started out as delicate - and as small - as a tiny china teacup.

But there is nothing delicate about this rampant houseplant now - after it has enjoyed a fantastic growth spurt every year for half a decade.

Gloria Baptist-Smith was given this red Clivia - an African species of plant - as a present seven years ago.

And for the first two, its blooms remained decidedly manageable as the houseplant unobtrusively stayed in its diminutive terracotta home.

But five years ago the plant began enjoying phenomenal growth - and has to be contained by a huge plastic bucket after it shot up to be almost five feet tall.

Huge: The blooms, which last for around three weeks, are astonishingly large

Ms Baptist-Smith, from Burgess Hill in West Sussex, was astonished by the progress her pot plant has made - especially as she confesses to being far from green-fingered.

She said: 'I'm not terribly good with plants, and I didn't expect anything really to come of it.

'For a while it just seemed to be fine, then suddenly, over the last five years or so, it has grown almost a foot every year.

'The bright red blooms it produces are bigger than my head. It reminds me of a triffid - the blooms are just massive.'

Clivia are a species native to South Africa and Swaziland. They are a popular houseplant which are - in general - easy to maintain.

According to the Chicago Botanic Garden, if cared for correctly the plants will burst into colour right in the very depths of winter.

However, the plants are slow to grow, and often take several years to lay their roots before they are capable of springing up as Ms Baptist-Smith's specimen appears to have done.

It is not unusual for a Clivia to reach heights of two or three feet once fully mature.
