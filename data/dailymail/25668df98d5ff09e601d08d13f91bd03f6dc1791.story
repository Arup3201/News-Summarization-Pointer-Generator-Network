There must have been occasions during the last two years when Alan Hutton wondered whether matches like this had passed him by.

Cut from the Aston Villa squad, he went on loan to Nottingham Forest, Real Mallorca and Bolton. At one stage he was only getting competitive games for Scotland.

Fitting, then, that his well-taken goal completed a comeback for his team as well as underlining his personal redemption.

Hutton was the central figure in this fractious contest, defending well, scoring and then being fortunate to stay on the pitch following a charged altercation with Paul Konchesky 10 minutes from the end. Reacting to a jibe delivered as he lay on the turf following a sliding foul, he sprang up and pushed his forehead into the Leicester City defender, who pressed back. Referee Craig Pawson reached the surprising conclusion that Konchesky should see red and Hutton only yellow.

It ensured the 30-year-old was able to fully enjoy his first Villa goal since signing in 2011, adding to Ciaran Clark’s first-half equaliser. Villa are unbeaten in five and up to 11th in the Premier League.

For bottom-placed Leicester, this was their 10th match without a win since beating Manchester United 5-3 in September. It was also the third match in a week when they have scored first but lost.

Paul Konchesky has now been sent off while playing for four different Premier League teams. Only Carlton Palmer has been dismissed for five. 

Villa deserved this win, and Leicester owe much to Kasper Schmeichel for keeping the deficit to one. Nigel Pearson accepted this but added that the club may appeal against the sending off. 

He said: ‘We were initially led to believe it was for the challenge but I think now it is about the clash of heads. He’s not the instigator. The prudent thing is to see what’s in the report. But I think it’s difficult to have a decision like that rescinded.’

Leicester fans clapped their team and manager off. ‘I do appreciate their frustrations and hope they stick with the side,’ Pearson added. ‘You can see our players are committed and do care.’

Esteban Cambiasso  90        11.6           7.2

In the 13th minute, Leonardo Ulloa poked in his first goal since the remarkable victory over United that is an ever-fading memory. Riyad Mahrez cut in from the right and hit a shot that deflected off Clark. Brad Guzan spilled straight to the feet of the Argentine striker.

Five minutes later, Gabby Agbonlahor won a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Westwood delivered the ball into a congested six-yard box and Liam Moore allowed Clark to find space far too easily. The Irish defender headed home for his first Villa goal since September 2012. 

The match ended with four bookings per side. Five minutes before the interval, Jamie Vardy launched into a tackle from behind that left Ashley Westwood in a heap holding his left knee. Westwood was stretchered from the field with his head in his hands. He will undergo a scan on Monday with Lambert suggesting it could be ligament damage.

Clark took immediate retribution, sliding in hard on Ulloa by the touchline. It was fair but Ulloa was replaced by David Nugent at half-time. In the second half, chances fell for Villa like confetti. Christian Benteke was put clear by Kieran Richardson in the 53rd minute but was thwarted by the excellent Schmeichel, who then stopped Agbonlahor with his legs.

Substitute Jack Grealish crossed to Benteke, the Belgian connected well, but again the Leicester goalkeeper was equal to it. He also saved from Grealish and Agbonlahor again but was powerless against Hutton 19 minutes from time.

Agbonlahor fed Benteke, who crossed deep. Hutton controlled on his chest then prodded past Schmeichel - the first Villa goal at the Holte End since April 5.

‘I hope it’s not such a long wait again,’ said Lambert. ‘Alan is playing as well as any right back in the country. He’s been as good as gold. I’m delighted for him. He has nothing to prove.’
