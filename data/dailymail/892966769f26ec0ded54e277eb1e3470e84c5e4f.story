A former fashion model and actress says Bill Cosby made sexual advances and lewd gestures toward her on the set of The Cosby Show.

Helen Gumpel, formerly known as Helen Selby, says Cosby had her sit on a couch in his dressing room, where he handed her a drink then stood in front of her with his crotch in her face.

Gumpel held a news conference in Boston on Sunday. A Cosby spokesman didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Former fashion model and actress Helen Gumpel - formerly Helen Selby - says Bill Cosby made sexual advances and lewd gestures toward her

The 77-year-old entertainer faces sexual assault accusations from at least 15 women. He has denied the allegations and has never been charged with a crime.

Also Sunday, Cosby canceled back-to-back comedy shows at the Wilbur Theater where demonstrators threatened to rally. He told the Boston Globe he canceled because of impending 'treacherous' weather. 

The Wilbur Theater posted an announcement on its website on Sunday morning. The theater apologized for the short notice but didn't give any more information.

A spokesman for Cosby, who has a home in western Massachusetts, did not respond to requests for comment.

Several Boston-area women's groups had said they planned to gather outside the theater and called for the cancellation of Cosby's two Sunday shows.

The cancellations come as New England is in the midst of another snowstorm expected to bring nearly two feet of snow to the Boston area through to Tuesday.

Cosby faces sexual assault accusations from at least 15 women, with some of the claims dating back decades. He denies the allegations and has never been charged with a crime. 

Some of his performances elsewhere have drawn heckling and protests. Some have been canceled but none as abruptly as Sunday's.

Wilbur Theater owner Bill Blumenreich said he had been planning to tighten security inside and outside the venue as a precaution.
