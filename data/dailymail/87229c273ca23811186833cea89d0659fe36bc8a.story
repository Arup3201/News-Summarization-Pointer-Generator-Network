A young mother who lost her parents and sister to cancer has refused tests for the disease - because she fears being handed a death sentence.

Diana Barrett, 22, has been advised to have checks after both her parents died from bowel cancer and her sister was killed by a brain tumour.

But despite losing her entire family to the disease, the mum-of-one said she would rather live in blissful ignorance than be told she is doomed to develop the disease.

'I know people will think it is irresponsible but the truth is after everything that has happened to my family I am terrified at the prospect of what doctors might say,' she said.

'I would rather not know.'

Miss Barrett, from Coleford, Gloucester, was only eight years old when her father Robert, 35, passed away from bowel cancer, aged 35, in 2001.

Nine years later her mother, Tracey, 40, developed the same disease and died on Mother's Day in March 2009.

In a final cruel twist, Miss Barrett's sister Sherrie developed a brain tumour in 2011 and lost her battle with the disease last year, aged 26.

The mother to one-year-old Darcy, said: 'Nothing can prepare you for losing a mother or father but I lost everyone I loved so young.

'I've been dealt a bad hand but have managed to keep going.

'When I held Darcy in my arms for the first time I felt an overwhelming amount for love for him.

'He gives me a purpose in life. We're a little family but we're a happy one.'

When their dad died, Miss Barrett was comforted by older sister Sherrie and the family briefly found happiness when mum Tracey met a new partner and had two more children.

But in late 2007, when Miss Barrett was just 14, Tracey, 40, a doll maker, was diagnosed with colon cancer after she started having pains in her lower back.

In the weeks that followed, her mum underwent keyhole surgery, radiotherapy and chemo. Tracey survived Christmas and died on Mother's Day in March 2009.

She said: 'I was devastated. I couldn't believe I'd lost both my parents. It was impossible to take in and I started suffering from panic attacks.'

The grieving sisters had happier news when Sherrie found out she was expecting her first child, but it was short-lived when 36 weeks into the pregnancy Sherrie started to suffer from severe headaches and an MRI scan revealed she had a brain tumour.

She said: 'They told her she had a rare brain tumour the size of a pear. They said it was life-threatening and had to perform an emergency c-section so they could operate on the tumour.'

Fortunately, her baby boy was delivered healthy weighing 7.3lbs.

Miss Barrett herself fell pregnant in February 2013 after a whirlwind romance and while the pregnancy wasn't planned, she was thrilled and couldn't wait to start a family.

She said: 'I was over the moon but also terrified to bring a baby into the world in case I or the baby suffered the same fate as my family.'

Less than two weeks after Miss Barrett gave birth in November 2013, Sherrie died.

'It was the most difficult time of my life,' she said.

Miss Barrett says she does not think that it is 'healthy to know' if she is likely to develop cancer in the future

'I would cry every day and felt scared and helpless.

'Not only would Darcy never know his granddad or grandmother, but now he would never know his aunty either.

'But I had to stay strong as I had a baby who depended on me.'

Miss Barrett said her family's bad luck has baffled doctors who have advised her to undergo genetic testing, but she has refused because she fears the results.

'I don't think it's healthy to know,' she explained.

'If they told me it was likely I was going to develop cancer in the future it would be hard to carry on on a daily basis.

'Of course, I think about it every day - more now than ever that I am a mother - but I can't curl up and die, I have to keep going for the sake of my son.

'Every day I cherish and live my life to the full.'
