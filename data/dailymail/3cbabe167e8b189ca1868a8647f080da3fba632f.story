A group of killjoy students have proven that Batman's heroic glides through Gotham city wouldn't allow miraculous escapes and flying kicks - instead, Batman would probably die.

To pull off the famous stunt, the Caped Crusader would need a much bigger cape, say a group of British physics students from Leicester - or he should invest in jets to slow his descent.

With his current, smaller cape, Batman would hit the ground at around 50mph, causing catastrophic injuries and probably death.

Dashing the dreams of comic fans across the world, four students from the University of Leicester said that while Batman could glide using his cape as he does in the 2005 film ‘Batman Begins’, his landing would almost certainly prove fatal.

The superhero is back in cinemas later this month in ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ and they suggested Batman should go shopping before trying a similar attempt to become airborne over Gotham City.

‘If Batman wanted to survive the flight, he would definitely need a bigger cape,’ said David Marshall, 22, one of the students in the final year of their four-year Master of Physics degree.

‘Or if he preferred to keep his style intact he could opt for using active propulsion, such as jets to keep himself aloft.’

In a paper titled ‘Trajectory of a falling Batman’, the group argued that if he jumped from a 492-foot high building, the 15-foot wingspan of Batman's cape would allow him to glide 1148 feet.

However, he would reach a speed of 68 miles per hour before hitting the ground at a life-threatening speed of 50 mph.
