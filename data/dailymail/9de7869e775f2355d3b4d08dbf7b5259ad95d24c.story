Amazon has revealed more details of its plan to take on TV broadcasters.

The firm is developing at least 11 programmes, including 5 childrens shows, and has signed up stars including John Goodman and Bill Murray for pilots.

It hopes to take on an increasing threat from Hulu,which already produces its own content, Netflix, which recently revealed House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey (its first original show), and YouTube, which is believed to be readying subscription channels.

Ther Big Lebowski: The Dude (Jeff Bridges) and Walter (John Goodman) in the cult film. Goodman is now filming a pilot series for Amazon, which will be available online

The shows will be available via Amazon's online streaming service, which in the UK is branded as LoveFilm.

It will be viewable on a range of devices, from desktop computers and iPads to internet connected TVs.

The pilot episodes will be available for free, with users voting on which gets a full commission.

Completed series will be 
exclusive to Amazon Prime customers in the United States and 
LoveFilm customers in the United Kingdom.

Amazon will launch the programmes on LoveFilm, its internet video business, and on similar platforms in the U.S and Germany.

Depending on the reaction, the company will decide which of its pilots - which have each cost $1million - to develop in full.

The Amazon shows include
Alpha House, starring John Goodman, the Hollywood actor known for his 
roles in The Big Lebowski and Argo.

Bill Murray, of Ghostbusters and 
Groundhog Day, also appears.

Roy Price, director of Amazon Studios, the unit that is creating the shows, said: ‘I think the distinction between a regular TV show and an online TV show will soon fade away.

‘It just makes sense that if you’re trying to decide what TV show to make, it might be a good idea to ask customers which one they like.’

Each pilot is available on Amazon Instant Video for free, with viewer feedback deciding which show will get a full series order from the company.

The completed series, however, will be exclusive to just Amazon Prime customers in the United States and LoveFilm customers in the United Kingdom.

Hulu has also produced and co-produced several shows, most recently working with the BBC on the latest series of In The Thick Of It.
