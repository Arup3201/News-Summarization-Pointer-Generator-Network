Lady in red: Former British number one Elena Baltacha showing her glamorous side

She never once gave up.

From the moment she arrived in a strange country at the age of five to the day she was diagnosed with an illness that would ultimately cut her life short, British tennis star Elena Baltacha fought all the way.

The Ukrainian-born but Scottish-raised former British women's number one died on Sunday aged 30, from liver cancer.

But a leaf through family photos tells
 how much she packed into those three decades – from the anxious-looking
 child we see here to the confident, glamorous star who went on to 
inspire countless youngsters to take up her chosen sport.

Tragically,
 she learned she had advanced cancer just two months after retiring from
 the sport and weeks after marrying her long-term boyfriend and coach, 
Nino Severino in December.

She
 had bravely vowed to fight her illness 'with everything I have' – 
echoing the gritty determination she displayed on court. But it was one 
battle she couldn't win. She died peacefully at her home in Ipswich 
surrounded by family and friends and with her husband at her side.

Miss
 Baltacha had been fighting illness for a lot longer than just the past 
few months. Aged just 19 she was diagnosed with primary sclerosing 
cholangitis, a rare chronic liver condition that affects the immune 
system.

Not that it stopped 
her from shining on the tennis court. Miss Baltacha, who was born in 
Kiev in 1983, was five when her professional footballer father Sergei's 
career brought him to the UK, playing for teams including Ipswich Town 
and St Johnstone.

She has described seeing little of her father because of his football and came to rely on her mother, Olga, an Olympic pentathlete, to get her to training and matches.

'It's tough when you travel because it's very lonely; all you see are the tennis courts and hotels and it's so nice to have someone there who really knows you,' said Miss Baltacha, whose brother Sergei also became a footballer.

It was in Perth that she started playing seriously and at 15 she became the youngest ever winner of the Scottish women's indoor championship.

She came to public attention when she reached the third round of Wimbledon in 2002.

Clearly exhausted when she was knocked out, this led to tests which showed she had PSC. Despite the setbacks, she spent 132 weeks as British number one between 2009 and 2012 and reached a world ranking of 49.

Describing her attitude on court, she once said: 'I'm in your face because it's a battle. It's lock horns and see who comes out toughest.

But as soon as I'm off the tennis court, I'm just the opposite – chilled, relaxed and not really fazed or bothered by anything.'

Her husband said in a statement yesterday: 'We are heartbroken beyond words at the loss of our beautiful, talented and determined Bally.

'She was an amazing person and she touched so many people with her inspirational spirit, her warmth and her kindness.'
