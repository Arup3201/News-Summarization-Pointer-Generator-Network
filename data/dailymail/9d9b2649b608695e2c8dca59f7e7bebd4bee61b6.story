A woman who called herself the 'Black Madam' will stand trial on murder charges for allegedly performing illegal buttocks-enhancing procedures on a London tourist who later died in her Philadelphia hotel.

A judge upheld third-degree murder charges during a preliminary hearing today against Padge Gordon, who is also known as Padge Windslowe, 40.

The ruling comes after a friend of the dancer testified today that she and 20-year-old Claudia Aderotimi came to Philadelphia last year and had their buttocks enlarged.

Windslowe's defense attorney argued that both girls knew his client was not a real doctor as they had visited her for the injections before.

Theresa Gyamfi said the 'Black Madam' 
gave them silicone injections in their hotel room — but then fled when 
Aderotimi went into respiratory distress.

A doctor testified that the industrial-grade, not medical grade, silicone went to Aderotimi's blood, liver, lungs and brain.

She was rushed to a Delaware County 
hospital in an ambulance, but died within hours of a pulmonary embolism,
according to the doctor.

But defense lawyer Christopher Mannix 
said he will challenge those medical conclusions at trial, along with 
allegations his client performed the injections.

The Philadelphia Inquirer said that 
prosecutors told the court she painted herself out to be a medical 
professional when she administered a series of injections to the two 
women.

This was  the second time the woman went to Windslowe, paying $1,800 to $2,300 a time to have their butts enlarged.

Windslowe's attorney, Christopher 
Mannix, argued the silicone that killed Aderotimi had not been linked 
conclusively to the silicone found at the injection site.

He also said 
the women knew Windslowe was not a medical professional, and that they 
were getting an illegal procedure.

The Black Madam has been jailed since
March when she was arrested on charges of administering a series of 
injections to an exotic dancer in Philadelphia.

That woman did not die but has since suffered from lingering health problems.

It is alleged that Windslowe left the hotel room even after Miss Aderotimi complained of chest pains and breathing problems.

Police charged Windslowe in July after a year-long investigation.

Miss Aderotimi's friends said she believed a 'bigger booty' would help her dream to appear in more music videos.

The aspiring dancer was dropped from one shoot because directors discovered she had been wearing padded trousers to help enlarge her bottom.

Windslowe has also been charged with 
injuring an exotic dancer who spent two weeks in the hospital after she 
was injected with silicone and Krazy Glue in a similar procedure

Talent scout Tee Ali, who met the 
Thames Valley University student when she filmed a video, told The Sun: 
'The problem was she didn't have no butt, and she wanted a butt.

'She went to audition for one video shoot wearing fake booty pants and she got all the attention.

'But when they found out it was fake she didn't get asked back.'

They have also charged Windslowe with 
injuring an exotic dancer who spent two weeks in the hospital after she 
was injected with silicone and Krazy Glue in a similar procedure.

Windslowe was arrested in February 2012 at what police called a 'pumping party' at a Philadelphia home.

That
arrest was for assault and related charges in a separate incident that 
authorities said left a client with severe lung problems from silicone 
that entered her bloodstream and was later found in her lungs.

Illegal
injections using substances including liquid silicone, paraffin and 
petroleum jelly have been used to enlarge women's breasts, hips and 
buttocks in other cases.

It was believed that Windslowe used silicon from Thailand mixed with Krazy Glue for the injections, charging $1,000 a time.

Authorities said they knew Windslowe had injected Aderotimi, but the Delaware County medical examiner's office was awaiting test results from the Food and Drug Administration before determining the cause of death.

Philadelphia police believe she has performed at least 14 cosmetic surgeries, moving locations to avoid detection.

The authorities said Windslowe would clean the site before injecting a substance she described as silicone into the client's buttocks.

When the procedure was done, she would cover the wound with glue.
