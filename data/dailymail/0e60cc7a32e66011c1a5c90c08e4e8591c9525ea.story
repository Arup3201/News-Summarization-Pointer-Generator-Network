Marked for death: Ronald Post, 53, claims there are no accessible veins in his arms, hands or legs because he is so obese

A condemned killer trying to delay his execution because of his extreme weight may need to come up with another excuse after a judge rejected his request on Monday.

Death row inmate Ronald Post, who weighs more than 400 pounds, is asking the courts to stop his January execution on the grounds his weight could cause him to suffer severe pain during the procedure.

Post is prohibited from challenging his execution by injection because he raised similar claims in his first set of federal appeals in 1997, Judge Lesley Wells said Monday in Cleveland.

In general, death row inmates are only allowed one federal appeal when alleging the same set of facts.

Post 'has not demonstrated in his new petition that his medical condition has changed so significantly, or that Ohio's new lethal injection procedures have changed so radically, since he filed his first petition in 1997 that his original core complaints are transformed into something new,' Wells wrote.

However, the judge sent the question to a federal appeals court in Cincinnati for a final determination according to federal law governing this type of appeal.

The state is opposing Post's requests to delay his execution.

Post, 53, was sentenced to die for the 1983 shooting death of hotel desk clerk Helen Vantz in Elyria. His execution is scheduled for January 16.

Fears: Post is worried executioners at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility will not be able to find a vein because of his weight

Vantz's son, Bill, has called Post's arguments 'laughable.'

Post also wants his execution delayed
to try to prove that claims he made a full confession to several people
have been falsely exaggerated.

Post's attorneys declined to comment Monday.

They have previously argued that Post's medical condition hasn't been stable. At issue, they say, is his condition around the time of his execution, not at the time of an original court challenge.

Post 'could not have raised this claim in his earlier petition because the execution was not imminent and his physical and medical condition have not been stable in relation to an execution date,' his attorneys wrote in earlier court filings.

Arguments: Richard Cooey, who weighed 267lbs at the time of his execution in 2008, argued his own case of being too big to die while holding prison food and limited opportunities to exercise responsible

Escaped death: In 1994 Mitchell Rupe, who weighed 400lbs while sentenced to death, had his sentence changed to life in prison after found too heavy to hang without risking decapitation

Post has also sued to stop his 
execution as part of a long-running challenge of Ohio's execution 
procedures in federal court in Columbus.

Judge Gregory Frost has scheduled a December 17 hearing.

The lethal injection, invented in 1977, is designed to kill a patient quickly and painlessly.

The cocktail of drugs used varies from state to state, but generally it contains a barbiturate that induces a deep sleep; a paralyzing agent that halts breathing; and potassium chloride, which stops the heart.

However, dosages vary by state, not by inmate; people are given the same dosage regardless of their size.

As a result the lethal injection is not necessarily quick or painless, a 2007 study published in PLoS Medicine found. If any of the doses in the injection are off the patient feels pain but also may suffer a slow death by asphyxiation, according to the study.

Molecular biologist Teresa Zimmers of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, told the Scientific American at the time: 'This idea that this is a painless procedure is completely wrong. It's just invisible because the person is paralyzed.'

Post has tried losing weight, but knee and back problems have made it difficult to exercise, his lawyers say.

They also say Post's request for 
gastric bypass surgery has been denied, he has been encouraged not to 
walk because he's at risk for falling, and severe depression has 
contributed to his inability to limit how much he eats.

A doctor who examined Post for his 
defense team says Post does not have accessible veins in his arms or 
hands because of his weight and could not receive a lethal injection in 
his legs because he is so obese.

Before his execution in 2008, 266-pound death row inmate Richard Cooey also claimed Ohio authorities would have trouble finding a vein in his flab.

In a lawsuit, Cooey argued that he would suffer a painful 
death by lethal injection because of his size.

However, his execution passed without any recorded incident.

In
1994 in Washington state, a federal judge upheld the conviction of 
Mitchell Rupe, but agreed with Rupe's contention that at more than 400 
pounds, he was too heavy to hang because of the risk of decapitation.

Rupe argued that hanging would constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

After numerous court rulings and a third trial, Rupe was eventually sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 2006.
