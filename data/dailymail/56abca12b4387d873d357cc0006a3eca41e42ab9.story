Menachem Stark.

No one has yet been caught in relation to the murder.

 said crime scene investigators are hoping to find forensic evidence in 
the vehicle, which appears to have been washed and cleaned.

Investigators
 quickly obtained a search warrant for the van, and have interviewed the
 owner, a man with connections to Brooklyn and Pennsylvania who is not 
being considered a suspect.

The van had not been stolen, a law enforcement source said.

Sources
 also said a cellphone found attached to the undercarriage of Stark's 
personal vehicle has been linked to same businessman who might be 
responsible for abducting Stark or hiring others to do so.

According
 to public records seen by the New York Post, Mr Stark and his business 
partner Israel Perlmutter owed more than $40 million to creditors.

Detectives are investigating whether his killing was a professional hit ordered by someone he owed money to.

Last
 week, newly released footage, showed one of the suspects in the walking
 from the van past Mr Stark's office, before returning to the vehicle 
where he remained for hours, sources told the New York Post.

'He was definitely casing the guy,' a 
source said of the suspect, who was wearing a light jacket and a cap pulled low over his head.

The footage is one of several security camera tapes viewed by New York police.

Sidewalk surveillance video recorded Stark’s dramatic, kidnapping outside his real estate offices in Williamsburg.

Instead, during a fierce struggle, detectives believe, his abductors sat on him, suffocating him to death.

His
 body had been set on fire and was still smoldering when it was pulled 
the next day from a gas station Dumpster in Great Neck, Long Island.
