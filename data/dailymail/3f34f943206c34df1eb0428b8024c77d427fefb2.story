It was a disappointing night for EastEnders at this year's British Soap Awards as the soap won only accolade, as their ITV rival Coronation Street picked up eight.

The Walford-based series's only appearance on the winners' tally was one Lifetime Achievement accolade for stalwart Adam Woodyatt, who plays Ian Beale.

Meanwhile, the Weatherfield show clinched eight of the 16 categories, including the coveted Best British Soap Award.

Alan Halsall and his on-screen wife Natalie Gumede were some of the big winners, taking home four awards between them for their domestic abuse storyline.

Natalie, who plays troubled Kirsty Soames, won Villain Of The Year, Best Dramatic Performance and Best Storyline, which she shared with Alan and co-star Jennie McAlpine.

Accepting Best Dramatic Performance, she said: 'I really feel 
this award belongs to everyone at Coronation Street. In the last year I 
have been picked up and put back together so many times and it's been 
the experience of my life.'Â

Alan was named Best Actor for his portrayal of Tyrone Dobbs, shortly after their had been a tribute to his late co-star Bill Tarmey, who played his character's surrogate father Jack Duckworth.

Alan said: 'Fancy bringing me up here after he's 
(Tarmey) been on the screen. I owe a lot to that man, he means a lot to 
me. And Liz Dawn as well, she means a lot to
 me.

'I firmly believe that you're only as good as the people around 
you and so thank you to everybody who works at Coronation Street and 
every cast member. I'd also like to thank my beautiful wife Lucy-Jo 
Hudson and also our special guest, our baby bump. Can't wait to meet ya.'

Hard-hitting: Natalie, Alan and Jennie McAlpine picked up Best Storyline

Meanwhile, their co-star Michelle Keegan won Sexiest Female for the fifth year running, beating off co-star Georgia May Foote, Emmerdale's Natalie Anderson, Hollyoaks' Jorgie Porter and EastEnders Jacqueline Jossa.

Michelle, who recently announced she is leaving the soap next year, said: 'Thank you so much. This is ridiculous. I'm going to get this out in 50 years and be the coolest gran ever!'

Ex-EastEnders actress Gillian Taylforth made a special appearance to present her former on-screen son Adam with his Lifetime Achievement Award.

As fans of the BBC soap will know, he is the longest serving castmember, having been in EastEnders since it began in 1985.

He said during his acceptance speech: 'I'm speechless. I should have guessed because normally you 
only get given one guest ticket - I got six! Normally you're not allowed
 to sit next to your partner, my wife's sat right next to me.

'The only other award I've ever won was for photography, and you know what I'm chuffed with that.'

Meanwhile, Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks were thrilled with their haul of five accolades, including Best Actress for Claire Cooper and Sexiest Male for Danny Mac.
