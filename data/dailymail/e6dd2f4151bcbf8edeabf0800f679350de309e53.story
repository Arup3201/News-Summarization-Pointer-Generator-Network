The 30-year-old mother who tricked her entire community into believing her 5-year-old daughter had cancer has been spared jail today by an Iowa judge.

Leatha Slauson, who cashed in more than $1,000 in donations for her child in August, has instead been ordered to spend five-years on probation in lieu of a sentence of two five-year jail terms. Slauson had faced up to 21 years in prison.

District Court Judge Kathleen Kilnoski also ordered a tearful Slauson that she have no contact with her five children after she shaved her daughter Riley's head, medicated her with cannabis oil to bring on lethargy and even convinced her husband his child was dying.

However, before she was let free on probation, the Atlantic mother pleaded to be allowed to see her children.

Tears: Leatha Slauson pleaded with the judge in Iowa not to take her away from her children - but he declined and called her actions 'repugnent'

Punishment: Leatha Slauson is allowed to walk free today in Atlantic, Iowa, but will not see her children for another five years

'I'm so sorry it got this far. I never meant to hurt anyone,' said Slauson on the stand. 

'I can most likely lose custody of my five beautiful babies. That is the worst punishment of all,' said Slauson to the court according to WOWT.Com.

The judge made it clear if the disgraced mother violates any terms of probation, including seeing her children she would be thrown in jail for five years.

Slauson can only see her children if they request it by their therapist, and then only if the visit is supervised by a psychologist.

A psychiatrist told the court on Tuesday that he had diagnosed Slauson to be mentally ill, but said he couldn't determine exactly what. 

The judge told Slauson, 'The nature of these offense are huge. Any time a person commits a crime against a child it is abhorrent. But when the person committing that crime is also the person's parent it is even more repugnant.'

Leatha Kaye Slauson of Atlantic, Iowa was arrested in August after local authorities discovered her 5-year-old daughter Riley wasn't actually dying of colorectal cancer.

In November, Slauson pleaded guilty to two counts of child endangerment, one of administering harmful substances, one of theft and one of unlawful possession of a prescription drug.

The 30-year-old mother-of-five started spreading the lie back in September 2013, shaving little Riley's head and even medicating her with unnecessary cannabis oil.

The local community rallied around the Riley, raising money and even paying for the family's trip to Walt Disney World.

Drugs: Slauson has also been charged for medicating Riley with unnecessary cannabis oil. She posted this picture of the little girl sucking on an oral syringe to Facebook. Oral syringes are commonly used to dispense cannabis oil

The ruse was brought to light last week when administrators at Riley's school started looking into what special care she might need and realized inconsistencies with the mother's story.

Slauson first started the story in fall 2013, and even went on television in the spring to talk about her daughter's so-called bucket list.

Firefighter-obsessed Riley was brought into the local station to ride around in a fire truck for a day, and her mother talked to local reporters about her daughter's 'illness'.

'(The cancer) is just spreading too fast,' Slauson told KETV back in April. 'It spread to her liver and the last MRI (showed) it spread to her lymph nodes and they stopped chemotherapy.'

It also appears Slauson medicated Riley with unnecessary cannabis oil, and even posted a picture of the girl on her Facebook, sucking at an oral syringe commonly used to dispense the drug.

The little girl subsequently tested positive for THC.

Local authorities held a press conference after Slauson's arrest and said it appears she was the only person involved in the crime, saying her husband and four other children were convinced of the ruse as well.

They wouldn't say the total funds Slauson conned from the community, but it's thought to be over $1,000.

Following Slauson's arrest, Riley and her four other children are being cared for by their father. Cass County Attorney Dan Gesitner says the father is 'struggling with how to proceed in his life'.
