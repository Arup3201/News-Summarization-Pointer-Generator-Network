Liverpool are set to open contract talks with Steven Gerrard later this week.

The 34-year-old has eight months left on his current deal and would be free to sign a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs from January 1.

However, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is anxious to keep Gerrard at Anfield and has recommended to Fenway Sports Group that his contract be renewed.

Rodgers held initial discussions with Gerrard’s representatives last month to explain his role and now it will be a case of agreeing terms.

Gerrard, who is close to making 700 appearances for Liverpool, revealed in an interview with Sportsmail last month that he has no plans to retire at the end of the campaign. 

The international break will allow Liverpool the chance to refocus after a dismal period in which they have fallen 15 points behind league leaders Chelsea. 

They return to action at Crystal Palace on Sunday week and Daniel Sturridge should be back.
