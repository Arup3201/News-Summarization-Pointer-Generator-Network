A warehouse worker who stole a £760 bottle of designer perfume bound for duty free shoppers at Heathrow is facing jail today.

Hasmik Blaszyck, 35, helped herself to the high-end scent while working at World Duty Free’s warehouse in Runnymede last summer.

But she picked the wrong bottle – a limited edition Swarovski perfume that was one of just 500 produced, and was easily traced back to her.

The unique number on the empty perfume box that she had left behind matched that stamped on a crystal bottle found in a wardrobe at her home.

She had tried to claim that a workmate had stolen the perfume and that she only received it after it had been taken.

But a jury at the Old Bailey found her guilty of theft today.

She will be sentenced next month.

Judge Stephen Kramer QC, warned Blaszcyk that she could face a jail for the theft.

He said: 'I make it clear that, the jury having found you guilty of theft, this is a very serious offence and all sentencing options will be open on September 10 to me.'

The court heard that Blaszcyk stole the perfume, Swarovski Aura Prestige Edition,  between May 17 and July 2 last year having started work at World Duty Free's warehouse two years previously.

Each bottle of the Swarovski Aura Prestige Edition is adorned with 11 crystals and only 500 bottles of the fragrance were made.

The bottle, which has a lace veil design enhanced by flowers, is presented in a luxurious leather case.

According to Swarovski, the bottle has 'pure, futuristic lines' and 'is designed like a long sheath of gleaming metal that envelops the glass'.

The perfume's notes say that it is a blend of fragrances including lychee, green tea, peony, lotus and white musk.

Prosecutor Ben Irwin said that a stock check at the firm's Perfume Gallery store in Terminal 3 at Heathrow had uncovered the missing fragrance.

He said: 'What should have been in place was three bottles of perfume because three had been ordered from the distribution centre.

'One of the three had been sold. The other two were still believed to be in the perfume store.

'When they were checked the boxes were there as you would expect, but one had been opened and the bottle of perfume was missing.

'It had been taken from the box and the box left behind. In fact it was very distinctive because this was a limited edition perfume.

'That bottle - number 255 - was then found at Ms Blaszcyk's home address, in a wardrobe.'

She gave no comment when she was interviewed by police.

Blaszyck was bailed ahead of the sentencing hearing on the condition she lives at her home address.

She had denied theft and an alternative charge of handling stolen goods.
