Come January there are many who begin the upward struggle to rid themselves of the extra pounds gained through holiday indulgence.

These pictures show that it is not just humans who may have had a mince meant pie too many this Christmas – one or two of these pets definitely need a diet.

The odd treat is definitely well-earned for catching a ball or a piece of string, but these animals are definitely being killed with kindness as most appear barely able to move.

Right motivation: This heifer digs into his owners leftovers face first after somehow getting up on a chair to reach the table

Christmas indulgence: Finally, after the fourth helping, Fido had enough turkey

Not the gym type: 'Exercise? Sure, why not - I hear you bought new silk sheets'

Unfortunately these pets are not the only ones in trouble.

In the United States it is estimated that 54 per cent of all dogs and cats are overweight or obese.

A report from 2011 showed that 12 million UK pets are overweight after being fed too many calorific treats, including takeaways, cheese, crisps and cakes, often on a daily basis.

The study, by the veterinary charity PDSA, also showed that owners were unaware of the damage they were doing.

Bring on the nuts: Meet Chip and Dale's cousin, Chips'N'Dates

Waiter, bring me some pie: Quite how this fat ginger tom intended to get back on his feet when the sun disappears is unclear

Safety first: 'Sorry owner, there appears to be a seatbelt issue of the reach-around kind. We'll have to do the vet another day'

Most believed the ‘special treats’ were something which enriched their pets’ lives.

Only two per cent felt any remorse over feeding their pets high-calorie snacks and nibbles.

Over six million British dogs and five million cats are fed junkfood on regular basis and a nearly all owners - 90 per cent - admitted giving cheese, toast, crisps, biscuits, takeaways, cakes or other fatty treats as part of their diet.

Heavy-weight lifting: 'Did you get hefty over Christmas, owner? Not to worry, you can use me to exercise'

Rolypolypet: 'The transformation into my Halloween costume has already begun, I'm going as an orange'

Talk about wobbles: This poor spaniel is literally too full to walk

Staying put: 'How lazy are you, just walk around me! Bah, humans'

Purrfect size: You know your pet has had too much to eat when it literally rolls over its own sides
