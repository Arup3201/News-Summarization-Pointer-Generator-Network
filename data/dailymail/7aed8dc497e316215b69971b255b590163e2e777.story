The former home of hell-raising poet Dylan Thomas has gone up for sale for £450,000.

The Welsh writer's clifftop home at New Quay, overlooking Cardigan Bay, was once stormed by a spurned husband who accused Thomas of sleeping with his wife and fired his machine gun through the window.

William Killick, who had just come home from the Second World War, also let off a grenade at the poet's bungalow in the 1945 attack which was later featured in the 2008 Hollywood film The Edge Of Love.

Majoda, the clifftop bungalow where Dylan Thomas lived with wife Caitlin in 1944 is now for sale for £450,000

Dylan Thomas and his wife Caitlin moved into the modest bungalow at New Quay in September 1944

The legendary writer moved into the house, which he called the 'shack at the end of a cliff', in September 1944 with his wife Caitlin MacNamara.

While at the house, called Majoda, he was inspired to write the radio piece Quite Early One Morning, a sketch for his later piece Under Milk Wood.  He also wrote several poems, including Fern Hill, which he began at Majoda and completed the following summer while living in Blaen Cwm.

But it was a bitter fight by a husband who believed Thomas had cuckolded him that earned the house a place in cinematic history.

One night in March 1945, when the pubs had closed and Thomas was drinking with some friends at his clifftop home, recently-returned Army captain William Killick marched up to the window and fired a Sten gun through it.

Having recently returned from the war in Greece, Killick believed Thomas to have been having an affair with his wife - and Thomas' childhood friend - Vera Phillips.

In his jealous rage, Killick then marched into the bungalow and fired off another round before threatening to let off a hand grenade.

The producers recreated the house as it was when Thomas lived in it down to the last detail for the 2008 film

No-one was hurt in the attack, but 
Killick was later charged with attempted murder, and the story was told 
in The Edge Of Love starring Matthew Rhys as Thomas, Sienna Miller as 
Caitlin, and Keira Knightley as Vera.

Now
this modest piece of Welsh literary history is for sale with a few more
modern comforts than the poet would have known, including double 
glazing to keep out the bitter winds sweeping in off the sea.

Estate
agent Fred Davies, who is selling Majoda, said: 'It is a beautiful 
property with unrivalled, breathtaking views, wonderful grounds and its 
own access to the beach.'

Local writer and Dylan Thomas expert Roger Bryan said: 'There were certainly shots fired at the property.

'The story goes that Killick seized a machine gun and a hand grenade, and fired a number of shots at Majoda.

'Fortunately no-one was injured, but Dylan was clearly shaken up.'

Shortly after the incident Dylan moved out of the house - where he had paid just £1 a week in a rent but managed without running water and electricity.

New Quay is believed to be the inspiration for the fictitious Llareggub in his play for voices, Under Milk Wood.

The house has since been rebuilt and the 2008 film was shot at a full-size mock-up in the field next-door to it.

The story of the cottage has gone down as part of the legend surrounding the poet who died in 1953 aged just 39.

But the truth of the affair remains under dispute with some claiming the details were embellished for Hollywood.

At the time Dylan’s wife Caitlin wrote: 'Frank was convinced that his wife had been living with us in a menage a trois (which was a ridiculous thought) while he had been away.

'And that we had been drinking too much of his money (there may have been some truth in that).'
