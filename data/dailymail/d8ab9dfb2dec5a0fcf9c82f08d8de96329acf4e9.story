Confessions: Brigham City mayor Dennis Fife

A married small-town mayor and former Mormon bishop in Utah has been forced to admit he had an affair in an extraordinary open letter.

Brigham City mayor Dennis Fife confessed to having an illicit relationship with a woman he once counseled during his time as a bishop with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Fife said in a short letter released on Monday that the relationship began after he was released from his bishop duties.

He asks for forgiveness and says he's seeking repentance.

He told the city council about his 
affair during a closed meeting last week and sent out the statement to 
address rumors swirling in the community.

Some council members reportedly wanted the mayor to resign, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

Councilwoman Ruth Jensen told the newspaper: 'Even with this confession, people might forgive, but they won’t forget.

'As a leader of our town, I don’t see how he can get over it.'

The woman's identity has not been released. Mr Fife said that the affair ended several months ago.

Fife was elected Mayor of Brigham, 60 miles north of Salt Lake City, in November 2009. He ends his term in office in December 2013.

The air force veteran and former chemistry professor has been married to his wife Metta for 40 years and has six children and 18 grandchildren.

As part of a personal statement on the mayor's website, Mr Fife writes: 'I believe in an open door policy and in keeping the residents of Brigham City informed.

'There are many challenges that are before us and I hope that the citizens will be involved.'

Brigham City is located in Box Elder County, Utah and has a population of around 18,000. It was founded by Mormon pioneer William Davis in 1850.

Small town gossip: Brigham City mayor Dennis Fife told the city council about his affair last week after rumors ran rife

 On November 30, 2012, Mayor Dennis Fife sent this message to constituents:

For over seven months now, I have been going through the repentance process for indiscretions I have committed.

I have confessed to my wife, my ecclesiastical leaders and recently spoke to the city council but I want to share that confession with the residents of Brigham City.Prior to serving as your mayor, I served as a local Bishop.

In that capacity I counseled with many members of the congregation regarding their personal lives. When I was released, one woman with whom I had been counseling continued to seek my advice. I referred her to the new Bishop and yet she continued to seek me out.

I am not assigning blame to her, but the confidential relationship that had developed during my counseling time with her as a Bishop continued.

I am guilty of indiscretions that occurred during this continuation period.I recognized the need to completely terminate that relationship and I have confided the details of my transgressions to my family and my church leaders.

They are assisting me in the repentance process. I have asked their forgiveness and understanding and I’m grateful it has been extended.We are working through these issues together.As your mayor, I am asking for your forgiveness and understanding.

I have the support of my wife and I am asking for your support as I continue to serve as your mayor. Judge me as you will but my conscience is clear and my commitment to serve is resolute.
