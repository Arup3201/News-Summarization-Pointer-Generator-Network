Texas Governor Rick Perry signed tough new abortion law restrictions today, including a ban after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and rules that could shutter most of the clinics in the state.

More than 100 Republican lawmakers attended the signing ceremony in Austin, Texas, with a small band of protesters outside dressed in black and holding a sign that read, 'Shame.'

The legislation, which is one of the biggest victories in a decade for opponents of abortion, had sparked weeks of protests at the state Capitol.

Perry signed the measure flanked by invited political supporters and anti-abortion activists, who gave him a standing ovation as he entered the room.

'It is a very happy and celebratory day,' said Perry, who thanked anti-abortion activists for helping to 'support the health of Texas women'.

The new law bans abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy and dictates when abortion-inducing drugs can be taken.

The law will prohibit anyone other than a doctor dispensing the so-called 'abortion pill,' or RU-486 drug, to end pregnancies, and require that a second dosage be administered at a clinic under a doctor's supervision and not at home.

Should abortions be banned after 20 weeks of pregnancy?

It also requires abortion clinic doctors to have hospital admitting privileges and restricts abortions to surgical centers.

Only five of Texas' 42 abortion clinics currently meet the new requirements.

The law will take effect in October and clinics will have a year to upgrade their facilities or shutdown.

Perry said the new law 'builds upon our commitment to protecting life in the state of Texas.'

Texas Republicans, who have a large majority in the state legislature, pushed through the restrictions over the fierce objection of Democrats and supporters of the right to abortion.

Democratic state Senator Wendy Davis briefly caught national attention last month by staging a filibuster to stall the restrictions, although her gambit ultimately failed.

While several other conservative states have approved piecemeal abortion restrictions, Texas is by far the most populous and politically important, and it took more dramatic action by combining several measures into one bill.

The Texas measures are also more far reaching than a ban passed by the U.S. Congress in 2003 on a type of late-term abortion called 'partial birth', which covered only a small fraction of abortions performed each year.

Texas joins 12 other states which have passed bans on abortion after 20 weeks, citing disputed research that a fetus feels pain by that stage. North Dakota and Arkansas have gone further, banning abortion as early as six and 12 weeks respectively.

The current limit for abortions in Texas is 26 weeks.

Texas already has a law passed two years ago requiring a woman to undergo an ultrasound and be shown the results, before an abortion can be performed.

Opponents of the new Texas law say it will be found unconstitutional because the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision in 1973 allowed abortion up to the point a fetus is viable, or can live outside the womb.

The governor and other top Republican politicians in the state made passing the law a top priority, in part to please supporters before the primary election in March.

They failed to pass the bill last month on the last day of a special legislative session because of a Democratic state senator's lengthy filibuster and a raucous crowd.

But they were successful last week after Perry called a second special session to get the bill approved.

Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said today that the 'radical left' had inflicted 'intentional chaos' that delayed the bill's initial passage.

He credited prayer and even 'the hand of God' in making Thursday's event happen, as about 25 protesters could be heard chanting 'Shame! Shame! Shame!' out in the hallway.

Supporters of the law argue that it will ensure high-quality health care for women and fetuses, but opponents view it as over-regulation intended to make abortions harder to obtain.

Federal judges have blocked enforcement of similar measures in other states, questioning their constitutionality.

Opponents are expected to file similar suits in Texas now that Perry has signed the law.

The abortion rights activists vowed to immediately challenge the Texas law in court.

'The fight over this law will move to the courts,' Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement after the signing. 'People are enraged by this law.'

Some challenges of other state laws have been successful. A federal judge on Wednesday extended for two more weeks a hold on a Wisconsin provision requiring doctors performing an abortion have admitting privileges at a hospital, while the judge studies whether to block the law.

The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled recently on an abortion case. In 2006 it narrowly endorsed, 5 to 4, the U.S. Congressional ban on 'partial birth' abortions.
