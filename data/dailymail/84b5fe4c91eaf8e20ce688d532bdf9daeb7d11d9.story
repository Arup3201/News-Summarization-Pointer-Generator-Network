A British businessman is to be thrown out of China over a multimillion-pound bribery scandal, exposed after he was secretly filmed having sex with his lover.

Mark Reilly, 52, ran British drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline’s Chinese operation, enjoying a lifestyle that included a £1.2million house back in the Home Counties.

But he was handed a three-year suspended prison sentence – and the company landed with a £297million fine – after he admitted bribery charges.

The Chinese court fined GSK 3 billion yuan (£300 million) for bribing doctors and hospitals to use its products, drawing to a close the high-profile corruption probe

The covertly filmed footage of the married executive was emailed anonymously last year to board members of the firm.

Suspecting a disgruntled former employee of a blackmail attempt, he hired a private detective to investigate. But Chinese authorities turned the tables and accused him of running a huge bribery network.

GSK was alleged to have bribed Chinese doctors and other health officials with £320million worth of gifts, including sexual favours from prostitutes, to persuade them to prescribe its drugs. Yesterday it was revealed the firm had been fined £297million while Reilly was given a suspended jail term and a deportation order.

The scandal was unearthed when Reilly – who had worked at GSK for 25 years – was revealed to have been cheating on his 49-year-old wife Jill, with whom he has two daughters.

An anonymous email sent to board members in January last year contained the damning sex tape which had been secretly filmed at his flat in Shanghai. He was given permission to hire a British private investigator, Peter Humphrey, who launched a £20,000 probe focusing on disgruntled ex-employee Vivian Shi, 49, whose family is part of the city’s communist elite.

A few months later, Mr Humphrey was arrested with wife Yu Yingzeng, a US citizen and daughter of one of China’s eminent atomic weapons scientists. At about the same time, Chinese authorities began investigating the alleged bribery network.

Reilly was charged earlier this year with pressing his sales teams to bribe health officials, in a bid to meet targets.

Chinese news agencies revealed yesterday that a court in Hunan province had sentenced Reilly after he pleaded guilty to charges relating to bribery of doctors and hospitals.

GSK chief Sir Andrew Witty said the matter was ‘deeply disappointing’, adding: ‘We have and will continue to learn from this.’

The firm said it ‘fully accepts’ the facts of the investigation and the verdict and ‘sincerely apologises’ to patients and doctors.
