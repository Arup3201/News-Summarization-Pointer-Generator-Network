A harpist has spent nearly a decade playing to gorillas at her local zoo to cheer them up.

Terri Tacheny enjoyed taking her young daughters to Como Zoo in St. Paul, Minnesota, except for the Primate House, where she thought the gorillas, orangutans and monkeys seemed a little lethargic.

So she decided to brighten their moods by playing her harp to them.

Now Tacheny, 57, a zoo volunteer, sets up her harp once a month for an appreciative audience that ambles down to the barrier as soon as she begins playing her carved wooden harp.

'I don't speak gorilla, but there's a gorilla purr that occurs when I begin to play. And that's their happy sound,' Tacheny said.

As the shimmering sounds of Tacheny's harp drift through the leafy zoo, a male gorilla stares through the fence at the musician, then chews contentedly on vegetation.

Families stop to snap pictures. 

A therapeutic harpist, Tacheny plays for hospital patients to help them deal with pain and anxiety. 

She thought if the soothing sounds helped calm humans, it would work for the primates too.

'I would love to see every zoo have a harpist. I think it benefits the animals,' said Tacheny, a quick-to-smile woman.

Tami Murphy, a zookeeper at Como, said Tacheny has played for all the animals at the zoo. Some animals appear ambivalent, Murphy said, but the harp music 'seems to be a really calming thing for the apes to listen to.'

Tacheny says she's never gotten a negative review from her ape audience.

'I've never had anything thrown at me,' she said. 

Chimpanzees like to listen to music - but have very specific tastes, researchers revealed earlier this year.

While preferring silence to music from the West, chimpanzees like to listen to the different rhythms of music from Africa and India, researchers found.

The research is the first to discover primates have a preference for music, according to the American Psychological Association, which published the study.

The researchers admit they made the discovery by mistake, said study coauthor Frans de Waal, PhD, of Emory University.

'Our objective was not to find a preference for different cultures' music,' she said. 

'We used cultural music from Africa, India and Japan to pinpoint specific acoustic properties.

'Past research has focused only on Western music and has not addressed the very different acoustic features of non-Western music.

While nonhuman primates have previously indicated a preference among music choices, they have consistently chosen silence over the types of music previously tested.

Previous research has found that some nonhuman primates prefer slower tempos, but the current findings may be the first to show that they display a preference for particular rhythmic patterns, according to the study.

'Although Western music, such as pop, blues and classical, sound different to the casual listener, they all follow the same musical and acoustic patterns.

'Therefore, by testing only different Western music, previous research has essentially replicated itself,' the authors wrote.

The study was published in APA's Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition.
