This teenager is lucky to be alive after he was impaled on a tree branch.

Had the branch pierced his stomach just one millimetre the other way, he would have bled to death or be paralysed, doctors said.

Declan Clark, 13, slipped while climbing a tree and a branch pierced his bowel in a neighbour’s garden in Rosyth, Dunfermline, Scotland.

Lucky to be alive: Declan Clark, 13, made a lucky escape after this tree branch impaled his stomach and burst his bowel when he slipped while climbing the tree

Bleeding profusely, he was rushed to hospital for a three and a half hour operation which saved his life. He is now fitted with an external stoma bag while his bowel recovers.

His father John, 44, said: ‘It wasn’t until afterwards that the surgeon explained if the tree had been one millimetre to the left he would have bled to death.

‘If it had went a millimetre the other way he would have been in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

‘It was a very lucky escape. Hopefully 
the bowel will repair itself and at the end he will only have a big scar
 from his naval up to his chest.’

Miraculously, the branch shot straight back out of Declan’s stomach so none of it was still in his body as he was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy on July 20.

Mr Clark, a joiner, said Declan had been playing with other children and jumped off a railing onto the fir tree.

He said: ‘It was a million-in-one chance as he must have been at the right angle to go straight down and crush the top of the tree.

‘We reckon if it had been my younger son he wouldn’t be here, as when Declan landed his legs were just at the right height to touch the ground.

‘He fell forward and the tree sprang back out, it burst his bowel but they never found any part of the tree in his body.

‘They took him to Kirkcaldy to get prepped for going to Edinburgh but they had to operate immediately.’

He spent seven days in hospital after the operation and now must use the stoma bag for six months while his bowel heals.

Mr Clark said: ‘I can’t praise my son enough, he’s hardly shed a tear.

‘I can’t thank the people at Victoria Hospital enough as well, they were just amazing.’

The offending tree has been cut down.
