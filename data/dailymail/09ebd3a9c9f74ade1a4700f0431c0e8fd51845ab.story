The chilling 911 call of a Florida man who shot to death his daughter and six grandchildren before turning the gun on himself was today released by officials.

With an edgy yet calm voice, Don Spirit told the dispatcher: 'I just shot my daughter and shot all my grandkids. And I'll be sitting on my step so that when you get here I'm going to shoot myself.'

Just minutes earlier, the 51-year-old had gunned down his daughter Sarah Spirit, 28, and her children: Kaleb Kuhlmann, 11; Kylie Kuhlmann, 9; Johnathon Kuhlmann, 8; Destiny Stewart, 5; Brandon Stewart, 4; and Alanna Stewart, who was born in June.

The phone call, released this morning by the Gilchrist county Sheriff's Office, was placed by Spirit from his mobile home in the rural town of Bell on Thursday.

During the conversation, the female dispatcher asked the convicted felon what type of gun he had in his possession.

In response, Spirit angrily replied: 'It doesn't matter what kind of gun I've got. They're all dead. And then when you get here, I'll shoot myself. And then you figure out what kind of gun it is.'

He went on to say: 'I'm done with every f***ing thing.... We've got all the kids are dead in the house... Six kids, one adult... One of them was a baby.'

Killed: Just minutes before the phone call, Spirit had gunned down his daughter Sarah Spirit (pictured), 28

Victims: He also shot Miss Spirit's children, including four-year-old Brandon Stewart (pictured), on Thursday

The dispatcher then asked Spirit to stay on the phone until police arrived at the trailer home.

He replied: 'No, I'm not that - I'm waiting for them to get here. When they get here, I'm gonna shoot myself on my back step. All I'm doing is waiting for them.'

At the end of the transcript, the dispatcher could be heard whispering to her colleague: 'I need help'.

When deputies arrived at the scene on Thursday, they had a brief verbal exchange with Spirit before he shot himself, according to the Gilchrist County Sheriff's Office.

Inside the mobile home, the bodies of the six children were scattered. The bodies of Spirit and his daughter were found in different areas outside the trailer.

The sheriff's office and Florida Department of Law Enforcement said they released the 911 recording because they are in the final stages of the investigation.

Spirit used a .45-caliber handgun, and the FDLE and the sheriff's office have said they are looking into how he obtained a gun. As a felon, he was barred from owning firearms.

The killings have shattered the town of about 500 people about 43 miles west of Gainesville.

On Sunday, mourners including grief-stricken relatives gathered at Bell Elementary and Bell High School to hold candelight vigils for the victims of the shooting.

The Spirit family had numerous run-ins with the law. Donald Spirit served time after accidentally shooting to death his young son on a hunting trip.

Two weeks before the killings, someone called a state child abuse hotline to report that adults were doing drugs in front of the kids, according to documents released by Florida's Department of Children and Families.

A police report from 2008 also showed that Sarah Spirit had reported been beaten by her father when she was 36 weeks pregnant.
