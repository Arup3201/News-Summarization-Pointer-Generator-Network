The estranged wife of the driver who was at the wheel of a limo that burst into flames killing five female passengers claims he was arguing with her over the phone just before the disaster.

Rachel 'Raquel' Hernandez-Brown has said Orville 'Ricky' Brown, 46, was distracted, and even turned up the music in the limo so the bachelorette party in the back couldn't hear him fighting with his ex.

Bride-to-be Neriza Fojas, 31, and four of her friends died after becoming trapped in the blazing limousine on the San Mateo Bridge in San Francisco in May - a further four bachelorettes and driver Mr Brown managed to escape.

Ms Hernandez-Brown said the music in the limo was 'really loud', adding that she told her estranged husband 'You're not paying attention', and 'stop calling me'.

In an interview at her San Jose home she also recalled telling him: 'I'd hate to have a limo driver like you.'

Mr Brown was calling to try and make up after a violent outburst that was investigated by police earlier in the day she said, according to a report on Mercurynews.com.

Her remarks have raised questions over whether the driver was too distracted to react quickly when one of the women banged on the partition to get his attention after realising the vehicle was filling with smoke.

'We need to follow up on this,' Karen Guidotti, chief deputy San Mateo County district attorney, said on Friday when confronted with the content of the interview. Police had never contacted Ms Hernandez-Brown.

Mr Brown said he was not 'authorised' to talk to journalists or give interviews on Thursday, and declined to comment on his wife's account of the moments leading up to the fire on Saturday.

In the days after the fatal fire on May 4, Mr Brown recounted the ordeal in numerous television interviews.

He has insisted he did everything he could to get the women out of the car but that the flames were too intense.

He said someone from another car finally wrenched open one of the Lincoln Town Car's back doors.

Moments later he called his ex once again to tell her what was happening.

'My mom, I, everyone in my family were like, gosh, what made him not call the cops right away?' Ms Hernandez-Brown said in her interview.

One survivor said in the wake of the blaze that the driver did nothing to help the trapped women escape. She declined to comment on his wife's claims.

She and three other women escaped after climbing through the partition separating the driver's section from the passengers, but five others died in the limo.

The investigation into what caused the blaze is yet to conclude.

Mr Brown, 46, was born into a well-known Bay Area family. Lewis Brown Sr., his father, was the first African-American elected to the Vallejo City Council. He is also related to Charles Bledsoe, one of the attorneys who worked on the landmark 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education school-segregation case.

Orville Brown had worked for the limo company for about two months after a long period without a steady job, Ms Hernandez-Brown said.

She said he told her that the fire could be a windfall for them, saying, 'We're going to get super-paid'. But Hernandez-Brown insisted she didn't want anything to do with 'blood money'.

The report said Mr Brown used his phone to film the smouldering remains of the limo and text the footage to his wife with the words: '...Remember this could off [SIC] put me in the ground...'.
