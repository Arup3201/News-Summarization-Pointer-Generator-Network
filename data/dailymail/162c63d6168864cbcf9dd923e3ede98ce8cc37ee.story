The dramatic moment two state troopers saved the life of a disabled 13-year-old who was choking on a chicken nugget has been captured on dash cam video.

New Jersey troopers Ruben Benavidez and James Hearne were driving through Trenton on Sunday afternoon when they came across the frantic Estrada family on the roadside struggling to help their son, Julian, breathe after he started choking.

The family waved down the troopers and the two men are seen in the tape pulling up behind their car on Route 129 and then successfully dislodging the nugget, saving the 13-year-old's life.

Heroes: The dramatic moment two state troopers saved the life of a disabled teen who was choking on a chicken nugget has been captured on dash cam video

Julian's mother, Maricruz Estrada, said she first noticed her son, who was born with hydrocephalus or 'water on the brain', gasping for air while they were driving on the highway.

'Right away I look at him and I see that he was choking, so my husband pulled over right away,' she told CBS News.

The parents tried to clear the teen's throat but weren't having much success.

That's when the troopers came to the rescue.

Emergency: The Estrada family, pictured, waved down the troopers on Route 129 on Sunday afternoon and the troopers are seen in the tape pulling up behind the family's car

Teamwork: Trooper Hearne, center, performed the Heimlich manouver on Julian to dislodge the nugget while Trooper Benavidez, left controlled traffic, spoke with dispatch and helped calm down the Estradas in Spanish

'When I ran up there, I get behind him, started the Heimlich,' Trooper Hearne said of the lifesaving maneuver.

Meanwhile, Trooper Benavidez, who had only been on the job two weeks, controlled traffic, spoke with dispatch and helped calm down the Estradas in Spanish.

'She was just yelling and screaming in Spanish like any mom would, and try ripping a mom off her young son that's chocking, that's not easy to do,' Trooper Benavidez told the network.

Angels: The Estradas have labeled troopers Ruben Benavidez, left, and James Hearne, right, their guardian angels, believing that their son would have choked to death if they hadn't arrived when they did

Appreciative: Julian, left, who has was born with hydrocephalus, and his mother thanked the troopers for what they did

Because of his disability, Julian can't stand, forcing Trooper Hearne to hold him up off the ground while performing the Heimlich.

'The feel of it was completely different and Julian's situation is unique, but when it comes down to it, it's the same technique,' Trooper Hearne said.

The Estradas have labeled the troopers their guardian angels, believing that their son would have choked to death if they hadn't arrived when they did.

'When the troopers come we feel that we see angels coming,' Maricruz Estrada said.
