A New York district attorney has admitted to a past career as a porn star in the 1970s after denying his involvement in the final days of his second campaign – dropping a bombshell not only to voters but his shocked family as well.

Mark Suben, DA since 2008 in Cortland County near Syracuse who’s now also known for his roles in X-rated films like Deep Throat Part II, The Love Witch, Lecher and Bedroom Bedlam, according to IMDB, admitted his past in a news conference on Friday.

'Recently materials have been circulated alleging that I was involved in the adult film industry about 40 years ago in New York. Those allegations are true,' he said facing the press.

'I was an actor in adult films for a short period in the early 70s. I was also an actor in other venues including off Broadway, soap operas and commercial advertisements.'

He apologized for his actions and said he used 'bad judgment' by acting in porn and by lying about it.

Remaining tight lipped, he wouldn't take questions, including whether he should resign. On his way out of the news conference, several people said: 'You lied to me, Mark.'

Mr Suben's spokeswoman, Aimee Milks, said he will not resign.

'This was nearly 40 years ago. It was not illegal. Mark Suben was not yet married. He was not practicing law and he was not a law student,' said Ms Milks. 'It has nothing to do with his law practice or his current position as the district attorney of Cortland County.'

Pseudonym: A YouTube video compilation of his past work linked the DA to the scandalous roles when he called himself Gus Thomas, here seen in film The Devils Due

'I think the situation is really irrelevant to the campaign,' she said. 'His record as the DA for the last four years speaks for itself.'

Some others may disagree though including one who posted a video compilation of his work to YouTube one day before his admittance.

The videos including him in roles of seducing a girl scout in his apartment, performing a sacramental ritual on a naked woman, and whipping another woman during what appears to be intercourse.

Acting under the pseudonym Gus Thomas, the IMDB online database links Mr Suben an alternative name.

Mark Suben also appears in the credits for the non-pornographic 1976 movie 'Angels.'

'A few weeks ago, when asked, I denied this to members of the press,' Mr Suben said. 'I regret that and I apologize for it. I was shocked and embarrassed to be confronted with this so many years later. I was embarrassed for my family and friends who have stood by me. I also denied my actions to my family, my friends and my staff.'

His opponent in the November election, Cortland lawyer Keith Dayton, did not return a call from The Associated Press seeking comment, but told the Syracuse Post-Standard he wasn't concerned about Mr Suben's acting history.

'I think the more important part is the lying,' he told the newspaper.

Mr Suben has been an acting city court judge, city corporation counsel and a county attorney.

He is past president of the Cortland County Bar Association. He graduated from the University of Rochester, the University of Wisconsin and Fordham Law School, according to the biography on his election website. The bio says he worked seven years as an assistant district attorney in Bronx County then moved to Syracuse. He has taught criminal trial practice as an adjunct professor for 17 years at Syracuse University Law School.
