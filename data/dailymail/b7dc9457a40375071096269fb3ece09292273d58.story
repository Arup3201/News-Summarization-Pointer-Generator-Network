A new face stole the pre-match attention and sold the shirts, but by the end not many here had words about Alexis Sanchez. The thoughts, no matter how fleeting they might be, were all about the reserve striker who suddenly, unexpectedly struck gold and hit Benfica for four.

Yaya Sanogo. Or Yaya Sanogoal, if you prefer. At the Emirates, in the competition of the same name, he had his moment. Four times.

This is a 21-year-old who last season, his first in English football, played 14 games across the competitions and scored none. He was often off the pace. Cut to this fixture and he opened with two poor misses. By the end he had upstaged Sanchez, who appeared after 75 minutes, and had typified a strange result with a delightfully unexpected performance.

For Arsenal, only so much can be drawn from a pre-season match, particularly when the opposition, not matter how gilded, roll over like Benfica did.

But quite aside from the sight of their new £30million striker making his non-competitive debut, they had a number of positive performances to consider. Of the established guard, Aaron Ramsey was superb while the game was still up for grabs; next to him Tomas Rosicky also looked sharp and Joel Campbell, a first-half scorer and provider, likewise.

Perhaps most promising was the early contribution of Hector Bellerin, the 19-year-old they signed from Barcelona in 2011. He bombed on from right-back, created chances and always looked confident. Not much can be said about his defending because Benfica did not present enough of a challenge in that regard, so for the same reason Calum Chambers will have to wait for greater tests.

Of the tests Benfica did offer, Arsenal coped extremely well.  

And this against a side that ordinarily is not too shabby, a club that took a domestic treble last season and came within a penalty shootout of winning the Europa League. They can play and in Nico Gaitan they have a forward who has drawn significant interest from Liverpool.

Getting shirty: Alexis Sanchez was greeted to huge cheers from the Arsenal crowd after coming on

It was Gaitan who rattled Arsenal within the first 10 minutes yesterday. Maxi Pereira had overlapped from right-back and pulled back a cross from the byline to Gaitan, who connected cleanly but saw his half-volley hit the bar.

That was about as good as it got for the Portuguese in an abysmal first half.

Arsenal had already been harshly denied a penalty for a shove on Campbell by the time Sanogo missed a couple of good chances.

First, Ramsey scooped the most exquisite of passes into his path after 15 minutes, only for the 21-year-old, goalless in 14 games last season, to slide and make a hash of the finish. Moments later he stabbed wide a cross from Bellerin.

His breakthrough was nice, though, coming from a backheel flick after Ramsey tricked and then outpaced two down the right before firing a low cross.

Defensive debut: Calum Chambers made his Arsenal debut in central defence after joining for £12million from Southampton

Campbell was given a huge welcome ahead of kick-off, returning after a loan spell at Olympiacos and a fine World Cup with Costa Rica. He is believed to have been mentioned in discussions among AC Milan’s scouting department, but his performance here will not have done much to convince Arsene Wenger that he should be offloaded.

He initially struggled on the right to draw possession, but after switching to the left he showed his knack for finding space. It was from the left that he scored Arsenal’s second, arriving late to volley another excellent delivery from Bellerin.  

Campbell missed a chance for a quick second when he shot wide after a delightful passing move, sweeping the pitch from right to left, but he played a key role in Arsenal’s third.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s shot was saved and Sanogo scuffed the rebound, before Ramsey chipped to Campbell on the left. The forward had space and a sight of goal but instead played a lovely, controlled volley across the six-yard box to Sanogo. It was a tap-in at the end of a nice move.

Sanogo’s hat-trick goal, which like his second was scored in first-half stoppage time, was scrapped in after yet another Benfica defensive error.  

Sanogo got his fourth shortly after the restart, pouncing when Moraes Artur, poor old Moraes Artur, spilled Ramsey’s shot into his path. He tripped while celebrating.

Benfica did pull one back when Gaitan bundled in after Arsenal failed to deal with a long throw. By that point Bebe, the former Manchester United flop, was on the pitch and drawing sarcastic applause; when Sanchez came on he drew a huge roar.

He didn’t score, but he didn’t need to.
