Hector Beltran Leyva, one of
the most notorious Mexican drug lords still at large, was
captured on Wednesday by special forces soldiers at a seafood restaurant in a
picturesque town in central Mexico popular with American
retirees.

The government's announcement it had snared the boss of the
Beltran Leyva cartel is a serious blow to a gang named after a
group of brothers who became infamous for the bloody turf war
they waged with their former ally, Joaquin 'Shorty' Guzman.

Beltran Leyva was caught in the picture postcard town of San
Miguel de Allende, a three-hour drive northwest of Mexico City,
and had been living in the nearby city of Queretaro posing as a
businessman dealing in art and real estate, the government said.

The 49-year-old Beltran Leyva and an associate were carrying
military-issue handguns, but like his adversary Guzman, he was
arrested without a shot being fired. Guzman, who was the world's
most wanted drug boss, was captured in Mexico in February.

Beltran Leyva shunned luxury cars, passing himself off as a
well-off businessman, said Tomas Zeron, director of criminal
investigations at the Attorney General's office.

'(Beltran Leyva) kept his operations away from his home so
as not to alter his discreet, low-key lifestyle, avoiding
attracting the attention of neighbors or friends or the
authorities,' Zeron said.

Beltran Leyva now faces charges of trafficking cocaine from
Mexico and South America to the United States and Europe and a
host of other crimes. In November, the U.S. Treasury Department
said the Beltran Leyva gang was responsible for 'countless
murders' of Mexican anti-drugs and military personnel.

Hector's capture is a major victory for President Enrique
Pena Nieto, who has sought to shift focus away from the violence
that fighting the drug gangs has spawned in recent years and
onto the economic reforms he has pushed through Congress.

Pena Nieto on his Twitter account touted the capture of
Beltran Leyva, who had bounties on his head of $5 million in the
United States and 30 million pesos ($2.2 million) in Mexico.

Hector, who Zeron said had likely branched out into selling
synthetic drugs, was the only one of the gang's brothers known
to be involved in drug trafficking not dead or behind bars.

When Mexican special forces arrested Alfredo Beltran Leyva
in early 2008, the brothers reportedly believed Guzman had sold
out their sibling, sparking a war with the boss of the Sinaloa
Cartel based in the northwestern state of the same name.

Over the next three years, the rupture ushered in a new
brutality to the violence that overshadowed the 2006-2012
administration of then-President Felipe Calderon.

By 2010, the Beltran Leyvas had lost several leaders and
Hector, alias 'The Engineer,' was in control.

The Beltran Leyva gang has had a reputation as one of the
most vengeful and ruthless in the business.

When Hector's older brother Arturo was killed by Mexican
marines in December 2009, the government honored one of the
young marines slain in the raid and images of the family funeral
were broadcast around the country.

The next day, gunmen swept into the family home and killed
the marine's mother, sister, brother and an aunt.

For years, the Beltran Leyva brothers had worked with other
Sinaloan gangsters, notably Guzman, helping to manage his 
network of hitmen. The brothers and Guzman hailed from the same
region of Sinaloa, and marriages also linked the two clans.

Guzman reportedly tasked the Beltran Leyva organization with
infiltrating Mexico's security and political apparatus.

Security experts went as far as to credit Hector Beltran
Leyva with having an informant inside the office of
then-President Vicente Fox a decade ago. The official, Nahum
Acosta, was arrested in 2005 but later released for lack of
evidence.

At its peak, the Beltran Leyva cartel dominated
drug-trafficking in western Mexico. After the break with Guzman,
the brothers forged alliances of convenience with former rivals
in the Gulf Cartel as well as the ruthless Zetas.

After Arturo's death, the Beltran Leyva organization was
weakened by infighting as a split emerged between Hector and a
faction led by U.S.-born Edgar Valdez Villarreal, alias 'La
Barbie,' whom Mexican authorities arrested in August 2010.

Lately, however, U.S. officials said that the Beltran Leyva
cartel had begun to expand after rebuilding itself.
