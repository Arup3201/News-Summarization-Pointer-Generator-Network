As Princess Eugenie stepped out last night with her boyfriend of three years, the growing resemblance between her beau and her father was more striking than ever.

When she picked barman Jack Brooksbank as her boyfriend, it's unlikely Princess Eugenie realised he would eventually become the spitting image of his potential father-in-law Prince Andrew.

The pair were pictured leaving the launch party of Mr Fogg's in London last night looking more in love than ever after spending the evening with Pippa and James Middleton along with their partners Nico Jackson and Donna Air.

The pair, who have been dating since 2010, looked very much in love as they shared a joke leaving the launch party of Mr Fogg's

Eugenie looked elegant in a long sleeved white mini dress with a black belt emphasizing her waist.

The dress featured a black lace panel at the front and the 23-year-old princess accessorised with summery black cork-soled wedges which made the most of her slim, tanned legs, and a black handbag.

She held hands and shared a laugh, with 26-year-old Jack who buttoned up against the cold in a classic dark wool pea coat with the collar pulled up.

Underneath he wore dark suit trousers and shoes, in the same discreet and smart fashion so often seen on Eugenie’s father Prince Andrew.

And with his curly dark hair and pale complexion, the similarity between Jack and his potential future father-in-law was undeniable. 

The couple are in fact distant cousins, sharing common ancestry, but Jack, 26, keeps his feet firmly on the ground working as a waiter in London

Jack may be working as a waiter and a barman, but his heritage is in fact exactly what you would expect from a royal escort.

He was educated at pricey public school Stowe and has an aristocratic background.

In fact, so blue is his blood that he and Eugenie are actually distant cousins, with two of their closest common ancestors being Thomas William Coke, the 2nd Earl of Leicester (died 1909) and Edward Lascelles, 1st Earl of Harewood (died 1820).

Pippa Middleton and boyfriend Nico James also attended the launch party last night

James Middleton (brother of the Duchess Of Cambridge) and Donna Air joined the A list crowd at the opening of Mr Fogg's in Mayfair

Eugenie, who recently graduated  from Newcastle with a degree in English literature and history of art, is clearly besotted with Jack, whom she has introduced to her family.

Jack has even been on holiday with Eugenie’s mother Sarah Duchess of York and her sister Princess Beatrice.

Though her parents divorced when she was just 6 years old, both Eugenie and her sister remain close to their father, who is fourth in line to the throne.
