A thief who avoided jail by faking a pregnancy has finally been locked up after her lies unravelled.

Lisa Philips, 37, told police she was 13 weeks pregnant when she was arrested for stealing £14,700 from her aunt and spending it on beauty treatments and a PlayStation.

By the time she had her day in court, the total was seven months - so a judge took pity on her and suspended  jail  as she rubbed her 'bump'.

Now you see it... Thief Lisa Philips, 37, has finally been locked up after faking a pregnancy to avoid jail. She is pictured left after her  hearing for stealing from her aunt last year - where she held her 'bump' - and right today

Philips originally received a four-month sentence suspended for two years last October for stealing £14,700 from her aunt Tracy Sedgewick.

A court heard the resident of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham - who has a 16-year-old son - was concerned her aunt's partner Ahmet Oktar, 41, was going to take the money out of the country.

But instead of putting away the money for safekeeping she bought a large TV and PlayStation as well as beauty treatments and designer goods.

When police investigated she showed them a false NatWest bank statement she had created, and later pleaded guilty.

But when she was first arrested in June she told the custody sergeant she was 13 weeks pregnant - an elaborate lie she maintained for months, Teesside Crown Court heard today. 

She was even photographed holding her 'bump' as she left court, prosecutor Paul Cleasby said.

Probation officers became suspicious after her due date had passed and there was no baby to be found.

She showed them pictures of a child she claimed to be her baby, and said the child was staying with a relative, before eventually claiming she had lost the pregnancy.

When she was challenged about what had really happened she finally agreed she had lied to police. 

The prosecutor said: 'She claimed she had panicked, she had not set out to improve her situation. Once the lie had been told she simply could not retract.

'The probation team were suspicious but gave her the benefit of the doubt.

'They would ask her about the progress of the pregnancy and the defendant continued to lie.'

Philips pleaded guilty to one count of perverting the course of justice. 

Ben Pegman, defending, said: 'She is genuinely sorry, embarrassed and ashamed for her actions.

'What started as a lie given in expediency when she was first arrested by the police has spiralled into something extremely serious.

'She recognises she had opportunities throughout the proceedings to correct the lie she gave to police.'

Judge Peter Armstrong, who  handed down the original suspended sentence for theft, said this time an immediate jail term was required.

He said her fake pregnancy had been taken into account when he decided to spare her jail last year - despite him feeling  a custodial sentence was 'richly deserved'.

'You avoided jail because of your bogus mitigation,' he told her. 'It would be wholly unjust, not just to Tracy Sedgewick but to the public, if that was to happen again.

'You conned your aunt and then during the course of mitigation you said you were expecting a child only months away so the court took that into account and suspended the sentence.

'This was an lie made out of panic and an attempt to protect your son seeing you being taken away in handcuffs.' 

But Philips' victim Tracy Sedgewick, 46,  hit out at today's sentence branding it 'disgusting'.

'Lisa will be out in a few months,' she said. 'What I really wanted was for her to be ordered by the court to pay the money back. I have been in debt because of Lisa since 2011.

'Me and my partner Ahmet have managed to pay most of it back, but the whole thing has had an horrific impact on our lives. We have been scrimping and scraping to get by.'
