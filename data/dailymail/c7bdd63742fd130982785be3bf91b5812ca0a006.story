Jailed: Kay showed no emotion as he was sentenced to six years behind bars

A groom who caused more than £5million of damage after setting fire to a castle in a row over a bar bill was yesterday jailed for six years.

Max Kay, 37, had drunk more than 20 double vodkas when he set a pair of curtains on fire with a cigarette lighter.

He had earlier made threatening comments and told staff: ‘Nobody crosses Max.’

A judge said it was a ‘miracle’ that no one was killed in the blaze, which started directly under the bridal suite where Kay’s new wife was sleeping.

Kay had spent almost £30,000 on a lavish reception at the country house hotel at Grade I-listed Peckforton Castle, near Tarporley, Cheshire, to give fiancée Stephanie the day of her dreams.

Judge Roger Dutton told the property developer, who had previously been declared bankrupt, that he could not afford such extravagant nuptials but went ahead with them because his ‘ego’ dictated that he wanted to impress family and friends.

‘With a hotel full of your guests you quite deliberately set fire to it... putting the lives of your guests and the staff at the hotel and those brave firefighters who came to deal with it at risk,’ he said.

‘It was a miracle that nobody was either seriously hurt or killed by your action.’

Duncan Bould, prosecuting, told the court that Kay, a father of four, had been paying the bill in instalments prior to the wedding on June 18 last year.

But each time one was due the hotel, which is owned by the Naylor family, struggled to get the money from him.

Inferno: The fire started by Kay caused around £5.4 million damage to Peckforton Castle Hotel

Danger: After hearing Kay's threats, the hotel's
owners said they could not believe he would risk the lives of his own 
friends and relatives, including his new bride Stephanie, right, by 
attempting to burn down the castle 

Revenge: Kay took 'revenge' while 'massively' drunk after bar staff refused him any more credit

Peckforton
Castle was built in the 1840s in the Gothic revival style complete with
portcullis, moat and arrow slots and stands on a prominent ridge of 
hills in rural Cheshire near Tarporley.

St
Pancras architect Sir George Gilbert Scott hailed it as ‘the largest 
and most carefully and learnedly executed Gothic mansion of the 
present’.

The grade one
listed building has frequently been used for filming including episodes
of Dr Who and a 1991 production of Robin Hood featuring Uma Thurman.

After
being converted into a hotel it was bought by current owners the Naylor
family in 2005 who spent £1.7million turning it into one of Cheshire’s 
most sought-after wedding venues with packages costing £6,000 or more.

The final instalment – of £15,000 – was paid just three days before the event, after the hotel threatened to cancel.

The wedding went ahead but  by 10pm staff informed Kay that the £3,000 free bar was about to run out.

He claimed to have paid another £2,000 up front, but staff, aware of the financial history, refused to give him more credit and an argument ensued. He started making threatening comments about the Naylor family, in particular Kate Naylor, the finance director, to other staff.

‘He described her to witnesses as a b****, he said that she was “going to get it”,’ Mr Bould said.

‘He was full of bravado, making threatening comments, saying “nobody crosses Max”.’

Chester Crown Court heard that Kay was
caught on CCTV going into a drawing room. Investigators later 
discovered that the fire, which caused £5.4million of damage, had been 
started in that room.

A total of 117 people, including 13 
children and a disabled man using a wheelchair, had to be evacuated and 
more than 100 firemen from four counties were scrambled to tackle the 
blaze.

Kay, of Halewood, Liverpool, who last 
week became a father to premature twins, admitted arson that was 
reckless as to whether life was endangered. His wife is standing by him.

Lucky escape: Guests were forced to flee the inferno which Kay started while many were 'vulnerable' and asleep in their beds

Destruction: The blaze tore through the Grade I-listed building within minutes and required dozens of firefighters to bring it under control

Devastation: Dozens of firefighters were called to the blaze which tore through the venue while guests were drunk, in bed and 'highly vulnerable'
