Abolishing GCSEs: Education Secretary Michael Gove is to axe 'dumbed-down' exams and bring back a tough new O-level style system

Michael Gove is to herald an end to a quarter of a century of ‘dumbed-down’ exams this week when he abolishes GCSEs and brings back a tough new O-level style system.

The Education Secretary will announce the new exams on Tuesday in a joint press conference with Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg after a furious behind-the-scenes row between the two men.

Mr Clegg has forced Mr Gove to delay the new system until September 2015, which means Labour could scrap it if they win the next Election, due in May 2015.

But Mr Gove won his battle to ensure the new exams are more rigorous and that the top grades only go to the brightest children. The joint appearance on Tuesday is designed to counter claims of another Coalition rift.

The reforms are designed to help schools in England catch up with other countries which have left us trailing in school standards.

The new exams, dubbed ‘Gove- levels’, follow claims that GCSEs, which replaced O-levels in 1986, are too easy. Under Mr Gove’s shake-up, the current system whereby nearly three in ten pupils get A or A* grades will go. Instead as few as one in ten will get the top mark, Grade 1. 

Marks will depend on a traditional ‘all or nothing’ three-hour exam at the end of the two-year course, rather than the current system in which up to half the grading is based on modules and continual assessment, followed by a 90-minute exam at the end.

Pupils will no longer be able to bump up their grades with endless re-sits of each exam module. In future they will have to re-sit the entire exam, which is expected to deter most.

There will be more complex algebra questions in maths exams and a return to essays in English literature exams instead of trendy GCSE ‘bite sized’ answers.

Catch up: The new exams are more rigorous and top grades will only go to the brightest children in an attempt to help English schools catch up with other countries as we trail in school standards

And in a controversial move designed to 
counter claims that GCSEs are far too easy for bright pupils, questions 
in the new exam will be graded, starting with easy questions and 
building up to difficult questions which will stretch the cleverest 
pupils.

It means that less able pupils may be unable to complete the paper. But Mr Gove will argue it is vital to boost standards.

In addition, the new exams will be run by a single exam board following complaints that competition between rival boards is driving down standards. 

Board officials have been accused of boasting how easy their exams are, and giving tips to teachers on the content of papers. Ministers said the current rules had created a ‘race to the bottom’ in standards.

According to a 2010 OECD study of 
15-year-olds, the UK fell from 17th to 25th for reading, 24th to 28th 
for maths and 14th to 16th in science over a three-year period.

Mr Clegg was furious earlier this year when Mr Gove suggested replacing GCSEs with a two-tier exam, with a new version of O-levels for top pupils and a new version of CSEs, also abolished in 1986, for less able youngsters. Mr Clegg accused Mr Gove of acting in an ‘insulting and patronising’ manner by failing to consult him in advance.

'Schools will be given time to up their game'

Mr Clegg’s main objection was that this system would be ‘elitist’ and would ‘stigmatise’ children considered not bright enough.

The two men thrashed out their differences in a series of meetings over the summer. Mr Gove won his battle to ensure the exams can test so-called ‘elite’ pupils. 

However, Coalition insiders say there could be further Tory-Lib Dem friction as details of the new single tier exam emerge.

‘Gove is determined to ensure it is much more demanding than the existing exam,’ said one source. 

‘Schools will be given time to raise their game and adjust to that. If they can’t, or decide their pupils simply aren’t up to taking the new exam they may be forced to find a different option. That could reopen the debate about having another, less difficult exam.’

Mr Clegg persuaded Mr Gove to delay starting the new exams until September 2015, arguing that a 2014 deadline would cause chaos in schools. It was a blow to Mr Gove who had hoped to show the system was up and running before the next Election. Furthermore, the 2015 start date – with the first new exams in 2017 – means that, in theory, if Ed Miliband wins the next Election, the new exams could be scrapped weeks before they are due to begin. 

It is certain to put education at the heart of the next Election campaign.When Mr Gove first floated his ideas of a two-tier exam system, Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg called it ‘a cap on aspiration’ and accused Mr Gove of ‘harking back to a nostalgic view of the past’.

The new proposals are also expected to run into fierce opposition from teaching unions who claim they could ‘lower aspirations and exacerbate inequalities in society’.

Tuesday’s announcement is a key moment in the fast-rising political career of former journalist Mr Gove, brought up by adoptive parents and partly state-educated. A growing number of Tories believe he is a contender to succeed David Cameron as Tory leader, though Mr Gove has laughed off such reports, offering to ‘sign a parchment in my own blood to prove I do not want to be Prime Minister’.

NOW Tens of thousands of pupils can bump up grades by re-sitting parts of the GCSE exams until they get a pass.IN FUTURE Partial resits will end. Pupils will be forced to resit the entire exam.

NOW Final exam can be as short as 90 minutes IN FUTURE Three-hour exams.

NOW Maths exams have little algebra, English exams include ‘bite sized’ replies and rigorous English-to-foreign-language translations are rare.IN FUTURE More algebra in maths exams, more full length essays in English and a return to full English-to-foreign-language translation tests.

NOW Up to 50 per cent of exams are studied via modules and continual assessment.IN FUTURE Replaced by one exam at end of two-year course.

NOW Technically, everyone who gets a grade from A to G grade is deemed to have achieved  a ‘pass’.IN FUTURE New 1 to 6 pass grade, 7 onwards will be fail.

NOW 22 per cent get A or A* grade. Around seven per cent of all candidates gain an A*. IN FUTURE As few as five per cent may get Grade 1.
