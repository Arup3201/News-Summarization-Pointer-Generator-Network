An outbreak of bubonic plague has killed 40 people in less than three months, the World Health Organisation said.

There have been 119 confirmed cases of the disease reported in Madagascar since late August and experts fear there is a risk of it spreading 'rapidly.'

Two per cent of the cases recorded on the Indian Ocean island have been pneumonic plague, 'one of the most deadly infectious diseases,' that can kill within 24 hours.

An outbreak of bubonic plague has killed 40 people in less than three months in  Madagascar, the World Health Organisation have said

Health experts now fear the greatest risk could be in the capital, Antananarivo, where high population density and a weaknesses in the health care system could see it quickly spread.

To date only two cases of plague and one death have been recorded there.

Plague is a bacterial disease that is mainly spread from one rodent to another by fleas.

Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which swells the lymph node and can be treated with antibiotics.

If the bacteria reaches the lungs the patient develops pneumonic plague, which is passed from person-to-person through coughing.

The first known case of the plague in Madagascar was identified in a man from Soamahatamana on August 31.He died on September 3.

The authorities in Madagascar alerted the World Health Organisation at the beginning of November.

 The organisation said it had not recommend any trade or travel restrictions due to the outbreak.

They said the last previously known outbreak of the plague was in Peru in August 2010.

Bubonic plague killed around 100 million people during the 14th century and was known as the 'Black Death.' 

Drawings and paintings from the outbreak, which wiped out about a third of the European population, depict town criers saying 'bring out your dead' while dragging trailers piled with infected corpses.

It is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats.

The disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin, armpits or neck, known as 'buboes'.

It kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated, although if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection patients are highly likely to survive.

After the Black Death arrived in 1347 plague became a common phenomenon in Europe, with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century.

Bubonic plague has almost completely vanished from the developed world, with 90 per cent of all cases now found in Africa.
