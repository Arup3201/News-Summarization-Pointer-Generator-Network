A former exotic dancer is suing the Dallas Cowboys and club's owner  Jerry Jones for $1million for sexual assault, claiming the 71-year-old business man groped her in a hotel bathroom.

In an 11-page court document, Jana Weckerly of Ardmore, Carter County, Oklahoma claims she was sexually assaulted by Jones in either May or June 2009 and that the Dallas Cowboys should have done something to prevent it. 

The alleged assault is believed to have taken place in the bathroom of a luxury hotel.

Billionaire Jerry Jones, pictured, claims he has been 'misrepresented' in the photos which were leaked online

A spokesman for Jones, who has been married for 50 years, said the photographs were part of 'a shake down'

According to TMZ.com, the two women in the photographs are former strippers from Dallas called Lindzie, blonde and Jordan, brunette. The pair are understood to be consulting their own lawyers. 

Ms Weckerly claimed that Jones had 'forcibly rubbed' or grabbed her buttocks and breasts multiple times without her consent.

The 27-year-old former exotic dancer also claims that Jones forced her to 'touch/and or rub' his penis and that 'forcibly penetrated' her with his fingers.

The court document said that Jones forced her to watch a second woman perform a sex act on him. 

According to the document, seen my MailOnline: 'The conduct of defendant Jerry Jones was in violation of state and federal criminal statutes regarding sexual abuse.' 

Ms Weckerly claims that Jones' actions constitute 'extreme and outrageous conduct', accusing both the businessman and the football club of intentionally causing 'severe emotional distress'. 

The law suit also claims that the Dallas Cowboys failed to supervise Jones properly and should have introduced 'policies for the protection of females'. 

The document said: 'The reputation of Jerry Jones and Cowboys and the desire to avoid scandal were vastly superior and more important to the Cowboys than the welfare of the plaintiff and other victims who have been sexually abused by Jerry Jones.'

Ms Weckerly accused the Dallas Cowboys of 'fostering an environment and culture where abuse of females could flourish'. She said Jones had 'dangerous sexual propensities' towards women. 

The court document also claims that Jones and the Dallas Cowboys tried to cover up the alleged assault while Ms Weckerly said she was in fear for her life.  

The Dallas Morning News reported that photos of the alleged incident were published online last month. 

Jones told the paper: 'Someone has misrepresented photos taken at a restaurant five years ago for their own purposes. I'm just not going to comment on it.' 

However, Ms Weckerly's lawyer Thomas Bowers said his client was in counselling and is taking medication to cope with the trauma. 

He said: 'If anybody did something wrong, it was the Cowboys and Jerry Jones,” Bowers said. “Sometimes powerful people think they can get by with anything.

'It’s amazing how athletes are held to a different standard than the owners, who are allowed to do things an athlete would probably lose his job for. So, it’ll be very curious to see what the league does with this.'

However, the Dallas Cowboys dismissed Ms Weckerly's claims. In a statement issued to 11alive.com, club spokesman Rich Dalrymple said they would be contesting the case. 

He said: 'These allegations are completely false.

'This is nothing more than an attempt to embarrass and extort Jerry Jones. This is a shakedown by a lawyer who is a solo practitioner just trying to make a name for himself.The alleged incidents would have been more than five years old. We intend to vigorously contest this complaint and expect it will be shown for what it is -- a money grab. Due to the seriousness of these baseless allegations, we have also involved law enforcement.'
