Two great white sharks spotted off the coast of Chatham, Massachusetts, on Tuesday are regulars in the region according to the expert who tagged them.

‘They’re here every year,’ Greg Skomal works with the state Division of Marine Fisheries told The Boston Globe. ‘We’ve been [tagging them] since 2009.’

The Cape Cod area was famously used as the setting for the Jaws movies, which feature a gigantic man-eating great white shark.

According to a post on the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy’s Facebook page, they spotted at least 10 other sharks on Tuesday

The sharks are most frequently found on the east-facing beaches of Cape Cod, rather than the calm beaches of the popular Nantucket Sound

However there is no imminent danger for holidaymakers.

The two white sharks represent the ninth and tenth great whites to be tagged by the marine fisheries division off the Massachusetts coast in 2014. The animals are tagged to study their migratory habits.

It is thought that one of the main reasons the animal is drawn to the Cape Cod area is because nearby Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge has a huge population of seals, which are a favorite food of the great white shark.

They were photographed by Wayne Davis, a spotter pilot with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy.
