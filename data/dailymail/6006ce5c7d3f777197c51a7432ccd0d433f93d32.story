Their fans may be calling for the manager to be sacked, as their title hopes go from speculative to non-existent, but Arsenal's captain has suggested his side should be pleased with their latest performance.

Arsenal lost 2-1 at home to Manchester United on Saturday, but Mikel Arteta believes it was his side's best game of the season.

The midfielder bemoaned his side's ability to take their chances, but stressed that Arsenal deserved to get something out of the game.

Mikel Arteta said he was socked at the result on Saturday after Arsenal's 'good performance'

'I'm shocked,' Arteta said after the defeat. 'I think we played our best game this season in terms of what we demand of ourselves – the quality in the way we attacked, how we won the ball back, how consistent we were throughout, the amount of chances we created.

'When you are in the box and you can't manage to score in that many situations, you can't expect to win.

'It's not fair for the players and the fans. How can I explain the result? I can't.

'I am shocked and frustrated because we did not deserve this result considering the opposition we were playing against.

The Gunners skipper blamed 'bad luck', rather than naive tactics or a lack of quality, for the disappointing result, claiming that Arsenal were 'absolutely hammering United'. 

'I can only put it down to bad luck on the first goal which totally changed the game, at a time when we were absolutely controlling and hammering United.

'After they took the lead we had to take more risks to try to get back into the game and United have the players up front to cause you problems at any time.

'But I feel so sorry for the lads and for our supporters because they were terrific and I don't think we deserved this result.'

'It's [a lack of] ruthlessness, for sure. When you are in the box and you can't manage to score in that many situations, you can't expect to win.'
