This is the heartwarming moment a six-year-old boy bursts into laughter after moving his arm for the first time since undergoing brain surgery - as he feeds treats to a lovable black Labrador.

Jack Doss was left with limited mobility in his left side after he suffered a stroke during a major operation to remove a brain tumour.

To improve the mobility in his arm, Jack is undergoing intense physical therapy exercises, including lifting his hand above his head to feed treats to a dog waiting patiently behind him.

Jack Doss, 6, feeds biscuits to a dog waiting patiently behind him as part of his physical therapy exercises following brain surgery. The young boy can be seen bursting into laughter when the dog takes the treat

Jack's father Tyler, 30, who posted a video of the therapy session to Youtube, told MailOnline it was the first time his son had  moved his arm since the operation.

The video shows Jack bursting into laughter as the dog, called Tank, takes the biscuit from his hand.

Mr Doss, of Orrville, Ohio, said the brain tumour was discovered after Jack started suffering headaches at the beginning of May.

He underwent surgery on July 18 when doctors took out 90 to 95 per cent of the tumour. During the operation however, little Jack suffered a stroke.

Mr Doss said: 'Our surgeon told us that he could have some left side issues and so his left arm and leg weren't working.

'So he started physical therapy that next Wednesday.' 

His father Tyler Doss has posted a  video online which shows Jack taking part in the exercise session. In the video, Jack is told if he is able to lift his arm four times to feed treats to the dog then he will get a new bike

Mr Doss said the hospital where Jack is being treated has between 20 and 25 dogs that work with children undergoing physical therapy sessions.

He said: 'That video was the first time he had moved his arm. I got home from work and my wife showed me that, so I was pretty happy.' 

Mr Doss said his son enjoys working with the dogs as he goes through the exercise sessions.

He said: 'His favourite thing is animals - he loves animals. They make things a lot better for him during therapy.'
