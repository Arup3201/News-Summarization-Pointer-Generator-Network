Determined: Jess Bacon, 16, went to sit her GCSEs just hours after her father died

On the first day of her GCSEs in May, 16-year-old Jess Bacon kissed her father goodbye, put on her school uniform and headed off to the exam hall.

Anyone who'd seen Jess's wan face that morning might have assumed it was down to pre-exam nerves. But only a few hours earlier, she had been sitting with her beloved father, Martin - a teacher - as he drew his last breath. He was just 46 and died after battling a brain tumour.

The gentle kiss on his cheek that morning had been Jess's final farewell. A few hours later, she was sitting her first paper.

'My studies had mattered so much to Dad. He was so determined he was going to live long enough for me to finish my GCSEs,' says Jess. 'The very least I could do for him was keep calm and do my best, regardless of what had just happened.

'Normally I find exams terrifying, but I felt a strange calmness that day.'

Her fortitude in the midst of intense grief, is, she says, a reflection of the support her family received from the Sue Ryder hospice in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, where her father's last days were spent surrounded by laughter and love.

'Walking away from him after he died was the hardest thing I've ever had to do,' says Jess. 'But he found peace at Thorpe Hall Hospice - and so did we.

'You can't sit and think "Why me? Life isn't fair", when you are among people who make you feel full of hope and surrounded by love, as we were at the hospice.

'The kindness of the volunteers was astonishing. Dad became unsteady on his feet, and one night when he was alone in his hospice room, he thought he heard someone calling for help. He tried to get  out of bed to go to them, and fell.

'After that, we didn't want him to be on his own at night. Mum said she would be there every evening, but the volunteers drew up a rota among themselves.

'From that moment on, incredible people - retired grandmothers, nurses who had already finished a 12-hour shift at the local hospital - took it in turns to be by his bedside night after night.

Happier times: Jess with father Martin, mother Kathleen, and brother Josh

'One lovely lady was in her thirties and had a young baby. She must have had constant nights of broken sleep at home, but every week, would give up one of them to chat and read to patients. Another had seen her own mother pass away at the hospice, and now came in for the night shift.

The volunteers never asked for praise or thanks, but the kindness of these strangers was awe-inspiring.'

Before Martin's illness, the Bacon family had a happy life  together in Peterborough. Their mother, Kathleen, was a teacher, and Jess and her younger brother Josh, went to the local school where Martin once taught.

Jess smiles at the memory of those days, and says: 'Dad had always been incredibly enthusiastic and was always joking. At the end of each week, he'd come home and say "It's that Friday night feeling everyone!"'

But last spring, super-fit Martin, who regularly did charity runs and triathlons, began suffering from appalling headaches.

As wife Kathleen, 46, recalls: 'He became more and more tired. For weeks, he suffered from crippling headaches which didn't seem to shift with painkillers. Martin had never even taken a day off sick, and always leapt out of bed at 5.15 am to go for a jog. But his energy had vanished.'

He kept working, but in July after weeks of terrible migraines, he had one that lasted for three days and made him vomit. Kathleen took him to A&E.

Fond memories: Jess with her father Martin, before he moved to Thorpe Hall hospice

Martin had a brain scan, and shortly afterwards doctors told them there was a large tumour in Martin's brain which would need to be removed.

It was devastating news - but worse was to come. Three days later, a surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge explained the tumour was almost as big as a fist. He could remove 90 per cent of it, but Martin would then need radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

However, before he had surgery, Martin collapsed and a new scan revealed there was bleeding around his tumour. A seven-hour operation saved his life, but he developed an infection. More emergency surgery was required.

A month later the two were given more bad news. Kathleen says: 'We were told Martin had just nine to 12 months to live. It was devastating. I wept, but Martin was so brave. He believed in God and said he wasn't scared. We decided not to tell the children it was terminal, but to say it was aggressive.'

Even that news was terrifying, says Jess.

'We all cried, but it wasn't long before Dad was joking again. Things like, "Well, I always have been unique! Trust me to get the worse tumour possible!" Just before Christmas, he was told he had even more tumours in his brain, and his reaction was "I'd better make a collection of them!".'

Despite the family's  attempts at positivity, in January, just as he prepared for chemotherapy, doctors found he had a tumour on his spine.

'We were told Martin had just nine to 12 months to live,' says Kathleen. 'It was devastating. I wept, but Martin was so brave.'

His mobility rapidly worsened, and it became apparent Martin needed more care than his family could give. At their Macmillan nurse's recommendation, Martin moved to Thorpe Hall in April.

Martin remained calm. But his family were in turmoil.

'Mum and Dad told us in January, he wasn't going to get better,' says Jess. 'Dad was determined not to die at home, because he didn't want us to walk into a room and think, "This is where Dad passed away."

'But Dad absolutely loved the hospice. He just felt so welcome and at ease there. It made it far easier for the rest of us. Everyone was so welcoming.

'Dad, of course, was still laughing and joking. A lady came into Dad's room and announced she did complementary massage, and Dad replied 'Is that legal?' We all collapsed laughing.

'Josh saw Dad every day after school. I spent my study leave at Thorpe Hall, doing my revision.

'After a while, everyone knew us by name. We'd walk down the corridor and staff would hug us.'

As Martin weakened, the family spent more time at the hospice.

'Josh's 14th birthday was in April. He had planned to spend it with friends, but didn't want to leave Dad. So the nurses and volunteers baked Josh a birthday cake for us all to share.'

Jess says, unlike in many hospitals, where staff are rushed off their feet, 'at the hospice, nobody was too busy to chat.'

Emotions were high, however.

Grieving: Husband and father Martin passed away at the hospice, leaving his family behind

'One day, it all became too much for me. But then a volunteer called Ursula told me: "He's still here now and you can talk to him - towards the end of someone's life they are in a coma, and you won't get that chance again. So spend that time together now."

'I went back to Dad's bed, took his hand in mine, and just sat talking to him. I will forever be grateful for her advice.'

As Martin deteriorated, the family moved into his room, all sleeping on mattresses on the floor.

Jess says: 'We've always done everything together, the four of us. The doctors let us know what was happening at each stage. I knew they'd give me an honest answer to anything I asked.

'We had hoped Dad would come home, but in the end he only spent three weeks at the hospice.

'He was just sleeping in his last week, but we stayed with him, holding his hands, kissing him, and talking through all the wonderful family memories

'It was so peaceful and quiet, and a time to reflect together as a family. I don't think we'd have ever had that privacy, or the chance to just be together, in a hospital setting. It meant that nothing was left unsaid.

'The morning Dad passed away was the hardest. We gave him a kiss, and it was really difficult for us all to leave the room. But Mum explained it was his body that was left behind, and his soul had left.

'I went home and had an hour and-a-half to pull myself together and put my school uniform on.'

Jess was awarded 2 A*s, 4 As and 6 Bs in her GCSEs and is currently studying for her A-levels.

Along with her mother and brother, Jess continues to visit the hospice and receive counselling. She says: 'It became a home, and it helped us through the toughest point of our lives. I'll never forget the love there was for Dad - and all of us.  

'The day Dad died, Josh baked cakes, then went back to the hospice and handed them around. It was just hours after Dad had died, but it was the best way Josh could think of to say thanks.'

Martin, the father who joked until the end alongside the family he adored, would be so proud.
