Paul Lambert has told Darren Bent his exile from the Aston Villa team was ‘nothing personal’ and suggested the ex-England striker might look at himself for answers. 

The Scot also revealed there was no interest from top-flight teams in Bent, who at £18million is Villa’s record signing.

Bent moved to Championship club Derby County this month on a deal until June to effectively end his four-year stay at Villa Park. His £65,000-a-week contract finishes this summer.

Bent questioned whether his exile was a personal snub from the Aston Villa manager

Earlier this month Bent, 30, questioned whether his absence from the Villa side was a personal snub from Lambert, who said: ‘I think Darren has got to be honest with himself. If you ask anyone here they’d tell you it’s nothing personal. 

'I never stood in his way to go to any other club. The only clubs that came in for him were Championship clubs — not one Premier League club. That says a lot.’

Bent has joined Championship side Derby on loan until the end of the season
