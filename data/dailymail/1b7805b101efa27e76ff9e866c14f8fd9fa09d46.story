Police have released CCTV images of two people they wish to speak to after Jordan Brennan (pictured) was found dead

Police have launched a murder inquiry following the death of a teenager who was attacked outside a grocer's store.

Jordan Brennan, 17, was assaulted by a man as he left the shop in Gorton, Manchester, on Friday at about 7.30pm.

Emergency services were called to his home address the following day at about 9am after he was found unresponsive in bed.

He was pronounced dead at the scene and a post-mortem examination later found the cause of death was a head injury.

Police have launched a murder inquiry and want to speak to a man and woman about the incident at the shop on Hyde Road.

Detective Inspector Theresa Carter said: 'Jordan was very well known and liked and both his family and the wider community are deeply shocked and saddened by what happened.

'At this stage we know that Jordan was assaulted outside the grocer's store, but we don't know exactly what led up to the assault.

'I would also ask that the man involved contacts the police so that we can fully understand what happened inside and outside the shop.

We would also like to speak to the woman who he was with.'

Police have issued CCTV images of the man and woman they wish to speak to. Both are of Chinese appearance and aged about 25 to 30.

The man had a stocky or chubby build and black hair and was wearing a white shirt and a black suit jacket and trousers.

The woman was slim and had long black straight hair.

In a statement, Jordan's mother, Kim, said: 'Our son Jordan Brennan was 17 years old and was a well liked young man.

'He was a loveable rogue and was always polite and keen to help anyone who needed his help, be that physical help or just to listen to a friend.

'He would cheer them up with his usual larking about or joking around.

'He was a pleasure to have as a son and his loss is devastating. He was greatly loved by all that knew him.'
