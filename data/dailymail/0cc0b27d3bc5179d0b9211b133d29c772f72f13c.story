A three-year-old boy has been killed after he was hit by a tractor on the family farm.

Benny Norris was rushed to hospital in Bath after the accident which happened at 10.30am yesterday in the village of Whatley, near Frome, but could not be saved.

Today police said his family were 'distraught' following the tragedy which is believed to have happened as a tractor was coming down a slope near some farm buildings at the family-owned Summerfield Farm in the picturesque Somerset village.

Benny Norris, three, died after he was hit by a tractor in an accident on his family's Summerfield Farm near Frome

Today the child's uncle Philip Norris, 36, said: 'The person that died was my nephew Benny.  That's all I am going to say for now.'

The farm, which is scattered around the village, is thought to be jointly owned by Benny's grandparents, Jennifer and John Norris, who are in their 60s, and their sons, who run different parts of it.

One neighbour, who asked not to be 
named, said: 'A good friend of ours was killed on Tuesday by a tractor 
that came down a slope.

'I'm not really sure what happened 
but I saw all the emergency services arrive. It's all very sad. We knew 
him as Ben but the family called him Benny.'

Police, paramedics and an air ambulance were called to the farm after the accident, which is now being investigated by police and the Health and Safety Executive as a matter of procedure.

Detective Sergeant Rachel Whelan, of the Public Protection Unit, said: 'Our thoughts are very much with the boy's family, who have left distraught by his death.

'A multi-agency investigation is under way in accordance with national rapid response protocols following the unexpected death of any child.

'At this time we are treating this as a tragic accident.'

A spokesman for South West Ambulance Service said: 'We received a call shortly after 10.30am on Tuesday where we attended the farm in Frome.

'Three ambulance resources were sent as well as an air ambulance also attending.  The patient was taken to the Royal United Hospital in Bath.'

Police have confirmed they are investigating the incident along with the Health and Safety Executive.

Police said they were to the farm following a collision between a tractor and the three-year-old boy.
