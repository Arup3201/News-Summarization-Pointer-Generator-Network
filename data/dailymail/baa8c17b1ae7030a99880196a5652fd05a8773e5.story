New AC Milan manager Pippo Inzaghi has said Mario Balotelli will be give a chance to prove himself worthy of a place in the side.

Inzaghi played over 200 games for the Rossoneri, winning two league titles and two Champions Leagues along the way. Although Balotelli's reputation precedes him, the new manager made it clear he will be given a clean slate.

The 40-year-old said: 'Balotelli is a very important player and belongs to Milan. I'll interact with him in the way I do with other players.

'I'll forget everything I've heard about him either in a good or a bad way because I want to get to know people to get the best out of them.'

Inzaghi recently replaced former teammate Clarence Seedorf in charge of Milan but he already has a clear idea of how Balotelli fits in to his plans

He said: 'The club make the decisions but, for me, Mario is a talented guy who plays for Milan and the national team.

'He should be a second striker because he is the first reference point along with Pazzini. I think we'll stay that way.'
