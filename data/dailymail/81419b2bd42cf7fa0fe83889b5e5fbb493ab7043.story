Terrifying floods which have left 11 people dead and resulted in thousands feeling their homes have left swathes of Prague under water today  -  with the deluge now moving towards Germany.

Areas to the south and north of the Czech capital were submerged, including the city's zoo and horse racing track, in the worst flooding in a decade which followed days of heavy rain. But metal barriers erected along the Vltava river banks protected the historical city centre.

Forecasters said receding rains would help water levels to drop across the Czech Republic, but that parts of Germany, Slovakia and Hungary, would be hit in the coming days.

Many rivers across the region have broken their banks and spilled across the countryside.

High water is likely to stop shipping on the Rhine in south Germany until at least Thursday morning, a state agency said.

Shipping was stopped over the weekend on 
southern sections of the river as rain caused a sharp rise in water 
level.

 residents mostly kept calm, having gained experience from a decade ago.

defences put up ... There was more water in 2002,' said Milos Sedlacek,

underground service.

It is the first time it has been 
closed since massive floods submerged the city in 2002 and caused 
billions of dollars of damage in the Czech Republic.
