A student jailed for mocking 
footballer Fabrice Muamba on Twitter after a near fatal heart attack 
could be released as early as tomorrow.

Liam Stacey, 21, sobbed as he was taken 
away in handcuffs on Tuesday after being jailed for 56 days for admitting 
inciting racial hatred.

But a High Court judge in Swansea, South 
Wales, will tomorrow hear an appeal against his sentence which could win his immediate release if 
successful.

Shame: Liam Stacey is led away in handcuffs outside Swansea Magistrates Court

The Swansea University biology student triggered revulsion after the
Premier League star’s collapse when he posted: 'LOL (laugh out loud).
F*** Muamba. He’s dead!!!'

His reviled tweet came at a time when the Bolton midfielder's plight was attracting a 
wave of sympathy around the world.

Football fans watched in horror as Muamba, 23, collapsed after suffering a heart attack during an FA Cup match on March 17.

Millions witnessed the incident at White Hart Lane as Bolton's clash with home team Tottenham Hotspur was screened live on television.

Stacey, seen arriving at the court earlier in the morning, posted a series of vile tweets about footballer Fabrice Muamba

But after a drunken Stacey received a deluge critical replies to his distasteful tweet, he responded with a torrent of racist abuse on the website.

Support for Stacey’s jail sentence was widespread on the day it was handed down, and widely debated on Twitter.

But a significant minority criticised his punishment and claimed it was politically motivated to make an example of him.

His legal team will tomorrow launch an appeal against his sentence at Swansea Crown Court.

The hearing, which is expected to last at least one hour, will go before High Court judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams.

The messages were forwarded to the police by several members of the social network, including former England striker Stan Collymore, himself a victim of abuse on Twitter.

Stacey initially claimed his account 
had been accessed by somebody else, but later pleaded guilty to racially
aggravated harassment, and was sent to prison to ‘reflect the public 
outrage’ at his comments.

As he spent his first night 
behind bars, the two teams replayed the
fixture that was called off when the midfielder came close to 
death.

Tottenham and Bolton met again at White Hart Lane, with the home team cruising to a 3-1 victory.

It means Muamba's club are now out of the FA Cup, but this hardly seemed to matter to the fans and players treating the match as a chance to pay tribute to him.

Team-mate Sam Ricketts was seen to wipe a tear from 
his eye before kick-off. It was a difficult return for the entire Bolton
squad, and manager Owen Coyle commended them for their bravery.

Players from both sides wore T-shirts
bearing messages of thanks to those who supported Muamba, while the 
whole of the Tottenham stadium erupted in applause for him.

Stacey, meanwhile, faces expulsion from 
Swansea University. The third-year biology student had hoped to become a
forensic scientist. Describing his tweets, prosecutor Louise Barron 
told the court: ‘The offence is clearly racially aggravated.

‘There was sustained and gratuitous 
racism. These were unprovoked comments and persistent abuse. The 
recipients were disgusted.’

Jailing the student at Swansea 
Magistrates’ Court, District Judge John Charles said: ‘Not just the 
footballer’s family, not just the footballing world, but the whole world
were literally praying for Muamba’s life. Your comments aggravated this
situation.

‘I have no choice but to impose an immediate custodial sentence to reflect the public outrage at what you have done.’

Applause: Everybody clapped for Muamba at the start of the match (and below)

Stacey made his comments about the 
Bolton midfielder while celebrating the Welsh 
rugby team’s Six Nations grand slam victory earlier this month.

The judge added: ‘You committed this 
offence while you were drunk and it is clear you immediately regretted 
it.

'But you must learn how to handle your alcohol better.’

Stacey, from Pontypridd, South Wales, 
told police following his arrest at his student home in Swansea: ‘I was 
at the bar when I heard what had happened to Muamba.

'I don’t know why I 
posted [the comments]. I’m not racist and some of my friends are from 
different cultural backgrounds.’

He later sent a text message to a 
friend saying: ‘I said something about Muamba that I shouldn’t have and 
tweeted back to some people who abused me.

'Getting police on me now 
which isn’t good at all.’

Another read: ‘Been bawling my eyes out on the phone to my mother for the last hour, really can’t be dealing with this.’

Gareth Jones, defending, said Stacey 
‘does not bear [Muamba] any grudge and is glad he is making a good 
recovery’.

He continued: ‘My client simply lost his head and posted 
these disgusting comments to the bitter shame of himself and his 
parents.

'For a moment of madness, his career has now gone.’ 

Upsetting: Fabrice Muamba is treated by medical staff after collapsing. Liam Stacey, 21, posted mocking tweets as the midfielder was treated on the pitch

Stacey’s
father Neale, 49, and mother Hayley, 46, were visibly shocked when the 
details of his comments were read aloud yesterday.

Jim
Brisbane, chief crown prosecutor for CPS Cymru-Wales, said: ‘Racist 
language is inappropriate in any setting and through any media.

'We hope this case will serve as a warning
to anyone who may think that comments made online are somehow beyond 
the law.’

Muamba is said to be 
continuing to make good progress at the London Chest Hospital, where he 
was visited by his Bolton team-mates ahead of their rescheduled 
match against Tottenham.

The game was abandoned on March 17 following Muamba’s collapse.
