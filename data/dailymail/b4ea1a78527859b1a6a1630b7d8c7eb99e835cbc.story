Fighter ace Squadron Leader Billy Drake's Second World War medals have sold at auction for an incredible £84,000 – triple the original estimate.

The Battle of Britain veteran shot down at least 25 enemy planes and was awarded ten medals and a bar – including a Distinguished Service Order (DSO), Distinguish Flying Cross (DFC) and bar and the American DFC for his air combat skills.

Auctioneers Bonhams expected the lot to fetch up to £30,000 when they went under the hammer today but the London-born ace's medals soared way past the estimate.

The sale helped bring the total of the lot - ‘Military Medals: The Property of a Gentleman’ - to £570,036.

Other medals under the hammer included a Distinguished Flying Cross from 1941, a 1939-1945 Star with Battle of Britain bar, and Air Crew Europe Star with France and Germany bar, an Africa Star with North Africa bar.

Sq Ldr Drake was born in 1917 to an English father and Australian mother, and was educated in Switzerland before joining the RAF before his 18th birthday.

On the outbreak of war, he saw service in the Battle of Britain, and over North Africa, Italy and Normandy.

Flying Hurricanes he had countless clashes with the Luftwaffe over the skies of France before his first enemy kill on April 19, 1940 when he downed a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter while providing air cover for the British Expeditionary Force.

When the Blitzkrieg was launched in May, Sq Ldr Drake shot down three Dornier 17s and helped destroy another in just three days.

Despite a stint in a French hospital after being forced to bail out after his Hurricane was shot up, he returned to his squadron in England and taught fighter pilots before joining 213 Squadron out of Tangmere during the Battle of Britain.

Flying a Spitfire, he helped to bring down a bomber and damaged a number of others. In December he was awarded a DFC.

He earned his silver gilt and enamel DSO in 1942 during his time as a fighter pilot in charge of 112 Squadron in North Africa where he destroyed more than 17 enemy aircrafts – including two Stuka dive bombers and two transport aircraft on the ground.

The Hurricane first flew in November 1935 and 14,533 were produced between 1937 and 1944

Sq Ldr Drake – a distant relative of Sir Francis Drake – was promoted to wing commander and posted to Malta in charge of a Spitfire wing.

His winning streak continued destroying six enemy aircrafts and picked up an American DFC in the same year for his ‘courage and audacity’ protecting USAAF bombers attacking Sicily.

Back in wartime Blighty, he commanded a Typhoon Wing and attacked German V-1 Doodlebug launch sites in Pas de Calais, and went on to become a respected instructor at the RAF Fighter Leader's School.

He ended the war behind the desk in America but on his return to the UK was made Deputy Commander at Biggin Hill and later went to HQ SHAEF to serve in the Operations Room.

He took part in the 1945 Battle of Britain flypast. He passed away on August 28, 2011, aged 93.

John Millensted, the head of the coins and medals department at Bonhams, said: ‘The medals achieved a great result and far exceeded our expectations on the day. We still owe an awful lot to the efforts of those who served in the Second World War.’
