Manchester City head into a last-day title decider, with their opponents aiming for one last twist in a remarkable Premier League season.

City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists his players will not buckle as they face West Ham at home knowing one point will clinch the title at the expense of Liverpool.

Pellegrini said: ‘I expect to win. We are thinking not of winning one point but of winning the match, and the best way to do it is to play the way we always do.

‘I am not complacent because I talk with the players every day about what we must do. They are good players with lots of  experience and they agree we must not change anything and try to win the game.’

But West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is determined to spoil City’s title party if only to fulfil his wish to see Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard win his first Premier League title.

Allardyce said: ‘From a neutral’s point of view, everybody would like to see Liverpool win it. From a personal point of view I’d like to see Steven Gerrard win it.

'City’s goal record is fantastic and they’ve got great players. But every West Ham player can give his best because we know we’re safe in the Premier League, so let’s go and spoil City’s party.’

City’s hopes have been further boosted by striker Sergio Aguero’s recovery from a groin injury.Nevertheless, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, whose side are at home to Newcastle, is determined to fight to the finish.

He said: ‘The expectancy is that Manchester City will win. But West Ham will want to finish on a high. Come Sunday, we will fight to the very end.

‘To come second to the richest team in the history of sport is an incredible achievement.’

Win or lose, Rodgers is targeting up to five quality additions to his squad. Liverpool did not sign anyone in January but they have identified a number of targets, including Adam Lallana of Southampton and Cardiff defender Steven Caulker.

Rodgers said: ‘The work has been going on for a little while now, especially since we consolidated a place in the Champions League.

‘I think we’re a really attractive proposition to players through Europe.

‘We are right on the football map.’
