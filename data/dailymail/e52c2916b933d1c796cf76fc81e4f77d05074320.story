Liverpool's summer signing Emre Can feels he is perfectly suited to the Premier League because it is full of 'big beasts' like him.

The 20-year-old signed in July after impressing for Bayer Leverkusen last season, and the German youth international feels he will have little trouble adapting to a new league

Speaking to Liverpoolfc.com, Can said: 'In the Premier League, there are a lot of 'big beasts'.

Beast: The Premier League is full of 'big beasts' according to Liverpool midfielder Emre Can

2006-9: Eintracht Frankfurt 

2009-13: Bayern Munich (four senior appearances, one goal)

2014-Present  : Liverpool

'I am also one of them, so I'm going to give my best. 

'The Premier League style suits me; to be a physical and strong player is important and I am looking forward to putting that to good use.'

But if Liverpool fans should not expect Can to purely work as a physical enforcer. 

The defensive midfielder claimed his style is perfectly suited to his new manager's principles.

'The Brendan Rodgers style suits me, and I can adapt to it quickly,'

Style: Can said he feels as though both the Premier League and Liverpool play a style that will suit him

'He wants to play football and that's what I do. I am here to play so I hope to be ready to feature quickly.'

Can began his career at Eintracht Frankfurt before moving to Bayern Munich. But after failing to break into the first team he signed a four-year deal with Bayer Leverkusen.

Now Can finds himself in England, and preparing to take on the champions. But Manchester City hold no fears for the German, who says his side will approach the clash with confidence. 

Bundesliga: After failing to break in to Bayern Munich's team, Can proved himself at Bayer Leverkusen

'I am looking forward to this match, last season's first against second,' he said.

'I'm sure it will be a big match. We won the first match and to win the second is also important.

'I think all of our players can go into that second match confidently, having won our first match. We all have a great deal of self-belief and we can go into that match to win it.'

Confidence: The Under 21 international said his team will face Manchester City full of confidence
