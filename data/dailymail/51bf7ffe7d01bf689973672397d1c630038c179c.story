A former Australian Survivor contestant who tried to murder his ex-girlfriend so the couple could 'be together for eternity' has lost an appeal in the NSW supreme court.

Joel Betts will spend at least 11 years behind bars and could be in jail for up to 16 years after his 2012 sentence for stabbing Samantha Holland was upheld on Tuesday morning.

During sentencing for the 2010 attack, which happened at the couple's Chippendale apartment in Sydney's inner-city, Judge Robert Toner said Betts intended to kill the 24-year-old because he couldn't persuade her to reunite with him.

While stabbing Ms Holland 26 times, Betts told her: 'I want us to die together so we can be together for eternity.'

Betts pleaded guilty to the attempted murder in February 2012.

Judge Toner found that 'profound jealousy' had motivated Betts to try and kill Ms Holland as she went to leave their home unit.

She had gone there to collect her belongings after ending the relationship. 

He had promised he would not be home but he was and tried to persuade Ms Holland to resume the relationship.

She refused, telling him 'I'm done', and tried to leave.

As she turned towards the door, Betts stabbed her in the back and also stabbed himself in an attempted suicide.

Ms Holland tried several times to escape. 

In one attempt she told Betts to hand her the knife if he wanted them to die together in 'the Romeo and Juliet love scenario he had in mind'.

After a 45-minute ordeal, she stabbed Betts in the stomach and jumped onto a neighbour's balcony in blood-soaked underwear.

Ms Holland testified during the trial she still struggled to understand 'how someone who professed to love me was the one who wanted to cause the most harm'.

'I was stabbed, detained and forced to jump from a third-floor balcony to save my life... I had no intention of dying,' she said.
