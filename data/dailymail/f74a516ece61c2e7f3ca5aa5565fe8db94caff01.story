Stores using larger sized mannequins have been accused of 'normalising' Britain's obesity crisis, according to a report by England's chief medical officer.

Dame Sally Davies has warned that larger mannequins are making people think being overweight is acceptable.

She also said that many people do not 
recognise they have a weight problem, with data showing that 52 per cent 
of overweight men and 30 per cent of overweight women think they are the right weight.

Larger mannequins are being blamed for undermining the nation's obesity crisis. Mr Miller, who has eight years experience helping people lose weight, blamed 'political correctness for keeping people fat', claiming society need to use shock tactics to tackle the problem

Dame Davies blamed larger 
mannequins, combined with retailers' recent tendency to carry out 'size 
inflation' with clothes - when clothes with the same size label become larger - for undermining the health risks that come with 
obesity.

The fashion industry has long been accused of presenting 'underweight' as an ideal goal.

However, Dame Davies believes that in a recent trend, society has been complicit in normalising being 'overweight'.

She said: 'Larger mannequins are being introduced into clothes shops.

'"Size inflation" means that clothes with the same size label have become larger in recent decades.

'News stories about overweight (issues) often feature pictures of severely obese people, which are under-representative of the overweight population.'

While the average woman is a size 16, most clothes stores in Britain use mannequins that are between size 8 and 10.

Debenhams was the first department store to start using size 16 mannequins, in a push to try and get all high street stores to display larger models.

Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies says being overweight has been 'normalised' by society and even suggested a sugar tax to improve people's diets

Many stores did not follow suit, with Marks & Spencer saying they took a 'responsible approach to visual merchandising'.

The issue of mannequins was a subject touched upon in Dame Davies' larger warning on the British obesity crisis.

She presented data that said around 11 
per cent of obese men and 6 per cent of obese women think they are the 
right weight, while 77 per cent of parents of overweight children do not
 recognise their child is heavier than they should be.

Equalities Minister Jo Swinson backed Debenham's launch of size 16 mannequins

Estimates suggest that almost two thirds of adults and one third of children under 18 are obese or overweight - around 33 million adults and 3 million children.

Around 25 per cent of adults in the UK are obese, compared with only 7 per cent of adults in 1980, an increase of 18 per cent over the last three decades.

Dame Davies also claimed that habits like watching TV and a lack of exercise were on the increase

In her report, Dame Davies also suggested a radical 'sugar tax'.

She said adults and children consumed too much, with a third of added sugar in the diet of children aged between 11 and 18 coming from fizzy drinks, smoothies and fruit juices.

She said: 'This is an alarming proportion.

'Soft drinks are easily avoidable sources of added sugar.

'I call on manufacturers to ramp up reformulation of products to use less sugar.

'If voluntary efforts fail to deliver then we, as a society, may need to consider the public health benefits that could be derived from regulation such as a "sugar tax".'

Dame Davies' report also pointed out that research found that adults watched an average of 1,648 minutes (27.5 hours) of television per week in 2013.

Dame Davies also spoke about the effects of alcohol on obesity, and suggested that changes to the Budget, such as a penny off a pint of beer, could encourage drinking.

This increased drinking could lead to rapid weight gain in the UK.

She said: 'Once I discovered the calories in alcohol, as well as the bad side effects, I drank much less,' she told BBC Radio 4.

'I worry that people will drink more 
but in fact at the moment alcohol consumption has not recently gone up, 
probably because of austerity.'

'People also needed to be made more aware that fruit juice was not a healthy option in large quantities,' she said.

'When
 I used to sit in my clinic, mothers would bring their children in 
drinking vast amounts of orange juice and they thought this was healthy.

A cut in the tax on alcohol in the latest Budget could mean an increase in drinking, which, considering how it is very calorific, could cause an increase obesity

She also used her study to call for more research into a potential link between deafness and blindness and dementia.

Data suggested a greater prevalence of dementia, including Alzheimerâ€™s disease, in those with severe vision loss or severe hearing impairment.

She also said England should explore the impact of minimum unit pricing for alcohol if Scotland introduced it.
