Real Madrid can win their 10th consecutive Champions League game on Wednesday night in Gelsenkirchen equaling the competition record held by Bayern Munich. 

But to do so they must dismantle the wall Roberto di Matteo has waiting for them at the Veltins Arena.

After a miserable run of form since the turn of the year that has seen them lose to both Valencia and Atletico Madrid in the league and get knocked out of the Copa del Rey, Real will be glad to be back in the competition that made them record breakers last season becoming the first team to win it 10 times.

And the prospect of reaching double figures in straight wins too, will only add to that. 

But they face a coach determined to ruin their quest to become the first team to retain the Champions League.

Di Matteo, who won the competition with Chelsea thanks in no small part to heroic defensive displays against Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona in the semi-finals and Jupp Heynckes’ Bayern in the final in 2012, will string five across the back and tell Cristiano Ronaldo and company - give us your best shot.

‘He’s only human’ Di Matteo said on the eve of the game when asked about a run of form that has seen him score just four times in his last 10 games. 

Schalke: Wellenreuther; Uchida, Höwedes, Matip, Nastasic, Fuchs; Höger, Kirchihof, Boateng; Choupo-Moting, Huntelaar 

Real Madrid: Casillas; Carvajal, Pepe, Varane, Marcelo; Silva, Kroos, Isco; Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo

Ronaldo is back at the scene of last season’s 6-1 Real Madrid win when the team that went on to win the competition really clicked into gear for the first time.

Two goals each from Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Ronaldo earned Madrid that big win 12 months ago. 

It was the first sign of the potential of the trio that went on to lead Real to a 5-0 aggregate win over Bayern Munich in the semi-finals and a 4-1 win over Atletico Madrid in the final.

The BBC of Benzema, Bale and Cristiano will all start on Wednesday night, but there is a very different look to the Madrid midfield that will play behind them compared to the one that helped destroy Schalke 12 months ago. Angel Di Maria, Luka Modric and Xabi Alonso played then. 

With Modric still a month away from fitness and Alonso and Di Maria sold, Toni Kroos will play between Lucas Silva and Isco.

Kroos has played 2,995 minutes so far this season, more than any other Real Madrid player, and for Silva it would be his full debut.

Defensively too there are problems with Sergio Ramos sidelined and Pepe only just back from injury – making his return 32 days after sustaining a rib injury against Atletico Madrid. 

The Portuguese was sorely missed in the 4-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid in the league 10 days ago and will partner Rafael Varane.

Behind them Iker Casillas makes his 150th European appearance and will be glad to be far from those who whistled him at the Santiago Bernabeu at the weekend. 

The boo-boys have no doubt forgotten that it was his brilliant save last season at the Veltins Arena when the score was 1-0 to Real Madrid that paved the way for the 6-1 victory.

His opposite number tonight will be Timon Wellenreuther a 19-year-old keeper who plays because first choice keeper Ralf Fährmann is injured.

Ahead of him the teenager will have the massed ranks of a very experienced defence that includes Benedikt Howedes who won the World Cup with Germany at left-back last summer; was given a torrid time at right-back by Ronaldo in this fixture last season; but who is much happier in a three-man central defence. 

He is joined by Manchester City loanee Matija Nastasic and Cameroon international Joel Matip.

In attack Eric Choupo-Moting and Kevin Prince Boateng will carry a threat on the break and former Real Madrid forward Klass-Jan Huntelaar will be looking to punish his old club.

Di Matteo has unhappy memories of his only previous meeting as a coach with Carlo Ancelotti. 

Back in 2010 his West Brom team were beaten 6-0 by Carlo’s Chelsea. His newly-promoted Baggies team were lambs to the slaughter five years ago just as Schalke were last year. 

This time there is a sense, at least among Schalke supporters who have already seen their team hold Bayern this season and move up to fourth place, that things will be different.
