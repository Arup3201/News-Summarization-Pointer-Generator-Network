A dentist who amassed Britain’s biggest private car collection has sold the entire £100million fleet to Jaguar Land Rover.

Dr James Hull, 53, spent tens of millions of pounds filling a number of warehouses in Hertfordshire with classic motors from the past 80 years.

His impressive collection consists of 543 cars - ranging from multi-million pound Jaguars and Bentleys to Morris Minors.

It also includes Lord Mountbatten’s Mini Traveller, Winston Churchill’s Austin and a Bentley owned by singer Elton John.

'We
 look forward to continuing to work with James going forward as we 
develop our heritage activities. Heritage is becoming an ever more 
important differentiating factor when it comes to experiential customer 
marketing and in developing our brands in new and emerging markets.

'Jaguar and Land Rover have a combined "back catalogue" of over 140 years to draw upon and some of the most iconic vehicles in the industry.

'In addition with the explosive growth and interest in classic car events worldwide and the increase in the size and value of the market, there is a strong brand and business rationale underpinning this agreement.'

Dr Hull, who sold the collection because of health issues, today described Jaguar Land Rover as the perfect custodians for the fleet.

Soft-top: Travelling all over the world to build the collection over the years has been a labour of love and a life¿s work, so my primary motivation was not to get the maximum price but rather to secure the future of the collection in this country with the right custodian,' said Dr Hull.

'Travelling all over the world to build the collection over the years has been a labour of love and a life’s work, so my primary motivation was not to get the maximum price but rather to secure the future of the collection in this country with the right custodian,' he said.

'I have got to know Jaguar Land Rover well in recent years and they have borrowed cars from the collection for events such as the Mille Miglia and supporting Jaguar in China.

'They are the perfect custodians to take the collection forward and I know it is in safe hands.'

Dr Hull's stunning collection also includes a Humber which was owned by the judge presiding over the Profumo Affair and a 1961 Jaguar E-Type, which belonged to Britain’s world motorcycle champion Mike Hailwood.

In 2006, he was left devastated when vandals broke into a warehouse housing a number of them, before hotwiring the Jaguars and crashing them.

At the time, police said the criminals had 'treated the cars like dodgems'.
