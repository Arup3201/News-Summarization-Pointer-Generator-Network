A mysterious golden crown crafted by
South American tribesmen and presented to Queen Victoria is among the royal
treasures to go on show to mark the Diamond Jubilee.

The crown, given to Victoria by the
president of Ecuador, Gabriel Garcia Moreno, in 1862, has a distinctive plume and was excavated in the
south of the country in 1854.

Its origins remain a source of
controversy among archaeologists, who have disputed whether it is an Inca
treasure or an object crafted by the minority Canari group, who resisted the
armies of the Inca tribe until the 15th century.

Dr Colin McEwan, a curator at the
British Museum, said: 'It's a little bit of a detective story, and we have only
one part of the jigsaw puzzle.

'The plumes raise the question of
whether it was commissioned by the Incas, and provide valuable clues to the
relationship between the Inca and the Canaris.

'The Treasures exhibition has opened up
a whole new avenue to reassess the crown and its context - that's where objects
start to come alive again - through the combination of scientific and
collections research.'

One hundred items from the Royal
Collection go on show to the public in The Queen's Gallery in the Palace of
Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh from Friday, March 16, until November.

Most of the treasures have not been
displayed in Scotland before.

The exhibition showcases five centuries
of collecting from nine royal residences, and includes artwork by Italian
masters Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, Dutch artist Rembrandt, and Flemish
artist Peter Paul Rubens.

Two Faberge Easter eggs made for the
Russian Imperial family also feature among 20 such eggs in the collection.

Royal jewellery is well represented,
with a gold locket encrusted with diamonds and rubies containing a lock of
Charles I's hair, dating from around 1620, one of the highlights.

Pendants owned by Mary, Queen of Scots,
and Queen Victoria, and an emerald-encrusted belt belonging to 19th century
Sikh ruler Maharaja Sher Singh also feature.

Two cameos, portraits in profile set on
to a pendant, are of particular interest, one of Zeus dating from 1-2 AD, and
the other of the Roman Emperor Claudius from 43-45 AD - both of which are
considered some of the finest surviving examples of their kind.

Hunters and gatherers are first believed to have settled in South American Ecuador around 10,000BC.

And by 500BC, cities had begun to take shape along the coastline.

The Inca were a dynamic people who built a great empire dominating Peru and reaching as far as Bolivia and Chile.

In 1460 AD, the Inca ruler Tupac 
Yupanqui invaded Ecuador from the south - and the Canari tribe (along 
with Quitu and Caras) managed to repel his forces.

However, their resistance proved less effective against Tupac's son, Huayna Cpac.

The Canari were said to be a matriarchal society - and by marrying their women, the Incas were able to subjugate them.

After conquering Ecuador, Huayna Capac
indoctrinated the tribes to Quechua, the language of the Incas, which 
is still widely spoken in Ecuador. He died in 1526.
