A retired British Royal Air Force Wing Commander died when he lost control of his replica First World War biplane and plummeted into a field.

Brian North, MBE, 72, who was living in Colorado, USA, had assembled the two-thirds size SE5A aircraft himself after having the parts shipped out from England.

He had completed the plane in October and had been flying it for about a month before the crash around a mile from Front Range Airport near Denver.

According to the Denver Post newspaper Mr North
called the control tower and got clearance to perform a 'touch-and-go' 
landing.

He then made a series of right turns until he was approaching the 
runway but suddenly called the control tower again and in a garbled transmission requested a 'full-stop' landing.

The plane then plummeted to the ground and burst into flames about a mile north of the runway.

Mr North had been a wing commander of 
the Royal Air Force and was a member of the Most Excellent Order of the 
British Empire

Dennis Heap, executive director of the airport, said: 'It was an absolutely beautiful day, there was no problem with the weather, it had to be something between man and machine.

'He was flying in a pattern one moment and down on the ground — crashed — the next moment,' Heap said.

'Mr North was well-known to us, an integral part of the airport community.

'It's unfortunate, but often distinguished people live among us and we don't know it until they die," he said.

Mr Heap said the garbled transmission could indicate electrical failure caused the crash but the National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA will investigate the cause of the crash to make sure.

A friend of Mr North's Michael Buehner-Coldrey, 67, who is also ex-RAF and had flown the plane a number of times, including on its maiden flight, said: 'I helped him take off for the half-hour flight and was due to take the plane out later.

'It was in perfect flying order, and going beautifully, which makes it all the sadder. It's a mystery what must have happened.'

Mr Buehner-Coldrey, who lives in Aurora, Colorado, added: 'Brian was a very good friend of mine, a clever guy, good with his hands.

'He left school at 15 and had a 35-year career in the RAF. He did an apprenticeship at RAF Halton near Aylesbury, and went on to become a wing commander, specialising in engineering, and travelled around working on Harriers.

'He received the MBE from the Queen for his services, and not many people have that.

'After retiring from the RAF, he worked for 10 years as an immigration officer at Heathrow.

'Three or four years ago he and his wife, Adrienne, who celebrated their 50th anniversary this year, moved out here from the UK to help his daughter, who is married with kids. They also have a son in the UK.

'He was a very dedicated family man, and very modest, with a dry sense of humour.'
