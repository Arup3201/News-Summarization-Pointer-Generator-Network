There are some moments when you just wish the ground would open up and swallow you - especially when you're a bloke trying to sneak out of a Fifty Shades of Grey screening. 

Just when he thought he'd got away with catching a sneaky peak at the raunchy new flick this not-so-secret fan walked straight into a TV camera.

Local broadcaster TV2/Nord was filming an interview with a female film goer at the premiere of the film in Aalborg, Denmark.

The now not-so-secret Fifty Shades fan turns around and heads back, perhaps hoping to find another exit

The man takes a look back over his shoulder at the camera, looking for all the world like a guilty schoolboy

In the cringeworthy 22-second clip a middle aged man appears in the background on his way out of the cinema but as soon as he realises he's being filmed he stops in his tracks.

After an excruciating moment of indecision the man, who appears to have been to the screening on his own, turns around and heads back down the corridor, taking a sneaky peak back over his shoulder at the camera like a guilty schoolboy. 

Perhaps hoping to find a different exit he soon realises he's got nowhere else to go and makes another embarrassing about face and, head down, shuffles past the camera as quickly as he can second time around.

Ironically the female interviewer and the TV reporter have just got on to discussing why men have been staying away from Fifty Shades as the hapless man finally makes his escape.  

Realizing he's got nowhere to go he turns around again as it's clear the crew won't be packing up and leaving

Head down, he prepares to face the music and make the getaway he might have done the first time round

Just as the man walks past, the interviewee is asked just why it is men have been avoiding the film 

The long-awaited flick, panned as dull 'housewife porn' by critics, is largely drawing female audiences in Denmark.

The painfully awkward 22-second clip has been seen more than 1.7million times and racked up more than 2,000 comments on YouTube, mostly poking fun at the unfortunate man's embarrassment.

'That guy knows he just got his man card revoked… permanently,' read one comment.

Another said: 'This man has balls of steel to go into this movie'. 

Others came to the Aalborg man's defence.

'Nothing wrong with this man watching Fifty Shades of Grey. Men are not supposed to be conventionalized by archaic gender roles. People are individuals, not herds of cattle,' wrote one viewer.

Another added: 'Why does it matter if a man saw it? Just because a man sees a feminine movie, it doesn't make him weak, any less of a man, or a pervert.'
