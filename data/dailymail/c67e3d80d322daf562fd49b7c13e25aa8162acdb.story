With her grey hair, moustache and unusual looks, she's not your typical star.

But this cat has already become a celebrity after she was made the star of an advert that has already gone viral.

The mustachioed cat storming the internet as the star of the new ad for mobile phone company Three has been revealed as seven-month-old kitty Simcris Bronte Bronjoy - or Bronte for short.

The star of the show is an adorable seven-month-old cat called Bronte, who lives with her owners Caroline and Lyndon Bailey

The Sing it Kitty ad has been viewed millions of times online after being launched just a few days ago

Bronte's unusual looks have caused thousands of fans to believe the cat is completely computer generated. But the star of the show is the real deal

The advert shows the exotic short-hair cat being paraded around a suburban street in a bicycle basket as the side-kick of an adventurous five-year-old girl - while they both sing to Starship's 1985 hit We Built This City.

The ad has been viewed millions of times online after being launched just a few days ago - and Bronte's unusual looks have caused thousands of fans to believe the cat is completely computer generated.

But the star of the show is the real deal - and living in Rugby, Warwickshire, with her owners Caroline and Lyndon Bailey.

Bronte was only three months old when the advert was shot and producers wanted a small kitten to fit in the pink bicycle's tiny basket.

Owners Caroline and Lyndon were shocked when the television company rang wanting to make their pet a star.

Caroline, 50, said: 'It's such a surreal situation.

'We got a call from an agency saying they wanted a short haired exotic but didn't explain what they wanted her for.

'They must have seen lots of cats but the moment they saw Bronte they said they knew she was the one.

'It's just like winning the lottery, there are thousands of cats and kittens in Britain - it just so happens that Bronte is special - I always knew she was a star.

As soon as the posing kitty was cast Bronte had a specialised cat trainer flown in from LA to teach her to ride in the basket and look into the camera.

The filming involved five days on location and Bronte had a personal vet to tend to her feline well-being.

Caroline said: 'Apart from the singing the cat is all Bronte - we trained her to sit in the basket, to bob down and jump back up - she was incredible.

'Bronte loves the attention, she adores the camera and is such a diva, she always wants to be the centre of attention.

'At home she's just a loved pet, we have four cats and two dogs so she has to share the lime-light.'

The too-cute to be real cat was teamed in pur-fect harmony with five-year-old child model Jolie Forrest.

Caroline said: 'They were the perfect duo and loved working together.

'It's such a great advert - I'm so happy that Bronte is making people smile all over the world.'
