A friend of the late Benihana founder Rocky Aioki has claimed his third wife Keiko 'nursed, fed and tended to' her husband ahead of his death, while his children were nowhere to be found.

The news comes after Keiko Ono Aoki's lawyer Richard Feldman countersued on her behalf Monday in the latest installment of a bitter feud over his $35million fortune.

Court papers accuse Aoki's six children, including model Devon Aoki, of swindling a 'deathbed distribution' worth millions out of the restauranteur the day before he passed away in 2008.

But the children claim it's allowable for their father to distribute them income during his lifetime.

They already received $7 million from 
insurance before appearing at the hospital in Aoki's last hours to ask 
for another $3 million.

In the New York Post's Page Six, Cindy Adams, who says she was a close friend of Aioki's from the start of his successful 
teppanyaki business, says Keiko was there for her husband until the end,
 while his children weren't around.

'In his fragility, no kids were around. Keiko nursed, fed, tended him. I saw it,' Adams writes.

She said Keiko also tried to settle 
the children's lawsuits but they refused.

So she decided to sue the siblings and their respective lawyers.

She
 only gained control of the $35 million estate last year, and her late 
husband's children claim the money was from a trust she had no rights 
over, according to an earlier report in the New York Post.

In documents, Keiko claims Devon, her DJ brother Steve Aoki, and their four siblings looted the cash from their ailing father July 9, 2008 as he 'lay dying in his hospital bed.'

Rocky Aoki realized the American dream with his vast empire of teppanyaki restaurants where food is theatrically grilled at the same table diners eat at. He set up a trust for his children 10 years prior to his death after being convicted of insider trading.

The former Japanese Olympic wrestling 
qualifier named sons Kevin and Kyle, daughter Kana Grace and close 
friend Kenneth Podziba trustees – Keiko Ono Aoki was not named.

Trusts grant trustees the right to distribute funds at their discretion – which happened to be the eve of their patriarch's death.

'Keiko had no more right to notice [of the money transfer] than did Rocky's doctors or chauffeur, as she is not a named beneficiary,' a court filing cited by the Post claims.

The pair married in 2002 without a prenuptial agreement.

The 
founder had previously sued his children over the attempts to wrestle 
control over his steakhouse empire from him after he had children by at 
least three different women, according to New York magazine.

The money was handed out at that time because two of his children were 'in dire need' of cash, a source told the paper. The funds were distributed equally among the six children.

Daughter Devon, known for movie roles
 such as 'Sin City' and walking runways all over the world, and son 
Steve, a DJ who tours the world and has permanent residence in a Las 
Vegas nightclub, were not likely among those who needed cash - but they 
still received their cuts.

Keiko Ono Aoki is now CEO of Benihana and has overseen expansion to 100 locations around the world, according to the company's website.

Her
 late husband qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome but did not
 compete, instead choosing to barnstorm around the United States where 
he went undefeated.

Rocky leveraged the fame garnered from three consecutive national championships to open the first Benihana in 1964 in Midtown Manhattan.

He died of pneumonia the day following the cash grab.

Podziba declined to comment when reached by the Post, the attorney for Keiko told the paper the dispute was 'not uncommon.'
