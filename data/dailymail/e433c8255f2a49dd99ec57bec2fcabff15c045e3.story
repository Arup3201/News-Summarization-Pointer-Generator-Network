The Texas college student killed during a traffic stop last Friday, was charging at the campus officer when he was shot at six times, police say.

In a press conference Monday afternoon, Chief Richard Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department said 23-year-old student Robert Cameron Redus had wrestled Cpt Chris Carter's baton away from him and hit the policeman in the head and arm with it.

Cpt Carter eventually got the baton back and told Redus four times to stop fighting him or he would shoot.

That's when Redus turned around and charged at Carter with his arm raised to strike, and Cpt Carter took out his .40-calibur semiautomatic gun and shot six times at Redus, hitting him five times in the chest, neck, eye, arm and thigh.

While the camera on the police cruiser 
was out, audio was still working which captured Carter warning Redus 56 
times to stop resisting arrest, 14 times to place his hands behind his back and three times that he was under arrest. The incident is still under investigation.

Investigation: Police say Cameron Redus, 23, was charging at a campus police officer when he was shot

Under investigation: The parking lot of Redus' apartment block where he died is cordoned off by police

Scuffle: Witnesses heard a short exchange between Cameron and the officer before shots were fired

Cpt Carter pulled the student over not far from campus in Alamo Heights because he was speeding and 'driving erratically,' according to police.

Alamo Heights Police Lieutenant Cindy Pruitt told KSAT
 that the incident occurred about 2am in the parking lot of the Treehouse apartments in the 100 block of Grandview Place off Broadway, where
 Redus was a resident.

Redus, known to friends by his second name Cameron, had spent the evening celebrating the end of semester with classmates.

It
 is not clear where Carter first tried to pull Redus over, but both 
vehicles drove north on Broadway until they pulled into the parking lot 
of the Treehouse Apartments where the struggle ensued. Pruitt told My San Antonio that Carter radioed for help shortly before Redus was shot.

Cameron had been celebrating the end of semester with friends before he was shot

A witness who lives in the Treehouse Apartments described hearing 'five or six' gunshots, but no verbal warnings.

'I
 didn't hear him say anything like, "Get down on your hands and knees," 
you know? I didn't hear him say anything. He just started shooting,' the
 man told KSAT.

'He emptied the gun on him,' he said. 'Boom, boom, boom.'

Mohammad Haidarasl lives directly below Redus at the Treehouse Apartments.

He told My San Antonio that he was asleep on his sofa when he heard an exchange between Redus and Carter.

'I heard [a man] say, "Oh, you're gonna shoot me?" like sarcastic almost,' he said.

Less
 than a minute later, Mr Haidarasl heard four to six gunshots. He only 
realized the man who had been shot was his upstairs neighbor, whom 
Haidrasl described as 'the nicest guy.'

Officers investigating the incident haven't attempted to contact Haidrasl about what he heard, Haidrasl told My San Antonio.

Not aggressive: Cameron Redus' friends and family can't understand how someone as gentle and kind as him could have been shot by a police officer

The officer, who has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the shooting investigation, has an 'extensive law enforcement background' according to the university.

However, part of the background involves jumping from job-to-job on a regular basis, according to employment records obtained by the San Antonio Express-News.

Cpt Carter has had nine jobs at eight different agencies over his eight-year law enforcement career.

He rarely stayed in any job for more than a year and the two years and seven months as a campus officer for UIW was the longest stint in his career.

KVUE-TV reports that Cpt Carter has told investigators he feared for his life.

But the story of Redus as the aggressor doesn't ring true to the people who knew the Incarnate Word senior.

'He was just not that type of person,' his peer, 20-year-old Miriam Thomas, told My San Antonio. 'Everyone has been completely heartbroken over this.'

More than 200 people - including Redus' 
mother and father - turned out a vigil Sunday to mourn the UIW student 
and remember his short life.

'We are understandably devastated by 
the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal
 with our tragic loss,' his family said in a statement.

'We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time.'

Several of Redus' friends spoke to the media.

Memories: The ceremony included many remembrances from friends in the UIW community. A candlelight vigil was also held on campus at the Lourdes Grotto. Redus' brother and mother can be seen on the right of the picture

Kyle Leihsing, a San Antonio native had been friends with Redus for three years.

'He was one of the most level-headed people I've ever met. What I have heard is completely counter-intuitive to what I have known him to be,' he said.

'There's just an outpouring of genuine grief among hundreds, if not thousands, of people in our community because he was so well-liked and loved,' Annie Jones, a friend of Redus, told KENS 5.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the student and officer involved in this incident,' UIW President Dr Lou Agnese said.

Redus had moved to San Antonio from Baytown for school. He went to Baytown Christian Academy and graduated as co-valedictorian.

His academic success continued at 
UIW, where he had been named to the Dean's List and was a part-time 
anchor for the school's student newscast.

'I
 grieve on behalf of his parents, because I know how devastated they 
are. He was a sweet, sweet person,' said family friend Annie Jones.

Doubts: Mickey Redus, pictured at his son's vigil, says he has doubts about the police account of the shooting

Back in Redus' hometown of Baytown, the promising student's mother, father, brothers and friends are struggling to understand their loss.

Redus old friends from high school were shocked to hear the news.

'He was so kind. He’s not an aggressive person at all,' friend Sara Davis told KHOU. 'The story doesn’t really make sense to any of us.'

A vigil has been set for 7pm on Saturday at the University of the Incarnate Word grotto.

According to ABC, Redus' family has hired an attorney.
