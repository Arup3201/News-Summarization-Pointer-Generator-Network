Patrick Vieira's youngsters got their Barclays U21 Premier League season off to a losing start after a red card, an own goal and a 92nd-minute strike from substitute Charly Musonda won Chelsea the match.

Manchester City's Elite Development Squad could do little to prevent the 2-1 defeat on Friday night after Shay Facey was sent off for two bookable offences, leaving Chelsea with 10 minutes to attack.

Chelsea Youth Team manager Adi Viveash will leave Aldershot sensing fortune was  on his side, while City right-back Pablo Maffeo will return north feeling the opposite.

A goal from Maffeo just two minutes in - his first at U21 level - got City en route to  three points, only for the Spaniard to find his own net and gift Chelsea an equaliser 13 minutes from time.

It was a melee in the box that allowed Maffeo to capitalise for his opener, before a tricky cross from Chelsea's Alex Kiwomya caused problems for the 17-year-old who, in truth, didn't deserve such rotten luck.

It got worse for City as, four minutes later, they were reduced to 10 men with Facey the culprit receiving two yellow cards.

Persistent: Chelsea's Charly Musonda celebrates scoring the 92nd-minute winner against Manchester City

Chelsea Youth Team manager Adi Viveash talked to their official website afterwards.

'It was a really tough game against a really strong, physical team. They caused us problems but the game was everything I expected it to be,' he said.

‘It was nice for Charly to score because it was a difficult decision for me to leave him out. He’s had an outstanding pre-season, scoring and creating goals, and he was unlucky to miss out tonight but he responded in the perfect way.’

Facey's first came in the 56th minute for holding back Kiwomya, before he committed the same foul on Dominic Solanke less than half an hour later to be sent for an early shower in the Aldershot changing rooms.

Chelsea sensed the win was within reach, and their persistence paid off.

Kiwomya, a thorn in City's side all evening, burst down the right and a deflected cross fell kindly to substitute Musonda, whose low shot found the bottom corner. 

It was too little, too late for City to muster a comeback, and the U21 Premier League season started with advantage Viveash over Vieira.
