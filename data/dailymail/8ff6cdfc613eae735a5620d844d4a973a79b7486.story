A new study is set to reveal how personality impacts the commenting behaviour of people reading online news websites.

The research will examine why readers choose to comment on news stories and which personalities are likely to take part in aggressive 'keyboard warrior' discussions or trolling behaviour.

Previous studies show commenters on general websites are extroverts, narcissistic and conscientious and the new study hopes to reveal whether these personality traits are more common on news websites.

The University of the Sunshine Coast study, led by journalism lecturer Dr Renee Barnes and psychologist Professor Doug Mahar in Queensland's southeast, will examine which readers are more likely to leave repeated comments or engage with other users.

Dr Barnes said the main aim of the research is to identify which comments are linked to extroverts or anonymous individuals.

The lecturer said there are a number of factors which may prompt people to comment on news stories.

'People who aren't frequent commenters, when they do comment it is because there's something particular in the story that really resonates with them,' she told the ABC 

'They might feel they have personal information on that story, or some sort of expertise.'

Dr Barnes added that the reader's relationship with a journalist may also influence their comments while others will post their views simply because they agree or disagree with others.

This follows previous research which revealed commenters on general websites have personality traits which include extraversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness and narcissism.

Professor Mahar said the new survey will determine whether the similar traits were more common on news websites as opposed to others sites.

Dr Barnes said in the second part of the survey, people will be asked to provide information such as their usernames and which websites they frequently post comments on.

'Then we are going to go and look at their comments so we can match that up with how they're testing in their personality,' she said.
