Five men have been arrested following the death of a man who was found badly injured in a house.

They discovered an injured man and shortly afterwards paramedics confirmed the man had died.

Five men, aged between 28 and 57, were arrested at the address on suspicion of murder, and remain in police custody, a Staffordshire Police spokeswoman said.

They are a 28-year-old of no fixed abode, a 43-year-old from Newcastle-under-Lyme, a 56-year-old from Newcastle-under-Lyme, a 57-year-old of no fixed abode and a 58-year-old from Newcastle-under-Lyme.

Detectives are working to establish the circumstances which led to the death of the man.

Chief Inspector Jon Staite said: 'This type of incident is rare in Staffordshire and is being thoroughly investigated by the force's Major Investigation Department.

'We are grateful for the patience and understanding of the local community at this time whilst we carry out a detailed examination of the scene.

'Uniformed officers will remain in the area in the coming days to offer reassurance to local residents.'

The man has yet to be formally identified and a post-mortem examination is due to be carried out by a Home Office pathologist.

The house has been cordoned off for a full examination by forensic investigators.

Anyone with any information should contact Staffordshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
