Shooting: The policeman who shot Mark Duggan (pictured) as he got out of a minicab with a loaded gun said he thought the 29-year-old was about to shoot him or one of his colleagues

The police marksman who killed Mark Duggan told a court yesterday he was ‘absolutely 100 per cent’ sure the suspect was holding a gun.

In his first public account of the shooting, the firearms officer described his ‘Oh f*** moment’ when he feared he was about to be shot himself.

The policeman told the jury how he shot Duggan twice as the suspect appeared to aim his gun at officers who had stopped him.

The death of Duggan, 29, in Tottenham on August 4 last year triggered the riots that swept across the country in the following days.

His family and friends claim he was unarmed and have demanded ‘Justice for Mark’.

However the officer, known as V53, said he had an ‘honestly held belief’ that Duggan – who had been under surveillance – was going to shoot.

The marksman, from the Met’s specialist armed police unit CO19, told the court: ‘The only way I can describe this is as an “Oh f*** moment”.

'He’s got a gun and he’s going to use it on me.

‘He was holding the pistol-grip of the gun. I could make out the shape, the outline, of the gun.

‘I could make out the trigger-guard and the barrel. I saw him hold the gun in his right-hand side on to his stomach.

'He then began to move the barrel away from his body.

‘I perceived this as being the beginning of him raising the gun into an aim position whereby he would shoot me or one of my colleagues.’

The firearms officer gave his account of the shooting at the trial of Kevin Hutchinson-Foster in Snaresbrook Crown Court yesterday.

Hutchinson-Foster, 30, is accused of handing Duggan a gun just 15 minutes before he was killed.

He denies the charge.

Weapon: Kevin Hutchinson-Foster is on trial accused of handing Mr Duggan the gun before he was killed

The court heard how a team of 12 armed
officers in three unmarked cars were following a Toyota people- carrier
taxi that Duggan was inside.

After being ordered to ‘strike, strike, 
strike’, the officers brought the taxi to a sudden halt.

The shooter told the court that he and another officer shouted warnings of ‘armed police’ at those inside the car.

‘Mark Duggan got out of the vehicle at
pace,’ he said.

‘He had a spring in his step, which to me indicated he 
was about to run or possibly fight his way out of the situation he had 
found himself in.

‘As I have shouted “armed police” Mark
Duggan has turned to face me. I perceived this as him looking for 
another avenue to escape.

Flashpoint: Mr Duggan's death on August 4 last year sparked riots which started in Tottenham (above) and spread across the capital and the country

Gun: Prosecutors allege Mr Duggan collected the weapon from Mr Hutchinson-Foster in Leyton, east London, before continuing to Tottenham (above), where the riots later broke out

‘At that time he was blocked by the 
minicab to his front, he was blocked by W42 [another armed officer] to 
the side, and he was blocked by a 5ft metal fence.

‘The only avenue of escape for him would have been behind him, or where I was standing.’

The officer fired one round at the suspect, which hit him on the right side of his chest.

He added: ‘The gun was still in his 
hand. I have seen the round impact on his right chest and he has done a 
flinching movement as it’s impacted on him.

'I have reassessed and the 
gun he is carrying was pointing in my direction now.

I think he is going
to shoot me or my colleagues and I have fired a second round from my 
MP5. This has hit him in the right bicep. Mark Duggan then fell to the 
floor.’

V53’s second round went through 
Duggan’s bicep and hit his colleague’s radio, which saved him from 
injury.

The officer added: ‘I have nothing to hide. I want to be open 
and transparent and accountable for my actions.’

The trial continues.

Damage: Firefighters tackle the flames after a fire broke out in a row of shops and residential properties in Croydon, London, during the riots last August

Out in force: Riot police walk along Clarence Road in Hackney last summer. Pockets of rioting and looting broke out in various boroughs of London, and other English cities following the shooting of Mark Duggan
