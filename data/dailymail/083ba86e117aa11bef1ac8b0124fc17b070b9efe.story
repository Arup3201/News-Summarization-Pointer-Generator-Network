Extravagant artwork, gilded antique mirrors and opulent rugs are among the items up for grabs as one retired city banker sells up after discovering there was no room for all his possessions when he downsized.

The anonymous seller is flogging hundreds of items, which are estimated to make £300,000 when they are put up for auction on Friday.

The banker's family are downsizing from their Gloucestershire pile and cannot fit their hoard of heirlooms into their new, smaller home.

Under the hammer: A retired city banker is auctioning hundreds of items after selling his Gloucestershire farm and downsizing. One of the most valuable items for sale is this still life painting by Dutch artist 
Pieter Gerritsz van Roestraten, it is expected to reach £20,000 at Friday's auction

Auction: Among the items is this oil painting entitled Venice From The Lagoon, which is valued at between £3,000 and £5,000

Hoard: The items, which will be sold at auction on Friday, are expected to fetch around £300,000

Treasure trove: Among the items up for sale are opulent rugs, pretty crockery, extravagant works of art and antiques

The treasure trove of 185 lots were amassed by the London-based collector from auction houses all over the world during the 1960s, 70s and 80s - including Monaco, Paris and New York.

The colourful collection includes marble candelabras, a huge exotic painting of a tiger, a Cambodian silver elephant and handmade Liberty carpets.

Experts at Gloucestershire-based auctioneers Dominic Winter reckon the mass could go for more than £300,000 - but admitted it could be far more.

Auctioneer Henry Meadows said: 'Basically we are look at the principal contents of a very nice Gloucestershire country house.

'The owners are downsizing and the items are surplus now so it has all had to come to auction. They are moving to a much smaller house.

'The man who owns it was quite prolific at buying from Sotheby’s and Christie’s in the 1970s to the 1990s in particular.

'He was no stranger to an auction house and bought from all over the world - Monaco, London, New York.

'It is certainly very nice to get this size of collection, amassed from all of these places, right here in the Cotswolds.

'People really could pick up quite a bargain with this one. I mean, a huge mahogany table and chairs for four grand, that is a bargain to be had.'

Historic: A fine and rare pair of Louis XV gilt bronze candle wall holders are valued at between £4,000 and £6,000

Antique treasures: A 19th Century sculpture of a Chinese head (left), carved from wood, featuring astrological sections each with inset characters will also go under the hammer. It is valued at £3,000. And (right) a pair of parcel gilt Neo-Classical torcheres, dating from the late 18th Century, are expected to add another £3,000 to the total raised at Friday's auction

Artwork: An oil painting entitled Tiger At Rest, by British artist George Stubbs (1724-1806) is also up for auction. The striking painting is expected to fetch around £2,000 when it goes under the hammer

Stunning: Among the pieces being sold is this Chinese moon flask (left), dating from the late Qing dynasty. And (right) a Louis XVI gilt wood mirror with intricate features

16th Century: A group of ten watercolour portraits dating from the 16th Century are expected to fetch £12,000

Among the most prized items in the collection is a pair of gilt bronze wall-mounted Louis XV candleholders which were bought for £10,000 from Sotheby’s in Monaco.

The rare 18th century intricate decorations have a guide price of £6,000.

A striking 17th carved wooden Chinese head marking the points for acupuncture is priced at £3,000 and a huge copy of the George Stubbs oil painting of a tiger - identical to one hanging in Blenheim Palace.

Also up for sale are revolving bookcases from India, a pair of Victorian terracotta garden urns and a pair of Neo Classical cherub-topped torches.

It took a team of specially trained hauliers and removal workers two days to load truck after truck of precious belongings from the home.

'When one was being unloaded another was being loaded up,' added Mr Meadows.

'It was quite the military operation.'

Cotswolds: The family are selling their home in the Gloucestershire (left) and downsizing. Among the items they no longer have room for is this fine Regency mirror (right)

Lot: Portrait Of A Lady by the artist John Michael Wright. The painting shows a woman, thought to be Lady Anne Somerset, Lady Howard, daughter of Edward Somerset, second marquess of Worcester. It is valued at between £8,000 and £12,000

French school: A study of a rococo bed chamber at Versailles, late 18th or early 19th Century, valued at £3,000
