From Tony 'Scarface' Montana's 'little friend' - the M16 rifle - to Dirty Harry's Magnum ('the most powerful handgun in the world'), guns and glamour have often gone hand in hand on the big screen.

But now the firearms have been cast in a new light, as these X-ray images show.

The intimate workings of some of cinema’s most iconic weapons, including James Bond's Walther PPK, have been revealed by British artist Nick Veasey in an attempt to 'deglamorise' guns - by reducing them to the status of scientific specimens. 

These X-rays were made by British artist Nick Veasey in an attempt to 'deglamorise' guns - by reducing them to the status of scientific specimens. Above, the M16 entered the United States Army service in 1963 and featured in the film Scarface

'Say hello to my little friend'... A memorable line uttered by Al Pacino, as

with his Magnum in Magnum Force (see below)

A .44 Magnum, famously used by Clint Eastwood in the film Dirty Harry. Veasey was unable to guarantee that the weapons X-rayed for the series were the exact models used in the films since many of the guns have been handled so widely, but they are in all cases the correct model

The 51-year-old used his signature X-ray
technique (combining photography and radiology) on firearms ranging from the tiny Derringer used to
assassinate Abraham Lincoln to the M60 wielded by John Rambo in the 
film First Blood.

'If you’re at your most 
impressionable age and you’re in with the wrong crowd, what gets you 
into serious trouble?,' the artist said.

'If
you get into a punch-up, you can usually walk away from that, whereas 
if you use a gun, it’s likely to affect the rest of your life, one way 
or another.

'That’s the cycle we’re trying to break. They’re not glamorous, they’re machines for killing people.'

The
most famous gun in the series is undoubtedly James Bond’s Walther PPK, 
given a clear 'personality' when 007 turns, looks and fires the gun in 
the opening sequence of the films.

Yet this is the same gun Hitler used to commit suicide with in the Fuhrerbunker - gifted to him as a present by Carl Walther himself as a thank-you for allowing him to arm the German army.

The series features other famous cinematic guns including the Magnum 45, as used by Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry, Terminator’s Spas 12 and the M16 model brandished by actor Al Pacino as he utters the famous line: 'Say hello to my little friend!' in Scarface.

The weapons were sourced from an armorer who provides guns to the cinema industry and were delivered to Veasey’s studio in Maidstone, Kent, by two handlers in an armoured van.

Veasey was unable to guarantee that the weapons X-rayed for the series were the exact models used in the films since many of the guns have been handled so widely, but they are in all cases the correct model. 

The SPAS 12 was used in the first two Terminator films

A Wogdon flintlock dueling pistol, first produced by Robert Wogdon in the 1760s, was used in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies

The Thompson (better known by its nickname 'Tommy Gun') featured in films including Bonnie And Clyde, Public Enemies, and The Untouchables

'For the film, they take away the 
gun’s ability to fire a bullet, but it does fire a blank, so when you 
pull the trigger it goes bang and a flash of light and puff of smoke 
comes out the end,' Veasey said.

'What we’ve done to make them look authentic is reactivated them digitally.

'What they do is weld up the barrel, so we take that away and return the firing pin and we used live ammo.

The M1 Garand featured in the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan. About 4million were produced in World War Two, with General Patton calling the gun 'the greatest battle implement ever devised'

The single-barrelled version appears in the films Wild Wild West and Back to the Future Part 3, and was most famously used in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln

The Anschutz hunting rifle was used by Eric Borel, a French high-school student who, at the age of 16, murdered his family in Toulon in 1995. He later shot dead 12 others and injured four in the village of Cuers

'We asked them how they deactivate the guns and then they’ve guided us through the process of retouching them as they would be live.'

Asked which of the guns is his favourite, Veasey nominates the assault rifles, which he says are 'beautiful things to behold, but scary in the implications of what they can do.'

A close friend of Veasey lost her teenage son to a gun and the artist is hoping that his images encourage teenagers to steer clear of firearms.

'We’re trying to make them look like scientific specimens, almost like a slab on the morgue,' Veasey added.

'Hopefully people will actually look at how they work and think, "If I pick it up and pull the trigger, bullets come out of it", rather than, "If I pick it up, I’m going to be like Rambo or a character from Call of Duty".'

Among the artist's previous work is the world's largest X-ray of a life-sized Boeing 777 jet (created in 2003), which currently resides at Logan Airport in Boston.

The M14 EBR was introduced to the United States Service in 2004 and is frequently used by the Navy Seals and Delta Force

Tears Of The Sun (2003) starring Bruce Willis as a Navy Seal. Right, a scene from British movie Snatch (2000)

The MG42 was a 7.9mm general purpose machine gun that was developed in Nazi Germany and entered service in 1942
