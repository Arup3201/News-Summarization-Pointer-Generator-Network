Loss: Molly Dyer died aged 13, after an allergic reaction to a chicken tikka masala

A father who struggled to come to terms with the loss of his daughter was found dead 18 months after her passing, with a note saying he needed to be with his princess, an inquest heard.

Paul Dyer, 42, never accepted the death of his 13-year-old daughter Molly, who died from a severe allergic reaction to nuts from eating a curry in August 2010.

Mr Dyer was found by staff at the Premier Inn in Prestwich, Bury, in March this year with a note which read: ‘I love you all but I need to be with my princess, love Paul.’

Molly, from Whitefield, Bury, died after going into anaphylactic shock and suffering an asthma attack as a result of eating a chicken tikka masala from a local takeaway.

Her devastated father, a pharmaceutical manager, sat beside her grave almost every day after she died, Rochdale Coroner’s Court heard.

Mr Dyer was found in the hotel room with prescription drugs, alcohol, and a series of notes to family members, including the apology.

Photographs of Molly were also found in the room, the inquest was told.

His body was found by a housekeeper who saw a note pinned to a chair which read: ‘Please be careful with me. I have just killed myself. Sorry you have found me like this.’

His brother, Darren Dyer, told the inquest that Paul had a chair positioned at Molly’s graveside.

Darren, from Eccles, Salford, said: ‘He always put Molly first, no matter what.

‘Molly’s death had a devastating effect on all our lives. Paul never, never came to terms with her death. When Molly died, Paul died with her to be honest.’

Mr Dyer said his brother changed after her death and added: ‘He absolutely worshipped and adored his daughter. After her funeral he spent almost every day at her grave. He had a chair there whether it was raining or sunshine. He spent hours there.’

His mother, Margaret Dyer, aged 70, said: 'Paul couldn’t live without Molly. He tried his best, but he couldn’t cope without her. It was too much for him.

'They were best friends and he took it very hard when she died,' she told Bury Times at the time of her sons passing. 'He idolised her and said she was his princess.'

Molly, who had dreamed of becoming a professional dancer, was diagnosed 
with a peanut allergy at the age of three but managed her condition with the help of her family.

Tragic scene: Mr Dyer was found dead by staff at this Premier Inn in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, with a note saying he needed to be with 'his princess'

The teenager was attending a party with her mother Meryl Matthews where friends had ordered the Indian takeaway from a local restaurant. After eating the chicken tikka masala curry, she collapsed in front of her mother and was rushed to hospital.

Despite medical staff fighting for four hours, they were unable to save the teenager's life. An inquest into Molly’s death heard she had eaten the dish twice the previous week while on holiday with her father.

Mr Dyer, who suffered from asthma, lived in Macclesfield where he worked for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.

He was seeing a counsellor at the time of his death and was on prescribed sleeping tablets.

Coroner Simon Nelson, noted that Mr Dyer had an undiagnosed heart disease and recorded a narrative verdict, but said he believed that he had booked into the hotel intent on taking his life.

Mr Nelson said: ‘It must have been extraordinarily difficult for him and the whole myriad of emotions he was going through.

‘I do believe that his death was a combination of natural and unnatural factors.’

Anaphylactic shock, or anaphylaxis, is an extreme allergic reaction, most commonly to foods, insect stings or drugs

Anaphylaxis sees rapid chemical changes in the body causing breathing difficulties and dramatic swelling – mainly of the face and neck.

If possible, give the person in anaphylactic shock adrenaline medication and immediately call an  ambulance.
