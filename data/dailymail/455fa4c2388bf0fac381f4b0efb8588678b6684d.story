Lonely Planet has ignited a furious row after placing Sydney Opera House above the Great Barrier Reef in a top ten list of ten must-see destinations in its latest Australian edition.

The decision provoked outcry as the Queensland attraction is on the list of Seven Natural Wonders of the World and one of the richest marine environments on the planet.

And there was further grief as a review described ninth-placed the Gold Coast – also in Queensland and a thriving hub of tourist activity - as ‘brash, trashy, hedonistic, and over-hyped’.

Taking the top spot: Sydney Opera House is the best attraction in Australia, according to Lonely Planet

Runner up: Queensland's Great Barrier Reef was pushed into second place in the latest edition of the travel guide

1.Sydney Opera House (NSW)

2, The Great Barrier Reef (QLD)

3. The Museum of Old and New Art (TAS)

4. Uluru (NT, below)

5. Melbourne (VIC)

6. The Daintree (QLD)

7. The Great Ocean Road (VIC)

8. Byron Bay (NSW)

9. Gold Coast (QLD)

10. The food and wine trail (SA)

‘Surfers prefer elsewhere, and paradise has been tragically lost’, the guide claimed.

To add to Queenslanders' gripes, the travel guide also claims Cairns Esplanade lagoon is ‘saltwater’ when it is actually chlorinated.

Megan Bell, from Cairns dive-operator Quicksilver, told The Cairns Post: ‘We believe that the Great Barrier Reef should be the top destination because it’s the world’s largest living organism, it’s interactive, it’s engaging and it’s a natural icon.’

‘While the Opera House is beautiful, we have an underwater symphony of thousands of reef fish and corals’.

While Queensland might be aggrieved by the top 10, it’s not all bad news, with the capital Brisbane named as country’s coolest city in Lonely Planet’s latest guidebook.

Australia government statistics claim two million people visited the Reef in the year ending December 2012, much less than the 8.2 million annual guests of the Sydney Harbour icon.

The Opera House, which supports more than 12,000 jobs, was designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon and opened in 1973.

Alex Blake of Ocean Hotels and Tourism says it is important to the Cairns region and wider Australian tourism that the Great Barrier Reef is duly recognised.

'We need to remind Australians what they have in their backyard ... with tourism returning to strength we need it to be number one to get the word out,' he told The Cairns Post.

The full list features three Queensland destinations, two from New South Wales and two from Victoria and one each from South Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania.

Disappointing: However, the guide was scathing about Surfers Paradise and its attractions
