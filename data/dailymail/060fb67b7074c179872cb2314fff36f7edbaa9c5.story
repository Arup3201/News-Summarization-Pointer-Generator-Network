A potentially deadly cold snap is set to sweep across half of the United States on Monday, bringing freezing temperatures, strong winds, heavy rain and snow to more than 50million people.

A series of 'dangerously cold' arctic air masses will strike almost everywhere east of the Rockies - and will remain for much of the week, Weather Channel meteorologist, Roy Lucksinger, said.

They are likely to send temperatures plummeting to 10 to 20 degrees below average - rivaling last January's arctic outbreak that led to the widespread use of the term 'polar vortex.'

Chilling out: Temps on Monday were expected to be between 10 and 20 degrees below normal as Winter Storm Gorgon blew in from the northwest

One-two punch: Tuesday temperatures were expected to drop even further in the Midwest and Northeast as arctic chills sweep in for a second time this week

'We're looking at 50million people in 24 states seeing some of the coldest weather over the next several days that we have seen in quite some time,' CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said.  

'This arctic cold is potentially deadly and dangerous. Wind chills in Minnesota and the Dakotas are as low as minus 45 degrees. A second blast of cold air will reinforce the deep freeze on Tuesday.' 

Speaking to USA Today, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Kocin added: 'This is going to be a big cold outbreak, pretty windy as well. It's going to drive all the way down south.'

According to the service, heavy rain and mountain snow will strike the Northwest on Monday, while a cold blast of arctic air will sweep across the Midwest.

Then, on Tuesday, a second, 'brutal' blast of frigid air will hit the region, spreading to the Plains and the East. This will last until at least Thursday, it is predicted.

Deadly: The first arctic blast on Monday will be followed by a second on Tuesday. They are likely to send temperatures plummeting up to 35 degrees below average. Above, a graphic of the blasts expected this week

Snowy weather: In the northern Plains, Ohio Valley and upper Midwest, temperatures could drop to minus 45 degrees. Above, a car is pictured sitting a ditch along Bristol Avenue NW, in Walker, Michigan, on Sunday

Chilly: People are being urged to dress in warm clothing  to avoid developing frostbite. Above, a graphic of the cold temperatures expected on Monday - purple represents temperatures of below minus 10 degrees

'The first push of cold air is pretty cold, but not as cold as the second shot starting Tuesday,' Frank Strait, senior meteorologist for AccuWeather.com, said, describing it as a 'one-two punch'.

His colleague, senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski, added that gusty winds accompanying the arctic blasts will result in much lower temperatures than usual - and ones that could prove deadly.

'Because of this, the air will be beyond painful, reaching dangerous and life-threatening levels in  the Midwest and Northeast for those who spend a significant amount of time outdoors without proper protection,' he said, adding that the freezing daytime temperatures will only drop further at night.

For many parts of the country, temperatures will reach highs of just zero to the teens and twenties.

In Chicago - which will see the tail end of a storm that could leave up to as much as five inches of snow by early Tuesday - residents are expected to see highs of just zero degrees on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, in New York, rainy showers will give way to cold air. By Thursday, the Big Apple 'will be lucky if it hits 20' for a high and could see lows near 10 degrees, forecasters said. 

A storm system will also bring a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain to parts of upstate New York.  

In the south, even Atlanta, Georgia, will see low temperatures of around 15 degrees on Monday and Tuesday - but there is not expected to be any ice to accompany the chilly weather.

And in the West, a stream of Pacific moisture will drop as much as six inches of rain in the Seattle area - and could mean substantial snowfall in the Cascades.

Snow could also coat portions of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, as well as the more western states of Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Utah.

Further south in San Francisco - a part of the U.S. that desperately needs rain - skies will be sunny.

A dip in the jet stream means cold air from Canada and points north is plummeting into the eastern two-thirds of the United States. However, forecasters are shying away from calling it a 'polar vortex'.

The forthcoming cold can be linked to the dip, according to Michael Musher, with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.

This is because the air is coming from near the north pole, he said. But the low-pressure system itself isn't going to sink into the United States this year, just the temperatures that precede it.

Wind chill warnings and advisories are currently active in the Midwest, Great Lakes and Northeast.

By the end of the week, temperatures are expected to lift slightly, forecasters said. 

Over the weekend, snow and ice fell in the eastern United States, while violent thunderstorms were seen in the deep south, including two tornadoes in Mississippi, AccuWeather.com reported.

Heavy snow also fell in the Great Lakes region, causing several traffic accidents in Michigan.
