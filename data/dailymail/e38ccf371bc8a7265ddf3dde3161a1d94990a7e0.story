A Peugeot spokesman said: ‘The 2014 "Car of the Year" title represents the most prestigious recognition for the 308, which embodies the brand’s values of excellence.’

‘Sales success has already been achieved, with more than 55,000 orders recorded since the launch of the model; the new 308 is also contributing towards the brand’s move up-market, confirmed by the mix of the orders, a higher proportion of which is for the upper trim levels in its range.’

He added: ’The prestigious 2014 "Car of the Year" award, which I receive today on behalf of everyone at Peugeot who has contributed towards the development and launch of the award winning new 308, is the best confirmation of this’.
