She confessed she looks nothing like the star and questioned whether she would be able to do her justice.

But it appears Helena Bonham Carter has risen to the challenge.

Styled and made up to look like Elizabeth Taylor, there appears to be no trace of the eccentric 46-year-old English actress hidden underneath.

Seeing double? The real Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor

And she’s not the only one to do her role justice. Actor Dominic West, 43, is the spitting image of Richard Burton.

The pair play the tempestuous lovers in a new BBC film with the first pictures released yesterday.

The award-winning Miss Bonham Carter and the charismatic Mr West play the pair as they were in 1983, reunited for a US production of Noel Coward’s Private Lives.

Audiences were desperate to know if they would reconcile and it helped shift tickets.

Earlier this year Miss Bonham Carter 
said: ‘Elizabeth was fifty-one, still every inch a star, still 
beautiful  and they still needed each other but this was professional.’

Burton and Taylor fell in love on the set of the 1963 movie Cleopatra. Both had partners and they eventually married in 1964.

After ten tempestuous years they exhausted each other and divorced in 1974. Soul mates, within a year they were hitched, only to break up again fifteen months later.

The drama will be screened on TV  later this year.
