A blind mechanic has told how he still fix cars - purely by feel and the sound of the engine.

Edsel Hammond, 45, from Charlotte, Vermont, lost his sight after setting up a business in his 20s.

But instead of letting the rare and debilitating condition, called scotomas, prevent him from doing the job he loved, Mr Hammond relied on his other senses.

Sense: Blind mechanic Edsel Hammond relies on touch and feel to find the problem

The father-of-two described the horror of waking up one morning when he was 24 to discover his eyesight was failing.

Mr Hammond told WCAX.com: 'I woke up one morning and the eye that 
had the spot in it was completely black.

'I couldn't see anything out of 
it. And then the other eye was starting to have issues and that was very
 scary.'

The rare degenerative disease - which leaves sufferers with large dark patches of vision - has robbed Mr Hammond of much of his vision now.

Inspiring: Edsel Hammond, 45, lost his sight when he was 24 but the condition did not prevent him from continuing as a mechanic

Adapting to adversity: Edsel Hammond has specially adapted tools to enable him to find it quickly when he is under a car bonnet

But he has developed new skills and techniques which enable him to solve almost any mechanical problem with which he is presented.

He listens to the sound of the engine and feels parts to determine what fault needs repairing.

And his condition has not deterred any customers from using his car repair business.

Edsel said: 'If I look right at you I don't see anything. I have what they call central scotomas, where I can't see anything.

Vocation: Mr Hammond, of Charlotte, Vermont, was named after the 1958 motorcar and loved to fix vehicles from a young age

'If I look to the side a little bit I can see kind of a blurred, like an old grainy television and some of your outline, but I don't see any details.'

Mr Hammond, whose father and grandmother were mechanics, was born to work with cars - and was even named after a 1958 Edsel car, widely recognised as one of the worst cars made.

He grew up on his family's gas station in Shelburne and it appears the mechanical bent is in the genes.

Both his sons have followed in their father's footsteps and become car mechanics.
