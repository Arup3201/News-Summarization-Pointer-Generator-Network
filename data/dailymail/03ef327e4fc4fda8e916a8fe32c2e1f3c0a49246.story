A woman whose family was wiped out in a car crash said 'I lost my everybody' in the collision.

Elber Twomey was the only survivor after the crash which took the lives of her husband, their son and their unborn child.

The suicidal driver of the other vehicle was also killed.

'I lost my everbody': Elber Twomey criticises the police who she blames for causing the crash which killed her husband, her son and her unborn child in Torquay, Devon

Yesterday Mrs Twomey, who was 24 weeks pregnant at the time, said her family would still be alive if police hadn’t pursued the car of 26-year-old Marek Wojiechowski.

Emergency services were contacted after he left his wife a suicide note, and when his car was spotted, an officer gave chase, switching on his flashing lights and siren.

Wojiechowski then ‘deliberately’ drove straight into the Twomeys family’s VW Golf during their holiday in Torquay, Devon.

Oisin Twomey, who was 16 months old, died at the scene.

Crash scene: A father, a son and his wife's unborn child all died following this crash in Torquay, Devon, in July last year. Marek Wojiechowski deliberately crashed his vehicle into the Twomey family's VW Golf

Grief: Elber Twomey with her husband Con on their wedding day. He died 10 months after a crash which killed their toddler son

His father Con, 39, died later ten months later in hospital after suffering serious brain injuries.

Yesterday Mrs Twomey, who was hospitalised for months and lost her unborn daughter, spoke after the inquest of her son and the Polish taxi-driver.

She believes that police driver’s approach was ‘completely wrong’ and caused Wojiechowski to panic.

Speaking on the last day of the inquest in Torquay, she said of the day of the crash in July 2012: ‘I lost my everybody.

‘Up to 2.46pm on July 6th I had not a care in the world.

‘I was on holiday with my darling husband and best friend Con, our beautiful little man, baba Oisin and our beautiful unborn daughter. At 2.47pm our wonderful life ended.’

She continued:’I will always be of the opinion that the manner in which the police dealt with Marek that horrific day was completely wrong.

‘I believe that a more cautious and considered response by the police is necessary to protect lives. The lack of this caution has cost me my entire family.’

She continued: ‘I believe it was a misjudgement by the police officer involved to request Marek to stop.

‘He was not driving erratically, he did not have his wife and children with him and he had not indicated that he would end his life by using his car.

‘While I don’t blame the police officer involved personally for my tragic story, I do blame the police service.’

The inquest heard that Wojiechowski had agreed to split with his wife Agnieszka and left a four-page suicide note.

Accident victim: Oisin Twomey, aged 16 months, who died at the scene following the crash in Torquay, Devon, last year

She raised the alarm when she found the letter and CCTV cameras recorded him circling a roundabout and driving in a continuous two-mile loop.

Police response driver PC Ben Bickford spotted a black car driving in the opposite carriageway and followed to see if it was Wojiechowski.

Suicidal: Marek Wojciechowski who caused the crash which wiped out a young family

He drove between 70 and 80 mph to catch up and flashed his lights to signal the driver to pull over.

PC Bickford told a previous hearing of the inquest: ‘When I saw that he wasn’t going to stop I pulled back. I am not a trained pursuit driver. The driver was aware of my presence.

‘As we approached the single carriageway he made a deliberate act of accelerating and driving straight into the other carriageway.’

Wojiechowski, a former chef, was arrested at the scene but died from his injuries later that day in hospital.

Mr Twomey was transported back to a hospital near his native Cork in Ireland but died in May this year.

In a narrative verdict, a
 jury of 10 said that both Oisin and Wojiechowski died because the
 Pole had ‘suddenly steered his car across the road into the opposite 
carriageway and accelerated into oncoming traffic in an attempt to 
commit suicide.’

Coroner 
for Plymouth, Torbay and South Devon, Ian Arrow said the police officer 
involved did all he could but he planned to write to the Association of 
Chief Police Officers to ask for a review.

He
 said: ‘Particular review should be given to how police officers should 
approach and deal with distressed or vulnerable individuals. It may 
require further with health care professionals.’

Chief Superintendent and head of operations for Devon and Cornwall Police, Jim Nye, said after the inquest that the police officer acted appropriately and in line with national guidelines.

Mrs Twomey said she rejected the findings of an IPCC report that said ‘no learning outcomes or organisational learning was identified’ from the tragedy.
