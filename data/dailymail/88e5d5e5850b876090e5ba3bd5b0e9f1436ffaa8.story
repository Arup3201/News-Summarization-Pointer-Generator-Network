A Tory MP has insisted he is not homophobic – because he once fought a gay boxer with the nickname the Pink Pounder.

David Davies, the MP for Monmouth, outraged many equal rights campaigners when he said that parents hoped for heterosexual children because they wanted grandchildren.

But he compounded his apparent offence when he took to Twitter to defend himself against charges that he was bigoted.

He described his antics with Charles ‘Pink Pounder’ Jones on the social networking site: ‘Once fought gay boxer. Respect & like.’

He added: ‘Trained with after bout so 
not bigoted. activists calm down- listen to other views.’ He also posted
 a link to a poor quality video of the fight on YouTube.

Mr Davies – whose nickname is The Tory Tornado – is an amateur boxer.

He
 beat Mr Jones, an architect who is Britain’s first openly gay boxer, on
 points over three rounds in the 2008 bout in a central London gym.

At
 the time, Mr Jones, who was 48, said: ‘In the weeks leading up to the 
fight, everyone was telling me I had to make mincemeat of him.

'I’m not 
sure whether that was because they wanted me to win or because they 
wanted to see an MP get beaten up, but suffice to say it was a 
disappointment when I lost.

‘In my defence, he is 11 years my junior and extremely strong, but I was still on my feet by the end of the match.’

Mr Davies, 42, is a former tobacco-picker and lorry driver who also serves as a special constable. He once arrested a man carrying a loaded gun.

His initial remarks about gay children came in the middle of Tory wrangling over gay marriage.

Senior Tories, including former prime
 minister Sir John Major, Chancellor George Osborne, Education Secretary
 Michael Gove and London Mayor Boris Johnson are backing measures to 
permit equal marriage.

But 120 Conservative MPs have indicated some degree of unease at the proposals in correspondence with constituents.

Mr
 Davies told the BBC: ‘I think most people are very tolerant and have no
 problem at all if people are gay but, and I hate to say this in a way 
because I expect it’s going to cause controversy, but I think most 
parents would prefer their children not to be gay, knowing most parents 
want grandchildren if nothing else.’

He
 laid bare the party’s tensions over the subject, saying: ‘There is a 
political calculation here, at some level, that this is going to be good
 and that if we go ahead with it, David Cameron’s going to be carried 
shoulder high back into Number 10 by Stonewall [gay rights] activists.

‘What
 is going to happen is that we’re going to lose a large number of very 
loyal activists who’ve gone out and campaigned for us over the years and
 who don’t like this idea, so politically it’s barking mad.’
