New Zealand fly-half Dan Carter has warned England that prolific wing Julian Savea is in 'red hot' form.

Savea has plundered 29 tries in 30 appearances for the All Blacks, but it is against the Red Rose that he has been at his most lethal by touching down eight times in four matches.

The 24-year-old has been described as better than Jonah Lomu by All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen and will be the world champions' main strike weapon in Saturday's QBE Series opener at Twickenham.

'Julian has really grown. He's such a huge threat and a great player to have on your side,' Carter told Sky Sports News.

'He's strong, he's powerful, he's fast, he can break tackles and he loves scoring tries.

'He has a great strike rate against England and every time he pulls on the All Blacks jersey. He's in pretty red hot form and is a great player to play alongside.'

Savea is on a collision course with Semesa Rokoduguni, the serving British Army soldier who is set to make his England debut on the opposite wing.

Savea is in imperious form for the All Blacks, he has scored 29 tries in 30 appearances for New Zealand

'Every player who pulls on the England jersey performs out of their skin, even more so in the early stages of their career,' Carter said.

'For Rokoduguni to come into an environment like this.....he's got nothing to lose and will make the most of the opportunity.'

Carter won his 101st cap in Saturday's 74-6 thrashing of the United States, but Hansen hinted afterwards that he is unlikely to start against England.

Savea has been most prolific against England, scoring eight tries in four appearances 

The last 12 months have seen the 32-year-old complete a six-month sabbatical and rehabilitate a broken leg and troublesome calf, restricting his availability for the All Blacks.

However, his seven starts at Twickenham have left him with a clear understanding of the size of occasion on Saturday.

'Every time we play at Twickenham it's a huge match and this weekend is no different. It's a great stadium and a great place to play,' Carter said.

'The All Blacks love playing there and it's never an easy match. It's going to be a huge occasion and we'll be up against a strong England side.'
