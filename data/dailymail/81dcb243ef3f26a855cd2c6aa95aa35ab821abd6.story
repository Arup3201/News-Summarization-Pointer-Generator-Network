Hollywood superstar Cate Blanchett and husband Andrew Upton have swapped the usual glamour of the Hollywood Hills and snapped up a little piece of paradise on the Hawksbury River in northern Sydney. 

It's no surprise the creative pair have opted for a rather unusual location as their new weekend hideaway from the prying eyes of the paparazzi. 

Word got out in August that the twice-Academy award winning actress and her playwright husband had purchased the stunning three floor wooden property which backs onto beautiful bushland.

Cate Blanchett and husband Andrew Upton purchased their dream property in August 

The three-floor waterfront home is tucked away in the beauty and seclusion of Berowra Waters on Berowra Creek, a tributary of the Hawkesbury River

The home, which the couple purchased for $1,495,000, has stunning river views 

Local agent John Moxham told the Sydney Morning Herald 'there's not a lot of bling down here'. 

Mr Moxham would not reveal the identity of the new occupiers but also told the SMH 'whenever anyone moves here or even if they're just renting, we all know about it very quickly'. 

With only 150 homes built in the secluded location sources say word was rife in August when the famous pair signed the contracts that a pair of celebrities might be the new residents.

The home the Lord of the Rings star Blanchett and Upton have bought has a one bedroom self contained unit on the bottom floor.

The second and third floor consist of three bedrooms, living and dining rooms that have spectacular waterfront views with a timber stainless-steel kitchen perfect for entertaining guests. 

To add to the luxury the home comes with a spa, sauna, pontoon and terraced gardens and trees which surround the property.

The couple own several properties across NSW including homes in Elizabeth Bay, Gladesville and Hunters Hill

The house also comes with a spa and sauna to add to the feeling of luxury 

There are stunning views out to the Hawkesbury River all over the property from the bedrooms to the entertaining areas

The house will be a perfect getaway for Blanchett and Upton, who met in 1996 and later married in 1997, and their three sons Dashiell John born in 2001, Roman Robert born in 2004 and Ignatius Martin born in 2008. 

The couple initially lived in Brighton, England, in the early 2000s but made the move back to Australia because they wanted to be closer to family and make a permanent base for their growing family.

A couple of the local gems Blanchett and Upton might sample include the Berowra Waters Inn restaurant and Berowra Waters Fish Cafe. 

Blanchett and Upton will be able to entertain their children and guests with the amazing water views close by 

The three bedroom home is surrounded by lush bushland with lots of stunning walking trails 

The home has a Finnish sauna and landscaped gardens cascading down the pontoon 

Berowra Waters is located within an hours drive of Sydney CBD and is accessible by train making it a very easy place to get to each weekend

A resident who didn't want to be named said: 'The beautiful location is tucked away from prying eyes and will give the family the chance to be normal.'

Blanchett and Upton bought the home from Elizabeth Gaines, a non-executive director of Fortescue Metals and chief executive of travel retailer Halloworld, according to the SMH. 

Although estate agents would not reveal the identity of the new owners Mr Moxham confirmed to the SMH that the home was bought in the name of a company of which the sole director is Andrew Upton.

Berowra Waters is located 40 kilometres north of Sydney's CBD and can be accessed within an hours drive. 

Daily Mail Australia approached Mr Moxham for comment and is yet to receive a reply.
