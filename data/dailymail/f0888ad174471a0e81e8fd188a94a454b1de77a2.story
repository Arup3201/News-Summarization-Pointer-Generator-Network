A recent plague of feral cats could mean Australia's native bilbies are on the verge of extinction, with only 200 marsupials left in a Queensland national park

A recent plague of feral cats could mean Australia's native bilbies are on the verge of extinction, with only 200 marsupials left in a Queensland national park. 

Astrebla Downs National Park, west of Brisbane, Queensland, is the 'state's most important wild population of the greater bilby', according to Queensland's Department of National Parks, which homed around 700 bilbies in recent times.

Now, Andrew Powell, Queensland Environment and Heritage Minister, has told Radio National's Background Briefing that bilbies are diminishing due to feral cat attacks, the ABC reported. 

Despite Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service attempt to kill off more than 3,000 feral cats by spending $350,000 to shoot them, the bilby population is still heading for extinction.

But Minister Powell insists his department will not let that happen. 

'As a state we will do what we can and we'll continue to put funds towards their management and obviously any additional funds that come from the Federal Government would be welcome,' he said

'We have seen feral cats occurring in plague proportions over the last few years, particularly in key areas such as the habitat of the greater bilby which has had dire consequences.'

In the radio interview Minister Powell declares war on feral cats.

The high number of feral cats appeared when a plague of longhaired rats entered the 176,000 hectare property, home to hundreds of protected bilbies.

Once all the rats had been eaten, the feral cats began to feed on the marsupials and between 2012 and 2014 over 120 bilbies were found inside feral cats. 

 Frank Manthey, co-founder of Save the Bilby said the government needs to spend more time on this 'heartbreaking' problem

Frank Manthey, co-founder of Save the Bilby said the government needs to spend more time on this 'heartbreaking' problem. 

He said the bilbies that were pulled out of the dissected feral cats were young and inexperienced, making it even more devastating for the bilby population. 

Mr Manthey believes government officials and conservation groups should get involved in a summit and figure out a solution before it is too late. 

Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt agreed with Mr Manthey and said that next year he will plans to host the summit and will suggest government parties sign a 10-year plan to stop bilby extinction.
