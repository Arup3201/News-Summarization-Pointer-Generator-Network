Andrew Parker has today been unveiled as the new director general of MI5

A keen birdwatcher who has led MI5’s fight against international terrorism was yesterday named Britain’s new spymaster.

Andrew Parker, a married father-of-two, will take charge of the Security Service next month.

Home Secretary Theresa May said the 50-year-old - who has worked in security and intelligence for three decades - would bring a ‘wealth of experience’ to the job.

He led MI5’s response to the July 7 terrorist attacks in London, overseeing a huge expansion in the Security Service’s resources.

Officials say his teams of officers also played the lead role in the disruption of Al Qaida’s attempt to attack multiple transatlantic airliners with bombs hidden in drinks bottles in 2006.

He was appointed Deputy Director General of MI5 in April 2007 and has long been considered the favourite to land the top job.

For the past six years he has been responsible for all the security service’s investigative and operational work - during which time a string of major plots have been disrupted.

His biography, revealed on the MI5 website, says Mr Parker ‘enjoys the outdoors and is a keen ornithologist and wildlife photographer.’

Mrs May said Mr Parker brings ‘a wealth of experience and knowledge’ to the job.

She added: ‘Under his leadership the Service will continue to stay ahead of global and domestic threats to our national security and further develop its reputation as one of the world’s most effective security agencies.’

Mr Parker, said: ‘It is a great honour to be appointed Director General of MI5.

‘I am extremely proud of the 
extraordinary work the men and women of MI5 do to keep the country safe 
in challenging circumstances. I look forward to leading the Service 
through its next chapter.’

The Cambridge University Natural 
Sciences graduate has worked on Middle East terrorism, counter 
espionage, Northern Ireland terrorism, serious and organised crime, 
protective security, policy and strategic planning during his 30 year 
career.

He spent three years on secondment to
HM Customs & Excise as Director Intelligence before returning to 
the Service in 2002 to join the Board as Director for Northern Ireland 
terrorism, Protective Security & Serious Crime.

Mr Parker replaces Sir Jonathan Evans, who is standing down next month after six years in charge.

Earlier this week, Mrs May praised 
Sir Jonathan’s ‘tireless work’ in helping to ensure there were no 
terrorist attacks on the London Olympics. A string of terrorist 
atrocities were also foiled on his watch.

Mr Parker will face what officials call a ‘diversifying’ range of threats against the UK’s interests.

On Wednesday, the Home office 
revealed medicine is being stockpiled in readiness for a possible 
biological attack on a city centre or train station by terrorists, 
security officials revealed yesterday.

Officials also warned of the 
possibility of a Mumbai-style firearms attack on a crowded place, and 
British extremists returning from the civil war in Syria to launch a 
plot at home.
