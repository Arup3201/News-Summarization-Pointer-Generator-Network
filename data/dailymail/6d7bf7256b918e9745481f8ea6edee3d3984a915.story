An Oklahoma mother was arrested on a charge of child abuse murder after police say her 3-year-old foster son died from a severe head injury.

Mallory Krajian, 25, from Broken Arrow, was taken into custody Tuesday. Her husband, Peter Krajian, 44, was also arrested on a child abuse charge in a separate case.

The couple's foster son Andrew Prior was rushed to a hospital August 27 suffering from blunt force trauma to the head. Despite the doctors' efforts, the toddler's condition gradually worsened and he passed away from his injures five days later.

Too young: Andrew Prior, 3, was taken to a hospital last week suffering from head trauma. Five days later, he died from fractures and brain hemorrhage 

According to court filings, Mrs Krajian told police the 3-year-old was jumping on the couch when he fell and hit his head on a table.

However, investigators found that the foster mother’s account was not consistent with the severity of the boy's injuries.

Andrew Prior is survived by a four-year-old sister and 6-year-old brother. The couple have been caring for siblings for more than a year, NewsOn6 reported. 

Barbara Friend, the children’s biological great aunt, told the station KJRH that the kids were removed from the home of their birth parents, Angela and Matthew Prior, due to neglect.

Peter Krajian is facing charges for allegedly abusing his foster daughter. At the time of the incident involving Andrew, the 44-year-old father was allegedly sleeping.

Cruelty: Doctors found bald spots on little Andrew's head from alleged hair-pulling and bruises on his body; the toddler's 4-year-old sister was also allegedly abused 

When questioned by police, Mallory Krajian allegedly hinted that one of the older children might have been responsible for injuring the toddler.

Court documents stated that the boy sustained a skull fracture, neck fracture and brain haemorrhage. Doctors also found bald spots on the toddler's head from suspected hair-pulling and bruises on his body.

The Krajians were approached by the Department of Human Services last summer asking them to foster Andrew and his brother and sister after their biological parents were charged with child neglect.

Police in Broken Arrow said they have no record of calls about domestic violence or disturbances from the Krajians’ home.

Mallory Krajian is being held on $250,000 bail, while her husband is jailed on $25,000 bail.

Andrew's surviving brother and sister have been released back into the custody of the DHS.
