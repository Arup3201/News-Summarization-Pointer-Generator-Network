Wedding and party season fast approaches and if you're stuck for cake inspiration - bored of tired old fruit cake and marzipan, like most of us - there is a ghoulish alternative.

Annebel de Vetten, nicknamed Annabel Lecter, is the go-to baker if you want something truly memorable. A tower of birds' skulls, for example, or a startlingly lifelike hairy hog's head.

Annabel runs the Conjurer's Kitchen in Birmingham and specialises in the kind of cakes you won't find in your local bakery.

Brain food: Annabel has become famous for her terrifyingly realistic cakes - a motley collection of dead baby heads, skinned birds, rodent skulls, blood soaked intestines and human brains, pictured here, made out of marshmallow

Baker Annabel said: 'When people look at my cakes, they recoil in disgust, but it's funny watching their expressions as they bite into a bit of intestine and realise it tastes like chocolate cake'

Pig's dinner: These remarkable pig's heads are delicious cakes. 'You should never be afraid to try things,' says alternative baker Annabel De Vetten

Annabel - nicknamed Annabel Lecter by her friends - only began baking four years ago, and now spends around 30 hours on each of her terrifying but delicious masterpieces

The
 ghoulishly creative baker, 42, has become famous for her terrifyingly realistic cakes - a motley collection of dead baby heads, skinned birds, rodent skulls, blood-soaked intestines and human brains.

Annabel only began baking three years
 ago, but now spends around 30 hours making each one out of sponge cake,
 icing, marshmallows and chocolate, and sells each for upwards of £400.

She said: 'When people look at my cakes, they recoil in disgust, but thankfully when they taste them, they love them.

'But it's funny watching their expressions as they bite into a bit of intestine and realise it tastes like chocolate cake.'

Internal surgery cake, left and shrunken head cake, right, are just two of the weird and wacky cakes made by Anna De Vetten of Conjurer's Kitchen in Kings Heath

She
 continued: 'With stuff like the life-size baby's heads, which are made 
from white chocolate and therefore look kind of dead, it obviously isn't
 to everyone's taste - but they're certainly different and that's not 
always a bad thing.

'You should never be afraid to try things.'

Annabel began cracking eggs and creaming 
butter just three years ago as she baked her own wedding cake when she 
tied the knot to magician Thom, 48.

After the cake, featuring a little 
magician on top instead of a bride and groom, went down a storm with 
guests, she quit her job as a sculptor to set up her own bakery,
 Conjurer's Kitchen.

She 
said: 'I started off just making cakes that were magician-themed, but I 
started getting more gruesome requests - and things just escalated into 
making dead baby heads and human hearts.

'My
 cakes resemble human organs, mummified heads and life-sized skulls - 
they're for people with a sweet tooth but a strong stomach.'

Frightfully good: Annabel de Vetten, pictured here, from Kings Heath has made an edible tiger at her Conjurers Kitchen. Prices for her cakes start at £75

Coffin cake! Annabel has also made a serial killer cake and an unusual bondage-themed wedding cake

Leaning towards more unusual and creatively decorated cakes, Conjurers Kitchen's creations range from 'artistic to anatomical,' such as the Cold Cuts Cake, left, or the Croc Hudson, right

She added: 'I just sort of fell into 
this business. I didn't make my wedding cake with the mind to get into 
baking, we only had a small budget for our ceremony and I thought it 
would be a bit of fun and a penny-saver.

'But the cake came out really well and I had a lot of fun doing it. It just went from there and now I love my job.

'My
 family are so supportive of my gruesome cakes business - they would 
probably find it weirder if I made pretty and girly cakes because that 
just isn't me.'

Not advised for a children's birthday party: Annabel de Vetten's cakes are sponge, decorated with icing sugar, chocolate and marshmallow, and sell for upwards of £400

Shudder: A skinned human face cake - one of the gruesome creations of Annabel de Vetten from Birmingham

Last remains: A sliced face cake made by Annabel is eaten off a plate and reveals that it really is just cake inside the very thick decorative icing

Annabel has since created a serial killer cake and a bondage-themed wedding cake.

Her website, Conjurerskitchen.com, lists her past projects, gives you tips and ideas for your cakes and welcomes any suggestion - no job is too big or small for Annabel.

On the website's blog, Annabel writes about her most unusual requests and experiences.

Dead birds and hooked beaks: Annabel fell into her business by accident, after making the cake for her wedding three years ago and receiving requests from guests for similar cakes

'I based one cake on the bejewelled skeletons of saints displayed in churches throughout Europe.

'Of course my jewels were entirely edible, as well as the rest.

'I pretty much used every sweet edible material under the sun; cake, chocolate, buttercream, marzipan, sugar paste, hard candy and sugar balls.

'It was devoured by over 100 visitors pretty quickly! It was a fantastic evening and a marvellous event to be a part of.'

Annabel said: 'My family are so supportive of my gruesome cakes business - they would probably find it weirder if I made pretty and girly cakes because that just isn't me'

Blood and guts and gore: 'I started off just making cakes that were magician-themed, but I started getting more gruesome requests - and things just escalated into making dead baby heads and human hearts'

Slice, ma'am? A mummy cake, another of Annabel's ghoulish desserts
