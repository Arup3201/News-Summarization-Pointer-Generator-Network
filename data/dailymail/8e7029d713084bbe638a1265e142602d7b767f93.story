She was already helping her closest friend cope with the terrible news that her husband had terminal cancer.

It was only natural for Jane Plume, 41, to want to help Gina and Shaun Hibberd and their two sons.

That, however, was only the start of the mother-of-three’s generosity as soon afterwards, Mrs Hibberd, 37, was killed in a car crash.

¿It may seem like a strange set-up but it works¿: Miss Plume with

As Miss Plume helped her friend’s grieving husband look after the boys, he asked her to promise that they would be cared for when he passed away.

She gave up her job as a personal assistant to care full-time for Mr Hibberd, 40, an HGV driver, and his sons as well as her own children.

After he died two years later in November 2012, the single mother became legal guardian to Lewis, now 14, and Ashton, now seven, making them part of her family.

To minimise the upheaval to their 
lives, she even moved from her home in Loughborough, Leicestershire, 
into the Hibberd family home, also in the town.

She took her two youngest  children, Millie, now 17, and Annie-Mae, seven, while her son, Marco, 19, stayed in her house.

Upheaval: After the boys' father died last November, Jane moved herself and her two youngest children, Millie, right, and Annie-Mae, second from right, into her late best friend's family home to try and minimise the impact on the grieving brothers

‘The
kids were already close because Gina and I were friends for so long, so
they were like brothers and sisters,’ said Miss Plume.

‘I
didn’t think twice about taking them on – Gina was my best friend and I
would have done anything for her. It was devastating when Shaun asked 
me to take care of the kids when he had gone but everyone knew it would 
be the best thing.

‘I’m glad
I could do her this one last favour. If it had been the other way 
round, I know Gina would have done the same for me. We were just like 
sisters. I think Gina would be happy with the arrangement and I know the
children are all happy.

‘There isn’t a day goes by that I don’t miss her but at least I have a part of her with me in her sons.

'I have a part of her with me': Jane, right with Gina, said her three children were already close to Lewis and Ashton because their mothers had been friends for so long

Support: Ms Plume said the children were as close as siblings before tragedy struck as she and Gina had been friends for so long

The chain of events began in June 2009 when Mr Hibberd was diagnosed with testicular cancer.

His
wife, also a personal assistant, turned to her friend of 14 years for 
help. The Hibberds organised a renewal of their vows to help cope with 
the devastating news. But, while on her way to a new job, Mrs Hibberd 
and another driver died at the scene of a horrific car crash in October 
2010.

‘I went into shock and just kept focusing on caring for Shaun and the boys,’ said Miss Plume.

'Like sisters': Ms Plume says she knows best friend Gina would have done 'exactly the same for her'

Grief: Gina, pictured with Shaun on the couple's last holiday together, had been coping with the news of her husband's cancer diagnosis when she was killed in the car accident

As his health worsened, they made arrangements for the future care of his children.

‘It may seem like a strange set-up to some but for us it works and it keeps us all settled and comfortable,’ she added.

‘The kids all get along well and care for each other like any other brothers and sisters.’

She is training to be a holistic therapist after being inspired by the good care which Mr Hibberd received in hospital.
