Two sisters who were both sexually abused by their next door neighbour in their childhood have successfully waged a war to bring him to justice, 40 years later.

Sisters Debbie Grafham, 47 and Laraine Delgiudice, 45,  were subjected to a horrific campaign of abuse by Patrick Ryan, 64, who lived in the flat above theirs in Blackheath, south-east London.

Over 40 years later, the two sisters have waived their right to anonymity after successfully seeing their abuser brought to justice, in the hope that their story will encourage other victims to speak out.

Sisters Laraine (left,aged 5), and Debbie (right, aged 7) suffered three years of abuse in secret

Debbie was nine-years-old and Laraine just seven when Patrick began to abuse them.

The abuse continued in secret for three years, between 1974 and 1978, until the girls moved house.

Patrick was jailed for 12 years in June this year at Woolwich Crown Court.

Debbie recalls: ‘One day Laraine had gone upstairs to play while Mum was at her cleaning job. I’d gone to the park two minutes away with friends.  But I popped back briefly.

‘As I opened the door I could hear Laraine screams upstairs.

Patrick was found guilty of four rapes, two attempted rapes and 7 counts of indecent assault against the sisters, and sentenced to 12 years

‘Dashing up, horror filled my eyes.  Pat was on top of Laraine on the landing, abusing her.  She was crying, he was shouting.'

Although Debbie managed to pull Patrick off her sister, he then used the threat of abusing her further to begin abusing Debbie.

‘Patrick told me “If you don’t want me to touch your sister then I’ll do it to you.  But my brother’s a policeman and if you tell he’ll take you away”

‘I was nine, her big sister, I wanted to keep her safe.  But he started abusing me, touching me, he raped me too,’ Debbie says.

Patrick continued to abuse them both for years.

‘Our lives were hell but we kept the abuse secret.  After three years we moved -  a relief - but the damage was done.

‘Loraine struggled at school, I grew depressed, suffered panic attacks. Mum knew we’d changed but had no idea why.’ she says.

Although both sisters went on to marry and have children, the abuse continued to blight their lives and they suffered psychological trauma as a result of their experiences.

Debbie suffered from anorexia and mood swings while Laraine struggled with alcohol.

The breaking point came when Larine nearly died from liver failure and entered a rehab facility.

‘I went round to see her one day,’ Debbie says, ‘she was in a terrible state. Her skin was yellow, she was near collapse.’ 

Debbie rushed Larriane to hospital and was told she would be lucky to live through the night

Larraine pulled through, but her liver was damaged and she was in hospital for months detoxing.

However she started drinking again and was re-admitted and while there she fell and broke her pelvis.

Although both sisters went on to marry and have children, the psychological damage of the abuse remained. Pictured is Debbie on her wedding day with Laraine as her bridesmaid

This time when she vowed to stop 
drinking she did, and also made the brave decision to open up about the 
abuse she had suffered in childhood.

Debbie says: ‘While she was in rehab  I had a visit from the police.

‘Laraine had told a social worker about her past. Now the police were asking if I’d make a statement.

‘Nearly 40 years had passed. I was afraid of speaking out  after having kept our secret so long. But at the same time I knew  this was my chance to make sure that twisted paedo finally paid for what he'd done.

'”He raped me too,” I said simply.

‘That night I went to see Laraine in hospital and told her.  She was shocked as she'd no idea he'd done it to me too.

Debbie Grafham gave evidence in person at the trial

‘We told our husbands and they were so supportive and a few weeks later the police arrested and charged him.'

Five months later case went to trial at Woolwich Crown Court.

Laraine had been bed-bound since her fall but she gave evidence via video link, but Debbie spoke in court in front of Patrick.

‘I wanted to be there to make him watch me - as he’d made me watch him - as I told the court all the sick things he’d done,’ Debbie says.

The jury returned a unanimous verdict and Patrick was found guilty of four rapes, two attempted rapes and 7 counts of indecent assault against the sisters, and sentenced to 12 years.

Debbie says: ‘He shouted and swore at me as he was led down.  But finally we'd got justice.

‘Now Laraine and I want to start again. We owe it to ourselves and our families.  And I know one day soon, now it’s all over my little sis will be properly back up on her feet again.

Laraine says: ‘I didn't speak about the abuse for years because he made me feel ashamed. I almost drank myself to death to blot out what he’d done but Debbie and my family made me see sense just in time.

‘I know now none of it was my fault and I want to make up for all those lost years, start living again

'Me and Debbie are living poof that justice can be done even years after.  So if you're living under the shadow we lived under, tell someone. Speak out.  It will be hard, but you wont' regret it.'
