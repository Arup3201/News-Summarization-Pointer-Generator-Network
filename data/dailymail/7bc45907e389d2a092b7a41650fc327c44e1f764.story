A letter which was written by a Stanford School of Business graduate and handed down to first-year students as a frank survival guide for 25 years has been unearthed.

The candid six-page confessional was written at some point during the late 80s by Shirzad Bozorgchami - now a California-based author and CEO - and offers MBA students the sort of sage advice that is applicable to many walks of life.

'You don’t need to be in a study group, you don’t need to turn in every homework, you don’t have to appear bubbly and social all the time,' the letter states. 'You don’t have to interview with investment banks and consultants, you don’t need to be conservative and safe in class discussions.'

Mr Bozorgchami, who grew up in a turbulent, emotionally abusive home in Iran and was highly intimidated when he first joined the esteemed Stanford GSB, penned the letter to reassure and encourage his fellow students.

'This note reflects my personal thoughts, feelings and suggestions for a more fulfilling GSB life,' he wrote.

Top of the list was Mr Bozorgchami's suggestion to embrace moderation when it came to studying. 'I could never understand why some people would spend hours on putting the finishing touches on a report, when the act involved very little additional learning.

'Neurotic perfectionism at its worst,' he wrote, adding that the sooner this habit is broken 'the happier you'll be.'

He also advised that rather than 'carefully reading an article,' students would do better to 'skim-read' three of them, and socialize a little with the time saved pouring over books.

'You often only need to know about half the material covered,' he revealed.

'If you work hard because... you are 
afraid of not passing, because an ugly monster in your nightmares keeps 
reminding you that the world will come to an end if you don't pass, you 
can easily resent the experience and find it painful.'

The 
illuminating letter also placed a strong emphasis on getting to know 
classmates, avoiding the harsh judgement of others, and generally being a
 pleasant human being; which Mr  Bozorgchami points out is far more 
likely to lead to later success than getting the best grades.

'By 
actively judging people positively, you are exposing yourself to being 
hurt a little by a jerk,' he conceded. 'But that is a small price to pay
 to get to know many more wonderful people that you wouldn't otherwise 
take the chance on.

'We really are a bunch of very nice people here, only most of us are afraid to show it openly.'

Elite: The letter unwittingly became something of a manifesto, and is allegedly still in circulation among new students at Stanford GSB (pictured) and other schools around the country

Following the letter, Mr Bozorgchami has since claimed he received an unexpected flood of thank-you responses from students who were helped or comforted by his words.

It thus unwittingly became something of a manifesto, and is allegedly still in circulation among new students at Stanford GSB, and other schools around the country.

Four years after he first wrote the letter, Mr Bozorgchami followed it up with an epilogue, stating: 'I am deeply moved that this letter has become a traditional gift from the second year class to the first years in the weekend before midterms.'

Written in 1991, it included lessons he had further learned since leaving GSB - 'a very unusual place, with extremely high standards' - and joined the real business world.

'You often only need to know about half the material covered'

'No one has once asked me about my grades since graduation,' he wrote.

'The more lasting impact of the GSB for me... has been the soft rather than hard skills of management and the resulting relationships.'

Mr Bozorgchami, who published a motivational book called Positive Intelligence in 2012, concluded his wisdom-packed manuscript with one last kernel of advice.

'Not one on his/her deathbed has been known to say "I wish I had calculated a few more NPVs [Net Present Values]."

'Some have been known to wish they had taken a few more chances, loved a few more people, touched a few more lives, fought for a few more causes, caused a few more smiles.'
