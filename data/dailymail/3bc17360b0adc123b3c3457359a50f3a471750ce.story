A man and woman in Florida are lucky to be alive after they fell asleep in a dumpster while intoxicated and had to be rescued after it was later emptied into a garbage truck.

Hillsborough County Sheriff's officials say the couple had been sleeping in a dumpster outside a Wawa gas station near Tampa early on Wednesday.

When the dumpster was emptied into the back of a Progressive Waste Solutions garbage truck, they started screaming and banging on the sides of the truck.

'I was picking up some containers,' driver Radmas Valasquez told cops, reports The Smoking Gun. 'I got two people, I don’t know how they got in the back of the truck. But they stuck in the truck.' 

Valasquez said he was due to compact the trash when he heard the screams from inside the truck. 'I almost killed both of them,' he said.

Rescue crews had to be called about 5 a.m. after the driver was unable to remove 37-year-old Donald L. Jordan and 49-year-old Lisa Spirella from the truck. 

Police believe the couple - who are from KIssimmee, some 75 miles away - got highly intoxicated while visiting the nearby Seminole Hard Rock & Casino and decided to take a nap in the dumpster.

They were taken to Tampa General Hospital after complaining of back pain.

'It was originally believed that they were homeless, but it seems they were just really intoxicated after hanging out at the casino,' said a HCSO spokesperson.

According to court records in Kissimmee, the pair have been arrested several times each in recent years.

Sirabella’s rap sheet includes arrests for loitering, theft, battery, resisting arrest, and drunk driving. 

Jordan has been busted for cocaine possession, loitering, trespass, panhandling, drinking in public, battery, and disorderly conduct.
