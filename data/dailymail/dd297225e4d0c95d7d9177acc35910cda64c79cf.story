In February he brought us fast food fashion and it seems that in his second season at the helm of Moschino, Jeremy Scott hasn't run out of creative ideas.

The creative head, who is famed for making kitsch cool, sent his models down the runway in Milan in Barbie doll inspired dresses to the sound of Aqua's iconic 90s hit, I'm A Barbie Girl.

The show was opened by a doll dressed exactly the same as the plastic one gifted to audience members and each new model followed suit. In short; a collection that screams Rita Ora.

I'm a Barbie girl! Jeremy Scott, in his second season as creative head for Moschino, put on a super fun, Barbie-inspired show in Milan last night

There was business woman Barbie, kitted out in an embellished pink suit, work out Barbie, in a sports luxe tracksuit (in pink, of course) and cowgirl Barbie in glitzy rodeo attire. 

Popular model Charlotte Free took on the role of roller-skating Barbie and skated along the catwalk in a bra, tracksuit bottoms, and sweatband, emblazoned with the doll's iconic logo.

Take your pick: There was sporty Barbie, left, in a branded tracksuit carrying weights, as well as cowgirl Barbie, right, who rocked a rodeo style

One for Rita Ora? The loud and proud designs in vibrant hues of pink, yellow and turquoise wouldn't be out of place in Miss Ora's wardrobe

It's time to think pink: Speaking about his inspiration, Scott said he loved Barbie growing up, adding: 'It's hard not to; she's practically perfect'

Elle Woods, is that you? With their blode wigs and head-to-toe pink outfits, Scott's models resembled Reese Witherspoon's character in Legally Blonde

Remember last season's sought-after McDonalds fries Iphone holder? In six months time Moschino's new bubblegum pink Disney-style hand mirror that doubles as a phone case will be every fashionista's phone case of choice. 

Accessories too were a throwback to the 90s, with bubble backpacks dominating and chunky gold necklaces and belts adorning model's limbs. 

Speaking to Style.com about the show, Scott explained: 'Like every girl and gay boy, I loved Barbie.

'It's hard not to; she's practically perfect. She's a good big sister, she's had every job in the world, worn every outfit. And it's just joyful. Her and I share the same things: We just want to bring joy to people.'

If Scott has his way, we all really will be Barbie girls in a Barbie world. 

It wasn't all pink! Scott included daring gold corsets and hotpants, left, as well as vibrant blue cocktail dresses with voluminous sleeves
