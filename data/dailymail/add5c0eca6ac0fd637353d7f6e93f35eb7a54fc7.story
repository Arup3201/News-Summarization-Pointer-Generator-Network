Hundreds of students turned out for a memorial to mourn an Oklahoma cheerleader, 17, who was killed in a car crash over the weekend.

Mallory Brooke Winegarten, 17, died on Sunday at Saint Francis Hospital in Tulsa after the Friday morning crash, which happened at the entrance road to her house.

Around 400 students mourned the Skiatook High School senior on Monday by wearing purple, her favourite colour.

‘She was an excellent student who made very good grades,’ Principal Will Parker told Tulsa World.

‘She was one of those kids that every teacher dreamed of having in class. She had a bright smile, vivacious, smart.’

Winegarten was driving eastbound on Oklahoma 20 in a 2010 Lexus about 9 am on Friday, according to Collinsville Police Capt. Daniel Boggs.

As she tried to turn left into her 
housing addition near North 59th East Avenue, her car was struck by a 
westbound 2009 Chevrolet pickup driven by Kimberly Ann Wimmer, 51, of 
Skiatook, Boggs told Tulsa World.

Both drivers were taken to Tulsa-area hospitals. Wimmer has been released, he said. The crash is still under investigation.

The memorial on Monday was a sad affair.

Grief counselors were on hand at the high school to help students deal with the loss.

'There were a lot of tears and a lot of condolences,' Parker said. 'Kids were very comforting to one another, and teachers were, as well.'

He said the school was 'very sad' on behalf of her family and friends 'who love and miss her'.

'We are also very proud of our community for their incredible support of our kids and one another. It’s great to be from Skiatook,' said Parker.
