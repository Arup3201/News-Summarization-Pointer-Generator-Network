In 1988, when Arsene Wenger was getting in his stride as Monaco manager, he revealed in an interview with a local newspaper that he did a master's degree in economics because it gave him a 'way to understand what was going on around me'.

The 65-year-old must now wrap his head around how Arsenal were eliminated from the Champions League in the last 16 for the fifth year running, despite a 2-0 win against his former club that left it 3-3 on aggregate. 

Wenger's return to Monaco was not as romantic as he would have liked as no banners were unfurled at the Stade Louis II and few pleasantries were exchanged during a match that saw Arsenal win the battle, but lose the war.

Arsenal's exit on away goals means Wenger must now  focus on qualifying for next year's competition and little can be made in mitigation for being denied a place in the quarter-finals by a team sitting fourth in Ligue 1.

'We have gone out in the last 16 in the last four years, but twice against the future winners,' Wenger said ahead of the match, though it would take some doing for Leonardo Jardim's Monaco to become the third eventual European champions to boot Arsenal out.

Wenger is sure to analyse his team's exit and it was in that same interview with Monaco-Matin some 27 years ago that he revealed his habit for making sure he watches at least half an hour of football every evening, among other interests.

'I read a lot, all sorts of books because you have to be conversant in a larger and larger amount of things,' the then-Monaco manager  said in 1988. 

'For example, I follow closely what is being released in the book store, be it in French, in German or in English. I take notes by hand. I do not know how to type. I have watched a lot of matches. 

'This is part of continuing to grow [as a manager]. You take a step back from your football and you analyse the practices elsewhere. 

'I have at least 250 [video cassettes]. Every evening, at home, I watch a game for about half an hour. Often, it is the opponent that we are about to play, sometimes, it is just for enjoyment. Bayern [Munich] vs Real [Madrid] for example.' 

Watching this match will not make for pleasant viewing for Wenger, however, as his first competitive return to a city famous for its casino and where one in three people are millionaires saw Arsenal leave empty-handed.
