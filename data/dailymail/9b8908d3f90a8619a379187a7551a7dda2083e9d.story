Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick was left bemused after claiming he heard the referee’s whistle in the build-up to Liverpool’s second goal.

Liverpool midfielder Lazar Markovic played the ball through to team-mate Philippe Coutinho, marked by Elphick, in the Bournemouth penalty area.

But a whistle, which appeared to come from the home supporters, seemed to confuse Elphick.

The Bournemouth skipper stopped, and turned his back, on Coutinho, allowing the Brazilian to get his shot away on goal.

The effort was blocked but fell to Markovic who slotted home with 27 minutes gone.

A distraught Elphick appeared to say: ‘I heard a whistle’ when Markovic wheeled away in celebration to double Liverpool’s advantage in the Capital One Cup quarter-final.

Raheem Sterling gave the under-pressure visitors the lead when he headed home an impressive 51-pass Liverpool move. He then scored his second of the night shortly after the interval.
