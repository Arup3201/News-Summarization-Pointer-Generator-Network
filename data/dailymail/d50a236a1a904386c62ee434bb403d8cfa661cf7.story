The latest advertising campaign from Marks & Spencer has been billed as a ‘celebration of women’. But according to one critic, it’s sailing under false colours.

Academic Mary Beard has accused the retailer of being unrealistic by failing to include any women with grey hair.

The television historian – who famously eschews hair dye and make-up – complained that there was not so much as a ‘whiff of grey’ in the high-profile promotion.

Academic Mary Beard has criticised M&S for not including a grey-haired woman in the line-up that features (left to right) Katie Piper, Nicola Adams, Tracey Emin, Ellie Goulding, Helen Allen, Monica Ali, Grace Coddington, Dame Helen Mirren, Laura Mvula and Karen Elson

The campaign, which store bosses hope will revive struggling sales, features 12 famous faces described as ‘Britain’s leading ladies’. It was shot by fashion photographer Annie Leibovitz, with one portrait alone costing upwards of £100,000.

However, Professor Beard, 58, wrote to  her 50,000 followers on Twitter:  ‘Women in new M&S ad are a great and feisty bunch. But unless I have mistaken [Helen] Mirren’s blonde, don’t spot a whiff of grey. Women go grey M&S!’

The adverts, which have been described by the store as a way to illustrate its ‘move into a new era’, feature only two women over 60 – Oscar-winning actress Dame Helen, 68, and 72-year-old Grace Coddington, creative director of US Vogue. Neither appears to have grey hair in the pictures.

Last night customers took to Twitter to support Professor Beard in her criticism of M&S. ‘Shame on them. I am grey and proud,’ wrote one.

‘Women go grey? Shock horror… I just thought my mirror had gone a bit weird,’ joked another.

One added sarcastically: ‘Three things a woman must NEVER do: gain weight, go grey and turn 50!’

‘Think it is the worst line-up I have ever seen. Enough to keep me out of M & S for ever,’ another woman wrote.

M&S chiefs hope the campaign will boost sales of its autumn/winter fashion range, which is seen as make-or-break for the store after two years of declining sales.

But there has already been criticism of the women it has chosen, with many questioning whether controversial artist Tracey Emin is an appropriate ambassador for the respectable brand considering her party-loving past. One customer wrote on Twitter: ‘Is this a joke?’

Others selected for the campaign include Olympic gold medal winning boxer Nicola Adams, ballerina Darcey Bussell, Save the Children chief executive Jasmine Whitbread  and novelist Monica Ali.

It also features former nurse of the year Helen Allen, acid attack survivor Katie Piper, model Karen Elson and singers Ellie Goulding and Laura Mvula.

Mary Beard said the line-up was a 'feisty bunch' but wanted to see more grey, saying that she thought Helen Mirren (centre, seated in red jacket) was blonde in the shoot

M&S say the new line-up and collection is a 'womanist campaign... designed to celebrate women'

It marks a departure from the store’s previous adverts starring household names such as Twiggy and Dannii Minogue.

M&S has claimed it is a ‘womanist campaign … designed to celebrate women. To whom clothes are presumably important’.

Professor Beard, who lectures  in classics at Cambridge University, has refused to alter her style  since she found fame presenting BBC programmes such as Meet  the Romans.

Last year she wrote in the Mail: ‘Sure, I don’t wear make-up. I have nothing against those who do if it gives them pleasure, but actually I feel happy enough in my own skin not to feel I want to bother with it.

‘I don’t dye my hair for the same reason. I ask myself: “If I did, what would I be covering up?” And how do you stop doing it once you’ve started?’

Professor Beard has been the target of online trolls who have criticised her looks and earlier this month she received a bomb threat on Twitter.

Last night M&S disputed her accusation that there were no women with grey hair included in the campaign.

A spokesman said: ‘No, we won’t comment. Helen has grey hair so we will have to agree to differ on that.’

The advertising campaign  comes as M&S faces pressure to revive its fortunes following eight consecutive quarters of declining clothing sales.

Customers complained that levels of quality had fallen and that the store no longer sold clothes they actually wanted to wear.

However, it has recently bolstered its fashion team with recruits such as style director Belinda Earl, former chief executive of Jaeger.
