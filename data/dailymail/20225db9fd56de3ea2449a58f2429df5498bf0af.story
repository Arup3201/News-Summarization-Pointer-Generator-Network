Nissan has unveiled the world's fastest electric racing car that can reach speeds of more than 185mph - twice the speed of current electric road cars.

The Zero Emission On Demand Racing Car - ZEOD RC - is fitted with modified versions of the electric technology used in the UK car maker's LEAF model.

The ZEOD RC will make its race debut at next year's Le Mans 24 Hour event in France.

Nissan has unveiled the world's fastest electric car - the Zero Emission On Demand Racing Car. ZEOD RC for short, the car can reach speeds of up to 185mph and will make its race debut at next year's Le Mans 24 hours event in France

The ZEOD RC will compete under the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's 'Garage 56' entry at the 2014 Le Mans event - an additional spot on the grid especially for vehicles that showcase innovative technology

The technology in Nissan's ZEOD RC car builds upon its electric designs in its Leaf model.

Leaf stands for Leading, Environmentally friendly, Affordable, Family.

It uses an 80 kW and 280 N-m front-mounted electric motor that drives the front axle, powered by a 24 kilowatt-hours lithium ion battery pack.

This system is designed to create up to 90 kilowatts (120 hp) power.

The current Leaf model can reach speeds of up to 93 mph and it goes from zero to 60 mph in 9.9 seconds.

The battery pack is designed to retain 70 to 80 per cent of its capacity for 10 years.

The Leaf also has an auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery that powers the car computer systems including the radio, headlights and windshield wipers.

A U.S version also has a small solar panel on the rear spoiler.

Nissan unveiled the car to fans ahead of this weekend's Le Mans 24 Hour race.

The car will compete under the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's 'Garage 56' 
entry - an additional spot on the grid for vehicles that showcase new 
and innovative technology.

Nissan plans to test various types of engine and electric technologies in the new car over the next year to increase its performance for the race.

These trials will then be used to create technology for future electric road cars.

Nissan said it will showcase these developments as they happen on its YouTube channel and Nismo.TV.

The ZEOD RC design team was headed by Ben Bowlby who was recently appointed as Nissan's Director of Motorsport Innovation.

The technology in Nissan's ZEOD RC is a modified version of the electric engine used in its LEAF road car. The LEAF reaches top speeds of around 93mph while the ZEOD RC can achieve 185mph

Bowley said: 'The Nissan ZEOD RC is a natural progression that follows on from the development of the Nissan LEAF road car and the LEAF RC race car prototype.

'The technologies developed through the program will form part of future innovations for road cars.

'The program is designed to develop multiple technologies to evaluate how they could be used for a future return of Nissan at Le Mans. We are investigating multiple options.

The ZEOD RC model unveiled ahead of this weekend's Le Mans race is a prototype. Nissan plans to test various types of engine and electric technologies in the new car over the next year to increase its performance for the race

An ZEOD RC driver can to switch between electric and petrol-powered drive. Nissan's design team claim that this a technology that could be added to road cars in the future in addition to pure electric power

'A Zero Emission On Demand option - where the driver can switch between electric and petrol-powered drive - is a future direction for road cars, so that will be tested in addition to pure electric power and other new technologies.'

While current battery technology doesn't provide the energy storage capacity to race a solely electric Le Mans prototype, Bowlby believes the development of the car will be an important step in the 'electrification' of motorsport.

'A car like this provides an incredibly challenging test bed for what could be highly-effective options for road cars. Throughout the next year we will be testing multiple drive trains in an extensive test program,' Bowlby said.

Nissan's cars currently don't have the energy storage capacity to race a solely electric Le Mans prototype but its designer Ben Bowlby wants to change this during the trials. He believes the development of the car will be an important step in the 'electrification' of motorsport

'Nissan is a leader in electric vehicle 
technology for the road, now we want to take those lessons learnt and 
utilize that knowledge base in the development of the new race car.'

Launched in 2010, the Nissan LEAF has become the world's best-selling all-electric car.

Nissan launched the Nissan LEAF RC in 2011 - a race car powered by the same 107-hp electric motor that is used in the road car.

The LEAF RC uses Leafâ€™s lithium-ion battery pack and 80-kW, 107 horse power motor.
