Hundreds of NHS websites have huge security flaws that could see them taken over or defaced by hackers.

During investigations, more than 2,000 vulnerabilities have been found, with experts warning criminals could use these flaws to easily infect people’s computers and steal their personal information.

There are said to be around 5,000 NHS domains - covering everything from GPs' surgeries to sites that help people give up smoking or offer advice on breastfeeding.

However, because there’s no central body responsible for the security and maintenance of these sites, many are abandoned, making them easy prey for hackers.

More than 2,000 vulnerabilities have been found during a Computer Active investigation into NHS websites. There are around 5,000 NHS domains, but because there's no central body responsible for the security and maintenance of these sites, many are abandoned making them easy prey for hackers

The majority of these flaws are caused by outdated versions of WordPress.

Around 400 ‘.nhs.uk’ websites run WordPress - a popular website-building tool - but fewer than 50 of these use the latest, most secure version. Five NHS websites run a version of WordPress that was last updated in 2008.

Outdated versions of WordPress are constantly targeted by hackers. In September 2013, security experts estimated 70 per cent of all websites running WordPress were vulnerable.

In addition to old versions of WordPress, many of the NHS sites run outdated plug-ins.

The vast majority of these websites also use unsecured administrator login pages.

This means that when a website 
administrator logs in, their username and password are sent without 
encryption, making them vulnerable to interception by a hacker, who 
could gain complete control of the site.

Terence Eden, an independent 
security researcher uncovered the flaws and has informed the NHS.

He likened the situation to someone 'walking past a house and seeing a wide
 open window.

'An attacker 
could use the site to host viruses - or automatically redirect users to 
convincing-looking fake sites.

An attacker could also change the site to
 look like the NHS is endorsing and selling dodgy pills and potions,' 
Eden explained.

Eden said that bugs on old versions of
 WordPress could also let criminals steal passwords and other personal 
information, which in turn could compromise the integrity of the NHS.

'If
 people are not able to trust the information present on their local 
hospital’s website, they are less likely to trust the NHS.'

Is visiting NHS sites going to infect my computer?

Any website could be compromised by hackers, but poorly coded websites running outdated and vulnerable code are easy targets. At
 the moment hackers aren’t targeting these NHS websites - but the 
security flaws uncovered show that they would be alarmingly easy to 
attack.

Is it dangerous for me to visit any WordPress site?Absolutely
 not. In the same way you’d keep software on your PC updated, a 
website’s security also needs to be kept up to scratch to protect it 
against attack.

WordPress is a popular tool for building attractive and 
easy-to- use websites, with nearly 76 million sites using it.

Why are old versions of WordPress so vulnerable?Just
 as you keep software on your computer up to date, websites also need 
regular updates to keep them safe. This is where some NHS websites have 
failed.

Of the 5,000 or so websites using the ‘.nhs.uk’ domain about 400
 of them run WordPress. What’s worrying is that fewer than 50 are 
running the latest version, WordPress 3.8.1.

Even more alarmingly, some 
sites – such as a stop smoking advice website for Somerset NHS – are 
running versions of WordPress that were released in August 2008. You 
wouldn’t run a computer that was last updated five years ago - the same 
applies to websites.

What is ‘cross-site scripting’ and why is it dangerous?Also
 known as XSS, cross-site scripting allows a hacker to exploit the ‘user
 input’ part of a website, such as a search box, to run malicious code.

This vulnerability means anyone with the right know-how can make images,
 links, text or video appear on a website. By doing this a hacker could 
add anything they wanted to an NHS website. Most websites block this 
code from running, but poorly designed websites don’t.

One
 NHS website, which offers advice on breastfeeding, contains a 
cross-site scripting vulnerability that lets anyone add their own 
images, videos, text and links to pages.

To
 demonstrate this, Eden added a video of a bear fishing for 
salmon to this NHS webpage. In the hands of a criminal this could easily 
be a pornographic video or link to a malicious website that steals your 
personal information and infects your computer.

Since Eden hacked this site, Liverpool city council’s Public Health department, which has responsibility for it, has fixed the issue and said it is 'satisfied the site is now secure.'

In another example, Eden showed that a website about improving the quality of NHS leadership and patient care could easily be altered to contain links to websites selling fake sexual aids.

The majority of the flaws are caused by outdated versions of WordPress. Around 400 '.nhs.uk' websites run WordPress but fewer than 50 of these use the latest, most secure version. Five NHS websites, including this stop smoking service from Somerset NHS, run a version of WordPress last updated in 2008

The Health and Social Care Information
 Centre (HSCIC), which processes applications for ‘.nhs.uk’ domain 
names, said that responsibility for upkeep lay 'with the organisation 
running each website or service.'

After being made aware of the security
 flaws HSCIC said it was 'drafting some additional guidance' that will 
be issued to anyone using an NHS domain. Despite this, nearly all the flaws highlighted are still present and exploitable.

In 
most cases, GP surgeries and local NHS bodies outsource the development 
of their websites to specialist private companies, with many seemingly 
never updated.

Bill Douglas, head of Applications at the Cheshire and Merseyside Commissioning Support Unit, explained that while the main NHS Choices website is maintained by a central IT team, local websites merely had to follow 'some general guidelines.'

To demonstrate the flaw, security researcher Terence Eden added a video of a bear fishing for salmon to an NHS webpage, pictured. Liverpool city council's Public Health department has now fixed the issue on this site and said it is 'satisfied the site is secure'

One software company, responsible for 
the development of 'many hundreds' of NHS websites for GP surgeries, added that once a website had been developed it was the surgery’s 
responsibility to keep it updated.

Computer Active also found a number of security flaws in many of the company’s NHS 
websites that left them vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack via 
HTML injection.

This can make it easy for hackers to change how a site 
looks by adding their own images, videos, text and links. This flaw has 
now been fixed.

Simon Edwards, head of Dennis Technology Labs said that because people are more likely to trust NHS websites, they were a very attractive target for criminals.

'The old advice about avoiding pornographic websites, cracked software and other dubious parts of the internet still holds, but threats are not limited to these places,' he warned.

'When we test security software it’s common to find that the malicious software is stored and downloaded from innocent websites that have been hacked.'
