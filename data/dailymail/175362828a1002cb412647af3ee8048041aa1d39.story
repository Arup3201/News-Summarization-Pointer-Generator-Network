A Florida woman has been charged with abuse after her disabled husband was found covered in maggots with wounds that were bone deep.

Paramedics found Sharon Tillman's husband Greg living in his own excrement with severe body sores covering his body.

He weighed just 90lbs and had open wounds that were so severe that parts of his bone were exposed.

Investigators said he became bedridden in January after suffering a bad reaction to a spider bite.

Sharon, 48, failed to seek any medical attention and instead allegedly allowed him to rot away in his bed with flesh eating maggots attacking his body.

One investigators stated that one of his leg wounds had been open down to the bone for so long that 'the bone was dry and skin was not growing over it.'

Tillman was found at the home he shared in Pinellas Park, Florida, with his wife.

Photos on the couple's Facebook page show the couple smiling and happy together.

But investigators who visited the home said Tillman had been left in increasingly dire conditions after becoming ill.

Police who visited the home said in an arrest report they were met by an overpowering stench of urine.

Outside the home were piles of trash, urine collection bags and soiled gauze. There were also milk bottles filled with liquid.

Conditions inside the home were no better with trash spread across all the rooms.

'We found medical injuries not from physical abuse, but from a lack of medical attention, and lack of care-giving by the victim's wife,' said Pinellas Park Police public information officer Brian Unmasieg.

Neighbors told WTSP TV that they often wondered why they never saw Mr Tillman.

'I used to see him outside cutting his grass, and then nothing,' said neighbor Anthony Leverso.

'Sharron was always nice, so I never thought anything of it. I thought maybe they split up, or he moved away.'

'She used to come over and ask for things like butter or eggs or money. We always tried to help out because we knew they had fallen on hard times, but I never knew anything like that was going on across the street from my house,' said neighbor Tommy DiTommaso.

Tillman was charged with abuse/neglect of a disabled person and is being held in Pinellas County jail.

Authorities said her husband is expected to make a full recovery.
