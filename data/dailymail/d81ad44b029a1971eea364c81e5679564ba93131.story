A police officer posed his newborn baby daughter enjoying a snooze - in his helmet.

PC Andy Ross popped four-day-old Isla in the hat and he admits the beauty of the photo made him emotional.

Andy, who has been a policeman for West Midlands Police for six years, also has an 18-month-old son.

Taking a nap: PC Andy Ross popped four-day-old Isla into his police helmet, where she carried on sleeping

As the youngster snoozed the helmet was propped up by several cans of beans and she was placed in the blanket while she had an afternoon nap.

He said: 'It represents my job and my family. I loved it, it brought a tear to my eye.

'I don’t know where the idea came from really. I was going to do a photoshoot and the photographer told me I should bring any personal props that I wanted.

Her favourite place: Isla back in the hard hat where she likes to nap

'So I just grabbed some of my uniform and took it with me to the photoshoot.

'That one picture took about half an hour to do, we had to lay Isla down and make sure she fell asleep before we could put her gently in the helmet to take the picture.

'We had to spend some time layering up some cans of beans in order to make sure the helmet would stay up.

'The problem is it isn’t a flat helmet, and it’s asymmetrical so it took a little while to get the balance right.

Happy family: Andy Ross from Bedworth, Warwickshire with Isla, son Finley, and wife Sarah

'But the photo that came out is just wonderful. I have always loved my job and I love her so much, so you add the two together and it looks great.

'I have had a great career in the police force, I will support her in whatever she wants to do when she grows up as long as she is happy.

'If she also wants to be a police officer, I will support that, as long as it makes her happy.'

The officer, from Warwickshire, had the photo taken last March by photographer Bethany Anne Smith in her studio in Bedworth.
