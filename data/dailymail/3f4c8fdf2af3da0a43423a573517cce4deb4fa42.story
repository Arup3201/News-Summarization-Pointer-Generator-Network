During a press conference yesterday, President Obama revealed the existence of a sealed indictment in the Benghazi attacks in Libya on September 11, 2012, leaving some experts questioning whether the president broke the law.

Federal law states that 'no person may disclose [a sealed] 
indictment's existence,' and that doing so may be 'punished as a
contempt of court,' a charge that carries a minimum sentence of six months prison.

The announcement came as a surprise to some insiders, as the existence 
of a sealed indictment has not been publicly confirmed or denied by law 
enforcement or government officials.

The president did not name anyone or divulge the number of suspects.

President Obama held the press conference before he takes off on holiday with his family to Martha's Vineyard.

A reporter asked the president whether the perpetrators of the 2012 Benghazi, Libya attack that left four Americans dead would be brought to justice.

President Obama responded, 'We have informed, I think, the public that there's a sealed indictment. It's sealed for a reason. But we are intent on capturing those who carried out this attack, and we're going to stay on it until we get them.'

Signed, sealed, delivered: Speculation has been mounting about the sealed indictment, but no one would confirm or deny their existence until President Obama's revelations yesterday

That the first charges had been filed in the Benghazi case was widely reported, but repeatedly denied by administration and intelligence officials.

An official, speaking to ABC News on the condition of anonymity, labelled the revelation 'crazy', and joked,

'Doesn't the law apply to the President too? I guess he could pardon himself.'

But you don't get to be leader of the free world without a few perks - one of which is being immune from non-disclosure or confidentiality laws.

Terrorism: Of the 2012 Benghazi attack perpetrators, Mr Obama said he would pursue them 'until we get them'

According to a former lawyer for Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, by virtue of his position, leaking classified information turns it into authorized information.

Peter Zeidenberg told ABC News, 'Nothing he says is technically a leak. If he does it, it is authorized.'

However, had any other official mentioned the existence of the indictment, they would have been guilty of contempt of court.

Zeidenberg said that it is, however, possible to form an argument that a sealed matter can only be unsealed by a court.

White House officials told ABC News that the President was only 'referencing widely reported information and was not asked about, nor did he comment on any specific indictment.'
