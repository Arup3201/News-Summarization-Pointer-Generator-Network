The police officer who a New York grand jury chose not to indict in the death of Eric Garner has spoken out to reveal the pain he feels in the wake of the 43-year-old father of six's death.

'It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner,' Pantaleo said in a statement at the heels of Wednesday's decision. 'My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss.'

Pantaleo had been stripped of his gun and badge and will remain on desk duty pending an internal police investigation that could result in administrative charges.

Police union officials and Pantaleo's lawyer argued that the officer used a takedown move taught by the police department, not a banned maneuver, because Garner was resisting arrest.

They said his poor health was the main reason he died. 

The Justice Department is investigating whether Brown's civil rights were violated through excessive force.

As the grand jury decision drew near, police officials met with community leaders on Staten Island to head off the kind of violence seen in Ferguson, where a grand jury decided not to indict the white officer who shot the black teen. 

Demonstrations there resulted in more than 100 arrests and destruction of 12 commercial buildings by fire.

It is rare for either federal or state prosecutors to charge a U.S. police officer for excessive force, even when a death results.

The U.S. Supreme Court and lower courts have over decades ruled that police officers should have wide latitude to use violence to defend themselves and to take suspects into custody.

'There are a lot of cases where police officers don't get indicted for what looks like extreme situations,' said Aaron Mysliwiec, president of the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. 'Many jurors and judges tend to believe police officers more than your average witness.'

In ruling Garner's death a homicide, the city medical examiner said police officers killed him by compressing his neck and chest. His health problems, including asthma and obesity, were contributing factors, the medical examiner said.

The video of Garner's arrest shows him arguing with police officers, saying, 'Please leave me alone,' and later, 'Don't touch me,' before a group of four officers tackled him to the ground. He then began to plead with them, saying repeatedly, 'I can't breathe.' Police said later that Garner had been resisting arrest. 

The official was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio separately said he had been told by Justice Department officials that the federal investigation into the death will now move forward.
