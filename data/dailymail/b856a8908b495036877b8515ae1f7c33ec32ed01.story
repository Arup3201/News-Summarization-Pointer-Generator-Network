It was recently a breeding ground for academy hopefuls, an extension of reserve-team football where teenagers would share a park with the stiffs.

For around the turn of the Millennium and even in the years which followed, the League Cup lost its identity and appeal.

The Champions League had just expanded to include two group stages and the Premier League had three participants, soon to be four.

2005: Chelsea (beat Liverpool) 

2006: Manchester United (beat Wigan)

2007: Chelsea (beat Arsenal)

2008: Tottenham (beat Chelsea)

2009: Manchester United (beat Tottenham)

2010: Manchester United (beat Aston Villa)

2011: Birmingham City (beat Arsenal) 

2012: Liverpool (beat Cardiff City)

2013: Swansea City (beat Bradford City)

2014: Manchester City (beat Sunderland) 

It was the League Cup which suffered. How many of us remember the 2000 final between Leicester and Tranmere in which the Foxes won 2-1? Matt Elliott scored twice to win it for Martin O’Neill’s side and it was actually a decent game.

But interest in the competition had faded – the other semi-finalists had been Bolton and Aston Villa, no sign of the big boys, and that’s exactly how they wanted it.

Arsenal exited to Middlesbrough that year with a team which included Tommy Black, Paolo Vernazza and Stefan Malz.

Manchester United made an equally hasty departure at Villa, Michael Twiss, Michael Clegg and Ronnie Wallwork among the losing side.

Even a decade on teams were rotated right through the competition. When United beat Villa in the final of 2010, Sir Alex Ferguson fielded what amounted to a second XI, Tomasz Kuszczak in goal and Michael Owen leading the line.

But those days, it seems, have gone. The League Cup has been elevated in importance, capturing with it the imagination of supporters and the wider viewing public.

Chelsea and Liverpool played out their semi-final with full-strength sides in front of a capacity crowd this week, likewise Spurs and Sheffield United. Indeed, some players were rested for Premier League fixtures to preserve legs and lungs for the cup tie.

Yes, teams are still shuffled in the earlier rounds, but not to the extent of Malz and Twiss. Chelsea won at Shrewsbury in the fourth round and included Gary Cahill, Andre Schurrle, Oscar and Didier Drogba, while Eden Hazard, Nemanja Matic and Willian were called on from the bench.

Jose Mourinho has never underplayed the significance of his first trophy on these shores – the 2005 League Cup victory over Liverpool – and from that day there has been a slow sea change in attitude towards the competition.

Look at the last 10 winners, Swansea and Birmingham apart, the victors have all resided in the upper tier of the Premier League.

Two of those past champions – Chelsea and Spurs - will contest this year’s final. And there, in front of a sold-out Wembley on March 1, they will field their best XIs.

The League Cup was the first competition Jose Mourinho won as Chelsea manager

So why the lure of this once poor relation? It cannot be the Europa League prize, for that is now the inconvenience the League Cup once was.

Rather, it is more the realisation that Wembley finals – and the joy they bring to players and supporters – are only open to four teams each season. Bigger clubs allowed themselves to be blinded by the Champions League – and, to an extent, still are – but it is almost as if the League Cup has offered light relief from the cash-driven chase for the continent’s premier prize.

The dates help, too. Before fatigue kicks in post New Year, the competition has already found its last four teams. There was something exciting about the pre-Christmas round of quarter-final matches, the appeal of knock-out football amid the regularity of the league calendar and increasing irrelevance of the Champions League group phase.

Irrelevant, however, is not a word you would use to describe the League Cup. Not anymore, at least.
