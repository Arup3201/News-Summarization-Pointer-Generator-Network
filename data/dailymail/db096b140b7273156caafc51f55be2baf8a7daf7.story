An adorable puppy was rescued from a hot vehicle by a passer by who then bought the animal on the spot.

Ex-Dallas Cowboys coach Barry Switzer noticed the small Rottweiler because he thought it was 'beautiful'.

The cute pup caught the eye of Mr Switzer when he was on his way into a store and he stopped to watch the dog, which was on leash in the back of a van.

Adorable: The floppy Rottweiler puppy was bought by Barry Switzer from its owners after he saw it had been left in the back of a van on a hot day

Soft spot: The ex-Cowboys coach, who has a soft spot for animals, took the puppy straight to the vets and had it completely checked over and given various jabs

While the windows of the van were open, he toldÂ KFOR.com that it was a very hot day.

He said: 'I noticed there was a beautiful dog and I saw it was a puppy, so I sat there and watched it, and it was awful hot.'

He decided to wait for the owners to return then bought the adorable creature, named Sassy, there and then.

Mr Switzer, who has several dogs of his own, then took the pup to a vet and asked for her to be completely checked over, given rabies and worms jabs and even had her nails clipped.

Companions: Mr Switzer tweeted this picture of himself with his new puppy but sadly he won't be able to keep the dog

The big-eyed puppy has quickly become a favourite addition to the Switzer household, entertaining German Shepherd Sieger with her playing. He has also renamed the dog Stella.

But Mr Switzer, who was head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners and the Dallas Cowboys, said sadly he can't keep the puppy because he already has so many dogs.

The ex-football coach said he wanted to find a good home for the cute puppy, and has now found a couple who lost their home in the Moore tornado

He told the news service he wanted to find a good home for Stella, people who would take good care of her.

And already he has found just the people - an Oklahoma couple who lost their home in the Moore tornado. The arrival of Stella will also coincide with their wedding anniversary.
