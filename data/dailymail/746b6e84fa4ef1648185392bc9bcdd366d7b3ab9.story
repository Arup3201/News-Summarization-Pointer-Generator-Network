A Nazi sympathiser suspected of committing an arson attack that killed three members of his own family has surrendered after holding his girlfriend and her baby hostage.

Ex-con Matthew Slocum, 23, who has tattoos of swastikas on his arms, sparked an Amber Alert in three states when he went on the run following the tragic inferno in White Creek, New York.

He is accused of triggering the blaze which is thought to have taken the lives of his mother Lisa Harrington, her police officer husband Dan and his son Josh at the house he shared with them.

Although detectives are also investigating whether Slocum shot dead all three before torching the property.

Police eventually caught up with the fanatic, who was been jailed three times, in Gilsum, New Hampshire.

There armed officers persuaded him to let 25-year-old Loretta Colegrove and their four-month-old son Raymond go.

Slocum, who was last seen before the blaze wearing a black t-shirt featuring a skull and crossbones, has since been charged with first degree arson and is expected to be returned to New York.

The baby and his mother were unharmed.

Slocum went on the run while the house was still burning early on Wednesday morning in a 2003 Mustang sparking the alert across New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

He was found later that evening at a property which is thought to be owned by his uncle and is three hours' drive away.

The house in White Creek was a scene of devastation on Thursday as investigators sifted through the rubble to try and find out what had started the blaze.

Friends and relatives of the Harringtons had left floral tributes and some lit candles at the end of the drive.

Records show Slocum was jailed in 2006 for breaking into a house and stealing cash. He was released but broke his parole conditions twice and was sent back before being released again in December 2009.

Speaking to the Post-Star Washington 
County District Attorney Kevin Kortright said police have labelled the 
fire "suspicious" but have not said what they believed caused it.

'There's still a lot of work to be done,' he added.

'The state (Bureau of) Fire guys say it will take all day today to go over the fire scene.'
