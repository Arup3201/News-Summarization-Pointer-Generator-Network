Max Clifford arranged for two topless models to greet Morecambe and Wise producer Ernest Maxim when he arrived at his office, a court has heard.

Celebrity agent Alan Field said Clifford had arranged the prank as 'a bit of fun', adding that Mr Maxim - who rented central London office space from the publicist in the early 1980s - was used to Clifford's 'strong and robust sense of humour.'

Earlier the court heard a former employee who had a year-long affair with Clifford say she had never seen him behaving inappropriately with women.

Clifford, 70, is standing trial at 
Southwark Crown Court accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against 
seven girls and women - all of which he denies.

Claims: Agent Alan Field said Max Clifford (pictured outside Southwark Crown Court this morning) arranged for two topless models to greet Morecambe and Wise producer Ernest Maxim when he arrived at his office

Mr Field, who represented the late 
comedian Lennie Bennett, described how Clifford arranged for the topless
 women to greet Mr Maxim.

'Max
 found the women to do that... The arrangement was made that we would 
have a bit of fun with Ernest Maxim when he arrived,' he said.

'When
 he arrived, he was very nonchalant and casually walked in over to the 
ladies... In a very English manner, he picked up their hands and kissed 
them and told them what a pleasure it was to meet them,' Mr Field added.

Describing Mr Maxim as 'one of the chaps' and 'very good fun', he added: 'He completely ignored the situation that was in front of him.'

Mr Field said both he and Clifford had a 'strong and robust sense of humour' and would play jokes on each other.

He
 told how he encouraged the publicist to use random words including 
'tiddles' and 'Fatty Arbuckle' when he appeared on Newsnight to discuss 
the supermodel Naomi Campbell.

But he denied that the jokes were 'dares'.

Appearing
 for the defence, Mr Field described how the atmosphere a Clifford's New
 Bond Street HQ was 'quite funny and light', but insisted he had never 
seen the publicist do anything 'inappropriate or untoward'.

The
 agent also said he had never witnessed Clifford behave inappropriately 
towards a female, and when asked to describe his character said: 'I 
would say you wouldn't want for a better friend... He was a kind and 
very generous man.

'I knew 
him to be very charitable which he didn't want to be known for, he did 
it all in his own private way, and a good father,' he added.

Earlier
 a former lover of Clifford told the court she was 'not comfortable' 
about their relationship as the publicist had made it clear he was 
already married and had no intention of leaving his wife.

The
 former personal assistant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said 
that although she was having an affair with Clifford, she always found 
him to be 'kind, caring, very funny' and never saw him acting 
inappropriately with women.

The witness, who used to work at Clifford’s New Bond Street office in central London, said she had been in love with the publicist, but added that the year-long relationship ended when she left the company.

She says she was in her late teens when she started a relationship with Clifford a year after she began working at his office.

The witness said the office atmosphere was 'jokey' and 'light hearted' but she never saw him behave inappropriately towards women.

She added that a host of famous celebrities - including the late TV presenter Paula Yates, The Boomtown Rats and comedian Lennie Bennett - would often drop into the offices.

Mr Field denied he had 'dared' Clifford to use the random words on television in reference to Naomi Campbell, saying he had simply 'encouraged' the publicist

Asked by defence barrister Richard Horwell QC if the relationship had been sexual, the woman replied: 'Yes... My memory is we went to a hotel on occasions.'

'I can only speak from professional experience how he was with me - kind, caring, thoughtful and generous,' she added.

'He
 told me right at the beginning he was married and he would not leave 
his wife. He also asked if I was sure... that I wanted to enter this 
relationship.'

The woman said she went to Clifford’s 
home on occasions and once babysat his daughter shortly after she 
started working with him.

Asked
 by the prosecution if she was embarrassed meeting 
Clifford’s wife when she came to the office, the woman paused for a few moments before replying: 'Clearly I’m not comfortable about 
the fact I had a relationship with Max.'

But
 the woman added that the relationship had been 'very important' to her,
 adding that the couple had gone on holiday together to Paris.

Asked about the nature of their relationship, she replied: 'We would go out for dinner and he would take me out for lunch a couple of times during the week and perhaps go to a film... Just very normal in, I suppose, unusual circumstances.'

The relationship ended when she stopped working at Clifford’s office, the witness said.

'We
 both realised it was perhaps best I leave and work somewhere else... 
It took me quite a long time to get over my feelings for Max Clifford.'

The witness was questioned about the size of Clifford’s penis.

The
 court has heard claims that Clifford has a 'micro-penis' measuring two 
and half inches, while one woman told the court it was 'enormous'.

A doctor had measured Clifford’s penis at five and a quarter inches long when flaccid, the jury has been told.

The woman said: 'I can only say it was normal. It was such a long time ago.'

She told the court she never attended any 'sex parties' with Clifford and she did not have sex with him in his office.

Asked why she never had sex with Clifford in the office, she said: 'It 
was never suggested to me and it wouldn't have been something that I 
wanted to do.'

The woman also rubbished claims Clifford's HQ was his own personal 'sexual 
fiefdom' - insisting she never saw him or anyone else naked or having 
sex there.

The
 witness said she kept in contact with Clifford after she stopped 
working at his office, adding: 'I think the fondness just remained.'

Wearing
 a grey blazer and pink shirt, Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, 
listened to the proceedings from with the dock with the aid of a hearing
 loop.

Jurors earlier heard that married father-of-one Clifford had cheated on his first wife Liz with at least four women.

He had an affair with another one of his secretaries, a French model named as Anne Marie, and a TV dancer named Vicky.

The witness said she knew about some but not all of the affairs.

She also revealed that Clifford called once her using the alias 'Terry Denton' to check she was trustworthy.

'Shortly after I started work for Max Clifford I received a phone call from somebody named Terry Denton,' she said.

'I can't remember exactly how the phone call worked out, but I discovered it was to make sure that I could be relied upon to be discrete... The client information was confidential, and this was a way of Max checking.

'Max told me it was him and that client confidentiality was crucial and it was his way of making sure that I could be relied upon.'

The trial continues.
