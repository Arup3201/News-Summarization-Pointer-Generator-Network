Funghi fears: Vast tracts of the New Forest have been stripped of edible mushrooms and the National Trust is blaming 'greedy' commercial pickers

The centuries-old countryside pleasure of foraging for wild mushrooms in the woods has been jeopardised by ‘greedy’ commercial pickers, the National Trust claimed today.

In the New Forest, the charity’s Countryside Team has discovered vast tracts of its land have been completely stripped of edible mushrooms.

The Trust says commercial picking on a large scale is ruining a family day out and the professional fungi hunters are also damaging the environment.

The demand for mushrooms is at a premium after the wettest summer in 100 years left supplies dwindling so professionals are in line for bonanza profits if they can collect enough to sell to top restaurants, hotels and supermarket chains.

New Forest is home to thousands of species and is regarded as one of the best areas in the UK for fungi, according to experts.

Trust volunteer Roger Newton said: ‘Not only was every single edible mushroom taken or cut, just leaving the stalk, but the ground had been badly trampled.

‘Taking mushrooms like this stops the fruiting body’s ability to release its millions of spores each day and the trampling compresses the ground, damaging the places where they like to grow.

‘There is also the danger that someone gathering mushrooms in this quantity could take poisonous varieties, with dire consequences for those eating them.’

The National Trust is the second largest landowner in the New Forest, with 5,900 acres on five different sites.

Lee Hulin, one of the Trust’s outdoor
rangers, said: ‘Our commons are there for everybody so we are 
increasingly saddened that large scale harvesting limits the chance of 
seeing these lovely mushrooms for regular visitors.

‘This sort of plundering is spoiling enjoyment for everyone.’

The mushrooms shortage across the 
British countryside has meant that professionals are flocking to places 
like the New Forest where they can still expect to find enough fungi to 
make picking commercially worthwhile.

The amount paid varies from year to year but experts say commercial pickers can expect to pocket at least £20 per kilo (2.2lbs).

Licence to pick: The only person allowed to pick mushrooms commercially in New Forest is Brigitte Tee-Hillman

Commercial mushroom picking is banned
at the New Forest. The only person allowed to pick mushrooms there 
commercially is Brigitte Tee-Hillman, 65, who won a landmark ruling 
against the Forestry Commission in 2006.

A Commission spokeswoman said: ‘People picking mushrooms should only take enough for personal consumption.

‘This means no more than 1.5kg (3.3lbs) per visit and no more than half the fruiting bodies of any one species.’

Ms Tee-Hillman said: ‘Unless we get rain, rain, rain, we are not going to have any mushrooms.

‘We need a lot of penetrating rain to rescue the season but I don’t think we’re going to get it.

‘Since I got my licence to pick mushrooms 33 years ago I have never known it so bad.

‘The dry, warm spring, wet summer and dry autumn have meant a lack of mushrooms and we have had three ground frosts which hasn’t helped.

‘Usually at this time of year everything would be growing but there is just one here, one there.

'We had no St George’s mushrooms at all earlier in the year and the strange seasons have continued.

‘Brown Chanterelles, hedgehog mushrooms and horn of plenty are all missing.

‘The places I supply to are not getting any locally grown ones and the imported mushrooms are also coming in at different times of the year.’

Prices in the shops are soaring because even imports have been hit by this year's unusual weather and mushrooms all over the world growing at the ‘wrong’ time of year.

The National Trust says the latest wide scale blitz by professional pickers in the New Forest saw the area around Bramshaw Common cleared of its mushrooms.

John Wright, a field mycologist who 
wrote celebrity chef Hugh Fernley Whittingstall’s River Cottage book on 
mushrooms, said the problem was with quantity.

He said: ‘There has been a lot of variety, but the quantity has been poor. The problem is that all the rain came in blocks and although the summer rain was good, there was a six or seven week period this autumn without any rain.

‘The mycelium, the long strands that grow underground, need the rain but fungi do not need to produce mushrooms to survive.

‘Like an apple tree doesn’t need to produce apples, fungi don’t need to produce mushrooms and this year they haven’t.

‘Last year was excellent so the fungi might also have used up their resources. The commercial pickers will certainly be struggling.’

The shortage of mushrooms across the British countryside have meant that professionals are flocking to places like the New Forest (pictured) where they can still expect to find enough fungi to make picking commercially worthwhile

Ken Roberts, from the Dorset Fungi Group, agreed that it was a poor season, but said interest remained high among amateur enthusiasts.

He said: ‘It has been poor so far but there are signs that it is picking up. However, some varieties have been very thin on the ground.

‘The National Trust is running a survey to log the number of wax cap mushrooms and we haven’t seen many of those about but interest in mycology seems to be growing and for our fungi forays numbers are well up on last year.’
