The world's smallest fly is a gruesome parasite that lives inside the heads of ants, growing in size until the victim is decapitated.

The fly, found in Thailand, is just 0.4mm long - the same size or smaller than a grain of salt.

The adult flies lay eggs inside ants' bodies, then the larvae grow to maturity inside their victims' heads, until they finally fall off.

Small but deadly: The fly is a member of a family of parasitic insects that grow to maturity inside the heads of ants

The discovery has shown that even the tiniest insects can be prey to parasites. The flies can decapitate victims with heads as small as 0.5mm.

At just 0.40 millimeters in length, it is 15 times smaller than a house fly and five times smaller than a fruit fly.

Dr. Brian Brown of the Natural History 
Museum of Los Angeles County, these flies can probably decapitate some 
of the smallest ants in the world, ones with heads as small as 0.5 
millimeters.

'It had always been assumed that smaller
species of ants would be free from attack because it would be 
physically impossible for flies that are 1-3 millimeters in length to 
develop in their relatively tiny heads,' he said.

'However, here we show
that even the smallest host ants in a host-parasitoid system cannot 
escape.'

At just 0.40 millimeters in length, it is 15 times smaller than a house fly (pictured) and five times smaller than a fruit fly

The tiny fly, Euryplatea nanaknihali, is also the first of its genus to be discovered in Asia, and it belongs to a fly family (Phoridae) that is known for "decapitating" ants.

Some species in the Phoridae fly family lay eggs in the bodies of ants, and the resulting larvae feed in the ants' heads, eventually causing decapitation. In fact, some of these phorid flies are being used to try to control fire ants in the southern United Sates.

Although this has not yet been observed, it is highly likely because the fly's only known relative, Euryplatea eidmanni, is known to parasitize ants in Equatorial Guinea.
