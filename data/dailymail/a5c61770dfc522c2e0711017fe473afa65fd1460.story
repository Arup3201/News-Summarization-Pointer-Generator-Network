A 17-year-old girl was excited when she found a pink dress on sale for just £10 on Facebook. 

But her delight quickly turned to disgust when she took a closer look at the picture - and saw the naked male photographer reflected in the mirror next to the dress.

Tilly O'Dell, from Bordesley, West Midlands, said she was so offended she reported the image to the social networking site.

Graphic: Tilly O'Dell was shocked when she spotted the naked photographer reflected in the mirror in this photograph, which was posted on Facebook to advertise the vibrant pink dress

The photograph, which was posted on the social networking site, shows the vibrant pink dress hanging against a closed wardrobe door. 

Next to the dress is a mirror - which captures the reflection of the naked man as he holds up his camera to take the picture.

Miss O'Dell, who has a one year old son, said she suspected the Facebook user who posted the image had intended for the naked man to be seen. 

But when she reported the explicit image to the site, she was told it did not violate any of the site's rules and would not be taken down. 

She said: 'I asked my Facebook friends "Share please to get taken down". It's obvious he put the mirror there so you can see him. It shouldn't be on Facebook because kids go on there as well.

'If you want to put that on there you should have said it was for 18-plus.'

The picture was defended by one Facebook user, calling himself Andy Mmxv, who posted: 'Congratulations to the square who has reported this photo for nudity. Thanks to the majority who found it funny.'

Facebook has since reconsidered, and removed the image. 

The site said it does not comment on individual cases but added that its community operations team work quickly and efficiently to review every report it receives.

Facebook added that, on occasion, it makes a mistake and does not remove a piece of content that violates its standards - but when it is alerted to this, it quickly acts to remove the content.

Due to the significant number of reports received Facebook said the image had now been corrected.
