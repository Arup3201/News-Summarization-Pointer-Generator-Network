Britons who store their data on cloud-based servers in America could have all their files rooted through in secret by the U.S. government, it emerged today.

Campaigners say a renewed 
piece of American legislation will allow federal agencies to spy on foreign 
nationals without warning.

The U.S. government granted itself the 
right to snoop after its secret rubber-stamping of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

This means anyone abroad using the internet storage facilities provided by
American companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple, open themselves up to investigation by the federal authorities - while Americans are protected because of their constitution.

Changes: The U.S. government can spy on a foreigner's data after quietly renewing legislation allowing them to snoop

Cloud computing allows internet users to store their information and data in an network server as opposed to in a physical memory stick or tangible location on their hard drive or on their smartphones.

FISA was first put into place under President George W. Bush in 2008, and it was quietly renewed in December under President Obama.

The legislation allows a large swath of the federal government, including the CIA, the FBI, and the National Security Agency, to look at any information they would like that is saved on cloud servers.

They claim it can help them uncover crime and protect the country from terrorism.

One of the most shocking portions of the legislation is the fact that the officials do not need to use the guise of a threat to national security as a way to justify their snooping.

At risk: All data stored in network clouds, used by companies like Apple, can now be accessed by the U.S. government

Round one: The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was initially signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2008 (pictured) but was renewed by President Obama in December 2012

They are able to look into foreign individuals' data for purely political reasons as well.

A report produced about the topic stresses that it is 'much graver risk to EU data sovereignty than other laws hitherto considered by EU policy-makers'.

Slate quoted Caspar Bowden, who co-wrote the report which is now being examined by the European Union, as saying that the legislation has been so gravely ignored by European government officials.

'It's like putting a mind control drug in the water supply, which only affects non-Americans,' he said.

For now, privacy advocates appear to be the only ones up in arms about the issue.

Google responded to requests made by The Independent, saying: 'It is possible for the US government (and European governments) to access certain types of data via their law enforcement agencies. We think this kind of access to data merits serious discussion and more transparency.'
