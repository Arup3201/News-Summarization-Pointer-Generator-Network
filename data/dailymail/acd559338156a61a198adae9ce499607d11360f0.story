Seventy-five per cent of Britons want reclining seats to be banned on planes - and 27 per cent admit to having a row with another passenger about them.

A new poll reveals that travellers in front tipping their chair back is one of a holidaymaker's biggest pet peeves - coming second only to being separated from sitting with friends and family on a plane.

Flyers' other biggest annoyances were crying children on board a flight (67 per cent); not having enough leg room (48 per cent); and poor customer service from flight attendants (29 per cent).

Air rage: A new poll of British travellers reveals that three quarters want to see reclining seat banned

1. Being seated separately to those I'm travelling with - 73%

2. When people in front of me recline their seats into my personal space - 66%

3. Crying children - 64%

4. Not enough leg room - 48%

5. Poor customer service from the flight attendants - 29%

More than 73 per cent cited being split from people they were travelling with as their main concern, followed by 66 per cent who said they hated people in front of them reclining their plane seat, according to the survey by www.jetcost.co.uk.

Some 2,411 Britons, all of whom had flown at least once in the past 12 months, were asked 'What are you biggest pet peeves when flying?'.

All respondents who selected reclining seats as one of their pet peeves were asked 'Do you ever recline your own seat when you're flying?' with almost two thirds of the relevant respondents (64 per cent) admitting that they did.

Those who said ‘yes’ were asked why they did this if it annoyed them so much when other people did.

Nearly 40 per cent said it was to get more comfortable, while 32 per cent said it was to help them to get to sleep.

However, when asked why they didn't like it when other passengers reclined their seats, the main response was that passengers felt it was rude behaviour 'to invade my limited leg space' (41 per cent).

Room to move:  64% of passengers admit they are guilty of reclining their seat on board a plane

Thirty-nine per cent said the person in front reclining their seat prevented them from using their tray.

Furthermore, 27 per cent of the total respondents admitted to having previously got in to some form of confrontation with a fellow passenger over either their own or another passenger’s reclining seat.

Seventy-five per cent of respondents felt that reclining seats during flights should be banned.

Furthermore, 12 per cent planned to invest in knee defenders before their next flight.

Antoine Michelat, co-founder of Jetcost.co.uk, said: 'The issue of reclining seats has received a great deal of attention recently and it's got people wanting to purchase knee defenders to prevent others invading the limited leg space they already have during a flight.

Room to move: 27% of passengers say they have got into a row with a passenger over reclining seats

'But this carries with it the risk of being kicked off a flight if they choose to use them. 

'A simple solution for this would be for passengers to stipulate when booking if they want a seat that reclines or not - if they do they're seated with others who also wish to recline their seats, if they don't then they'll be seated with others who don't wish to recline their seats.

'I think that banning the ability to recline your seat during a flight might be a tad drastic, but if people are going to continue being kicked off their flights over this, it may be the best solution in the long run.'

Controversial: Two flights have been diverted in recent months because of passengers coming to blows over the use of the controversial Knee Defender gadget

Pet peeves: Not being seated with travelling companions, poor customer service and crying children feature

The $21.95 Knee Defender from Gadgetduck.com has been making headlines worldwide after two flights were forced to divert due to passengers fighting over its use on flights.

The plastic gadget hooks on to the tray table to prevent the seat in front being reclined.

It is currently being left up to airlines to enforce their policy on the use of the gadget, with Qantas and Virgin Australia banning them.

Responding to another recent survey of airline passengers, Monarch Airlines announced earlier this year that they would be rolling out non-reclining seats across its fleet this year.
