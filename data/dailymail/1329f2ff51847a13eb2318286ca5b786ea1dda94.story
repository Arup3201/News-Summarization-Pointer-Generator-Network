Twenty 'protesters' who were detained in the build-up to the Royal wedding are to challenge the legality of the tactics used by police.

They say Met Police at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge operated an unlawful policy of pre-emptively stopping, searching and arresting those they believed were likely to express 'anti-monarchist' views.

Judges at London's High Court have given the go-ahead for a full judicial review hearing, which is expected to take place in the new year.

Unrest: Police, seen her controlling crowds outside Buckingham Palace, have been accused of unlawfully stopping and searching 20 people

Lord Justice Elias, sitting with Mr Justice King, said: 'We have reached the conclusion that there is a sufficient basis for concluding that permission should be granted.'

Police lawyers have responded to the claims by saying there is no evidence of an unlawful policy, and policing activities on the wedding day were aimed at preventing criminal conduct, not preventing lawful protest.

The Met has pointed out that several anti-royal protests took place in central London which were peaceful and the police did not intervene.

Security around high profile royal wedding locations such as the Mall in central London was tight and extensive on April 29 this year

All 20 individuals were arrested in London on April 29, the day Prince William married Kate Middleton, or were subjected to searches on days leading up to the wedding.

Two of the applicants, Theodora Middleton and Dafydd Lewis, had their possessions searched when police officers raided their homes at Sipson Camp, a squatters' site in West Drayton, Uxbridge, west London.

The camp was initially set up to oppose the building of a new runway at Heathrow Airport but later turned into a community garden and climate change campaign centre.

Lawyers for Ms Middleton and Mr Lewis argue that the searches constituted an 'unlawful interference' with their right to respect for their homes and private life under human rights legislation.

They are also challenging the legality of a decision by Bromley magistrates to grant the police a search warrant.

Hannah Pearce and Shirin Golsirat are seeking judicial review of 'unlawful' searches and seizures of property when other squats were raided across London.

Their lawyers argue that the police acted 'outside the scope' of their search warrants.

Brian Hicks and 14 other applicants 
are challenging a series of 'pre-emptive arrests' made by Met officers 
at various locations in central London on the wedding day.

They
include individuals in fancy dress who attended a 'zombie picnic', or 
alternative royal wedding, organised at Soho Square by Queer Resistance.

Lawyers
for Mr Hicks say the arrests were unjustified as the police had no 
reasonable grounds for suspecting a breach of the peace.

The youngest claimant is 16-year-old M, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

Special occasion: Police have pointed out that several anti-monarchist protests took place during William and Kate's wedding, which were peaceful and required no further action

All 20 of the complainants were arrested on April 29, the day of William and Kate's wedding, or subjected to searches in the days leading up to the wedding

He was seen to be carrying a megaphone and stopped and searched on his way to Soho Square. He was handcuffed and arrested on suspicion of possessing items - felt-tip pens - with intent to commit criminal damage.

His lawyers argue that his stop and search and subsequent arrest were unlawful and for the ulterior purpose of 'suppressing lawful anti-monarchist protest on the day of the wedding'.

The judges indicated that the case should go ahead as a formal judicial review application, unless parties made requests to cross-examine witnesses, in which case an alternative court process might have to be followed.
