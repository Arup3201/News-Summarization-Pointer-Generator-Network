NBC News medical correspondent Dr Nancy Snyderman will be back on the network on Wednesday after being shelved for more than a month following a violation of her quarantine for possible Ebola exposure.

A network executive said on Tuesday that Snyderman, 62, will report on a medical issue for the Today show and NBC's Nightly News. The story won't be about Ebola.

There was some question about whether the veteran medical journalist would ever return to NBC News.  

Dr Nancy Snyderman, pictured on NBC's Today show in 2011, will return to screens on Wednesday to report on a medical story - but not about Ebola

She had been reporting on the Ebola outbreak in Liberia for NBC in October at the time a cameraman who briefly worked with her, Ashoka Mukpo, came down with the deadly virus. 

Mukpo was transferred back to the U.S. for treatment at a Nebraska medical facility and has since recovered. 

Snyderman and the rest of the NBC team were urged to quarantine themselves for a 21-day period upon their return to the United States. 

Neither she nor anyone else from the network came down with Ebola.

During the midst of that quarantine, Snyderman and her crew were spotted getting takeout food from a New Jersey restaurant, prompting New Jersey officials to make her quarantine mandatory.

Her takeout foray angered her bosses and unleashed a bitter response online, with some suggestions by viewers that they would have a hard time trusting her again after the mistake in judgment. NBC News President Deborah Turness told Dr Snyderman to take some time off. 

A statement from NBC said: 'While in Liberia Dr Nancy and her team delivered first class, first-hand reporting from the front lines of this tragic and monumental story. 

'Their subsequent departure from Monrovia, their return to the U.S. and period of quarantine has been a challenging time.

'We have encouraged them – and they have agreed – to take some time off with their families and friends to help restore some normalcy to their lives. We very much look forward to their return next month.' 

There's no word on whether Snyderman will address the issue with viewers when she returns to the air.

Snyderman, a surgeon, has been at NBC News since 2006 after spending 17 years as a medical correspondent for ABC News.
