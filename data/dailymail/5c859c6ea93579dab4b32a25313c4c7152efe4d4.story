The dollar has reached a four-year high just hours before a report showed another jobs boost.

Shares also closed at record levels last night - the second in a row - ahead of a report saying the U.S. gained 214,000 jobs in October and unemployment fell from 7.2 to 5.8 per cent in a year.

The findings were in today's Employment Situation report, a snapshot of the economy released every month by the Department of Labor.

U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez claimed the figures meant 10.6million jobs have been created in 56 months.

However, he added: 'There is still widespread economic inequality. Wages haven't kept pace with productivity. We are in the middle of the strongest run of private-sector job growth in 16 years, but we need the same broadly-shared prosperity that we had in the late 1990s.

'Today's rising tide is only lifting some boats, while too many others are struggling to stay above water. We have to do more.'

Although many would have been part-time positions, the average number of weekly hours per employee held steady from 34.4 in October 2013 to 34.6 in October 2014, the report said.

An average week's earnings rose slightly in the same period from $828 to $850.

Investors said the jobs figure, although far from a record, would be another solid showing after gains of 248,000 jobs in September, 180,000 in August and 243,000 in July.

The news prompted the dollar to hit a four-year high this morning, reaching 88.174 on the FOREX index.

The rise of 0.1 per cent in a day brought it to its strongest level since June 2010 and marked a 12 per cent boost in just six months.

And two of America's biggest share indexes closed at record highs last night as investors put their faith in the claims.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 69.94 points (0.40 per cent) to 17,554.47, while the broad-based S&P 500 gained 7.64 (0.38 per cent) at 2,031.21.

The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also added 17.75 points (0.38 percent) to reach 4,638.47.

The boost is a piece of long-awaited good news for President Obama - though his Republican rivals are likely to take some of the credit.

Stocks had also hit record levels on Wednesday as investors credited the Republicans taking control of the Senate - and hopes they would be more business-friendly.

One analyst told USA Today the markets have historically thrived with a Republican Senate and a Democratic President.

Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, added the mood among investors was 'fairly positive'.

He also credited comments by the president of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi, who said he was preparing more stimulus measures to head off the crisis in the Eurozone.

One of the biggest stock market winners was organic groceries chain Whole Foods Market, whose shares shot up 12.2 per cent after revealing a boost in quarterly profits to $128million.

Electric luxury car maker Tesla Motors also gained 4.4 per cent as quarterly car sales hit $851.8million, almost double what they were a year ago.

Losers included chip developer Qualcomm, which tumbled 8.6 per cent as it disclosed the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating its licensing business.

And real-estate website Zillow fell 4.2 per cent as quarterly losses hit $16million.
