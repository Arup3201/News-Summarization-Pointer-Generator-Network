England were defeated 5-2 by Sri Lanka in the seven-match one-day series and, in truth, very few players have done their World Cup chances much good.

Joe Root was the star for the tourists but that was not much of a contest, so bad were many of his team-mates.

With the squad for the World Cup being announced on Saturday, Sportsmail assess the England players who appeared in Sri Lanka (highest rated top).

Joe Root, on his way to 80 in Colombo, was England's best player during their tour of Sri Lanka

8 Joe Root (Games 7; batting average 73.40; 1 wicket at 110)

England’s best Test batsman in the summer, and their best one-day batsman here. Match-winning century in Pallekele was a masterpiece of timing and good sense.

7 James Taylor (Games 4; average 42.50)

Shone twice, using his feet superbly to the spinners, and running like a hare. But it took England until the fourth game to pick him, and he faded.

7 Moeen Ali (Games 7; average 33.71; 5 wickets at 63.80)

No one struck the ball more sweetly. There were failures, especially against Tillakeratne Dilshan’s off-breaks, but his 12 sixes were nine more than anyone else, and his strike-rate was 123. Useful off-spin too.

James Taylor shone in two matches, while Moeen Ali hit more sixes than any other England batsman

7 James Tredwell (Games 5; average 17.00; 4 wickets at 54.75)

England’s tightest bowler was unlucky to miss out on a turning Colombo pitch for the fourth match. But pitches at the World Cup won’t suit him.

6 Ravi Bopara (Games 6; average 30.83; 1 wicket at 82.00)

Began with two fifties and was promoted to No 5, as he wanted. But he reverted to his frustrating ways. Should have bowled more than 15 overs.

6 Chris Jordan (Games 5; average 1.66; 10 wickets at 26.00)

His accuracy and rhythm showed odd signs of improvement, and Cook wants him at the World Cup. His slip-catching and potential with the bat could count in his favour.

6 Chris Woakes (Games 7; average 20.60; 14 wickets at 25.28)

Confirmed his extra bite with the ball, and collected six-for in the win at Pallekele. Expensive at times, but may have overtaken Finn.

5 Ian Bell (Games 2; average 23.00)

Dropped for Hales after two games. May have to concentrate on Tests from now on.

5 Jos Buttler (Games 7; average 29.00)

Finished off the run-chase in Hambantota, but his keeping grew scruffier as the tour progressed. England need to manage him carefully.

5 Steven Finn (Games 5; average 2.00; 5 wickets at 43.80)

Heartening to see him take the new ball after his woes last winter, but didn't offer England enough early breakthroughs.

3 Alastair Cook (Games 6; average 19.83)

Barely a day went by when the question of his captaincy didn’t overshadow everything else. His strike-rate was a relic-like 67.

3 Alex Hales (Games 3; average 11.33)

Given only three chances, but took none of them. A frustrated figure for much of the tour.

3 Harry Gurney (Games 3; average 8.00; 1 wicket at 158.00)

One wicket for 158 in three games, and shaky in the field. Will be lucky to make World Cup squad.

3 Eoin Morgan (Games 7; average 12.85)

Produced only one innings of substance – when he was standing in as captain for the banned Cook in the fourth game. Averaged less than five otherwise. Missing his usual spark.

2 Ben Stokes (Games 3; average 11.00; 0 wickets)

Utterly devoid of confidence, with both bat and ball. The Ashes seem a long time ago.

Ben Stokes' confidence with both bat and ball has gone through the floor
