Detectives investigating the death of a newborn girl fear she may have been alive when she was stuffed into a Tesco carrier bag and dumped in a ditch, it emerged today.

Officers believe the child they have named 'Alia' was not stillborn as at first thought and lived for around two hours.

The girl’s body was discovered by dog walkers at the remote Ox Hey Lane in Lostock near Bolton, Greater Manchester, on Mother’s Day last month.

Macabre: Detectives investigating the baby's death fear she may have been alive when she was stuffed into a Tesco carrier bag and dumped in a ditch and not dead as previously thought

The body was wrapped in clothing and plastic bags and a message was found requesting she receive an Islamic burial.

Police chose to name the girl her Alia, which means beautiful, following discussions with the Bolton Council of Mosques.

Today, Greater Manchester Police confirmed they were now working to establish whether Alia was still alive when she was dumped.

Officers
have also released pictures of items found with Alia’s body including 
the Tesco carrier bag upon which was written in English were the words 
'Please please bury him Islamic way please please' - despite the body 
being a girl’s.

Police said 
it was an old Tesco carrier bag and one that is not currently in 
circulation. It is believed Alia was wrapped in a white shirt, cotton 
trousers and placed in this bag.

Evidence: Detectives have released images of the JD Sports bag (left) the Tesco bag was placed in and a pair of three-quarter length, paint-stained trousers (right) in which Alia was wrapped

Religious element: The body was wrapped in clothing and plastic bags and a message was found requesting she receive an Islamic burial

Det Insp Aaron Duggan said: 'Despite the passage of time our primary concern still remains the welfare of baby Alia’s parents, in particular her mother.

'She was found almost six weeks ago and we still need to make sure both mum and dad are OK both physically and mentally. This will have been a traumatic experience for them particularly if they are young.

'We have made good progress with the investigation and now know that she was born alive and lived independently from her mother for a short period. What we don’t know, and what we are trying to establish, is how, where and when she died and when she was placed at Ox Hey Lane and by whom.

'That is why we need to find her parents and it is for this reason I have released images of some of the items recovered with Alia’s body.'

Officers also released images of the JD Sports bag in which the Tesco bag was placed. The JD sports bag was used during sales twice yearly - once in the summer and again at Christmas.

Appeal: Greater Manchester Police confirmed they were now working to establish whether Alia was still alive when she was dumped

It is not currently in circulation. A picture was also released of a pair of three quarter length, paint stained, cotton trousers Alia was wrapped in.

DI Duggan added: 'I want the public to look at them closely. Does anyone recognise the trousers or the hand writing on the bag?

'I want people to think about someone that perhaps they knew or suspected was, up until recently, pregnant and, coupled with these images, now think they know who the mother or father is and to call us in confidence.

'I want to appeal to the parents directly to come forward, to talk to us and explain what happened to their daughter. I want to reassure them that specialist help is still available if required. I also want to appeal to family members or close friends who may be able to help.

'I will continue to search for the answers needed in order for us to fulfil the wishes of whoever left the note with Alia on Ox Hey Lane and release her body for an Islamic burial. I would like to be able to do this having first spoken to her parents.'

 Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 5448, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
