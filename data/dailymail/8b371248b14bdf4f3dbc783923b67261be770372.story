Drifting together in an affectionate embrace, these turtles look as though they were interrupted while sharing an intimate moment.

Photographer Montse Grillo, 37, captured the shots of the green turtles while diving off the coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands.

The animals swam up to the divers as they were curious about their reflections in the camera lens.

The pair of green turtles shared an intimate embrace off the coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands, 100 km  west of the southern border of Morocco

Far from being camera shy, the sea creatures swam up close to a pair of divers and  posed for several minutes with them

Ms Grillo, who is self-employed, said: 'Turtles and I are great friends and I love to spend time with them so I thought I would take a selfie.

'The photos are the result of dedication, patience, perseverance and a passion for turtles.

'Turtles know me and are very loving. They are curious because of the reflections in my lens.'

Green turtles, which are common in Tenerife, can  live up to eighty years in the wild. They grow up to 1.5m and can weigh up to 190 kg.

The photographer who lives just 15 minutes away, dived with her friend, Sara Garcia. 

The turtles  were so friendly they approached photographer Montse Grillo, 37, so she could take a 'selfie' in her diving gear

Green turtles are listed as an endangered species, but a sub-population in the Mediterranean is listed as critically endangered.

Despite  this, they are still killed for their meat and eggs.

The sea turtles  undertake lengthy migrations from feeding sites to nesting grounds, normally on sandy beaches. 

Mating occurs every two to four years and normally takes place in shallow waters close to the shore. 

To nest, females leave the sea and choose an area, often on the same beach used by their mothers, to lay their eggs.

Unlike most sea turtles, adult green turtles are herbivorous, feeding on sea grasses and algae. Juveniles will also eat invertebrates like crabs, jellyfish, and sponges.

Males are slightly larger than females and have a longer tail. Both have flippers that resemble paddles, which make them powerful and graceful swimmers.

Ms Grillo said: 'Turtles and I are great friends and I love to spend time with them. They are curious because of the reflections in my lens'

Green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Some swim more than 2,600 km to reach their spawning grounds
