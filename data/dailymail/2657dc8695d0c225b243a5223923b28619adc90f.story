Her commitment to her son's career is legendary.

She gave him his first 
tennis racket when he was just two and coached him until he was 11. She even sacrificed her marriage to follow him around the world.

And as she returns to the All England
Club to watch every one of Andy Murray's matches, it appears that the world number two's mother has better things to do than worry about dying her hair.

New do: Andy Murray's mother Judy sported a grey hair do today as she arrived at day one of Wimbledon Tennis Championships 2013 to support her son

53-year-old Judy Murray showcased a new grey hair do at Wimbledon today, prompting many to question whether eight years of supporting her son courtside is starting to take its toll.

Speaking ahead of his match today, Judy said: 'He's 
been playing in Wimbledon since 2005, I think he missed just one year 
through injury, and you have your own way of dealing with it.

'I've done it many times but it doesn't get any less stressful.'

The former British tennis coach usually sports a bobbed brunette or sandy blonde hairstyle, but it seems she has hung up her the hair dye and opted to age more naturally.

Judy famously loves mothering Andy, once even rushing out to buy thermometers to check his bathwater was exactly 37 degrees, as prescribed by his physio.

Once, when he didn't have the right shoes for a big match in Miami, she flew out from Britain with a new pair. 'What else could I do?' she said.

Sadly, her commitment took its toll on her relationship with husband Willie - the pair split when Andy was just nine.

At the time, she said: 'I was away a lot and then you're coaching until quite late in the evening. Your domestic life gets hit for six.'

In June 2005, during Andy's Wimbledon debut, she was nicknamed 'Spy Mum' after using a video camera to film Andy's opponent George Bastl for him to analyse.

As well as supporting Andy from the 
stands as he bids to become the first British champion since Fred Perry 
in 1936, Judy will be spending time with her son at his home in Surrey 
during the tournament.

She said: 'The grass court season is the time when he can actually stay at home.

'He lives about half an hour away from Wimbledon - so he has that luxury of being able to stay at home.

'It is nice to be able to spend a bit of family time and be hi his own surroundings with his girlfriend and his dogs.'

If Murray gets through the early stages 
of the tournament, the 26-year-old could come up 
against top seeds Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, two-time winner Rafael Nadal or 
defending champion Roger Federer.

However, Judy would not be drawn on her son's chances at Wimbledon.

She said: 'You never look further than the first round.

'There's always an advantage when you've
played somebody recently, in terms of working out your game plan and 
tactics, particularly when it's on the same surface.'

Redhead: Judy, who watches her sons every match and says it doesn't get any easier, has also sported red hues in the past (pictured here in 2010 and 2009 with Andy's girlfriend Kim Sears)

The people of Andy's home town are 
fiercely proud of their local hero - packing Dunblane's pubs, hotels and
tennis club to cheer him on.

Judy, from Bridge of Allan near Stirling, says her son draws strength from this backing.

She said: 'He always has incredible support from the local communities. They really push the boat out at this time of year.'

Judy attended the Royal Highland Show in
Edinburgh this weekend to showcase her Set4Sport initiative, which aims
to get children active.

The programme centres on homemade games she played with her sons when they were growing up.

She explained: 'They're all games we made up when Jamie and Andy were small.

Support system: Judy is her son's number one fan and has supported him since day one. Here, she is pictured at his first ever Wimbledon tennis championships in June 2005

'I had two boisterous young boys at home
and not much money, so we were always challenging ourselves to find 
things that we could do when the weather's bad, often it was things we 
could do inside, without spending a lot of money.

'Biscuit tin lid cereal boxes, for example. We played that with cereal boxes for the net, biscuit lids for bats and a ping pong ball.

'It's all simple stuff and you don't need to go out and spend any money or book a pitch to do it.'

It was these activities that contributed to Andy and Jamie's success on the court, according to Judy.

'I believe that doing so many fun activities when the kids were small helped to develop good hand-eye coordination.

'Andy, as well as being a really good tennis player, was also an extremely good football player.

Doting: Judy famously loves mothering Andy and even used to rush out to buy thermometers to check his bathwater was exactly 37 degrees, as prescribed by his physio

'Up to age 14 he was as much football as
tennis and he opportunity to do something with Rangers when he was 14 -
that's when he made the decision to go into tennis.

'And Jamie was a pre-handicapper at golf when he was 16.'

Despite his talents, Andy Murray says he has come to terms with the fact that he may not win Wimbledon - and claims he is now a better player because of it.

The Scottish tennis ace said yesterday that his failure to win the championship last year had taught him not to put too much pressure on himself.

Speaking on the eve of this year’s games at SW19, the world number two warned fans he could not guarantee a win - and that he was ‘comfortable’ with that.

The little things: Judy credits her son's success to the games she used to play with him when he was younger, which she maintains improved his hand-eye coordination

He added that his new attitude would allow him to just ‘go out there and play’ - without worrying about letting anyone down.

Last year, when he lost to Roger Federer, his devastation was plain to see on live television when he shed several tears on court.

Among the crestfallen crowd on the day were his girlfriend, Kim Sears, and the Duchess of Cambridge - both of whom were also crying.

After that disappointment, he went on to beat Federer and win gold at the London Olympics - and also became the champion of the US Open.

Jonathan Long, nice’n easy Colour Advisor says: 'Once you start seeing the signs of grey, you might want to embrace your silver tones.

'The key is to keep your hair in great condition by having regular deep conditioning treatments and ensuring your ends are trimmed so hair stays vibrant and glossy. Grey doesn't mean dull.

'Grey hairs are actually colourless hairs within your own hair that soften the overall effect of your colour.

'When covering them, I would always go for a shade or two lighter than your normal hair colour as this will even out the difference between the naturally faded hair and the "greys", giving you back the all over intensity and depth of tone that you are used to!'
