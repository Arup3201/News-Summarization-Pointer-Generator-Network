A foal suffered some of the most horrific wounds ever seen by vets after its owner left a tight head collar on for months.

Star was just two months old when he was found by animal welfare officers with the head collar sunk into his head on farmland in Herefordshire.

The collar had been  left on for so long it had become embedded into the foal's nose, jaw and flesh behind his ears leaving the foal with  scarring and damage to his facial bones.

Star's owner, Pascale Musk, has now been banned from keeping horses for three years after she was found guilty of breaching the Animal Welfare Act 2006 at St Albans Magistrates' Court in August this year.

The World Horse Welfare field officer, Nick White, who was first called to Star's aid alongside the RSPCA called the pony's suffering the 'worst kind of neglect.'

'No animal should have to suffer in this way,' he added. 'Star had to undergo intensive care from vets and the staff at World Horse Welfare - all this is funded by our supporters and without them, we couldn't manage, so it's thanks to them that we're able to do this work.'

Star had to undergo the surgical removal of the head collar and extensive rehabilitation at World Horse Welfare rescue centre in Bristol

His owner Pascale Musk, who admitted breaching the Animal Welfare Act 2006 by leaving the tight collar on, has now been banned from keeping horses for three years

'Star faced what was, to my mind, absolute unnecessary suffering and the worst kind of neglect.'

After surgical removal of Star's head collar and extensive rehabilitation at World Horse Welfare rescue centre in Bristol, the young foal has happily now found a new home - just in time for Christmas.

Charlotte Shepherd, 22, had followed the foal's story in the media and decided to offer Star a fresh start.

She said: 'I just couldn't believe anyone could do this to any animal, let alone a foal.

'I thought to myself, I can actually give this pony a home - I've got the means, the space and the land.

'The story made my heart bleed so much - I just couldn't help offering him a home.

'It's so lovely because if I go to the field to catch him, he comes to call. Considering what he went through, it's amazing that he still has trust in humans.

'He didn't deserve to go through such pain. It makes me mad that someone could have allowed Star to go through so much trauma when he was so vulnerable.

'He's in his new little rug now and he thinks he's the business. He's so happy.

'Now that he's in his new home and we've spent time together he's not fazed by anything and happily eats at the hay with my three other horses.

'He's my little superstar.'
