But even the news that she has amassed a £64million fortune has not been enough to put a smile on the face of internet sensation Grumpy Cat – real name Tardar Sauce.

The feline, who shot to fame two years ago in a YouTube video that got 15.7 million views, has earned more than Hollywood stars Nicole Kidman, Cameron Diaz and Matthew McConaughey.

Owner Tabatha Bundesen from Morristown, Arizona, said the two-year-old moggy is 'unstoppable'.
