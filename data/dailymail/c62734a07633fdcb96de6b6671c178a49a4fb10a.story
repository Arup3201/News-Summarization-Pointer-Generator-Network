Jordan Henderson feels Liverpool are more than a match for any team in the Barclays Premier League after they continued their excellent recent run with a 3-2 win over Tottenham.

The Reds are now firmly in the hunt for a top-four place after extending their unbeaten streak in the league to nine matches.

They now lie just three points behind fourth-placed Arsenal and Henderson believes they are capable of beating anyone put in front of them.

'We always feel we can beat anyone if we keep playing the way we have been,' he said on BT Sport 1.

'We've got some fantastic players here so we've just got to keep working hard on the training field and getting results like that.

'We've got a little momentum, we've been playing some great stuff and I thought we showed great character tonight.'

It looked set to be a frustrating night for the Merseysiders as Spurs twice fought back from a goal down.

Lazar Markovic's opener was cancelled out by the in-form Harry Kane, while Spurs levelled again, after Steven Gerrard had put Liverpool back in front from the penalty spot, through Mousa Dembele.

But forgotten man Mario Balotelli swooped to stab home seven minutes from time for his first league goal since his £16million move from AC Milan last summer.

It was a muted celebration from the Italian, although Henderson thinks his team-mate will be delighted with his contribution.

'I'm sure he'll be smiling in the dressing room. When he came on, he worked hard and got the goal and the three points for the team,' he added.

'When he came on, he worked hard and got the goal and the three points for the team. Hopefully we can kick on now.

'We've got momentum, we've been playing some great stuff. We showed great character tonight, stuck at it and got three points at the end.'

Speaking in the absence of manager Brendan Rodgers, who had to catch a flight, assistant boss Colin Pascoe paid tribute to the Italian, who has struggled to settle back in English football since joining Liverpool for £16million last summer.

'He is immensely happy,' said Pascoe. 'To get a winner at Anfield, I am sure he is happy.

'It was great movement from Mario in the six-yard box. I hope it can be a springboard, he is training hard. The last couple of weeks he's been ill and had gashes on his feet so couldn't get his boots on.

'It was important for us tonight to win the game, Tottenham have been on a great run. It was two good teams but the way we came through was fantastic.

'We knew it would be a tough game. It was very important we got the three points to close the gap. Our next game is Southampton and we will look at that to get three points and close the gap.

'It was that kind of game, a great spectacle. We knew we would always create chances. Daniel Sturridge is always a threat in behind. It was great for young Jordon Ibe, he played very well. He slipped that ball into Adam Lallana, who played it in to Mario to get a winner.'

One concern for Liverpool was that captain Steven Gerrard went off with a hamstring problem. Pascoe added: 'It is a precaution. He looked over and said he could feel it a little.'

Tottenham's in-form striker Harry Kane scored his 23rd goal of the season to remain the top marksman in the Premier League. It was the first League goal Liverpool had conceded for 416 minutes.

Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino claimed a draw would have been a fair result.

The Argentine said: 'We are disappointed with the result because I think one point would have been fair for both teams. It was a great game, we played well but this is football. The players are very disappointed, sad and tired but we have to accept football is like this.

'I am proud of the effort and we have to look forward. The only thing we need to improve — in the first half we gave Liverpool some chances and made some mistakes. We deserved more from this game.'
