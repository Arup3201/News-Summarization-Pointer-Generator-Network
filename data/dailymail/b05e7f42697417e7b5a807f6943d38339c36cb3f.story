Four fully armed RAF Typhoon jets are to patrol the skies over the Baltic in a dramatic show of strength intended to warn Russian President Vladimir Putin against mounting an invasion.

The sorties will begin next month, with UK pilots under orders to respond forcefully to any violations of the airspace of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

The four Typhoons will be based at Siauliai in Lithuania where they will join a detachment of four Polish MiG-29s.

Four RAF Typhoon jets are set to start patrolling the skies over the Baltic next month in a NATO show of strength intended to warn Russian President Vladimir Putin against mounting an invasion of Ukraine

The four Typhoons will be based in Siauliai, Lithuania. Nato is trippling its numbers of aircraft protecting the Baltic in a bid to stave off any aggression from Russia. It comes as pro-Russian militants took hold of police stations in several eastern Ukrainian cities on Saturday

Overall, Nato is tripling its numbers of aircraft protecting the Baltic in a bid to stave off any aggressive moves by Russia. The Danish Air Force is providing four F-16 aircraft.

Nato usually has only four aircraft in its Baltic air policing operation, but this will reach 12 by next month – an attempt to reassure the region after Russia’s occupation of Crimea.

Some 40,000 Russian troops remain within striking distance of eastern Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Nato is drawing  up plans to deploy thousands of ground troops to the Baltic.

This international force may include UK personnel, although the Ministry of Defence has yet to receive a request to supply soldiers.

Last night Nato communications chief Lieutenant-Colonel Jay  Janzen told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We stand in support of our Baltic allies and are ready to help them deal with any threats.

‘We want to reassure our allies without escalating this crisis any further than it needs to be. So we will not be sending any aircraft or troops outside Alliance territory.

‘Nato insists Russia pulls back its troops from the [Ukrainian] border but there hasn’t been a response.

'Now Nato wants to develop a range of land, air and sea-based measures. Forces could come from any of our 28 states. There will be a decision in the next week or two.

‘The Russian troops are still  sitting along the border with Ukraine and our eastern allies, the Baltic states, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, are expressing real concern.

'We must send a message to Russia that this type of activity is not acceptable.’
