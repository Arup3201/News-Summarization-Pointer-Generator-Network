For many of us, it is the sort of challenge that you might attempt once in your life – a brief throwing of caution to the winds; a bucket-list box ticked, perhaps never to be repeated.

But for one undoubtedly brave – and perhaps reckless – British adventurer, bungee jumping comes so easily that he decided to do it 151 times.

In a single day.

A man with a crazy plan: Colin Phillips has time to smile for the camera as he forges out on his world record bid

And then he was gone: Phillips heads towards terra firma as he ticks off another leap from above

Colin Phillips performed his repeated game of chicken with gravity in Dubai, as part of an attempt to break the world record for the number of jumps in a 24-hour period.

And he achieved his aim, smashing the previous high-water mark of 105, which was set by South African daredevil Kevin Huntly - at the Bloukrans Bungy Bridge, on South Africa’s famous Garden Route - in May 2011.

Mr Phillips is based in Dubai, and pulled off his feat by leaping from a 100-metre crane at a bungee facility, Gravity Zone.

This is attached to the Dubai Autodrome, a race-track where adrenaline junkies can drive fast cars amid the dust and sand of the desert emirate.

Prepare for lift-off: Phillips was attempting to break the previous high mark for the number of bungee jumps in one day, 105, set in South Africa three years ago

All downhill from here: Phillips ticked off a remarkable 151 bungee jumps over three different sessions during his 24-hour challenge

The 33-year-old split his earthbound tumbles into three sessions.

He began on the evening of (Thursday) 20 March, jumping from 7pm until 11pm.

Then, after resting for seven hours, he recommenced at 6am on the Friday morning, continuing until 10.30am.

By 10.20am, he had beaten the record, pushing it up by one to 106 – but was not content to leave it at this figure. A further session of rest over lunchtime saw him remount the jumping platform for a final burst of rapid descents, between 3pm and the cut-off point at 7pm.

Record broken, let's do some more: Phillips set a new high mark with plenty of time to spare - before adding 46 to the prior top total

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the process left Mr Phillips feeling exhausted.

‘I feel a bit beaten up, to be honest,’ he told The National.

‘Every jump has been different. Sometimes it’s a good one, sometimes it’s not so good.’

Due to the stresses placed on his body by so many leaps in quick succession, Mr Phillips was forced regularly to change the position of his safety harness, transferring it between his ankles and his chest.

The ankles tend to be the standard point of attachment in bungee-jump procedure, but staff on hand deemed it necessary to make the switch.

All smiles, no injuries: Apart from a dislocated finger and a sore body, Phillips achieved his target without any medical concerns

‘It’s mostly to stop my ankles from 
being completely ripped to shreds,’ Mr Phillips explained.

‘Neither [of 
the harness positions] are easier, you’re still getting the same force 
and sustained pressures on the body.’

He did suffer one small injury – dislocating his finger after catching it in his harness, requiring the assistance of a sports therapist, who quickly clicked the errant digit back into place.

But he was not affected by migraines or dizziness – two unpleasant consequences that could have resulted from so many head-long rushes towards terra firma.

Circles in the sand: Phillips attempted his record at the Dubai Autodrome, a popular race track in the desert emirate

Mr Phillips achieved his target with a considerable amount of time to spare.

In total, he jumped for less than 12 hours, settling for a final total of 151.

He had hoped to break the 200-jump barrier, but found that tiredness hindered his efforts.

That figure was verified by an official from Guinness World Records – which now has an office in Dubai, due to the number of world-record bids that are now attempted in a place where biggest, fastest, highest and most have become cherished mantras.

Big boys' toy: Dubai is no stranger to great heights and world records, thanks to the towering presence of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper, the tallest building on the planet

‘The office was opened here because demand was so high for record-breaking events,’ said Samer Khallouf, the Guinness adjudicator who monitored the attempt.

The Burj Khalifa, which opened in Dubai in 2010, is, of course, the tallest building in the world, reaching into the heavens at a height of 830 metres (2722ft).
