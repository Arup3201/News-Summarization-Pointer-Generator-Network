Friends have defended the millionaire whose girlfriend was found hanging naked and bound from a balcony of his historic California mansion, as he continues to remain silent over her death.

Pharmaceutical tycoon Jonah Shacknai has made no public statement about his girlfriend, Rebecca Nalepa, who died two days after his six-year-old son, Max, was fatally injured when he fell down the stairs.

He told investigators he was by the little boy's side in hospital when she died, but now police have revealed they are examining CCTV footage to confirm his story.

Staying quiet: Jonah Shacknai, 54, has made no public comment about the death of his girlfriend, Rebecca Nalepa, who was found hanging naked at his mansion

At least 15 detectives continue to investigate the 'very bizarre' death of Miss Nalepa, who was found hanging naked from a second-floor balcony, her
hands and feet bound with orange electrical cord, on July 13.

The following Sunday Max Shacknai died 
at a San Diego children's hospital, almost a week after he tumbled down 
the mansion's stairs while
Miss Nalepa was looking after him.

The 32-year-old was buried in a private ceremony on Saturday. Police do not expect to have toxicology results from her autopsy for several weeks.

She was found by Mr Shacknai's brother, Adam, who was staying in the mansion's guesthouse to offer support after Max's accident.

The millionaire has told investigators he was holding a desperate vigil by his son's bedside at the time of Miss Nalepa's death, but now police have revealed they intend to examine surveillance footage from Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.

A police source told Radar Online: 'Investigators want to confirm details of what Jonah, Adam, and Dina 
[Jonah's second wife, and Max's mother], have revealed to them.

'Jonah 
maintains that he was at the hospital when Rebecca's body was found. 
This is a very fluid investigation.'

Mr Shacknai, 54, issued an emotional statement after Max died, but has made no public comment about Miss Nalepa's death.

He is said to be 'in seclusion' in 
Arizona, where his $700m-a-year cosmetics firm is based, while police 
continue to search his luxury mansion in the affluent San Diego suburb 
of Coronado.

Tragic death: Max Shacknai died in a San Diego hospital days after tumbling down the stairs at his father's 27-room mansion while in Miss Nalepa's care

Denise D. Resnik, who has known Mr Shacknai for more than ten years after working with him at an autism charity, told the Los Angeles Times: 'He's a good friend. He's dedicated to his family. It's tragic from every dimension.'

Friends are seeking to play down the image of Mr Shacknai as a poor husband and ruthless businessman which has emerged over the last two weeks, particularly after Arizona police revealed he had a violent and stormy relationship with his ex-wife, Max's mother Dina Romano.

During his divorce from his first wife, Kimberley James, a psychologist said he was defensive and could have some unresolved anger problems.

But he added: 'It was quite apparent to me that his children are most important to him and he loves them dearly.'

Marriage plans: Pharmaceutical tycoon Jonah Shacknai reportedly told friends he 'wanted to spend the rest of his life' with Rebecca Nalepa

Before their marriage descended into vicious rows, he and Ms Romano couple were admired and respected within the community of Scottsdale, Arizona, for their charity work with special needs children.

Mary Clark, executive director of the project, said: 'They're both so passionate about children and just very loving people.'

A source told Radar that Mr Shacknai 
has been interviewed 'extensively and exhaustively by law enforcement, 
about Max's death, and Rebecca's.

'Jonah has been extremely cooperative with authorities.'

They
have not ruled whether Miss Nalepa's bizarre hanging was homicide or 
suicide, nor have they formally linked her death to Max's accident.

Appalling accident: Max Shacknai fell down these stairs and later died in hospital. Police are now reviewing CCTV footage at the children's facility in San Diego

Her sister, Mary Zahau-Loehner, has vehemently denied that her sister would have killed herself out of grief for the little boy.

Miss Nalepa had given up her job as an ophthalmic technician last year to devote herself to Mr Shacknai and his children.

She had also been married before, and in May she reverted to her maiden name of Zahou.

Despite his two divorces, friends said he as determined to start again and spend 'the rest of his life' with Miss Nalepa.

Sources
said: 'It was a very serious relationship. There was a lot of love 
there. Jonah had every intention of proposing to Rebecca.'
