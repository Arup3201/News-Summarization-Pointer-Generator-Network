 

The White House and the Defense Department denied on Friday multiple reports that an ill-fated attempt to rescue American photojournalist James Foley and other American captives in Syria failed because President Barack Obama took too long to green-light the mission. 

Retired Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer, a CIA-trained former former U.S. military intelligence officer, told WMAL radio in Washington on Thursday that a Special Forces effort might have succeeded if the president had acted more quickly.

'I'm hearing from my friends in the Pentagon,' Shaffer said during the talk radio stations' morning show. 'They are giving [Obama] every single option way ahead of time.'

'And let me give you a little secret here: The reason that raid into Syria failed to get Foley and those guys was because the president dragged his feet. He waited too long, the intel got stale, and by the time we actually gave the "go" word it failed because we just didn't react quick enough.'

The accusation is 'not true,' a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council tweeted Friday. Special Forces, the press officer said, conducted the operation 'as soon as the President & nat sec team were confident it could be carried out successfully.'

Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon's press secretary, tweeted that the mission was 'conducted flawlessly' and 'on a timeline that ensured [the] best chance of success.

The Pentagon confirmed last week that a summertime mission failed to rescue any hostages because they had been moved prior to American commandos' arrival.

The Sunday Times of London reported a similar development earlier this week, also citing Shaffer and another unnamed Defense Department source.

'I'm told it was almost a 30-day delay from when they said they wanted to go to when he finally gave the green light,' Shaffer told the Times. 'They were ready to go in June to grab the guy [Foley] and they weren't permitted.'

The Times story quickly went viral via RealClearPolitics.

On-the-record denials from two senior Obama administration officials, however, will put the White House in an embarrassing position if the claims are proven to be true.

A second source told the Times that 'the White House constantly goes back and forth on these things.'

'These people are a bunch of academics who endlessly analyse stuff and ordering up another deep-thinking paper but can’t decide what to order for lunch.'

Foley's death was broadcast worldwide in a video distributed online by terrorists affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) two weeks ago.

In the footage, a masked Islamist militant is seen beginning to decapitate him. The video then cuts to a gruesome image of Foley's head sitting atop the rest of his dead body.

Some analysts have suggested that the video was captured long ago, and that Foley has been dead for more than a year.

If true, it would also throw the Obama administration's intelligence-gathering capabilities into doubt since it would have been impossible to rescue him a month ago.
