Mandi O'Rourke died in a swimming pool at a friend's house in April 

A nurse died after collapsing into a swimming pool at her friend's house while four times the legal drink drive limit. 

Mandi O'Rourke was suffering a heart disease when she was invited back to the property of a friend in April for a swim. 

The 47-year-old from East View, Cramlington, had been drinking when she collapsed into the water at the property in Kenton, Newcastle.

Toxicology reports found the nurse who worked at Nuffield Hospital would have been four times over the legal drink drive limit when she died. 

Pathologist Jennifer Bolton said she had died from a combination of the effects of alcohol and her disease. 

'She died from heart disease and the effects of alcohol. It just so happened she was in a swimming pool at the time it occurred,' she said. 

The inquest heard how Miss O'Rourke had been drinking with friends at the Jubilee Pub in Kenton when they went back to the property. 

'From the CCTV you see all of them in the pool having a drink,' said Detective Constable Dave Croskery of Major Crime. 

'Mandi got upset with her boyfriend and left the pool in a swimming costume.'

'She came back about 20 minutes later wearing her bra and knickers when two others were still in the pool. They left, leaving Mandi in the shallow end.

'You see her having an event and she goes face down and drifts towards the deep end and tries to grab the end. 

'The footage then shows her sink to the bottom.'

 Assistant coroner Andrew Hetherington recorded a conclusion of natural causes.

Speaking after the inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre, Miss O'Rourke's family said she will be 'greatly missed'. 

'We are very distraught and we still haven’t recovered,' said her father, Michael O'Rourke. 

'Grieving takes a long time, particularly when it’s your daughter. You don’t expect to see them go before you. 

'You expect them to see your lifetime through. You expect the shoe to be on the other foot. She’s going to be a great miss.'

'She used to come to mine most Sundays for lunch and I still look out of the window to see where she is. I know she won’t be there but it would be nice if she did come.'

The 67-year-old said his daughter was committed to her job as a theatre nurse, and that her heart disease had come 'out of the blue'. 

'She came from a family of nurses - both myself and her mother were nurses.'

A coroner concluded natural causes as the cause of death. A pathologist added the woman died of the effects of alcohol and heart disease and that she happened to be in a swimming pool at the time of her death

Paying tribute to his daughter, Michael O'Rourke (right) said she would be 'a great miss' and that her heart disease had come 'out of the blue' 

'At 18 she started to train at the Freeman Hospital as a nurse and she then worked at the Nuffield in Jesmond.

'She enjoyed her job as a theatre nurse and she was very good at it.

'She had suffered problems with her back and had discs removed and she was on the sick at the time of her death.'

'The heart disease was totally out of the blue.'

'She worked in an operating theatre and was working all day with other doctors and nurses and no one picked anything up because there was nothing to pick up. 

'Anyone could be suffering from it and unless we have regular check-ups we don’t know.'
