Manchester United fear Robin van Persie could be on the sidelines for a further six weeks with a repeat of a thigh injury he suffered at Arsenal.

David Moyes desperately needs his principal striker back and, as problems mount, on Friday he confirmed that Wayne Rooney would also miss Saturday's clash against Swansea.

But the more serious concern for Moyes is Van Persie, the manager admitting that he ‘would not want to put a date’ on the 30-year-old’s return even after sending him to Holland to work with a fitness coach at PSV Eindhoven.

Such is the unpredictability of the injury the specialists have told United he could return sooner than feared.

But Sportsmail understands there is a chance Van Persie could take much longer to recover. He suffered the same injury at Arsenal in December 2007 and did not play in the Premier League between December 16 and March 9, making only 15 appearances.

The Dutchman has not been available to Moyes since December 10 and yesterday United’s manager also revealed that Rooney has been sent to Egypt for warm-weather recuperation with a member of the club’s fitness staff, trying to be fit to face Chelsea on January 19.

On Van Persie, Moyes said: ‘We are trying to get him back but it’s a thigh strain similar to the one he had at Arsenal so we are having to manage it correctly.

‘He has been to Holland to work with the guy he knows over there and we are doing everything we can. There are some injuries you can play with but not the thigh.’

Explaining the situation with Rooney, Moyes added: ‘Wayne has been sent away on a sort of hot-weather break. I always hoped I would be able to do it at some point in the season and his groin has not quite recovered yet.

'We have sent a fitness coach with him and he is away with his family to give him a break. He will continue working because I want to keep him in good shape, and hopefully we’ll get him fit for Chelsea.’

Moyes came in for fresh criticism yesterday from someone who would have been considered a loyal servant of United; former academy director Eric Harrison.

Asked if he thought Moyes could turn it around, Harrison replied: ‘At this moment in time, no.’ Harrison was also critical of changes to the coaching staff.

Moyes brought in Steve Round, Phil Neville, Jimmy Lumsden and Chris Woods from Everton as replacements for Mike Phelan, Rene Meulensteen and Eric Steele. Speaking to Sky, Harrison said: ‘In hindsight it does look like a mistake, I don’t want to criticise anyone but I’ve got to be honest. They certainly should have kept the staff. They shouldn’t have brought so many in from Everton.’

Moyes responded, saying: ‘I asked Rene to stay at the club so it wasn’t as if I came in here and said, “Let’s get rid of everybody”.

‘I’ve kept all the other backroom staff. I don’t think that’s got anything to do with it at all.’

Meanwhile, beleagured Moyes was charged by the FA yesterday over comments about match officials after last week’s Sunderland defeat. Moyes said his team are ‘having to play them as well as the opposition at the moment’.

Meanwhile, left-back Fabio da Silva could be on his way to Cardiff City for the rest of the season with former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer eyeing up a move.
