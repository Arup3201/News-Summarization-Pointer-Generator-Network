Late night snacking has led to British women becoming bigger than their French counterparts claims chef Raymond Blanc

Late night snacking, too much wine and not cooking with butter has led to British women becoming bigger than their French counterparts claims chef Raymond Blanc.

Mr Blanc, who moved to the UK in the 1970s, says it is Britain's culture which has led to females being among the heaviest in Europe. 

'One glass of wine a day is better than six! Again, cook with butter  - just use a little and most important, do not eat after 7 o'clock in the evening,' he says.

'That's a big tip because most people eat more at night and that when you put the weight on. Be ware of your snacks as well,' advised the French chef who has recently been teaching Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins how to cook.

'Yes French woman do get fat, but it seems that there is a food culture in France which often defines how people eat and in France we eat well.'

'Eating well, a varied diet, which omits bacon and eggs every morning or six glasses of wine at night, means a better diet,' he told Gransnet.

'My mother Maman. She's 91 and when I was a boy she gave me a deep understanding of food, its purity and nobility, and how it celebrates life,' he said

Mr Blanc, who credits his mother as his culinary inspiration, also said she was a fine example of a petite French woman.

'My mother Maman. She’s 91 and when I
 was a boy she gave me a deep understanding of food, its purity and 
nobility, and how it celebrates life,' he told MailOnline.

Mr Blanc, whose Oxfordshire restaurant boasts two Michelin stars, spent Christmas with his mother after his Russian born fiancee Natalia Traxel called off their engagement late last year.

It was only in October the chef said this country’s attitude to food was changing, with a growing appreciation of the importance of quality produce and that France was 'losing its strong food culture, while Britain is gaining one'.

Despite saying British women are fatter then the French, last year Raymond Blanc attacked a Great British Bake Off contestant because she was 'thin'.

The chef sparked anger when he wrote on Twitter, mistakenly referring to Ruby Tandoh as the show’s winner on the night of the final.

He tweeted: 'The Great British Bake Off. Not much skills, female tears and a winner so thin who makes me doubt of her love for great cooking, baking.'

But Tandoh hit back, writing: '@raymond-blanc ‘female tears’?! and what has anyone’s size got to do with it?

'I don’t care if you’re a patisserie king - don’t be an idiot.'

Blanc later apologised, tweeting co-host Paul Hollywood: 'Apologies if I upset people this morning. I would like to congratulate you on a show. Best Rb xx'

Figures in recent years have shown that British women are now officially the most overweight in Europe.

A quarter are obese – so fat it threatens their health – according to alarming figures.

But it is not just British women - men are doing almost as badly, with more than one in five classed as obese.

Experts are especially concerned by the young age at which so many women here are developing serious weight problems.

Fifteen per cent of women in Germany are obese, while they are slimmer still in France (12.7 per cent) and Italy (9.3 per cent).

Only
 the U.S. and Ireland, which are not included in the Eurostat league 
table, have higher obesity rates in the developed world.

Neville Rigby, director of policy and public affairs at the International Obesity Forum, said the British led the field in obesity.

But he added that in almost all developed countries two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese.

‘Levels of fatness are increasing all the time,’ he said.

‘They go from overweight to obesity and affect more than 60 per cent of adults in most countries'.

Butter:  Catherine Collins, Principal Dietician At St George's, London would disagree with Raymond Blan's advice about cooking with butter.

She says: 'Butter is rich in saturated fat and this is a major health concern. It is our high saturated-fat intake that helps make cardiovascular disease our most common cause of death, claiming 193,000 lives a year. Saturated fat increases your risk of heart disease by increasing blood cholesterol levels, particularly the 'bad' LDL cholesterol.

'Men should consume no more than 30g of saturated fat a day, and women no more than 24g to protect our heart health, and I believe we should try to stick to this.

'Two teaspoons (10g) of butter provide more than 5g of saturated fat. Swapping to a polyunsaturated or olive-oil-based spread reduces that amount to a mere 1.5g. So choosing between butter or a spread can greatly influence your saturated-fat intake.'

Eating late at night:  The TV chef says snacking late at night can contribute to weight gain - and he is correct.

Scientists warned last year found that eating while we stay up to browse the internet or watch a late film is likely to be contributing to rising obesity levels.

The research came after tests on mice. One group were allowed to eat only during an eight-hour period, while a second group could graze on what they wanted all day and night. US researchers found that even though the two groups were eating about the same amount of calories, those who ate at set times during the day did not become obese.

They suggest that those who ate when they wanted to gained weight because they disrupted their body clock – and they believe the same principle may apply to humans.

Drinking alcohol: Raymond Blanc says drinking six glasses of wine at night can led to weight gain.

Official guidelines state women should not regularly drink more than 2-3 units a day - that’s no more than a standard 175ml glass of wine (ABV 13%). The average glass of wine has 140 calories. 

Bacon and eggs for breakfast every day:  The Michelin-starred chef says women should not eat bacon and eggs every morning, but a high-fat breakfast of bacon and eggs may be the healthiest start to the day, a study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham study. 

'The first meal you have appears to program your metabolism for the rest of the day,'said study senior author Martin Young, Ph.D., associate professor of medicine in the UAB Division of Cardiovascular Disease.

This study suggests that if you ate a carbohydrate-rich breakfast it would promote carbohydrate utilization throughout the rest of the day, whereas, if you have a fat-rich breakfast, you have metabolic plasticity to transfer your energy utilization between carbohydrate and fat.'
