He's the jealous uncle who lured the king to his death before being murdered by his own henchmen in a plot of Shakespearean violence.

Now The Lion King's villain Scar is back - and he's prowling the vast Maasai Mara game reserve in Kenya.

Spanish photographer Jose
 Eugenio Fernandez Tores, 43, spotted the dead ringer for the Disney character at the 580 square mile reserve complete with a cut across his eye - albeit on the wrong side of his face.

Even so, the lion - who looks like he has been in a terrible fight - bears a distinct resemblance to Simba's covetous uncle from the hit film, voiced by Jeremy Irons, who lured Mufasa beneath a stampede of wildebeest.

'I couldn't believe it,' said Mr Tores. 'What are the chances of a lion having a scar on its eye just like from The Lion King?

'He was really trying to woo a lioness whilst I was there. He was roaring and showing his ferocity, just like Disney's Scar would.'

Dead ringer: There may be a few differences - the mane isn't as dark, and the scar is on the wrong side - but otherwise this lion is a spitting image of Disney villain Scar, with the snarling personality to match

Damage: It is not known how the lion in the Maasai Mara sustained the injuries to its face

Haughty: The Disney villain (right) overthrew Mufasa to take Pride Rock as his own before being betrayed

Aggressive: In the Disney film, the lion coveted the throne and would do anything to get hold of it...

Lonely: ...But in real life, the scar-faced lion seemed far more interested in calling out to find a mate
