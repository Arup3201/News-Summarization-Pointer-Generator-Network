The father of an unarmed man shot by a transit worker can sue the officer after a Tuesday court ruling.

A federal appeals court in California said Tuesday that the father of Oscar Grant can sue the Bay Area Rapid Transit officer responsible for the 22-year-old’s 2009 shooting death on an Oakland, CA, train platform during a fight. Five of Grant’s friends were arrested during the dust up.

The lawsuit was made possible when the court struck down a claim by former officer Johannes Mehserle that he was acting in his official capacity, granting him police immunity, according to the San Jose Mercury News.

‘It is possible, after weighing all the facts, that the officers committed no constitutional wrongs,’ Judge Mary Murguia wrote in her ruling. "But our task at this stage... is instead to construe the facts in the manner most favorable to the plaintiffs, who have a right to their day in court,’ she continued.

Mr. Mehserle was convicted in 2010 on involuntary manslaughter in a trial that had to be held in Los Angeles, CA, because a fair trial would have been difficult due to widespread media coverage of the incident. He served 11 months in prison.

Video of the white officer shooting 
the unarmed black man in the back as he lay face down on the train 
platform was viewed by millions and led to widespread demonstrations.

The
officer contended during the trial that he thought he had pulled out 
his Taser, not his gun, when he fired at Mr. Grant, and lawyers for 
other involved officers claimed the officers were acting within their 
rights in their response to fighting at the train station.

Mr. Grant’s father and the five friends arrested during the New Year’s Day incident all sued, saying the officer had to pay damages for the unarmed man’s death, as well as for violating the civil rights of his five friends, according to the paper.

The lawsuit alleges that the group of six was targeted and mistreated as a result of racial profiling in violation of their civil rights, according to the paper.

It will now be up to a civil court to determine if Mr. Mehserle was justified in shooting Mr. Grant, and if the other men’s civil rights were violated. BART cannot be sued as an institution, according to the paper.
