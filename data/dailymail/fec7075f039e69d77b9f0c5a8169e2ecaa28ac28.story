World Snooker has announced the death of former Tour player Lee Spick.

The sport's governing body said Spick had passed away at the age of 34 after a liver-related illness.

Spick was on snooker's main tour from 2000 to 2010, twice reaching the final qualifying round for the World Championship.

He dropped off the Tour but returned on a two-year card in 2013, but played in just two tournaments before his death.
