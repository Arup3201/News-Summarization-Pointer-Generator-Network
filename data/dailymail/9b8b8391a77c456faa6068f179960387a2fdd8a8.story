Hackers are pooling their funds to offer a bounty of over £10,000, bottles of booze and other prizes, for the first person that can crack the iPhone 5S’s Touch ID fingerprint sensors. 

IsTouchIDhackedyet.com, the creation of security researcher Nick DePetrillo, said it is hoping to help Apple identify bugs that it may have missed.

Arturas Rosenbacher, founding partner of Chicago's IO Capital, has already donated $10,000 (£6,200) to the hacking competition.

‘This is to fix a problem before it becomes a problem,’ he told Reuters. ‘This will make things safer.’

Robert Hansen, technical evangelist at Whitehat Security, said: 'Hackers pooling their funds together to encourage other hackers to find vulnerabilities is a very interesting turn of events.

'Hackers widely dislike fingerprint technology. The security world has been trying to tell companies for years that biometrics like fingerprints are the passwords that can never change and that you leave them every place you touch and therefore they should not be used in any application where devices and fingerprints are collectively in the presence of an attacker at the same time.

'Most importantly to the consumer, if it turns out that fingerprint scanners are as easy to break on Apple devices... it allows attackers who have physical access to the phone to unlock the device, including all of the secrets held within.'

The iPhone 5S scanner works by using a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger. It then uses a 'laser cut sapphire crystal' to take a high-res image scan and the Touch ID software in iOS 7 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not

button, the phone is unlocked.

Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books.

crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7
detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not.

All fingerprint information is 
encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip.

Among
those getting ready for the hacking contest is David Kennedy, a former 
U.S. Marine Corps cyber-intelligence analyst who did two tours in Iraq 
and now runs his own consulting firm, TrustedSec LLC.

‘I am just waiting to get my hands on it to figure out how to get around it first,’ the founder of the DerbyCon hacking conference told the Thomson Reuters Global Markets Forum this week.

‘I'll be up all night trying.’

The Touch ID sensor is built into the 
premium phone's 'home' button and can be used to unlock the phone, as 
well as pay for shopping and apps automatically - effectively replacing 
the need for a password or PIN.

Speaking
at the launch event in Cupertino, Apple's senior vice president of 
worldwide marketing Phil Schiller said: 'Half of smartphone customers do
not set up passwords. [Touch ID] is an easier and more fun alternative.

'It uses key you have with you everywhere you go. Your finger.'

Apple's Phil Schiller, pictured, explained the scanner was secure because prints are saved to the chip, and not online. Yet security researchers are concerned that prints can be stolen from anywhere

But security engineer Charlie Miller said it could take fewer than two weeks for Kennedy or some other smart hacker to get around the new lock.

All major electronics products are subjected to similar scrutiny as new features are rolled out, including devices from Google Inc, Microsoft Corp and Samsung Electronics Co.

For example, in 2012, Charlie Miller led a team that demonstrated techniques for taking over smartphones running Google's Android software through their use of near-field communications, or NFC, a wireless technology used for sharing data or making purchases at point-of-sales terminals.

Bugs are often disclosed by ‘white hats’- hackers who unearth flaws and report them so manufacturers can repair them, preventing criminal exploitation.

Kennedy said he needs to examine the new iPhone to figure out how to best attempt an attack.

He said his choices include hacking the software that analyses the fingerprint data, or physically opening up the phone and connecting it to a custom-built device that would impersonate Apple's fingerprint reader.

He added that it might be possible to lift a user's fingerprint from elsewhere on the device and somehow make a clone of it.
