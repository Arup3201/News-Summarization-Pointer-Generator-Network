The Duchess of Cornwall visited the Kentucky Derby race ground yesterday on the final day of her U.S. tour with Prince Charles. 

Dressed in an elegant blue suit and beige overcoat, Camilla cosied up to prize-winning horses and petted  donkeys as she strolled around Churchill Downs, the site of the famous horse racing event.

Her visit to Louisville concluded the royal couple's four-day tour of north America.  

Kneeling in the Churchill Downs paddock yesterday afternoon, Camille fed and stroked two of the donkeys to honour the work carried out by Brooke, the world's largest equine charity of which she is president.

Camilla visited Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on the last day of her tour of the U.S. with Prince Charles yesterday afternoon

Elsewhere Prince Charles delivered a rousing speech about climate change, describing the 'engulfing threat' of global warming. The couple were welcomed to the state by its most famous export, Muhammad Ali, who praised them as 'the greatest'. 

Too poorly to meet them in person, the boxing legend addressed the heir to the throne in a letter. 

It was read aloud following a choir performance of My Old Kentucky Home at the Cathedral of Assumption. 

'As you travel back to your homeland, we hope you know how much this city respects and admires the many contributions you have made in the world,' Ali wrote in the message read by Mayor Greg Fischer.

'We think you are the greatest,' he signed off. Earlier Prince Charles spoke of the looming threat of climate change and the importance of conservation. 

Addressing the congregation, he said: 'If we wish to maintain our civilization, then we must look after the Earth. In failing Earth, we are failing humanity.' 

The Kentucky Derby is one of the largest horse racing events in the world. During her visit the Duchess of Cornwall greeted some of the animals that may take part

The Duchess of Cornwall has long campaigned for the care of horses and is a patron of the British Equestrian Federation 

The couple also took time on their final day to visit the Food Literacy Project at Oxmoor Farm in Louisville where Camilla found herself making pizzas with a group of youngsters who insisted on topping it with carrots and radishes.

Camilla joined children from Louisville, Kentucky who were part of a 'from field to fork' group learning not only how to grow their produce but cook it.

After helping the youngsters plant a rhubarb plant in a plot at Oxmoor Farm, an 18th century estate, she sat around a table in the open air and helped nine-year-old Fred Meadows create the savoury treat.

The children use seasonal produce in their cooking so radishes, kale and carrots were added to the pizza - but they were cooked after the Duchess had left the group.

Earlier the Duchess had visited a community project called Neighbourhood House, running since 1896 in a disadvantaged area of Louisville.

Originally rich members of the community moved into the neighbourhood, with affluent and poor members living together and raising standards.

She chatted to Jason Logsdon, 11, who comes to the centre every day to do homework or sport and he told the Duchess he wanted to join the CIA when he is older.

He said: 'I knew who she was but not much about her, but she was awesome, she's cool.'

Jockey Pat Day joined the Duchess at Churchill Down. He is immortalised at the famous racecourse by a bronze statue (above) 

Camilla took time out to chat with Mr Day who was inducted to the National Hall of Fame for racing in 1991. The following year he won the Kentucky Derby

'We think you are the greatest,' he signed off. Ali, 73, famously nicknamed 'The Greatest,' has been battling Parkinson's disease for years, and in December checked into hospital with a bout of pneumonia.

Charles, 66, and Camilla, 67, spent most of the US visit in Washington, where they arrived on Tuesday and met President Barack Obama on Thursday at the White House.

In Louisville he spoke of the looming threat of climate change and the importance of conservation. 

Addressing the congregation at the Cathedral of Assumption he said: 'If we wish to maintain our civilization, then we must look after the Earth. In failing Earth, we are failing humanity.' 

He also greeted schoolchildren outside the Kentucky Center for African American Heritage, with teenagers lining the street to catch a glimpse of the royal couple.  

Their visit to Kentucky rounded off their U.S. tour. Earlier this week Prince Charles received an award for his contribution to conservation at ceremony in Washington D.C.

He was awarded the ICCF Teddy Roosevelt Award for Exceptional Leadership in Conservation before offering his own pearls of wisdom from the stage. 

The gala is billed as the most important annual conservation gathering of U.S. members of Congress, foreign heads of state, ambassadors, corporate executives, conservation legends, celebrities, and NGO and civil society leaders to celebrate conservation successes.

Addressing the gala dinner, Charles praised the United States for its long term commitment to the environment, citing President Franklin Roosevelt who sought to protect the nation's wildlife and open spaces. 

In a rousing speech about the environment yesterday, the heir spoke of the dangers of global warming and climate change
