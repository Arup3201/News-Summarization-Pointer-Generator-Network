A huge rise in employment means that 
there are more people in work than every before, with almost 30million 
Britons holding jobs, it was revealed today.

And the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance has fallen to its lowest level in nearly two years.

But wages continue to fall in real terms, with pay rises lagging far behind the rate of inflation.

Climbing: The number of people in work is at a record high as the economic recovery continues

Positive: The unemployment rate fell to 7.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2012

Figures from the Office for 
National Statistics showed that unemployment fell by 14,000 in the final
quarter of last year to a total of 2.5million, or 7.8 per cent.

In addition, 12,500 fewer people claimed jobseeker's allowance, with the total of 1.54million being the lowest since June 2011.

Overall,
29.73million held some sort of job, the largest number ever recorded - 
71.5 per cent of the UK population. That is a rise of 154,000 between 
September and December.

There was a shift in employment from part-time jobs to full-time, reversing one of the recession's most worrying trends.

The number of people in full-time work increased by almost 200,000, while there were 43,000 fewer part-timers.

Boom: Employment is up and joblessness continues to fall despite the poor state of the economy

Sluggish: Wages are growing more slowly than inflation, leading to a real-terms pay cut for most

Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and 
Pensions Secretary, pointed to ONS statistics showing that the number of
people out of work for more than a year had fallen by 15,000, to 
879,000.

'The fall in 
long-term unemployment is particularly welcome and shows that the 
training and support we are offering is helping people move off benefits
and into work,' he said.

'These figures show another big increase in full-time jobs, half a million more British people in work over the past year and more women in employment than ever before.

'The UK is now ahead of many of its international rivals when it comes to cutting unemployment and creating jobs which is so important as we compete in a global race.'

However, there was less good news in 
the youth unemployment figures, as it emerged that 11,000 more young 
people were out of a job.

In total 974,000 16- to 24-year-olds are currently looking for work - a youth unemployment rate of 20.8 per cent.

The governor of the Bank of England believes that more extraordinary measures are needed to boost the economy, it emerged today.

Sir Mervyn King and two other senior Bank figures voted for further quantitative easing at this month's meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee.

However, their proposal to inject another £25billion in an attempt to re-start economic growth was voted down after the other six members of the committee opposed it.

The MPC decided instead to use more targeted measures to return the UK to growth, after the national economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the last quarter of 2012.

QE - which essentially amounts to printing money - has been controversial because of its potential to cause or worsen inflation.

And average wages also continue to flag, rising just 1.4 per cent over the past year to reach £472 per week, roughly £24,600 per year.

Since inflation is standing at 2.7 per cent by the CPI measure, that means the average worker has less spending power now than a year ago.

Wage growth has been lower than inflation since mid-2008, which marked the start of the recession which has devastated the British economy.

The average employee works 31.9 hours per week, up slightly from the year before.

Shadow
work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said: 'Today's fall in the 
headline rate of unemployment is welcome but it is now clearer than ever
that British workers are paying the price to get a job or keep a job.

'People
have now taken an average £1,200 pay cut since the election because 
jobs are so hard to come by and today we see there's still more than 
five people chasing every vacancy.

'Youth
unemployment has risen yet again, back towards the million mark, the 
number of women out of work has gone up and long-term unemployment is 
still far too high.

'What Britain now needs from next month's Budget is an industrial-strength back-to-work programme to match the crisis we face.'

Lagging: Wage growth has been lower than inflation since the start of the recession in 2008

Good news: The number of unemployed people has fallen but wages continue to rise slowly

Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, said: 'That we have mass unemployment of two and a half million five years into this recession is waste on a grand scale.

'To this must be added the millions in enforced temporary and part time jobs and those massively underemployed.

'What is tragic is that there is no light at the end of the tunnel as we are in the middle of a triple dip recession.'

The CBI welcomed the figures, but expressed worries that lagging wages 'show we are not out of the woods yet'.

Neil Carberry, director for employment and skills, said: 'It is particularly good that so much of this month's jobs growth is driven by full timers, given worries about under-employment.'

Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said: 'The UK jobs market continues to astound. We are in the middle of both a jobs boom and a pay slump as jobseekers struggle to gain or retain employment in a stagnant economy by pricing themselves into work.

'This is unlike anything seen in this country since the Second World War, with the economy using more and more people at falling real rates of pay to produce a static level of output.'
