Billie Jean King understands that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and that is how she is taking the advent of the International Premier Tennis League in Asia.

The American legend was not just an inspirational driving force behind the growth of women's tennis, but also the playing of the sport in the team format, having first founded the concept with her own league in the mid seventies.

On Sunday night she was bringing her Mylan World Team Tennis event to London's Royal Albert Hall, at a time when players joining up under the banner of a group outfit is suddenly all the rage.

King says she is flattered by the International Premier Tennis League copying her competition's format

Her opposing captain in the charity event was Sir Elton John, who actually penned his classic Philadelphia Freedom song in 1975 as a favour to her, providing a theme tune for one of her professional tennis teams.

King has looked at the four-team league currently going in Asia, and might be excused for envying the nouveaux riches of the format, given the eyewatering sums they are paying the players taking part.

Roger Federer is reliably said to be collecting at least £2.5 million for his two appearances in India while Andy Murray's fee for representing the Manila Mavericks in three matches is believed to be around £1m. 

Even the veterans taking part, such as Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras, are reckoned to be pocketing well in excess of £500,000.

Before the London event - featuring the likes of John McEnroe, Tim Henman, Andy Roddick and Martina Hingis – King spoke of her delight that her longstanding concept appears to be proliferating.

It does not trouble her that her own version in America, which takes place after Wimbledon, cannot afford to attract the world's top players in the way that the IPTL has done.

'I'm thrilled, it's a form of flattery,' she said. 'We are celebrating our fortieth year next summer. This is fantastic. It's really important to support tennis, whatever the level. The IPTL is taking professional tennis to new cities with great players.

'I have always been in favour of the team format, always thought that children signing up to tennis should be in a team, they like to be with their friends. Team sports are the biggest in the world, that was my background originally and that of my brother, who played Major League Baseball.'

In a sport where players are often resistant to any form of innovation, those participating in Asia and the Middle East have clearly been enjoying themselves and embracing the concept (as they ought to with its rewards).

It is a lively product and television-friendly, fitting in to modern tastes, with players showing their personality. It is certainly hooking people in a way that is making the worthy week-in, week-out event the WTA and ATP Tours look very samey by comparison.

What nobody in the game is quite sure is how the IPTL is making its sums add up, and how it will go forward after what looks already to have been a successful first year purely in terms of the product.

But then in light of the deep pockets of some of the franchise owners they might not have to balance the books in the same way that more regular events do.

McEnroe is also a supporter of the team concept: 'You've got to remember that in the seventies team tennis was packing out stadiums, with players like Jimmy (Connors) and Bjorn (Borg) taking part,' he said on Sunday afternoon.

'I think the key is this having its own time slot. Maybe the game changer part of this is that the schedule is a bit less year-round than it was. It's got a bit more chance of being a success.'

The least that the IPTL is going to do is fuel the current debate in tennis, traditionally resistant to change, about how it needs to broaden its appeal to cater more for modern demands.

Sir Elton, who for twenty years has captained his team in charity matches against that of King, is also a keen advocate of the team format despite his enthusiasm for the game's traditions. His sporting loves are football and tennis and, as he pointed out, he goes back a long way with both.

He joked 'I'm so old I can even remember (Jaroslav) Drobny beating (Ken) Rosewall at Wimbledon in 1954.'
