Exit: Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown leaves the Leveson Inquiry at the High Court in London after a controversial morning of evidence

Gordon Brown yesterday accused Rupert 
Murdoch of lying on oath in his claim to the Leveson Inquiry that the 
former prime minister ‘declared war’ on his media empire.

Mr Brown said an alleged ‘unbalanced’ 
phone call the tycoon claimed was made after The Sun switched its 
backing to the Tories did not take place.

‘This call did not happen. The threat was not made. I find it shocking. There is no evidence that it happened,’ he said.

In a statement issued last night by 
News Corporation, Mr Murdoch stood by his evidence.

But in extraordinary
testimony to the judicial inquiry into media standards, Mr Brown also 
insisted he did not give consent for The Sun to publish a story about 
his son’s diagnosis with cystic fibrosis.

He said he was ‘shocked and surprised’
that Mr Murdoch had told the inquiry he had said that in allowing his 
newspaper to support the Tories, he had ‘declared war on the 
government’, leaving him ‘no alternative but to declare war on your 
company’.

Mr Brown rejected evidence from the 
newspaper’s former editor Rebekah Brooks that he and wife Sarah had 
agreed to the publication of details of the illness of their son, 
Fraser, though he appeared to accept that it was not obtained by 
accessing his medical records as previously claimed.

And he accused The Sun of distorting 
reports on the war on Afghanistan to make it appear that he had ‘evil 
intentions’ and did not care about British troops.

Mr Brown’s claims are serious because they charge Mr Murdoch and Mrs Brooks of not telling the truth at the inquiry.

Witnesses must swear on oath to give truthful evidence, and could be charged with perjury if they have not done so.

Evidence: Gordon Brown has started giving evidence this morning as he was drawn into the Leveson firestorm

Under oath: Mr Brown has made several sensational claims today in his evidence and denied much of Rupert Murdoch's evidence was true

Battle: Gordon Brown and Rupert Murdoch have been engaged in an incredible war of words with the former Prime Minister accused of making a 'threatening' phone call to the media mogul when The Sun dropped support for Labour in 2009

The former PM’s evidence was his first
major public appearance since he spoke in the Commons a year ago to 
attack the ‘criminal-media nexus’ he said had been created by the 
Murdoch empire.

A defiant Mr Brown appeared determined
to contradict Mr Murdoch’s evidence in which the former prime minister 
was alleged to have vowed to go to war with his company.

‘I am alleged to have acted in an 
unbalanced way. This conversation never took place. I am shocked and 
surprised that it should be suggested,’ Mr Brown said.

He said he had spoken to Mr Murdoch 
weeks after The Sun’s switch to the Tories in 2009, but the conversation
was about Afghanistan.

In her evidence, Mrs Brooks told the 
inquiry that Mr Brown had been ‘extraordinarily aggressive’ in response 
to The Sun’s coverage of the conflict. But the former PM dismissed that 
claim.

He also denounced claims in The Sun 
that he fell asleep at a memorial service, insisting he was bowing his 
head to pray, and also attacked its coverage of a letter he sent to the 
mother of a dead soldier that was said to have contained 25 mistakes.

He added that he felt he did not have the support of The Sun ‘for almost all the time that I was prime minister.

'You have to remember that when I 
started off as prime minister, the first thing The Sun did was try to 
ruin my first party conference by launching their huge campaign about 
how we were selling Britain down the river and demanding not only a 
European referendum but demanding that I support it,’ he said.

Cosy relationship: Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah with Rupert Murdoch and his wife Wendi shortly after Mr Brown became Prime Minister in 2007, but their relationship eventually turned sour

An emotional Mr Brown also rejected 
Mrs Brooks’s evidence that he and his wife gave permission for the paper
to reveal that their son Fraser had cystic fibrosis.

‘I don’t think there’s any parent in 
the land who would have given explicit permission for this story,’ he 
said.

Mr Brown sought to undermine The Sun’s evidence that the story was
obtained legitimately.

He cited a statement from John 
Wilson, chief executive of NHS Fife, who said they accepted that a 
member of its staff had spoken, without authorisation, about Fraser’s 
medical condition.

Mr Wilson also insisted ‘there was no inappropriate access to the child’s medical records’.

Mr Brown struggled to explain why he and his wife continued to socialise with Mrs Brooks after the story was published.

Mrs Brown held a slumber party to mark
Mrs Brooks’ 40th birthday at Chequers at which Rupert Murdoch’s wife 
Wendi was also present. The Browns also attended Mrs Brooks’ wedding.

‘Sarah is one of the most forgiving people I know,’ Mr Brown said. ‘We had to get on with the job of doing what is expected.’

Responding to Mr Brown’s evidence, a News Corporation spokesman said: ‘Rupert Murdoch stands behind his testimony.’

A News International spokesman said: 
‘We welcome the fact that NHS Fife have today said that they believe 
there was ‘no inappropriate access’ to the medical records of Gordon 
Brown’s son.

‘The Sun stands by previous statements issued on the matter.’

The Leveson Inquiry was repeatedly told by Mr Brown that he knew nothing about his aides plotting against Tony Blair and other Cabinet ministers yesterday – sparking incredulity from party insiders.

The former PM refused to accept any responsibility for unleashing the ‘forces of hell’ as his spindoctors were dubbed.

Mr Blair, Alistair Darling, Alastair Campbell and other leading Labour figures have repeatedly insisted that Mr Brown’s special advisers Charlie Whelan and Damian McBride engaged in aggressive briefings against Mr Brown’s internal enemies.

Denial: Gordon Brown told the Inquiry that he never briefed against Tony Blair

The judge chairing the inquiry into press ethics said today that it was 'essential' that cross-party political support for his investigation was 'not jeopardised'.

Lord Justice Leveson said the 'politics of personality' and any impact inquiry evidence might have on current political issues was not his focus.

The judge told the Leveson Inquiry in London that nothing he said or did was intended to limit any investigation by Parliament.

He was speaking prior to hearing evidence from former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown.

'The purpose of the inquiry is not to challenge the present Government or the decisions taken in the recent past but to look at the much wider sweep of history, across party political boundaries,' said Lord Justice Leveson, a Court of Appeal judge.

'To the extent that there are political questions that Parliament wishes to investigate, I repeat that nothing I say or do is intended to limit or prevent that investigation taking place.'

But Mr Brown insisted he neither sanctioned nor was even aware of the briefings.

Mr Brown dismissed as ‘tittle tattle’ 
the repeated assertions that Mr Whelan and later Mr McBride engaged in 
systematic anonymous briefings against his rivals.

‘I wouldn’t say that 
at all,’ he told the inquiry. ‘It would be without my knowledge and 
without my sanction.’ Asked if they ever briefed against Mr Blair, he 
said simply: ‘No. If they did so it was without my authorisation.

Mr Campbell has told the inquiry there was a ‘real problem’ with Mr Brown’s special adviser in the Treasury, Charlie Whelan.

Mr Brown’s chancellor, Alistair 
Darling, has accused Mr McBride and Mr Whelan, who was by then with the 
Unite union, of briefing against him in the financial crash of 2008. 
‘The forces of hell were unleashed,’ he said.

But Mr Brown said yesterday: ‘One 
thing I can say to you that is absolutely clear ... is that nobody in my
position would have instructed any briefing against a senior minister, 
and Alastair Darling was a friend of mine as well as a senior 
colleague.’

Mr McBride was forced to resign in 2007 after it emerged that he had passed smear stories about senior Tories to a website.
