This is an unusual moment when an elderly man crossed paths with one of the world's deadliest snakes and casually kicks it out of the way on a beachside walk.

The footage captures an Australian man, whose identity is unknown, strolling along a picnic area, believed to be at The Surf Club Nobby's Beach in Queensland.

But when he stumbled across the eastern brown snake laying on the grass besides the concrete foot path, he boots the coiled reptile with his left foot.

A man was filmed kicking at a venomous snake at a Queensland beach

The man is seen taking a few steps back to take a better look at what he's fighting with as the enraged snake rears up to strike back as it puts its head up to stare at its attacker.

But within seconds, the man kicks it again, but this time with his right foot and into its head, causing it to flip back in the air.

It appears the man looked satisfied with his victory and he continues to walk off, while the defeated snake is seen slithering further away into the grass and away from the footpath.

The video, which was filmed through a mobile phone, was posted onto YouTube by user 'jotunboy81' and has received over 350,000 views.

A caption along the video explained: 'A beautiful Eastern Australian Brownsnake (2nd deadliest in Australia (world?) had just passed us on the beach and it climbed up the concrete wall and into the food serving area close to the beach,' jotunboy81 wrote.

'This old hook came along, kick´s (sic) it right in the face on his way to the toilet. There is absolutely no reason to go around it,' the post continued.

'No one was harmed in this event and the snake crawled back to it´s own habitat close by.' 

The video has also received a significant amount of comments on YouTube.

Matt Booth wrote: 'The snake looked pretty unimpressed by this guys lack of fear over it after the second kick. If there was ever a look of resignation on a snake, this is what it looks like.'

Ricardo Ferrando posted: 'This old man is actually my grandfather, I've only just been told about this by my uncle and couldn't stop laughing when I saw it, not to (sic) much has ever scared or worried granpa as you can all see.'

The eastern brown snake is the species responsible for the most deaths caused by snakebites in Australia, according to Reptile Park. 

'Although, with the advent of efficient first-aid treatment and antivenom, there are now usually only one or two deaths per year.'
