Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki said on Thursday he is 'mad as hell' about allegations that VA hospitals put patients on secret waiting lists.

'I could use stronger language here, but in deference to the committee, I won't,' Shinseki said in testimony before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs on Thursday.

Shinseki - who is a veteran himself - called the allegations 'completely unacceptable' if true and promised that the VA would take corrective action if necessary.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki told members of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee that he was 'mad as hell' about allegations that up to 40 patients may have died because of delayed treatment at an agency hospital in Phoenix, Arizona

CNN recently reported that 40 veterans died after being put on secret waiting lists for care by a Veterans Affairs hospital in Phoenix, Arizona.

'I would say that 40, there's more than that that I know of, but 40's probably a good number,' a former doctor at the facility told CNN.

VA rules require hospitals to see veterans within two weeks to a month of their request for an appointment.

In order to skirt the rules, employees of the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System created an alternative system of scheduling that made it look like veterans were being seen in a timely manner when they weren't.

Wait times for appointments often took more than six months, and in one case took 21 months, the doctor said. 

At another hospital in Cheyenne, Wyoming, employees were also instructed to 'game the system' by listing veterans' request for an appointment on a day where appointments were available instead of the day they first made the request, CBS reported last week.

Shinseki told the Senators on Thursday to his knowledge, the secret waiting lists were not used at VA hospitals across the country.

'I'm not aware other than a number of isolated cases, where there is evidence of that,' the retired four-star general said, but he noted it 'behooves' the VA to take a look into its hospitals to make sure.

Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health Robert Petzel told Senators the VA is 'working continuously' to find out what VA sites are using the secret lists.

VA acting Inspector General Richard Griffin said on Thursday that the IG's office was looking into multiple lists provided to them, including some provided via hotlines after the Phoenix deaths became national news.

'The number 40 that's been wildly reported in the press, does not represent the total number of veterans we're looking at,' he said.

The list it is currently looking at has only 17 individuals, he said, and their investigation has shown so far that while all of the veterans on the list died, it was not because they were denied care in a timely manner by the VA.

There was a delay in care, the VA's standards were not met, and there was 'some patient harm,' but to draw the conclusion between that and death, has been 'tenuous,' John Daigh, VA assistant Inspector General, said.

In addition to the investigation underway by the VA Inspector General, Shinseki said his department would also be doing its own review of its practices.

On Wednesday, President Obama announced that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors would oversee the VA's internal audit.

'While we get to the bottom of what happened in 
Phoenix, it's clear the VA needs to do more to ensure quality care for 
our veterans,' President Obama said in a statement. 'I'm grateful that Rob, one of my most trusted advisors, 
has agreed to work with Secretary Shinseki to help the team at this 
important moment.'

Shinseki said he welcomed Nabor's participation on Thursday, saying he has known Rob and his family for a long time.

He said the VA would let the IG finish his review of the department's 
practices before jumping to conclusions about the level of care other VA
 hospitals provide.

The embattled VA Secretary said he would not leave his position until he'd completed his personal mission to improve health care for veterans or the President of the United States asks him to resign.

Veterans look on as U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki testifies before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing on VA health care, on Capitol Hill

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called for an independent investigation into the VA on Thursday morning.

'Our veterans are our heroes and they deserve better than a White House insider-led investigation,' he said. 'Yet again the White House is trying to pass off a scandal as an isolated incident when in fact it continues to grow every day.'

Disabled American Veterans Legislative Director Joseph Violante also called on an outside investigation in his testimony to Congress on Thursday, while noting his organization stands behind Secretary Shinseki.

During Thursday's hearing, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Jerry Moran questioned whether the VA's internal audit was anything more than 'damage control.'

How long will it be before there is a different approach or attitude at the VA to solve the problem, Moran asked. 'What is is this really going to accomplish?'

Moran, who chaired the VA subcommittee on health in the House before being elected to the Senate in 2010, said a two-week investigation by the VA that doesn't look at every one of the its facilities cannot be considered a thorough review.

Sen. Mark Blumenthal asked Shinseki why he hadn't gotten the FBI involved in the investigation yet, as the manipulation of health records is a crime and the VA is clearly understaffed.

'I will work with the IG to make that available to him if that is his request,' Shinseki told Blumenthal.

That's something that is your job to do as VA Secretary, Blumenthal told him, especially in light of the of 'false statements to the government.'

Several senators asked Shinseki and Petzel what would happen to the VA employees involved in the cover up if the allegations turned out to be true.

Shinseki again said he wanted to wait for the IG to finish his report before deciding if employees of the Phoenix hospital and other hospitals allegedly behaving in inappropriate behavior would be fired.

'There is a process here, Senator,' Shinseki told Alaska Sen. Mark Begich. 'Let me not get ahead of it.'

'I don't know whether that's the appropriate level' of discipline or not, Petzel said of terminating employees involved.

Shinseki said that other employees who have engaged in inappropriate behavior have either retired, been let go or reassigned in the past.

American Legion National Commander Dan Dellinger (center) has called for Shinseki's resignation over the scandal

The American Legion has called for Shinseki's resignation over a long list of grievances against the VA. The veterans organization has created a map of all the VA facilities that contributed to veterans' deaths by withholding necessary care.

'I accept that there are places that are 
listed here where we have had adverse events,' Shinseki said when confronted with the  American 
Legion's map.

The American Legion says that a number of veterans have died of serious diseases after being put on a wait list for simple procedures like a colonoscopy.

'When are things going to get better?' Dan Dellinger, American Legion National Commander, told the committee.

Carl Blake, national legislative director for Paralyzed Veterans of America said his organization wants to give Shinseki the 'opportunity to get it right' before it calls for his resignation.

'If that means people have to be fired, so be it,' he said.

The Phoenix facility's director, associate director and another director have been put on leave, VA acting Inspector General Richard Griffin said on Thursday.

He said the investigation, which a group of 185 health inspectors have been working on for three weeks, could take until August to complete.

'Remember part of this review could result in criminal charges being brought,' he told Senators who wanted to know why his office expected it to take so long.
