Prince Charles fears becoming king will condemn him to ‘imprisonment’ – denying him the freedom to pursue his favoured causes.

Despite being seen as itching to ascend the throne, he is already feeling the weight of duty, according to an extraordinary profile published today.

Aides say the prince is desperate to get as much of his charitable and environmental work done before ‘the prison shades’ close.

Profile of a prince: Friends and associates of Charles have provided a fascinating insight of his life for an article in TIME magazine

Royal duties: Prince Charles and his wife Camilla leave the baptism of his first grandchild Prince George yesterday at St James's Palace

The surprise insight into his thinking comes from interviews with more than 50 of his friends and associates.

Catherine Mayer had extensive access 
to Charles for her TIME Magazine front cover story, The Forgotten 
Prince. She visited royal residences in England, Scotland and Wales and 
followed him to meetings and on official visits.

Charles, 64, is for the first time 
deputising for the 87-year-old Queen at a Commonwealth summit in Sri 
Lanka next month but Miss Mayer says he ‘accepts these additional duties
 joylessly’.

She writes: ‘He prefers not to focus on his accession, 
which, after all, means losing his mother. And far from itching to 
assume the crown, he is already feeling its weight and worrying about 
its impact on the job he has long been doing.’

Charles tells the US magazine he 
intends to make the most of his inherited position: ‘I’ve had this 
extraordinary feeling, for years and years, ever since I can remember 
really, of wanting to heal and make things better.

‘I feel more than anything else it’s 
my duty to worry about everybody and their lives in this country, to try
 and find a way of improving things if I possibly can.’

The magazine highlights suggestions that the monarchy could skip a generation in favour of William.

But Charles says: ‘If you chuck away too many things you end up discovering there was value in them.’

The article also reveals:

Speaking to the Mail yesterday, Miss 
Mayer said: ‘I don’t think the prince sees becoming king as prison. It 
is a loss of freedom and a loss of time.

‘It is not that the Crown is a shackle but what it does is eat up his time.

‘He is often described as being 
impatient to be king but what he’s really impatient to do is to get as 
much as he possibly can done before he is king.’

She said it is clear that Charles will
 increasingly take on more of his mother’s work but his passion lies 
elsewhere and he is ‘incredibly eager to get as much done as he possibly
 can’.

Miss Mayer added: ‘The thing he is 
really passionate about is the life he’s carved out for himself and 
everything else he does as a sense of duty.’

In Time magazine she adds: ‘The Queen,
 at 87, is scaling back her work and the prince is taking up the slack, 
to the potential detriment of his network of charities, initiatives and 
causes.’

Charles serves as patron of 428 
charities and has founded more than 25. Miss Mayer says he has been 
pruning and merging his causes into the 16 strongest that he can be sure
 will flourish with less of his attention.

Charles says: ‘Obviously, these things have grown like Topsy over the years, as I’ve seen what I feel needs to be done.

‘I couldn’t do it all at once. I couldn’t at Highgrove just do the whole garden in one or two years. Bit by bit, you go round.’

At Birkhall, the prince’s royal 
residence on the Balmoral estate, Charles told Miss Mayer: ‘We’re busily
 wrecking the chances for future generations at a rapid rate of knots by
 not recognising the damage we’re doing to the natural environment, 
bearing in mind that this is the only planet that we know has any life 
on it.’

William, Kate and their baby George 
paid Charles and Camilla a visit that day and the prince told Miss Mayer
 he now takes joy in his ‘wonderful wife’.

‘And of course now a grandson, which 
is what this is all about. It’s everybody else’s grandchildren I’ve been
 bothering about, but the trouble is if you take that long a view people
 don’t always know what you’re on about.’

Miss Mayer says Charles has been 
plagued by the perception that he is aloof and indulged but in reality 
he is a ‘passionate philanthropist’. She says he is one of the world’s 
most prolific charitable entrepreneurs and what one friend called ‘an 
amplifier of messages and a conductor of ideas’.

In the article Charles says of his 
charity, the Prince’s Trust: ‘A few people are lucky enough to know 
exactly what they want to do.

‘But there’s a hell of a lot of others
 who don’t really know and may not be obviously academic.’ Miss Mayer 
writes: ‘He seems unaware that he’s also describing his own struggle.’

A Clarence House spokesman said of the
 suggestion that he viewed his future duties as ‘joyless’: ‘This is not 
the Prince of Wales’s view and should not be attributed to him as he did
 not say these words.

‘The prince has dutifully supported 
the Queen all his life and his official duties and charitable work have 
always run in parallel.’

Timeless classic: Prince Charles in a Silver Cross

They are considered a little too cumbersome by most 21st century parents.

But William and Kate have stuck with royal tradition and ferry George around in a Silver Cross pram.

Both the Queen and Prince Charles spent some of their early months in a Silver Cross pram.

Invented in 1877 by William Wilson, the baby carriages became hugely popular by the 1960s.

Television footage of the Queen pushing her children around royal estates in one helped turn them into a ‘must have’ baby accessory for the wealthy.

The prams were often spotted being pushed by Norland Nannies wearing their distinctive brown uniforms.

But as smaller and lighter prams and buggies came on the market, the tradition Silver Cross model faded in popularity.

Buckingham Palace last night declined to revealed which model William and Kate opted for.

They might have chosen the £1,450 Silver Cross Balmoral pram which is described as the ‘ultimate classic pram’ by its designers.

Many families would struggle to afford one – let alone get it through their front door.
