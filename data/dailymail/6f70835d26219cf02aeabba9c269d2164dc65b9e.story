A Florida mother-of-three  will not be charged  after forcing her  son to dress up in girls' clothes and put makeup on as punishment for wetting the bed while she took photographs.

One picture, which shows the 10-year-old boy with tears streaming down his face, was posted and shared on Facebook before a relative brought it to the attention of law enforcement officials.

Prosecutors said Monday that there was not enough evidence to charge Christle Prado and her roommate Keith Driscoll, who were both arrested in December for inflicting physical or mental injury during an act of child cruelty.

A neighbor said Driscoll forced the boy, who was crying as others pointed and laughed at him, to run outside the house while wearing the dress and makeup, according to Click Orlando. 

Prado told police Driscoll came up with the punishment, and that the boy was only dressed in the clothing for a couple of minutes.

She said she didn't stop it from happening because she did not want to ruin her living situation with Driscoll, who is also her landlord, but admitted to sending photographs to her boyfriend in a private Facebook message. 

Angela Starke, a public information officer from the Orange/Osceola County State Attorney's Office, said a child cruelty charge requires evidence that the crime caused discernible and substantial impairment to the child's 'intellectual or psychological capacity' and their ability to function 'within the normal range'. 

The boy, who has a documented medical condition, and his two siblings are now in the custody of their grandmother Sherry Morden, who said the abuse has gone on for far too long. 

She told Click Orlando: 'Tears were just pouring from his eyes, and I guess she seemed to think it was OK.

'I told him that it wasn't his fault and he didn't deserve it. He shouldn't be punished for something that is not his fault.'

She said the pair also forced the boy to take a cold shower and threw ice at him.

The Florida Department of Children and Families confirmed Prado has been investigated for previous incidents but said they could not elaborate. 

Department representative Kristi Gray said the case against Prado was now closed. 

'I can't disclose the findings of our case as they are not public record,' she said. 'But the children remain in protective custody with relatives.' 

According to Gray, any prior history with the Department of Children and Families does not become public unless there is a death attributed to child abuse or neglect.
