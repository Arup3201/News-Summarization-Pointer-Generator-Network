It is one of the most celebrated racing games of all time. However, some were left slightly disappointed when Gran Turismo 6 was announced for the PlayStation 3.

With Sony's latest console, the PS4, boasting superior specifications, many saw GT6 as a perfect launch title to show off the new hardware.

Instead, Polyphony Digital have done the
 reverse - aiming to not only provide the best visuals on the PS3, but 
to show that the aging console still has a long life ahead of it.

Legendary: The Goodwood Festival of Speed hill climb will feature in Gran Turismo 6

Real or fake? One of the famous corners at the Goodwood Festival of Speed race course

Can you tell the difference? Crowds cheer on each side of the track

Gran Turismo 6 features 71 layouts of
 33 tracks, 1200 vehicles and - although primarily the same engine as GT
 5, adaptive tessellation is used to give the cars a next-gen sheen.

Earlier this month, it was announced that the Goodwood Festival of Speed hill climb course will feature in the game.

The
 1.16 mile of road that runs through the Earl of March's family home's 
grounds is legendary in the racing ranks - with a wide variety of 
vehicles climbing the hill infront of up to 185,000 spectators.

Below
 are images from the latest Goodwood Festival of Speed - three are 
in-game, three are real-life. But will you be able to tell the 
difference?

Iconic: but is this the real Goodwood or is it rendered using the in-game graphics engine?

Straight back at you: A part of the course where you can build some speed up

Legendary: More than 180,000 spectators converge at the Festival of Speed every year

Too hard to tell: Is this a real photograph or a screenshot taken from the latest Gran Turismo game?

Gran Turismo 6 is slated for release on November 28.
