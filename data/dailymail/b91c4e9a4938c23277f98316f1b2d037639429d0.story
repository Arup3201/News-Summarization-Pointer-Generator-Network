Brazen prisoners are boasting about their cash, drugs and weapons stashes on Instagram, an investigation has found.

The inmates were caught flaunting their hauls on social media despite the cannabis, £50 notes and knives - not to mention mobile phones - being banned.

Hundreds of photos by prisoners were found in a probe by Channel 4 News, which comes amid claims Britain's jails are becoming more dangerous because of a shortage of staff.

Dangerous: Prisoners are openly flaunting possession of drugs and knives on the photo app Instagram

Mountain of evidence: One image contained a copy of the Sun newspaper from November 21 with a prisoner ID card, £10 notes, extra-long rolling papers for joints and buds of cannabis wrapped in green kitchen bags

Most of the images were posted on the social media site Instagram, popular with teenagers, celebrities and lovers of fashion and food.

Some of the accounts were set to private, meaning only an approved network of friends - including other prisoners - could view them. Others were viewable by anyone on the internet.

In a smartphone video posted on Instagram, one inmate asks another to pay him back - to which the prisoner responds by peeling off a 'pinky' (a £50 note) from a wad of cash.

With his cell TV blaring behind him the prisoner puts the rest of the money in his pocket, joking: 'I can buy food with this'.

Contraband: Some of the profiles were publicly available, while others we part of a private network

One photo obtained in the investigation shows an inmate preparing a cannabis joint next to a deadly lock knife at least two inches long.

Another shows a large kitchen bag full of cannabis buds lined up next to rolling papers, £10 notes, a copy of the Sun newspaper from November 2014 and even a prisoner ID card.

Cash and mobile phones are banned in prisons, as are illegal items such as weapons and drugs.

In 2013 the number of phones confiscated in jails was 7,451 - despite prisoners who are found with smartphones having up to two years added to their sentences.

The number of drug seizures has risen by a fifth in just three years amid concerns there are no longer enough prison officers to keep inmates in check.

There were 3,700 drug seizures in 2010-11 but almost 4,500 in 2013-14, according to the Ministry of Justice.

Prison Officers' Association chairman Peter McFarlin told Channel 4 News security has become 'impossible' due to lack of staff:

'It's extremely disheartening for professional prison staff, but they need resources to be able to combat that sort of activity,' he said.

'Since 2010, 7,500 frontline operational prison staff have left the service, 3,500 in one calendar year to 2014 - that means... basic searching is not taking place.'

He added proactive investigations based on tip-offs or covert information would have to be ditched.

One former prisoner, however, said corruption was to blame.

The recently-released inmate, who blogs under the name Alex Cavendish, wrote: 'The main way that [drugs] come into prisons is through staff.

Wad: One photo obtained by Channel 4 as part of its investigation appeared to show a wad of £20 notes

'The amount that prisoners or visitors can smuggle in is minute compared to the amount that is available on the prison wing.' 

A Ministry of Justice spokesman told Channel 4 News: 'We will never tolerate the use of contraband in prisons and will continue to clamp down on the use of any illicit items or substances.

'Prisons already use a comprehensive range of robust searching and security measures to detect items of contraband with intelligence-led searches, body searches, use of x-ray machines, metal detectors and CCTV surveillance cameras, as well as body orifice scanners all helping to tackle the use of mobile phones.

'Any prisoner who is caught or suspected for smuggling prohibited items will face tough consequences, which could include prosecution and a further sentence, closed visits, up to 42 days added to their time in prison or confinement to their cell for up to 21 days with no association time.' 

The full investigation airs on Channel 4 News at 7pm.
