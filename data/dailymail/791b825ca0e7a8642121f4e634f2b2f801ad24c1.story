If Belgium's training session on Thursday was anything to go by, they are heading to Brazil with full intensity this summer.

But it is arguable that Marc Wilmots' side were a little too aggressive, with Jan Vertonghen and Mousa Dembele hobbling off the pitch in Stockholm.

The Premier League pair were pictured battling for the ball, with both needing an ice pack on their ankles afterwards.

Worry: Tottenham defender Vertonghen was forced to hobble off with an ankle injury

Concern: Dembele's foot is being iced after training... the World Cup is just two weeks awayÂ 

It is as yet unknown if any serious injury was picked up, but both will be hoping to jet off for the World Cup to help a well-tipped Belgian side progress.

Eden Hazard and Co beat Luxembourg 5-1 in their first pre-tournament friendly, with Romelu Lukaku scoring a hat-trick and Adnan Januzaj making his anticipated debut.

They face Sweden on Sunday and Tunisia next weekend, before taking on Algeria, Russia and South Korea at this summer's tournament.
