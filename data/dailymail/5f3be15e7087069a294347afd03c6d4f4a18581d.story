These poignant last scenes filmed by Lynda Bellingham show her playing a cancer stricken mother opposite her own son.

In a moving film, which echoes her own real life experience, the actress weeps as she reveals to her son she has been diagnosed with cancer in Too Close for Comfort 2.

In one particularly emotional scene Miss Bellingham, who lost her battle with cancer on October 19, cries for more than a minute as the news of her diagnosis sinks in.

Director Donna Taylor revealed that the actress's real-life son Michael Peluso, who played her on-screen child Sam, was on set during the emotional performance and had to leave the room at points.

Ms Taylor told the Mirror: 'Lynda was the most wonderful actress but I swear they were real tears.

'Despite putting on a brave face most of the time, she often said there were times at night when she used to get quite scared. And this was that moment.

'Michael couldn't bear the sound of her crying and to see her upset, so he had to go in the other room. He couldn't cope with it. Everyone was crying afterwards.'

With echoes of her real life resolve, during the film, a sequel to Too Close to Comfort, Ms Bellingham's character Mary tells Sam that she has cancer but vows to fight on.

She says: 'I am not going to die. I am a fighter.'

The poignant moment was filmed just weeks after Miss Bellingham had told her son that she was battling cancer in real life and scheduled around her gruelling chemotherapy sessions.

Ms Taylor and the late actress had worked together on Too Close for Comfort in 2011 and had wanted to make a sequel together. But after Miss Bellingham was diagnosed with cancer, Ms Taylor said the direction of the film was influenced by her real life battle, writing her fight with the disease into the story line.

She said she had hoped that the role would help her psychologically.

'That's why we wrote the character as an upbeat person who would face cancer head on.' 

Miss Bellingham insisted that some of the proceeds from the low-budget film would go to the charity Action Against Cancer in a bid to raise awareness of the disease.

The director - who also wrote and starred in the film, about a man's quest to track down his real mother and the consequences it brings - said the upbeat and energetic actress and presenter would offer people cups of tea in between filming, despite them begging her to take it easy.

The final scenes of the film were shot in June just two months before Lynda's own cancer had spread to her lungs and liver. 

Lynda died in her husband Michael’s arms on October 19 at the private London Clinic where she’d received treatment.

Her death came just ten days after the publication of her memoirs, There’s Something I’ve Been Dying To Tell You, in which she revealed for the first time she had terminal bowel cancer and spoke about the pleasure of acting opposite her son in the film. 

She wrote: 'Some of the scenes became very emotional – it was hard enough to play that role but the storyline was all too real for me, it was my life – but it was a joy to work with my son.'
