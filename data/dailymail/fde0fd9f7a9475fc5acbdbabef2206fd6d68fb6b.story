Disgraced General David Petraeus should go back to Iraq to help curb turmoil engulfing country, according to Senator John McCain.

'I would suggest perhaps sending David Petraeus and Ambassador [Ryan] Crocker back over [to Iraq],' Mr McCain said to CNN anchor Candy Crowley.

'[Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri] Al-Maliki trusts them.'

Mr Petraeus, 61, also served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his 2012 resignation, after news of his affair with biographer Paula Broadwell became public.

Mr Crocker served as the US ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009, as well as ambassador to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2012.

He retired in 2012 due to unknown health reasons, NPR reported at the time.

Mr McCain also said he believed Iraq 'is not a lost cause' and that the United States may be able to offer logistical support.

The 2008 U.S. presidential candidate for the Republican ticket also called former Defense 
Secretary Robert Gates 'obviously very frustrated' and criticized the 
release of Gates' new book as part of a series of remarks on foreign 
policy on Sunday.

Mr McCain made the remarks as part of an interview with Candy Crowley on CNN's 'State of the Union' on Sunday.

In the interview he said that he would send backAmbassador [Ryan] CrockerÂ  to Iraq. He also said that former Defense Secretary Robert Gates 'was obviously very frustrated' and criticized the release of Gates' new book

He
 said that if he were Mr Gates, he would have waited to release the book, 
'Duty: Memoirs of Secretary at War,' which is said to include sharp 
criticism of President Obama's handling of the war in Afghanistan.

'I think, frankly, I might've -- if I
 had given him advice -- I would've waited,' McCain said.

'As far as 
waiting until it's over in Afghanistan, I wouldn't have done that. But 
maybe [in] retrospect, a little longer than now.'

'He's
 obviously very frustrated and felt -- which by the way surprised all of
 us who know him -- and he's decided to really kind of let loose.'

Mr McCain however, described Mr Gates as 'one of the finest public servants I have known.'

In the book Mr Gates
 strongly criticizes President Obama's passion for the nation's 
military - contrasting his attitude strongly with that of his 
predecessor President George W. Bush.

In
 his forthcoming memoir Gates claims that he never once saw 
Obama become emotional during a Medal Of Honor ceremony - claiming that 
his coldness was in stark contrast with Bush, who would regularly 'well 
up'.

Declaring himself to 
be 'disturbed' by this 'absence of passion', Gates goes onto say that 
the only time he saw his commander-in-chief become animated during his 
time in the administration was during Obama's push to repeal 'don't ask,
 don't tell.'
