The picture-sharing social media boom via sites like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram means the pressure is on to look good online.

And with celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley constantly bombarding our social media feeds with picture perfect 'selfies', there has never been a more important time to impress on the net.

And now, an app which promises to do just that has hit the market and become a best-seller as image conscious users rush to enhance their looks.

'Face Tune' Photoshop app that whitens teeth, removes spots and even fill in bald patches has become an iTunes bestseller

Face Tune is a £1.99 photo editing app designed to help you edit your portrait photographs into 'perfection'.

Not only can you remove spots, improve skin texture and enhance eyes, but you can also fix grey hair, reshape your face and even fill in bald patches.

The £1.99 app promises to smooth out skin and even wrinkles to give a flawless visage

Want to give celebrities a run for their money? This new app promises to give you a spot-free complexion

You can also whiten teeth, remove wrinkles and elongate or shorten a face entirely before instantly sharing the retouched photos to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Flickr or Tumblr, or via email.

Most of the tools are easy to use and you simply have to zoom and pan, then use your finger to paint on the effect.

'Facetune is different,' said Zeev Farbman, Lightricks CEO.

It promises that you can retouch your face, change your eye colour and even fill in bald patches and reshape your face with the click of a button

'Unlike other apps, it gives any user the ability to achieve high-end, realistic looking results, comparable only to what a professional can achieve on the desktop with Photoshop.'

He then explained how this was achieved: 'We have a strong background in the academia, which we used to take the most exciting, state of the art technologies, that were never seen on mobile devices, and integrated them into a product in the most user-friendly way.

'With the tiniest bit of effort, everyone can get great looking photos of themselves.'

And it seems that our image conscious society are rushing to improve their cyber image because it is currently the third most popular app on iTunes just behind What's App and the Catchphrase game.

One user wrote: 'Best editing and retouch app I've ever had! Amazing, definitely worth the money!'

Another added: 'I don't know what I'd do without this app! I've never looked so good.'
