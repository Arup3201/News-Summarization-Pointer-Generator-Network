MPs are set to probe Britain's use of controversial spydrones after a report found pilots are poorly-trained and being 'pushed to the limits'.

The Defence Select Committee will examine Britain's increasing deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) after an investigation by the Military Aviation Authority found surging demand is 'constraining the length of time available to train and qualify' new operators.

It found soldiers with no past experience could be in charge of piloting a spydrone after just 25 hours flying time.

The Reaper is the Air Force's first 'hunter-killer' unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and is designed to engage time-sensitive targets on the battlefield as well as provide intelligence and surveillance

A review was ordered after the crash of a Hermes 450 (H450) unmanned aircraft at Camp Bastion, the main British base in Afghanistan, last year.

Operated by the Army personnel with 
the Royal Artillery from Kandahar, the surveillance drone's engine cut 
out in mid-air after overheating.

Failings identified could lead to 
another incident unless action was taken, said investigators. 'Unless 
urgently addressed, the contributory factors identified ... are likely 
to continue to affect H450 operations and may contribute to a further 
accident,' the report said.

Investigation: Chair of the Defence Select Committe James Arbuthnot says the body will look into the UK's use of drone planes to kill insurgents

The report raised concerns about the 
selection of drone operators, their training and development, and their 
poor knowledge of air- traffic control rules.

Air Marshal Tim Anderson, head of the
aviation authority, demanded more than 60 changes to the operation of 
Britain's nine H450 drones after reading the report.

All have been accepted and are being 
implemented. But he warned ministers that the flaws that were exposed 
made for 'uncomfortable reading'.

'The findings may be interpreted as pointing to an organisation pushing the limits of organic air competence,' he wrote.

About half of Hermes pilots had to be
taught from scratch for each tour of duty. 'The truncated training 
pipeline is producing H450 pilots and commanders to a standard that is 
"just enough, just in time",' the report said.

Members of the Commons' Defence 
Select Committee revealed yesterday they would probe the deployment of 
UAVs in the fight against the Taliban.

As well as the H450, the UK has five 
£10million Reaper drones armed with missiles currently operated by RAF 
personnel from 39 Squadron at Creech Air Force base in Nevada.

But five new UAVs will be controlled 
above the skies of southwest Afghanistan by airmen sitting at computer 
screens 4,000 miles away in the UK by XIII Squadron.

The Military Aviation Authority report does not touch upon the Reapers.

Unveiling the inquiry James 
Arbuthnot, the Tory chairman of the cross-party committee, said there 
were 'issues about the remoteness of the dealing of death that are 
important'.

The investigation will look at ’the 
effect of changes in the interpretation of the law on the prosecution of
operations, and the use of remotely piloted aircraft'.

Labour is also calling for a new set 
of rules to govern the deployment of the unmanned aerial vehicles - 
especially when engaged in missions to kill Afghan insurgents.

A new batch of drones, known as squadron 13, were put into action at an MOD ceremony last month

Shadow Armed Forces Minister Kevan Jones said: 'We must clarify the rules, given the significance and spread of the technology

'Whether valid or not, there is a 
public perception that unmanned technology is shrouded in secrecy, which
increases the potential for its demonisation.'

He spoke out as MPs debated Britain's involvement in drone warfare.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has 
revealed that the UK's Reapers had flown more than 39,000 hours and 
fired at least 334 laserguided Hellfire missiles and bombs.

But it says only four Afghan civilians have been killed in strikes since 2008.

Military chiefs say the drones give 
allied forces an edge over the Taliban by monitoring an entire 
battlefield and carrying out strikes against insurgents.

But human rights campaigners claim 
the American-built aircraft kill and injure large numbers of civilians 
and breach international law.

The military is likely to use unarmed
UAVs to undertake reconnaissance patrols around the coast of the UK and
for Nato operations rather than replacing the RAF's Nimrod spy planes.

A spokesman for the Drone Wars UK 
pressure group, which has raised concern over Britain's use of UAVs, 
said: 'The inquiry is a welcome step forward, but as always the devil is
in the detail and we look forward to seeing the proposed scope and 
remit of the inquiry.'
