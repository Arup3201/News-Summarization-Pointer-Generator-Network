With a population of just 11million (almost 29 times less than the 318m people living in the USA) you may think that Belgium can barely compete with America when it comes to the realm of culture, heritage and sporting success.

Yet Belgium head into their round of 16 World Cup clash against the USA in Salvador on Tuesday evening as favourites to progress.

The small European country are competing on an even keel with their opponents on the field and as Sportsmail demonstrates below, their unique culinary and cultural tastes also shape up nicely against the financial might and global domination of their US counterparts.

Which country takes the glory on the pitch in Salvador remains to be seen, but here's who wins the match-up off it.

Football Pedigree The
 USA have only twice progressed beyond the round of 16 at the World Cup –
 the first was over 84 years ago at the 1930 World Cup in Uruguay and 
the second at the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea. The group 
stage of that inaugural World Cup also marks the last occasion that 
Belgium were defeated by the USA, with the Americans emerging as 3-0 
winners.

The
 Belgians' record at the planet’s premier competition is not much more 
impressive, for they have also managed to navigate their way into the 
final eight of the World Cup on one occasion. In 1986 in Mexico, their 
progress was halted by a Diego Maradona’s Argentina in the semi-finals, 
who would go on to win the competition.

WINNER: Draw

Other sporting Heroes Belgium
 has not been a hotbed of sporting talent but 
highlights have come in the shape of female tennis stars Justin Henin 
and Kim Clijsters, who won a combined eleven grand slam titles in their 
singles’ careers. They also boast arguably the greatest cyclist of 
all time, with the brilliant Eddie Merckx (below) winning the Tour de France on 
five occasions at the beginning of the 1970’s.

The USA, however, have an
 array of globally recognised superstars, from NBA legend Michael Jordan
 to the world’s most inspirational sportsman Muhammad Ali. When you 
throw in America’s outstanding golfers, Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus, 
and athletes such as Jesse Owens, it becomes a list with which no 
country in the world would be able to compete.

WINNER: USA

The WAGs

The
 US captain Clint Dempsey's wife Bethany boasts a master’s degree and is
 an educational psychologist. Oh, and she also posed for a Sports 
Illustrated shoot in 2010 wearing only body paint.

Earlier this year, the Belgian winger revealed that his other half could
 make the final decision over his future with the London club, telling 
Canal+: ‘If my wife was to say: "Honey, I'd like you to go to PSG (Paris Saint-Germain)", I 
would have to take it into account.’

FoodThe
 fast-food industry is not the preserve of the Americans, despite the 
industry bringing in an extraordinary $191billion in 2013. 
Indeed, French fries, so popular in the states, in fact originate from 
Belgium. Well, according to the Belgians anyway. 

The history books claim 
that they were sliing up and frying potatoes as early as the 17th century
 as an alternative to fish when the rivers became icy and impenetrable 
in the winter.

Nowadays, French fries remain a national delight in 
Belgum, where there are an abundance of friteries, where chips are the 
main delicacy on offer. Moules-frites (mussels and chips) is the 
country’s favourite dish, offering a variation on the America's 
hamburger and French fries or the British fish and chips.

WINNER: Belgium

Beer Belgium is renowned for its beers, with American author Joe Stange even writing a book called ‘Around Brussels in 80 beers.’ Our favourite is Duvel, founded in 1871 and described as ‘well-hopped, fruity and exceptionally aromatic’. Jan-Leonard Moortgat opened a brewery with his wife and a process of trial-and-error created a beer that has become one of the most popular in Belgium.

Duvel (translated into English as ‘devil’) takes ninety days to brew and has also made inroads into the USA market. Westvleteren 12 and Rochefort also come highly recommended.

Over the Atlantic, Bud Light is the market leader, bringing in sales just under $6million in 2013, according to a survey by bizjournals.com. Coors light, Budweiser and Miller Lite all trail in its wake.

Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo is certainly confident, tweeted his US counterpart: ‘Hey @BarackObama, I am betting some great Belgian beers that our @BelRedDevils will make it to the quarter final! :-) #ComeOnBelgium #BEL'

WINNER: Belgium

Politics The Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo handed in his resignation to the King at the end of May but he has enjoyed reasonable levels of popularity during his period in power. He is seen as a symbol of Belgium’s progressive state, as the first Prime Minister of non-Belgium descent (he is the son of Italian immigrants) while he has become the first openly gay Prime Minister in Europe.

The USA, of course, have their own history-making President, after Barack Obama was voted in as the country’s first African American leader in 2008. He was re-elected in 2012, defeating his Republican challenger Mitt Romney.

The USA is home to some of the world’s most iconic structures, from the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, to the Hollywood sign, the Jefferson Memorial and Mount Rushmore.

Belgium, however, adopt a rather more tongue-in-cheek approach. In Brussels, there is an almost 400-year-old water feature called Manneken Pis, where a bronze statue of a little boy is seen urinating into a basin.

They do have a rather serous heritage, though, with Brussels considered as the de facto capital of the European Union. ‘The Commuist Manifesto’ by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels was also written in Brussels, becoming one of the planet’s defining political manuscripts.

WINNER: USA

Amerian’s have Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny, the Belgians have Tintin, with cartoonist Georges Remi’s comic strips becoming among the most iconic in Europe in the 20th century, translated into seventy languages from the original French.

Signed off with his pen-name Herge, Remi recounted the tale of a young reporter Tintin, who was nobly aided by his white wire fox terrier Snowy. For all Tintin’s exploits, though, the Belgians may need a little more to compete with the global domination of Walt Disney and his instantly recognisable productions.

WINNER: USA

FINAL SCORE: USA 3 BELGIUM 2...

...BUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE REAL MATCH?The Belgium squad is jam-packed with familiar faces, with twelve Premier League stars on show, including Chelsea’s Eden Hazard, Manchester City’s Vincent Kompany and Manchester United pair Adnan Januzaj and Marouane Fellaini. It is hailed as a golden 
generation littered with attacking flair, as a host of young stars 
emerge onto the global stage.

The USA squad may be less familiar to the Eurpean audience, with only four Premier League players: 
Geoff Cameron of Stoke City, Jozy Altidore of Sunderland and the two 
goalkeepers, Brad Guzan of Aston Villa and Tim Howard of Everton.

Only
 one member of the US squad played Champions League football last 
season, as Bayern Munich youngster Julian Green made an injury-time 
cameo appearance in the group stage back in November.

Only three Begium players are based in their national league, compared to the nine US players that ply 
their trade in the MLS, as Jurgen Klinsmann’s side battle against all 
expectations to reach the final eight of the World Cup in Brazil.

The Belgian team head into the game with a 100 per cent record in Brazil, after defeating Algeria, Russia and South Korea in their three group games, keeping two clean sheets in the process. They will, however, be hoping that their attacking players now join the party, with Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard still to score, with Belgium scoring just four goals in three games.

The USA, meanwhile, captured the hearts of the global audience with a spirited showing to draw 2-2 with Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal and a victory over Ghana was enough to ensure America’s progress into the knockout stages of the competition. Kyle Beckerman has emerged as a serious force in the central midfield, while Tim Howard and Jermaine Jones have attracted the headlines with show-stopping moments.
