Gary Ballance, perhaps wisely, chose a low-key way to celebrate his third century in only his sixth Test in what became his first win with England.

‘I stayed in with a DVD,’ he said about victory in Southampton. ‘It was suggested to us that it might not be the best idea to go out.’

It is not difficult to see why. The last time Ballance, 24, did that, after the drawn first Test in Nottingham, he ended up shirtless and the worse for wear in the Pandora’s Box nightclub, shouting ‘England, England,’ as he was helped out.

Lesson learnt: Gary Ballance is letting his cricket do the talking after his embarrassing night out

One too many! Here is how the Daily Mail reported Gary Ballance's night of shame

The resulting ticking off and acute embarrassment for a young batsman making his way in the England team was a severe test of his character.

But it is one he responded to, scoring two centuries in the two Tests since in what is becoming one of the great introductions to the ultimate form of the game.

‘On that first morning at Lord’s I was a bit nervous and embarrassed,’ he admitted. ‘I was under pressure after what happened but that may have been good for me because I put in a performance and proved a few people wrong.’

It should be pointed out that the players had been given permission to go out after the Trent Bridge Test and Ballance did not break any team rules, was not out excessively late and did not behave badly to any members of the public.

Yet it was not a good look for an elite sportsman four days before the next Test, not least because England were in the middle of such a dismal run and had very little at that stage to celebrate. Ballance insists he has learnt his lesson.

‘I have joked that I had bowled a maiden at Trent Bridge and wanted to celebrate,’ said Ballance. ‘But the timing of it coming out made me feel as if I’d let the team down the night before Lord’s. It’s not what you want from yourself.

‘We had been told we could go out and I like to let my hair down a bit at the right times but not in a stupid way. I probably had one too many. And I can’t ever remember taking my shirt off before. I was nervous about what my parents would think but they were very understanding. I think they have even framed one of the pictures of me!’

That night, when pictures that at least confirmed Ballance has worked on his body shape and fitness emerged, England captain Alastair Cook decided to take the Zimbabwe-born player for a meal to make sure his mind was on the next day’s job.

‘I wasn’t told off as such,’ said Ballance after being reminded of his responsibilities. ‘It was more a slap on the wrist and I was told not to do it again. Then Cooky took me out for some food with Joe Root and Matt Prior and told me that it can happen and I would be laughing about it in a few days. He also said these things are quickly forgotten, but I’m not sure that’s the case just yet.’

At least his form and England’s Investec series-levelling win at the Ageas Bowl have turned more attention on Ballance’s batting than his drinking. He is not an eye-catching performer, but he is proving mightily effective in Jonathan Trott’s old position of No 3.

Three hundreds, two further half centuries and 628 runs in total at an average of 62.80 is some going for this adopted Yorkshireman, especially in a team which before Southampton had been struggling so much. ‘I couldn’t have asked for a better start and I really didn’t expect it to go like this,’ admitted Ballance, who was asked to bat at three at the behest of Peter Moores before the series against Sri Lanka.

‘When the coaches back you to bat there it’s a massive boost because Trotty has done an unbelievable job there, scoring runs for fun, and they were big shoes to fill.

Stats amazing! The Yorkshireman has hit three centuries in his fledgling Test career, with a run average of 62.8

‘I feel I’m batting up there with the best I’ve ever done,’ said Ballance, who was originally approached to join Yorkshire by Geoff Boycott after he had spent two years at Derbyshire when he first came to England. ‘I had a decent start to the county season and I’m delighted to have brought my form to Test cricket.’

And now he has his first Test victory, along with five other members of England’s third Test team, a landmark he celebrated by grabbing a stump as he ran from the Ageas Bowl when India were defeated. ‘The lads gave me some stick for that,’ he said. ‘Jimmy Anderson was man of the match and he didn’t get one. But I’ve still got that stump. Winning is a great feeling after such a tough time.’
