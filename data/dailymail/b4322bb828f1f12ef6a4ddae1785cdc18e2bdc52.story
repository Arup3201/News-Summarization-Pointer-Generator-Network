Uber has unveiled a new delivery service where its drivers will deliver goods from a local corner store.

The firm is trialling the 'Uber Corner Store' in Washington.

It boasts the service will 'bring the neighbourhood shop to your doorstep.

A limited set of Uber users will be able to order convenience store goods - such as 'allergy medicine, diapers, toothpaste and over 100 other items' via Uber's app.

customers will be able to order goods such as 'allergy medicine, diapers, toothpaste and over 100 other items' via Uber's app.

The Uber service is currently only available in Washington DC.

According to Uber, the experiment is 'limited-time-only' and 'will run for a few weeks.' But, Uber hints, 'the more you love it, the more likely it will last.'

The service works through the firm's car app.

'If a driver is available, we’ll shoot you a text message with a link to the items available for purchase,' the firm said.

Drivers then call the customer to get their order, which is billed to their Uber account.

'Because Corner Store is an experiment, we’re rolling it out to a limited number of Uber DC riders in select areas,' the firm said.

The experiment mirrors numerous competing product on-demand delivery services, including Postmates and Seamless, the food delivery firm.

Uber's service will handle deliveries by car, unlike the competition, which largely relies on bike messengers.

Uber has also launches a bike messenger service in New York.

This may explain why Uber is testing the service in Washington D.C., and not in over-saturated markets like San Francisco and New York.

'Starting August 19th, Corner Store will be available Monday – Friday, 9am – 9pm EDT, to a select number of Uber DC riders within a limited area,' the controversial car firm said.

'We’re working to build supply, and will be sure to update you as we extend hours of operation to cover late night and weekend requests!'
