If you struggle to squeeze in daily chores and make time to entertain your friends, life could be about to get much easier.

This because the home of the future will be stuffed with time-saving gadgets such as wardrobes that clean your clothes and robotic vacuum cleaners that keep you safe, enabling families to spend more time together and less time doing menial tasks.

While mood-changing wallpaper and ‘cyber mirrors’ may sound like they belong in a sci-fi film, such technology has been developed and could be in your home in a matter of years.

An infographic created by furniture retailer trueinterior.com shows the array of gadgets we may have to get to grips with in the next few years. 

We could be sleeping on magnetic smart beds that float in mid-air and there would be no need to change the sheets regularly, because it would include self-sterilisation technology to blitz bacteria.

London-based design scientist and futurist Melissa Sterry designed a conceptual bed whose sheets can respond to changes in a sleeper's temperature and could also beam a holographic companion to soothe them to sleep.

No more washing clothes? The LG Styler wardrobe (pictured) is fitted with LG's Clothes Care System, designed to refresh clothes without water or detergents using its TrueSteam technology. This consists of hot steam spray technology, which LG uses in washers and dryers, and is said to get rid of 99.9 per cent of the germs and bacteria

The design is based on the results of a study carried out by The Sleep Council, which found that 47 per cent of people would like clean, bacteria-proof sheets.

Homeowners will also hang their clothes in a wardrobe, which will clean clothes stored in it, meaning no more separating whites and colours and laboriously hanging clothes up.

This technology is already here and was shown off at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week.

Made by LG, the wardrobe is fitted with the South Korean firm’s Clothes Care System, designed to refresh clothes without water or detergents using its TrueSteam technology.

By way of bedroom entertainment, screens placed above the bed could let dreamers gaze at stars and systems could monitor their health while they sleep.

Interactive holograms of parents could be used in children’s' rooms so they are always around to read a bedtime story, for example, while smart windows in bedrooms mean that homeowners could wake up to any view they like every morning. 

In the house of the future, there will be no need to wait an eternity to get a hot shower or bath, and you could keep up to date with the news while brushing your teeth.

A futuristic 'Arc' shower could recycle warm water, while the pressure and temperature would be controlled using a touchscreen on the arc-shaped appliance.

Similarly, smart baths will allow workers to run a bath on their way home via a smartphone app. A warming feature will ensure the water never goes cold and a self-clean function means that the days of back-breaking scrubbing will soon be over.

Bathroom mirrors may replaced with cyber equivalents that double as TVs and show the news and social media feeds as people brush their teeth. 

Life is about to get easier for struggling cooks, because the Inspiro Oven uses sensors to work out what will be cooked and set the temperature and time required to cook a dish perfectly.

Electrolux’s oven has unconventional settings so users can choose a category, such as 'roast' and then set whether they want their meat rate, medium or well done, instead of working out the time and setting the temperature.

This consists of hot steam spray technology, which LG uses in washers and dryers, and is said to get rid of 99.9 per cent of the germs and bacteria. 

Tests carried out by Intertek found the LG Styler also eliminates approximately 92 per cent of Perchloroethylene - a chemical left on clothes after dry cleaning.

A Quick Refresh button keeps clothes smelling fresh, while Moving Hanger Action gently shakes steamed items to remove everyday wrinkles.

There is also an Easy Pants Crease Care feature, which refreshes and irons trousers with a ‘perfect crease’ in half an hour.

The LG Styler additionally features a built-in heat pump.

This generates and maintains warm air at a low temperature to keep clothing from shrinking or being damaged while drying.

Plus, the Odor Removal feature uses steam to help remove smells left behind by smoke, food and sweat, and depending on individual tastes, users can choose between two different aroma sheets.

In homes of the future, people will unroll their TVs and possibly control them by blinking. LG has already unveiled a roll-up 18 inch Ultra HD TV, which uses a special film instead of plastic as backing to allow it to be turned into a scroll.The flexible OLED panel has a high-definition class resolution of 1200 X 810 with almost 1 million mega-pixels and can be rolled up to a radius of 3cm without affecting the function of the display

A water-free dishwashing cupboard, which currently a concept, would not only save space in the kitchen, but put an end to the tedium of washing up as well as unloading a conventional dishwasher. It would use carbon monoxide to remove traces of food and grime from plates and cutlery.

An energy-saving fridge filled with gel could be used to preserve food. Russian designer Yuriy Dmitriev came up with the idea for the Bio Robot Refrigerator.

His concept suggests that shoppers could simply place their sealed groceries into the cavern of odourless and non-sticky gel to keep it cool without even having to open a door.

And they could make coffee and other drinks remotely, using a smartphone, while robotic bar tenders, which have already been invented, could prove a hi-tech alternative. 

A Wi-Fi Coffee Machine by British firm Smarter will go on sale in March for £129 and will make coffee from scratch, grinding the beans and boiling water using set recipes that can be tweaked to suit the owner’s taste.

The machine can be controlled by an app and work with a range of other devices, such as smartbands and watches too.

The Wi-Fi Coffee Machine by Smarter (left) can be triggered, via a smartphone, to not only make you a hot drink tailored to your individual taste but have it ready for you before you even wake up. As well as smart drinks machines, homes of the future may have fridges full of gel to keep food cool and fresh. A conceptual image is shown right

With no need to vacuum thanks to robotic vacuum cleaners, which are already on the market, homeowners will have more time to spend with their families and friends.

A dining pod could take the headache out of dinner parties, because it unfurls like a flower complete with mood lighting for an evening, before folding away the next day.

Afterwards, a tired host could relax on a magnetic floating sofa and watch a roll-up TV by changing channel at the flick of an eyelid.

LG unveiled a roll-up 18 inch Ultra HD TV in July, which uses a special film instead of plastic as backing to allow it to be turned into a scroll.

The flexible OLED panel has a high-definition class resolution of 1200 X 810 with almost 1 million mega-pixels and can be rolled up to a radius of 3cm without affecting the function of the display.

Meanwhile, a Chinese brand called Haier has built a TV controlled by a person's eyes.

The prototype uses an eye tracking unit so a user can control an on-screen cursor just by looking at it and blink to select an option.

Wallpaper will also change colour and pattern to suit a person’s mood. 

With so many smart devices that are connected to the internet in the home of the future, owners will need a gadget to control them easily.

The company behind a 'smart home automation system' called NEEO is seeking investment on Kickstarter for its technology, claiming that it's 'the simplest way to connect and control all devices in your home'.

A Californian company has created the Neeo remote control (pictured) that can be used to control smart appliances in the home, with the help of a 'brain' unit. The remote will recognise a user's hand when they pick it up to select the correct profile and display favourites and playlists for audio gadgets, for example

It comprises a cylindrical 'brain' that communicates with various smart appliances, and a remote control, enabling a home owner to control them.

The brain will have a database of more than 30,000 devices that it could connect to and control, including support for Apple TV, Roku and Philips Hue lights, as well as being able to work with all major AV products produced in the last 10 years.

The rechargeable aluminium remote will recognise a user's hand when they pick it up to select the correct profile and display favourites and  playlists for audio gadgets, for example.

Homeowners will also be able to use an app, if they are not nearby the remote control. The two gadgets together are available to pre-order for $199 on Kickstarter.
