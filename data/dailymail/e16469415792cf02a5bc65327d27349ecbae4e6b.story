They are one of nature's most magnificent predators, and these stunning pictures show how they can jump up to eight feet in the air.

The 15-foot-long great white shark completes the jump in a quest for food.

Eating two cape fur seals whole, as well as biting down on special decoys used to encourage sharks to leap, these hungry sharks are a powerful reminder of nature at its most fearsome.

Dutch photographer Peter Verhoog, 58, explained what it was like to witness these deadly hunters at False Bay, South Africa.

'The sight of a great white hunting is unbelievable,' he said.

'The immense power is incredible, and makes you feel humble.

'During the hunt the shark swims just above the sea floor, following the group of seals at speed.

In many cases, they do not catch the seal, that frantically starts moving around, trying to escape the powerful jaws

'When they have chosen their prey, mostly a slower or younger individual, they change their direction from horizontal to vertical, and swim straight up, so fast that they 'jump' out of the water.

'In many cases, they do not catch the seal, that frantically starts moving around, trying to escape the powerful jaws.

'If they do bite the seal, they leave it for a while, because a dying seal can wound the shark with its teeth and claws.'

While great white sharks have a fearsome reputation they are in fact a vulnerable species of marine fish more in danger from humans than any other creature.

Peter explained why great white sharks are important to the ocean ecosystem.

'Great white sharks are the most powerful sharks, and play an essential role in the health of our oceans,' he said.

'They keep the stocks of seals limited, and therefore protect fish stocks.

'Every day, the seals have to travel to their fishing grounds, sometimes as far as 30 miles.

'The sharks know this, and keep watch.'

Although fearsome, sharks are among the most endangered marine life out there
