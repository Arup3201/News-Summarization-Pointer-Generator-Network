Extremist Islamists may well have wondered how they could possibly celebrate the happiest day of their lives - their wedding - while at the same time re-affirming their commitment to violent jihad.

Or they may not have. In any case, the gap in the market has now been filled by the Islamic State, which is offering honeymoon bus tours across its self-declared caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria.

The move into tourism comes after the group, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, opened a marriage bureau for women who want to meet the jihadi of their dreams.

We're all going on a Sunni holiday: An Islamic State fighter waves the group's flag during a parade in Raqqa province, Syria. Islamic State have begun running bus tours for civilians who want to visit the new caliphate

The matchmaking service is operating from Al-Bab, in Syria's Aleppo province, for 'single women and widows who would like to marry IS fighters,' said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

According to the monitoring group, run out of Coventry, UK, residents report that women were invited to leave their details 'and IS fighters will coming knocking at the door and officially ask for marriage'.

Newlywed couples can then join other civilians on Islamic State's bus tours around the various parts of the newly declared Muslim theocracy.

Running twice a week from Raqa in Syria to Anbar, Iraq, IS buses fly the group's distinctive black flag and play jihadist songs throughout the journey, reports AFP.

It is not known whether tourists are invited to sing along. Illicit holiday romances are unlikely to be tolerated: the group advocates public stoning for adultery.

Some of the region's most-famous attractions, particularly the famous and ancient Shi'ite shrines, will also not be available to see, having been blown up in bomb attacks by Islamic State fighters.

Islamic State now controls massive swathes of northern and eastern Syria, the Iraq-Syria border, and parts of northern and western Iraq.

It has been accused of a range of atrocities, including mass kidnappings and killings, stonings and executions.

Are you ready ladies? Islamic State has also opened a marriage bureau 'for single women and widows who would like to marry IS fighters,' according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights

Interested women are invited to leave their details with the matchmaking service in Al-Bab, in Syria's Aleppo province, 'and IS fighters will coming knocking at the door and officially ask for marriage'

Islamic State has its roots in Iraq, but spread into Syria in late spring 2013.

In June, IS fighters spearheaded a lightning offensive in Iraq that saw large swathes of the country fall from Iraqi government hands.

Rebel groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime since March 2011 accuse IS, which has attracted thousands of foreign jihadists, of having 'hijacked' their uprising.
