Deciding what to wear for a day at the races ought to be fun. But for Pippa Middleton, it seems it's strictly a matter of business.

Because four hours before she arrived at the Cheltenham Festival, we all knew exactly what her outfit would be – courtesy of a helpful press release from the company which supplied it.

Designer Katherine Hooker issued the missive to announce that the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister would be attending the races in one of her bespoke £815 coats.

Horsing around: Pippa Middleton with her friend, banker Tom Kingston

Keeping good company: Pippa spent the day at Cheltenham with her banker 
friend Tom Kingston, who has been her companion for various engagements 
in the past

Close: The two have been firm friends for a while and at one time were rumoured to have been dating

She also tweeted: 'The sun is shining at Cheltenham and how GREAT does Pippa Middleton look in her Katherine Hooker Tori coat?'

And if that wasn't enough to guarantee plenty of photographs, the coat itself was in a particularly bright shade of yellow.

It meant all eyes – and cameras – were on Miss Middleton when she arrived at 1pm.

The 29-year-old completed her outfit 
with a Cossack hat, chocolate brown suede knee-high boots, £140 Givenchy
sunglasses and a patent leather clutch bag.

When asked whether Miss Middleton had
been given the coat – which is not available to buy until September – 
as a gift, the fashion house was uncharacteristically coy.

A spokesman for the Chelsea-based firm said: 'I'm afraid we don't discuss our customers at all.'

Eligible: A friend of Pippa's recently told the Daily Mail's Richard Kay, 'Tom is utterly charming, polite and very popular with the ladies. In fact, he is just the kind of guy you would want to introduce to your mother'

Getting along: Pippa and Tom, a Bristol graduate, are said to have met through mutual friends

Royal connections: The two watch the Queen Mother Champion Steeple Chase

Retro: Pippa's brown and yellow outfit had a Seventies vibe, and she joined the majority of Cheltenham's ladies by wearing a fur hat for the occasion

And it is not known whether Miss Middleton approved the press release issued by the firm, which has a stall at Cheltenham.

As the day went on, the designer was 
keen to capitalise on the attention Miss Middleton was receiving, urging
fans on Twitter to pre-order the coat.

Katherine Hooker is a favourite 
of the Duchess of Cambridge, who wore two of her jackets on consecutive 
days when she attended Cheltenham with Prince William in 2007.

Earlier this week, the designer told a
newspaper: '[The Duchess of Cambridge] doesn't take free clothes, and 
I've heard that from other people who sent her things.

'She always comes to the shop, which is nice. She's just an incredibly lovely person.'

Just as eye-catching as the coat was 
Miss Middleton's male companion. She is dating stockbroker Nico Jackson,
35, but attended Cheltenham with eligible banker Tom Kingston.

She and Mr Kingston, 34, roared with 
laughter as they watched the horses they were apparently backing lose in
the third race. Miss Middleton covered her face with her hands and 
grinned, pointing to the last runners in the race and throwing her hands
up in despair.

The pair have attended several 
sporting events together, and Miss Middleton is understood to be just 
good friends with the handsome Bristol graduate.

Yesterday they positioned themselves 
at the front of their private box, which had been hired by a law firm. 
The area was heavily guarded by police and security.

Punter Mark Connolly tweeted: 'Pippa Middleton just walked past … Never seen as many police around one person.'

Zara Phillips and her husband Mike 
Tindall also attended, but watched from a separate hospitality area 
along with Tindall's rugby team-mates.

Pippa's coat is a Katherine Hooker's Tori coat, made bespoke for her in mustard yellow.

The custom-made versions sell for £815 on the company's website.

The British label, which has its headquarters in the upmarket London borough of Chelsea, has a stand at the race event this week where they are taking orders for their luxury outerwear.
