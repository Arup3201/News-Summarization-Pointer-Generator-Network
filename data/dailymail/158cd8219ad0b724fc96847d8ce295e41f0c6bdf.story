A prestigious boys high school in Sydney is at the centre of serious allegations of indecent assault made by a group of boarding students.

Police are investigating the incident at The King's School in Parramatta where it has been alleged that unwanted sexual contact occurred including the act of 'turkey slapping', where a male student is said to have rubbed his genitals on another boy's face. 

Police confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that detectives from the Child Abuse Squad are investigating allegations of indecent and physical assault at a school in Sydney's north-west.

'The allegations relate to students assaulting other students,' the statement said. 

'Given those alleged to be involved are juveniles it would be inappropriate for police to provide any further detail at this  time.'

The private boarding school's headmaster, Dr Tim Hawkes, confirmed that police were investigating the allegations made by students.

'The school has been made aware of an allegation and is cooperating with the police over the matter,' Dr Hawkes told the Daily Telegraph. 

Police conducted a search of the school’s administration building two Fridays ago.

Some of the alleged incidents, which began as practical jokes, were allegedly filmed and uploaded to social media websites, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The King's School is Australia's oldest independent school and offers education to boys from Pre-Kindergarten age to Year 12.
