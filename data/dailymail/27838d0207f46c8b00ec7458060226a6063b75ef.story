Tribute act: James Crockett performed on stage in Tenerife while claiming benefits in the UK

A Robbie Williams tribute act who admitted claiming £8,500 in incapacity benefit while performing the singer's greatest hits in Tenerife has walked free from court.

James Crockett claimed he was too ill to work, but was able to travel to the Canary Islands to perform chart-topping hits by the former Take That singer and Michael Bublé.

Crockett, whose stage name is Andy James, pleaded guilty to failing to tell the Department for Work and Pensions that he was no longer unable to work for most of 2012.   

The 43-year-old, whose website claims he is the 'only choice' when it comes to Robbie Williams impersonators, illegally claimed £8,463 over the course of the year.

His separate Bublé tribute act webpage claims he 'delivers Bublés [sic] greatest hits with the same flamboyance and panache as the man himself'. 

Crockett was spared jail following a hearing at Bradford Crown Court - despite the judge previously acknowledging that the public was 'outraged' by benefits cheats.

Judge Durham Hall told Crockett: 'All the while you were strutting your stuff on various stages in this country and abroad.

'Clearly your breach was particularly deliberate and wilful and the public are fed up and outraged when they pay their taxes, if they are lucky enough to have a job at all, and then see somebody living to some extent an interesting, if not high, life and pocketing £8,500.'

The judge said he had intended to send Crockett to prison, but having considered the current sentencing guidelines a short jail term of about two months would be derisory.

Crockett, of Skipton, West Yorkshire, who has no previous convictions, underwent surgery for a serious back problem in 2002 and was nearly paralysed.

The court previously heard that he had suffered medical difficulties for a number of years, including a stroke, and was advised by his GP to move somewhere warm because of problems with his back.

Claims: Crockett, pictured performing as Robbie Williams, initially said he was ignorant of the benefit system

Prosecutor Emma Downing said that when he was initially questioned about his offending he denied being dishonest and said he was ignorant of the benefit system.

But the court heard that Crockett had eventually pleaded guilty to the charge. He is now voluntarily repaying the £8,463 he fraudulently claimed at the rate of £40 per month. 

Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC had warned Crocket at a hearing last month that he could be jailed for the offending, but today decided to impose a 12-month community order which includes 150 hours unpaid work and a three-month home curfew between 7pm and 7am. Crockett will also have to pay costs of £200.

Walked free: Crockett, who also performed as Michael Bublie was spared jail today following a hearing

Barrister Charlotte Worsley, for Crockett, stressed that his benefit claim had not been fraudulent from the outset and he had now learned his lesson. 

'He is a man who has had some real health difficulties over the years,' said Miss Worsley.

She submitted that the offending was nearly three years ago now and added: 'He is ashamed and embarrassed that he is before the courts today.'
