Crime victims face having to report offences online then track the progress of investigations ‘like a parcel’ under plans by Britain’s second biggest police force to marginalise bobbies on the beat.

Theft, assault and criminal damage victims are among those who will be expected to upload their own evidence in the ‘self-service’ reporting system, instead of liaising with an officer face-to-face or by phone.

As well as supplying pictures of stolen phones or cars, victims will be asked to file crime reports to the web-based portal in plans that will also see the loss of 2,500 staff.

The ‘virtual policing’ plans, unveiled in a five-year blueprint by West Midlands Police, were condemned by crime victims. Tariq Jahan, whose son Haroon, 20, was one of three men killed protecting homes in the 2011 summer riots in Birmingham, said the plans ‘didn’t inspire confidence’.

Mr Jahan, from West Bromwich, said: ‘For a victim of crime, one-to-one interaction with a human is important.’ He added that many elderly people would have difficulties with the new system.

Birmingham lawyer Dean Parnell, who had to track down and recover his stolen iPad in 2013 because officers were too busy to attend, said ‘a faceless online service... could lead to important evidence being missed’.

The force also wants to encourage witnesses to supply images or video footage of incidents such as street thefts or assaults.

Its new operating model will see neighbourhood officers deployed into specific areas, instead of across the force patch, leaving middle class areas where crime is less of an issue without a significant uniform presence.

The force said the changes were needed as part of cuts aimed at saving £130million over the next four years. Chief Constable Chris Sims admitted that officers would ‘not be as visible on the streets’ in future, as the force looked to achieve ‘greater efficiency’.

Beat bobbies will be cut or reassigned, with the ten neighbourhood policing units replaced by smaller teams targeting areas where a police presence is most needed. The plans will see the Birmingham-based constabulary shrink to its smallest size since it was established in 1974.

The force wants to encourage online reporting of all but the most serious offences. David Jamieson, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, said: ‘We hope that by the end of this year you will be able to log in and watch the progress of an investigation in the same way that you can track a parcel.’
