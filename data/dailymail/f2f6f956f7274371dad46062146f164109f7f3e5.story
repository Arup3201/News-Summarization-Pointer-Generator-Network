Anyone who’s travelled on London’s Northern Line will know that it’s often cramped – and very hot.

But now engineers have found an ingenious use for the excess subterranean heat that it generates.

It’ll be captured and used to warm-up over 500 homes in the Islington area of the capital.

Hot stuff: Engineers will be putting excess heat generated on the often cramped Northern Line to good use by piping it into hundreds of homes

The heat will be piped from a Northern Line vent into Islington Council’s innovative Bunhill Heat and Power heat network, which already supplies more than 700 homes in Islington with greener heating.

The network has 1.4 miles of pipes which carry the heat to local housing estates and a leisure centre. Heat from the London Underground will be captured and added to this network.

The heat network is currently fed by a Combined Heat and Power energy centre which produces both electricity and heat. In the same way that we use heat from a car engine to keep us warm when driving, the energy centre uses the heat created from producing electricity to help heat buildings and provide hot water.

A Mayor of London source said the scheme will reduce their heating bills by 10 per cent.

The Underground project - the first of its kind in Europe - is a partnership between Islington Council, the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, UK Power Networks and Transport for London.

Mr Johnson hopes it will help him achieve his pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent and produce 25 per cent of London’s energy from local sources by by 2025.

Matthew Pencharz, the Mayor of London’s Senior Advisor on Environment and Energy, said: ‘We need to do everything possible to create a more secure, cost-effective and sustainable heat and power supply for London.

‘By supporting locally sourced energy and heat networks which can reduce bills and lower carbon emissions, we can not only save money but also drive innovation, jobs and growth in this burgeoning sector.’

Cllr Richard Watts, Leader of the Council, said: ‘The expanded Bunhill Heat Network will cut energy bills for hundreds more local people. With energy prices going up and up, it's vital we do what we can to cut bills.

‘It's all part of the Council's work to help people manage the rising cost of living. Last winter was one of the coldest for decades and record energy prices meant many families on fixed incomes spent it in misery, unsure whether to heat or eat.’

Martin Wilcox, head of future networks at UK Power Networks, said: ‘We are carrying out a feasibility project exploring the potential to capture waste heat from one of our high voltage electricity substations and use it to warm local homes for the first time.

‘If it is successful there could be potential to replicate this and increase access to low carbon, low cost energy in other parts of the capital because we have electricity substations dotted throughout London which keep the lights on for millions of homes and businesses.’
