No Hollywood wedding would be complete without an extreme pre-nup in case of an unhappy ending.

But while most pre-wedding contracts are drawn up to protect spouses in cases of wandering hands or financial misdemeanours, controlling Kanye West is said to have demanded a clause banning his wife-to-be from having any more surgery.

According to reports in this week's Heat magazine the musician, whose mother died on the operating table, hit the roof when he saw messages between Kim and her surgeons discussing her next bout of body maintenance. And so the 36-yr-old demanded Kim refrain from 'lipo, botox, another nose job.'

This will be a bitter pill to swallow for the 33-year-old reality star who has seemingly spent years perfecting her face. Fortunately one of the ways that Kim maintains her youthful looks doesn't have anything to do with a doctor's scalpel.

Since she first hit the headlines in 2006 Kim's face has changed dramatically and her rising hairline has been the source of constant speculation.

While some have hinted at a full hairline lift, a painful and expensive procedure that can leave scarring, most experts agree that Kim has used laser surgery on her forehead to remove hair and give her a new hairline.

Surgeon Asim Shahmalak, hair loss expert on Channel 4 medical show Embarrassing Bodies, said that Kim Kardashian has almost certainly had the 'baby hair' from the front of her hairline removed.

He said this can be done temporarily by waxing or more permanently through laser removal.

Dr Shahmalak, from the Crown Clinic hair transplant centre in Manchester, agreed: 'It is very likely that Kim Kardashian has had the baby hairs around hairline removed.

'This can be done by waxing - a similar procedure to how women remove hair from their legs or bikini line.

'But it is more likely that Kim has opted for laser surgery, a more permanent form of removal.'

Dr Shahmalak, Britain's leading hair transplant surgeon specialises in female hair treatments and is the first surgeon in the UK to perform an EYELASH transplant.

He added that around 10% of women have facial hair removal - most commonly on the upper lip and chin.

But hair removal around the hairline as may have happened to Kim is much rarer.

He said the procedure was still fairly uncommon but publicity around celebrities was sure to increase demand because many women would have been previously unaware that there was a solution to the problem.

He explained: 'This kind of procedure around the hairline is much less common. Obviously some women - particularly celebrities - are very sensitive about their appearances and may feel hair growth in this area is a little unfeminine.'

The baby hair can be removed permanently in around four to six laser surgery sessions lasting around 30 minutes to an hour each time. Prices start at around £50 a session in the UK, though treatments at top clinics in Los Angeles are considerably more expensive.

Dr Shahmalak said: 'It is relatively straight-forward procedure that can be done in the lunch-hour with very quick recovery time.

'Laser treatment will remove hair permanently in four to six sessions - the key is to catch the hair follicle throughout all of its growth cycles.

'It is fairly painless, as pulses of light from the laser of a pre-determined wavelength pass down the hair follicle and kill it at the root, preventing re-growth, without any sort of damage to the rest of the body. It is a proven, extremely popular treatment, that can remove unwanted hair permanently from anywhere on the body.

'The procedure is carried out by a fully qualified esthetician. The laser works specifically to attack hair by travelling through the pigment in the hair, down to the root, where the energy is absorbed by the bulb. During this process the follicle gets killed and stops producing hair.

'Due to the way the body works and produces hair, you will typically need more than one session per course of treatments as the hair grows in cycles, so you cannot 'catch' and disable all follicle in one treatment. You will find that following each session, you will be able to go about your daily business as per usual, without any negative laser hair removal side effects.

'The discomfort during a laser hair removal treatment is minimal. Laser hair removal patients can opt to use soothing cream to minimize discomfort in the most sensitive areas. Most patients say it is far less painful than waxing.'

The 'no-surgery' pre-nup clause will see Kim suffer a financial penalty of around $500,000 if the couple divorce.

As well as banning Kim from having surgery musician Kanye is also insisting that the mother of his child stop her mother Kris Jenner from interfering with their private and professional lives.

Sustained Botox use gives the appearance of an elongated forehead

Anne-Marie Gillett, Non-Surgical Director at Transform Cosmetic Surgery* believes that Kim's love of Botox may also have had an effect on her hairline. She says: 'Looking at the images of Kim Kardashian, it appears to me that her shiny, line-free, elongated forehead is showing classic telltale signs of recent and long term Botox use.

'Kim is in danger of looking over done, with her skin beginning to look too taut and shiny. Regular use of Botox, with what appears to also be work on the eyebrows, and the tidying up of her hair, gives the appearance of a higher hairline.

'Many celebrities are keen Botox users and many also have this shiny, elongated look. A good example is Nicole Kidman.

'It’s unusual for either men or women to request to have their hairline higher, in fact, it’s quite the opposite – many people look to reduce the appearance of a large forehead or hair recession.

'Kim undoubtedly looks great and is loved by many women wanting to look good and stop the signs of ageing. A combination of Botox, dermal fillers in the cheek area, regular non-surgical treatments and fantastic contouring by her make-up artist has resulted in this smooth appearance.

'We would always recommend that less is more. Once you’ve reached the stage where you’ve achieved the appearance you want, you should leave more time between treatments, and also minimise the amount of product you are having injected. You should always seek the advice of a qualified aesthetician or doctor, so that you can achieve a natural look without looking overdone and unnatural.'
