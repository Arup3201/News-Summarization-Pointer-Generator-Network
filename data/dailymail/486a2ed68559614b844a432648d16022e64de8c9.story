Christmas has come early for those hoping to get a good look at the latest BlackBerry, as new images fresh off the rumor mill are believed to show the latest mobile device.

If genuine, the photos give a close-up look at a previously unseen model complete with BlackBerry's classic keyboard design.

The images show a straight keyboard similar to the one seen on the Torch model.

Back with a vengeance? If genuine, the photos give a close-up look at a previously unseen model complete with BlackBerry's classic keyboard design

Other specifications of the handset are not yet known.

Manufacturer Research in Motion is still more than a month away from unveiling the next generation of the BlackBerry.

The photos were first revealed by CrackBerry.com, via Chinese site CNBeta.

The site reports that the latest image shows the BlackBerry 10 N-Series, which is rumored to debut with a touchscreen L-Series phone next month.

What still remains a mystery is the 
device's operating system, which cannot be seen because the phone is 
turned off in all the leaked image.

A purported photo of the L-Series phone was revealed earlier this month by a Vietnamese tech site.

The photo showed a gadget that's sleek, shiny and futuristic - and that looks suspiciously like an iPhone.

Those images suggested that Research in Motion (RIM) was finally giving up the full keyboard that was the brand's virtual trademark in favor of a full touchscreen device to compete with Apple and Google devices.

But unlike the iPhone, the new 
BlackBerry has no home button adorning its front. It is expected that 
the software will allow users to switch between apps without having to 
go via a home screen.

Pictures
 of the side of the device shows it boasts not only a micro-USB 
connector, but also a slot for a micro-HDMI cable, which could enable it
 to connect to high resolution external displays.

Expert Reviews
 says this suggests that RIM could be planning to bundle the phone with 
film rental services, which Apple and Google already do with their 
operating systems.

Other shots of the phone revealed that it
 is textured for grip, and, unlike some new smartphones like Motorola's 
latest Android-based Razr, it has a removable cover.

Best pictures yet: The images are similar to the handset shown in previous leaks, but are far clearer than those previously seen, many of which were blurry

Slimline: The device boasts not only a micro-USB connector, but also a slot for a micro-HDMI cable, which could enable it to connect to high resolution external displays

A peek inside the phone shows slots for a micro-SIM and microSD memory card, along with a removable 1,800mAh battery.

The touch screen images were first leaked by Vietnamese site Tinhte.vn, which said the phone feels 'very comfortable' to hold, but refuses to go into details of how they got a hold of the device.

The next generation of BlackBerry 
devices is likely to be a 'make it or break it' moment for RIM, which 
has gone from being the executive smartphone of choice to an also ran in
 the mobile market.

Last 
month one analyst warned investors to ditch their shares in the Canadian
 firm, predicting that the BlackBerry 10 OS will be 'dead on arrival' 
when it finally launches in 2013.

Bloomberg
 quoted James Faucette of Pacific Crest Securities as telling investors:
 'We expect the new OS to be met with a lukewarm response at best and 
ultimately likely to fail.'

The company has said it will release its next generation of smartphones on January 30.
