A British man living in New Jersey reported missing almost two months ago turned up only to be arrested and go missing again.

Roger Temple, 44, was missing for seven weeks before being arrested Sunday in Manhattan for petty shoplifting. Upon being released he promptly went back off-the-grid.

Temple was busted Sunday night for stealing peanuts from a Washington Heights bodega, according to reports.

Have you seen this man?: Richard Temple has been missing for almost two months

The missing man was last seen at his home June 19, his last contact was a June 20 text message to his girlfriend, according to the Bernardsville News. His whereabouts were unknown until he was snagged by police for trying to five-finger discount a $2 bag of peanuts, NJ.com said.

‘He got picked up, fingerprinted and processed for this minor shoplifting charge,’ Bedminster Police Chief Patrick Ussery told the site.

The arresting officer did not run Temple’s details through the National Crime Information Center, would have flagged him as missing, the News reported.

‘Unfortunately, at the time of processing they didn't run him through NCIC or didn't get a result which would have given us immediate notification,’ Ussery told NJ.com.

It wasn’t until after Temple was released back into the wild that his prints were put into NCIC and flagged, prompting Somerset County (NJ) dispatch to notify Bedminster Police of the arrest, Bedminster Patch reported.

Avid hiker: Local police searched the hills around Temple's home and did not find him

Since going dark, Temple’s cell phone has been turned off – he previously called his girlfriend every morning – and he has not had any bank or credit card activity, the News said. He also left his passport at home and left with only his backpack.

Bedminster Police will contact the NYPD for a mugshot and information about Temple’s condition at the time of his arrest, including his mental state, the News reported.

Had the arresting officer been aware Temple was reported missing, he could only urge him to contact loved ones, Patch reported.

He has not been seen or heard from since the arrest.

‘We would have liked him to contact his family and friends, but we didn't get that opportunity,’ Ussery told NJ.com. ‘All we can say is that NYPD had contact with our missing person, and we still consider him missing and endangered.’

Off the grid: Temple has not used his cell phone, credit or debit cards since disappearing in June

First made public in a June 27 press release from the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office, Temple’s disappearance has baffled family, friends and investigators.

A number of non-profits, including Crime Stoppers of Somerset County and LostNMissing, have spearheaded the effort to find Temple with billboards across northern New Jersey.

Police have also combed the woods around Temple’s home looking for the avid hiker as well.

Temple’s family has set up a Facebook page and offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to his discovery. Additionally, his brother Nick Temple is planning to fly from England to aid in the search, according to the News.

Described as 5-foot-8, 175 pounds, with hazel eyes, greying hair and a mole on the left side of his nose, anyone who sees Temple is urged to call Crime Stoppers at 1-88-577-TIPS (8477).
