James Rodriguez has given Real Madrid fans a boost that he is bouncing back to full-fitness from injury after posting an Instagram video on Thursday.

The 23-year-old hasn't featured for the Spanish giants since breaking his fifth metatarsal in his right foot against Sevilla earlier this month.

The Colombian was expected to be out for around eight weeks with the injury, but he appears to be making good progress judging by his social media upload.

Accompanied with the caption: 'Third week and feeling good, Stronger than ever', the midfielder can be seen going through plyometric exercises to enhance his athletic performance through speed and strength.

Up until his injury, Rodriguez had played a pivotal role at Real following his summer arrival from AS Monaco.

The £63million acquisition had scored seven goals and provided seven assists in 22 matches this season - helping Carlo Ancelotti's side to the European Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup in the process.

Free from European duty this week, a well-rested Real  heads into this weekend's La Liga matches looking to maintain its lead at the top of the table.

The 10-time European champions, who hold a four-point lead over Barcelona, host Villarreal on Sunday.

Ahead of that match Luka Modric could return to Real's match day squad after recovering from a hip injury he sustained while on international duty in November with Croatia.
