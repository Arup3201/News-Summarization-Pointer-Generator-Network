From one of the world’s greatest fighters who is on a missionary visit to the Far East to a very local lad bearing a grudge in Liverpool, this is the first hectic weekend of boxing’s new winter season.

Manny Pacquiao will try to put a potential billion dollar fight with Floyd Mayweather out of his mind so as to concentrate on beating American challenger Chris Algieri in Macau.

Defeat for the PacMan in a catch-weight defence of his world welterweight title against a little-known light-welter champion would be a disaster commercially as well as for his legacy.

With talks reportedly on-going with Mayweather for the mega event the world has been waiting so long to see, this is a fight Pacquiao cannot afford to lose.

Not with his promoter Bob Arum striving to open up the huge Chinese boxing market to its first pay-per-view fight.

Not that he is likely to be beaten.

Arum will be anxious that China’s own boxing idol, three-time world amateur champion and double Olympic gold medallist Zou Shiming, wins as well.

Shiming’s success is the key to persuading the Beijing government to permit subscription television for his fights.

Expect him to prevail, also. Amusingly, against a Thai flyweight who looks so much like Pacquiao that they call him Mini-Manny.

Another, even greater, ex-amateur finds himself on this bill in the remarkable position of defending a world title in only his third professional fight.

Ukraine’s Vasyl Lomachenko takes on a Thai who, with 52 wins from his 53 fights, comes from the opposite end of the boxing spectrum.

Earlier this Saturday night, on Merseyside, Tony Bellew angrily seeks home-town revenge for his previous defeat by former light-heavyweight world champion Nathan Cleverly.

The hostile build-up, brilliantly stage-managed by promoter Eddie Hearn, has elevated a fight between two men who were each knocked out in recent world title fights into a pay-per-view Battle of Britain on Sky Sports television.

Some selling job, this.

However, this is a competitive match-up in its own right. It is also a good mix of styles between Bellew the slugger from the streets and Cleverly the stylist with a university degree in mathematics.

Bellew’s hunger for redemption should make him more dangerous this time around and Cleverly will need to have recovered his appetite for boxing if he is to repeat his victory and be the one moving on towards a world cruiser-weight title bid.

George Groves may be given a sharp work-out by Denis Douglin in his latest come-back fight from that devastating Wembley Stadium KO by Carl Froch.

The rest of the starry cast-list on Hearn’s packed promotion – including Scott Quigg and Jamie McDonnell in WBA title defences - should improve their records with victories ranging from comfortable to one-sided.
