The Government is set to allow supermarkets to continue to sell mince which is less than 50 per cent meat despite EU rules aiming to crack down on mislabelling of food.

Officials say that stopping retailers from bulking up mince with fat and connective tissue would cost the industry hundreds of thousands of pounds a year.

But with the revelation following closely on from the recent horsemeat scandal, it could raise further fears that Britons are inadvertently eating impure food.

EU regulations set to be introduced next year will impose strict limits on the amount of fat and collagen which can be included in minced beef and pork.

Lean beef mince will be allowed to contain no more than 19 per cent filler, while regular beef mince will have up to 35 per cent.

Minced pork will be allowed nearly as much filler as meat, with a maximum of 48 per cent collagen and fat.

Collagen, which is best known for its role in cosmetic surgery, is a protein found in animals' tendons.

Currently a large proportion of the meat on British supermarket shelves breaches the purity regulations, meaning it could no longer be labelled as mince once the EU rules came into force.

Ministers have therefore asked for an exemption - or 'derogation' - to the new regulations in order to safeguard the UK's food industry, according to the Daily Telegraph.

In an 'impact assessment' of the rules issued last year, officials wrote: 'A significant proportion of mince meat currently sold in the UK contains a greater proportion of collagen than would be permitted.

'Adopting this derogation avoids costs to businesses arising from not being able to sell such minced meat in the UK as minced meat.'

The Government claims that if the regulations were imposed in full, they would cost food manufacturers more than Â£800,000 a year.

However, Labour MP Barry Gardiner attacked ministers for failing to safeguard consumers, describing the plans as a 'national disgrace'.

'Why should British people eat mince which is not the same standard as the rest of Europe?', he said to the Telegraph.

'They seem to be more concerned with wiping out regulations than in what consumers are eating.'

A spokesman for the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said that a 'final decision' had not yet been made on how to implement the rules.

'These regulations are about striking the right balance between improved information for consumers and red tape on food businesses,' he added.

Minced meat has been in the headlines over the past few weeks after it emerged that a number of supermarkets had been selling hamburgers which contained horse meat.

The contaminated mince came from a factory in Ireland, which blamed it on a supplier in Poland.
