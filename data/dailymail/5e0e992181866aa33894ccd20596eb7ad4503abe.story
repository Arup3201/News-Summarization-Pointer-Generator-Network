You have honed your CV to perfection, and put on your best interview suit.

You are confident you have really done your homework on the job you’ve applied for.

And then you come face to face with your prospective boss, only to be asked: ‘Who would win in a fight between Superman and Batman?’

A survey of 2,000 adults across the UK reveals bizarre questions asked to candidates by employers in job interviews, including: 'Who do you think would win in a fight between Superman (right) and Batman (left)?'

Another peculiar question asked to potential new employees was: 'Who is your favourite Doctor Who?'

Or perhaps: ‘If a hippo falls in a hole how would you get it out?’ Or: ‘What type of ice cream are you?’

These are among the bizarre questions firms are asking during interviews to ambush job hopefuls.

They emerged in a survey of 2,000 adults by the Association of Accounting Technicians.

Bosses trying to see whether candidates flounder or flourish when grilled on unexpected subjects also asked: ‘What dinosaur would you like to be?’

Candidates also reported finding themselves confronted with strange tasks, such as being asked to sing or improvise a scene from a film with a potential colleague. One baffled job-seeker was told: ‘Build a tower of paper cups in one minute that would not fall down when you put the water in the top cup.’

Top of the list of hardest questions faced was, ‘What are your weaknesses?’ followed by, ‘Describe yourself in three words’. Other tough lines of inquiry included, ‘Describe a time when you have failed’ and ‘What do you think the chief executive thinks of the company?’

Not surprisingly, 30 per cent of respondents said they had given awkward or cringeworthy responses. Some admitted bursting into tears or being caught out by a lie on their CV, while others revealed they had forgotten what job they were applying for or simply dried up.

Nearly two-thirds said they had embarrassed themselves by making gaffes such as spilling drinks, tripping over or swearing by accident. Stuttering, going red, sweating profusely or saying something stupid were other common experiences. 

The survey revealed other strange questions asked by employers included: 'Was the book Frankenstein (left) really about state control?', 'Do you like to sing in the bath?' and 'Is a Jaffa cake (right) a cake or biscuit?'

Aimee Batemann of AAT said: ‘The range of random and sometime unbelievable questions or tasks candidates have been subjected to shows sometimes you just can’t predict what will be thrown at you. However, the best way to maintain composure and reduce the chances of embarrassment is to try to prepare for every possibility and be prepared to think on your feet if need be.’

Most applicants thought their fate had been sealed within five minutes of entering the room, regardless of how the interview went after that. Some interviewers seemed ‘bored’ and others were ‘really rude’.

A number flouted laws about asking personal questions such as whether applicants planned to have children or were in a relationship.

Despite all the pitfalls, a third said they had still got the job.
