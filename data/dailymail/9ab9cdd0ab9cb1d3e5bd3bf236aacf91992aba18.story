The New York man accused of killing an entire Brooklyn family in a brutal hit-and-run crash last month leading to his arrest across state lines is defending himself while saying 'accidents happen.'

'Sure I played a part, I couldn't stop. Accidents happen,' Julio Acevedo told WABC News in a jailhouse interview while being held without bond on three counts of vehicular manslaughter in the March 3 crash.

Nachman and Raizel Glauber, as well as their infant son, were killed as the 21-year-old couple rushed to deliver their baby at a hospital. Their hired vehicle collided with Acavedo's on the streets of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Minor role: Julio Acevedo, held on three counts of vehicular manslaughter, says he played a minor part in the death of a young New York couple and their infant son but has pleaded not guilty to his charges

Their son, delivered by cesarean 
section, died the next day of extreme prematurity due to blunt-force 
injuries to his mother, who was seven months pregnant and was thrown 
from the hired car, the city medical examiner's office said. The couple were only married one year when the tragic accident happened.

Acavedo fled the scene but turned himself in four days later in Pennsylvania.

He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, including speeding at 70 MPH. He blames the couple's livery cab driver for running a stop sign, leading to the crash.

'Let's ask the cab driver, why did he run the stop sign?' he asked. 'He was in more of a rush than I was. He was rushing the woman to the hospital.'

Acavedo previously told the Daily News that he was fleeing a gunman trying to shoot at him when his borrowed BMW 
slammed into the Glaubers' hired car.

He told the newspaper he fled 
because he was worried he would be killed. But police said there were no
reports of shots fired in the area at the time of the wreck.

The Glaubers' driver, Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32, has told police that he doesn't remember anything after being knocked unconscious in the wreck.

'I'm made out to be the monster in all 
this,' Acevedo told ABC. 'I can't bring 'em back, it was an accident. I 
apologize deeply,' he said.

Asked if he would have done anything different, he says he wouldn't have left the scene like he did.

'Now knowing what I'm going through, I would have stayed,' he said. 'I was afraid of being treated unjustly, as I was in 1987.'

In that year he was charged with the murder of a man known as the original ‘50 Cent,’ Kelvin Martin.

Local gangsters wanted Martin dead and so kidnapped Acavedo and forced him to carry out the hit or they'd kill him and his family.

'He was my best friend at the time,' Acevedo said. 'I was forced to kill him.'

Avacedo
was sentenced to 20 years to life for Martin's death before the 
Brooklyn District Attorney's office found evidence proving Avacedo's 
claims to be true.

'They sat on the information until Acevedo got wind of it,' his attorney Scott Brettschneider told ABC.

Avavedo was released after spending 10 years in prison.

'I don't trust the system, I don't believe in it. I've been through it. I hope to be treated fairly, that's it,' he told ABC.

Just two weeks before the deadly crash in Williamsburg, Acevedo was stopped by police for driving erratically and his blood alcohol level was far above the legal level at .13.

He told police he had drunk just two beers at a baby shower before he was pulled over. He was charged with a DWI but released the next day without bail.

Impact: Roughly one thousand community members in Brooklyn's close-knit ultra-Orthodox Jewish community turned out for the couple's funeral while demanding justice for their death

Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for the 
family's Orthodox Jewish community, called Acevedo a 'coward' before his
arrest and demanded he be charged with three murders.

'We in the community are demanding that 
the prosecutor charge the driver of BMW that caused the death of this 
couple and infant ... with triple homicide,' Abraham said in a 
statement. 'This coward left the scene of the accident not even 
bothering to check on the people of the other car.'

The couple belonged to a close-knit ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, which is home to the largest community of ultra-Orthodox Jews outside Israel, more than 250,000. They were members of the Satmar Hasidic sect.

Nachman Glauber, whose family founded a line of clothing for Orthodox Jews, was studying at a rabbinical college. Raizy Glauber grew up in a prominent rabbinical family.

The couple's son was buried near their graves, a community spokesman said. About a thousand community members turned out for the couple's funeral a day earlier.
