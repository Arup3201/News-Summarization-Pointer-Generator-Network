Contrary to previous reports, rumours originating from Germany are now claiming that Apple's next iPhone could be on sale by 6 September.

According to what translations of German blog iFun calls a 'credible and very serious source', the iPhone 5S could 'come on the market' by the start of September, which suggests it could be announced at the end of August.

The source also added weight to rumours about a second, cheaper model and even a large-screen iPad being announced the same day by claiming Apple will unveil 'two new types of devices' in addition to the iPhone 5S.

Contrary to previous reports, the latest rumours from Germany are now claiming Apple's iPhone 5S could be on sale by 6 September. Leaked photos, pictured, also suggest a cheaper model could be called iPhone C

Chinese site ETNews believes Apple could discontinue the iPhone 5 to focus solely on its rumoured, upcoming new models.

Earlier this year, industry analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets claimed Apple was working on a low-cost handset.

Dubbed iPhone Mini, iPhone Lite and now  iPhone C, the new handset could come in a range of colours, be made
of plastic, have a 3.5inch screen and a 5MP camera.

Prices being quoted range from £63 ($99) to £260 ($400).

Apple is also believed to working on large-screen device for its iPhone 6 model. The iPhone 6 could have a 4.7-inch screen.

There may also be a 5.7-inch screen iPhone model due next year.

The iPhone 5S was expected to be released on 13 September, with the cheaper version due at the start of October.

Production
problems are now said to have pushed this date back, meaning the iPhone
Lite could be released before the high-end iPhone 5.

Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal claimed suppliers in Asia had said Apple recently asked for prototypes of screens 
that are larger than 4-inches for the iPhone.

It is also said to be testing larger 13-inch iPad displays.

This would make a jumbo iPad more than three inches bigger than the 
current model.

Apple has unveiled a new handset every year since it announced the first iPhone in 2007.

The first four models - iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4 - were all unveiled in June and went on sale around a week or so later.

More recent models, including the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5, were announced in October 2011 and September 2012 respectively.

Rumours of a summer release for the iPhone 5S began in April this year when sources close to the electronics 
giant, including manufacturers, leaked details that production had started.

Reports from an American magazine in May
suggested the iPhone 5S would be announced on 10 September and go on 
sale ten days later.

Then last week, reports from China 
claimed the release could be pushed back until the end of September and
possibly October because of 'production problems'. 

The iPhone 5S is rumoured to have internet speeds around ten times as fast as 3G.

It is also poised to be released with
a built-in fingerprint scanner, and it is this technology that was 
believed to be causing the delay.

The 
new iPhone 5S model is expected to look identical to the current iPhone 5 but 
includes a faster processor and updated camera.

It will also run iOS 7, the major new version of Apple's iPad and iPhone software launched in June.

Reporter Dave Smith from IBT said:
'By all accounts, the iPhone 5S will look identical its predecessor the
iPhone 5, with the exception of a few cosmetic changes.

This image claims to show the 
case of the new iPhone 5S. Published by French website Nowhereelese.fr, 
the differences in attachment points suggest an update 
to the Apple phone expected to go on sale on 6 September

'Apple
has reportedly adopted dual-LED flash for its rear-facing camera, which
means that circular flash is now pill-shaped, and many believe the 
iPhone 5S camera has been improved from the 8-megapixels in the iPhone 
5, likely to 12-megapixels.

He added that iPhone 5S has also reportedly 
received a battery upgrade from the iPhone 5's 5.45 Whr capacity to a 
higher capacity of 5.92 Whr.

In June, rumours claimed that the California-based company was also set to launch a low-cost version of its iPhone 5 handset as early as September.

The iPhone Mini could cost as little as £63, although analysts have also priced it up to around £260. The backing case could be made of coloured plastic according to images shown on Chinese site WeiPhone, pictured

According to site MacRumours, photos leaked in mid-June show that iPhone 5S will be the first to feature a new A7 chip designed by Apple and a higher capacity battery

It will be the first time in Apple's iPhone history that the company has unveiled two handsets in the same month.

It was originally dubbed iPhone Mini, then iPhone Lite, and now leaked pictures from WeiPhone showing plastic cases suggest it could be called the iPhone C.

The cheaper handset is expected to be made of plastic to keep costs
down and may be sold in a range of colours including white, black, pink
and blue.

According to analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets, the iPhone Mini could be made of plastic and could cost as little as £63 ($99).

Other prices put it much higher at £260 ($400) and it is likely to be closer in price to Apple's iPhone 4.

Apple does not comment on future products before its launch events.

The
speculation seems to contradict comments made by Phil Schiller, 
Apple's marketing chief, who told Chinese newspaper the 
Shanghai Evening News earlier this year that 'despite the popularity of cheap smartphones,
this well never be the future of Apple's products.'

Other rumours include that Apple
could launch a 4.7inch iPhone model - which would put it in close competition 
with Samsung's 4.8inch Galaxy SIII - as well as a 5.7inch 
'phablet-style' device.

A Chinese source claims the company 
will stop making its current flagship phone when it releases its next handset.

The reports claim Apple wants to focus its attentions on, and ultimately promote more sales of, the newer designs.

Elsewhere, a different Chinese source sparked rumours Apple could soon announced a 13-inch iPad after the company had requested larger touchscreens.

Accessory manufacturer Tactus published a picture of a cheap, plastic iPhone model earlier this year. The design is rumoured to have a 3.5inch screen and 5MP camera and could cost as little as £63 ($99)
