David Moyes was still barking out the orders in English on the rain-swept pitches of Real Sociedad's Zubieta training ground this week, shouting: 'Chance to score, you should score!' at players over-elaborating in front of goal in the morning six-a-sides.

It will be a while before he's directing his new charges in Spanish but ahead of his first Basque derby on Sunday night, midfielder Esteban Granero has reassured him: 'Nothing is being lost in translation'.

Moyes has already been teased for a recent press conference when he dared try out his first few words in Spanish 'dos, tres, cuatro' before reverting to English but Granero knows all about the language barrier from his days playing under Harry Redknapp at Queens Park Rangers.

The midfielder claims he finds Moyes' accent easier to undertstand than his former boss Harry Redknapp

'Harry's accent was tough, David is easier to understand,' says the former Real Madrid midfielder who also played under Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini. 'We have a translator who is doing an excellent job and English is not such a strange language for us to understand. There are five or six players who speak the language and our goalkeeper Eñaut Zubikarai has also started classes.'

Granero was the player Moyes mistakenly referred to Stefano in his opening match in charge but the midfielder has pointed to another top British coach who thrived in San Sebastian without having the greatest command of Spanish.

John Toshack won the Spanish cup in 1987 with La Real but was also famous for turning standard English phrases such as 'headless chicken' and 'pigs might fly' directly into Spanish, much to the amusement and bemusement of fans.

Granero said: 'Toshack is a legend here and not just because of those phrases, but it's true they only added to the legend. We have a very important job to do here and that eclipses everything else. There might be a little thing that makes you laugh from time to time but that in no way affects the authority of the manager. We know he is the boss and we are ready to follow what he asks of us.

'He has arrived at a moment when we have more desire than ever to learn and improve. Anything he says to us, to that end, be it in Spanish, English or Chinese is important and will be taken in.'

Real Sociedad have not posed as great a threat this season after selling star player Antoine Griezmann

New signing Alfred Finnbogason has struggled to score following his 7.5m euros move

Moyes has not got it easy. The team reached the Champions League two seasons ago and finished seventh last year but much of that was down to French winger Antoine Griezmann who scored 16 goals in the last campaign but moved to Atletico Madrid in the summer for 30m euros.

The club spent 7.5m euros of that money on a new record signing before the season started brining in 25-year-old Icelandic international Alfred Finnbogason but after one training session this week he could be seen being given one-to-one tuition on receiving the ball on the half turn by Moyes' new assistant Billy McKinlay – basic stuff for such an expensive acquisition. The new striker has so far been a massive disappointment, and elsewhere the squad could do with a couple of new signings, preferably in January.

The biggest single message from the manger to his players since he arrived a month ago has been to drive home the need for greater intensity and aggression and it is a message that Granero, as a former Mourinho player, is no stranger to.

'For Mourinho the aggression was very important,' he says. 'We were up against a Barcelona side at their absolute peak and it was almost impossible to get the ball off of them yet we still managed to win the league and beat them in the Cup Final and that was due, in no small part, to us imposing ourselves physically.

'At QPR Harry was the same; he wanted his team to be aggressive. In the Premier League if you are not aggressive then you don't touch the ball.

'When I first moved to England I would find myself stopping during games thinking that the referee was going to give a foul but the whistle never came. It took me a while to readjust when I came back to Spain. David will get used to the different refereeing here.'

That reference to the match officials is an important one. Moyes can demand his team be more physical but he has to factor in the philosophy of many match officials that every foul is a yellow card.

There will be other cultural differences to be overcome but Granero says Premier League football and La Liga fútbol are no longer miles apart in terms of style.

'Give it a few more years and there will be almost no difference at all,' he says. 'Where there is a still a difference perhaps is with the forming of young players and how good the youth academies are in Spain but the British aren't stupid and they know that mixing the aggression and the physicality of their football with a better way of educating young players - something they have been doing for the last six or seven years will end up giving them a very strong team. Give it another decade maximum and England will have one of the strongest teams in Europe again.'

Granero speaks positively about Moyes since his arrival at Sociedad

One of the special things about Sunday night's derby is that almost all the players on both sides will be homegrown. Athletic Bilbao retain their Basque-only policy and Real Sociedad still learn heavily on their Zubieta accademy.

Moyes was five games into his reign as Manchester United manager last season when he faced his first Manchester derby. On Sunday night he finds himself facing his first Basque derby, once again, five games into a new job.

United were beaten 4-1 by Manchester City last September and it was the first sign that not everyone was playing for the new man. It's a very different scenario at La Real where players have been buoyed by his arrival. Granero believes he can lead them back towards the Champions League.

Moyes was brought to the Spanish club to realise their ambition of returning top the Champions League

He said: 'That is the challenge. The president wants it and I think the coach has come for that. We achieved it last season and we want it again. We know we have to go one step at a time but we have to be confident and ambitious.

'We know we have to improve and we look to David as the key to that. He has prestige as a coach and this is a prestigious club. His ideas are very clear and he is really motivated. He wants to coach a big club and we want that the big club to be Real Sociedad. Getting back in the Champions League is the challenge; it is what we all want.'

Granero was straight on to the phone to close friend Juan Mata when Moyes was confirmed as his new coach. 'He spoke very highly of him. We all know what the big clubs are like – the criticism comes quickly and the coach always pays. But Juan said to me that he was unlucky there and that he would have liked for them to have shown a little bit more patience with him. Their loss is now our gain.'

The Basque derby is Spain's friendliest derby. 'Not unlike the Merseyside derby' says Granero who played in two West London derbies in his season under Redknapp. He won the fixture at Stamford Bridge getting the better of Rafa Benitez in charge at the time.

Granero also played for current Manchester City manager Pellegrini at Real Madrid and comparing the Chilean to Mourinho he said: 'They are a lot more alike than people would imagine. They each project a very different image but the reality is Pellegrini shows plenty of fire in the dressing room and Mourinho usually stays very calm.'

Granero insists there is more than meets the eye with his former boss Redknapp

He also says Redknapp does not quite fit the image he projects. 'There is more to Harry than meets the eye. He is a lot more studious and far more on top of things tactically than it seems. He can seem to be someone who is not completely on top of the training sessions but he is aware of everything that is happening. He is very intelligent. You don't stay in football that long without that intelligence.'

If Moyes wants to stay in Spanish football at Real Sociedad long term, getting the better of La Real's local rivals will be vital. His side will move to within two points of Athletic Bilbao if they can get the win the game.

There has been a warm welcome for him on Spain's cold, wet northern coast. 'He has come to the right place,' says Granero. 'We hope he stays.'
