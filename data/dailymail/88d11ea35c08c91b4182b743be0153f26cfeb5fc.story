This is the moment a sailor was pulled from the Pacific Ocean after he  survived 100 minutes in the freezing water, which left him hearing voices and close to death.

Andrew Taylor was swept overboard and battled 66ft waves in conditions he described as 'like being in a washing machine'.

He was uncertain his crew had even noticed he was missing but was determined to survive because 'it would be unfair on mum to die on her birthday', he said.

Mr Taylor was thrown in the sea eight months into the Clipper Round the World Race and watched the yacht disappear over the horizon.

Fearing his legs were both broken after being hit by the rudder, hypothermia then set in and he began hallucinating and hearing voices.

But he had activated  his emergency beacon and the boat returned almost two hours later to rescue him - and a doctor on board saved him by packing him in a sleeping bag filled with hot water bottles.

Extraordinary: Andrew Taylor is pulled aboard from the Pacific after spending almost two hours in the water 

Determined: The sailor was hallucinating and close to death when his team returned to find him during a round-the-world race

Survivor: Mr Taylor, from Oxford, recovered on board and went on to complete the round-the-world race (pictured speaking afterwards)

Incredibly Mr Taylor, from Oxford, recovered on board and went on to complete the round-the-world race.

He has now turned his diary entries from the trip into a book and will donate the profits to charity.

'It was like being in a washing machine,' he said, recalling the dramatic March 2014 rescue.

The 47-year-old continued: 'I thought I was going to die but decided, "It would be unfair on mum to die today".'

He described the lead up to the incident which took place eight months into the race.

'The conditions were rough and storms were coming in,' he said. 'Our sails were too big for the weather and the boat had become difficult to handle.

'We had to change the sails.'

While Mr Taylor was doing this, a wave crashed on board and dragged him overboard.

He said: 'It took a fraction of a second and I had no time to react. One minute I was on board, the next I was in the water.

'I tried to take a breath but it was too cold. I waited for my safety line to snag then realised it wasn't attached to the boat.

'Then I was hit by the rudder, which, at 15ft high and 6in thick, ran over me. I thought my legs were broken as I watched the boat disappear.

'I swore as it went over the horizon and thought about my last conversation with the skipper, Sean McCarter, about going to get a tool.

'I wondered if my crewmates had seen me fall off the boat.'

Grabbed: A member of the crew  swings in to the water to grab the stricken sailor, who took three attempts to get back aboard

Saved: Mr Taylor was stripped and warmed up using large amounts of hot water bottles packed into a sleeping bag

Mr Taylor said at this point he was sure the yacht would return for him soon.

He said: 'We'd trained in 'man overboard' so I activated the AIS beacon, attached to me, which I knew would show my location on a screen on the boat.

'I thought the boat would stop, turn round and pick me up.

'I pulled the pin out of my beacon and it started flashing.

'I checked the straps on my life jacket were tight and it was fully inflated, then I waited for the boat.

'I thought it would be back in around 15 minutes.

'I was confident the boat would return.

'For a long time I saw the boat in the distance and thought it must have stopped.

'I saw the mast but only a glimpse of the deck and thought, 'If I can't see the deck, they can't see me'.'

Mr Taylor said he began to wonder if his beacon had worked and alerted the crew to his disappearance.

He continued: 'I was constantly under the waves. The water was white. It felt like I was in a washing machine.

'With time I realised I was in a bad place. I was suffering with the cold. I started to drift off as I struggled to stay conscious.

'I felt relaxed, comfortable, euphoric and knew these were signs of hypothermia.

'I knew going to sleep would mean game over. I had to focus on myself, my job was staying alive.

'So I turned to face the wind hoping to get cold and stay awake. I talked to myself about family and friends and I remembered my mum's birthday.

'I was annoyed and disappointed that I hadn't messaged her yet that day. I decided it was unfair to die on mum's birthday and that gave me strength.

'That was the biggest thing that kept me going.'

Then he began to hear voices.

Mr Taylor said: 'I thought my mind was playing tricks on me but I focussed on them and they seemed to be getting louder.

'Suddenly the boat was bearing down on me. It was enormous.

'I saw some people and made eye contact. My friend Jason Middleton was already in the water in a harness.'

Journey: Mr  Taylor was on board the Derry Londonderry Doire yacht, pictured leaving the dock in London, at the Clipper 13-14 Race start last year

Celebrating:  Andrew Taylor is second left here on a stopover in China before he was thrown overboard last March

Conditions: But later the boat was being hit with huge waves in the Pacific, which in the end swept off Mr Taylor and nearly killed him

The team on board tried to grab hold of Mr Taylor, attach him to Mr Middleton's harness and haul him up out of the water. It took three goes.

He said: 'By the third attempt I wondered if I had the energy and would get on the boat. I was cold inside me, my face was sore and my body was aching.

'It felt like I was being run over by a bus. I couldn't get my breath. I felt like I could drown.'

Turnaround: Mr Taylor's legs were bruised and swollen and after he had six days intensive physiotherapy he then decided he wanted to carry on with the race

Finally, with the whole crew forging together, Mr Taylor was pulled out of the water almost two hours after he'd gone overboard.

He said: 'It felt like a lifetime, everyone was working hard. I don't know where I got the strength to get back on board. I collapsed face first.'

Mr Taylor was taken below deck and put in a sleeping bag which was packed with bottles filled with hot water, to warm him up.

He said: 'For the next four hours my muscles ached and I was in and out of consciousness. I was treated for hypothermia and Susie Redhouse, the medic, monitored me for the next 48 hours.'

Mr Taylor's legs were bruised and swollen.

He had six days intensive physiotherapy then decided he wanted to carry on with the race.

He said: 'It's called round the world for a reason and I planned to get back on board. It was intensely difficult and I was physically sick beforehand.

'But the last four months of the race were tremendously enjoyable, and we finished fourth.'

Mr Taylor has now turned his experience into a book.

He called it 179W – One Seven Nine West, named after the exact coordinates where he went overboard.

Proceeds from the sale of his book will go to Mr Taylor's chosen charities – The Ellen Macarthur Cancer Trust and The Newmarket Day Centre.
