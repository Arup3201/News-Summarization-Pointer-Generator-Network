When Everton's Joel Robles and West Ham's Adrian were trying to put off those taking penalties during their FA Cup shoot-out, referee Neil Swarbrick was losing patience with the goalkeepers.

Robles and Adrian were warned by the official for their antics several times and told to return to their line to wait for the penalty to be taken.

But, with Robles already cautioned, the 24-year-old was on thin ice, especially when Swarbrick approached him with a yellow card in his hand. So, could the Everton goalkeeper have been sent off for a second bookable offence during the shoot-out that finished 9-8 in West Ham's favour?

'If the goalkeeper is sent off during the taking of kicks from the penalty mark, he shall be replaced by a player who finished the match.' 

FIFA and FA rules state  a goalkeeper can be sent off during a shoot-out, whether for a second yellow or straight red, and only a player that finished the match can replace him in goal. 

At Upton Park, Swarbrick approached Robles to give him a telling off, holding a yellow card in his hand, though the referee could have been using it to pencil in those that scored and missed their spot-kicks. 

But the Spaniard was one wrong move away from being dismissed, and he would not have been the first in football either.

The only other reported sending off for a goalkeeper during a penalty shoot-out came in a Cosafa Cup quarter-final between Botswana and Malawi on May 25, 2003.

Botswana goalkeeper Modiri Marumo got a pat on the back by opposite number Philip Nyasulu, and reacted by 'punching him in the face'.

'I over-reacted in an exchange of words between myself and my counterpart,' Marumo said. 'This unbecoming behaviour has not only embarrassed me, but also the organisation that I work for, the Botswana Defence Force (BDF).

'I hope my apology would be recognised and I pledge my commitment in serving the nation.'

Putting off those taking penalties was taken to another level by Holland's Tim Krul during the 2014 World Cup, with Louis van Gaal bringing the Newcastle United goalkeeper on purely for the shoot-out.

Krul screamed 'Vamos!' in the face of Costa Rica's every penalty taker in Salvador during the quarter-final, but the Dutchman did not regret doing so as it earned Holland the win.  

‘I don’t think I did anything wrong. I didn’t shout in an aggressive manner,' insisted Krul. ‘I did everything in my power and I would be happy to do it again, absolutely no problem. 

'There are no regrets. I was ready for the moment. I told them I knew where they were going and I had analysed it. I tried to get in their heads and it worked.'
