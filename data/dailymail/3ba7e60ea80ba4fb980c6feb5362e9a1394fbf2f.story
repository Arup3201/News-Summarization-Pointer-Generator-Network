A father-of-six claimed he was made to feel like a paedophile after being forced to hand over his phone during a visit to his daughter's primary school. 

David Burns walked out of Tregolls School in Truro, Cornwall, after staff told him to leave his mobile phone at reception in case he took unauthorised photos of children. 

The 56-year-old hit out at the school's policy, saying staff 'couldn't treat the whole world like paedophiles'.

But the school defended its decision and said the rule had been introduced as the 'ultimate safeguarding solution'.

Mr Burns and wife Amy had gone to the school to see a display of their 10-year-old daughter Jasmine's artwork. 

When he was told to leave his phone, he explained to staff that he needed to be constantly available in case his eldest son George, who has Asperger's Syndrome, had to contact him.

He walked out after staff responded they were sorry, but that he couldn't go into the school with a mobile phone in case he took pictures. 

He said: 'I was flabbergasted. I didn't go in and my wife Amy went in alone to see our daughter's work. I went back outside and waited in the car - I was so angry. I am a parent - not a paedophile.

'Does the school really think we're going to go in waving a camera around taking pictures of other kids?  You can't treat the whole world like they're paedophiles - we're parents.'

Tregolls School defended the decision, and said they had introduced the ruling as the 'ultimate safeguard' last year and said it even applies to teachers and other staff.

Posters detailing the policy are displayed on the main entrance door to the school.

Sara Cadge, chair of governors at the school, said: 'The rule applies to absolutely everyone.

'When Henry Winkler the American actor came here he handed in his phone and when Ofsted inspectors visited they did as well. We felt this was the ultimate safeguarding solution.

'When it was introduced last year, it was off the back of very high profile cases in London where teachers had actually been found guilty of inappropriate behaviour.

'Our staff said they never want those accusations coming their way. It is to protect themselves and to protect the children.

'We can also not have children in the school being put onto social media inadvertently.'

A spokesman for the Department of Education said such a policy would be a matter for the individual school. 

It comes just months after the issue of photographing children in schools made headlines after parents were ordered to remove a video of their daughter's nativity from social media.

Douglas Holmes said his four-year-old daughter Emmi-Rai had played the role of innkeeper in her nativity play at Ynysboeth Primary School in Abercynon.

His partner Lisa Evans filmed their daughter's performance and posted the video on Facebook.

But the next day she was asked to take it down by a teacher who appeared in the video because of concerns of the online safety of pupils. 

Official guidance issued by the Information Commissioner's Office states that parents should be able to take photos of their children at events such as school plays and sports days, without fear of breaching the Data Protection Act. 

Advice posted on its website states: 'The Data Protection Act is unlikely to apply in most cases where photographs or videos are taken in schools and other educational institutions.

'If photos are taken for personal use they are not covered by the Act.'
