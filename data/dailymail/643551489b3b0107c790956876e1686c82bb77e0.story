Bars, pubs and clubs are a priority for a quarter of Britons who go on holiday abroad, according to a survey.

Keeping the Brits abroad stereotype alive, some 24 per cent of 2,000 people questioned opted for a boozy break as their preferred type of trip.

However, the majority of holidaymakers said sunshine and warm weather were top of their holiday requirements list – with 64 per cent putting these as their main priority when booking a break away.

In second place, 60 per cent of travellers cited sites of local culture, artistic and historic interest as what they most look for in a holiday abroad, according to the findings by Moneycorp.

Tasting local foods (53 per cent), having time to read (39 per cent), and meeting local people (24 per cent) were next on the list.

These were followed by catching up on sleep (21 per cent) and outdoor activities (20 per cent).

Looking for love was last on the list, with only nine per cent of Brits admitting to going on holiday to find romance.

Vanessa Schotes, head of marketing for Travel Money at Moneycorp, said: ‘There are some wonderful cultural destinations around the world, so it’s no surprise that Brits are opting for holidays that broaden their horizons. 

‘With the pound currently riding a high against a number of currencies, travellers from the UK are able to pack even more cultural attractions into their itineraries this year.’
