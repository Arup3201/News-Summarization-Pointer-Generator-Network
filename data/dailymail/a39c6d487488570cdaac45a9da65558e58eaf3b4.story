Jonas Gutierrez has run the Buenos Aires Marathon in a bid to raise money and awareness for a cancer charity back home in Argentina.

The Newcastle United winger was diagnosed with testicular cancer last year, but only revealed he was battling the illness in September.

Gutierrez has had his left testicle removed, but the ensuing chemotherapy hasn’t stopped him from running the 26.2 mile course.

Gutierrez has seen support flood in from throughout the football world, including Manchester City’s Martin Demichelis, former Everton defender Alan Stubbs and current team-mate Papiss Cisse.
