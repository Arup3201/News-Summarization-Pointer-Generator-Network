New Charity Commission chairman William Shawcross yesterday signalled a break with his controversial predecessor, ‘quango queen’ Dame Suzi Leather, who was criticised for using the organisation for political purposes.

Dame Suzi, who angered Conservatives by mounting attacks on the Government, repeatedly threatened independent schools with the loss of their charitable status, thereby pushing up fees and potentially forcing their closure.

In contrast, Mr Shawcross, the biographer of the Queen Mother, said one of the roles of charities should be to help poor children to attend the ‘finest schools’.

He told the annual conference of the Women’s Institute in Cardiff: ‘I am sure that we here all agree that the nobility lies in the search to provide everyone with equality of opportunity.’ 

Mr Shawcross – who noted that the 160,000 British charities had an astonishing total income of £54 billion – added that his quango had a role to play in the fight against terrorism and the hijacking of charities by extremist outfits.

He said: ‘We in the commission know that evil often tries to subvert the innate generosity of the charitable impulse for terrorist purposes.

‘The whole country has been appalled 
by the acts of terror we have witnessed in recent years. We shall 
redouble our efforts against terrorist subversion of charities.’ 

Mr Shawcross, 67, also promised to tackle ‘the politicisation of charities’.

He said: ‘Any charity is free to campaign to further its basic aims. But no charity can be exclusively campaigning. We have to draw a line.’

In his speech, Mr Shawcross lauded the Women’s Institute’s contribution to the UK and how it ‘always got things done’.

The 4,000 members at the conference in Cardiff backed a resolution calling for action to  re-ignite Britain’s dwindling high streets.

Spokeswoman Marylyn Haines-Evans said: ‘I believe high streets have a viable and very real future. ‘It’s not about turning back the tide, it’s about supporting those that are fit  for purpose in the 21st Century.’
