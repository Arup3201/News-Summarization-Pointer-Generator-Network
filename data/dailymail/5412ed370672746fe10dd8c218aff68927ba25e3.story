A California farmer has smashed the record for the largest pumpkin in North America with a mighty gourd weighing in at a monstrous 2,058 pounds.

The white pumpkin made its public debut at the annual Half Moon Bay pumpkin weigh-off where it was quickly dubbed the 'colossal ghost' by festival organizers, NBC Bay Area reports.

The record-breaking pumpkin was grown by Napa's John Hawkley, who was just 265 pounds shy of taking the world record from Swiss grower Beni Meier who's 2,323 pound pumpkin was officially weighed just one day earlier in Germany.

It was the first time a Half Moon Bay Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off entrant had broken the ton-mark. 

Hawkley beat out 30 other California pumpkin growers to take the cash prize of more than $13,000.
