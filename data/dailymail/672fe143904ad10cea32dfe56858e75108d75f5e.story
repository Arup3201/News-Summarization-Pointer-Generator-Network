A pensioner whose husband was knocked
down and killed went to court yesterday to help the driver responsible 
for the tragedy avoid a jail sentence.

Patricia Machin, 74, wrote a letter 
of support to motorist Brian Williamson, saying the ordeal had been 
‘1,000 times worse’ for him.

Mrs Machin even hugged the sobbing 
defendant as he left court having received a suspended sentence for 
causing the death of her 77-year-old husband Gerrard.

Brian Williamson has been spared jail thanks to the extraordinary forgiveness of Patricia Machin

‘I don’t feel any ill thoughts or grudges towards Brian, and I know Gerrard wouldn’t either,’ she said.

‘It isn’t that I have forgiven Brian,
it was that I never blamed him in the first place. It was a mistake. He
has suffered enough already and will have to live with what he did.

‘I didn’t want to see Brian going to prison, he is someone’s son after all.’

Mr Machin, a retired accountant, had 
been buying his morning paper in Bournemouth when he was knocked down by
Williamson’s Volkswagen Passat in December 2011.

When he failed to return home, Mrs 
Machin went looking for her husband of 13 years and discovered the 
aftermath of the collision.

Mrs Machin wrote Williamson a moving letter telling him how she would support him in court and that she didn't feel any bitterness towards him

‘I ran up the road and saw a pool of 
blood on the pavement, it was horrendous,’ she said. Despite her 
distress, Mrs Machin managed to console Williamson, who was ‘in bits’ at
the roadside. ‘It never occurred to me to blame him, I just thought 
“poor chap”.

‘It was the worst day of my life and, no doubt, the worst day of Brian’s life as well.’

Mr Machin was taken to hospital but died from multiple injuries two months later.

Williamson, 30, an aircraft engineer,
claimed he had not seen Mr Machin crossing the road as his vision was 
impaired by the glare of an oncoming vehicle. But he was found guilty of
causing death by careless driving.

A letter Mrs Machin, a retired 
medical assistant and a devout Christian, wrote to Williamson was shown 
to the judge at Bournemouth Crown Court.

Patricia Machin' letter to the CPS explained that she and her late husband would never want someone to suffer

In it she said: ‘Dear Brian. Today is
a very important day and I will be in court to support you. On the day 
of the accident, however bad it was for me, I realise it was 1,000 times
worse for you.

‘Neither Gerrard, if he was here, or I
feel any sense of condemnation towards you. Will you make me a promise,
that you will get on with your young life, knowing that you will always
be supported by my prayers?’

Scott Stemp, defending Williamson, 
said: ‘I struggle to find words to express what is conveyed through the 
contents and the intentions. It is truly astonishing.’

'You say you realise that I may be disappointed with your decision regarding the charge against Brian Williamson.

'I assume this to mean that you 
expect me to have wished for a harsher charge to have been brought 
against him... nothing could be further from the truth.

'I have never for a single second had any sort of angry or vengeful thoughts towards this young man.

'Even though at the time (of the accident) I was stood beside a pool of Gerrard's blood...I felt only pity for the driver.

'Gerrard would have nothing but 
compassion for Brian Williamson.

'This episode in our lives...will not 
contain any form of condemnation from our side.'

When she learnt that Williamson was 
being charged with causing her husband’s death, Mrs Machin wrote to the 
Crown Prosecution Service, which had said she might be disappointed he 
was not facing a more serious charge.

She told them: ‘Nothing could be 
further from the truth. I have never for a single second had any sort of
angry or vengeful thoughts towards this young man.

'Even though at the 
time I was stood beside a pool of Gerrard’s blood, I felt only pity for 
the driver.’

Judge Samuel Wiggs imposed a 
three-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months on Williamson, who 
now lives and works in Germany. He was also banned from driving for two 
years and fined £1,000.

Judge Wiggs said he had read the 
‘extremely moving letter’ from Mrs Machin and told Williamson: ‘You are 
very fortunate to have been forgiven.

‘There is no doubt that what happened
on that day was a tragedy for everyone, including you. Nevertheless you
were responsible.’

As he left court, Williamson said: 
‘My heart and thoughts go out to Mr Machin’s family. I’m always asking 
“what if?”. What if I had left 10 seconds later or earlier or had gone 
another way?’

A tearful Mrs Machin said: ‘I have 
had to get on with my life and I hope he can now do the same. Gerrard 
was an amazing man and a wonderful husband. I loved him so much.

‘We were incredibly happy and I have to be grateful that we were married, and incredibly happy, for 13 years.’
