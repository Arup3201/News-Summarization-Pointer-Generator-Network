In a galaxy far, far away he was one of the most feared crime bosses in the universe, with a particular distaste for plucky hero Han Solo.

But now the infamous Jabba the Hutt has appeared in our own galaxy - at least, in an animation showing weather patterns on Earth.

In the map, the face of the criminal overlord can be made out, with vortices representing his eyes and wind creating scaly, green skin.

Tokyo-based software engineer Cameron Beccario has created a weather map (shown) that looks like the infamous Star Wars character Jabba the Hutt. The animation shows wind speeds and weather patterns around the world. In the image Jabba's 'eyes' are represented by two vortices

The familiar pattern arose in an animated map showing global weather conditions called earth.nullschool.net.

Created by Tokyo-based software engineer Cameron Beccario, the image garnered considerable attention on social media networks when observers noted the similarity to the Star Wars character.

He said the wind map was a personal project used to learn how to develop web visualisations.

‘I originally found the image while playing around with the site, which I then posted on the site's facebook page,’ Mr Beccario, 39, told MailOnline.

According to meteorologist Tyler Hamilton from The Weather Network, the eyes represent ‘stationary vortices that are common during the winter months.’

The mouth is the ‘intertropical convergence zone’ (ITCZ), which is an area that circles Earth near the equator where northeast and southeast trade winds come together.

The pink eyebrows are high-speed winds moving more than 155mph (250km/h) in the upper atmosphere, while the other green lines show the motion of wind elsewhere in the world.

Light green shows the lowest intensity winds, moving up to red and then pink.

‘The combination of high altitude winds, colours, and equirectangular projection caused this humourous face to appear, and I couldn't stop laughing.

He noted that he thought it looked 'more like Oscar the Grouch' than Jabba the Hutt, but the resemblance to both characters is uncanny.

‘Of course, it's 100 per cent an artefact of the site's calculations,' he added.

'The website shows global wind data over a number of different altitudes, updated every three hours, from data made available by the US National Weather Service.'

'This particular image shows wind velocity at a pressure level of 10 hectopascals, which is roughly 26.5km [16/5 miles] up, as forecast by the US NWS on 19 January at 12.00 UTC.

'The colors vary with wind speed, as does the motion of the particles, which get faster as the wind speeds up. Note the projection introduces distortion, too.'

Of course, this map isn’t designed to replicate faces of famous movie character in weather patterns on Earth.

It’s actually a visualisation of global weather conditions that have been forecast by supercomputers.

The weather is updated every three hours, while ocean surface currents are updated every five days.

It uses data from the Global Forecast System (GFS), National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
