Parents have criticised a school which allowed only pupils who had hit academic targets to join in with a non-uniform day.

Children who had achieved their ‘accelerated reading target’ at Woodland Middle School in Flitwick, Bedfordshire, were allowed to wear their own clothes on Friday.

However, those who had fallen short had to stick with uniform.

One parent, who did not want to be named, said: ‘My son isn’t academic but he is good at other things. I understand that those who have hit their target deserve a reward but not by isolating those who haven’t.’

Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the idea was ‘the same as putting a dunce’s hat on a child’.

'I think it’s extremely discriminatory. It’s depressing for children who have to wear school uniform,' he said.

'The children should feel rewarded, a badge or a certificate is fine, but it’s like the achievment in itself isn’t good enough anymore.

'It could work if most of the school are hitting their targets but it would be cruel for the children who are in the school uniform.

'It’s the equivalent of putting a dunce’s hat on them in Victorian times. And of course, if only five to 10 per cent of pupils are hitting targets and wearing their own clothes they could also be bullied for it.

'It’s inappropriate, discriminatory and unwise in the worst possible sense.'

But Woodland Middle School, which caters for pupils aged nine to 13, defended its decision.

Deputy Headteacher, Sharon Hardacre, said: 'At Woodland Middle School we reward the positives as much as possible.

'One such reward is the use of a mufti day. Targets
 are not "unobtainable" or "aspirational" but rather will be achieved if
 the child reads books at their level and takes quizzes.'

And parent agreed, saying: 'I was really pleased that my son got a reward for reading, he had worked hard.

'I know people have different opinions but I don’t see the problem.'
