Disturbing footage has been shared on social media, showing young Australian men and women from a community in South East Queensland engaging in fight club-style street brawls. 

The video shows a compilation of brawls, as fighters throw punches, pull hair and tackle one another on the streets of Cherbourg, a town in the Burnett region of Queensland. 

One fight shows two young women bare-foot in the middle of the road, as dozens of onlookers, including children, witness the two throwing punches, pulling each other's hair and swinging each other towards the ground.

In another video, a spectator shouts 'That's it! That's it!', as a shirtless man in red pants jumps up and throws a punch at a man wearing gloves and dressed in all black. The first man is knocked to the ground in a matter of seconds. 

The fighters, both male and female who appeared to be Indigenous,  look as young as 13 and are surrounded by a large group of onlookers, cheering the them on, whilst filming the horrific 'event'.

The video was reportedly placed on a Facebook page, according to ninemsn.com.au and has since been removed from the social networking site. 

Queensland police said violent behaviour is not tolerated and the video is currently under investigation. 

'It is understood that some of the incidents depicted in the video are more than six months old and were not reported to police at the time.

'It is often the case that police are unaware of these incidents until they are later uploaded onto social media outlets.'

This year other videos of violent fighting videos in Indigenous communities surfaced on a Facebook page, promoting street fights in towns identified as Toomelah, Moranbah, Cairns and Toowoomba,SBS reports.
