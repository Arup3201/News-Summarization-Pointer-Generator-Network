Top football prospect Alex Collins, 18, has finally signed for the Arkansas Razorbacks a day after his mom walked out on a ceremony with the letter of intent papers that she was required to sign in order to make his dream a reality.

As an adult under 21 years, Collins required a National Letter of Intent (NLI) signed by a parent or legal guardian in order for his contract with Arkansas 
to be considered valid.

His mom, Andrea McDonald, refused to sign the NLI because she didn't want her son moving to Arkansas, some 2,478km from the family home in 
Plantation, a suburb of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Her preferred destination for her son was the University of Miami, just 44km away.

Alex officially signed for the University of Arkansas team on Thursday lunchtime after his father Johnny Collins signed his NLI.

Johnny Collins said his son called 
him Wednesday afternoon, telling him his mother wouldn't sign his 
letter and he was 'happy to help' his son.

'I was upset that he was upset,' said Johnny Collins, who isn't married to his son's mother. 'And I'm glad it's over with.'

Alex Collins told a press conference that he was happy to have finally signed.

'I didn’t think about going anywhere else 
because I had my mind set this is where I wanted to go,' he said. 'I just talked to
my mom and let her know. I explained myself and we got a better 
understanding.'

Despite his insistence that she 
supports his decision Andrea McDonald, who didn't attend Thursday's ceremony, is understood to have hired legal representation concerning her son's NLI and college choice. She will be represented by Jack Paris of the Cochran Firm.

'Alex's family has been overwhelmed with media inquiries regarding their impending decision,' said Paris in a statement.

'They want to make a clean choice 
that is free of any outside influences. This is a very tough decision 
and they are weighing their options very carefully.'

Collins, one of the most sought-after running backs in the country, was forced to cancel his signing ceremony on Wednesday because his mom is unhappy that he has chosen a university thousands of kilometers from home.

He has publicly expressed his desire 
to go to Arkansas, some 2,478km from Plantation, but his mom has made it
known that she would prefer him to stay closer to home and sign with 
the University of Miami, just 44km away.

Ms.
McDonald was expected to sign her son’s papers on Wednesday morning, 
but minutes before the ceremony at South Plantation High School she abruptly left.

‘She said she didn’t want to sign,’ Collins’ older brother Johnny, 20, told The Miami Herald. ‘I know she preferred him to go to UM (Miami). Alex had said he was going to the U, and then all of a sudden he changes his mind. We found out he was going to Arkansas on TV.’

Johnny said he and his older sister 
accompanied their mother, a single parent, to South Plantation High at 
about 10:45 a.m. for the would-be signing ceremony, and that the 
siblings were told to wait in the room with ‘the public and media’ while
she and Alex went into a separate room. But ‘a couple minutes later,’ 
Johnny said, his mother left.

‘She’s having anxiety,’ Johnny said.

The National Letter of Intent, according to the official website, is a binding agreement between a prospective student-athlete and an NLI member institution.

'If you are under the age of 21, regardless of marital status, your parent or legal guardian must sign the NLI in order for it to be considered valid,’’ the website states.

Collins ran 1,275 yards and 14 touchdowns on 155 carries as a senior and helped lead South Plantation to a district title

Late Wednesday Collins told NBC6 that he still intends to sign with Arkansas, although he did not address the parental issue.

'It's been stressful but I feel a lot of relief after I made my 
decision,' he tod NBC 6. 'I feel like everything will get easier now. I 
just have to sign that paper, and then everything else will be easy.'

The 5-foot-11, 200-pound Collins, 
gave a verbal commitment to Arkansas on Monday, choosing the Razorbacks 
over Miami, Florida, Wisconsin and Florida State.

He ran for 1,275 yards and 14 touchdowns on 155 carries as a senior and helped lead South Plantation High School to a district title.
