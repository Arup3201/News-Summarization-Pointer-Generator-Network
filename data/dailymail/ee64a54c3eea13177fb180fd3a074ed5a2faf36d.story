Police have been forced to step in and move foolhardy weather-watchers away from the shore amidst fears that people were endangering themselves by getting too close to giant waves during a day of stormy weather.

A family in Cornwall narrowly escaped being swept into the sea when a 20ft wave washed over them as they were walking along a sea wall.

And a group of young men in Shoreham, Sussex risked their lives by playing around on the narrow ledge of a wall as waves crashed around them.

Danger: A young family walking along a sea wall in Mullion Cove, Cornwall during stormy weather yesterday

Wave: The family were suddenly engulfed by a huge surge which crashed over the top of the wall

The Environment Agency criticised people who lined the shore to watch the waves battering Britain's coasts.

'Clearly
 it is dangerous to get too close to these waves,' a spokesman said. 
'There is colossal power in these waves that can knock people off their 
feet.

'We would advice 
people to keep well away. There have already been two fatalities this 
year already and we urge you not to add to those statistics.'

At
 Mullion Cove in Cornwall, which is almost the southernmost point in all
 of Britain, a father, mother and three young children were photographed
 walking along a barrier when a 20ft wave came over the top of the wall,
 drenching all four members of the family.

The incident could have
 been extremely dangerous for the parents and children, who were in the 
middle of a narrow walkway and were nearly swept into the sea.

Aftermath: The family looked completely drenched after the wave came crashing down over them

Recovering: The parents and children were hit by another smaller on a different part of the wall

But thankfully, the unidentified family appeared to be unhurt - even if they were left extremely wet.

Onlooker
 Phil Rodda, who was standing at a safe distance during the incident 
yesterday , said he was shocked to see the family exposing themselves to
 potential danger.

'We 
could see the young family, a man and a woman with three or four kids in
 all,' he said. 'The man was lifting his little girl up against the 
railings so she could get a better view.

'Suddenly
 this huge wave came crashing over the harbour wall and knocked the dad 
off his feet. He fell back onto the ground, still clutching the girl - 
they were very close to being swept away.

'The mother then ran over and grabbed the girl before they traipsed off looking drenched and rather sheepish.

'Anyone
 who knows the sea around here knows what it's capable off so I'm 
guessing they were from out of town. It was a ludicrous thing to do and 
incredibly dangerous.'

Reckless: Three young men were seen standing on top of a sea wall in Shoreham, Sussex today

Lucky: The boys were fortunate not to have been knocked off as huge waves broke around them

The incident happened in the same harbour where a holidaying couple were swept to their deaths during a seaside stroll in 2007.

Elsewhere,
 sightseers who flocked to the coast to witness the dramatic scenes were
 ordered to move by officials amidst fears they were putting their own 
lives at risk.

Carmarthenshire County Council called
 in the police to move on sightseers who turned out in large numbers at 
Burry Port, in south-west Wales.

The
 coastal town, which sits on a tidal estuary, was lashed by huge waves 
and winds of more than 70mph during the morning high tide.

Sightseers
 were using a car park close to the town's RNLI station which was a 
potentially dangerous area because of debris being thrown out of the 
sea.

Warnings: Police and environmental officials are urging members of the public to stay away from the coast

Crashing: Many people went to the shore to see the dramatic scenes for themselves

A total of 21 severe flood warnings - suggesting conditions so bad that lives will be at risk - are in place across Britain.

Areas
 are already under water but South Wales and North Devon are set to be 
worst hit tonight with 10.4m high tides hitting Porthcawl and 9.7m 
hitting Ilfracombe at around 7.30pm.

Waves
 of 30ft have been consistently hitting the coast since the 
pre-Christmas storms. The waves are pushed in from the South Atlantic 
and crash straight into the West Country off the Atlantic Ocean.

Residents of low-lying areas have been warned to pack their bags because the violent Atlantic storm is expected to overwhelm large parts of the nationâ€™s battered flood defences.

The Environment Agency has issued 21 severe flood warnings for the Midlands and western areas, warning residents of danger to life.

Some 437 less severe alerts were issued for other parts of the country as forecasters warned of winds of up to 60mph and days of rain.
