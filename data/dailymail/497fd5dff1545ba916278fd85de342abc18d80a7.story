West Ham have asked about Lorient defender Lamine Kone as manager Sam Allardyce looks to bolster his squad ahead of the next Premier League season.

The 25-year-old centre-back is valued at about £5million and has played for France at every level from U17 to U20.

Kone was linked with a move to the Premier League last year, with Sunderland the interested party on that occasion.

This time, though, Big Sam is the man hunting for the experienced defender.

Kone made 74 appearances during his four-year spell at Chateauroux, before joining Lorient, where he has played 50 games in Ligue 1.
