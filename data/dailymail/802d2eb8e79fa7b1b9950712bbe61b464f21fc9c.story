They used to like a statement at Rangers. Barely a day went by without one. Former director Dave King would say something. Rangers would fire back. Rangers would put out an email. King would respond.

It peaked one night in April. At 10pm, King put out some words accusing chief executive Graham Wallace of deceiving shareholders over the club’s finances at the AGM. At 11pm, chairman David Somers responded. By midnight, the rest of us were losing the will to live.

Eventually, the lengthy, incessant missives dried up following the arrival of PR consultant Paul Tyrrell, the former Liverpool and Everton PR communications director.

Responding to every accusation cheapens the argument. It saps what’s left of the club’s dignity.

The elusive Rafat Rizvi could be further involved at Ibrox than is widely acknowledged

But the problem is this. A picture of powerbroker Sandy Easdale leaving a Glasgow restaurant with Rafat Rizvi this week was disturbing and worrying. It cried out for a bold, unambiguous statement. An assurance to supporters that Rizvi had nothing to do with Rangers and that the club wanted no dealings with a convicted fraudster sought by Interpol.

What came instead was, frankly, unbelievable. The public relations equivalent of the dog ate my homework.

A UK subject, Rizvi is wanted on charges of money laundering, corruption and fraud against the Bank Century.

Sentenced by Indonesian courts in absentia to 15 years in prison, he ducks justice by taking refuge in nations with no extradition treaty with Jakarta. Britain is one of them.

So it was, then, that he walked, unencumbered, through the streets of Glasgow side by side with Sandy Easdale minutes after a lunch appointment with Malaysian businessmen who may or may not have been here to invest in Rangers.

This was surprising for a number of reasons. In an interview with STV last December, Greenock bus tycoon Easdale said on camera he ‘had not had any dealings’ with Rizvi. It may have been true then. It’s not now.

From early on Tuesday, rumours swirled around Glasgow of a fleet of black Range Rovers filled with Malaysian businessmen filing into Murray Park followed by suggestions the mysterious, shady figure of Rizvi was in town.

When Sportsmail made a check call, a Rangers official denied both claims.

There would be a vague acknowledgement later that night that the Malaysians had been in town on a youth development fact-finding mission. It was a non-story, went the party line, nothing to worry about.

Until, that is, the pictures of Easdale, Rizvi and the Malaysians the next day told a very different, damaging tale.

‘Mr Rafat Rizvi,’ claimed a Rangers statement in explanation, ‘arrived with the Malaysian delegation without our knowledge. He is an advisor to Mr Bin Ahmad.’

On a number of levels, this was mind-blowing stuff. Charles Green claims of a Dallas Cowboys tie-up were more credible.

If a club from the Far East was keen to study best practice in the field of youth-development set-up, would they really choose Rangers as their role models? A club whose conveyor belt can be summed up by the words Lewis and Macleod?

The further notion of Rizvi, a lurking, villainesque figure in this saga, as a youth development middle man is equally improbable. Rizvi’s fortune is estimated at £600million. It’s legitimate to ask why a man of that wealth would be a ‘middle man’ for anyone.

The last time Rizvi’s name came to light was in the court battle between Rangers liquidators BDO and Craig Whyte’s lawyers Collyer Bristow earlier this year.

Judge Mr Justice Newey ruled that furtive tape recordings of former directors Imran Ahmad and Brian Stockbridge openly discussing Rizvi’s role in the club were admissible as evidence.

Ahmad — the latest opportunist to pocket a wedge of the club’s cash — is heard telling Stockbridge ‘there’s no paper trails’ linking Rizvi to Rangers. He adds: ‘There’s no connection.’

This week’s pictures changed all that. It was right there, on the front of a national newspaper. As subtle and menacing as a cybernat zealot with a broken caps lock key.

Rafat Rizvi is not only connected to Rangers. That image created the impression of a man up to his neck in the brown stuff stinking out Ibrox.

Is it really a mere coincidence that, two years after his links with Green and Ahmad were revealed, Rizvi is suddenly back on the scene?

Could it be that this outlaw of Indonesian justice knows far more about the shady, faceless institutional investors behind the Ibrox scenes than anyone lets on?

Or that some of the £5.5million Charles Green used to front up the purchase of the club’s assets in May 2012, might have had Rizvi’s grubby fingerprints on the notes all along?

That’s the clarifying statement people wanted from Rangers this week. The one statement, you suspect, which will never come.
