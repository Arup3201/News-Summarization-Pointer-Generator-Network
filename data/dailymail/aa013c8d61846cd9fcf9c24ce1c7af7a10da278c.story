Jack Wilshere says he is getting back to his best now that he has been able to put together a run of games for Arsenal.

The England midfielder has 'missed a lot of football' over the past few years with injuries, but insists that he now feels good and is fully fit again.

Wilshere has started five of Arsenal's seven Premier League games , including Sunday's 2-0 defeat to Chelsea, and says that fans will now finally get to see the best of him.

The England midfielder was outshone by Cesc Fabregas on Sunday but says he is always looking to improve

'I feel good and I'm always looking to improve, no matter what,' Wilshere told Arsenal's official website. 

'For a player of my age, I've missed a lot of football so I'm just trying to play as much as I can, train as much as I can and I've always said that when I get fully fit you'll see the best of me.

'I said at the start of the season that it was going to take some time to get back to my best. 

'Ever since my first injury, it's always taken a run of games - probably between five and 10 - to get back to my best.

Wilshere insisted Arsenal only needed to take their chances better against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge

The young midfielder has spent too much time sat on the bench with injuries in recent years

'Some players are different, some players come back and are at their best straight away. But some need a run of games and I'm one of those players.'

Wilshere also claimed that Arsenal had been unlucky at Stamford Bridge, failing to take their opportunities in an even game. 

'We've played well but at this level, against the top three in this league, when you're on top you need to make the opportunities count and if you don't then you're going to get punished,' he said.
