The biathalete currently training to compete in the Sochi Winter Olympics thanks to her twin's selfless act giving up her own place on the American team spoke with Today this morning, pledging to do her best for her sister.

Twin sisters Lanny and Tracy Barnes have been competing in the biathalon - the sport that combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting - for the last 15 years. Lanny Barnes appeared via live video from Italy where she was training Thursday while her sister Tracy was in the studio, already back in the U.S.

She told Matt Lauer that she usually knows what her sister is thinking, but was completely shocked when Tracy told her she was passing up her spot on the team so that she could compete instead.

'I want to do my best for Tracy, and I always do better under pressure, so I'm definitely going to push as hard as I can and just fight that much harder for her,' Lanny said.

Lanny initially didn't make the team after falling ill during trials and was the first person cut from the team.

Sister Tracy says she started planning to give up her spot on the team as soon as she figured out her twin was sick.

'I was real disappointed when I heard that she was getting sick,' Tracy said. 'In this sport, you have to be 100 percent to perform at the level that we need to perform at. I kind of knew that things weren’t going to go well for her. It was completely disappointing.'

Tracy decided to go through with her plan when the cuts were announced because she knew that Lanny deserved her position after performing so well throughout the year.

'She's having a great year, and I think when you care enough about someone you're willing to make that kind of sacrifice,’' Tracy said.

So on their ritual post-competition hike, Tracy broke the news to Lanny that she wouldn't take the spot on the team, and that Lanny would be going in her place as the person who placed just below her.

Of course, Lanny put up a fight.

'I was like, "Tracy, there’s no way. This is your spot. You earned this,"' Lanny recalled. 'She was very adamant about me going and she said, "No, I want you to go." It was a very emotional moment for both of us.'

'It just was one of those moments that I think changed my life forever,' Lanny added.

As top competitors in the same sport, the Colorado-based twins have always worried about one person making the team and the other being cut.

Both were able to share their Olympic dream by making the team to compete in the 2006 games in Turin, Italy.

In a beautiful statement that explains her decision, Tracy Barnes said her twin sister Lanny deserved a second chance after failing to make the Winter Olympics team. Tracy said her sibling was having a 'stellar season' before falling ill and that she is honored to be able to help her

But for the following 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, just Lanny made the cut.

As Lanny's twin as well as best friend, Tracy may have seen that her sister had more passion to compete than her.

The twins' mother, Deb Barnes, told The Durango Herald that Tracy's motivation to go to the Olympics had waned in the last year.

She is married to Durango Nordic race team coach Gary Colliander, and her mother said they haven't been able to spend much time together because of her heavy travel schedule.

'Tracy is just ready for other things,' Deb Barnes told the newspaper.
