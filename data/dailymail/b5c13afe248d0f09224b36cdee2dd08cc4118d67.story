A little girl is heading home for Christmas for the first time after spending the first two and a half years of her life in hospital fighting a life-threatening illness.

Adalynn Willett was born with her liver and intestines outside of her body, a condition known as Omphalocele.

She has undergone 28 surgeries - one for each month she has been alive - at Cook Children's Medical Center, Texas.

First steps: Two-year old Adalynn Willett leaves the Texas hospital for the first time since she was born 850 days ago after battling a rare condition where her liver and intestines were outside her body

Going home: Adalynn, with her parents Serafina Sevallos and Bryan Willett prepares to head to the family's home in Abilene for the first time

She took her first steps outside the hospital on Tuesday with her family by her side and headed home to Abilene.

The child's mother Serafina Sevallos was overcome with emotion as she carried her daughter in a purple, sparkly dress from the ward.

When doctors discovered Adalynn's 
condition while she was still in the womb, they estimated she may have to 
spend the first few months of her life in hospital.

The birth defect causes the baby's abdominal organs to stick out of the belly button.

Between 25-40 per cent of babies with an Omphalocele have other defects including genetic and heart problems.

Once the child is born, surgery takes place to repair the Omphalocele. The organs are covered with a man-made pouch which is stitched in place and they are gradually pushed back into the body. 

Children are expected to make a full recovery following the procedure.

Giant omphalocele is extremely rare and affects one in every 10,000 babies.

Adalynn has had her heart stop twice in the course of her treatment and battled many infections.

Although the toddler still has a way to go, she is expected to lead a normal life.

At the moment, she as a tracheotomy to offset pressure put on her lungs by her intestines.

She will continue to be fed using a feeding tube until next spring after the precarious flu season has passed and her risk of infection is lower.

Her team of doctors are optimistic that little Adalynn will not require long-term care.

Her father Bryan Willett told WFAA: 'I always hoped for it, but I never thought this day would come. It is a very exciting day.'

Full of joy: Adalynn is set to spend her first Christmas at home with her mom and dad

Smiling through: Adalynn has endured 28 surgeries to fix her condition - almost one for each month she has been alive

On the mend: Doctors are hopeful that Adalynn will not need lifelong care after undergoing such extensive procedures in early life
