Thirteen Rutgers University faculty members are demanding the resignation of university President Robert Barchi over his response to a video showing basketball coach Mike Rice hitting, shoving and berating his players with anti-gay slurs.

The professors' letter to the school's trustees and Board of Governors calls for Barchi's job. It says his handling of the 'homophobic and misogynist abuse' was inexcusable.

Rice was fired Wednesday, a day after the video surfaced publicly. Barchi approved a three-game suspension for Rice last year after the school first learned of the video.

Also on Wednesday, former Rutger's 
basketball player Tyree Graham went on 'Piers Morgan Live' to defend his
former coach's abusive behavior.

Graham said Rice is 'very passionate' and he was really only 'joking' when he shouted homophobic epithets at his players.

'If you were in the gym at the time 
and really around Coach Rice and knew Coach Rice as a person like I know
him as, you would understand ... that he was just trying to motivate 
you,' Graham said. 'We all have different ways of motivation.'

While he steadfastly defended Rice, Graham did admit that players felt he often went too far with his forms of 'motivation.'

If players stood up to him on the 
court, Graham said, 'he would get in a heated argument.' But afterwards,
he would  calm down and pull the player aside to tell him he didn't 
mean anything against him personally, but that he was just trying to be 
motivational.

Graham said Rice's tactics were effective on him.

'He motivated me on an off the court,' Graham said, noting that Rice pushed him to make better grades in school.

Meanwhile Tim Pernetti, the Rutgers athletic 
director who yesterday defended his decision to suspend and not fire Rice, has admitted that he made the wrong move.

Pernetti said: 'I am responsible for 
the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of Coach Rice.

'Dismissal and 
corrective action were debated in December and I thought it was in the 
best interest of everyone to rehabilitate, but I was wrong.'

He added: 'Moving forward, I will work to regain the trust of the Rutgers community.'

Fleeing: Rice is seen leaving his home in Little Silver, N.J. Wednesday after he was fired

Driven from his home: With political and social pressure mounting, the former coach left his home - which was surrounded by media - with his dog and a bag of belongings

Admission: Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice, has admitted that his decision to suspend Rice in December - and not fire him - was the wrong move

Pernetti was given a copy of the tape by a former employee in November and, after an independent investigator was hired to review it, Rice was suspended for three games, fined $75,000 and ordered to attend anger management classes. University President Robert Barchi agreed to the penalty.

Pernetti initially said Tuesday he and Barchi viewed the video in December. The president issued a statement Wednesday, saying he didn't see it until Tuesday and then moved to fire the 44-year-old coach for repeated abusive conduct. Through a school spokesman, Pernetti backed up his president and said Barchi did not view the video until this week.

'Yesterday, I personally reviewed the video evidence, which shows a chronic and pervasive pattern of disturbing behavior,' Barchi said in a statement. 'I have now reached the conclusion that Coach Rice cannot continue to serve effectively in a position that demands the highest levels of leadership, responsibility and public accountability. He cannot continue to coach at Rutgers University.'

Speaking to WABC-TV outside his home today, Rice said there is 'no excuse' for his behavior in the video, and apologized for his actions.

He told the station: I've let so many people down, my players, my administration, Rutgers University, the fans, my family - who's sitting in their house, just huddled around because of the fact that their father was an embarrassment to them. It's troubling, but I hope at some time, maybe I'll try and explain it.

'But right now, there's no explanation for what's on those films, because there's no excuse for it. I was wrong. And I want to tell everybody who's believed in me that I'm deeply sorry for the pain and the hardship that I've caused.'

Facing the media: Rice spoke to reporters outside his New Jersey home on Wednesday after it was learned that he had been fired

Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You're a f***ing f****t!' 

The clip, obtained and released by ESPN yesterday, shows a number of disturbing and violent actions taken by Rice toward his players during team practices.

At one point on the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You’re a f***ing f****t!'

And his rants were not just limited to the verbal.

The footage shows Rice grabbing, kicking and shoving players - and even hurling basketballs at them.

Fired: Rice was let go by Rutgers amid a public outcry surrounding the release of the video yesterday

The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012.

Murdock, a former college standout 
who played with teams like the Utah Jazz and 
New Jersey (now Brooklyn) Nets, was hired by Rutgers in 2010 as director
of player development.

He told ESPN that it wasn't long before he reported Rice's aggressive behavior to Pernetti.

But Rice was not disciplined until Murdock showed him the footage in November.

A month later, Rice was suspended for three games without pay and fined.

Rice returned to his duties as head coach in a game on January 2 against Syracuse.

Pernetti said in an interview with 
ESPN yesterday that he issued the suspension and the fine after he was shown the 
tape and conducted an investigation into the matter.

He said that Rice was penalized appropriately for a 'first offense.'

Pernetti nor director of athletic communications Kevin Lorincz returned messages from MailOnline for comment.

When asked about the suspension at the time, Pernetti said: 'I was made aware of some things within the last couple of weeks. We commenced a thorough, lengthy and fair investigation and this was the result of that investigation.

'There was obviously some things that are not to the Rutgers' standard that we evaluated and decided upon.'

Criticism: As the clip has spread, it has drawn a rebuke from many on social media, including NBA superstar LeBron James

After ESPN aired the videotape yesterday, a flood of anger swirled on social media with many lambasting Rutgers, including NBA superstar LeBron James and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie.

After the decision was announced today, Gov Christie posted a series of tweets supporting the decision to fire Rice.

He said: 'It was the right & necessary action to take in light of the conduct displayed on the videotape.'

Murdock stayed with the team for two years until July 2012, when his contract was not renewed.

Murdock claims he was fired after he reported Rice’s antics, a claim Pernetti denies.

His attorney Raj Gadhok told ESPN: 'Mr Murdock was terminated for having complained of and reported illegal conduct by Mike Rice. As a result, his employment was terminated by Rutgers University.

'That’s unlawful in the state of New Jersey and Eric intends to pursue legal action for his wrongful termination, which he university and its representatives had been aware of for some time now.'
