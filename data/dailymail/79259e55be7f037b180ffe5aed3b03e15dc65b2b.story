NFL interest in the United Kingdom continues to grow rapidly but if this infographic - released by the Atlanta Falcons - is anything to go by, the NFL still has a lot to learn about its transatlantic cousins.

The Falcons arrived in London earlier this week ahead of Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions at Wembley, but they obviously didn't follow the map on their own graphic as it has London positioned in eastern Spain.

If misinforming their fans about where the team were actually going isn't bad enough, the graphic also states that the team and staff will take three planes to London, when in fact it is only two.

Atlanta Falcons attempted to inform fans about their trip to London with this infographic, but failed miserably

The graphic was originally tweeted by the Falcons but was soon removed and replaced with the correct information.

But not before the mistake-laden graphic was distributed across Twitter, attracting a barrage of comments from humoured followers.

Atlanta trained ahead of the match on Wednesday  at Arsenal's London Colney training ground.

Sunday's game is the second of three NFL matches to be played at Wembley in 2014,after the Miami Dolphins comfortably beat the Oakland Raiders 38-14 in September.

London is set to play host to the Dallas Cowboys when they face the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday November 9.
