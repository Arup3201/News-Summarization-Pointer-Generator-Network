Rangers have launched an immediate investigation after goalkeeper Steve Simonsen was hit with two SFA charges for alleged breaches of gambling rules.

The Englishman is said to have put money on 55 matches, although none involved Rangers, and the SFA insist there is no suggestion the Ibrox player was involved in any of the matches he is accused of betting on.

The 35-year-old is accused of placing bets on 18 matches between January 15 and June 22 last year as well as a further 37 games between September 6 last year and January 13 this year.

A principal hearing date has been set for Thursday, February 12, with the former Dundee man having until January 29 to respond to the charges.

Simonsen is the third Scottish-based player to have been hit with such charges in recent times.

In September 2013, Ibrox team-mate Ian Black was fined £7,500 and given a 10-game ban, seven of which were suspended, after admitting gambling on over 160 games over a seven-year period. Three of those matches included betting against his own team to win.

Despite the anger of many Rangers fans at that revelation, the former Hearts midfielder continued to play under Ally McCoist.

Last season, then Ayr United forward Michael Moffat was handed a six-match ban, reduced to four on appeal, after being found guilty of betting on 150 games between February 19, 2012 and September 1, 2013. He has since signed for Dunfermline.

Simonsen, who counts Tranmere, Everton and Stoke among his former clubs, is enjoying an extended run in the Rangers team with first-choice Cammy Bell currently sidelined through injury.

A Rangers spokesman said that ‘the club is aware of the SFA’s notice of complaint and is currently investigating the matter’.

The keeper has been charged under SFA rules 31 and 33.

Disciplinary Rule 33 (from season 2013/14) states: No club, official, Team Official or other member of Team Staff, player, match official or other person under the jurisdiction of the Scottish FA shall bet in any way on a football match (except authorised and registered football pools).

Disciplinary Rule 31 (2014/15) states: No club, official, Team Official or other member of Team Staff, player, match official or other person under the jurisdiction of the Scottish FA shall gamble in any way on a football match. Any such club or person to have engaged in gambling of any description on football shall be in breach of this rule.

While players in England are allowed to bet on football competitions they are not involved in, the SFA has a zero tolerance rule that bans players in Scotland from betting on any matches.

In other developments at Ibrox it emerged the Rangers Supporters Trust has announced it has now passed the one-million share threshold after buying up another chunk of shares in the club.
