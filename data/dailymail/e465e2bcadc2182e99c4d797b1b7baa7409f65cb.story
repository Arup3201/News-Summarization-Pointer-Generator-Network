Three trips to the United States saw Alex Salmond stay in some of the country's most luxurious hotels while racking up a bill of more than £20,000 at taxpayers' expense.

The Scottish Government has finally published details of the First Minister's foreign jaunts following an eight-month battle over the data. 

Mr Salmond's travel and subsistence bill for a visit to Chicago for the Ryder Cup in 2012 cost £7,046. 

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, pictured in Hollywood in 2012, has been criticised for hisglobe-trotting at taxpayers' expense

In 2012, Mr Salmond donned his tartan trousers to attend the Hollywood premier of Disney film Brave

He stayed in a suite in the five-star Peninsula Hotel, popular with celebrities such as Brad Pitt, which included a guest powder room, living room, a dressing area, three TVs, a video games console, a surround-sound stereo system and a marble bathroom.

Mr Salmond would have been treated to panoramic views of Michigan Avenue, one of Chicago's main thoroughfares, and the city's historic Water Tower Park.

The SNP leader, who was accompanied by three officials, has refused to disclose how much he spent on this weeklong jaunt, dismissing criticism as 'ridiculous frippery'. 

But the majority of the 'Team Scotland' delegation in the US at the same time stayed in a more modest hotel near the Medinah golf course, which charges £60 for a room. The entire trip cost taxpayers nearly £500,000.

The new figures also show that Mr Salmond's bill for a four-day trip to California in 2012 was £8,197, where he attended the movie premiere of the Disney/ Pixar film Brave. He took three officials with him.

In April last year, the First Minister took part in New York's Scotland Week for the first time in five years, and his bill came to £4,999. 

Once again travelling with three officials, he delivered speeches which covered his push for independence.

While in the US, it is thought Mr Salmond stayed at the Algonquin Hotel in midtown Manhattan, which offers rooms for up to £400 a night and is officially designated a historic landmark.

But the Scottish Government repeatedly refuses to confirm where the First Minister stays when abroad and Freedom of Information (FOI) requests asking for costs to be published have gone unanswered. 

In November, the Tories used the FOI Act to request a breakdown of all ministerial overseas visits between February 2012 and October 2013, and complained to the Scottish Information Commissioner last month when the data had still not been released.

Finally, it was disclosed yesterday that the SNP administration spent almost £219,000 on overseas trips for ministers and officials in the past three years. Mr Salmond's bill included £7,725 for a trip to China in November.

Tory chief whip John Lamont accused the Scottish Government of being 'secretive' about the spending.

He said: 'The sheer expense of some trips has to be questioned, especially with so many officials accompanying people like the First Minister abroad.

'The fact the Scottish Government took several months to publish will also arouse suspicion. If ministers did not have something to hide, why were they so secretive?'

Scottish Labour business manager Paul Martin said: 'When many families are having to forego their summer holiday because money is tight, it is clear Alex Salmond thinks there is nothing wrong with spending our money on luxury hotels.

'Given the bill he is running up, Alex Salmond seems more interested in having a good time than winning jobs and investment.' 

But a spokesman for Finance Secretary John Swinney said: 'This is the height of hypocrisy from a Tory Party which, in government at Westminster, thinks nothing of spending £13million in a year on flights and hotels for the Foreign Office.

'Meanwhile, the [UK Government's] Scotland Office's bill for domestic flights has almost doubled in just two years to more than £130,000.

'And the Tory Treasury are still hiding polling on the referendum, despite spending £300,000 of taxpayers' cash on it.'
