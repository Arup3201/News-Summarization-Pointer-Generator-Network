A man was electrocuted after scaling an electricity pylon and performing acrobatics in a drug-induced stunt.

The man, named only as Miguel, swung onto one of high-voltage cables causing a massive explosion before plummetingÂ  to the ground in Santiago, Chile.

The moment was caught in a dramatic amateur video filmed by one of the onlookers.

Killed: A man was horrifically executed after scaling an electricity pylon and performing acrobatics in a drug-induced stunt

Horrified locals called police to the Lo Prado area of the Chilean capital yesterday afternoon after seeing the man 'playing around' on the pylon near his home, according to reports.

A crowd gathered as he climbed to the top at around 4pm before balancing on the beams and swinging back and forth inches away from the live wires.

Firefighters tried for 30 minutes to coax him down and placed an airbag at the foot of the pylon to catch him if he fell.

Not known what he is doing up there, but it looks like a stunt that has gone wrong in Chile

Fall: His legs touched one of the cables killing him instantly and causing an explosion which reportedly set fire to two nearby houses

Neighbours said that it wasn't the first time the man had performed dangerous acrobatics on pylons in the area after becoming high on drugs.

But this time his legs touched one of the cables, killing him instantly and causing an explosion which set fire to two nearby houses.

The flames were quickly put out but more than 500 homes were left without electricity.
