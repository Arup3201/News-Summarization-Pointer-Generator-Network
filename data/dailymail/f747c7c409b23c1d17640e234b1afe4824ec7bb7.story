A distraught mother was throttled in her own home by her neighbour's father after a long-running argument - over a fence.

Ian Graham, 59, of Sunderland, charged round to Angela Forster's home and launched his attack, grabbing her neck and squeezing, while screaming in her face, a court heard.

The families, who used to be friends, fell out in August 2012, after mother-of-two Ms Forster, 46, heightened her back fence, apparently upsetting her neighbours.

Sunderland Magistrates' Court heard that trouble between the pair escalated further over arguments about car parking, culminating in the attack in October last year.

Prosecuting Keith Laidlaw said: 'It was about 4pm and she was at home in the kitchen, when she heard a few loud bangs at the door.

'She opened the door and saw the defendant standing on the doorstep. Without any warning, he grabbed her by the throat and began to squeeze slightly.

'He began to scream at her, saying "You have ruined my daughter's life".'

The court heard school cook Angela, who has two children, aged 11 and 17, has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder since the attack.

Speaking outside court, Angela, who has not been back to work since and is on medication, said: 'We used to have a really good relationship, as her son is in the same class as my daughter.

'I didnt even cry at first. I could not believe that someone had come into my home and done something like that. It was horrible.'

Defending, Gerry Armstrong, told the court Graham ran his own business and had never been in trouble before.

Graham denied assault but was found guilty after trial. He was sentenced to a one-year community order with 160 hours of unpaid work, and told to pay Â£50 in compensation and Â£450 costs.
