Bill Gates' wife Melinda and 13-year-old son Rory where also at the show to cheer on the teenager.

The family watched intently as Jennifer took part in the Winter Equestrian Festival which runs until April 1. It hosts 5,000 horses and 2,800 riders from 49 states and 30 countries.

Miss Gates was competing in one of the children's jumping divisions, Equestrian Sport Productions spokeswoman Jennifer Wood confirmed to MailOnline.

It costs $45 each time to enter a division and prize money is between $1,500 - $2,000.

Her father, America's richest man, was said to have rented a 7,300 sq ft house with eight bedrooms and its own equestrian facilities for $600,000. The property in Wellington, Florida is worth $12.9million.

Although Candice Cerro, from 
move.com, could not confirm to MailOnline that the Gates family rented 
the home, she said that the listing for the property was no longer on 
the market.

Gates then leased four, elite jumping
 horses for $50,000 to $75,000 each for the girl to ride. Another 
$50,000 has been forked out on stables along with hiring the best 
trainers.

On top of this, there have been three 
private jet trips to ferry the family back and forth to Washington 
State, where their main residence sits on the edge of Lake Washington in
 Medina.

The Florida home has eight bedrooms, a barn, stables and horse training area and a guarded access road, according to Gawker. It also boasts a wine cellar and media room.

The Microsoft founder reportedly has an option to buy the house at the end of the lease.

While his
 daughter was competing in the prestigious event, the Microsoft boss and
 philanthropist was at times engrossed in The Quest - a book about 
global energy and its changing role in the economy and political sphere.
