Foreign nationals arrested by the police – including EU citizens – will be deported even if they are not convicted of any crime.

The move follows a pilot scheme in London under which 2,091 migrants have been kicked out, including more than 100 from Poland and Romania.

It can be hard to remove EU nationals because of free movement rules, but the crackdown will use European law stating that if people want to remain here, they must be exercising their right to work or be self-sufficient. This could be used to tackle groups such as the notorious Park Lane beggars, a group largely from Eastern European countries such as Romania which has haunted the central London area.

Now, police who arrest EU nationals for offences such as begging will hand their cases over to immigration officials. They will then be kicked out and barred from returning for at least a year.

There will be border guards in police stations across England and Wales to check the immigration status of those arrested. In some cases, they will be joined by officers from Romania and Poland to spot known offenders from overseas.

Anybody who is wanted abroad or is here illegally will be fast-tracked for removal under the Operation Nexus project.

On top of this, it will also target suspected criminals against whom there is insufficient evidence for a prosecution.

James Brokenshire: 'Foreign nationals who break the laws of this country have nowhere to hide'

It will use intelligence gathered by police to make a case that they should be booted out of Britain because their presence is not in the public interest.

In London, border guards have recently removed 44 Polish nationals, 64 Romanians and two Bulgarians, all either suspected offenders or foreign criminals.

A further 142 European Union nationals, or those with EU rights, are being investigated with a view to removal.

Immigration minister James Brokenshire said: ‘The success of Operation Nexus shows that foreign nationals who break the laws of this country have nowhere to hide.’

Police and border guards began the London pilot in September 2012 after it emerged that a quarter of suspected offenders arrested in the capital were foreign nationals.

Immigration officials in police stations can put an immediate block on any applications suspects may have lodged for British citizenship. Their cases are then fast-tracked.

Evidence of criminality – including convictions before their latest arrest – will be used against them in immigration tribunals.

The extension of Operation Nexus nationwide is part of the Government’s organised crime strategy.Criminals removed under the London pilot included Frezel Poku, a Ghanaian national and convicted robber arrested while driving a stolen vehicle. Immigration officers used a police dossier to prove he was a high-risk individual.

Pro-migrant groups have criticised Operation Nexus, saying it will damage community relations.
