West Bromwich Albion have appointed Alan Irvine as their shock new boss and successor to Pepe Mel.

After failing to agree a deal with former Spurs boss Tim Sherwood, the Baggies have moved for the former Preston and Sheffield Wednesday manager.

Irvine leaves his post at Everton where he has been academy chief since 2011.

The 55-year-old Scot has signed a rolling 12-month contract at the Hawthorns.

Irvine will bring Rob Kelly to work as his assistant manager alongside Keith Downing, while Dean Kiely will remain as goalkeeper coach.

He was considered a strong contender for the role five years ago when it was handed to Roberto Di Matteo but now gets the nod from chairman Jeremy Peace after a second round of interviews.

The appointment ends a month-long hunt for the replacement of Mel, who was sacked after the Baggies finished just one place and three points from the relegation places.

Fan reactions have been less than favourable on social media, ranging from indifference to outrage,  with some fans already demanding refunds for season tickets. Other suggest the West Brom board has gone for the cheap option after failing to come to terms with Sherwood.

The Baggies confirmed the decision on Twitter: 'Albion delighted to announce Alan Irvine will be appointed as their new Head Coach. He has agreed a 12-month rolling contract.

'Irvine will complete his move to The Hawthorns once he has officially signed off from his current role as Everton’s academy manager.'

West Brom technical director Terry Burton said: 'I'm delighted we have been able to secure the services of Alan and Rob.'

'With the support of Keith and Dean, we firmly believe we have put in place the right coaching team to move the club forward.'

Stepping up: Irvine will take over at West Brom once the paperwork is finalised for his Everton departure

While never holding a top-flight managerial role, Irvine has Premier League coaching experience after being David Moyes' assistant at Everton, during which time they managed to finish three out of five seasons in the top seven.

'From the outset, we decided to pursue candidates who are renowned for their coaching ability and Alan was very much at the forefront of our thoughts because of his achievements in the Premier League and the high regard he is held within the game,' Burton continued on West Brom's official website.

'In the end it came down to two outstanding candidates for the role. But, following a detailed recruitment process, we decided Alan and the team around him are best suited to tackle the challenges we face in the Barclays Premier League.

'He has a vast knowledge from grassroots up thanks to the roles he has performed during his decades in the game and knows what it takes through good and testing times.'
