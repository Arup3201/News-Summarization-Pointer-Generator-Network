VIDEO Koeman handed Saints job

Meanwhile, the Saints have added former 
Liverpool midfielder Sammy Lee to the club's coaching staff after the 
former Liverpool midfielder performed a U-turn and decided against 
taking up the position of assistant manager with Brighton.

The former
 England international had agreed to leave his role as the head of 
academy coaching and development at Bolton to take up the position with 
their Championship rivals following the appointment of Sami Hyypia as 
boss.

However, the 55-year-old has instead taken up a coaching position at St Mary's.

Brighton
 chief executive Paul Barber said: 'It is extremely disappointing for 
the club, Sami Hyypia and those of us who worked hard to bring him here,
 that Sammy Lee has now reversed his decision after agreeing to become 
assistant manager.

'Nobody
 at our club or Bolton was aware of any interest from Southampton until 
several hours after we announced Sammy's appointment as our assistant 
manager. It's certainly not a situation any of us have come across 
before.

'Having
 already agreed his contract and terms with us to start work on Monday, 
we could have insisted on Sammy serving a notice period but we all feel 
it would have been counter-productive to do so - and while it's 
incredibly frustrating for us we wish Sammy well.

U-turn: Sammy Lee has joined Southampton having initially agreed to join Championship side Brighton

'Our
 focus now is on working with Sami to help him recruit his assistant - 
while also supporting him to bring in the players he needs to improve 
the squad for the new season.'

Lee
 apologised for the situation on the Seagulls' official website as he 
said: 'I was thrilled to be offered the job at Brighton and I was 
excited at the prospect of working with Sami Hyypia again.

'But, totally unexpectedly, I have been given an opportunity to work in the Premier League.

'I
 fully appreciate that this is not an ideal set of circumstances and I 
am very sorry for the inconvenience and any embarrassment my change of 
mind, after the announcement was made, has caused.

'However,
 at this stage of my coaching career, the opportunity to work again at 
the very top level of English football was not something I felt I could 
turn down.

'I hope everyone at Brighton can understand the difficult predicament I found myself in and why I made this decision.'
