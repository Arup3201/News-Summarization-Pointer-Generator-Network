Following fashion slavishly has never been my thing.

But since my daughter Katie told me, about 15 years ago, that I 'must stop wearing those ridiculous jeans' (high-waisted, bit baggy, tapering to the ankle - you know the kind of thing) I've tried to at least be influenced by current trends.

Katie put me into a pair of straight-legged Levis and I was a new woman; or at least the old one refurbished, like a second-hand armchair.

There have been many fashions over the past decade or so that have been only too easy and flattering to adopt, from flared trousers to skinny jeans.

But there comes a point, once over a certain age, when you have to tread very carefully when adopting the latest Big Thing In Fashion.

City shorts are a case in point. I'm not going to alert you to my legs' many faults, but given they don't even turn a respectable honey colour in the summer, I generally save shorts for holidays and only wear skirts at a comforting mid-knee length.

The thought of sporting short shorts, no matter how tailored, begs several tricky questions.

Will they have a pocket for my bus pass? Will my bare knees turn blue in the supermarket frozen food section? Can any mature woman wear them without looking like mutton dressed as very young, inappropriately frisky lamb?

But though I may be 67, I'm still waiting to wake up feeling like a grown-up, so I decide the only answer is to give them a try . . .

SPORTY TWEED

NOT SO DOTTY

Boucle shorts, £79, and silk top, £74, jigsaw-online.com; sandals, £59.99, zara.com

I felt rather jolly in these and like both the cut and the material - soft and slightly tweedy.

If they were just a couple of inches longer I might, just might, be tempted to wear them.

And as long as you could guarantee me a hot, sunny day - it's not as if you can slip a cardigan over your legs, is it?  

BEST FOR: Skimming your bottom half thanks to the attractive, giving fabric.

WHERE I'D WEAR THEM: On holiday or to a low-key barbecue.

RATING: 3/5

Polka dot shorts, £15, asos.com; top, £49, John Smedley at Fenwick, 020 7629 9161; cream jacket, £175, jaeger.co.uk; tights, £6, and heels, £19.50, marksandspencer.com

The safety of opaque tights cannot only hide many of your leg problems, but turns the wearing of shorts into a layered, funky business.

Smashing, spotty fabric and a cute shape. But without the tights? No way.

BEST FOR: Those with complete confidence in their pins.

WHERE I'D WEAR THEM: To any informal occasion, as long as I'm safely clad in opaques.

RATING: 1/5 (without the tights)

FLASH OF RED

Shorts, £21, asos.com; silk top, £189, Ellie Tahari at Fenwick, 020 7629 9161; jacket, £360, Theory at Fenwick, as before; shoes, £97, hobbs.co.uk

These are too 'look at me' to wear in my children's company. I'm very happy in red or orange of the right shade: this one is uncomfortably brash.

The cut and feel, though, is pretty good. At this price I'd be tempted, if they came in another colour.

BEST FOR: Covering the thighs without looking frumpy.

WHERE I'D WEAR THEM: Topped with a T-shirt on holiday - but not in this colour.

RATING: 2/5

HIGH HEMMED

SLIM CHANCE

Pale blue shorts, £49, jaeger. co.uk; top, £29.99, and jacket, £79.99, zara.com; shoes, £19.50, marksandspencer.com

I love the colour, soft fabric and pretty, full cut, but they're too short. With a couple more inches I might consider them for holidays, a picnic or barbecue.

But teamed with this smart jacket, I look like that game of heads, bodies and legs, with mismatched sections making an uneasy whole. What a shame.

BEST FOR: Someone half my age.

WHERE I'D WEAR THEM: I simply wouldn't!

RATING: 2/5

Shorts, £162, DKNY at my-wardrobe.com; 
peplum top, £99, Max & Co at Fenwick, 020 7629 9161; belt, £39, 
Twiggy at Fenwick, as before; shoes, £139, johnlewis.com

My
favourite. The touch of stretch in the cotton (thanks to a hint of 
Elastane) makes them extremely comfortable and the snug fit is 
flattering. The peplum top means even after a large lunch you can get 
away with the cling over the tummy.

BEST FOR: Flattering the legs, at the perfect length.

WHERE I'D WEAR THEM: Business meetings, lunch with friends.

RATING: 4/5
