Every youngster loves to play in the mud, and it’s no different for these rascally lion cubs. But they’re going to give their mum an extra headache, because three of the four new siblings are ultra-rare white lions... and getting the dirt out of their creamy fur is going to require a lot of licking.

These extraordinary pictures are the first-ever photographs of new-born white lions in the wild. They are found in just one place on Earth, the Greater Timbavati region in South Africa, where just 13 remain — and that total includes these cubs.

It’s serious work, being so young, so rare and so cute. But these boisterous characters have got their paws full exploring and practising their play-fighting. So while the older members of the pride keep a watch for danger, the cubs have fun.

The three snow-white cubs owe their unusual colour to a rare genetic marker that results in a white pelt but pigmented eyes, skin and paws

The new arrivals are part of a pride with six adults, including two fully grown white lionesses. Cape Town photographer Scott Ramsay, 39, who took these pictures, was able to identify the cubs’ mother: ‘She has piercing blue eyes,’ he said, ‘and together with her white coat, she was supremely photogenic.’

But it is not known which male is the father because the cubs are not albinos but owe their remarkable colouring to a genetic twist, which many Timbavati lions carry.

The leucism pigment gene gives them blue or green-grey eyes instead of brown, and a pelt that remains white all their lives. Just like a human family trait, the recessive gene can lie dormant for generations and then reappear — so any of the tawny males could have fathered these cubs. It is even possible for two brown adults to have a litter of white cubs — but only if they are Timbavati lions.

The indigenous Shangaan tribe has known about the white lions for centuries, and their medicine men traditionally believe them to be animal angels. One legend says they were the first creatures to be created by the gods — and when life becomes extinct the roar of the white lions will be the last sound on Earth.

Europeans first discovered them in 1938, though they were not well known until the Seventies, when naturalist Chris McBride published two books. Although the white mutation probably evolved many millennia ago, some conservationists feared white lions could not survive in the wild: their colouring would make it impossible to remain camouflaged while hunting.

Consequently, almost all of the white lions were rounded up and sold to zoos, if they were not killed by big game hunters first. Yet these pictures prove white lions can thrive in the wild.

Tragically, these beautiful creatures do face a deadly threat because of the colour of their pelts — and it comes from man.

Hunters pay grotesque sums to slaughter lions, even though it is illegal to hunt them almost everywhere in Africa. White lions are especially prized.

In South Africa, a particularly vile practice has emerged, known as canned hunting: lions are captured in the wild as cubs, or bred in captivity, and brought up as tourist attractions.

They are bottle-fed, taught not to fear humans, and spend their days being petted and photographed by unwitting visitors.

But when the cubs grow too big to enchant the tourists, they are put into a small enclosure — to be shot by some foreign ‘hunter’ who wants to hang a lion’s head on his wall and brag that he killed it. One American recently handed over $165,000, or £105,000, to kill a ‘canned’ lion.

For all these grim warnings, the discovery of the cubs is still reason for rejoicing.

‘The birth of these second generation white cubs to a wild white lioness is fantastic news,’ says conservationist Linda Tucker, who has reintroduced seven captive white lions into Timbavati, and who founded the Global White Lion Protection Trust to campaign for their survival. It brings huge hope for the future of white lions.’

The former model, who fell in love with the animals during a safari in 1991, takes a mystical view of the white lions: ‘They are South Africa’s pride and joy, our living national treasure. The Shangaan believe they are sacred animals, and frankly I support the Shangaan on that.’

Sacred or not, that fur is going to need a lot of work before mum is satisfied it’s clean again.
