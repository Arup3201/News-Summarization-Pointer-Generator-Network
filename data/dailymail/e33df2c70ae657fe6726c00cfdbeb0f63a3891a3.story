A New York City cab driver who ran over a British tourist in midtown Manhattan last year - causing her to lose one of her legs - is back on the road.

Following the incident that left Leicester beauty queen Sian Green without a leg, cabbie Mohammed Faysal Himon told reporters that the incident was so horrified by the incident that he didn't want to be a cab driver anymore.

However, he reportedly has been back behind the wheel for months.

Sian 
Green (left), 23, is suing the city of New York for $27.5m because she claims cabbie Faysal Himon (right) shouldn't have been driving when he crashed into her leading to the amputation of her left leg

'He has been driving regularly, 
uneventfully — thank God — and just doing what he has to do,' Himon’s 
lawyer, Cynthia Fisher, told The New York Post.

In
 August of 2013, the cab Himon was driving jumped the curb near West 
49th Street in Manhattan and hit Green, 25, who was sightseeing with a 
friend.

Himon claimed 
at the time that he was cutoff by a man on a bicycle, 41-year-old 
Kenneth Olivo, and then sped up to try and get around him, which caused 
him to lose control of the vehicle and jump the curb.

Vivacious: Green's attorney stated that since returning home to the UK, the 23-year-old has been making great progress in her recovery

Reckless: The Green family are convinced that the incident that left Sian (left) without a leg was not an accident, but rather the result of a negligent act

Following
 the incident, New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission suspended 
Himon's license for 30 days. However, no charges were ever filed against
 him, so the Commission was forced to reinstate his license.

After
 the Commission had to reinstate Himon's license, officials asked him to
 voluntarily surrender it, according to a spokesman for the TLC. He 
refused.

Himon, a 
Bangladeshi native who has been in America for about five years, has a 
history of dangerous driving - even Himon thinks he's a bad driver, he 
admitted to the Post last year.

Since 2011, Himon has been cited for running a red light and for driving 65 mph in a 45-mph zone, amongst other citations.

Since returning to work, Himon's driving record is clean.

Investigation: No charges were filed against the taxi driver in the incident, who reportedly lost control of car after an argument with a cyclist and ploughed into Miss Green

Green, meanwhile, is still adjusting to life as an amputee.

'Back at home in Leicester at the
 end of September, the reality of being an amputee hit me,' she wrote 
last week in The Sun newspaper of London, recalling 'terrifying 
flashbacks' of the incident.

'I had to use crutches or a wheelchair to get 
around, and I couldn’t drive my car anymore. I had no independence, and I
 found that very hard.'

Green
 is pursuing a $27.5 million lawsuit against Himon and the City of New 
York - a lawsuit she filed after law enforcement officials announced 
that Himon wouldn't face any criminal charges.

Green's lawsuit against the city focuses on the fact that Himon's hack license should have been suspended before the August 20 
accident because of his prior driving violations. 

Prosecutors told Green in November that there wasn't 
enough evidence to demonstrate that Himon intended to hit her.

After it was
 announced in the November that no criminal charges would be brought 
against Himon, Green's lawyer released a statement in which he said his 
client was continuing to make progress in her recovery after returning 
to the U.K.

‘While
 she is incredibly dismayed by this decision, she does not let it affect
 her positive spirit, unbelievable strength and incredible poise, which 
she demonstrated to the world throughout this ordeal,’ the statement 
from Daniel Marchese read.

Hero: Green said if it wasn't for the actions of strangers who rushed to help she wouldn't have survived the accident. David Justino (right) used a belt to make a  tourniquet for her leg, while celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz (left) also raced to the scene

He insists that
 the incident that has left his young client without a leg is not an 
accident, but rather the result of ‘a negligent act of calculated 
recklessness.’

In an interview on the Today Show in September, Green said she plans to return to New York someday.

She said: 'I hope to come back one day. It’s not the city’s 
fault. It was the man who made a bad choice, I can’t blame the city for 
that.  It’s a beautiful city and I’d love to come back.'

The aspiring model told the New York Post after being discharged from the hospital that she will not let the horrific incident 
destroy her dreams.

Green's
 Facebook account shows that the 23-year-old woman has been keeping 
busy, spending time with friends and attending parties.

One
 picture posted in October showed the 23-year-old employee of the Hugo 
Boss fashion house posing in a green dress with a pair of girlfriends at
 a soiree while holding onto a walker. 

The crash happened on the second day of her trip to the city and she did not get to do the things she wanted.

'The only thing I really wanted to do was go to the top of the Empire 
State Building,' she said. 'I wanted to go shopping, meet up with a few friends, do the 
typical New York things.'

Aspirations: Sian Green hoped to become a model and was training to be a buyer for Hugo Boss

Passersby rushed to help Miss Green 
immediately after the incident. Plumber David Justino used his belt to 
make a life-saving tourniquet for her leg while a pizza truck owner 
raced to put her foot on ice.

They
 were also helped by celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, better known on U.S. TV
 as Dr Oz, who hurried to the scene from his nearby office.

Her appearance in the Today studio took place just one block from the scene of the crash.

During
 her appearance on the Today show, Green admitted that she had had 
some unpleasant flashbacks: 'I haven't been out in five weeks. It takes 
me back a little bit, even when I see a yellow car.... But I'll get 
there.'

The 23-year-old 
brunette talked about her memories of the accident.

'I couldn't move,' she said. 'It was one of those things. If I had gone left, it would have 
gotten me, if I had gone right, it would've gotten me.'

Friends and relatives say Green's naturally good-spirited nature has helped her through a hard time.

'It's quite difficult, but she's a very optimistic person,' Sian's sister Stacey told Today. 'She just takes it day by day.'

Green said her most vivid memory of the day 
is walking around the city, getting a drink, going to Times Square and 
having a great time with her best friend, Keshia Warren.

Miss
 Green paid tribute to her friend, who was with her during the accident 
and hasn't left her side since. 'She's been my rock,' Green said. 'I 
couldn't do half the things without her, I really couldn't.'
