Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has been forced into an embarrassing backdown over his controversial comments towards 'Chinese mongrels' and 'Chinese b***ards', by delivering a letter of apology to the Chinese Ambassador today.

After coming under increasing fire for his bizarre rant last Monday night, Mr Palmer's has delivered a letter to 'His Excellency Mr MA Zhaoxu'.

In it he says: 'I most sincerely apologise for any insult to the Chinese people caused by any of the language I used during my appearance on the ABC television program Q&A.

'I regret any hurt or anguish such comments may have caused any party and I look forward to greater understanding for peace and cooperation in the future.'

He went on to say that 'we always must have an open mind' and that 'I now come to the realisation that what I said on Q&A was an insult to Chinese people everywhere and I wish to assure them they have my most genuine and sincerely apology, that I am sorry that I said the things I said on the program.' 

Clive Palmer had said about the Chinese that 'they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country', now he says sorry and that 'it is in the interest of the whole world that Australia and China have good relations'.

Friends again.  This is a picture from back in 2009 where Clive Palmer and Junhua Wu of Metallurgical Corporation of China celebrated the China First mining venture.

He also added that 'it is in the interest of the whole world that Australia and China have good relations'.

Mr Palmer had been roundly criticised for the rant and his comments labelled 'racist'. Several community leaders and Coalition MPs said the tirade could hurt Australia's trade relationship with China.

The Palmer United Party leader tried to appease those critics by suggesting his comments were directed against CITIC Pacific, with whom he's locked in a series of legal disputes, even going as far as tweeting his position.

CITIC has accused Mr Palmer of using $12 million to fund his election campaign in 2013. 

The verbal spray included him calling Chinese people 'bastards' and 'mongrels' who 'shoot their own people'.

'The Chinese government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free. So far they've shifted $200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it. I don't mind standing up against the Chinese bastards and stop them from doing it,' he said.

He then claimed he was owed 'about $500 million by the Communist Chinese government.'

'We'll be suing them and they'll be answering the questions. We've had... an arbitration against these Chinese mongrels - I'm saying that because they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country. And we're not going to let them,' he said.

In an attempt to smooth things over, foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the Chinese embassy that 'these were the comments of one Member of Parliament and not representative'. The PM also chimed in by calling them 'over the top, shrill and wrong'.

Mr Palmer will hope his letter of apology will bring to an end a forgettable fortnight for his party with his problems exacerbated by star Senate recruit Glenn Lazarus being forced to fend off plagiarism claims and Jacqui Lambie's suggestions Australia needed to significantly boost its military presence or risk 'letting our grandchildren become slaves'.
