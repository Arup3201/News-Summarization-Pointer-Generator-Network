The Faraway Tree books by Enid Blyton are to be brought to the big screen by Oscar-winning director, Sam Mendes.

The stories about a group of children and their adventures in a gigantic tree in a magical forest captivated generations of British children, and Mendes is hoping a film of their tales will bring Blyton's magic to the cinema.

His firm Neal Street Productions, whose credits include Call The Midwife and the Oscar-nominated Revolutionary Road, will make a live action film based on the four books, written between 1939 and 1951.

Blyton's series of four novels, The Enchanted Wood, The Magic Faraway Tree, The Folk Of The Faraway Tree, and Up The Faraway Tree, are based around the tree, which is tall enough to reach the clouds and home to small houses. 

Pippa Harris from Neal Street Productions, which last year brought Roald Dahl's Charlie And The Chocolate Factory to London's West End, said: 'The Magic Faraway Tree is one of the most loved children's books series from an iconic author whose work has been adored by generations. 

'To be able to adapt these for the big screen is incredibly exciting.'

Blyton, best known for her Famous Five and Secret Seven books, died in 1968 but her books have remained popular and have sold more than 500 million copies and been translated into more than 40 languages.

Marlene Johnson, of the Enid Blyton Estate, said: 'Enid Blyton was a passionate advocate of children's storytelling, and The Magic Faraway Tree is a fantastic example of her creative imagination.

'It's a much loved title, so we're very excited to announce we've signed an option agreement for development of The Magic Faraway Tree film with Neal Street Productions.

The James Bond film Skyfall, with Daniel Craig, was directed by Mendes, who's now working on the next one

'Many generations have grown up with The Magic Faraway Tree and today's news provides a great chance to share the wonder of these stories through a new medium.'

Mendes, who was married to Kate Winslet, by whom he has a ten-year-old son, directed the most recent James Bond film, Skyfall, starring Daniel Craig.  He is currently directing the 24th Bond film, which is due for release next year.

The British director, who is dating actress Rebecca Hall, won a Best Director Oscar and Golden Globe for American Beauty, which came out in 1999.
