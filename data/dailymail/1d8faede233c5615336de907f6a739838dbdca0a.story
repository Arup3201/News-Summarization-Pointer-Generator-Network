A hilarious spoof of political drama ‘House of Cards’ that debuted last night at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner saw Washington big leaguers taking aim at Hollywood heavyweights with the goading hand of star Kevin Spacey.

The aptly titled ‘House of Nerds’ starred Spacey in the same role he plays on the Netflix original series, that of remorseless politico Frances Underwood.

Underwood is gunning for the best seats he can get at ‘Nerd Prom’ and goes to great lengths to get them in the video, reaching out to the likes of John McCain, Valerie Jarrett, and Michael Bloomberg.

Perfect match: Worlds collided in a 'House of Cards' spoof starring Kevin Spacey at Saturday's White House Correspondents' Dinner as politicos went Hollywood

All of Hollywood’s biggest names and DC’s most powerful players watched as McCain, the former Republican presidential nominee, poked fun at host Saturday’s emcee Conan O’Brien.

‘He’s the one that got fired from 'The Tonight Show,' right?’ McCain asks.

McCain also refused to sit beside former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

‘She keeps trying to friend me on Facebook,’ the 76-year-old Arizona senator complained.

Another equally unlikely, but just as funny, cameo was made by one of President Obama’s closest confidantes, Valerie Jarrett.

‘What on Earth happened,’ Jarrett asked the fake congressman. ‘You know I was supposed to sit next to Conan.’

And though he’s had his problems with the president, even New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg shows up.

‘You can’t run for mayor again,’ Underwood counsels three-term Mayor Bloomberg. ‘That’ll put Anthony Weiner in a pickle and then he’ll tweet that pickle.’

Several other notable lawmakers show up, including House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who’s hoarding Ravens tickets, and everyone’s favorite interviewer of politicians, Charlie Rose.

The first Netflix series produced just for the streaming platform created a great deal of buzz after its February 1 release.

That, paired with its propensity to portray the seedier, sharkier side of politics, makes it no surprise that Beltway insiders would jump at the chance to help spoof ‘House of Cards,’ Hollywood, and themselves.

And Spacey’s character closes the spoof with an appropriate greeting.

‘I hope some of you were taking notes…Mr. President, welcome to Nerd Prom.'
