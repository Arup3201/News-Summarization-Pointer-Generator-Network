Nowadays video game graphics are so impressive that it can be hard to distinguish them a Hollywood blockbuster film.

But despite the amazing advances in graphics, most people have a soft spot for the primitive pixelated images used in arcade games such as Pac-Man and Donkey Kong.

Now, a video shows the startling improvement in the quality of video games graphics in just 30 years.

Pacman is an arcade game developed by Namco and first released in Japan in 1980. Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium and an icon of 1980s popular culture

It focuses on the introductions or start screens of some of the most popular gaming titles ever made.

Created by bloggers, THE ART OF TITLE, who make compilation videos of title sequences, the video, which lasts just under two-and-a-half minutes, includes favourite games ranging from Super Mario Bros. and Zelda to Call of Duty and L.A. Noire.

Nintendo launched Donkey Kong in 1981. The original game was the first appearance of Mario, pre-dating the well-known Super Mario Bros. by four years. The title included platform and action puzzle types, featuring Donkey Kong as the opponent against Mario in an industrial construction setting

The Legend of Zelda was a bestseller for Nintendo, selling over 6.5 million copies. It's often featured in lists of games considered the greatest or most influential and is thought to be a spiritual forerunner of the role-playing video game

Mega Man II did not realise huge sales when it was released in Japan in 1988, but is a cult title. The game continues the protagonist's battle against the evil Dr Wily and his rogue robots

A Brief History of Video Game Title Design from Art of the Title

The chronological video gives a good 
flavour of the advances in technology, showing lines getting smoother, 
movements more fluid and human characters progressively more realistic, Sploid reported.

Video games of the early1980s were arcade-friendly and relatively short in length, they developed rapidly into games with plots and multiple stages, such as in Star Wars and Zelda.

The Last Ninja 3 (pictured) is an action-adventure video game that was developed and published by System 3 for the Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST in 1991

Computer adventure game Full Throttle features voice actors Roy Conrad and Mark Hamill (from Star Wars). It was released in 1995 on CD-ROM

Resident Evil is a survival horror video game series that began in 1996. Since then, the game series has branched out to include action games and has sold 50 million units as of June 2012

In the 1990s, when more people had games consoles at home, there was a trend for platform games and '3D' graphics.

A host of ambitious offerings with increasingly realistic characters burst onto the scene, such as Splinter Cell and Resident Evil Outbreak.

Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth video game,which was first published in 1998 for the PlayStation video game console. The game follows Solid Snake - a soldier who infiltrates a nuclear weapons facility to neutralise the terrorist threat from FOXHOUND, a renegade special forces unit

Some imagery from Killzone 2, which was released in 2009. The game is presented almost entirely from a first person perspective, aside from vehicular combat. Killzone 2 features a 'lean and peek' cover system, which allows the player to take cover behind an object and then pop out to fire at enemies

Borderlands (pictured) was released in 2009 and includes character-building elements found in role-playing games, leading Gearbox to call the game a 'role-playing shooter'

The Metal Gear Solid titles mentioned in 
the video arguably show the most dramatic change in the quality of 
graphics from the early Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake to the latest title in
the series.

Grand Theft Auto V is one of the latest examples in the compilation video showing the most advanced graphics.

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was released in 2007 for multiple games consoles. The first-person shooter title was noticeably more relaitic than previous titles and was the top-selling game worldwide for 2007 - selling around seven million copies by January 2008 and over thirteen million by May 2009

Red Dead Redemption, released in 2011, (pictured) is played from a third-person perspective in an open world environment, allowing the player to interact with the game world at their leisure. The player can travel the virtual world, a fictionalised version of the Western United States, primarily by horseback and on foot

A still from L.A. Noire, released in 2011. The game is notable for using newly developed technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle

The eagerly-anticipated video game release pulled in over $1 billion sales after three days of its launch in September - a rate faster than any other video game, film or other entertainment product has ever managed, according to its creator Take Two Interactive Inc.

The game reportedly cost around £170 million to make and market, which is more than Hollywood films such as Avatar.

An image from Deus Ex: Human Revolution, released in 2011. The game follows Adam Jensen, a security manager at a growing biotechnology firm. After terrorists brutally attack the headquarters, the mortally wounded Jensen is forced to undergo radical life-saving surgeries that replace large areas of his body with advanced prostheses

The graphics of Tomb Raider's 2013 release are a far cry from those used in the original title of 1996. The protagonist Lara Croft went on to become a major icon of the virtual gaming industry. The Guinness Book of World Records has recognised her as the 'most successful human virtual game heroine'

Grand Theft Auto V, which was released in September, reportedly cost around £170 million to make and market, which is more than Hollywood films such as Avatar
