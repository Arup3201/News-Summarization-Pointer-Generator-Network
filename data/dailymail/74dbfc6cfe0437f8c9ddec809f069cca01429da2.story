On trial: Darren Sapstead arriving at court yesterday. He begged jurors to find him not guilty

A British tourist told a court today of the chilling moment alleged Tenerife booze cruise killer Darren Sapstead admitted: 'I did it, he deserved it.'

Lucy Smethurst turned the clocks back nearly 17 years to November 1996 as she claimed the kitchen fitter confessed to pushing Garry Walton, 21, to his death after an afternoon's drinking games at high sea.

The apprentice builder, originally from Leeds, west Yorkshire, drowned after falling from the boat the trio were on in an incident originally written off by Spanish investigators as an accident.

Lucy, a 14-year-old girl at the time, 
told a jury in the Tenerife capital Santa CruzÂ  she was drunk and had 
her head on a table so did not see the moment Garry went overboard and 
just heard the commotion.

But she added: 'Darren made an 
unarranged visit with a friend to our hotel the following day and me and
my sister went to eat something with them.

'I thought Garry had died by accident 
but the conversation between the four of us over the table was going 
along the lines that Darren did it.

'I was shocked to hear it because I didn't know what had really happened on board the boat.

'I remember very clearly saying to Darren, 'So you pushed him' and he said, 'Yes.'

'I then said, 'Do you feel guilty?' and he said, 'No, he deserved it.'

'Darren said at the time, 'Don't say 
anything'. We were scared, we felt intimidated and together we decided 
we wouldn't say anything.'

Father-of-two Sapstead, 38, from Woodham 
Ferrers near Chelmsford, Essex, is accused of Mr Walton's homicide and 
faces 12 years in jail if found guilty.

The long-awaited trial comes after a 
protracted campaign by Garry's parents Robert and Catherine to unlock 
the mystery of their son's death.

Mrs Smethurst, giving her evidence 
behind a screen shielding her from the alleged killer, admitted under 
cross-examination she had changed her story after claiming in initial 
statements in Spain and the UK the death was an accident and Sapstead 
was not involved.

But she insisted it was because she was 'young, vulnerable and very scared of telling the truth.'

She waited until September 1997 - 10 
months after the incident - to make a statement in her native Manchester
pointing the finger at Sapstead.

'I didn't know if Darren would try to 
approach us but when I got back home after some time I decided I 
couldn't live with what I knew,' she told the court.

'I knew the truth and couldn't keep it inside.

'It's not fair what happened that day. It's not fair on the victim's family.'

Older sister Katie, just 17 when she 
went on the fateful booze cruise and the only eye witness to Garry's 
death called by state prosecutors, said Sapstead threw him to his death 
seconds after asking her, 'Shall I throw him overboard?'

She told the court: 'Garry was very drunk and it all happened very very quickly.

'He was picked up and taken right next to the railing and forced over. He didn't fall over.'

Sapstead's defence lawyer Carlos 
Valenciano said Katie told Manchester police in a statement in September
1997 when she first incriminated Sapstead that she had screamed: 'I 
didn't do it, I didn't do it.' after tourists on board the boat started 
having a go at her as they discovered Garry had gone overboard.

But she denied under cross-examination
she was trying to divert attention from the suspicion she was 
responsible for his death and insisted she delayed telling the truth 
because she felt 'intimidated' by Sapstead.

Return: Mr Sapstead voluntarily returned to Spain to stand trial and could face 12 years in prison

Hearing: Proceedings opened on Monday after a long-running legal battle over Mr Walton's death

A police officer called to the boat 
admitted they were told Garry had been pushed after rushing to the 
Tenerife port of Los Cristianos to meet the incoming tourists.

Detectives only took five people in for questioning of the estimated 45 people on board.

They included Sapstead and Katie Smethurst, identified by other tourists as the last two people seen with the dead man.

Katie was questioned by a Spanish 
investigating judge after her police quiz but Garry's alleged killer was
allowed to leave Tenerife after a police interview.

The officer, who was not named in 
court, said: 'We were sure at least one of those two knew exactly what 
had happened but they each told us exactly the same story and we 
couldn't get to the bottom of it.'

Mr Sapstead has voluntarily returned to stand trial on homicide charges in Tenerife

Garry's parents were in court again 
today wearing T-shirts with a picture of their son's face under the 
words 'Queremos Justicia' - Spanish for 'We want justice.'

The couple, who moved to Ireland from 
Leeds with their family when Garry was a teenager, had to exhume his 
body 10 months after his burial when evidence came to light casting 
doubt on the original ruling his death was an accident.

An investigating judge in Tenerife 
shelved the case against Mr Sapstead three times - only to bring charges
against him after repeated appeals by the couple's lawyer Pedro Ripoll.

Mr Ripoll retired in 2007 - and both he and Garry's parents only found out by chance this week's trial had been scheduled.

The Waltons have become grandparents 
five times since the death of their son - and Mr Sapstead has become a 
father twice with his 16-year-old daughter now studying for her GSCEs.

He has pleaded not guilty to Mr Walton's homicide.

The trial, expected to finish hearing evidence tomorrow, continues.
