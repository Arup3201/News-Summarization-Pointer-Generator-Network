Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Premier League starting XI of the day.

Saturday saw Newcastle inflict more damage on Liverpool's season, while Chelsea struggled to a 2-1 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

Alexis Sanchez was the star man for Arsenal again in a 3-0 victory over Burnley, while West Ham came from two goals down to rescue a point against Stoke.

Here is our team of the day.  

GK - Tom Heaton (BURNLEY vs Arsenal) - 8

Sami Mokbel at the Emirates Stadium 

Conceding three goals may not look good on paper, but had it not been for Heaton in sublime form between the sticks on Saturday Arsenal would have been on for a thrashing against Burnley.

The English goalkeeper denied Santi Cazorla, Lukas Podolski and Theo Walcott with fine saves to keep the score down on Saturday.

Tom Heaton may have been beaten three times on Saturday but he was in inspired form 

DEF - Daryl Janmaat (NEWCASTLE vs Liverpool) - 7.5

Craig Hope at St James' Park 

Strong in the tackle – upending Balotelli at the cost of a booking – but was purposeful in attack as well, although he was lucky to avoid second yellow.

Janmaat was extremely energetic as Newcastle outplayed Liverpool. 

Daryl Janmaat was solid in defence and dangerous going forward as Newcastle beat Liverpool 2-0 

DEF - Geoff Cameron (STOKE CITY vs West ham) - 7.5

Laurie Whitwell at the Britannia Stadium 

Not usually highlighted for his attacking play, but the versatile American set up Victor Moses for Stoke's first of the afternoon and could have had a goal of his own were it not for a fine save from Adrian.

Cameron will just be kicking himself his side let a two-goal lead slip. 

Geoff Cameron had a huge helping hand in the first goal as Stoke City and West Ham drew 2-2 

DEF - Steven Taylor (NEWCASTLE vs Liverpool) - 7.5

Craig Hope at St James' Park 

No-nonsense defending throughout and kept Balotelli out of the game. Three wins from three since he came into side.

Impressed alongside Janmaat, Fabricio Coloccini and Paul Dummett. 

Steven Taylor was an influential figure for Newcastle and has won all three games since returning to the side 

DEF - Kieran Gibbs (ARSENAL vs Burnley) - 7

Sami Mokbel at the Emirates Stadium 

May not have been fully fit but the left-back showed no signs of that on Saturday. 

Calum Chambers may be credited with a goal and an assist but Gibbs was just as influential, bombing forward tirelessly against a dogged Burnley defence. 

Kieran Gibbs was a threat going forward against a tiring Burnley defence on Saturday 

MID - Nemanja Matic (CHELSEA vs QPR) - 8

Jack Gaughan at Stamford Bridge 

Peerless, yet again. Isn’t handed the plaudits the flair players are for obvious reasons, but there isn’t a better midfielder ahead of a back four in the Premier League. 

Nemanja Matic is the new Claude Makelele for Chelsea and there is no better holding midfielder in England 

MID - Moussa Sissoko (NEWCASTLE vs Liverpool) - 8.5

Craig Hope at St James' Park 

Menacing runs from deep asked questions of Reds and it was he who had major say in winning goal. Immense from first minute to last. 

A man of the match performance. 

Moussa Sissoko was a driving force for Newcastle in midfield was the man of the match 

MID - Jonathan Walters (STOKE CITY vs West Ham) - 8

Laurie Whitwell at the Britannia Stadium 

Credited with the man of the match award as he combined persistent running with a cutting final ball on Saturday.

Covered 10.8km from the wing against the Hammers. 

Jonathan Walters worked incredible hard for Stoke against West Ham 

MID - Alexis Sanchez (ARSENAL vs Burnley) - 8.5

Sami Mokbel at the Britannia Stadium 

Again, it was down to Alexis Sanchez to save Arsenal.

It is a story that is becoming all too familiar at the moment — when Arsenal are in a spot of bother, up pops Sanchez — but £30 million buys you a talented footballer who is the embodiment of a match-winner.

MID - Oscar (CHELSEA vs QPR) - 8.5

Jack Gaughan at Stamford Bridge 

Absolutely marvellous finish for the first goal, curling an effort with the outside of his foot beyond Rob Green from 18 yards. Gets better each week. 

Oscar scored this stunner to put Chelsea on their way against QPR on Saturday 

FWD - Charlie Austin (QPR vs Chelsea) - 7.5

Jack Gaughan at Stamford Bridge 

Thankless task up there on his own. Tried his best to ruffle the feathers of Cahill and Terry and linked up nicely in spells. Excellently-improvised flicked finish for the equaliser. 

Charlie Austin did so well to work the Chelsea defence on Saturday and was rewarded with a goal
