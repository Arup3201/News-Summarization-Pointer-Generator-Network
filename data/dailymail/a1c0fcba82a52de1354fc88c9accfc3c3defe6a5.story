Life as Floyd Mayweather Jnr looks to be good - he has been all over social media recently showing off his Bugatti collection and luxury lifestyle - and now the undefeated boxer is reveling in his new relationship with massage therapist Doralie Medina.

Mayweather has been sending out his best wishes to the No 1 member of his 'Money Team' on her her birthday - and Medina has been showing off their new love too by posting an intimate glimpse into the life of the new couple on her Instagram account.

The snap shows the 37-year-old boxer offering up a kiss to Medina in familiar surroundings for the man who reportedly made £600million in the past year - a casino.

Medina has long worked with Mayweather as a masseuse and member of his team - but they are now seeing each other after his ugly split with ex-fiance Shantel Jackson earlier this year.

'Happy birthday @badmedina. I appreciate you and I LOVE you,' Mayweather posted on Instagram.

'You've been by my side for 5 years and helped me win 5 of my 11 World titles. Every time I called on you, you were my shoulder to cry on and a friend that I could talk to about anything. Every gift you received from me, you truly deserve because you're a gift that God gave me.'

The five-division world champion is preparing for a rematch with Marcos Maidana on September 13.
