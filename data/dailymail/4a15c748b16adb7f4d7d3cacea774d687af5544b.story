Devastated workers left jobless by the collapse of photography chain Jessops have resorted to sticking their pictures in the store window in a desperate bid to find work.

Employees of the Warrington branch plastered the window with their images along with a sign that reads: 'Five unemployed and loyal staff seeking work. Can you help?'

Former sales expert Lanza Martineta said he and his fellow team-members - some of whom have worked for Jessops for up to 15 years - wanted to show the 'real faces' behind yet another blow to the British High Street.

Around 1,370 shop staff were left jobless when Jessops closed its 187 stores across the UK last week.

Further redundancies at the chain's head office in Leicester also look likely.

Mr Martineta, 44, said their window display - which also includes a sign that reads: 'What's happening to our high streets?' - had created quite a stir in the town centre.

'It's brought quite a bit of attention,' said Mr Martineta, who said people had come in to sympathise with the team as they packed away stock and equipment inside the closed store.

'We have had literally hundreds of people knocking on our doors to tell us how sorry they were that we were going,' said the former salesman, who had worked for Jessops for around four years.

'They were saying it's now almost impossible to get your photos printed in the centre of town.

'We were packing up the goods for the administrators. It was really quite distressing.

'Each member of staff at the store was completely passionate about photography.

'I'm actually a photographer myself. I worked there because I genuinely liked it.'

The team's collective enthusiasm for their work made the news of their fate all the more devastating according to Mr Martineta, who said staff only learned of the chain's collapse when a journalist called the Warrington branch for a comment.

'It was really out of the blue,' he said. 'We had no warning.

'I've seen my colleagues crying, wondering how they are going to pay their rents.'

Mr Martineta said they were all hoping that their window display might encourage potential future employers to get in touch.

High street casualty: All 187 Jessops stores nationwide have ceased trading

Mr Martineta, who in the meantime intends to concentrate on his professional photographic work after losing his position at Jessops, said this latest retail casualty indicated a bleak future for the British High Street.

'When Comet went down I did pay it some attention, but it doesn't really hit you until it happens to you,' said Mr Martineta, adding that Jessops had struggled to compete with internet retailers.

'People were coming in for our expert advice, then using that to buy stock online,' he said.

'I do think we could have adapted better. It is a crying shame.

As Britain's only specialist camera retailer, Jessops had been a fixture on high streets nationwide for almost 80 years.

Its collapse followed that of a number of familiar high street names over the course of last year, including fellow camera retailer Jacobs in June 2012, and Comet in November.

Peacocks, La Senza and Clinton Cards also went under last year.

Shocked by the disappearance of Jessops from Britain's high streets - and the loss of more than 1,000 jobs - a photography firm has offered an apprenticeship to one of the stricken chain's former employees.

Blake Ezra, pictured right, who runs London-based Blake Ezra Photography, said the firm was keen to take on an apprentice and had decided to offer it to someone affected by Jessops' collapse.

'It's terrible that, in one year, Jacobs, Jessops and Comet have disappeared from our high streets, leaving very limited options for camera buyers and photography enthusiasts,' Mr Ezra said.

'We already have one apprentice and strongly believe in bringing young enthusiastic people on board to grow with us.'

Mr Ezra said whoever was selected for the year-long apprenticeship could potentially go on to a long-standing career with the firm.

'Young people in the UK nowadays get a rough deal,' he said.

'There are many talented and passionate people who simply cannot get a break.

'I really believe that apprenticeships are a great way to find your feet in an industry that is increasingly difficult to break into,' he added.

Former Jessops employees interested in applying for the apprenticeship with Blake Ezra Photography should e-mail their CV to info@blakeezraphotography.com.

The apprenticeship is subsidised, and the successful candidate will gain an HND in photography over the course of the year.Â
