Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the gunman who held up to 17 people hostage at a Sydney café was known to have had 'an infatuation with extremism' and 'mental instability'.

Man Haron Monis, 50, died this morning after police stormed the Lindt Chocolate Café in Sydney's Martin Place where he had held his victims for more than 16 hours.

Mr Abbott confirmed that Monis was known to State and Commonwealth authorities in a statement on Tuesday morning, adding: 'we also know that he posted graphic extremist material online'.

'He had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability,' Mr Abbott said.

'We know that he sent offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan and was found guilty of offences related to this.'

However the Prime Minister dubbed the siege as only a 'brush with terrorism', stating that: 'As the siege unfolded yesterday, he [Monis] sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the ISIL death cult.'

During the siege, Monis had forced hostages to hold up a black flag with white Arabic writing, an emblem linked to terror groups 

He thanked NSW police and extended his sympathy to the families of the two hostages who died at the siege

'He had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability,' The Prime Minister said of Monis

'These events do demonstrate that even a country as free, as open, as generous and as safe as ours is vulnerable to acts of politically motivated violence but they also remind us that Australia and Australians are resilient and we are ready to respond,' Mr Abbott said.

'Australians should be reassured by the way our law enforcement and security agencies responded to this brush with terrorism.

'There is nothing more Australian than dropping in at the local cafe for a morning coffee and it's tragic beyond words that people going about their everyday business should have been caught up in such a horrific incident.'

Mr Abbott added: 'There is nothing more Australian than dropping in at the local cafe for a morning coffee and it's tragic beyond words that people going about their everyday business should have been caught up in such a horrific incident'

He also revealed he would be arriving in Sydney later on Tuesday afternoon to be briefed by police and security agencies.

'Plainly, there are lessons to be learned and we will thoroughly examine this incident to decide what lessons can be learned,' Mr Abbot said.
