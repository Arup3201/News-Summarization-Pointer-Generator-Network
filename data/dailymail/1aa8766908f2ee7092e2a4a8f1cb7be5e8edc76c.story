It may appear to be a barren, hostile world today, but soon Mars could be host to blooming flowers and hanging fruit, if Nasa has its way.

The space agency is planning to send seeds on its next Mars rover, which is scheduled to launch in mid-2020 and land on the red planet in 2021.

The mission, known as the Mars Plant Experiment (MPX), aims to create a small Martian greenhouse which, if successful, could pave the way for humans living on the planet.

At nearly £14,000 ($23,000) to send a kilogram of food into space, cosmic cuisine doesn’t come cheap. 

But Nasa hopes that in the future it can grow vast quantities of its own food in space.

As
 well as cutting costs, Nasa is hoping a 'space farm' will  deliver a 
lasting supply of food for astronauts on deep space missions.

It
 could also provide something called ‘horticultural therapy’ for 
astronauts to reduce stress, alleviate depression and improve their 
overall general health.

The work is part of the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink LED lamps.

Nasa
 claims that after extensive testing on plants on Earth, it doesn’t 
expect zero-gravity conditions to affect the growth of the plants

‘In order to do a long-term, sustainable base on Mars, you would want to be able to establish that plants can at least grow on Mars,’ MPX deputy principal investigator Heather Smith told the ‘Humans 2 Mars’ conference in Washington. 

‘This would be the first step in that…we just send the seeds there and watch them grow.’

MPX would use a CubeSat box – a case used for smaller and cheaper satellites — which would be attached to the outer body of the 2020 rover. This box would hold Earth air and about 
200 seeds of Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant that is widely used as
 a model organism in plant biology.

Seeds would receive water when the rover touched down on the red planet, and would then be allowed to grow for two weeks or so. In around 15 days, the scientists expect to have a small greenhouse with signs of life

The MPX is designed to be entirely self-contained to avoid any possibility that Earth life could escape and flourish on Mars, according to a report in Space.com.

The seeds would receive water when the rover touched down on the red planet, and would then be allowed to grow for two weeks.

In around 15 days, the scientists expect to have a small greenhouse with signs of life.

The hope is the alien garden would allow researchers to see how Earth life can cope with the red planet’s high radiation levels and low gravity.

Compared to Earth, the environmental conditions on Mars are extreme with a non-breathable thin, low pressure carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, extremely strong radiation from the sun.

Temperatures are on average -63 °C and it has 38 per cent of the gravity that we have on the Earth.

With plans underway for a manned-mission to Mars, any possibility of humans growing their own food on this hostile planet would mean a smaller launch cost and a higher chance of survival.

‘We would go from this simple experiment to the greenhouses on Mars for a sustainable base,’ Ms Smith said. ‘That would be the goal.’

‘It also would be the first multicellular organism to grow, live and die on another planet.’

Super bugs from Earth could 
soon hitch a ride into space, arrive on the red planet and trick 
scientists into thinking they are Martians.

This
 is according to Nasa researcher, Dr Kasthuri Venkateswaran, who has 
expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to 
colonise Mars. 

Dr 
Venkateswaran highlights recent research that shows some bugs are more 
resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to 
survive deep space flights.

Currently,
 spacecraft landing on Mars or other planets where life might exist must
 meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life.

These
 acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms 
survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel.

‘If
 you are able to reduce the numbers to acceptable levels, a proxy for 
cleanliness, the assumption is that the life forms will not survive 
under harsh space conditions,’ Dr Venkateswaran said.

However,
 spores of Bacillus pumilus have shown high resistance to techniques 
used to clean spacecraft, such as ultraviolet radiation and peroxide 
treatment.

When researchers exposed this hardy 
organism to a simulated Mars environment that kills standard spores in 
30 seconds, it survived 30 minutes.
