Britain's College of Optometrists revealed yesterday the strangest situations that people have found themselves in which prompted a trip to the opticians

While another chatted up a stranger in a bar thinking it was his girlfriend.

A student's eyesight was so bad he turned up to the wrong exam room after misreading a sign and subsequently missed his exam.

The long list of embarrassing blunders stretched from the awkward, such as the maths teacher who confused students by misreading a minus sign as an equal sign, to the downright dangerous.

Several people took a trip to the opticians after accidentally driving the wrong way down a one-way street while one driver mistook traffic bollards for children in the road.

In one ironic case, a visually-impaired woman had strolled into a High Street opticians and began taking off her shoes and socks- thinking she was at the foot specialist next door. 

Other eyesight related mishaps include a regular better who was forced to have an eye test after he could no longer read the names of horses in the Racing Post, and another person turned for help after being unable to cut their own toenails.

A man even found himself losing friends because of his poor eyesight after blanking them because he failed to recognise them across the street.

Despite finding themselves in these embarrassing and sometimes dangerous situations, more than one in three of the 2,000 people questioned said they put off having an eye test for 'months' after noticing their eyesight worsening.

Dr Susan Blakeney, clinical adviser to the College of Optometrists, said: 'Although these anecdotes may be extreme examples, there is a serious message behind this. It is important to be aware of the health of your eyes and to seek professional advice early if you notice any changes to avoid these sorts of accidents.

'We see too many people who leave it weeks or months after noticing problems before they go to see an optometrist.

'The earlier an eye condition is diagnosed, the more effective the treatment is likely to be. Regular eye exams are especially important as you get older.'
