After a lifetime of working hard, pensioners deserve to raise a toast to retirement.

And these days they’re doing just that – enjoying a daily tipple at 6.30pm.

Some prefer to crack open a bottle a little earlier, around 4pm, but others can’t even wait that long... and say cheers with their first glass at lunchtime. 

Researchers found the majority of pensioners are making the most of their later years with a packed diary of social engagements, days out, short breaks, holidays and shopping, as well as time spent outside (file image)

With such a relaxed start to the day, it’s no wonder that a poll of retirees aged 60 and over found 94 per cent are enjoying their post-work life, while half said they are having more fun than ever before.

Improvements in healthcare and living standards mean that these days pensioners have the energy to manage a hectic social diary, buoyed up by an average disposable income of £330 a month, which allows them to go on three holidays, two weekends away and 17 day trips a year.

The survey found that 6.30pm is retirees’ favourite time to enjoy a tipple or two. A third of those polled said they drink alcohol between 6pm and 7pm, while one in ten prefer a late afternoon drink between 4pm and 5pm, and a hardy one in 20 kick off their socialising between 1pm and 3pm.

More than half said they drink wine, while the rest opt for spirits or beer.

The study also showed that most pensioners eat out three times a month, but one in ten do so more than twice a week.

This is despite family commitments, with retirees dedicating an average of six hours a week to looking after their grandchildren. Of those who do not already care for grandchildren, two-thirds said they would like to in the future.

Most said they are active and exercise at least six times a month. The most popular activities are brisk walking, gardening and rambling. But a more ambitious 17 per cent participate in cycling, Zumba or salsa dancing.

And one in 20 take at least five weekend breaks in Britain every year. Almost three-quarters said they feel a lot younger than their actual age, with the same proportion saying retirement is better than they expected.

It’s no wonder then that 20 per cent of those polled said they wish they had retired years ago.

Going on a cruise, taking up a new hobby and buying a dog are common achievements in the first year of retirement, while IT lessons and losing weight were also popular among those polled.

Shortly after retiring, a third said they booked lunch dates with friends, a quarter revamped their house and one in ten signed up to Facebook. A glamorous few said they plan to or had already invested in makeovers or cosmetic surgery.

Senior Railcard, which runs a rail discount scheme for train companies, polled 1,260 pensioners.

Andrew Robertson, of Senior Railcard, said: ‘Our poll showed that adults in their 60s, 70s and 80s are determined to make the most of life in retirement and have no intention of slowing down.

‘For so much of our lives we are restricted by our working hours, so if pensioners are filling their time with holidays, day trips and meals out, that can only be a good thing.

‘This research shows that retirees place a lot of importance on travel when they finish work.’

A separate report published yesterday said the average pensioner had made almost £1,200 a month from their home in the last six months.

Soaring property prices meant London homeowners were the biggest winners, making £20,700 a month since August, financial specialist Key Retirement said.
