'You can still finish first without being attractive': Researchers said British winner Bradley Wiggins (pictured) might be bucking the trend

They already get the girl. Now it seems that handsome men also finish first in endurance sports.

A study of the elite cyclists in the 2012 Tour de France found that the best-looking men raced ahead.

It is thought just as a stag’s antlers are a sign of strength and masculinity, a man’s face advertises his underlying staying power.

The Swiss researchers began by showing people head and shoulder shots of elite cyclists from the Tour de France and asking them to rate their looks.

They then compared this with how well they did in the race, which covers 2,000 miles in 23 days and is often considered to be the world’s toughest endurance event.  

As a rider’s overall position is highly dependent on team tactics, the calculation also included the men’s performance when racing in individual time trials.

The best-looking cyclists were also the fastest, the journal Biology Letters reports.  

Importantly, although the men and women judging the photos knew the men were cyclists, they did not know how good they were at the sport.

This, said researcher Erik Postma, shows evidence of a link between looks and endurance. He thinks that women in particular have evolved to use a man’s face as quick way of judging his endurance.

Good performance: Rui Costa, the reigning world champion, fared well in the study by Swiss researchers

In times gone by, a man with staying power would be able to last the pace when hunting for days on end on the plains of Africa and bring back food for the family. 

It is also possible that the men who did best were the most competitive and there is something about a determination to win that we find appealing.

Frenchman Amaël Moinard was judged to be the most handsome cyclist. Rui Costa, the reigning world champion, also fared well.

'Bradley Wiggins could be a good example of the relationship between good looks and endurance. Or he may show you can still finish first without being attractive'

Unfortunately Tour de France winner 
Bradley Wiggins and fellow Britons Mark Cavendish and Chris Froome were 
excluded from the analysis.

Reasons for this included them wearing caps or sunglasses in the official team photos used – making it difficult for their looks to be scrutinised.

Dr Postma, of the University of Zurich, said: ‘I have heard mixed reports about the attractiveness of Bradley Wiggins.

‘He could be a good example of the relationship between good looks and endurance.  Or he may show you can still finish first without being attractive - that there is still hope for everyone.’
