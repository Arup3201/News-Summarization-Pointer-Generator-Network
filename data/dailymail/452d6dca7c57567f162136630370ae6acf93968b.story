Fall From Grace: Erica DePalo, 33, is the reigning 'Teach of the Year' in Essex County, New Jersey

A New Jersey 'Teacher of the Year' is under arrest over claims she had a summer affair with a teenage student.

Erica DePalo, 33, romanced a 15-year-old West Orange High School pupil from mid-June until just a week ago, according to police.

The honors English teacher is Essex County's reigning top teacher for the 2011-12 school year.

But she now faces first- and second-degree aggravated sexual assault charges, as well as a claim for endangering the welfare of a child.

The single woman from the town of Montclair is being held at a northern New Jersey lock-up in lieu of $100,000 bail.

'I don’t have any children,' DePalo remarked after winning her award, 'and I always say that I don’t have any children to go home and take care of.

'But every morning and every day that I go to school I have 110 children that are very near-and-dear to my heart.'

'The district has taken strong action by 
suspending the employee immediately and indefinitely,' Superintendent 
James O'Neill noted in a statement, adding that he plans to 'cooperate 
with the prosecutor's office in every way.'

Sacked: DePalo has been suspended indefinitely from her post as an honors English teacher after allegedly carrying on an affair with one the students in her class

The allegations belie DePalo's pedigree.

She graduated from Villanova - a Roman-Catholic college in Philadelphia - with an English degree, before continuing her studies at New York University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where she earned her master's in Liberal Studies.

Officials made counselors available at the high school following the arrest.

DePalo, who also reportedly coached the school's junior varsity tennis squad, has worked at West Orange High School since 2003. She earned the top-teacher honor as part of the state Department of Education’s 'New Jersey Teacher of the Year' program.

'I am merely a representative of all the hardworking dedicated teachers, especially those with whom I work at West Orange High School,' she said after winning the award, according to The Record of Bergen County.

She praised her colleagues as 'teachers who are committed to their students, who consistently advocate for their students, and who exceedingly go above and beyond their everyday duties and job descriptions.'

Her lawyer refused to comment.
