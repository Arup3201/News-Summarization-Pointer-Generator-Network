A New Hampshire man has been charged with punching his three-month-old son, with doctors saying the baby had 17 broken bones and skull fractures when he was admitted to hospital.

The baby is now in a medically-induced coma.

His father, Jose Orta-Santana, 25, of Newmarket, New Hampshire, was been remanded in custody on a $100,000 bond. 

He was charged with first- and second-degree assault.

Abusive: Jose Orta-Santana, 25, was charged with felony first- and second-degree assault on Thursday after allegedly punching his three-month-old son and causing 17 broken bones

Investigators say the boy was taken to a New Hampshire hospital on Saturday after suffering a seizure. 

He was then taken to a Boston hospital, where doctors found evidence of skull fractures and 17 broken bones.

Local media reports say Orta-Santana confessed that he punched his son in the head three times after becoming 'frustrated' with him.

Police are now investigating suspicions the child's injuries date back to when he was born. 

'This is probably the most serious child abuse case that we've dealt with in a long, long time,' Police Chief Kevin Cyr told WMUR 9.

'I've been a police officer 30 years, and this has got to be in the top two or three that I've ever seen.'

Police said Orta-Santana confessed he was frustrated with the baby  and punched him in the head three times

Court officials say Orta-Santana was not represented by a lawyer.
