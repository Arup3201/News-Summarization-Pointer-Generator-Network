Four Victorian thieves who forked out the cash to pay for their pizza order only to steal the store's delivery vehicle - and allegedly burn it - have been nabbed on CCTV.

The four men, described as Middle Eastern appearance in their early 20s, were filmed dancing inside the Victorian store after one of the men reached behind the counter and stole the keys to the delivery car.

The main offender, wearing a white shirt and backwards blue cap, can be seen plotting the getaway while staff have their back turned and are absent from shot.

Seconds into the video he reaches around the side of the counter where he appears to take the keys to the Suzuki delivery vehicle off the desk.

He is well aware that he is being filmed when he gestures directly to camera, before breaking into an impromptu dance on the store's floor.

In a fit of excitement about his friend's new acquisition to their getaway car, his friend then joins in and the man in the white shirt encourages his texting mate, who is sitting to down, to join them.

Police said the four men walk out to the parked Suzuki about 10pm, and drive off before allegedly ditching the car and burning it about midnight in the Victorian suburb of Craigieburn.

Police released the CCTV footage of the men dancing in the store, in a bid to identify the 'late teens or early 20s' who they said appeared to be of Middle Eastern appearance.
