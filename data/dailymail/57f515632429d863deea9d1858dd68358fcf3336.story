First Class Mail, the colt which carries the colours of the Daily Mail and Mail Online, will face 13 opponents when he lines up in the Adnams Copper House Gin Median Auction Maiden Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket on Friday (6.10). It will be his third start.

Apprentice Charlie Bishop, on board when First Class Mail was sixth on his Windsor debut, rides the chestnut son of Winker Watson again.

First Class Mail is making a quick reappearance after finishing fifth at Brighton last Thursday, a performance where he struggled to cope with the undulations of the Sussex course.

Among First Class Mailâ€™s opponents will be Home Of The Brave, who was over three lengths in front of him when second in the Windsor race.
