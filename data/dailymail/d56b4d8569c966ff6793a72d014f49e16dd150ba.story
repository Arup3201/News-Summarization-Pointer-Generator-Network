Farewell?: Reports say that Marc Jacobs will not renew his contract at Louis Vuitton

The chatter surrounding Marc Jacobs’s contract negotiations with parent company, LVMH, intensified on Monday with solid reports that he is poised to leave the helm of Louis Vuitton.

Women’s Wear Daily is reporting that Marc Jacobs is unlikely to renew his contract as creative director of Louis Vuitton. The move would allow him to focus his energies on his namesake labels.

Their article corroborates similar reports published by Reuters last week. It also substantiates longstanding rumors that former Balenciaga designer Nicolas Ghesquière could succeed Jacobs at Vuitton’s helm.

Jacobs--whose signature brand Marc 
Jacobs and diffusion label Marc by Marc Jacobs are also owned by 
LVMH--could be leaving Vuitton in order to take his personal businesses 
‘to the next level,’ writes the paper

Which
might mean, according to sources, that Jacobs could be eying an initial
public offering—placing him in the footsteps of his design contemporary
Michael Kors, whose business, following a 2011 IPO, now holds an 
approximate $15 billion market value.

Jacobs’s retail sales are now reportedly estimated in the billions.

In
the last sixteen years, Jacobs (who joined Louis Vuitton as creative 
director in 1997--the same time at which LVMH purchased a majority stake
in his own brand), has expanded the Vuitton brand from heritage luggage
purveyor to a massive commercial entity.

He
was tasked with starting the brand’s ready-to-wear business from 
scratch, as well as growing the label’s overall commercial popularity 
and cool quotient.

Jacobs’s ten-year contract at Louis 
Vuitton will reportedly end in the next few months. Fashion insiders 
expected the designer’s spring 2014 runway show, debuting on Wednesday, 
to be his last for the brand.

But
that might not be the case. WWD writes that Jacobs ‘could be tapped to 
do more Vuitton collections, including the fall show in March,’ in lieu 
of signing another lengthy contract—giving the brand enough time to 
negotiate employment terms with his successor.

Reinventing the wheel: Jacobs's tenure at Louis Vuitton is regarded for its collaborations with famous artists (like Steven Sprouse, above) who reinvented the brand's classic monogram

However,
they report that Wednesday’s show ‘could involve retrospective or 
archival elements,’ which could ‘provide a glance back at a fruitful 
collaboration that helped catapult Vuitton’s—and Jacobs’—global 
profile.’

Further reinforcing the fashion rumor mill, it is also being reported that Nicolas Ghesquière is indeed the front runner to replace Jacobs at Vuitton. Ghesquière’s potential appointment would follow a 15-year run as the lead designer at Balenciaga—a tenure that abruptly ended last year.

If appointed at Vuitton, Ghesquière would have some big shoes to fill.

In the last sixteen years, Jacobs steered the Vuitton brand through a variety of successful phases, the most fruitful of which was the brand’s obvious foothold in the ‘logo-mania’ trend of the early aughts.

Through collaborations with 
contemporary artists like Richard Prince and Takashi Murakami, Jacobs 
was able to reinvent the classic Vuitton monogram for a new, commercial 
audience. The artists’ colorful interpretations of Vuitton’s historic 
DNA earned the label a strong following in brand-conscious luxury 
markets like China and Japan. Both countries have accounted for a large 
portion of Vuitton’s global financial success.

Extra credit: Jacobs is credited with starting Louis Vuitton's ready-to-wear collection, which he fashioned into a sophisticated, taste making label (above, models walk the runway at the end of last season's Louis Vuitton show)

This
past spring Jacobs sat down in conversation with New York fashion 
influencer Fern Mallis as part of her discussion series at Manhattan’s 
92Y venue.

When prompted, he
glossed over the rumors already surrounding his Vuitton contract 
negotiations, and said that leaving Vuitton wouldn’t be an entirely bad 
thing as it would provide him extra time to spend with his new dog.

Not that Jacobs’s schedule would be completely unoccupied—he’d still preside over the aforementioned Marc Jacobs and Marc by Marc Jacobs brands, which expanded earlier this year to include cosmetic offerings.

Jacobs took the Vuitton 
responsibilities on at a time when designers (including Alexander 
McQueen and John Galliano) were eager to spread their influence and financial capabilities with 
lofty creative director jobs. But that expanded influence also took a 
toll on many designers’ time, patience, and sobriety.

Galliano recently explained in a Vanity 
Fair interview that the speed of the creative cycle at Christian Dior, 
as well as his John Galliano line, was the primary reason for his spiral
into alcohol and drug addiction.

Out of the box: Jacobs has brought a quirky, commercial edge to the Vuitton brand, which has incited a retail craze (above, people walk by a Vuitton boutique under construction in Shanghai)

Jacobs, too, has been hospitalized for drug addiction. He was last admitted to rehab in 2007, and has since adhered to a strict nutrition and exercise regimen to stay healthy.

Now, at 50 years old, may not be the worst time for him to get back to the basics.

His longtime business partner Robert Duffy recently admitted in an interview that the duo had begun to let the creative responsibilities of their Marc by Marc Jacobs line slide, accounting for its waning retail prominence. Duffy even said that the brand was ‘getting a little stale.’

‘We just let it go. We rested on our laurels and it hurt us,’ he said.

In the spring, they appointed quirky English designers Luella Bartley and Katie Hillier to reengineer the label—a time at which Duffy reasserted both he and Jacobs’s dedication for the label. Leaving Vuitton would allow them that focus.
