It may have started life as a joke, but the Goat Simulator has become a reality - and a popular one at that.

The game, in which players explore a virtual world through the eyes of the farmyard creature, is alive and literally kicking for Windows on Steam.

Its popularity has surprised many, and was closely followed by a Bear Simulator that achieved Kickstarter funding in less than a week.

As the name suggests, Goat Simulator is a third-person game in which players take control of a goat.

They can roam the game's virtual world, run, jump, and headbutt objects and people.

They can also lick items which stick to the goat's tongue and can be thrown.

It was developed by Swedish-based Coffee Stain Studios.

Although
 many people claimed the game was an April Fools joke, its developers said it is a serious game with bugs and glitches left in to make
 it feel 'light-hearted'.

Pre-orders for beta access cost $9.99 (£6).

But what makes these games so appealing?

Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) aren’t new. 

There have been various free and paid-for versions since late 1990s and early 2000s, but the majority involved human protagonists and were set in fantasy and medieval lands.  

These include last year’s Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, 2001’s Runescape and the hugely popular World of Warcraft, first released in 2004.

Although animal simulators have been around for years, they have been steadily rising in number and popularity for the past decade.

WolfQuest, pictured, was created by the Minnesota Zoo and game developer Eduweb in 2007. It was set up to help players understand wolves and the roles they play in nature by playing as a grey wolf. WolfQuest challenges players to learn about wolf ecology by living the life of a wild wolf in Yellowstone National Park

In March, Oregon-based Farajay Studios launched a Kickstarter campaign asking for funding for a Bear Simulator, pictured. It is a first-person game that lets players 'do bear things', including exploring, eating fish and plants and sleeping. The campaign hit its target funding within a week

A
 recent study found three quarters of people in a relationship with 
someone who regularly plays role-playing games wish their partner would 
pay them more attention.

Researchers
 from Brigham Young University discovered the amount of time it 
takes to play the games, as well as the development of virtual 
relationships, were blamed for break-ups.

Other players were found to have had affairs with people they'd met while playing the games. 

However, couples that played role-playing games together said it had strengthened their relationship. 

WolfQuest, for example, is a 3D simulation game created by the Minnesota Zoo and game developer Eduweb in 2007.

It was set up to help players 'understand wolves and the 
roles they play in nature' by playing as a grey wolf.

Enviro
 Bear 2000, released in 2009, lets players drive a car as a bear and is 
available for Windows as well as in the form of an Android app, called 
Enviro Bear 2010.

In 2011, Feral Heart was set up as a successor to Impressive Title – a game inspired by The Lion King film.

Developed by KovuLKD, players control a character, typically a lion or lioness, either in first or third person, as it hunts, explores and interacts with other members.

In January, a developer created a first-person simulator called Catlateral Damage in which players could explore a virtual house as a feline, and scored points for destroying the place.

And then in March, Oregon-based Farajay Studios launched a Kickstarter campaign asking for funding for a Bear Simulator. It hit its target funding of $29,500 (£17,700) within a week and its current figure is more than $69,200 (£41,600).

While
 traditional video games typically don’t involve taking on a new 
persona, RPGs tend to require a stronger emotional investment.

They
 encourage people to take on the role of a character, interact with 
other online characters and rarely have a set storyline, final scene or end point.

The persona that the player adopts is traditionally different to their real-world persona and lets them act in different ways.

The Catlateral Damage game, pictured, was created by Boston-based developer Chris Chung. It lets players roam around a virtual room as a cat

The aim of Catlateral Damage is to explore virtual rooms, swiping at objects using the cat's paw, pictured bottom, and destroying as many household items as possible. Players earn points for each item they destroy. To swipe at objects, players click the left and right mouse buttons

This has its pros and cons. For
 example, taking on the role of the opposite sex, or a person of a 
different age, has been found to increase empathy towards that type of person in 
real-life.

The games have 
also been known to improve spatial reasoning skills, particularly among 
female players, and the ability to make new friends.

They also help people developing strategy and critical-thinking skills.

Recreation therapist William Hawkes-Robinson said benefits include stronger reading skills, mathematics, creative thinking, cooperative play, and other creative skills.

He continued: 'There are very few social table-top recreation activities available that are cooperative rather than competitive in nature.

'Role-playing gaming is, by design, a cooperative past time, which in and of itself may have significant benefits in the world where everything is becoming competitive at all ages and levels of society.'

However, players can also become too involved in the game, and invest too much time emotionally to a character to the detriment of real relationships.

This can lead someone to feel isolated, or develop existing negative feelings such as low self-esteem

Role-playing games can additionally become addictive, due to the large amount of time and effort required to play many of the games.

As a result, many of the simulators - fantasy, animal, or otherwise - come with advice and guidance for parents.
