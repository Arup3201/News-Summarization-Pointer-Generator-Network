Hester Mottershead, 90, died from a stroke after a four-man gang ransacked her home in Wolverhampton - but noone was tried for her death

Serious questions have been raised over why a gipsy gang which ransacked the country home of a retired headmistresses minutes before she died from a stroke have not been prosecuted over her death. 

Hester Mottershead, 90, had frantically phoned 999 after four burglars dressed in blue boiler suits turned up at her £550,000 detached home in Tettenhall, Wolverhampton, claiming to be water board officials.

An inquest into Miss Mottershead's death heard how one of the men pretended to inspect her taps, as three others turned over her property, before fleeing with a haul of valuables.

But by the time officers arrived after the incident in August 2012, the elderly woman had collapsed and was rushed to hospital, where she died 24 hours later.

Police launched a murder inquiry and a string of specialists said the stroke was extremely likely to have been caused by the stress of the raid.

But, one year later, manslaughter charges against the four men were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service, due to an alleged lack of medical evidence. 

Instead, the gang - who lived on caravan sites in Warwickshire and Leicestershire - were jailed for burglary.

Black Country senior coroner Zafar Siddique has now questioned why the CPS dropped the charges relating to the 'absolute tragedy' of Miss Mottershead's death.

Speaking at Sandwell Coroners' Court on Tuesday at the inquest, Mr Siddique said he believed the actions of the gang had caused Miss Mottershead's fatal stroke 'on the balance of probability'.

Recording a narrative conclusion, he added: 'It's been suggested that cerebral haemorrhage may be triggered by acute stress response.

'However the scientific evidence cannot exclude the possibility that this was coincidental. On the balance of probability I would suggest it has been a contributing factor.

'I do share the disappointment with the officers about the charges that weren't pursued.' 

Mrs Mottershead's second cousin Peter also said he was 'disgusted' that the criminals had not been further pursued. 

Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Marsh, from West Midlands Police, had told the hearing how the CPS did not believe it could be proven beyond doubt the men were responsible for the death. 

The culprits were William Connors, 20, James Connors, 22, Gerry Connors, 20, and Michael Cash, 23.

She said: 'I believe we reached that threshold but we have to leave the decision to the CPS. It was their view and the view of counsel that the standard wasn't met.

'We were unable to get the authority to charge with manslaughter.

'That was because, in the view of the CPS, our medical evidence wasn't strong enough for a causal link to be established.'

But a range of different specialists, including the pathologist who carried out Miss Mottershead's post-mortem examination, concluded the stroke was extremely likely to have been brought on as a result of increased stress levels and blood pressure, in turn caused by the raid. 

After the hearing, the victim's 57-year-old cousin Peter Mottershead said he was 'disgusted' at the decision not to charge the men.

The warehouse worker, from Alveley, Shropshire, said: 'The sentences were miniscule. They could be doing it again.' 

The inquest also heard how the four men were among eight defendants who were sentenced for a string of raids carried out across the Midlands on the same day Miss Mottershead was targeted.

Elderly residents had been threatened with cricket bats and hockey sticks which had been stolen from previous raids, the hearing heard. 

Detective Chief Inspector Marsh said there was breakthrough in the case when officers linked up 12 separate incidents through the presence of a distinctive Audi.

She added: 'All four suspects I have mentioned today were found guilty or pleaded to the offences conspiracy to burgle and rob.

'All have been sentenced by Wolverhampton Court to sentences ranging between two to five years, which we were disappointed with.'  

Miss Mottershead was born in Lancashire and educated at St Anne’s College, Oxford, where she qualified with a first-class degree before training as a teacher.

She became headmistress of Bilston Girls’ High School in 1954, where she also taught Latin, until it was converted into a sixth form centre in 1975. The building has since been converted into flats.

In 1976 she became principal of Wolverhampton Girls’ High School, where former pupils remember her taking her pet corgi Iola into school with her. She retired in 1983.

Although Miss Mottershead lived alone, she bought and shared the £550,000 property with her friend and former Bilston deputy head Brenda Thompson, until Miss Thompson’s death in 2006.

In her will, she left £50,000 to Oxford University and £20,000 to New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton.

Large sums were also donated to local schools and charities including the RNLI and the Dogs' Trust. 

Mr Mottershead's mother Hazel, 89, said her late cousin 'was school, school, school' and had studied hard to win scholarships in her younger days.
