Secret: The husband of Anna Allison, pictured, who was killed on 9/11 visited Guantanamo Bay to try and save the lives of the Al-Qaeda terrorists behind the attack

The husband of a woman who was killed when her plane smashed into the World Trade Centre on 9/11 visited Guantanamo Bay to try and save the lives of the men suspected of being behind the attack.

Blake Allison, 62, held a secret hour-long meeting last week with the lawyers of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed and four of his accomplices.

Incredibly, during the extraordinary meeting he offered to testify in court against the death penalty being used against the men.

The wine-company executive is a vocal critic of capital punishment and said he wants the U.S government to spare the lives of the five men - even if they are convicted of a host of death-penalty charges.

Speaking to the New York Post, he said: 'The public needs to know there are family members out there who do not hold the view that these men should be put to death.

'We can’t kill our way to a peaceful tomorrow.'

He added: 'Just because I was hurt very badly and personally does not, in my mind, give me the go-ahead to take a life.'

Mr Allison's wife Anna, 48, was travelling to Los Angeles for work when the American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into Tower 1 at the World Trade Centre.

Mr Allison - from New Hampshire - has admitted his late wife's relatives or other victims' family members do not share his view.

He also says he believes Khalid Sheik
 Mohammed, Waleed bin Attash, Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi have no remorse and would commit the same atrocities 
again.

His meeting with the terrorists' lawyers took place on May 4.

Mr Allison, who has remarried, said despite opposing the death penalty, this does not mean he wants the men behind the devastating attack not to be brought to justice.

But he said he believes it is wrong to take a life.

He says he has been against the death penalty for decades, before his wife was murdered.

Mr Allison has also previously testified on behalf of 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.

He was the 20th hijacker who faced the death penalty but was instead sentenced to life in prison.

A total of 2,976 people were murdered during the day of attacks in 2001 after hijacked airliners were flown into New York’s World Trade Centre and the Pentagon in Washington.

The grieving relatives of 9/11 victims were left furious earlier this month when a preliminary hearing for the five men descended into farce.

The men deliberately disrupted what should have been a short hearing, dragging it out for 13 hours.

Proceedings were repeatedly interrupted as the men knelt in prayer, flicked through a copy of The Economist, refused to use headphones and insisted the 123 pages of charges they face were read aloud.

Their antics in a top-security military court in Guantanamo Bay were watched by the relatives, who had attended the court and watched live feeds at military bases in several U.S. cities.

Jim Riches, whose fireman son, Jimmy, died at the World Trade Centre, said: ‘It’s actually a joke, it feels ridiculous. It looks like it’s going to be a very long trial.’

Debra Burlingame, whose brother, Charles, was the pilot of the plane that flew into the Pentagon, added: ‘They’re engaging in jihad in a courtroom.

Khalid Sheik Mohammed is a Pakistani citizen who grew up in Kuwait and attended 
college in Greensboro, North Carolina.

He has acknowledged to military 
authorities that he was responsible for the September 11 attacks 'from A to 
Z,' as well as about 30 other plots, and that he personally killed Wall 
Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.

He was captured in 2003 in Pakistan.
  Ramzi Binalshibh is a Yemeni, who was allegedly 
chosen to be a hijacker but couldn't get a U.S. visa and ended up 
providing assistance such as finding flight schools.
  
Waleed bin Attash, also from Yemen, allegedly ran an Al Qaeda training 
camp in Afghanistan and researched flight simulators and timetables.
  Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi is a Saudi who allegedly helped 
the hijackers with money, Western clothing, travellers' cheques and credit
 cards.

Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali is a Pakistani national and nephew of Mohammed, who
 allegedly provided money to the hijackers.

'My brother was murdered in the cockpit of his airplane, and we will have to stand up for him.’

Eddie Bracken, from Staten Island, said he gone to Cuba to look straight at the accused terrorists. He lost his sister, a mother of two, who worked as a secretary on the 105th floor of the south tower.

As one of them, Binalshibh entered the court, he smiled at Mr Bracken and gave him a thumbs-up.

Mr Bracken told the accused: 'I came a long way to see you, eye to eye.'

It is the second attempt to prosecute the self-proclaimed mastermind of the atrocities, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and four others.

Mohammed, 47, who has admitted being the architect of the attacks, appeared in public for the first time in three years for the arraignment hearing – which will have to be held again so the defendants can enter pleas.

Mohammed is being tried alongside Waleed bin Attash, Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi.

If convicted, the men could face the death penalty but the trial is unlikely to take place for at least another 12 months.

At the arraignment hearing, the judge was deluged with questions about his qualifications to hear the case. There were also complaints that the accused were not allowed to wear clothes supplied by their lawyers.

Regular meal and prayer breaks further delayed proceedings and at one point all five men refused to take part and passed around a copy of The Economist magazine.

They ignored the judge, wouldn’t listen to Arabic translations over their headphones and asked for lengthy court documents to be read aloud, adding two hours to the case. 

Charged: Waleed Bin Attash, left, and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi are also suspected of carrying out the 9/11 attacks

Mohammed took off his earphones 
providing an Arabic translation and refused to answer questions or 
acknowledge he understood them before dozing off.

Bin Attash was locked to a restraint chair when he came into court and released only after he promised to behave.

The only defendant to break his silence was Binalshibh who prayed alongside his defence table before launching into a tirade in which he claimed to be in danger.

In a mixture of broken English and Arabic he compared the Guantanamo Bay commander to Colonel Gadaffi, the former Libyan dictator, and claimed that he had been threatened.
