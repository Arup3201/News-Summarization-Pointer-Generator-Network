Swansea are lining up a £5million offer for West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison.

Morrison, who has just 12 months left on his deal at Upton Park, is set to leave the east London club this summer.

And newly-appointed Swans boss Garry Monk has identified the England Under 21 international as a potential summer signing.

Impact: Morrison won a player of the month award while on loan at Loftus Road

Morrison spent the second half of last season on loan at QPR, helping Harry Redknapp’s side to promotion into the Premier League.

Rangers are interested in taking Morrison on a permanent basis, but Swansea are keen to steal a march on their rivals in the race to sign the talented midfielder.

Morrison was a key player for the Hammers during the first half of last season, but fell out of favour with Allardyce.

There is a willingness to re-integrate the former Manchester United youngster back into the first team fold at Upton Park.

But the club know they will have to sell Morrison this summer if he does not extend his deal to avoid losing him for nothing next summer.
