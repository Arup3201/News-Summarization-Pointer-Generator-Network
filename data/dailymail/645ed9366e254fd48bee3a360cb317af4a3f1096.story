A haggard-looking Bridget Kelly, the former Chris Christie deputy chief of staff whose emails and text messages launched the 'Bridgegate' scandal, appeared in a New Jersey courtroom as her lawyers sparred with prosecutors over whether she can use the Fifth Amendment to block document subpoenas.

Kelly arrived at the courthouse for her first public appearance since the national fascination with her part in the scandal began, appearing none too pleased to be there but resigned to her personal stake in the rulings that will likely determine her legal future.

Reid Schar, a prosecutor famous for 
putting Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich behind bars, argued Tuesday that 
his subpoenas aren't a 'fishing expedition' but demand specific records 
that a Democrat-dominated legislative committee knows exist.

The
 committee hired Schar in January to lead a probe into the state's 
Republican governor and his appointees, at least three of whom are 
linked to an apparent plot to snarl traffic in the New Jersey town of 
Fort Lee as payback for its mayor's failure to endorse Christie's 2013 
re-election bid.

Kelly and Bill Stepien, a former 
senior Christie campaign official, insist that the Fifth Amendment's 
right against self-incrimination should protect them from turning over 
documents that might point to their guilt in the alleged scheme.

Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson quizzed Schar on the former officials' legal argument that giving documents to Schar would be tantamount to testifying against themselves – something the Fifth Amendment says they can avoid.

'If that were true,' Schar responded, 'essentially every single subpoena would be open to the Fifth Amendment.'

Michael Critchley, Kelly's attorney, said Monday that she would show up personally in court, a step she didn't have to take. Kelly, famous for emailing Port Authority official David Wildstein that it was 'time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' was fired in January after Gov. Christie confronted her.

The governor has insisted that he had no knowledge of the September 2013 closures of lanes leading from the town to the iconic George Washington Bridge, beginning on the first day of school and lasting for five days.

More than a dozen figures in the Bridgegate debacle have already complied with subpoenas similar to those Kelly and Stepien have rebuffed.

But those two have held out, leading to speculation that they are angling for legal immunity.

Wildstein is also defying investigators, refusing to testify in a January hearing.

Schar argued Tuesday that he shouldn't have to promise he won't charge Kelly or Stepien with a crime in order to get emails, text messages and phone call logs that might describe her involvement in the plot.

The pugnacious Christie's approval numbers have dropped but he remains a viable 2016 presidential contender, aided by the direct, no-nonsense style that he brought to a town hall meeting with constituents on March 4

Stepien's lawyer, Kevin Marino, argued that the legislature's Democrats don't have the right to demand thousands of documents that they suspect might suggest his participation in a partisan attack on Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich.

But Schar told Judge Jacobson that emails already in his possession point to the existence of many others.

'I'm really sorry for causing you this much stress this close to November,' Stepien wrote in one email.

Marino read all five emails aloud in court, dismissing Schar's argument and saying they don't constitute 'reasonable particularized knowledge' or a 'foregone conclusion' – the legal standards – that more documents are waiting to be discovered.

Marino argued that the government's position is that 'we don't have any idea what exists, but we'd like you to tell us.'

Tuesday's hearing is crucial to New Jersey legislators' continuing investigation into the actions of Christie's staffers, because if Jacobson quashes the subpoenas, all three of the key Bridgegate figures will have blocked committee Democrats.
