A new mother infected by a flesh-eating virus is clinging to life following seven operations to try to save her.

Lana Kuykendall fell ill shortly after being released from hospital following the birth of her twins on May 7, being readmitted just 13 hours later.

The 36-year-old has been kept 'intubated and sedated' her brother said, at a hospital in Greenville since May 11, as she battles necrotizing fasciitis.

Torn away: Lana Kuykendall can't take care of her newborn twins because she is fighting for her life with a tube in her throat

The brother, Brian Swaffer, told CNN that the babies, Ian and Abigail, are doing well and are in the care of relatives, adding that their mother still has 'a long road ahead'.

'She does respond sometimes, you can see in her blood pressure,' he said. 'She has opened her eyes a little bit at times but that's about it.

'We don't know what the next day is going to bring, so we're just trusting the Lord. We're taking it one day at a time.'

The infection began as a small bruise on Kuykendall's leg, though it began growing rapidly -- about one quarter of an inch an hour. 

The mother from Upstate, South Carolina, is now in critical condition at a hospital in Greenville.

Mrs Kuykendall, 36, is the second woman in the South to contract a rare bacterial infection called necrotizing fasciitis, which can spread rapidly as it kills flesh. 

Aimee Copeland, 24, a graduate student at the University of Georgia, has last one leg, both her hands and her remaining foot after she was infected when she cut herself after falling from a homemade zip line.

On Monday her family was offered hope after she was taken of her ventilator and breathed on her own for the first time.

A third victim of the bacteria has been identified as 32-year-old Bobby Vaugh who became infected when he fell out of a tree and cut his side.

Early detection: Mrs Kuykendall quickly recognized something was wrong because she is a paramedic. Her husband, Darren, is a firefighter

Critical condition: Within 90 minutes of arriving at the hospital, doctors rushed Mrs Kuykendall into surgery to removed the infected tissue

Vaugh as lost two pounds of flesh from his groin and back since catching the aggressive bug. He went to the doctor after the infection site grew from the size of a peanut to that of a grapefruit and is recovering from five surgeries.

Mrs Kuykendall is a trained paramedic, who knew something bad had happened when she spotted the spot on her leg and began experiencing pain that wouldn't go away, the Greenville News reported.

She had been home from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she gave birth to Ian and Abigail, for just 13 hours.

Her husband took her to the hospital and within 90 minutes, she was in emergency surgery. Doctors removed the dead, infected flesh on her leg in the hopes that they could stop the bacteria from spreading.

Before she went into surgery, Mrs Kuykendall and her husband Darren watched in horror as the infection visibly spread throughout her leg.

'And the longer she sat there, the bigger that spot got. It was initially the size of a 3-by-5 index card. But it got bigger and bigger,' Mr Kuykendall, a firefighter, told the newspaper.

'It moved a quarter of an inch in half an hour. Then the high-risk OB physician had a suspicion of what it was.'

Mrs Kuykendall is currently in the intensive care unit of Greenville Memorial Hospital, breathing through a tube. And she's missing out on some of the most important early days of her newborns' lives.

'(We're) still in disbelief that here is my friend, who just had these two beautiful babies, and now she is intubated upstairs, and not able to enjoy the bonding experience, and enjoy the babies,' her friend Kayla Moon told MSNBC.
