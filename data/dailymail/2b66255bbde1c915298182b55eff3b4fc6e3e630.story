A Texas news reporter effortlessly rapped Blackalicious' lyrically complicated song 'Alphabet Aerobics' to warm up for a live broadcast.

In a common ritual for live news reporters, Kim Powell of NewsWest9 warmed up her vocal chords for a live shot. But Powell didn't settle for the standard sally-sells-seashells-by-the-sea-shore.

Instead, she went all out, tackling the tongue-twisting 'Alphabet Aerobics.'

Mic Drop! After she effortlessly executes the lyrics, Powell pretends to toss her microphone in the air as she says 'Mic drop!'

Though the Midland, Texas reporter stumbled a little, she delivered the lyrics perfectly in a YouTube video,  letting everyone know that 'artificial amateurs aren't at all amazing.'  

In the less than two-minute video, Powell sways to the beat as she delivers the lyrics.

At the end, Powell, proud of herself, pretends to toss her microphone in the air as she says 'Mic drop!'

Since its post on Sunday, the video has amassed more than 30,000 views on YouTube and has shown up on many news sites with commenters praising the reporter's flawless execution of the tough lyrics.

Powell isn't the first person to tackle the popular song though. 

Earlier this year, Daniel Radcliffe wowed the Tonight Show audience with his rendition of  'Alphabet Aerobics.' 

Accompanied by a band, Radcliffe delivered the song with Jimmy Fallon behind him holding signs of each letter of the alphabet to coincide with Radcliffe's words. 

Radcliffe received a standing ovation for his performance, but, lacking a full band and a famous stage, Powell's cover may have been the most impressive one yet.

(Now it's time for our wrap up.

Let's give it everything we've got.

Ready? Begin.)

 

Artificial amateurs, aren't at all amazing.

Analytically, I assault, animate things.

Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat.

Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding.

Casually create catastrophes, casualties,

cancelling cats got their canopies collapsing.

Detonate a dime of dank daily doin' dough

Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low.

Eatin' other editors with each and every energetic,

epileptic episode, elevated etiquette.

Furious, fat, fabulous, fantastic.

Flurries of funk felt feeding the fanatics.

Gift got great global goods gone glorious.

Gettin' godly in his game with the goriest.

Hit 'em high, hella height, historical.

Hey, holocaust hints hear 'em holler at your homeboy.

Imitators idolize, I intimidate.

In a instant, I'll rise in a irate state

Juiced on my jams like jheri curls jockin' joints.

Justly, it's just me, writin' my journals

Kindly, I'm kindling all kinds of ink on.

Karate-kick type Brits in my kingdom.

Let me live a long life, lyrically lesson's is

learned. Lame louses just lose to my livery.

My mind makes marvelous moves, masses

marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered.

N*ggas nap knowin' I'm nice naturally.

Knack, never lack, make noise nationally.

Operation, opposition, off, not optional.

Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals.

Perfected poem, powerful punchlines.

Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime.

Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's Quannum.

Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got, uh.

Really raw raps, rising up rapidly.

Riding the rushing radioactivity.

Super scientifical sound search sought.

Silencing super fire saps that are soft.

Tales ten-times talented, too tough.

Take that, challengers, get a tune up.

Universal, unique untouched.

Unadulterated, the raw uncut.

Verb vice lord victorious valid.

Violate vibes that are vain make 'em vanish.

Wow I'm all well, what a wise wordsmith. Just

weaving up words weeded up, I'm a workshift.

Xerox, my X-ray-diation holes extra large.

X-height (excite) letters, and xylophone tones.

Yellow back, yak mouth, young ones yaws.

Yesterday's lawn yards sell our yawn.

Zig-zag zombies, zoomin' to the zenith.

Zero in zen thoughts, overzealous rhyme ZEALOTS!

(Good, can you say it faster?)
