Amir Khan vows not to bite that hand that feeds him if Floyd Mayweather delivers on his promise of a place in the opposite corner for one of his mega-million-dollar super fights next year.

Britain’s would-be successor to the throne of the mythical dominion of the greatest pound-for-pound fighter in the world watched in the same dismay and disgust as the rest of us as Marcos Maidana sank his teeth into the Chinese puzzle of a genius for whom he could find no solution.

On the night the spectre of Luis Suarez moved from the World Cup playing field to the Las Vegas Strip, Khan made no bones about what the punishment should be for any sportsman who resorts to such cannibal desperation.

He said: ‘When you do that you should never be allowed in the boxing ring again, because you’re risking someone’s life.’

Khan held out his clenched fists and said: ‘These are our tools and we need them (to survive).’

By distasteful – in every sense - irony, Khan was sitting next to the villain and the victim of the ring’s most infamous biting incident. 

When Mike Tyson gnawed a chunk out of Evander Holyfield’s ear he was pilloried for defacing not only his heavyweight nemesis but the hard old game itself - and Khan knows that boxing will be damaged by Maidana’s aberration.

He says: ‘It shames the sport. Getting frustrated can happen to anyone but this is not the way to deal with it. I’m mentally strong and I would never do anything like that. It’s just wrong. It is important to respect your sport and each other.’

It is also gruesome ingratitude for being given the chance to make a small fortune.

While others more deserving – notably Khan and Manny Pacquiao – are kept interminably waiting, Maidana has been granted two of these Maweather opportunities for wealth and fame within four months.

Each time he has discovered that being the Raging Bull from the Argentine pampas is not enough to unseat he who is both maestro of self defence and magical conjuror of the counter-attack.

Despite being some five million dollars better off after attending this pair of master classes, Maidana is in denial.

‘No, no,’ he protested, despite being shown he video of him chomping away. ‘I didn’t bite him.’ But it was also reminiscent of Suarez, another South American with cannibal tendencies as he had added: ‘Maybe he put his glove in mouth. Perhaps he thinks I’m a dog.’

Mayweather had no doubts about what was done to his left hand in the eighth round at the MGM Grand Garden Arena: ‘At first I didn’t know what had happened. Then I realised that he bit me.

Three of my fingers went numb. One of them busted open where he bit me through the glove. I couldn’t feel those fingers for the rest of the fight and could only use the other hand properly.’

Referee Kenny Bayless found for Mayweather, issuing dire warnings to the Maidana corner before he allowed the fight to continue.

Bayless also deducted a point from Maidana for twice throwing Mayweather to the canvas in a manner more befitting a wrestling match.

Even so Maidana took issue with the three other officials, saying: ‘I won the fight but if the judges want to give it to the man who ran away then good luck to them.’

For what it’s worth, my card concurred with the two who scored Mayweather the winner by 116 points to 111. The other made it 115-12.

It may even be that we all short-changed an artist who confounded those who feared that his legs were aging and his reflexes slowing.

Muhammad Ali would have been proud of some of his footwork, while his elusive head and body movement kept Maidana missing like a drunk in a bar brawl.

Khan did not see it that way, saying: ‘Floyd is looking older and he is slowing down. I don’t want just to fight him for the money, I want to beat him. My speed would do for him now.’

Mayweather’s Saturday night victory keeps alive the hope of Khan being given the chance to go for a place in history as the first to beat the Money man, who said; ‘He’s competitive and a good fighter so let’s see if it can happen.’

Even more importantly in the eyes of the wider world, it revives the possibility of Mayweather finally meeting Manny Pacquiao in a long-awaited $300 million fight of the century.

Mayweather said: ‘I’ll talk to my team about what the future holds and if a Pacquiao fight can be done let’s make it happen.’

Given his past reluctance to so much as mention the PacMan by name, this is cause for optimism that the obstacles dividing promoters and television companies can be overcome.

Quite when that might be is unclear.

The arduous preparations for fights of this magnitude take their toll of a 37-year-old and Mayweather hinted that he may pass on his next proposed date – next May – and give his body a full year to recover. ‘There’s no rush, is there?’ he asked his Showtime television paymasters.

Not for himself economically as he prepares to pocket at least $32 million from this fourth instalment of a six-fight contract with that pay-per-view network worth a minimum of $250 million in total.

Mayweather’s independence as well as Mexico’s was celebrated this holiday weekend by the 47th victory of his illustrious, still undefeated career.

It was achieved by bewildering Maidana and then punishing him for those wild misses with a whole variety of laser-accurate punches – the more debilitating of them to the body - which became more wounding as the 12 rounds unfolded.

So bemused was the challenger for all those welterweight and light-middleweight belts which were on the line that twice at the end of rounds Maidana wandered off towards the wrong corner.

On the second occasion Mayweather turned back to redirect him, like a traffic cop. That was a first for me in all these years covering boxers and the champion was amused: ‘Boxing’s a hard business but it’s important to keep a sense of humour.’

The joke was lost on Maidana.

But then this is not just sport’s year of the biter……..but of the biter well and truly bit.
