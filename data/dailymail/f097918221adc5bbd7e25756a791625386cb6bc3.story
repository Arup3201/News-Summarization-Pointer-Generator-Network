Off the road: Football icon Patrick Vieira tried to escape a driving ban by claiming he and other Premier League stars living in an upmarket village weren't getting their post. The star is pictured leaving court after being banned from driving

Football icon Patrick Vieira tried to escape a driving ban by claiming he and other Premier League stars living in an upmarket village were not getting their post.

The former Arsenal and Manchester City star was caught doing 61mph in a 50mph zone on the M60 near Stockport in his Bentley Continental Supersports.

The World Cup winner admitted he had been driving the £160,000 supercar at the time. But he said he did not receive the original prosecution notice at his £2.2 million home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire.

His lawyer claimed that should have rendered the case null and void. 

Vieira, 36, said he and other City players living nearby - including Sergio Aguero, Adam Johnson and Emmanuel Adebayor - often had mail delivered to the wrong house.

But magistrates in Stockport booted out his defence - and banned him for six months, with a £1,000 fine.

The punishment was suspended after he lodged an appeal.

Vieira already had nine points on his licence after being caught speeding three times in less than four weeks in September 2009.

The former France international, who still works for City, claimed he only knew of the speeding case after receiving a final notice on December 15 - six weeks after the initial letter was sent out on November 3.

His solicitor, Gwyn Lewis, said that meant a 14-day time limit to start legal proceedings had been breached.

Vieira said he and other City players and staff living nearby in the millionaires’ row were often forced to deliver each other’s post because of Royal Mail mix-ups.

He said: 'We have lived there for around two years and we’ve had things go to the wrong address three or four times.

'Often the neighbours would have to bring round my mail. I had Adam Johnson, David Platt, (Sergio) Aguero and (Emmanuel) Adebayor all living next door and we all had similar problems.

'Just last week my wife was supposed to receive a box of shoes from the U.S but we didn’t receive anything.'

When asked by Mr Lewis whether it was 
possible a fan had taken the notice of prosecution, Vieira said: 'Yes, 
especially in Manchester and especially in Alderley Edge as you have 
lots of Man City, Man United and Blackburn players so it’s often quite a
busy area.

'It can be possible for someone to put their hand inside [the letterbox] but I have no guarantees that’s what happened.'

Mr Lewis added: 'Most of us don’t have people outside our houses wanting a piece of memorabilia and that is a theoretical possibility.

'What I can tell you for definite is that Mr Vieira did not receive that letter.'

Vieira, who played 48 times for City between 2009 and 2011 and currently works as the club’s Football Development Executive, said he didn’t know how to deal with the threat of legal action and had put the matter straight into the hands of club bosses.

He said: 'I was quite scared when I saw it was a final notice, I didn’t know what was going on.

'Working for Manchester City we have a department which if we have any problems, they deal with that situation.

'I’m not used to dealing with these situations so I took it to the department because I know when a letter says something is a final notice it is serious.'

The village of Alderley Edge is situated in Cheshire and is a mecca for the rich and famous of the north west.

Lying 12 miles south of Manchester, the area - which has a population of 4,409 - is known for its expensive houses and affluence.

It is one of the most sought-after places to live in the UK outside of central London.

With its section of cafes and designer shops, it is a natural haven for Premier League footballers, actors and businessmen.

People who live or have lived in the village include:
