Ashley wears Rose Gold Saturn Ring earrings £119, Pink lambskin bracelet £59, Pink pearl bracelet £119, Rose gold plated steel chain bracelet £95, Charms from £29, Stacker rings from £39

'I got introduced to STORY at an event last year and 
completely fell in love with the collection,'  Ashley says.

'I'm a real magpie when it 
comes to jewellery and doing a lot of presenting means that the right 
accessories are high on the agenda for me when putting an outfit 
together.

'What is great about the STORY collection is that it is totally
 unique, allowing you to adapt each piece according to style and 
occasion.'

'I love the new ring stacking trend and adding one to 
every finger can add a real edge to an outfit.

Stacker rings from £39, Drop earrings £119, Saturn ring charm £69, White lambskin bracelet £59, Black snakeskin bracelet £95

'For me, STORY's wrap 
around bracelets also add colour, glamour and texture to your look and 
can easily adapt an outfit from day into night... essential when I am 
running from one event to another.

'The watch elements are incredible
 and can intertwine with different materials and charms to create a 
truly unique style. They also help to make sure I never miss my call 
time!'

Ashley isn't the first to be wooed by STORY's Nineties-inspired yet ultra-modern jewels.

The brand boasts a strong celebrity following with A-list fans including Cara 
Delevingne and Millie 
Manderson.

Brought to fame by her time on the Channel 4 show, Ashley remains in front of the camera 
presenting and interviewing fashion elite on Fashion TV, at X Factor and the Clothes 
Show Live.

With her striking bone structure, piercing blue eyes, and 
golden locks, her modelling career is also going from strength to 
strength.

Ashley continues living an A-list life and was spotted basking in the Californian sunshine on a girls holiday with former Hollyoaks star Wallis Day a few weeks ago, and is frequently papped at showbiz events.
