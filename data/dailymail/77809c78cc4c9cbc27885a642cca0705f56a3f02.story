An Indiana mother has recalled the horrific moment she realized she couldn't get to her 11 month-old son quick enough to stop a television falling and crushing him to death.

Nakita Jones' son Demetrius passed away last week in Indianapolis despite the best efforts of a passing police officer to keep the child alive with CPR.

'When I turned around I saw him fall and the TV fell on him and then it bounced off. You know, it all happened so fast,' she said.

Jones told Wishtv that she fondly recalls her child's sweet demeanor.

'Oh man he was a happy baby. He was a sweet baby, sweet baby and he was a handsome son,' Jones remembered.

In the immediate aftermath of the accident, Jones said that she rushed her child outisde to try and get help - and meet Detective David Miller.

'It meant so much, because no telling how long it would have taken the ambulance to get there. He was gone for that minute, but he gave him CPR and brought him back,' said Jones.

'David Miller, IMPD, I thank you, I thank you, I thank you,' said Darlene Jones, Demetrius’ grandmother.

The family said Miller gave them extra time with their baby and that was very important.

'He held on, he held on as long as he could. He held on enough to be able to know that he was loved while he was in the hospital. To hear our voices, to feel us,' said his mother.

Friends have set up a GoFundMe campaign to help Jones cover funeral expenses. To donate, click here.
