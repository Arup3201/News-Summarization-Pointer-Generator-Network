Northern Ireland are relishing a rare chance to focus on attack against the Faroe Islands, according to manager Michael O'Neill.

O'Neill's side do not go into many matches with a heavy expectation of victory but Saturday's home clash against a side ranked 179th in the world, nestling neatly between Chinese Taipei and the Turks & Caicos Islands, is one such occasion.

Expectations are even loftier given last month's impressive 2-1 away win over Hungary in their first Euro 2016 qualifier, but O'Neill accepts this will be a much different challenge.

He will ask, as always, for defensive rigour and tactical discipline but has tailored this week's training sessions firmly towards breaking down the opposition rather than holding them off at the other end.

And it is a shift in emphasis that has gone down well in the squad.

'There has been a lot of focus on our attacking play especially, our approach has been slightly different,' he said.

'Obviously when you are doing attacking play the players enjoy it more than the other side of the game so it's been a really good week. The mood in the camp is excellent.

'We anticipate having more possession than we have had in our recent away games and given that we will have more possession we hope to turn that into opportunities.

'You just can't go out and play off the cuff and play in a cavalier fashion. But our attacking players often have to do a lot of work off the ball. This is an opportunity to show the other side to their game.'

The game also represents a first home fixture for Northern Ireland in 13 months, during which time O'Neill's squad have played eight successive away games and racked up 34,000 air miles.

Home comforts may be hard to come by at Windsor Park though, with two stands having been demolished as part of the ongoing redevelopment.

Capacity has been reduced to 10,500 as a result but O'Neill is more interested in the new and improved playing surface.

'The pitch is always the priority for me. It's great. The surroundings pale into insignificance if I'm honest and I think the players certainly enjoyed the training on it,' he said.

'I don't think the surroundings will be a huge factor on the game. Once the game starts I think the players will be focused on what is going on on the pitch.

'I still think there will be a great atmosphere. The stadium is sold out and the backing of the fans will be huge for us on a night when the expectation is higher than it has been and we have to rise to that.'

Northern Ireland conspicuously failed to put away the lower ranked sides in World Cup qualifying, taking a miserable two points from 12 against Luxembourg and Azerbaijan.

A 4-0 win against the Faroes on their last visit to Belfast in 2011 offers more reason for cheer, but O'Neill is not focused on past results.

'I don't think we can dwell on that,' he said. 'If you go back down the years there is always different groups of players and they know none of these games are straightforward.

'We have to play as well as we did in Budapest and with the same intensity and quality.'

And captain Steven Davis also expects the side to learn from the mistakes of the past by beating the Faroe Islands on Saturday.  

'I think we need to learn from the mistakes we have made in the past in games like this because we know we are capable of getting a result,' he said.

'I think we have to be disciplined. I think in the past we have got a bit ragged and lost our way so it's about using that experience and putting it into practice.

'I don't think it is a case of not being able to cope with it (being favourite). Players are playing at clubs where there is expectation placed on them all the time.

'It is all about showing that and there is a real determination in the squad to get the three points.

'It won't be easy but if we don't come off with three points we will feel as if we have failed and we don't want that to happen.'

Davis admitted to watching England brush aside San Marino 5-0 on Thursday night as inspiration for the task ahead, but he realises the Faroes will expect to be more competitive than that in Belfast and is not expecting a similar goal-rush.

'I saw the majority of the England game and you can see at this level you will always come up against a team who are well organised,' he said.

'We expect the Faroes to be disciplined and I'm sure they will see this as an opportunity to get something as well, judging by their past results against some of the smaller nations.

'We aren't good enough to get carried away. We know our limitations and we know how we need to play and the effort we need to put in to get results, no matter who that is against. We need to be at it every game and get a bit of luck along the way.'
