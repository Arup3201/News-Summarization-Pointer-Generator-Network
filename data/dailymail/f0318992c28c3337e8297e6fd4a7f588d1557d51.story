Online love scammers have stolen more than $25 million from Australians in just one year, prompting the consumer watchdog to join forces with government anti-money laundering agents in a bid to crack down.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will start sending about 400 letters every fortnight to suspected victims of online dating scams with warnings to stop sending money.

Recipients will be identified if suspicious cross-border money movements are flagged with anti-money laundering agents as part of the new scam distribution project.

Online love scammers have stolen more than $25 million from Australians in just one year, prompting the consumer watchdog to join forces with government anti-money laundering agents

There was a staggering $89 million in financial losses from scams last year, with dating and romance topping the list at more than $25 million, the ACCC found.

There were close to 3,000 reports of relationship scams in 2013, with one third of people losing more than $10,000. 

ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said the aim was to disrupt the scam and therefore remove victims from scammers’ insidious clutches.

'Scammers invest considerable time and effort deceiving you into a fake romance, a fraudulent business partnership or a complex investment scheme. Their ultimate aim is to build your trust so they can steal your personal details and money,' she said.

'Victims of relationship scams often don’t know they’re a victim until it’s too late and their money is gone forever.'

ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said the aim was to disrupt the scam and therefore remove victims from scammers' insidious clutches

 1. You’ve never met or seen them: scammers will say anything to avoid a ‘face-to-face’ meeting.

2.  They’re not who they appear to be: scammers steal photos and profiles from real people to create an appealing facade.

3.  They ask to chat with you privately: as many dating sites have processes in place to identify and remove scammers,

4. You don’t know a lot about them: scammers are often less forthcoming about themselves.

5. They ask you for money:  once the connection’s been made - scammers will eventually ask you to transfer money.

Raising awareness has been touted as the key to helping Australians protect themselves better, which is another important aspect of the project.

'People should be particularly vigilant in asking themselves who they are really dealing with when they meet the person online,' Ms Rickard said.

'Scammers use the internet to establish relationships behind a smoke screen, where they remain anonymous while connecting with potential victims around the globe.

'Alarm bells should go off if they request money, especially via wire transfer. This payment method is popular with scammers as it is almost impossible to trace and it is rare to recover money sent this way.

'If you suspect that you, a friend or a family member is being targeted by a scammer, the ACCC strongly urges you to stop sending any money and to contact us.'

An Australian grandmother, whose online friendship cost her more than her lifesavings, met a tragic fate at the hands of a love scammer.

Jette Jacobs flew to South Africa believing she was starting a new relationship with a 28-year-old man, but days after meeting him she was found dead in her apartment, 60 Minutes reported. 

The ACCC said it was working with state and federal counterparts on the project through the Australasian Consumer Fraud Taskforce.

The taskforce comprises of 23 government regulatory agencies and departments with responsibility for consumer protection regarding frauds and scams.
