MK Dons manager Karl Robinson insists he is going nowhere after confirming interest in his services from Sky Bet Championship side Birmingham.

The League One Dons are loathe to lose Robinson and rejected an approach from Blues to speak to him about replacing Lee Clark, who left the Midlands club on Monday.

Speaking after his side's 2-1 win at Fleetwood, which lifted the Dons up to fourth in the standings, Robinson confirmed he knew of the interest but was unwilling to go into details.

Birmingham's attempts to land MK Dons boss Karl Robinson as their new manager were blocked by the club

He said: 'I believe there's been an approach but it's not something for me to get involved in.

'One thing I can say is that it's come as a shock and I think everyone has conducted themselves wonderfully well.

'I don't know how it's got out but it's something that has got into the public domain, although my agent found out about it by reading it.

'It's happened and the chairman said 'no' and we move on. I'm flattered by their approach but I'm just as flattered by the chairman's response.'

Robinson said he was flattered by the interest but is fully committed to MK Dons, who are fourth in League One

Lee Clark was dismissed from the Birmingham hotseat on Monday after a poor start to the season

Clark had been manager since June 2012 but had won just once at home in the league in a year and the club acted, with the former Huddersfield boss under pressure from fans.

Owen Coyle, Mike Phelan and Burton boss Gary Rowett have been linked to the job, with Birmingham 21st in the Championship.

Chief scout Malcolm Crosby and first team coach Richard Beale were put in charge for Tuesday's trip to Blackburn, which Blues lost 1-0.
