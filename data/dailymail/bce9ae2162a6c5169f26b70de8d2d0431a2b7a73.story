Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has been named Belgian Sportsman of the Year.

The 22-year-old became the first footballer to win the award, which has been running since 1967, after claiming the La Liga title during his loan spell with Atletico Madrid last season.

Courtois also played in goal during Belgium's progression to the quarter-finals in Brazil, the country's first World Cup appearance since 2002.

The Blues keeper returned to Stamford Bridge this season and has kept five clean sheets in 14 Premier League games to leave Chelsea three points clear at the top of the table ahead of the festive fixtures.

Courtois beat his Chelsea team-mate Eden Hazard, who finished fifth in the voting, and Kevin de Bruyne (eighth) as the other two footballers on the shortlist. 

Meanwhile, Chelsea's former No 1 Petr Cech - who replaced the injured Courtois in goal for Saturday's 2-0 victory over  Hull - insists Jose Mourinho's current crop has 'huge potential'.

'We only judge the team when the season is finished and you can see how many trophies the team has in hand,' the 32-year-old told the official club website, www.chelseafc.com.

'It is difficult to say which Chelsea side in history was the best because a lot of them won trophies.

'This team has huge potential, it has been doing really well this season, we are top of the league and have been doing some brilliant games but we are empty-handed at the moment, and I don't like to compare the teams until the season is finished.'
