A father of two who married his girlfriend in hospital after being diagnosed with terminal cancer just before Christmas has died less than a month after the wedding.

Felix Glenny, 23, married his partner, Cola Weller, on 20 December after doctors told him that the pains that were initially diagnosed as stomach cramps were symptoms of advanced bowel cancer and there was nothing they could do.

Mr Glenny, who was diagnosed on his son, Ralph's, second birthday, and who also has a five-month-old daughter, Pearl, died in Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent on Saturday night from the same disease that killed his mother and grandfather.

Today, his 22-year-old widow from Lower Stoke, near Rochester, told MailOnline: 'I feel happy knowing he is in the safe arms of his mum, and the children and I have gained a guardian angel.'

Mr Glenny, who worked for a water supply company, had suffered stomach pains for weeks and was initially told he had various ailments including a kidney infection, irritable bowels and a sickness bug.

But on 11 November he was admitted to hospital after a surgeon found a large tumour in his bowel, and days before Christmas doctors told him he had weeks to live.

Mr Glenny and his fiancee married in an emotional bedside ceremony with son Ralph as a pageboy.

Senior hospital chaplain, the Reverend Steve 
Spencer, blessed the marriage and led prayers for the couple’s two small children.

Speaking after the wedding, Mrs Glenny said: 'When we found out the cancer was terminal we just wanted to do it straight away.

'It was a really amazing day, I had a lot of fun. It was crazy because we were really happy, but it was so emotional.

The Glennys got married in Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent, where Mr Glenny was admitted in November

'It was a lovely day and we’ve been thinking about it ever since, it was just perfect.

'I was so glad he managed to get out of bed for it, it was great to see our family and friends so happy for us.'

After Mr Glenny's story was published, well-wishers - including X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne - joined a fund-raising campaign to make sure his children would be provided for after his death.

Mrs Osbourne, 61, herself a cancer survivor, donated £10,000 and sent a message telling the Glennys: 'Never give up the fight and hope.'

People, many of them strangers and some from as far afield as Australia, donated £48,000 in just a couple of days and the total fund now stands at more than £58,000.

Mr Glenny's best friend Ashley Clark, who set up the fund-raising campaign to help support his friend's young family, announced his death at the weekend.

He said: 'When I first saw Felix in hospital, money was all he seemed to be worried about, so hopefully I have taken that worry away.'

Mrs Glenny said: 'It has really put my mind at rest because I know I can look after my children now and I know this is what he wanted.

'I’m
 so grateful to everyone that’s donated, it’s made a real difference to 
our lives and our future. To get a donation from Sharon Osbourne herself
 is incredible.

'It’s a huge amount and it really will change our lives.'

Friend Lisa Crowther wrote an online tribute to Mr Glenny, saying: 'RIP Felix, thinking of your family and friends at such a sad time xx'.

And Charlotte Brown wrote: 'Breaks my heart to even begin to imagine
 what Cola and the family are going through, let the angels look after 
fee, in a world free from pain xxx'.

Mr Glenny's mother died of bowel cancer three years ago aged 41, and his grandfather died of the disease last year.
