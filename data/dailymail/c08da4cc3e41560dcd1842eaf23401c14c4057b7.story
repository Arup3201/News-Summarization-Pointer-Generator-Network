Some married couples argue when one partner hogs the duvet.

When David Rayner goes to bed, he has to fight for space with his wife Caroline's 400 cuddly toys.

Mrs Rayner, 27, began collecting Disney memorabilia at the age of three when she bought a Mickey Mouse doll in California.

Fanatic: Caroline Rayner, 27, has a collection of more than 400 Disney toys, worth £5,000

It triggered a lifelong obsession and her favourite toys were even in attendance at the couple's wedding reception.

The toys take pride of place in the Rayners' bedroom in Bromley, Kent, and Mr Rayner, 30, has to jostle for room in the bed.

Mrs Rayner, a retail sales assistant, 
said: 'I brought my first toy almost 24 years ago, a Mickey Mouse doll 
from America, and I fell in love with it.

'I was the victim of bullying when I was at secondary school so to make myself feel better I would go out and buy some more toys, and that’s when my collection really began to grow.'

Mrs Rayner's collection is worth £5,000 and includes a 4ft toy of Jungle Book character Baloo.

Her favourite toy is a Bolt teddy bear.

Mrs Rayner was worried that her collection would put off her future husband when she first showed him her bedroom.

'When I first took David back to my house I was worried about what he might think about my collection,' she said.

'I took a deep breath when I opened the door but to my surprise he didn’t seem that bothered. In fact, he actually embraced it.'

Mr Rayner now helps his wife of two years expand her collection by scouring local car boot sales and internet site eBay.

Mrs
Rayner, a keen artist, added: 'When we went on dates David would treat 
me to a Disney toy or figurine instead of bringing flowers or 
chocolates.

'I was so relieved that he didn’t mind my collection. He’s often off hunting down little treasures for me now.'

Mr Rayner did put his foot down when the couple married in 2010, banning Disney from the wedding ceremony.

But Mrs Rayner organised a 
Disney-themed reception complete with Disney music, balloons and cake - 
and their honeymoon was spent at Disneyland Florida.

She said: 'I wasn’t allowed any of my memorabilia at the ceremony but I made sure that the reception had a Disney theme.

'We listened to Disney music and we had some Disney balloons with a cake that had Mickey and Minnie Mouse on.

'Some of my soft toys were even sat on the side at the reception.'

After the reception we jetted off to Disneyland Florida for our honeymoon, which was a dream come true.'

Fascination: Caroline Rayner feared that her husband would be put off when he first saw the collection, but he scours car boot sales to help her add to it

Mrs Rayner is in pursuit of the world
record for Disney collecting - currently held by American Mary Brooks, 
who has over 1,411 different objects related to Donald Duck.

She said: 'One day I will be a world record holder with my impressive collection.

'I
would be so upset if anything happened to my collection but it wouldn’t
stop me for long as I would just start collecting again straight away.'

collecting
