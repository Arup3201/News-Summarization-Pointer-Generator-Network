A man has been charged with aggravated murder and robbery after four men were found beaten to death in separate homes in a small Ohio town.

The multiple homicides have shocked the small 12,000-strong community of Bucyrus, Ohio, with residents fearing it could be related to the town's drug problems.

Friends and relatives said at least some of the victims knew each other as well as a man taken into custody - Donald Hoffman - who had entered the police station to give information which led to the discovery of two bodies.

While police have not yet confirmed the charges, jail records showed Hoffman had been charged with four counts of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery, the Columbus Dispatch reported. 

The bodies of Billy Jack Chatman, 55, and Freelin Hensley, 67, were found Monday, while Darrell Lewis and Gerald Lee Smith, both 65, were found the following day.

Crawford County Coroner Michael Johnson said the cause of death hadn't yet been determined, but a preliminary autopsy report would soon be available. 

He said authorities believed the slayings were related 'because of the sequence and time, and appearance of the scene.'

Bucyrus police Chief Dave Koepke said each of the four men suffered trauma above the shoulders.

He said: 'All the victims suffered.'

Crawford County Sheriff Scott Kent said yesterday that a man - believed to be Hoffman - walked into the local police station to give information as to why the killings occurred.

However, he would not release the details of what was said.

He said: 'One (slaying) can be complicated. Four is overwhelming.'

Last night prosecutor Matthew Crall's office said 41-year old Hoffman, of Bucyrus, was in custody and described him as a person of interest in the slayings.

The office said in a news release that Hoffman was being held on a probation violation and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for him on this morning.

It wasn't immediately clear whether Hoffman had an attorney.

Calls to the Crawford County Jail on Wednesday night went to an automated answering service.

The town of 12,000 is unaccustomed to violent crime but is battling a heroin problem.

Some residents said after the slayings that they were worried about their safety.

Neighbors of some of the victims said they were reluctant to talk publicly about the men because they worried the case is somehow connected to the city's drug problems and feared potential retribution.
