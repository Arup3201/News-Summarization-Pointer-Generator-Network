Britain has been battered by extreme high tides triggered by the solar eclipse with many parts of the UK threatened by flooding.

But the 'supertide of the century' has been good news for surfers and more than 40 turned out to catch a rare 6ft high wave on the River Severn known as a bore. 

At least seven flood warnings were issued today by the Environment Agency along with 34 alerts across the country suggesting immediate action to protect properties.

The Thames Barrier was closed today for the 175th time in its 30-year history to protect London from the high tides linked to yesterday's solar eclipse and 'supermoon' which has caused rising water levels.

Flooding of homes and businesses is expected in North Tyneside and Sunderland as well as the Somerset coast and the Wye Estuary at Brockweir.

High tides have been forecast for the next two days, according to data by the National Tidal and Sea Level Facility. 

Tides will be 2.5m higher than other times in Milford Haven, south Wales, 1.5m higher in Plymouth, Devon, and the Isle of Mull, western Scotland, and 0.5m higher in London on the tidal Thames.

Flood alerts were  issued for parts of Teddington and Twickenham as well as the River Avon and Devon coast. 

An EA spokesman said: 'These are spring tides, and higher due to the moon's 18-year cycle. High tides may lead to spray on promenades.'

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency said: 'Spring tides are expected. There may be high waves.' 

A Severn bore tidal wave ranked a maximum level five today and a level four wave has been predicted for the next two days.

The phenomenon is one of only three expected this year, with the first last month and the third expected later in the year

The bore, caused by a 'super tide' which hits the flow of the river, arrived at Newnham-on-Seven, Gloucester at 7.33am and surfers rode it upriver for several minutes

It arrived at Newnham-on-Seven, Gloucester at 7.33am and surfers rode it upriver for several minutes.

The bore, caused by a 'super tide' which hits the flow of the river, did not last long, but it left fans and photographers delighted.

Photographer Clive Mowforth, 58, said: 'It was very crowded. It was certainly more crowded than last month.

It was lovely and sunny this morning. Everyone had a great time. There was probably about 40 people there.

'Some of them had a good ride. Inevitably, it didn't last very long.'

Forecasters did not predict any major rainfall over the next few days, but said there could be outbreaks in the South East and Northern parts of Scotland.

The Met Office said the first week of Easter holidays, which begin on Friday, will see highs of 10C and a mix of clear spells and showers or persistent rain. 

Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite said: 'Conditions will feel quite cold from Monday due to brisk north-westerly winds bringing polar maritime air from Iceland's direction.

'Sleet could fall in Dartmoor, with snow on the highest Pennines, Cumbrian fells and north Wales mountains, and over 500m in Scotland.

'Temperatures will generally be below average with some frosty nights. Nights could see down to -2C in England's North and Scotland.

'Temperatures will return to nearer normal by Thursday. Into the weekend and next week see a mixture of sunshine, showers, one or two persistent rainbands and breezier conditions.

'There's no signal for warm spells.'

Weather Channel forecaster Leon Brown said: 'The next week will be quite cold with temperatures down to -3C to -5C in rural areas, with a wetter and windier spell of weather at the end of March.'
