Gareth Bale is the star player in a new video teaser Real Madrid have released ahead of their new kit launch on Monday.

The Welshman is the sole Galactico to feature in the video, which gives a strong hint that they will wear a new pink third kit next season.

Bale blasts a trademark free kick towards goal and the framework shatters into pink pieces as the ball hits it.

A familiar scene: Bale prepares to blast a free kick towards goal in the video

The new 
video comes two days after Bale pulled out of the Wales squad to face 
the Netherlands next Wednesday with a leg muscle injury.

The
 24-year-old had been expected to captain his country for the first time
 in the absence of usual skipper Ashley Williams and Aaron Ramsey.

But
 after a long season in which he has struggled at times with a muscle 
contracture in his left thigh, Bale has opted to rest instead of play 
against Louis Van Gaal’s team at the Amsterdam Arena.
