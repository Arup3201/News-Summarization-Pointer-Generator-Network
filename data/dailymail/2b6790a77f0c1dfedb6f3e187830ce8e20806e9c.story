Campaign: Nigel Farage's Ukip has opened a new headquarters in London ahead of upcoming European elections

Ukip's new London headquarters is a chaotic environment where workers are sex-obsessed and volunteers frequently leave work early to go to the pub, it was claimed today.

Former employees say that the office in Mayfair is often full of workers' pets, while staff regularly take their clothes off and compile lists of people they would like to have sex with.

Nigel Farage's wife, who works as a secretary for Ukip, has reportedly described the office - which the party moved in to last year as part of its push to become a major political force - as a 'freakshow'.

The revelations about the bizarre atmosphere inside the headquarters were revealed after The Times spoke to a number of people who have worked in the building, which is located behind Claridge's hotel.

The office, which was lent to Ukip by wealthy backer Andrew Reid, is the centre of the party's push to beat the mainstream parties in this year's European elections, and to win its first MPs in the general election of 2015.

However, the insider accounts suggest that the new headquarters have failed to bring about a more professional approach, with one worker describing the atmosphere as 'Carry On politics' where staff are accustomed to ending work early and going to the pub instead.

One employee said: 'They are utterly chaotic. I was horrified by them. There's an element of the 70s golf club.'

Another added: 'You see the most extraordinary things. Everybody has been out with everybody else. There are animals in the office, people taking their clothes off... there are no sanctions. People are used to doing their own thing.'

At one point, workers wrote a list of 'people we want to s**g' on the office whiteboard - including the name of Mr Farage, the party leader who is Ukip's only household name.

His wife Kirsten reportedly has to send emails on Mr Farage's behalf, because he does not know how to use a computer and prefers to receive faxes.

She has admitted that the office 'takes some getting used to' and privately described the atmosphere as a 'freakshow', according to The Times.

A number of figures from the world of business have tried and failed to inject a more professional attitude into the party over the past few years.

Chief executive Will Gilpin resigned 
last year after just eight months in charge, saying he could not change 
Ukip's 'individualistic DNA'.

And
 millionaire backer Paul Sykes, who is funding the party's election 
campaign this year, has set up a parallel operation to avoid giving any 
money directly to headquarters.

The insider reports come in the wake of a number of embarrassing incidents involving Ukip candidates, most famously when MEP Godfrey Bloom referred to foreign aid recipients as 'bongo bongo land' and described women who fail to clean their homes properly as 'sluts'.

It was claimed today
 that the party's MEPs were being encouraged to pay a 'tithe' of £10,000
 a year to the party thanks to their 'generous expenses'.

Parliamentarians were
 allegedly told they had a duty to support Ukip financially, because the 
party spends around £125,000 for each successful election.

It
 was also reported that Ukip MEPs gather for a lavish dinner in 
Strasbourg once a month, with staff at the restaurant Pierre Bois et Feu
 instructed to produce a special English-themed menu.

Ukip director of communications Patrick O'Flynn said: 'I have been in post since the start of February and I have been hugely impressed with the professionalism and dedication of staff at Brooks Mews.

'The Times clearly would prefer Ukip to do very badly at the forthcoming local and European elections. But everyone at Brooks Mews is working flat out to ensure that the opposite occurs. Given the positive response Ukip is getting from the British public, we are very hopeful of achieving an excellent result.'
