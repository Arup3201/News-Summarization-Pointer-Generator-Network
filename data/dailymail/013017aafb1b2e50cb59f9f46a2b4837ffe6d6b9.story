Charged: Ehab Aly Mohamed, a former cosmetic surgeon has been charged with voluntary manslaughter

A former cosmetic surgeon has been charged with voluntary manslaughter after allegedly giving a deadly cocktail of drugs during a liposuction procedure.

Sharon Carpenter, 61, died following a 10-hour liposuction procedure Ehab Aly Mohamed carried out.

She died in the 46-year-old's Encino office in August 2010 after allegedly being given  a combination of liocaine, fentanyl and oxycodone.

LAPD Detective Joel Price told NBC that the surgeon who had Encino and Beverly Hills offices, had not shown any signs of remorse for his patient's death

The prosecution alleges that Mohamed’s office did not meet state-mandated safety standards involving equipment, staffing and emergency resources, reported the LA Times.

In an accusation filed on behalf of the Medical Board of California in May 2012, attorneys alleged that Mohamed’s medical assistant thought the woman was becoming dehydrated so contacted a local hospital to request intravenous fluids and intravenous tubing.

But Mohamed continued with the procedure after the hospital refused to 'sell'  him the medical supplies, reported the newspaper.

NBC Los Angeles also reported that Mohamed had also been 'performing medical procedures on himself'.

According to the District Attorney's statement, on May 21, 2010, a 77-year-old patient of Mohamed's passed out during a liposuction procedure and still suffers from related health problems.

Mohamed was also charged with elder abuse involving a second patient.

Mohamed faces up to 10 years in prison if he's convicted - he is already jailed on previous burglary and forgery convictions, 
according to a Los Angeles County District Attorney's office statement.

According to KNX ,he is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in Van Nuys Superior Court.
