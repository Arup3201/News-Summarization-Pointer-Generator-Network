The NYPD believe just four men may have been behind the attack on a Kenyan mall that killed more than 60 civilians in September and they all probably escaped alive.

The report, released on Tuesday, contradicts many of the claims made by Kenyan authorities, who had previously said that as many as 15 attackers were involved, including possible foreign nationals, and that they held hostages.

More than 60 civilians and six soldiers died in the Sept. 21 assault by terrorists from Somalia's Al-Qaeda-linked Shebab terror group on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi. The victims aged eight to 78, from 13 different countries.

On Tuesday morning, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that while investigators didn’t know ‘with certainty’ how many people were involved, ‘we believe there were only four shooters.’

The New York police report said the last confirmed sighting of the attackers on the mall's CCTV system was on September 22 at 00:54 hours, 12 hours after the start of the attack.

It took the Kenyan military almost four days to declare the mall safe. The day before doing so, Kenyan forces started a fire and collapsed a large part of the mall, the report said.

‘It is unknown if the terrorists were killed or escaped the mall. A major contributing factor to this uncertainty was the failure to maintain a secure perimeter around the mall,’ it said.

On Tuesday morning, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that he believes there were only four shooters who attacked the mall

According to the NYPD, the attackers carried only light weapons, there was no evidence that they had taken hostages and it was apparent that the Kenyan military had actually looted the high-end shopping complex.

The report also discredited the theory that the female British jihadi known as the White Widow was at the mall.

The NYPD sent several detectives to Nairobi with the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force to investigate the assault.

Their findings were assembled into the report by Lt. Detective Commander Kevin Yorke.

He questioned the Kenyan authorities’ theory that four of the attackers died when explosions collapsed parts of the mall.

‘As a cop, I’m very skeptical of claims until I see proof,’ said Yorke, and added that there is ‘a lot of doubt in my mind it is true.’

Most of the victims were probably killed in the first hour of the attack when the gunmen engaged in ‘wholesale killing’ of those trying to hide in places like storerooms, the report said.

According to witnesses and CCTV footage, the gunmen did not want to take hostages, only kill a broad spectrum of people.

The New York report also highlighted poor coordination between the Kenyan police and the army, which saw troops kill one police officer and wound the commander of a police team.

The report also describes a ‘conscious but erratic attempt’ at avoiding Muslim casualties.

At least one attacker asked some of the victims if they were Muslim, if they answered yes they were asked the name of the Prophet Mohammed's mother. If they didn't know, they were shot.

The four attackers are understood to have trained in Somalia.

Interpol is assisting Kenya in trying to identify four bodies suspected of being those of the gunmen. No identification has yet been announced.
