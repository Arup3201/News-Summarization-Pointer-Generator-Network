A comic known for dressing as an old woman on a popular Spanish TV show has been charged with possessing child pornography.

Adonis Losada, 49, used to appear on the popular Spanish-language TV variety show 'Sábado Gigante' on Univision.

The comic faces 66 child pornography charges, many involving graphic images of young children in sexual situations.

Justice: Adonis Losada, the 49-year-old former comic actor from the popular Spanish-language TV show Sábado Gigante, is now on trial in Palm Beach County on 66 counts of child pornography from September 2009

He has offered no defense and has refused to use an attorney in court.

Losada told Circuit Judge Karen Miller on Thursday, 'It's not my wish to be here.'

'I don't want to participate,' he said, 'send me the verdict and all that information.'

The judge has ruled Losada is mentally competent and has told him he is required to sit in the courtroom whilst the jury hears the evidence the Sun Sentinel reports.

'It's better if you are present,' Miller said, adding she had a hard time finding any past Florida cases where criminal defendants opted to stay in jail while their trials were held. 'It's your day in court.'

Funny man: Adonis Losada once made people laugh whenever he wore a gray wig and granny glasses for his acting role on the popular Spanish-language TV variety show Sa¡bado Gigante on Univision

If convicted on all charges he faces a minimum sentence of 44 years in state prison and a maximum of 330 years.

Before the trial got underway on Tuesday, Losada turned down a plea deal for a lighter sentence of 20 years.

Judge Miller asked Losada to think hard about taking part in his defense, noting that if he doesn't he can't complain about his conviction after the fact.

'The chairs are more comfortable up here than I imagine they are in a holding cell,' Miller said. 'We take breaks.'

Losada replied through his interpreter: 'I'd like the record to be clear: I am here against my wishes.'

Losada was first arrested in September 2009 after connecting online with a Boynton Beach police detective posing as a bilingual, bisexual adult male in a chat room for people interested in having sex with children.

The room was called '#baby@todderlove,' according to court records.

Losada used a social network to send Detective Charles Ramos — using the name 'Paul' — a photo of a boy and an adult male on August 28, 2009. He also invited Ramos to watch him pleasuring himself via his webcam.

The dialogue continued when Losada sent Ramos 32 more child porn images.

Four days later, Miami Beach police seized Losada's computer and reportedly discovered 16 child porn images.

Losada then told a Miami-Beach detective that he has 'a problem.'

In Palm Beach County, Losada was charged with 33 counts of transmitting child pornography, and 33 counts of child pornography. His bail was set at $3 million.

In Miami-Dade County, Losada was charged with 16 counts of possession of sexual performance of a child. Over the years he's been transferred back and forth between jails in the counties.

Losada's gig as a TV personality on Sábado Gigante ended with his arrest.

The trial is set to continue Friday with Detective Ramos still on the witness stand. Prosecutors plan to rest their case on Monday.
