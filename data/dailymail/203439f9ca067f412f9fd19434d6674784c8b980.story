Forty thousand campaigners were marching in London today to demand urgent action on climate change.

Celebrities including actress Emma Thompson and musician Peter Gabriel are joining campaigners and British flood victims at the march and rally.

It is one of 2,000 events taking place in 150 countries around the world ahead of a United Nations climate summit next week.

Some 100,000 people are expected to get involved in New York City - the summit's location - to demand leaders take action to tackle rising temperatures.

The UN summit has been convened by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in a bid to drive action and momentum towards talks in Paris in 2015.

‘With so many people of faith who believe it is their moral duty to speak out against climate change and the destruction of the planet, faith groups need to be involved in the climate talks.

'The developed world, which is chiefly responsible for the crisis we face, must take the lead by cutting its emissions furthest and fastest'

Andrew Pendleton, Friends of the Earth

‘However it is also on us to show that we first and foremost care.’

Ahead of the summit, Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns Andrew Pendleton said: ‘Time is running out to avoid catastrophic climate change.

‘International talks are not enough, we need urgent action too.

‘The developed world, which is chiefly responsible for the crisis we face, must take the lead by cutting its emissions furthest and fastest.

And he warned: ‘The UK's environmental credibility has been sinking for years.

‘The Government has been bending over backwards to develop fracking and extract more dirty gas and oil, instead of investing in the UK's huge renewable power potential and a cleaner future for us all.’
