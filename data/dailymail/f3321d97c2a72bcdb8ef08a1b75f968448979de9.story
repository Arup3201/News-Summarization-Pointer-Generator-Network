Shonda Rhimes, the creator of 'Scandal' and 'Grey's Anatomy', has slammed an email exchange leaked in the Sony hack - and called out the media for not taking a stronger stance against it.

In the exchange, Sony Pictures Co-Chairman Amy Pascal and Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin jokingly guess what President Obama's might be - suggesting films that feature black characters, like Django Unchained and 12 Years a Slave. They conclude: 'I bet he likes Kevin Hart.'

After the emails emerged, they were reported to be 'racially insensitive' by multiple media outlets.

On Thursday, Rhimes, 44, slammed this characterization.

Speaking out: Shonda Rhimes, pictured, slammed a leaked email exchange between Sony's Co-Chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin, who suggested Obama's favorite movies starred black characters

'Calling Sony comments "racially insensitive remarks" instead of 'racist'?' she tweeted. 'U can put a cherry on a pile of s*** but it don't make it a sundae.'

So far the hacked information has been humiliating for Sony Pictures Entertainment. 

A group called Guardians of Peace has taken responsibility and demanded that Sony stops its release of 'The Interview'. The movie, starring James Franco and Seth Rogan, lampoons North Korea.

The premiere of the movie went ahead undisturbed in Los Angeles on Thursday night, but security was tight and there were no interviews held on the red carpet.

In the leaked exchange that Rhimes called out, the two movie heavyweights discussed President Obama as Pascal sought his advice on what to speak to him about at a fundraiser.

'Would he like to finance some movies,' Rudin responded.

Anger: On Thursday, she took to Twitter and slammed the media, who have referred to the remarks as 'racially insensitive', for failing to take a stronger stance against the email exchange

'I doubt it. Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' Pascal asked.

'12 YEARS,' Rudin responded. 

'Or the butler. Or think like a man?' Pascal went on.

'Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' Rudin said. 

In another leaked email, Pascal also calls Angelina Jolie a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'.

She has since issued an apology saying: 'The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am.'

Rudin has also apologized for the comments.

Furor: Scott Rudin, left, and Amy Pascal, right, suggested that President Obama might like '12 Years A Slave' of 'Django Unchained' in the email exchange. They concluded: 'I bet he likes Kevin Hart'

'I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive - and not funny at all,' he said. 'To anybody I've offended, I'm profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused.' 

Rhimes was awarded the Sherry Lansing Leadership Award on Wednesday at the Hollywood Reporter's annual Women In Entertainment breakfast.

In an awkward moment at the event, Angelina Jolie was seen glaring at Pascal, who called her a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' in one of the leaked emails, as the Sony exec tried to embrace her.
