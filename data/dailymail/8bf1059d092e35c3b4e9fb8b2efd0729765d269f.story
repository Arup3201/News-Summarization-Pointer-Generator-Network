Despite holding a seven-point cushion over second-placed Manchester City, Mourinho believes the title race is far from over yet. 

He added: 'With 14 matches to go. We are speaking about 42 points, that’s a lot of points. But we know that we have 7 points more than the second, ten to the third and 14 to the fourth.

'And in this moment every match we win, every point we get, we get a little bit closer, but it’s still too far.'

Jose Mourinho was speaking exclusively to BT Sport ahead of Chelsea’s game against Everton.
