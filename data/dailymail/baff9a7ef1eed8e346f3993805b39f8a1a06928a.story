As the flame of a large, household candle approaches my hair, I fight back the very natural instinct to panic and yank my head away.

Everyone knows what happens when naked flames and hair meet: it rarely ends well. I still wince when I recall seeing my daughter’s hair catch light during a candlelit carol service years ago. 

Her long hair swung forward into the candle she was holding and went up like a torch. Thankfully, only an inch or two burned before the flame fizzled out, but it gave us all a shock.

The technique orginates from Brazil and promises to rid your whole head of split ends, not just the bottom of you hair (picture posed by model) 

With that vision in mind, I try not to flinch as Nando Lopes, education director at Richard Ward Hair and Metrospa in Chelsea, London, inches into view. He is the man with the candle — and he is about to set fire to a twisted flank of my hair.

It may sound insane, but what he is doing is an age-old Brazilian hair-smoothing technique called velaterapia, which gets rid of split ends — and Candle Clinic is the latest treatment on offer at this swish super-salon.

Richard Ward is famous for tending the tresses of the Middleton sisters, so I feel I am in safe hands. He wouldn’t offer a treatment that would turn a royal into a real-life Miss Havisham, would he?

‘It sounds crazy,’ says Nando, ‘but it works, 100 per cent. It’s the best way to get rid of split ends. If we try to cut split ends out, it is impossible — it takes for ever. But by burning them, you catch all of them.’

Split ends, where the ends of the hair shaft split in two, are inconvenient for anyone trying to grow their hair. As hair gets older, it becomes more likely to split, as the protective cuticle around each strand becomes worn.

Split ends aren’t a problem, as such, but they make hair look frizzy and rough. Although conditioner can smooth these cuticles down so they are less obvious, nothing will actually mend a split end. Usually, the only answer is to cut them off.

Championed by Victoria’s Secret supermodels Alessandra Ambrosio and Isabeli Fontana, velaterapia — better known as ‘candle cutting’ — instead uses a flame to singe away split ends and effectively cauterize the hair, creating a sturdy seal that makes it less prone to split again. How it works is simple. Nando, who learned the technique from a Brazilian stylist, takes a section of my hair and twizzles it into a tight twist about as thick as a pencil.

He pulls it taut and away from my head, and I can see the tiny ends of shorter hairs sticking out. Then, he takes the candle and lets the flame lick up and down the twist of hair.

The tiny, sticking-out ends flare up, making me wince in alarm. But just as I’m about to panic that my crowning glory is going up in smoke, the burning ends fizzle out.

The unpleasant smell of singed hair gets stronger as Nando works around my head, tiny section by tiny section. It looks as though the flame is licking over his fingers, too, though he says it doesn’t hurt.

‘The hair doesn’t catch fire as it is twisted so tightly,’ he says. ‘Only the bits that stick out get singed. It melts the ends together and seals them, so it’s a clever way of getting rid of split ends all the way down the hair. That’s why it’s great for keeping long hair smooth — if you have a trim, you only catch the split ends at the very bottom.’

I last had my hair cut three months ago, so there are likely a fair number of split ends. I think a lot of what is going up in flames is just hair that hasn’t grown the full length of the twist. It doesn’t stand a chance.

The technique is becoming hugely popular. Word is spreading fast, and it’s catching on (sorry) like wildfire. Nando already treats ten heads a week — at £195 a go — and he’s now training other hairdressers in the art of the candle.

For good measure, Nando waves the candle under the tuft at the end of each twist. I fear all these burnt bits will be left rough and bobbly — but when I feel them, there is no roughness. The whole thing has taken just half-an-hour.

Once my hair has been washed to get rid of the candle smuts, it is indulged with a ten-minute intense conditioning treatment, then blow-dried. It has rarely felt so smooth.

I’m delighted and impressed. But I must say, don’t try this at home!
