Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has told striker Mario Balotelli he will not get picked for the squad unless he improves in training.

The £16million summer signing did not make the squad for the goalless FA Cup fourth round draw at home to Bolton despite being fit after illness.

'Balotelli wasn't injured, he was just not selected,' said Rodgers. 'It's tough for him.

'We had an hour or so yesterday (Friday) chatting. He understands where we are at. He was out for a week not well.

'I am judging it every day in training - Mario is exactly the same as every other player, there is no special treatment for anyone,' said the Reds boss. 

'We had an hour or so yesterday chatting and he understands where he is at. He knows exactly what is required to be in this squad before he can be in the team.'

'But he knows the level of what this team is at. He has seen the pressing and aggression and if you can't do that, then you aren't going to be a part of that.' 

'Mario will work very hard to feature again. I'm confident he will respond in the right way.' 

Daniel Sturridge will return to full training at Melwood on Monday having not featured for Liverpool since August.

Sturridge has only recently returned to light training after a long spell out with a thigh injury

Sturridge and Balotelli last played together for Liverpool in a 3-0 victory over Spurs on August 31

The striker is scheduled to appear in next weekend's Premier League clash against West Ham United and could even make the squad for Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Chelsea.

'Daniel starts training tomorrow (Monday) with the team,' said Rodgers.

'He had his final rehabilitation with the sports science team today and now it's about getting the condition with football fitness and game fitness.

'We'll see how he is for Tuesday, if he's not ready for Tuesday then he will be back for sure against West Ham next weekend.'
