It's rare for men and women to agree on a holiday, but they do share the view that Prince Harry would be a top holiday companion.

The royal redhead is the person most women want to take away with them, ahead of serial poll-topper George Clooney and Stephen Fry, in a survey commissioned by British Airways Holidays.

Holly Willoughby is the top choice for men (and number eight with women), followed by actresses Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, and Jeremy Clarkson in fourth.

Holiday royalty: The public figure men and women agree would be great to take on holiday is Prince Harry

Top choice: 22 per cent of the adults surveyed said they wanted to go away with Prince Harry

Popular: The Duchess of Cambridge is popular with both sexes as well, but Prince William doesn't fare so well

Both sexes
 are also on the same page when it comes to wanting to take the Duchess 
of Cambridge away, but no such luck for her husband Prince William who 
doesn't crack the top 10 in either list.

Although where the couple go does have an impact on trends.

'We often see a rise in the number of bookings to a particular destination after a Royal visit or when it’s named as a celebrity hot-spot,' said Claire Bentley, British Airways Holidays’ managing director, citing Australia as the most significant example of a booming destination after the royal couple's recent tour Down Under.

On a list of 57 celebrities to chose from, the future king was 26th with men and 15th with women. 

When
 it comes to kids dream celebrity holiday pals, they lean towards 
celebrity royalty instead of the real ones. Boys aged 5-12 in the poll 
most want to vacation with Rihanna while girls in the same age bracket 
have Harry Styles at the top of their list.

Brooklyn
 Beckham, the oldest son of David and Victoria Beckham, is popular with 
both boys and girls finishing second in each list while Katy Perry is 
third from a selection of 27 kids' favourites.
