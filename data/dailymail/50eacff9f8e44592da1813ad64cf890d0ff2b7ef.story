He is revered by his people as seemingly all-powerful.

But it seems North Korea is not au fait with Kim Jong Un's break dancing, arm-wrestling and skipping - on show in a spoof video that has gone viral.

In a series of clearly photoshopped scenes compiled by a Chinese student, the dictator is shown cavorting in a field with Osama bin Laden, riding a pig through a snowy field, and being fly-kicked into a swimming pool by President Barack Obama.

And Pyongyang is not happy.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Outrage: North Korea has called on China to delete a spoof video showing Kim Jong Un doing ridiculous dances

Absurd: The three-minute video superimposes the dictators head onto a series of absurd dances

Cameo: President Obama features in a number of sketches, dancing with Kim and fly-kicking him numerous times

'It seriously compromises Kim’s dignity and authority,' a top-ranking official from the Hermit Kingdom said, according to Asia News.

North Korean are now calling on China to delete the video by a teenager named locally as Zhang - but Shanghai claims it is powerless to stop it.

The video starts with Kim Jong Un's face superimposed onto a maintenance worker.

While tidying fields, he drops his rake to burst into a dance - falling into the splits and backwards rolling.

'Insult': Pyongyang officials branded the video 'insulting' as Kim skips into the sunset with Osama bin Laden

Pirouettes: It seems North Korean officials are not au fait with their dictator's balletic skills

Attack: In a rare moment of victory for Kim in this video, he is seen beating up Japan's Shinzo Abe

The scene is followed by a montage of dance clips.

First, Kim Jong Un as a waiter who delights crowds with his moves - before dropping his trousers and giggling excitedly.

He then moonwalks down a street and pirouettes in a basketball court.

Back-up dancers in the form of his father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung then appear as all three perform some kind of synchronised street dance.

'Star-studded': Putin also makes an appearance in a dance off seemingly chaired by the UN's Ban Ki Moon

Embarrassing: Another scene shows the leader trying to set off a missile - which then spirals up and hits him

In the first of many face-offs with Obama, he is then shown dancing up to the American president - who kicks him to the ground.

But all is well as the North Korean dictator picks himself back up and skips into the sunset with Osama bin Laden.

Other scenes feature President Putin wildly shaking his hips, and a bloody battle between Kim and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
