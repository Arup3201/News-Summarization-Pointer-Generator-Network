A triathlete who was clinically dead for 11 minutes after his heart stopped during a race in the Hudson River has spoken out about his miraculous recovery.

Chris LaPak, a 53-year-old married father of two and fitness buff, has now returned to work as CEO of a graphics company on Long Island, New York - even though paramedics who pulled him from the water in August were not sure he would make it.

Speaking to ABC News six months on, he said it is a 'miracle' he is still alive.

'I'm on borrowed time,' he said. 'My heart stopped, and it remained stopped anywhere between 11 and 13 minutes.'

Getting ready: Chris LaPak, pictured before taking part in the New York triathlon last August, suffered a heart attack in the water and was clinically dead for 11 minutes. He woke up without brain damage days later

Event: He was swimming in the Hudson River, pictured, on August 3 when he suffered cardiac arrest and started drowning in the water. He was spotted by a lifeguard who took him to a boat

LaPak's parents both died of heart attacks in their 50s  - but by the time he was 52, he had already completed three marathons and had signed up for the triathlon in New York City last August.

'I work out so much,' he said. 'I think subconsciously I thought could beat this whole thing.'

Days before the triathlon, he had been at a hot yoga class when he felt chest pain and shortness of breath, but he ignored it. Doctors believe he actually suffered a heart attack, leaving him with an irregular heartbeat, ABC reported.

Then on August 3, he planned to swim 1.5 kilometers, cycle for 40 kilometers and run for 10 kilometers in the trialthon, but his heart stopped shortly after he got into the Hudson River at 7am.

The next thing he can remember, he was waking up in hospital five days later - but medical personnel have since revealed how their flawless response saved his life.

After his heart stopped, he had started to drown and was immediately spotted by lifeguards and fished out of the water onto a surfboard. They then took him to a jet ski and a fire department boat.

NYC Triathlon Lifeguard Director Cary Epstein told Fox News that LaPak had no pulse and was 'as purple as you could ever possibly imagine'.

'I honestly didn't think that he was going to make it in the condition that he was in,' he said.

LaPak was rushed to the dock, put in an ambulance and taken to Roosevelt Hospital before he was transferred to Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital.

By the time he reached the hospital, he had been clinically dead for 11 minutes, paramedics said.   

Dr. Eyal Herzog, the director of Mount Sinai St. Luke's Cardiac Care Unit, cooled down LaPak's body to 94.1 degrees F (33 C) to protect his brain before slowly warming up his body again. 

When he opened his eyes five days later, he was able to tell the time and name everyone in the room.

'Everyone was in shock,' LaPak said. 'My family and friends had been told there was a less than 10 per cent chance I was going to live. And if I did, there was a 95 per cent chance I'd be brain dead.'

Dr Herzog said that flawless work from every emergency responder made LaPak's survival possible.

Healthy: LaPak, pictured with his wife Renee, is now back at work and has learned to slow down, he said

'The people in the field were so good, they conducted it like a textbook chain of survival,' the doctor told the Daily Herald last year. 'From the soldier in the field to the expert captain in the hospital.'

LaPak underwent double bypass surgery and had a defibrillator implanted. He now runs 10 to 12 miles several times a week and has also learned CPR in case he ever sees anyone in need.

In November, he returned to Mount Sinai to meet with those who had saved him, and he became emotional at how thankful he was for their quick-thinking.

'They never quit on me,' he said. 'They gave me an opportunity to have more life and to see my two kids get married and have kids.'
