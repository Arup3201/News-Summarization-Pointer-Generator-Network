Tesco shoppers will soon be able to 
pick up a stylish cup-boosting bra along with their groceries as Ultimo's 
Michelle Mone unveils another exclusive range with the supermarket giant.

The glamorous multi-millionaire Ultimo founder has partnered with Tesco for the second time on the exclusive Bra Queen Lingerie range.

After a successful first offering in 2011, Michelle has stuck to Tesco's 'every little helps' motto by pricing her lingerie from just £6 - a fraction of the cost of an 
Ultimo bra which usually retails for around £30.

Bra Queen promises to enable customers to 'buy into Michelle Mone OBE's vast design expertise, offering luxe lingerie at affordable prices'.

Michelle has taken inspiration from the glamorous, boudoir style lingerie of the past, and given her designs a soft, feminine edge with plenty of pretty pinks and cool aquas.

All shapes and sizes: Millionaire Michelle has designed the range with women of all shapes and sizes in mind, the briefs go up to a size 18 and bras to a cup size G

Every little helps: The stylish bras start at £12, a fraction of the cost of Ultimo's usual offerings, which start at £35

And while many shoppers have preconceptions about the quality of Tesco's purse-friendly garments, Michelle has set about putting a heavy emphasis on quality by using plenty of satins, laces and embroideries to exude an element of luxury.

The range, which starts at £6 for briefs and £12 for bras, is 35 items strong and offers both non-padded as well as padded bra styles.

Michelle has designed the range with 
all women in mind and promises that the new collection has been cut to 
flatter an array of body shapes, offering bras in cup size B to G and a 
choice of co-ordinating briefs and thongs in sizes 8-18.

Michelle Mone OBE said: 'I'm so excited about Bra Queen and it's going from strength to strength.

Quality: Michelle didn't want to compromise on quality even though the bras are much cheaper than her usual designs

Boudoir: Michelle took inspiration from luxuries of the past and the lingerie has quite a vintage feel to it with champagne and black tones

'This new collection took over a year to develop as we had a target from Tesco on design and price.

'Price points were previously £16 or more and now all bras are £12 when they should be £35.

'We achieve this because of volumes of fabric etc. I'm delighted my customers will be getting incredible value, every little helps.'

The new Bra Queen collection is available exclusively at selected Tesco stores and online.

Proud: Entrepreneur Michelle is extremely proud of the range and hopes to see it sell as well as her previous collection for the store
