The spectre of yet another scam, exhumed by the CBI, is back to haunt the beleaguered Congress - both in Andhra Pradesh as well as at the centre.

The party was dealt a fresh blow on Saturday when the CBI named the late chief minister of the state, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy in a chargesheet filed before a special court in connection with the disproportionate assets case  of his son, Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy.

The investigating agency charged YSR with entering into a 'criminal conspiracy' to allot land to two pharmaceutical companies in exchange for investing in the business empire of Jagan as a quid pro quo arrangement.

This is for the first time that the CBI has included the former chief minister's name in the chargesheet. It named Jagan as accused number 1, followed by 12 other individuals and firms.

However, the agency told the court that it had not considered YSR's name for prosecution as he was not alive.

The direct mention of YSR has left the already besieged Congress in the state crimson- faced, because the current government is seen as a continuation of the dispensation helmed by the late party leader. Most of the ministers, who were privy to the decisions allegedly taken by YSR while making questionable land allotments, also secured berths in the Kiran Kumar Reddy government.

Unsurprisingly, the YSR Congress party headed by Jagan has demanded that the CBI also prosecute these ministers, if it found fault with the YSR government's decisions.

The development comes at a time when the Congress government in the state is afflicted by multiple crises. The agitation for the separate state of Telangana has brought governance to a virtual standstill in Andhra Pradesh, with MLAs as well as MPs of the Congress themselves hopping over to the side of the protesters.

Under pressure: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy

Doubts have been raised about CM Kiran Kumar Reddy's leadership ever since he took charge and allegations of corruption have also been levelled often at the current Congress government.

Furthermore, several party leaders are shifting loyalties to the YSR Congress. The Congress-led Union government is also neck-deep in trouble, with a spate of scams related to the Commonwealth Games, 2-G spectrum allocation, coal block allocation and army truck deals surfacing one after the other.

Now, as the CBI has indicted YSR in the illegal assets case of Jagan, one of the Congress's two citadels in the South (the other being Kerala) looks all set to crumble. The party's leaders in the state are trying to wash their hands off the matter by peddling the argument that they could not be held responsible for the acts of omission and commission made by YSR during his regime.

'The state's cabinet does have collective responsibility, but the ministers are not responsible for surreptitiously struck deals,' PCC president Botsa Satyanarayana, who was a key member of the YSR cabinet, claimed.

State BJP president G. Kishan Reddy, however, rejected the defence put up by Satyanarayana: 'Till his death, YSR was a Congressman. So, the party has to pay the penalty for whatever decisions he had taken,' he said.

Prime accused Jagan's likely arrest in the case is also giving the Congress sleepless nights. Sources in the party revealed that the CBI may not arrest YSR's son till the completion of bypolls to 18 assembly seats in the state in June. This was because the ruling party was apprehensive that Jagan's incarceration at this stage would trigger a serious law and order problem in the state, and there was every possibility of the sympathy factor working in his favour during the byelections.

Significantly, if Jagan's party wins all the 18 seats, Congress leaders could shift en masse to his camp. In paragraph 69 of the chargesheet, the CBI said investigations had revealed that in 2006, K. Nityananda Reddy, MD of Aurobindo Pharma Limited, and Hetero Group of Companies director M. Srinivas Reddy had hatched a criminal conspiracy with YSR as well as senior IAS official B.P. Acharya. The latter, who was then the MD of the AP Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, and YSR allegedly colluded to allot 75 acres of land at the Pharma Special Economic Zone at Jadcherla in Mahabubnagar district to the two industry head honchos without in violation of rules.

The CBI disclosed that land was allotted at `7 lakh per acre, which was well below the fixed rate, thereby giving a benefit of `17.20 crore to the two pharma companies. As a quid pro quo, Aurobindo - through the relatives of Nityananda Reddy - invested `3 crore in Jagati Publications. Hetero and its director had pumped in `4.5 crore into Jagati and `15 crore into Janani Infrastructure, promoted by Jaganmohan Reddy.

The CBI pointed out that APIIC chief general manager (projects) T.L. Ramachandran had rejected the file sent by Acharya recommending the allotment of land, stating that the deal could not be struck at just `7 lakh per acre. Yet Acharya had ordered that the corporation give the 'inprinciple letter of allocation' to the two companies at the same rate citing an approval from YSR.

Acharya got the clearance papers signed by YSR who had, in turn, personally handed them over to the pharma company representatives, the CBI alleged. Intriguingly, the entire exercise was completed in a day.

The CBI also found fault with the YSR government for letting Aurobindo transfer 30.33 acres out of the land allotted to it at Pasamylaram industrial estate at Patancheru in Medak district to another company, Trident Life Sciences Limited.

'Jaganmohan, in league with his father YSR, Acharya and APIIC official YVL Prasad entered into the nefarious deal of allotting land to Aurobindo and Hetero at Jadcherla SEZ by violating norms. Other group companies joined the conspiracy and are, therefore, liable for prosecution,' the CBI chargesheet said.

The CBI authorities said these were just a few companies that had benefited from dealing with YSR. In an apparent damage-control exercise, state cabinet minister S. Sailaja Nath said the Kiran Kumar Reddy government would take back the land allotted to certain companies by YSR.

The CBI has been investigating the case following a high court order in August 2011, based on a petition filed by former state minister P. Shankar Rao, who had alleged Jagan had amassed wealth to the tune of `43,000 crore during the regime of his father Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy between 2004 and 2009.

The business empire of Jagan began with taking over of SPCL in 2001 from its original promoter M.B.Ghorpade with an initial paid up capital of `53.51 crore. In 2005, Jagan brought in `124.60 crore investments into SPCL from two Mauritiusbased companies - 2i Capital and Pluri Emerging Company.

The CBI report says Jagan's auditor V. Vijay Sai Reddy had manipulated the valuation reports of Carmel Asia and Jagathi Publications to jack up their values to enable them sell the shares to several high profile investors and companies at a premium of `350 per share.

Jagan had allegedly created fictitious transactions of selling 82 lakh shares of SPCL at `18.75 each to five companies - Sai Surya Warehousing Company limited, Excel Prosoft Limited, Sigma.

Jagan had allegedly diverted the funds from the SPCL to float four subsidiary companies - Carmel Asia Holdings Pvt Ltd, Silicon Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, Krishna Power Technologies Ltd and Bhagavat Sannidhi Estates Pvt Ltd.

Several companies such as Indu Projects, Ramky Infra, Pioneer Infra, Aurobindo Pharma, Lanco and individuals such as Nimmagadda Prasad had invested in Jagan's media house.
