Health tourists taking advantage of free treatment on the NHS have cost the taxpayer £40million, it has been revealed.

Due to the lax system of checks carried out by GPs and British hospitals, many foreigners are able to undergo often lengthy and expensive treatment then simply leave the country without paying.

Conservative MP Chris Skidmore carried out a study of 118 health trusts which has revealed that up to 3,600 foreigners run up debts to the NHS of £1,000 or more each year.

Burden: Health tourists receiving treatment on the NHS and leaving without paying have cost British taxpayers £40million

Mr Skidmore is now calling on the government to introduce new laws to clamp down on patients from overseas who cheat the system.

He said: 'NHS services are paid for by British taxpayers, who work hard and are proud of the health service that successive generations have built.

'Opening this up internationally, free of charge, is not fair on those who actually pay for it.'

Mr Skidmore wants all non-emergency hospital patients to provide passports or proof of residence before they receive treatment.

And he believes GPs need to carry out far more effective checks before they refer patients for treatment.

Under his proposals, non-UK residents would also be charged a flat fee for seeing a GP.

He added: 'GPs are often the first point of contact with the NHS for individuals, and as such provide a gate keeping function.

'At present anyone can register with a GP, and it is not obligatory for the practice to check whether or not an individual is entitled to free hospital care.

'It is therefore entirely possible for a patient eligible for charges to be referred to a hospital for treatment, and not pay a penny, due to the necessary information not being transmitted.'

Mr Skidmore used Freedom of Information requests, to ask every NHS Trust in the country how much they were owed by foreign nationals and how much of that had been written off.

Of the 118 trusts responded Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust were owed the most with more than £8million renmaining unpaid.

The next two were Barts and London NHS Trust, who were owed around £3 million and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust who were owed roughly £2.7million.  

Earlier this week BBC's Panorama programme revealed some health tourists are paying bribes of up to £1,000 to get onto GP surgery lists so they can claim free treatment.

Reform: Conservative MP Chris Skidmore believes GPs need to carry out effective checks before they refer patients for treatment

Their investigation uncovered a thriving black market in which NHS staff are illegally accepting cash.

Once registered with a practice, patients are being seen by GPs and then referred for hospital treatment worth tens of thousands of pounds.

The investigation found one manager at a
 surgery in the West Midlands was offering to register an entire family 
from India for £5,000.

He also took £800 from a female undercover reporter posing as a health tourist to put her on the practice’s list.

The reporter claimed to be an Indian patient suffering from the back condition sciatica, which wouldn’t merit free treatment as it isn’t deemed urgent.

But she was subsequently referred to hospital for an MRI scan that would have cost the NHS £800 – the same as the cost of her place on the list.

The unidentified manager told her it was ‘good business’ as she had already got her money back with the cost of the scan – and would be likely to benefit from more expensive treatment. The manager said: ‘Just with the scan you’ve made your money.’

The investigation also discovered that ‘fixers’ – who aren’t employed by the NHS – are putting overseas patients on GP lists in exchange for cash.

These individuals are likely to have close ties with managers or doctors within the surgery who agree to register the patients.

Mr Skidmore said: ‘This is nothing short of abuse of precious NHS resources. It’s highly irresponsible of somebody to be making money out of patients who are vulnerable.

‘The law is clear: if you’re not eligible for free treatment then you should be paying for it.’

Only patients who have lived in the UK for the past year can get free hospital treatment.

But NHS staff will treat anyone whose condition is deemed life-threatening or urgent, including women giving birth.

Treatment at hospital A&E units and walk in clinics is also free for all. GPs have discretion about whether or not to charge patients who are not on their lists depending on how urgent they assess the patient’s condition to be.

But GP surgeries are not legally obliged to register overseas patients. In fact many don’t, as they worry that if the patients are later referred to hospital, they won’t pay for the treatment.

Although hospital staff are meant to check patients have been living in the UK for at least a year before treating them – unless they are urgent – many don’t bother.

So once patients are on GP lists, they can potentially be given thousands of pounds of hospital treatment without ever having to pay.

For EU residents, their home country will cover the cost of treatment in the UK through the European health insurance card scheme.

In addition, the Health Service will not charge for treating certain infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV to prevent them spreading.

Health Minister Anna Soubry said: 'The NHS is not there to serve the health needs of the world and we will not tolerate abuse of the system, but it does have a duty to help anyone whose life or long-term health is at immediate risk without demanding a credit card up front.

'Last year we began a wholesale review of the current system to address concerns about access, cut down abuse and consider how best to ensure those who should pay do so.'
