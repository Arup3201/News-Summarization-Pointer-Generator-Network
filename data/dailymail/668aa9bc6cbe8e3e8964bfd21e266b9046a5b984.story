They have become frequent collaborators on the stage and screen.

But it seems the relationship between James Franco and his actor and writer friend Scott Haze goes beyond a working affinity.

The New York Times reported the friends, who describe themselves as 'brothers', are living together in Brooklyn for the summer. 'They are now so close that describing them merely as friends would be a disservice,' the newspaper said.

 buddies: James Franco and Scott Haze pictured together at the Venice 
Film Festival Premiere of Child Of God back in September last year

'We live in the same place,' Franco 
told the newspaper during a recent interview where he and Haze were 
mistakenly ordered two town cars instead of one as they left the Joe 
Allen restaurant in New York City.

But
 the renewed interest in his personal life prompted Franco to brand one 
media outlet's reporting of the New York Times piece as 'homophobic' on Wednesday.

He captioned a snapshot of the pair, 'James Franco Is Living With A Man,' adding underneath: 'Go
 see CHILD OF GOD in theaters and see me direct my live-in boyfriend, 
SCOTT HAZE!!! Love you SCOTT!!!!'

Haze gives an acclaimed performance in Franco's film 
adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel which opened on Friday,
 and the Oscar-nominated actor has also cast his pal in his forthcoming movie
 version of The Sound And The Fury.

The
 36-year-old star and Haze are close friends, having met in acting class more than ten years ago.

'When I came out to Hollywood, I was a crazy young kid who didn’t have a lot of direction,' Haze told The Daily Beast in a recent interview.

'James was a very disciplined guy at the time and he was an acquaintance of mine,' he added. 'We’ve become like brothers over the past six years, but we’ve known each other for ten.

'I
 went through a very crazy time, whether it was at the Chateau, running 
wild in Malibu, I just went through it. He was able to sneak into my 
life and give me guidance, basically, when I was going through a hard 
time. He was there for me.'

The pair have enjoyed a fruitful working relationship, with Haze also currently appearing in the Off-Broadway production The Long Shrift directed by none other than Franco.

'I’ll put Scott in anything,' the 127 Hours star recently said of his willingness to cast Haze, who also helped him out by allowing Franco to film his movie Interior. Leather Bar at the theatre he owns in Los Angeles.

The docufiction film reimagines and attempts to recreate the 40 minutes of deleted footage of gay sex from the controversial 1980 film Cruising.

'I do want to shock the audience,' Franco admitted to The Times. 'I do want to shake them out of their normal viewing experience.'

Haze has also posted a multitude of Instagram posts showing the pair posing, arms around each other and smiling for the camera on a variety of red carpet events.

Away from work, the pair also enjoy spending some rather daring downtime together.

'James and I are both really workaholics, so normally we do projects that are fun that involve work,' Haze said in The Daily Beast interview.

'So we’ll throw events at my theater, we’ll go do a play together, we’ll go play paintball naked with real paint.'

Franco dated actress and musician Marla Sokoloff for five years before romancing actress girlfriend Ahna O'Reilly - confirming the split in 2011.

He was then been linked with his Spring Breakers co-star Ashley Benson and more recently, LA-based model Erin Johnson.
