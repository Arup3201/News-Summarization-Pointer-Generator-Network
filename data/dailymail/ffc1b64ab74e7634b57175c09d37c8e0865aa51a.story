Unlike traditional speed cameras, the new gantry devices, pictured, are painted grey, making them harder to spot

Motorists risk heavy fines following the introduction of a new generation of speed cameras on Britain’s busiest motorway.

Digital technology has been introduced to catch drivers breaking the 70mph speed limit on the M25 in Kent.

It was reported last night that the devices – dubbed ‘stealth cameras’ by critics – have caught almost 700 drivers in just two months.

Unlike traditional yellow speed cameras, the gantry devices are painted grey, making them harder to spot for drivers.

The same technology is being introduced on a northern section of the M25 and also parts of the M1, M3, M60 and M6.

Front and rear-facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle’s speed. 

And, while conventional devices have to be trained on only one lane at a time, the digital cameras can scan four.

They are similar to cameras used during roadworks but do not work on the basis of calculating an average speed over a fixed distance.

Motoring groups claim the devices will see thousands of drivers facing at least £100 in fines and points on their licence for straying marginally over the 70mph limit.

The Association of Chief Police Officers recommends drivers are not charged unless they exceed 79mph in a 70mph limit zone.

Hugh Bladon, one of the founder members of the Alliance of British Drivers, said they did not believe targeting drivers on the motorways was the best way to improve safety and that punishing drivers for exceeding the 70mph limit was often unnecessary.

'The 70mph limit is not a speed that a lot of people bother to observe any more,' he said. 

'It was originally brought in as an experiment and was made permanent without any real testing. It was brought in at a time when the stopping power of cars was a bit like stopping an oil tanker, and the maximum speed of most cars was 74mph. We've moved on now, some 50 years later we have cars that stop much more quickly. 

'The amount of traffic that exceeds the 70mph limit is enormous. Most people are driving at 80mph on motorways, and these are our safest roads in the country.' 

Mr Bladon said he did not think using speed cameras on the M25 was appropriate because there are many times, particularly late at night or when there is little traffic, when it is safe to driver faster than 70mph. He also said these should be made more visible, rather than disguised to try and catch drivers out. 

In the two months since they have been installed on the M25, pictured, almost 700 drivers have been caught breaking the 70mph limit 

Where the new cameras will be placed: Several stretches of road are being upgraded to become 'smart motorways', with new speed cameras a part of improvements. Above, a map detailing which will be affected

He added: 'We seem to want to punish drivers rather than help them. Our whole philosophy about speed cameras in this country is wrong. 

'In France, for example, if they need to slow traffic down for a particular junction or nasty bend they bit up a great big sign, miles before the camera. We just whack cameras up for no reason whatsoever.

'The idea of a camera should be that you want people to see it and slow down.' 

Mr Bladon said he believed cameras only looked at a small fraction of the problem and could not test how tired people were or if they had taken drugs or been drinking. He said the best way to make roads safer was to  increase the number of police on the roads. 

In 2013 the number of people fined for speeding peaked at more than 115,000 - the highest level since 2009. Ministers said the rise was largely due to the increased number of speed cameras that were  in operation for 24 hours a day. In total 115,549 motorists were fined more than £100 that year. 

It was also announced last year that the maximum fines for motorway speeding that could be imposed by magistrates would rise from £2,500 to £10,000. 

In 2012-13 the Government collected £284million in speeding fines.

Rupert Lipton, managing director of the National Motorists Action Group, said he was 'shocked' officials had decided to use this type of speeding enforcement. 

He said: 'This is a another missed opportunity. The Highways Agency is introducing so called ‘smart motorways’ but relying on dumb enforcement. It is policing by numbers, by remote control. 

'The completely ignored key to road safety is driver training. If drivers who had competed some advanced training ‘earned’ the right to drive at a higher speed on motorways, many millions would take such training, learn proper observation, anticipation and planning in their driving and accident figures would plummet. Drivers would even be prepared to pay out of their own pockets and the benefits would affect all roads not just motorways.'

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, told The Times: ‘The law is the law but it needs to be applied consistently. Many constabularies have followed the ACPO guidance.

‘If the new approach is one of zero tolerance then it needs to be equally applied across the network and understood by motorists and police forces.’

The Highways Agency said signs warning about speed cameras should be displayed on every gantry of the motorway where they are used.  

Studies have shown that nine out of ten drivers admit to breaking the motorway speed limit.

The Government had planned to raise the limit to 80mph before the proposals were shelved by transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin two years ago.

Brake, the road safety group, has previously said that raising the speed limit would cause more accidents and deaths on motorways. 

The first cameras were installed between junctions five and six of the M25. Kent police figures showed that 668 speeding offences were logged in just over two months.

Until now, cameras have mainly been used to keep drivers below 50mph in sections of the network undergoing roadworks.

The Highways Agency, which is responsible for the nation’s main roads, is creating so-called ‘smart’ motorways where the hard shoulder can be used as an additional lane to help ease heavy traffic flow at peak times. 

A spokesman said: 'Variable speed limits on smart motorways are primarily there to smooth traffic flow, reduce congestion and make journeys more reliable.

'Hundreds of thousands of motorists use this stretch of the M25 every day. The vast majority are sticking to the speed limits and are experiencing better journeys as a result of smart motorways.

'There are clear signs where cameras are in place and the new cameras are more visible than the previous versions.'
