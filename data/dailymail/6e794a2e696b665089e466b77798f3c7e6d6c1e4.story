Rupert Murdoch joined scores of mourners paying their respects to war correspondent Marie Colvin at an intimate funeral in the New York community where she first decided to become a reporter.

Standing sombre-faced outside the Long Island service, the News Corp CEO forgot his own troubles to bid farewell to the journalist who had worked at his paper, The Sunday Times, for 27 years.

He was joined by John Witherow, the editor of the paper that Colvin was working for when she was killed by a rocket blast in Syria last month.

Bidding farewell: Rupert Murdoch, News Corp. CEO, leaves the funeral 
of Marie Colvin, who was working for The Sunday Times, which is owned by
 News Corp. when she was killed in Syria in February

Mourning: Marie Colvin's mother Rosemarie is embraced by a mourner as they arrive for the funeral service

Ceremony: Rosemarie Colvin walks at the head of the congregation as her 
daughter's coffin is carried into the St. Dominic Roman Catholic Church 
in Oyster Bay. Bagpipes played as the mourners walked to the church

Colvin's elderly mother Rosemarie, wept as she arrived at the funeral, before leading the congregation inside the St. 
Dominic Roman Catholic Church in Oyster Bay, where Colvin 
grew up.

Members of the congregation drove beneath a large American flag hung along the street to reach the ceremony. Bagpipes played Amazing Grace as they walked along the path towards the church.

A group of Sri Lanka immigrants gathered outside the church holding up a placard that described Colvin as the 'uncrowned queen of intrepid journalists'.

Inside, a portrait of the journalist in her signature eye patch - which she wore after losing her left eye in 2001 during the Sri Lankan civil war - and a book full of her newspaper articles were on display.

During the service, Colvin's best friend from college at Yale, Katrina Heron, told the 200 mourners that Colvin was 'full of passion, full of belief'.

She joked: 'She would probably say this was a bit sedate for her tastes. I think she'd take one look around and say "Can we move this party? I know a great little place down the road".'

Sadness: John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times, talks with reporters after the funeral service

Reflection: Murdoch and Witherow after the service. Colvin had worked for The Sunday Times since 1985

'Marie lived her wish to know that there
 was tenderness in the world,' Heron added. 'She lived it fully and she 
died for it. We are so proud of her.'

Guest pastor Dennis Mason, a cousin of Colvin, said: 'You risked yourself so many times over for those to whom no-one else would show mercy.

Remembered: Award-winning journalist Colvin, 56, was killed by a rocket blast in Syria on February 22

'Her first thought was never herself. 
She was the most respected, talented, compassionate, selfless journalist
 of her generation.'

The piper played Going Home as Colvin's coffin was taken from the church for a private cremation.

Leaving the church, Mr Murdoch called the service 'beautiful'.

Colvin was killed
 while covering the Syrian government's crackdown in the country where 
thousands of civilians have been killed since a popular uprising began a
 year ago.

Colvin, 56, had spoken her last words in a
 television dispatch from a village while watching a baby boy dying. 
She said seeing the horror might 'move people to think, why is this 
going on?'

In a final live broadcast with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, she explained the Syrians were shelling 'a city of cold, starving civilians'.

'It’s a complete and utter lie that they are only going after terrorists,' she added. 'There are no military targets here.'

It is fire that she succumbed to just hours later when a building that served as a makeshift media centre in the Baba Amr district of Homs was struck by an army mortar.

It is believed she died while trying to retrieve her shoes - which she had taken off to follow Middle Eastern custom - so she could escape the bombardment.

She was on the ground 
floor on when missiles hit the upper floors. With other journalists, she prepared to flee but they ran to grab their shoes first.

Colvin ran to the hall, where she had left hers, but when she got there,
 a rocket landed at the front of the building, a few yards away. The blast killed her and Remi Ochlik, a French photojournalist.

Other journalists - who included Paul Conroy, a photographer also working 
for The Sunday Times, three French nationals and a Spaniard - were 
covered in dust but unhurt.

The British government has ordered an 
investigation into Colvin’s death to build a war-crimes case against 
Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.

It
 proved a challenge to take Colvin’s remains out of Syria amid the 
violence. A Polish diplomat received her remains from the Syrian Red 
Crescent, flying them home to New York via Paris.

The eldest of her five siblings, she is survived by two brothers, two sisters, and her mother, who lived in East Norwich, Long Island, near Oyster Bay.

Days after the tragedy, Rosemarie 
Colvin told reporters her daughter - whom she described as hardworking 
and passionate - was on the verge of leaving the city as it was so 
dangerous.

Speaking from her home, Mrs Colvin said the Sunday Times editor had ordered Marie to leave the country. But 'she had to stay. She wanted to finish one more story.'

Mrs
 Colvin added: 'The reason I've been talking to all you guys is that I 
don't want my daughter's legacy to be "no comment' ... because she 
wasn't a "no comment" person.

'Her
 legacy is: Be passionate and be involved in what you believe in. And do
 it as thoroughly and honestly and fearlessly as you can.'
