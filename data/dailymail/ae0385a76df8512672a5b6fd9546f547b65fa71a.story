Warmer weather has melted much of the snow in Boston, but some remnants of the snowiest winter in the city's history refuse to leave.

One snow farm in Boston was photographed on Wednesday, now turned to a gross shade of grey with dirt and debris. According to Think Progress, the city will have spent some $50million hauling snow to farms like this at the end of the season.

But it looks like winter isn't quite over yet for Bostonians - or much of the East Coast. More snow is expected to hit the city on Friday, ironically timed for the first day of spring.

Isn't spring lovely? The snow in the mound was cleared from city's streets. Boston made history by having the snowiest, and probably most miserable, season since 1872

The snow system is expected to start falling over the northern Appalachians and southern Pennsylvania on Thursday night before reaching New York and southern New England on Friday.

New York City will see its first flakes around 9am on Friday and snow will continue to fall throughout the day - covering the city with two inches in total.

The snow is unlikely to settle, however, thanks to warmer ground temperatures. 

Nevertheless, the snow will likely hamper travel and create a headache of a commute on Friday,' John Homenuk of New York Metro Weather warned. 'Roads will be slick and travel will be hazardous when snow is falling. Be sure to leave extra time and bring your winter jacket.'  

No end: More snow is expected across the northeast on Friday and into the weekend as this winter shows no sign of easing up. Pictured, people use umbrellas against the snow in Boston last Sunday

'Temperatures will stay in the 30s, around 15 degrees lower than average for the time of year.

And in a bleak outlook for residents sick of the cold, Boston could get 1-3 inches of snow on Friday evening, as the white stuff falls across New England, northeast Pennsylvania and Upstate New York.

By Saturday, it will ease up in New England but will likely continue to cover western, central and Upstate New York, while New York City residents will still be battling temperatures in the 30s.

Over Boston, the snow will turn into rain through Saturday and Sunday.

Cold mix: The storm will bring wet snow to New England as it moves northeast throughout the weekend

New England residents will be pleased to hear they will not be getting the worst snowfall; instead central Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and the outskirts of New York City will see the most - as many as five inches.

The ongoing wintry mix comes as Boston set an all-time snowfall record. 

A storm this past weekend dropped 2.9 inches of snow at Logan International Airport, pushing the seasonal accumulation to 108.6 inches and surpassing the previous record of 107.6 set in 1995-96. 

The season snowfall record is measured from July 1 through June 30. Records go back to 1872.

'I wished I would have blocked the numbers from friends back in Southern California texting me screenshots of the 80-plus degree weather there,' said Matt Guerrieri who just moved to Boston. 

Ahead of the storm: The northeast is expected to get sun on Thursday and snow will start falling overnight

Cold: But on Friday, temperatures in New York will plunge as the icy weather hits the northeast

Winter weary: By Saturday, the storm will have moved further north and temperatures will warm again

But the snow that has already fallen didn't bury Bostonians' collective sense of humor.

Mayor Marty Walsh tweeted that the Boston yeti - a local who's been dressing up as the abominable snowman and walking around the city drawing laughs - would be taking over as interim mayor.

Bruce Mendelsohn, a Cambridge public relations executive, quipped, 'Boston has a rich tradition of leading the nation in the pursuit of liberty, freedom, sports titles and snowplows.' 

And there is more to come, weather.com reported.

'In snow-weary Boston, it's par for the course to pick up another 3-4 inches of snow after March 20,' it warned, adding that Bangor, Maine can expect another seven to eight inches of spring snow.
