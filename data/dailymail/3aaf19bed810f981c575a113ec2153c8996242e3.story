The body of an 18-year-old freshman at Penn State was found on Sunday morning after he fell or jumped from a construction site crane on the college campus, the weekend before he was set to begin classes.

Jack Crean's body was discovered on the pavement of the Hetzel Union Building-Robeson Center renovation project on the school's campus in State College, Pennsylvania, after a fall of roughly 85 feet.

Crean was found dead around 11am local time on Sunday by Penn State University Police.

Centre County Chief Deputy Coroner Judy Pleskonko said an autopsy was done late Sunday, and the cause of death was blunt force trauma. Pleskono said Crean died on impact.

'It's a sorrowful start to the academic year and our hearts go out to Jack’s family and friends,' University spokeswoman Lisa Powers said.

Toxicology reports are not expected for four to six weeks, but there is currently no evidence that Crean was intoxicated when this tragedy occurred.

Crean was due to begin his first classes today along with thousands of other incoming first-year students. 

Penn State's main campus has about 45,000 students, of whom about 35,000 are undergraduates.

'He was as loyal of a friend as you can find and all he ever wanted when he was with us was for us to be laughing and enjoying ourselves,' Penn State freshman Mitchell Walker, of State College, told the Centre Daily Times.

'He will be forever missed and never forgotten. I love that kid like a brother.'

The college freshman also excelled at business, this according to Sam Schwab, who graduated from State High, also located in State College, Pennsylvania, with Crean in 2014.

'Jack was always a good friend and had so much potential,' he said. 'Any time I had a question about something to do with business I would go to him. Everyone loved him because he was so outgoing and bright.'

Crean had just moved into a dormitory on the campus, according to Pleskonko. His death does not appear suspicious and an investigation has been launched, she said.
