The TSA agent who was shot dead by an authority-hating gunman at LAX on Friday once laughed and joked with Kris Jenner as he helped her through security at the busy airport.

A December 2012 video, which emerged today, shows a friendly 39-year-old Gerardo Hernandez chatting away to Jenner as he checks her documents and those of her companions.

Jenner, wearing a fur coat, chats back for about 30 seconds before moving through the security checkpoint and on to the screening area of the airport.

The video footage comes after it was revealed the LAX shooter was so bent on killing Hernandez that he returned to the TSA agent to finish the job after seeing him move.

Authorities said this weekend that Ciancia first walked up an escalator and away from the 39-year-old after riddling him with holes.

But when the shooter noticed the TSA agent move, he returned to see his mission through.

As first-degree murder charges were filed against Ciancia, it was revealed that the 23-year-old had hoped the attack would 'instill fear in their traitorous minds.'

In a news conference announcing charges against Ciancia, U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr spelled out a chilling chain of events inside LAX that began when Ciancia strode into Terminal 3 on Friday, pulled a Smith & Wesson .223-caliber assault rifle out of his duffel bag and fired repeatedly at point-blank range at Hernandez before the main screening area.

After killing the officer, Ciancia fired on at least two other uniformed TSA employees and an airline passenger, who were all wounded.

Airport police eventually shot him as panicked passengers cowered in stores and restaurants.

Coincidence: Kris Jenner, with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, met Hernandez at LAX in December 2012, around the time the couple announced their pregnancy

Victim: Gerardo I. Hernandez, left, was shot and killed by a gunman at the Los Angeles International Airport on Friday. He was caught on video helping Kris Jenner, right, through airport security a year ago

Family: Hernandez, seen in the center with a mustache, was the father of two children and is married

Tributes started to flow in for the 
hard-working airport staffer immediately after Hernandez was identified 
as the victim, with friends and family describing him as a loving 
husband and caring father who enjoyed spending his free time with his 
two children.

Hernanez's
cousin told friends on Facebook that he was destroyed by his death. 
Meanwhile, a different family friend told MailOnline she had known 
Hernandez's wife for years. The woman said Hernandez had worked at Los 
Angeles International Airport for three years before his death on 
Friday.

The Wrap has identified the victim's wife as Ana Machuca Hernandez, a marketing budget manager for Warner Brothers.

'It's devastating because he was such a great guy. All he talked about was his family,' Hernandez's friend Kevin Maxwell told NBC Los Angeles.

Maxwell said Hernandez was 'very proud' of his son and 'spoke profoundly' of his daughter.

A doctor at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center told NBC News that Hernandez was one of two shooting victims who were taken to the hospital, but there was no chance of his survival.

A round of shots broke into fragments inside his torso and caused chest injuries while setting off debilitating internal bleeding.

Targeted: Paul Ciancia, pictured, said in a note that he wanted to kill multiple TSA workers and show how easy it is to get a gun in an airport

Securing the scene: Police found a note near Ciancia's bag at the airport where he wrote about his anti-government leanings and signed it with a reference to a well-known conspiracy theory

'We made every effort to stop the bleeding and get the heart to beat on his own,' Dr David Plurad told the news station.

He was the first TSA agent ever to be killed at an airport while working for the government. 

'No
words can explain the horror that we experienced today when a shooter 
took the life of a member of our family and injured two TSA officers at 
Los Angeles International Airport,' TSA administrator John Pistole wrote
in a letter.

'Sadly, 
today marks the first incident where a TSA officer was killed in the 
line of duty. We can take some comfort knowing that the two injured 
officers are recovering from their wounds.'

City
officials have ordered several tributes be paid to Hernandez across Los
Angeles, as flags at all government-owned buildings in the area were be
flown at half mast.

LAPD officers also wore black bands on their police badges in his honor.

Ciancia is accused of walking into Los Angeles 
International airport on Friday morning and calmly removed a 
semi-automatic weapon from his duffel bag before opening fire at the 
security checkpoint where TSA agents examined traveler's passports.

He is believed to have targeted TSA 
agents specifically, using their bright blue uniforms as a way to 
distinguish them from the traveling masses.

Heartbroken: Ana Hernandez, whose husband Gerado was killed in the attack, said he loved his job with the TSA

Targets: Multiple witnesses recounted how he asked them if they worked for TSA, and when they said they did not he just continued walking. (This is not believed to be Hernandez, but another victim)

When
that was not enough to help him decide whether or not to shoot, Ciancia
asked individuals if they were members of the Transportation Security 
Administration. 

Traveler Leon Saryan who spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper about how he feels the gunman was clearly targeting TSA agents.

'I
was just getting ready to pick up my shoes and belt and pick up my 
other stuff... (when) people hit the ground and then started to run,' Mr
Saryan told CNN. 

He said while he was going to get his shoes that were waiting on the conveyer belt, a uniformed TSA agent 'grabbed the shoes and the two of us started running down the corridor towards the gate. This agent got hit... it seemed to be a grazing wound.'

At that point the agent kept running and seemed fine because the bullet hit him in the shoulder as Mr Saryan huddled in the corner, right when the gunman came up to him.

'(Suspect Paul Ciancia) looked at me and said "TSA?" I just shook my head and he kept going,' Mr Saryan told Anderson Cooper. 

'It was kind of hard to see his expression. I was more focused on the weapon.

'If I had a TSA uniform I wouldn't be here talking to you.'
