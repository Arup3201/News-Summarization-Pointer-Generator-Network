In an age where everyone is a digital photographer, one young artist has chosen to revert to a centuries-old technique to capture the 'soul' of his subjects.

Matt Albert, from Denver, has two life passions - skateboarding and photography, and in particular, photographing skateboarders. Discouraged by the 'meaninglessness of most digital images' he has found a technique that he says reconnects him to the process of truly capturing a person's character in a picture.

Using the traditional collodion process, Mr Alberts now plans to journey across the US in his newly converted motorhome-turned-dark-room, to capture the people he finds most fascinating - skateboarding 'lifers' - people from all walks of life who have devoted their lives to their love of the street sport.

Seeing into the soul: Mr Alberts says using collodion to photograph his skateboarding subjects allows him to see into their souls. Pictured, Kyleigh, from Boulder, Colorado, in a wet plate collodion image

He says his collodion black and white pictures 'see beneath the skin' of his subjects, because of collodion's 'sensitivity to see the UV light'.

'What better way to see these people in their rawest form and capture the real person inside,' he said.

In a video posted on his own website, Mr Albert says he has been devoted to both skateboarding and photography since the age of 10.

He bought his first skateboard at around the same time as picking up his first camera in a flea market.

Ever since, he has been fascinated and devoted to both.

'Dusty', from Riverdale, Utah, captured in 2004 using a wet plate collodion image, made by Quinn Jacobson. Wet plate collodion photography, invented in 1851, has experienced a resurge in recent years as photographers turn to this antiquated method for its moody, even haunting, images

'One of the things about photography that I have always loved is looking at old prints and wondering the story behind the photo.

'Looking at a good portrait should feel like you are catching a glimpse of a person's soul and gives you an immediate insight into their life.'

The best way of doing this, he says, is to revert back to using collodion to take pictures.

'In this digital world we get further and further away from the real meaning of photography.'

Escaping from this disconnect, Mr Alberts has invested his 'heart, soul and life savings' into this dream.

This circa 1856 collodion photo provided by Mr Alberts shows Lowell Gilmore at age 25 with his wife, Mary Eliza Gilmore, age 19, at a sitting in Albany, N.Y.

He has bought and converted a motorhome to act as his transport, home, and dark room.

And now he's hitting the road, to find and photograph skateboarding 'lifers'.

'To some, these poeple might be misconstrued as outcasts, but they are often some of the smartest people I have met,' he says.

'Lifers are a breed of people that eat, sleep and breath skateboarding just becasue they love it.

Processing: Using the collodion technique takes time and effort, unlike digital photography. Mr Alberts, pictured, has returned to this process 
to reconnect with the physical art of photography after being inspired by other local photographers' pictures

Lifetime investment: He has bought and converted a motorhome into a dark room and now Mr Alberts is driving across the US to find and photograph lifetime skateboarders using the centuries-old technique

'Regardless of age, social status or 
yearly salaries, lifers dedicate their lives to skateboarding and the 
lifestyle it has to offer.

'From our neighborus with backyard 
pools all the way to the legends that have skateboarding what it is 
today, lifers are the backbone of the skateboarding community.'

Now he is asking for help to support his dream to 'capture the essence of a true lifer'.
