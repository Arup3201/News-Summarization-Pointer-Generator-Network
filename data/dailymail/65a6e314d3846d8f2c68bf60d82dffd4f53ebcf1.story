Angie's List has announced it is canceling a $40 million expansion of its Indianapolis headquarters because of a new state law that critics say will promote discrimination based on sexual orientation.

Chief executive officer of Angie's List Bill Oesterle said in a statement Saturday that the decision is a result of Indiana Governor Mike Pence signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- aimed at preventing laws that 'substantially burden' a person's free exercise of religion.

The expansion of the online consumer ratings service's headquarters in the state capital was slated to revitalize the struggling Eastside neighborhood adding 1,000 jobs over five years, IndyStar reports.

The company was expected to break ground on the 'Ford Building Project' within days, but Oesterle said the project will be on hold until company officials 'fully understand the implications of the freedom restoration act on our employees, both current and future.'

'Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents,' Oesterle said in the statement.

The company is reviewing alternatives for the massive expansion. 

The company's news came as hundreds gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse Saturday rallying against the law, with some carrying signs reading 'no hate in our state.'

Dark Day: Oesterle tweeted 'Yesterday was a very dark day for Indiana. But, for me it was also a turning point. I intend to do something about it' 

Gov. Pence has received blow after blow from critics against the passing of the Act -- billed as a 'religious freedom' law -- who claim the law is a license to discriminate against gay people.

The widespread negative attention has even come from celebrities, journalists, authors, and politicians after being passed by the state's Republican-run legislature

The NBA, WNBA, the Indiana Pacers, and Indiana Fever issued a joint statement Saturday reaffirming their commitment to non-discrimination.

Among critics of the law is actor Ashton Kutcher who tweeted that the Act is an 'outrage.'

Hillary Clinton tweeted to her more than three million Twitter followers that 'we shouldn't discriminate against people because of who they love.' 

Angie's List isn't the only company taking a stand against the Act.

SalesForce CEO Marc Benioff plans to back up his more than 100 tweets against the Act by announcing that the global cloud computing company would cancel all events programs that would require the company to travel to Indiana, Recode reports.

Facing the firestorm of criticism, Gov. Pence told the Star he will support legislation to 'clarify' that the controversial law does not promote discrimination against gays and lesbians.  

OUTRAGE: Here, Ashton Kutcher tweets 'Indiana are you also going to allow Christian establishments to ban Jews from coming in? Or Vice Versa? Religious freedom???'

Oppression: John Green tweeted 'As a Hoosier, I'm deeply saddened and embarrassed. A government exists to protects its citisens; instead, it is legalizing their oppression' 

Everyone: Apple's Tim Cook tweeted that 'Apple is for everyone' and said the company is 'deeply disappointed' in Indiana's new law 

Un-American: Here, Harvey Fierstein calls the passage of the 'hate bill' 'UN-AMERICAN!'

Absurd and Insulting: Larry King tweeted that the bill signed by Gov. Pence is absurd and insulting
