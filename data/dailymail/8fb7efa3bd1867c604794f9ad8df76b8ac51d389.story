U.S. bounty hunters should not be allowed to raise the wreck of one of Britain's greatest warships and take some of the millions of pounds of gold it contains, it has today been claimed.

Leading archaeologists and descendants of the crew of HMS Victory, predecessor to Nelson's flagship, say that allowing it to be exploited for commercial gain would be a 'flagrant breach' of the military covenant and a betrayal of the more than 1,000 Royal Navy sailors who died. 

In 2008, the wreck was discovered by Odyssey Marine Exploration, a U.S. company, some 264 years after it sank in a storm off the Channel Islands.

US bounty hunters should not be allowed to raise the wreck of the HMS Victory and take some of the millions of pounds of gold it contains, it has today been claimed

It is believed it could contain gold worth hundreds of millions of pounds and 100 bronze cannon. 

The Ministry of Defence has said recovery could go ahead under the 'auspices of a charity'.

The Maritime Heritage Foundation, which was set up by Lord Lingfield, formerly Sir Robert Balchin a descendant of Admiral Sir John Balchen, the ship's commander, was founded for the purpose.

It has submitted plans to the MoD and Department for Culture, Media and Sport and agreed a contract with Odyssey which would give the firm 80 per cent of the value of coins and bullion and 50 per cent of the value of cultural artefacts.

The Government is expected to make an announcement soon on whether it will allow the proposals to go ahead.

 'There is only one opportunity to gather 
the unique evidence of our past from these 'time-capsules' of history 
and this should not be squandered for short-term financial gain.'

In a letter to the Daily Telegraph, Richard West, another descendant of Admiral Sir John Balchen, and Robert Yorke, chairman of the Joint Nautical Archaeology Policy Committee, said it 'represented the most inappropriate and distasteful kind of commercial exploitation.'

They said that any finds raised from the ship would be sold on the antiquities market for private gain.

They also said the Maritime Heritage Foundation had not got the relevant experience or discernible resources.

The committee said: 'The JNAPC's position is that historic wrecks in international waters should not be salvaged or excavated for commercial gain.

'Only if a wreck is under severe threat, or there is a clear research objective, should excavation take place. Otherwise the wreck should be left in situ. Most of these wrecks lie in very deep water and excavation techniques at depth using remote operated vehicles (ROV's) are in their infancy.

'Salvage today will almost certainly lead to the unnecessary loss of irreplaceable historical information. There is only one opportunity to gather the unique evidence of our past from these 'time-capsules' of history and this should not be squandered for short-term financial gain.'

Odyssey discovered the site nearly 100 km from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked on a reef near the Channel Islands

HMS Victory was lost in 1744 under the command of Admiral Sir John Balchen. The direct predecessor and inspiration behind Nelson's flagship, Balchen's Victory was the mightiest and most technically advanced vessel of her age

Experts say that if Victory, which sank on duty in 1744, were a 20th century vessel, it would be protected by sovereign immunity.

The vessel, predecessor of Nelson's famous flagship, went down in a storm off the Channel Islands in 1744, taking more than 1,000 soldiers to their deaths.

Along with a bronze cannon collection, some believe the ship was carrying a large quantity of gold coins from Lisbon to Britain, which would now be worth a reported £500 million.

The ship's location remained a mystery despite numerous searches, until Odyssey discovered the wreck in May 2008.

The Florida-based firm found the site 330ft under the English Channel, nearly 65 miles from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked, near the Channel Islands.

The Dutch financial publication Amsterdamsche Courant reported on November 18 1744, a month after the ship sank: 'People will have it that on board of The Victory was a sum of 400,000 pounds sterling that it had brought from Lisbon for our merchants.'

It was also thought that large quantities of silver and gold coins would have been on board The Victory from enemy prize ships captured by Balchin, worth 120,000 pounds sterling at the time.

The recovery of the ship would cost up to £25million.

Last year during a debate on Victory, Lord Renfrew said that a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) convention said the excavation of wrecks should not be financed by selling the items recovered.

The Cambridge University professor said to contravene it would be setting a terrible example.

He added that there were 'major ethical issues' involved, and that the Government were giving a poor and ill informed lead internationally in their dealings with Britain's underwater heritage.

Baroness Andrews, chairman of English Heritage, which sits on a committee to advise the MoD and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said the charity was concerned about Odyssey's proposed plans to manage the site.

She said: 'We do not believe that the proposals for the wreck are based on an adequate and authoritative assessment of its historical significance, nor a full understanding of the threats to and vulnerabilities of the site.

'We urge the Government to think hard about this, to recognise that our maritime heritage is an exceptional national asset, not an overseas commodity, and to act with resolve.'

Because the wreck is in international waters, it is not protected, Lord Lingfield said.

While he maintains that Odyssey is 'wholly reputable', it was at the centre of controversy after lifting 17 tons of silver coins from the wreck of a Spanish frigate sunk by the Navy in 1804 . It was ordered to return the cargo without compensation last year.

A U.S. judge said the ship should have lain undisturbed.
