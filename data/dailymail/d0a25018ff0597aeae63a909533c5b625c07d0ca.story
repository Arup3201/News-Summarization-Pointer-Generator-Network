Romance reunited? Cheryl Cole spent the night at her marital home with ex husband Ashley

Cheryl Cole has moved back in with her ex-husband Ashley, it emerged today.

The Girls Aloud star has spent the night at the couple's former £5million marital home in Surrey before the footballer went on holiday and has been lying low there during his trip abroad. 

Although the singer, who recently lost her judging spot on the U.S. version of The X Factor, stayed at the 12-bedroom pad - the pair are not said to have shared a room. 

The couple married in July 2006 but divorced last September.

'They were saying what a special night it was. They were mucking about like old times just playing pool, smoking and having a few drink,' a friend told the News of the World. 

‘There wasn’t any awkwardness between the two of them and they seemed very comfortable together.’

Following their reunion, the Chelsea footballer flew to America for his holiday leaving Cheryl there.

It is believed the singer had wanted to escape the huge media spotlight on her and the attention she was getting at her rented home in north London. 

A friend of the star is also quoted in News of the World, saying: ‘She knew Ashley was going away so it made sense to be there. The spent the night together and got on brilliantly. Who knows what will happen when Ashley gets back from his holiday.’

The news comes amid concerns over Cheryl’s well being after it was revealed the singer has been dropped from an exclusive royal dinner party.

Cheryl had apparently been planning 
to make her comeback at the event, held for the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge when they arrive in Los Angeles next month.

But her invitation to the party has now been withdrawn following her firing from the U.S. X Factor, it has been claimed.

A source told the News of the World: 'It's yet another blow for Cheryl and the last thing she needs at the moment. The whole of Hollywood wants an invite to this dinner.

'But without the X Factor, there is no reason for her to be there. It would have been the event where she shone with all America looking for the first time.'

And the 27-year-old singer, who is now said to have been replaced by TV chef Gordon Ramsay, apparently told friends she is planning on taking an indefinite break from the showbiz world.

Speaking through a friend, Cheryl is quoted as telling the Sunday Mirror: 'I need a break. I need to rest and I need to reassess what I’m doing with my life. I haven’t had a break for nine years and I’m exhausted from it all. For once now I am going to take some time out.

'I’ve not worked for a few weeks now and for once I don’t have to worry about anything. For once I can have some time for myself – not worry about X Factor, not worry about recording an album, not worry about anything.

Before the storm: Cheryl had been enjoying a series of public appearances, including a trip to the Cannes Film Festival (left), at the preliminary X Factor USA auditions and at a FOX party (right)

'Suddenly I’m under no pressure and I
actually feel the happiest I’ve felt in a long, long time. I’ve got a 
big place, I have enough money – and if I never get photographed again, I
don’t care.

'I’ve 
always had people saying "we need to put an album out, we need to record
it now" and "we have to rehearse for this tour and that tour’ and ‘now 
we need to do auditions for X Factor".

'I need to take a good few months off now – something I’ve never done before.'

And it seems Cheryl is determined to take her break behind closed doors, as the singer hasn't been seen for 25 days.

The last image of Cheryl was when she was seen putting on a brave face for the camera as she posed with a fan at the Cliveden Hotel in Berkshire just hours before her X Factor exit was announced.

A source told the Sunday People: 'Cheryl
doesn't deal with a crisis well. Behind the smiles and the glamour she 
can be quite insecure.

'Dealing with her marriage split was hard but her career was a massive help to her then. She also had Simon by her side and I think she thought he'd always be there for her, helping guide her through the pitfalls.

'So this has hit her very hard and she can't face the outside world at the moment.'

It has also been claimed that Cheryl 
has now moved out of her £3.1million north London home, and has taken 
her belongings to an international cargo facility.

The property, which comes complete with its own cinema, has apparently already been listed online.
