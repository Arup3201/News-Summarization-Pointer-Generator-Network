Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has delivered some harsh criticisms to President Barack Obama over recent controversies surrounding his administration in a speech.

Speaking to Virginia Republicans the Republican governor continued his push for punishments to be handed out to Internal Revenue Service officials that targeted conservative groups in the lead-up to the 2012 election.

CNN says Jindal addressed the IRS’ extra scrutiny of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status, saying those involved in the targeting should 'go to jail'.

Criticism: Louisana Governor Bobby Jindal is calling for jail time for members of the IRS involved in the targeting of conservative groups

Knowledge: The Obama administration knew about investigation into claims that the IRS was harassing tea party groups since June 2012 as the ousted head of the agency, Steven Miller , insists it was not illegal

'Anyone who participated in this targeting of Americans for their political beliefs, anyone who knew about it, anyone who simply looked the other way, and anyone under whose watch this occurred needs to be fired,' Jindal said, noting that ordinary citizens who fail to pay taxes could face jail time.

'But in this instance, it is the IRS, people in a position of public trust, who have violated the Constitution of the United States of America.

You cannot take the freedom of law-abiding Americans, whether you disagree with them or not, and keep your own freedom.

When you do that, you go to jail,' Jindal iterated.

Presidential aspirations:? Jindal has already visited New Hampshire this year and now he is in Virginia making some to wonder whether he has designs on the White House come 2016

Fighting words: Mitt Romney has also been speaking out against the president, lambasting him for the Obama administration's handling of the IRS controversy

In a letter to the president on Tuesday, Jindal and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, chairmen of the Republican Governors Association, called for a special prosecutor to investigate the IRS.

'Anyone who believes that this White House, or this Justice Department run by Eric Holder, is willing or capable of investigating this scandal is unhinged from reality,' Jindal said.

'This president has grown the size, the scope, the debt, and the power of the federal government to such irresponsible proportions…that this is the inevitable result,' Jindal said of the IRS controversies.

Jindal is among a handful of Republicans thought to have presidential aspirations in 2016.

The various speaking engagements that he is undertaking include an event in New Hampshire last week are fueling speculation that he may be considering a run for the presidency.

Former Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney said 'a special counsel should be appointed' to investigate the incident, putting some of the blame on Obama.

'The IRS reports to the Treasury Department, that reports to the president. The buck stops at the president's desk,' Romney said.

President Barack Obama called the scandal 'outrageous.'
