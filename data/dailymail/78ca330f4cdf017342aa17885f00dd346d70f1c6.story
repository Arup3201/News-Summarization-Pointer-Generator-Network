A German Shepherd dog has become world famous for her insolence after her owner posted a video of her throwing a theatrical tantrum to YouTube.

Bella was having such a great time playing in the lake that she simply refused to go home when called. When her owner announced 'Time to go Bella,' she threw a tantrum like a toddler; howling at her owner and the sky, swimming away from shore in circles and pounding the water with her paws. 

One viewer commenting on the clip said this is typical German Shepherd behaviour. 'German Shepherds are known for being vocal to the point it can be a conversation,' they posted.

The engaging performance earned Bella a few more precious moments in water and more than 1.5 million YouTube hits.

After posting the video to You Tube, Bella's owner Laura Gibbs says she's been accused of animal abuse.

'I have been accused of everything under the sun, including abuse and that I'm starving her to death etc. based on a 2 min video. It amazes me the number of "dog whisperers" there are in the world that know her better than I do,' she posted to You Tube.

'She's a very vocal German Shepherd and had a meltdown, and it cracked me up. I don't think it makes me a bad pet owner as so many people have accused me of being', wrote Gibbs, adding 'No dogs’ hearts were actually broken in the making of this video.'
