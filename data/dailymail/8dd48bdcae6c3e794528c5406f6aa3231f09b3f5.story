No matter how you dress them up, Brussels sprouts are one Christmas tradition that many children could do without.

Over the years, attempts have been made to improve the flavour, adding sweet glazes, chestnuts or pieces of smoked bacon, but in many, many cases to no avail.

Now Waitrose has worked with growers in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire to develop two varieties that they insist are ‘kid-friendly’.

Charlie Heath, four, says he likes these Brussels sprouts, but not 'the yukky ones Mummy makes'

According to scientists, children are not just being fussy when it comes to the knobbly sprout - reluctance to wolf them down stems from survival instinct, as harmful toxins tend to have a bitter taste, just like sprouts

The kid-friendly sprout, which has a nuttier, sweeter taste, hits Waitrose shelves next week for a limited period, and it is hoped that children themselves will be piling them into the parental shopping trolley

Importantly, they have a milder and less bitter taste, making each mouthful a sweeter experience.

The poor little sprout is often rejected by people both little and large alike due to its perceived bitter taste, so the supermarket giant has worked secretly with its farmers over the past year to create a milder flavour sprout that is low on bitterness and high on sweetness.

The Waitrose 'kid-friendly' sprout will arrive in branches this week for a limited period in the run up to Christmas.

According to scientists, children are not just being fussy when it comes to the knobbly sprout.

Reluctance to wolf them down stems from survival instinct, as harmful toxins tend to have a bitter taste, just like sprouts.

Sweetness, on the other hand, usually indicates that something is safe to eat, which is why children adore biscuits, cakes and Haribo.

But there is a good reason why parents ought to urge their little poppets to eat Brussels sprouts: they have twice as much vitamin C per 100g than oranges do, approximately 115mg as opposed to 54mg.

Amy Lance, Chief Sprout Taster at Waitrose says: 'The humble Brussels sprout is a wonderful bundle of deliciousness, but so often overlooked by children or picky eaters.

'We have worked hard over the past year to develop this sprout which we believe will win over even the most ardent sprout haters. We hope it will get a massive thumbs up from children this Christmas and encourage them to "eat their greens".'

Charlie Heath, age four, said: 'I like these sprouts. I don't like the yucky ones my Mummy cooks.'

Over the course of the sprout season Waitrose will sell approximately 15 varieties of sprouts, including the flower sprout and red sprout.

Sprouts are at their best now and this dish is packed with festive flavour.

the chestnuts and sugar, tossing in the pan, then add the stock and 
reduce by half.

Add the sprouts and pancetta back to the pan and warm through to serve.

Brussels sprouts sales are booming and prices are falling, which means the traditional festive favourite is set for a revival this year, new industry figures show.

Better weather this season has led to a bumper crop of the vegetables that children love to hate at Christmas, which means better supplies, lower prices and bigger sales, it reveals.

Year-on-year sales are up 23 per cent by volume and 18.5 per cent by value, said analysts Kantar, looking at the most recent trading period covering 12 weeks to mid November.

This is a major recovery on the same time last year when bad weather had led to a failed crop which in turn saw prices rise just as households were cutting budgets.

But this year's glut, after warmer, drier, weather means prices are coming down in time for Christmas.

The average price of sprouts from the suppliers to the shops has come down from £3.88 a kilo a year ago to £3.59 a kilo last month, said Kantar in the trade journal The Grocer.

This may not seem a big fall but at a time when many food and drink products are rising in price, it will be welcomed by shoppers more used to price rises than falls.

And supermarkets are expected to use the falling price in their own special deals to entice Christmas shoppers.

Richard Mowbray of commercial suppliers TH Clements told The Grocer: 'We have seen an increase in promotional activity versus the same period last year and also some deflation which has helped to push volume.'

Andrew Ovens of suppliers Produce World Group added: 'Unless this changes as we move into the peak season, sales should continue on this trajectory.'

The good news comes as the humble sprout itself is changing with innovations including a sweeter version to tempt children, an M&S sprout/kale hybrid and a sprout flavoured Christmas cake from Ocado.
