A Florida mom whose son got on the honor roll with a report card that said things like ‘good job!’ had the opposite reaction from most parents: she complained.

That’s because Beth Tillack’s son had actually made one C and one D grade on his report card and still managed to make the honor roll.

‘It doesn't make any sense,’ Tillack said.

'It doesn't make any sense': Florida mom Beth Tillack was aghast when her son's report card said 'good job' and won him a spot on the honor roll despite his getting a C and a D

Tillack’s son had several A grades in addition to his two less than stellar marks.‘I immediately assumed it's a mistake,’ Tillack told WPTV.

But it wasn’t. The A grades managed to offset the C and D in the point system used to determine who makes it to the honor roll.

By the Pasco County system, even students with an ‘F’ can get onto the honor roll so long as they get enough A’s as well.

Broken system? Pasco Middle School Principal Kim Anderson says that honor roll is awarded based on a point system and even students who get Fs are still eligible

'It makes my job at home so difficult': Tilleck said the Florida school's policy sets a bad example for the kids and complained to administrators

‘The bottom line is, there is nothing honorable about making a D,’ Tillack said. ‘How can I get my child to study for a test when he thinks he’s done enough?’

In response to Tillack’s complaints, the school took back her son’s original report card and returned it with less glowing remarks.

‘Work on civics,’ it now reads. ‘Ask for help.’

While she said the positive comments are something the school has done since the 1990s, Pasco Middle’s principal Kim Anderson admitted she doesn’t totally support the point system for honor roll.

‘I do think it's important that we look at the situation,’ Anderson said.

According to WPTV, the school has now put the policy under review.

'Work on civics!' In response to Tilleck, the school reissued her son's report card and Anderson said the policies for honor roll would be re-evaluated
