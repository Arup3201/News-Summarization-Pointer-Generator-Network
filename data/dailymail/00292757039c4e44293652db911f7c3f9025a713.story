Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie's first joint Royal engagement ended successfully today as flag-waving children turned out to greet them in the rain.

Following in the footsteps of their 
father Prince Andrew - dubbed 'Airmiles Andy' because of all his free 
flights when he was UK trade envoy - the princesses were there to launch the 
Great Britain 
Mini tour across Germany.

The trip showcased the very best of 
British, from culture and technology to music and innovation, and ended with a trip to Hanover today for the re-opening of Schloss Herrenhausen, the city’s palace which has finally been rebuilt after it was destroyed by allied bombardment in 1943.

They even came in for a gentle 
ribbing from the German press who covered the two-day engagement with 
bemusement and mild curiosity.

'The Berlin trip of the Merry Wives of Windsor', cried the Berliner Kurier's headline, before introducing the princesses as 'young ladies in heels that looked like school girls'.

After
a recap of exactly who they were ('No.5 and No.6 in line to the 
throne'), readers were reminded of Beatrice's biggest claim to fame yet -
the wearing of that Phillip Treacy hat to the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge's wedding.

Presents galore: Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie are presented with gifts by Mayor of Hanover Stephan Weil at Hanover City Hall

'She sat at the ceremony directly behind 
Queen Elizabeth II, 86, and wore a crazy hat, which was later auctioned 
for Unicef for €90 000,' it read.

The royal sisters were in Berlin to 
work on the Great Campaign - a global initiative to attract visitors, 
business and students to the UK.

The paper went on to add that they 'charmed their way through Berlin, vigorously beating the drum for their country.'

The Sueddeutsche newspaper referred to the princesses as 'hatless missionaries' of 'quasi-B prominence among the young Royals - after the A-list to the Princes Harry and William and pregnant Kate.'

It said they were on a 'patriotic mission' and jokingly remarked how it was strange that the Princess  chose not to wear hats when they were both famous for their 'extravagant hat creations.'

It went on to say that Beatrice 'did 
everything to make up for the lack of headgear - and even welcomed the 
journalists with a few German words.'

The
sisters were on the final day of their two-day tour of Germany and 
spent it in Hanover where they were met by small crowds waving the Union
flag before listening to a speech by Mayor of Hanover Stephan Weil at 
Hanover City Hall.

They were in attendance for the opening of Herrenhausen Palace in Hanover which was rebuilt by the Volkswagen Foundation for 21 million euros after it was destroyed in WW II .

They also visited the Equine Clinic at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Hanover where they fed a horse with a heart condition called Ben.

The Royal Family have strong ties with Germany as Queen Victoria's mother was German, as was her husband Prince Albert.

The Princesses raised eyebrows yesterday after they drove the Mini through a red light near Berlin’s 
Brandenburg Gate on their short journey to the British Embassy.

With photographers and police in tow,
driver Eugenie and her older sister Beatrice then took a swift right 
into the safety of the British embassy compound.

But the royals had not embarrassed their
hosts, they had been waved through by German officers who had also 
blocked off part of the road.
