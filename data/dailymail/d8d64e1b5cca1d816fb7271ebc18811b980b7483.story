Coleen Rooney was heartbroken last night after the death of her ‘special angel’ sister at the age of just 14.

Rosie McLoughlin died in the early hours of yesterday. She had faced a lifelong battle with Rett syndrome, a rare brain disorder that causes severe disabilities.

Coleen had been on holiday in Barbados with her younger brothers, Joe and Anthony, but cut short the trip when she heard that Rosie’s condition had deteriorated.

A statement last night from the 
McLoughlins said: ‘Sadly our special angel Rosie, our much-loved 
daughter and sister, went to Heaven at 2.50 this morning at home where 
she was surrounded by her loving family.

‘Rosie was just 14 years old and 
fought a lifelong battle with Rett syndrome. Throughout her life she 
brought so much love and happiness to all our family and everyone who 
knew and met her.

‘She was such a strong little girl 
and an inspiration to us all. We shall cherish for ever the memories  we
 have shared and the love she showed us each and every day of her life. 
As a family we are heartbroken but we are blessed to have had her in our
 lives.’

'Sadly our special angel Rosie, our 
much-loved daughter and sister, went to heaven at 2.50am this morning at
 home, where she was surrounded by her loving family.

'Rosie was just 14 years old, and fought a life-long battle with Rett syndrome.

Throughout her life she brought so much love and happiness to all our family and everyone who knew and met her.

'She
 was such a strong little girl and an inspiration to us all. We shall 
cherish forever the memories we have shared and the love she showed us 
each and every day of her life.

'As a family we are heartbroken, but we are blessed to have had her in our lives.

'The
 family would like to thank everyone involved in Rosie's life for their 
love and support and for their messages of heartfelt condolence today.

'We
 would also like to thank the many doctors, consultants, nurses, helpers
 and friends who all worked so hard and tirelessly to help make Rosie's 
life better. In particular, we thank everyone at Alder Hey Hospital and 
Claire House Children's Hospice.

'There will be no further statements from the family at this time.'

Coleen, 26, was said to idolise her 
adopted sister and chose Rosie as chief bridesmaid when she married 
Manchester United and England footballer Wayne Rooney in 2008.

Last night she took to Twitter to express her sorrow, writing: ‘We are absolutely heartbroken to have lost our angel Rosie.

‘So glad we ended our holiday short, 
due to her deteriorating & we was able to spend the last few days 
together with her and our family! Sleep tight Rosie Mc x. We love you 
more than words can say x.’

Rosie was originally taken in as a 
foster child by Coleen’s parents, bricklayer Tony and Colette, a former 
nursery nurse, when she was two. Although they were aware she was 
disabled they did not know the full extent of her condition, which has 
no cure.

In an exclusive article for The Mail 
on Sunday in 2006, Coleen wrote: ‘When Rosie arrived she could crawl, 
and even though she couldn’t use her hands that much she would handle 
toys on her play mat and she could eat.

‘But over a period of time she 
stopped crawling and lost what use of her hands she had. Then she 
started having problems swallowing her food.

‘It took pretty much a year for Rosie
 to be diagnosed and, looking back, I can see how much Mum pushed to 
find out what was wrong with her and to try to do what was best for 
her.’

It was a heartfelt and moving tribute
 to her sister who, she said, ‘can’t talk to us but you can tell when 
she’s happy – she laughs and giggles and her eyes sparkle’.

The Rooneys now have a three-year-old
 son, Kai, and their second son is due in May. Because Rosie was 
adopted, there is no chance of Coleen passing Rosie’s genetic condition 
on to her unborn child.

Her mother Colette has said: ‘Coleen 
idolises Rosie and Rosie idolises Coleen  . . .  when Coleen walks into 
the room Rosie’s  eyes light up.’

Coleen made a TV  documentary about 
the funding of  children’s hospices to raise awareness of places such as
 Claire House in Liverpool, where Rosie stayed two nights a week.

In last night’s statement the family thanked staff at Claire House, and also Alder Hey Children’s Hospital.

Rett syndrome is a rare and incurable genetic disorder that causes severe physical and  mental disability.

Affecting about 1 in every 12,000 girls – and only much more rarely seen in boys – it is usually diagnosed in early childhood when infants fail to develop normally or begin losing basic skills they have already learned.

Sufferers can live to the age of 40 but about 95 per cent survive only until they are 25.

The condition involves a mutation in a specific gene which affects  the way the brain develops and prevents other genes from working in the correct way.

Initially symptoms can be vague, but include speech problems and losing the use of the hands. Some children stop using eye contact and lose interest in toys.

A period of rapid degeneration follows which can last several months.

Children will usually need round-the-clock care and will be unable to do even the simplest tasks on their own. Many will be unable to walk, talk or focus and some will develop symptoms not unlike autism.

A third stage, where symptoms plateau, can then last for many years. Some will remain in this state for the rest of their lives.

Many will suffer regular seizures and severe motor problems but their condition will not deteriorate.

There is no cure, and treatment involves managing the symptoms.

Medication may be needed for breathing problems and motor difficulties, and anti-epileptic drugs may be used to control seizures. Those at risk of dying from the syndrome will usually have experienced severe seizures, swallowing difficulties and greatly reduced mobility. Other sufferers can die from pneumonia.

Because the condition is so  rare – and because the majority  of sufferers do not go on to have children – it is not known if it is hereditary. However, it is thought the chances of parents having a second child with the condition are about one per cent.
