Driving under the influence of drugs is illegal, but until now police officers have had to wait for blood tests to confirm whether a driver is high, which can take up to 24 hours.

Now, scientists have developed a cannabis-detecting breathalyser that  generates results almost immediately.

Researchers at Washington State University came up with the handheld breathalyser to detect THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.

Scientists have come up with a cannabis-detecting breathalyser that could be used on the roadside, and help police charge people with drug-driving offences more easily

The gadget uses ion-mobility technology, which is used by airport security professionals to detect drugs and explosives, The Seattle Times reported.

The prototype device, which could be tested on humans as soon as next year, is not designed to detect how stoned a driver is, but simply to confirm whether they have THC in their system. 

Researchers at Washington State University came up with the handheld breathalyser to detect THC (illustarted), which is the psychoactive ingredient in pot, which is not found in alcohol

THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects.

It bonds to receptors on nerve cells, which respond by changing in activity.

The cannabinoid receptors are found in areas of the brain linked to memory, cognition, pleasure, coordination and the perception of time.

THC stimulates cells in the brain to release dopamine, creating a happy feeling, but can also cause hallucinations, delusions and affect rational thinking.

On average, the effects last for around two hours.

The idea is, that is the chemical was detected, a driver would be given a blood test, which could then be used as evidence in court.

Taking drugs affects people's driving skills, and can give them slower reaction times, nausea, hallucinations, panic attacks, paranoia, 'the shakes,' dizziness, fatigue and the affects their ability to concentrate properly, which could increase their chance of having a road accident.

Washington State University’s research could soon help out the Washington State Patrol, which have said that a quarter of blood samples taken from drivers in the area in the last year tested positive for cannabis.

The state legalised cannabis two years ago and in 2013, 1,362 drivers tested positive for having active cannabis in their system – 25 per cent more than the previous year.

It is estimated that 720 of these people had THC levels high enough to lead to an automatic drugged driving conviction under state law.

The Washington State Patrol says it welcomes anything that gets impaired drivers off the road.

It's illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol and other drugs, including cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine, in the UK. 

Just one puff of cannabis puts a driver over the limit.

The police ask drivers to do a 'field impairment assessment' to assess their ability to drive and can then arrest anyone who they suspect of driving under the influence, before taking them to do a blood test.

If the test comes back positive, drivers could be charged with a crime.

Penalties for drug driving include: A minimum 12 month driving ban, criminal record, a fine of up to £5,000 and/or six months in prison.
