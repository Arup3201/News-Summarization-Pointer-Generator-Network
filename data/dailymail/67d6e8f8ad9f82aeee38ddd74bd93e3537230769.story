A Philadelphia man has been arrested in the stabbings of two members of rapper Nicki Minaj's tour, one of whom died.

Authorities say 31-year-old Pierce Boykin was arrested Monday on charges of attempted murder, aggravated assault and related offenses. 

Police Capt James Clark said more arrests could come. Last week, authorities said they were looking for two suspects.  

The double stabbing on Wednesday left 29-year-old Devon Pickett dead and a second member of Minaj's tour, 27-year-old Eric Parker, severely wounded.

Police sources told Philly.com that Boykin critically injured Parker, and that Pickett was killed by another assailant in the same fight. 

Police say the stabbing occurred outside a bar after the victims argued with a man inside, allegedly over a woman.

According to Minaj, the crew members had arrived in Philadelphia only two days earlier to rehearse for a tour.

Boykin or an attorney for him could not be reached Tuesday to comment on the charges. 

Minaj shared the news of the fatal bar fight on Twitter last week, writing; 'Two members of my team were stabbed last night in Philly. One was killed. They had only been there for two days rehearsing for the tour.' 

She also called the incident 'another senseless act of violence that took the life of a great guy.' 

Parker is expected to survive the incident. 

Scene: It has now been revealed that Pickett and Parker were fighting with the rival group over a female bartender who works at Che Bar & Grill, near where the altercation happened 

It has now been revealed that the fight was over a female bartender who worked at the restaurant where Pickett, Parker and friends dined Tuesday night.

When they were leaving Che Bar & Grill early the next morning, Minaj's employees got in a confrontation with a group of local men on the sidewalk outside.

It's alleged that both Parker and a man from the rival group were both dating the female bartender.

'Both of the parties  knew a female who worked at the bar, and the arguments centered around her,' Capt Clark told WPVI. 

When she came out, Parker's group tried to escort her to the car.

The situation escalated when Parker asked the woman if she was ok and someone in the other group pulled out a knife. 

Music veteran: Pickett (above) had worked in the music industry for years, helping out on tours for Rihanna and singer K. Michelle

Both men were in town to rehearse for Minaj's European tour, which begins next month in support of her new album The Pinkprint.

Rihanna also paid tribute to Pickett, who previously worked on her tour, writing; 'Can't believe this is true! one of the nicest, coolest, funniest people I've ever met and toured with! We had so much fun together!!! Sad to lose a beautiful spirit like yours#RIPDayDay.' 

Rapper Fabolous also paid tribute, writing; 'My heart is heavy right now... God opened my eyes this morning at 9:49am. For some reason at that time I woke up thinking about both of these guys. They both work with me, but I couldn't figure out why they were in my mind at 1st wake up. Wasn't sure if I had a dream & they were in it or just some wake up & process things type shit.. But at 10:04 my brother hit me & told me...

'My friend died & my friend Eric Parker is in critical condition in the hospital fighting for his life. I am still in shock & don't want to believe this. And it hurts even more knowing how good these two dudes are. How hard these guys work. And how loyal they are to whoever they are down with & each other. Please send Eric Parker your blessings & a prayer for him to pull thru.

Tour manager to the music stars: Pickett also worked with K. Michelle (both above) on her first tour

'And RIP to the fallen soldier Day Day. I can't even believe I'm saying that with your name attached to it. & I HATE this being a post!! I will miss your energy, your vibe, & you but I'll hold on to your spirit!! ' 

Singer K. Michelle wrote; 'I'm in real shock. Woke up this morning to some awful news that you passed. My heart is broken. You managed my first tour ever the Rebellious Soul Tour. 

'You Were so supportive and excited about the growth of my career. When are we going to stop killing eachother? They don't even know they took away one of the best. You've guided so many careers. The road for many artist won't be the same. My heart hurts. Praying for your family and I know you are in a better place.'

Pusha T also remembered Pickett; 'It's killing me to talk abt you in the past tense. I don't believe I've ever met someone as selfless as you. No one as humble and for the team as you. I hired you as my road manager simply because I knew you were more honest than me. 

'There were stronger, more experienced, more polished candidates for the job but they weren't better than you. You made me see good in people. You gave everyone a chance, they should've gave you a chance. You didn't deserve this. Love you.'
