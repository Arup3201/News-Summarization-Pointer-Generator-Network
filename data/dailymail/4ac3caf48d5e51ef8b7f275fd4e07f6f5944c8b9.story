A host of Formula One drivers managed to find time to relax during their flight back from the inaugural Russian Grand Prix on Sunday after a tough week for the F1 world.

Title leader Lewis Hamilton, who has now won the past four races, dominated the race to extend his advantage over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to 17 points in the drivers’ championship.

The likes of Jenson Button, Rosberg and Daniel Ricciardo were joined on the flight by former driver David Coulthard and Eddie Jordan.

The drivers looked to be enjoying a well-deserved drink on the flight having had to cope with Marussia driver Jules Bianchi’s horror crash at the Japanese Grand Prix last weekend.

All the drivers paid tribute to Bianchi before the start of the Russian Grand Prix on Sunday as the Frenchman is in a critical but stable condition in a Japanese hospital.

The American Grand Prix is up next on November 2, with a three-week break for the drivers before the race at the Circuit of the Americas, where Hamilton will hope to continue his winning streak.
