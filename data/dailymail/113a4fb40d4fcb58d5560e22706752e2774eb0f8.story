They were an obscure, short-lived 1970s rock band whose only achievement was an undistinguished second place in a Perth talent contest.

But now, 35 years after they split up, a single recorded by Scots group Glory Hunter has become one of the world’s most sought-after records, with copies changing hands for more than £1,000.

Back in 1979, the four members of the outfit from Livingston, West Lothian, pooled their resources to record debut single Thoughts of Destiny but they split up only weeks later.

Then and now: Former lead singer Kenny Hanlon in 1979 with Rough Edge, the band he was in before Glory Hunter and right, the 59-year-old with the band's highly sought after record Thoughts of Destiny

The band pooled their resources to record Thoughts of Destiny, now a collectors item, but split up soon after

Now, to the great surprise of former lead singer Kenny Hanlon, records from the run of 1,000 have become highly sought after, with one expert describing them as ‘rarer than hen’s teeth’.

One copy fetched £1,090 on eBay in 2011 and another is the most valuable single listed on collectors’ site 991.com, its £895 price tag outstripping classics by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Springsteen. 

Grandfather and father-of-five Mr Hanlon, 59, said yesterday: ‘I suppose I should be chuffed, but to be honest I’m more mystified.

‘I’ve absolutely no idea why a single by an unknown band from Scotland that fell apart a few weeks after recording their only single should be so valuable.

‘When I first saw the record had sold for over £1,000 on eBay I thought it was a wind-up. I couldn’t take it in.

‘We had 1,000 copies pressed and we paid for the whole thing ourselves. We didn’t have a record deal or anything.

‘We sold a few copies at gigs but the band split up before we had a chance to get a distribution deal.’

In early 1979 Mr Hanlon, then aged around 24, joined the band which comprised guitarist Derek Hawthorne, Tam Mollins on bass and drummer Stuart Tennant.

They played a handful of concerts and took part in a Scottish Rock Band of the Year competition in Perth, where they came second to an ELO tribute act.

Mr Hanlon said: ‘We were quite organised and we decided to finance the single ourselves. We paid for the studio time, the pressing, everything.

‘But there were already tensions within the band when I joined and a few weeks after the single came out the bass player and the drummer left.

‘Let’s just say there were a few musical differences and personality problems going on.’

Jon Ashby of 991.com said: ‘There is very little information for this release. It was an extremely limited press and sold by the band only at their gigs and comes in a plain company sleeve as there were no picture sleeves produced.

‘Very few rock fans have even heard of Glory Hunter. They were categorised in a movement which became known as the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which was spearheaded by Iron Maiden.

‘It’s unusual for such a little-known band to become so collectible. Copies of this single are rarer than hen’s teeth.’
