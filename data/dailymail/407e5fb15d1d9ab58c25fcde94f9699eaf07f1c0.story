Fleeing: Katia Wanzeler was arrested while trying to leave the country at JFK airport on Wednesday night. She is the wife of fugitive accused Ponzi schemer Carlos Wanzeler

The wife of an accused $1 billion Ponzi schemer was arrested at New York's JFK airport Wednesday as she boarded an international flight.

Katia Wanzeler's husband Carlos Wanzeler, 45, co-owner of Boston-area telecommunications firm TelexFree, was accused by federal authorities in April of bilking investors and has since fled to his home country of Brazil.

Katia Wanzeler, whose name appeared on some of the checks amounting to $38 million that were found when her husband's partner James Merrill was arrested was arrest last week, was brought in on a material witness warrant.

The 
Massachusetts State Department said that it had notified judges in 
Nevada, where the company has filed for bankruptcy, of their civil suit 
against Telexfree, which promoted itself as an internet phone company 
with offices in Marlborough, Massachusetts, and Brazil.

The
 action seeks to get money back for Telexfree investors. Just in 
Massachusetts, the company made $90 million, plus millions more 
overseas, officials said.

'The
 scope of this alleged fraud is breathtaking,' U.S. Attorney Carmen 
Ortiz said. 'As alleged, these defendants devised a scheme which reaped 
hundreds of millions of dollars from hard working people around the 
globe.'

Ponzi scheme? TelexFree billed itself as a VoIP company, but authorities say new investments were only passed along to older investors

Brian
 McNiff, spokesman of Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, 
said the courts in Nevada have been informed of the case that the judge 
would take that into account when he decides on the issue.

Galvin
 has accused Telexfree of operating a pyramid scheme, as it did not sell
 any actual product and promised exorbitant profits in exchange for 
posting ads on the Internet. In order to gain from their investments, 
clients were asked to pay between $289 and $1,375. Officials say the 
company paid them with the money brought in by the new investors.

The next court date between Telexfree and its creditors has been scheduled for May 22 in Nevada.

When
 it filed for bankruptcy, Telexfree said it had assets of between $50 
million and $100 million. The news of its bankruptcy spread fast and 
provoked panic among investors.

Many
 of the investors were Brazilian immigrants in the Boston area, but the 
company had offices or representatives in other Latin American countries
 and even in Africa. Complaints about the company have surfaced on 
social media sites from places including the Dominican Republic, Peru, 
Ecuador and Uganda.
