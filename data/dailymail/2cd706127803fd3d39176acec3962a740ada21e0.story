With less than two years to go until the 2016 Olympics open in Brazil, it was crunch time for Zara Phillips as the World Equestrian Games in Normandy began.

The competition, which is one of the most prestigious in the eventing world, will take place in front of the selectors who will choose the team for Rio 2016.

Despite the high stakes, Zara, 33, looked relaxed as she put her bay gelding High Kingdom through his paces in the first horse inspection ahead of the main event.

Laughing and chatting with team member and world number one, William Fox-Pitt, the nerves clearly had yet to kick in.

From tomorrow, however, it will be all business as she battles it out with some of the best eventers in the world, knowing only a brilliant performance will guarantee her a place in the team alongside the likes of Fox-Pitt and veteran rider, Mary King.

Back to the day job: Zara will compete with Team Great Britain at the World Equestrian Games in France next week and hopes to secure her team's place at the 2016 Olympics

Going for gold: Zara told the BBC this week that she and her team want to make sure they've got that Olympic qualification as well as bring back some medals

Tense: The World Equestrian Games are held every four years and the top six nation's teams in the team eventing contest, the top five showjumping teams and the top three dressage and para-dressage teams will qualify 

Dreams: Zara recently explained that securing Britain's place at the Olympics would be 'huge'

Zara has been working hard in the run up to the Normandy competition, with regular appearances on courses all over the UK in recent months.

Her determination to do well hasn't entirely put a stop to her social life however - just last month, she was seen enjoying the action alongside Tom Cruise at the Glorious Goodwood race meet on the Sussex Downs.

She also found time to put in an appearance at Royal Ascot, joined by husband Mike Tindall and cousin Prince Harry in June, as well as taking time out for Prince George's first birthday celebration late last month.

Alongside Mr Tindall, she and baby daughter Mia were seen being driven into Kensington Palace for George's Peter Rabbit themed first birthday party.

Crunch time: Zara prepares to battle it out for a place in the GB team for Rio 2016

Happy to be back on the saddle: Zara, who recently became a mother to baby Mia with Mike Tindall, looked thrilled to be back with High Kingdom
