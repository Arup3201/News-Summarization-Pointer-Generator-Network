The Manchester City players looked to be in high spirits as Manuel Pellegrini took his side for an open training session in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.

The Premier League champions flew to the Far East shortly after their shock 2-0 defeat by Arsenal on Sunday as they look to stay in shape with some warm-weather training.

The likes of Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Frank Lampard were all involved as City prepare for a friendly match against Hamburg on Wednesday afternoon.

Unfortunately for Pellegrini's squad, the weather in Abu Dhabi hasn't been too dissimilar to the colder climes of England.

Speaking of his team's mid-season trip, City forward Stevan Jovetic told Sky Sports: 'It’s nice (to get away) but the weather is the same unfortunately. We were unlucky as today it was raining but it’s nice because all the team is here. A couple of days away from England, it’s nice. 

'We have to prepare good because we have the FA Cup. We need to play well to get through and after that we have a big game against Chelsea - a very important game.'
