Ed Miliband's hopes of a Labour majority will evaporate if Scotland leaves the UK, new analysis reveals today.

Labour is on course to win the 2015 election with a majority of 32 seats in the Commons, according according to a poll - but only because of Scottish MPs who will be given the boot in the event of independence.

Now ministers have been called on to explain how they would respond if Scotland votes for independence, as Britain is faced with a constitutional crisis at the next election.

charge of a 'zombie government' in power thanks to Scottish MPs

How Labour could miss out on a majority if Scotland goes it alone

Without its Scottish MPs, Labour will be three seats 
short of a majority and there will be another hung parliament.

The poll was compiled by John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, for the Independent. He said Scotland could be critical to Labour’s ability to win an overall majority.

In May 2010 Labour won 41 seats in Scotland, the Lib Dems 11, the SNP six while the Conservatives secured just one MP.

If the latest opinion polls are repeated at the general election on May 7, 2015, Labour could win another five seats north of the border.

Currently,
Scottish voters are expected to be able to take part next 
May, meaning Labour could win a majority thanks to its dominance of 
Scottish constituencies. By contrast, the Tories have only one Scottish MP.

But if the country votes for independence, all Scottish MPs would be swept away in March 2016, when Scotland would become an independent nation.

There have been calls for Scottish voters to be excluded from the general election if they decided to vote yes for independence in next week's referendum.

Some MPs have also suggested they will call for legislation to be introduced to postpone the election in the event of a yes vote.

It would be the first time since 1940, a year into the second world war, that a general election would have been postponed.

The option has not yet been discussed with ministers, Whitehall sources say, but
 one official told the paper: 'It is too sensitive before the 
referendum, but we couldn’t duck it any longer if there were a Yes 
vote.'

Former
 Labour MP Eric Joyce, now an independent, said the election would 
‘surely be cancelled’, adding: ‘An English parliamentary election would 
be an entirely new proposition for voters south of the new border.

‘There
 could meanwhile be no question that, for example, Labour might win a UK
 election by a small majority, only to see a Tory government and prime 
minister take power in England without an election once the Scots had 
departed.

'Moreover,
 the notion of Scottish MPs voting on England-only matters while the 
whole parliament was consumed by Scots extracting themselves from the 
union would be nonsensical and unmanageable.’

Angus
 Robertson, SNP leader at Westminster, called last year for a delay in 
the election to allow the negotiations on separation to take place.

David
 Cameron and Ed Miliband today urged people across Britain to fly the 
Saltire to convince voters in Scotland to reject independence, but 
workers struggled to raise the flag in Downing Street

But
 the House of Lords constitution select committee raised doubts about a 
delay, saying: ‘The extension of a parliament beyond five years ... may 
risk being seen by voters as self-serving, extending the time in power 
of the current government.’ 

It comes as David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg will travel to Scotland today to plead with voters to stay in the United Kingdom.

The
 three Westminster party leaders released a joint statement  declaring 
that it was time to go to Scotland to bolster the faltering 'No' 
campaign and ordered the Scottish flag to be raised over Downing Street.

The
 desperate last-ditch move to convince voters to reject independence 
comes amid alarming polls showing a surge in support for independence.
