The five-star hotel owned Andy Murray has failed a food hygiene inspection.

Chez Roux, the restaurant at the luxury £1.8m Cromlix Hotel, was inspected in July by the Food Standards Agency at Stirling Council and issued with an ‘improvement required’ rating.

The FSA said the classification means that the restaurant, which is run by renowned chef Albert Roux, ‘has not achieved an acceptable level of compliance with requirements of food hygiene law’. 

The Wimbledon champion bought the property, three miles from his home town of Dunblane, in February 2013

The Cromlix House hotel was named Scotland's Hotel of the Year just 27 days after it opened in April

Bosses at the hotel, near Kinbuck, Perthshire, have insisted the there was only a minor issue caused by a faulty sink, which has now been fixed. 

The hotel said they have since applied for a second inspection by the FSA in order to have the FSA's review amended. 

Graeme Green, the hotel's general manager, said: ‘The first inspection identified a minor fault with the connection of the hand-wash sink.

'We repaired this immediately and have been informed a pass certificate is being processed.'

They added that the hotel's restaurant has not been closed during the FSA's investigation. 

Judges described Cromlix House as a 'national treasure' at the Scottish Hotel Awards earlier this year

An FSA spokesman said: ‘The scheme effectively opens the door to the kitchen and/or food areas and consumers can see how well food businesses in their area have performed at their last food hygiene inspection. 

'This will increase consumer confidence and help people make informed choices about where they eat.’ 

Albert Roux, who also owns La Gavroche in London - the first British restaurant to win three Michelin stars - oversees the restaurant which is also run by award-winning head chef Darin Campbell.

The Wimbledon champion bought the property, three miles from his home town of Dunblane, in February last year.

The Victorian mansion was extensively refurbished and reopened on April and includes its own private chapel and loch.

Just weeks after it opened its doors to guests the hotel was named Scottish hotel of the year.

Cromlix took the top prize at the Scottish Hotel Awards during a ceremony in Edinburgh with judges calling it a 'national treasure'.

Awards chairman Gary McLean-Quin said at the time: 'This superbly balanced combination of solid investment, vision and hugely experienced management has made Cromlix the unanimous choice of judges this year.

'Hotels often have sizeable sums of money spent on them but that's only half the battle.

Guests can expect to pay up to £595 a night for a room at the Cromlix House hotel during its peak season

'What impressed us - and specifically enabled this award - was the involvement of award-winning management and individuals in every department - people of excellence we have known for a decade. The result is no less than a national treasure.’

The accommodation at Cromlix features 10 bedrooms and five suites, each of which is named after a great Scot, including Robert the Bruce, William Wallace, Robert Burns and even fellow sporting legends Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Chris Hoy.

The hotel overlooks 34-acres of secluded woodland, manicured grounds and tennis courts. Guests can expect to pay up to £595 a night for a room at the hotel during its peak season.

The hotel is being managed for the British number one by Inverlochy Castle Management International and is already fully booked for the Ryder Cup, which is being staged a short drive away at Gleneagles next week.

Several of the suites feature hand-painted freestanding gold, silver and copper baths and the rooms’ 32in televisions screens are disguised as mirrors.
