A star-struck grandmother has revealed how she drives around with a life-sized doll of Sir Cliff Richard in her car - to scare off criminals.

Jill Stolworthy, from Norwich in Norfolk, has been a huge fan of the star - who sang double chart-topper Living Doll - after first seeing him perform 55 years ago when she was just 13.

The 68-year-old and her husband David, 71, drive everywhere with the bizarre dummy belted into the back seat of their Peugeot 206.

Jill Stolworthy and her husband David found the bizarre head dummy at a car boot sale and attached it to  body made of MDF 

The couple snapped up the pop star's head at a car boot sale in 2012 before giving him a body made from MDF with a cushion 'to give him a bit of chest'.

They then used one of Mr Stolworthy's old navy blue blazers, which was destined for the charity shop, and a Norwich City football scarf to dress the doll.

The model also sports a pair of aviator sunglasses - because the Stolworthys say his eyes are too intense to look at.

Mr Stolworthy said: 'We got the head because we like Cliff Richard - Jill especially is a big fan - and it just escalated from there.

'We thought he would be particularly useful when Jill is driving on her own, especially at night, so it looks like there is a male passenger.'

The dummy accompanies the pensioners to the shops and trips to see friends. And, fittingly, he goes on their summer holidays as well.

Mrs Stolworthy has loved Sir Cliff, 73, since she was a girl and has seen him sing all over the UK.

She often plays his music in the car, with his lookalike perched on the back seat and says the doll makes her feel safe when she is on her own.

'Me and my friends are all big Cliff Richard fans. I have got about 22 of his CDs and some DVDs. 

'One of the old 45s we have got in the loft is from when he was in the Drifters,' she said.

'I saw him when he came to the theatre in Norwich in 1959 - I remember queuing up to get tickets and he was just fantastic that night.'

Her husband added: 'We get plenty of people doing double takes when they look into the car.

'But not everyone has picked up on him.

'We recently caught the Dover to Dunkirk ferry service to go to Germany - and not once during the inspection by customs and immigration staff in either country was he spotted or commented on.'

Mrs Stolworthy said the most common reaction from friends and family has been shouts of 'Are you mad?' and 'we are really worried about you two'.

The Norwich City supporters have had plenty of fun with the mocked-up mannequin, scaring friends and family both in the car and around the house.

'We had him in the shed for a while, dressed in a high-visibility jacket and holding a broom - just in case anybody broke in,' said Mr Stolworthy.

The Stolworthys have taken Cliff to friends' houses and on the 1,000 mile round-trip to Germany, where he terrified the German girlfriend of David's cousin.

'We didn't tell her he was in the car and when she got in, she shrieked,' he said.

'What she said in German, I don't know.'

Another friend got a fright when she visited the house and opened the living room door.

'Our cat went up Cliff's blazer, around his head and on to the curtains,' said Mr Stolworthy.

'But it made Cliff's head move and as she came into the living room, it was as if he was lifting his head to look at her.

'She laughed really hard about it afterwards.'
