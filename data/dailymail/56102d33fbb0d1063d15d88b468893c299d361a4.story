A father who allegedly pushed his ex-girlfriend and three-month-old son out of a third-floor window is expected to be charged with murder after the infant died in hospital.

After the pair plunged three levels, Frederico Bruno, of Belleville, New Jersey, reportedly climbed down the fire escape and continued beating them with a table he found in the yard as they lay unconscious on the ground.

He was found hiding in a refrigerator on Friday evening after the brutal attack which left the 20-year-old woman, who has not been identified, in a medically-induced coma.

Damien Bruno, the suspect's baby, 
tragically died from his injuries at Hackensack University Medical 
Center on Tuesday after fighting for his life for four days.

The
19-year-old currently faces 17 counts, including attempted murder and 
child abuse, but he is expected to face upgraded charges after 
investigators receive the results of the baby boy's autopsy.

Bruno was originally charged with two counts of aggravated assault. His bail was also raised from $300,000 to $500,000.

Before his court appearance via video link from jail on Wednesday, Bruno allegedly smeared his face in feces, according to the Jersey Journal.

Fall: Police gather outside the brown apartment block, seen behind, from where the woman and child fell

Bruno reportedly blurted out 'it's a 
lie' as the judge read the complaint against him, according to the 
newspaper, but his public defender quickly cut him off and advised him 
to remain silent.

Police said Bruno let himself in to 
his former girlfriend's Jersey City apartment on Friday morning and hid 
while he waited for her to come home.

When she returned with Damien and a 
friend, he allegedly attacked the woman and turned on her 21-year-old 
friend with a carving knife when she threatened to call 911.

After
slicing the friend to within an inch of her life, he pushed his ex-girlfriend into an air conditioner, causing her and the infant to go through a window and fall three stories.

Bruno then climbed 
down the building's fire escape and, using a table, continued to attack 
the mother of his child, who was lying on the ground on top of her son, police said.

The friend stabbed in the attacked was hospitalized with undisclosed injuries, but has since been released.

The ex-girlfriend had an order of protection against him, authorities said.

According to NBC, Bruno fled to a 
family member's home after the alleged attack and slept for most of the 
day, then told his teenage niece and nephews what had happened when he 
woke up.

Wanted: Police released this Wanted poster but Bruno was later found hiding in a refrigerator. He had also allegedly brutally stabbed his ex-girlfriend's friend

'I know he's always had a bad temper but I never thought he could do this,' Bruno's niece, 17-year-old Ahsley Archelus, told NBC.

'To a baby? How could he do this to his own baby?'

Police cordoned off the area surrounding the four-story building on Rutgers Avenue as they searched for Bruno, whom they described as armed and dangerous.

They eventually found him hiding in a refrigerator in a vacant building near where his siblings live.
