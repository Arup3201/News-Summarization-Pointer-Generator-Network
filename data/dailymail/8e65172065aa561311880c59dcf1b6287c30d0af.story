Babies don't come with an instruction manual, but at least in 2014 there's Google Glass.

The Breastfeeding Support Project in Australia is using the technology to teach new moms how to breastfeed using a hands-free, voice-activated app with on-screen guidance from counselors.

The group partnered with tech company Small World Social to develop the app which recently wrapped up a six-week trial run involving five moms and 15 counselors.

Mommy lessons: The Breastfeeding Project in Australia is using Google Glass to teach new moms to breastfeed using a hands-free, voice-controlled app

Users wearing the glasses are free to 
hold their children as they are guided through step-by-step instructions 
on the breastfeeding process through the voice-activated app.

'Mothers could also securely video call an ABA volunteer counselor who could view the mother's issue through Glass's camera (whether it be latching on, mastitis etc) and give the mother immediate suggestions,' according to a blog post written on the project's website.

The trial wrapped up on April 13 and besides a few technological hiccups, like battery life and connectivity troubles, was mostly successful.

Doing good: The app helped new mom Sarah Bailey (pictured) breastfeed her son Patrick, who was having troubled due to an under-sized jaw

New mom Sarah Jane Bailey was having trouble feeding her son Patrick, since he was born with an undersized-jaw, but her coach helped her with.

'For some users, especially those in remote locations or without a support network close by, it may be their only access to maternal health advice,' another trial participant told the Sydney Morning Herald. 

For now, the $1,500 price tag on a pair of Google Glasses will restrict the app'd user-ship to only wealthy families - but Small World Social is addressing that.

A company spokesman told Inquisitr that they are looking into ways to set up a free or low-cost loan scheme for women so that they may be able to use the app.
