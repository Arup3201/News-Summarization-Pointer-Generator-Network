Accused: David 'Scott' Lemley allegedly had sex with a severely mentally handicapped woman on several occasions

A Baptist pastor has been arrested for allegedly raping a disabled woman who has a mental age of a seven-year-old at her father's request.

David 'Scott' Lemley, 43, is accused of raping the woman, 20, on several occasions because his wife was bedridden with a debilitating illness, according to arrest documents.

The alleged victim's father is said to have offered up his daughter to the pastor, of New Harmony Baptist Church, Baton Rouge.

She reported the attacks to police who
 arrested her father in November.

He remains in East Baton Rouge Parish 
Prison on a variety of sexual offenses.

But detectives on Saturday also detained Lemley on one count of aggravated rape.

He is being held in Parish Prison in lieu of $75,000 bail.

The victim could not provide investigators with exact dates of the alleged rapes.

Lemley, who denies the charges was first questioned about the claims late last year, insisting that the alleged victim 'is known for making up stories for no reason,' a detective wrote in the warrant, according to The Advocate news website.

Documents also say that Lemley failed to turn up for an arranged lie-detector test on December 6, last year.

Lemley
 was also booked on a count of theft of a motor vehicle on Saturday.

He is accused 
of giving away a car, that he was meant to be repairing for someone, to a member of his church.

Claims: David 'Scott' Lemley, 43, who was arrested for aggravated rape, is a pastor at New Harmony Baptist Church, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, pictured

The car was then sold for about $250 in early February for scrap, arrest documents 
show.

Lemley's wife has defended him against what she claimed are 'false charges'.

Kim Lemley said her husband was advised by the coupleâ€™s attorney, Carson Marcantel, not to attend the polygraph test.

Mrs Lemley, who also works at the church, also said the car theft accusations against her husband were false.

She added that she had resolved the dispute with the person who made the complaint.

Mrs Lemley said the couple has worked at the church for several years and that church services for Sunday morning were scheduled as usual.

'Our church is taking care of itself,' she said.
