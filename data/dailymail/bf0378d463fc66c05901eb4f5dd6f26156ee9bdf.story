Injured: Sir Ranulph Fiennes shows his bandaged hand as he speaks to the media during a press conference at Heathrow Airport

He famously chopped off the tips of his fingers with a fretsaw after suffering frostbite during a solo walk to the North Pole.

And today, Sir Ranulph Fiennes revealed that he may lose two more fingers after being forced to pull out of the first ever trek of the Antarctic during winter.

The 68-year-old was injured in a fall 
while skiing during training at a base camp in Antarctica ahead of the Coldest Journey expedition which has been five years in the planning.

He then developed 
frostbite after taking off his outer gloves to fix a ski binding in 
temperatures of around minus 33C (minus 27.4F) - possibly costing him two more of his fingers.

Speaking at a press conference at Heathrow Airport today, he said: 'On this occasion with me I was trying to fix the ski binding in a total white-out.

'I tried fixing the bindings with my big overgloves on - couldn't do a damn thing. You couldn't peel a banana with them on.

'Some people would say surely you shouldn't take your mitts off. OK, so you sit there and go nowhere and die of cold.

'You've got to fix your bindings in order to go back. It's one of those things.

'I had to take everything off to get a grip on the bindings.

'It was no more than 20 minutes before I noticed one of my hands had gone completely white.

'The
vascular surgeon I saw yesterday said that, in his opinion - he wasn't 
sure - two of the fingers definitely would not require surgery and two 
of the fingers might require surgery, to be shorter.'

The explorer said the surgeon who treated his fingers in Cape Town suggested that diabetes may be responsible for causing the frostbite.

Sir Ranulph, who was described as 'the world's greatest living explorer' by Guinness
World Records in 1984, continued: 'Two and a half months ago, my normal GP took a blood sample and said I might be on the verge of type two diabetes.'

Frostbite: Sir Ranulph Fiennes may lose two more fingers when his left hand is operated on by surgeons

Health concerns: Sir Ranulph Fiennes said type two diabetes may have made him more susceptible to the frostbite which could result in the loss of two more of his fingers

He said the diabetes may be responsible for making him more 'susceptible to circulation changes’ and the cold.

Asked
how he was coping with the pain, Sir Ranulph replied: 'I'm on pills, 
lots of pills at the moment and they're working very well at the 
moment.'

Fiennes lost the tips of his fingers on his left hand after he attempted to walk solo and 
unsupported to the North Pole in 2000.

His sleds fell
through weak ice and Fiennes was forced to pull them out by hand. He 
sustained severe frostbite to the tips of all the fingers on his left 
hand, forcing him to abandon the attempt. 

On returning home, his surgeon
insisted the necrotic fingertips be retained for several months before 
amputation, to allow regrowth of the remaining healthy tissue.

Frustrated: Ranulph Feinnes' injuries forced him to pull out of the first winter crossing of the world's coldest continent

But, impatient
at the pain the dying fingertips caused, Fiennes cut them off himself 
with a fretsaw, just above where the blood and the soreness 
were.

Sir Ranulph today admitted he was 'frustrated' he had to quit this latest expedition but said he will continue to support the project through fundraising.

Describing how he felt at having to pull
out, he said: 'It is extremely frustrating. I started working on 
this expedition five years ago.

'I've
been working on it and nothing else full time and unpaid for five years
so it is definitely frustrating but unavoidable and I will make the 
best of it by putting my focus full time on to making my focus entirely 
on the expedition team.'

His team-mates will continue with the 2,000-mile (3,219km) trek, which they are expected to embark on later this month.

Hailed as the last great polar challenge, the journey across the Antarctic has never been attempted during the winter.

The
team will experience some of the toughest conditions on earth - near 
permanent darkness and temperatures as low as minus 90C (minus 130F) 
during their six-month journey.

Sir Ranulph went on: 'You could not put a better team together than that lot.

'I'm very pleased with and proud of the team in charge of the crossing.

'Everything is going totally on schedule as of today.'

The coldest journey team was dropped off by ship on the Pacific coast of the continent 
where they set off over the ice shelf.

The aim was to ascend 10,000ft (3,000m) on to the inland plateau, and
head onwards to the South Pole.

Record-breaking: Fiennes has broken several records and led many expeditions to remote regions. He was described by Guinness World Records in 1984 as 'the world's greatest living explorer'

After covering around 2,000 miles (3,200km) their journey was due to end at the Ross Sea.

Joanna Lumley, a trustee with the Tawt Trust which is behind the expedition, spoke enthusiastically about the trek.

'I can't emphasise enough that in our
strange, dull, bleak, boring, flattened-out, money-grabbing world, this
is the most extraordinary adventure,' she said.

'Thrilling, mad, madcap, daring, is it his last? All those wonderful things. Will his arm drop off? Can the boys do it?

'It is utterly thrilling.'

Fiennes hoped to raise £6.17 million for Seeing Is Believing, a charitable
initiative to tackle avoidable blindness around the world.

Speaking at the press conference today, he said: 'I will focus now 100 per cent
on making sure that the expedition has every possible encouragement, 
has every chance of making maximum money for our charity.

'The expedition will take six months, during which three million people will go avoidably blind.'

Making it alive across one of the most inhospitable terrains in the world was always going to be a huge challenge.

One
hundred years ago on the same ice shelf, Capt Scott died on his polar 
expedition as he was caught out by the start of the southern winter.

If anyone was up to the job, it was Fiennes. He has spent 40 years achieving extraordinary feats which pushed him to the very ends of his endurance.

He is famous for taking part in the 
first successful circumnavigation via both the geographical poles, 
completed with Charles Burton in 1982.

Fiennes also achieved a world first 
in 1992-1993 by completing the first unsupported crossing of the 
Antarctic Continent with Mike Stroud in what was the longest unsupported
polar journey in history.

Sir Ranulph had a double heart bypass
in 2003 and suffered a heart attack two years later as he came 
agonisingly close to the summit of Everest.

He finally reached the top in 2009 on his third attempt, becoming the oldest Briton to do so at 65 years of age.

Ranulph Fiennes' latest injury is the second time he has suffered severe frost bite.

In
2000, the explorer cut part of his own fingers off with a fretsaw after
his left hand was badly damaged by the condition - caused by exposure 
to freezing temperatures.

He
was attempting to walk solo and unsupported to the North Pole when his 
sledge carrying all his food and communication equipment slipped into 
the sea.

After freeing
the sledge his wet hands were exposed to temperatures as low as -63C 
causing the tissue on the tops of his fingers to die.

In his autobiography, Fiennes wrote: 'My fingers were ramrod stiff and ivory white.

'They might as well have been wood... I 
had seen enough frost bite in others to realise I was in serious trouble.
I had to turn back.'

He 
was told he needed to wait up to five months to give the healthy tissue a
chance to grow, but instead Fiennes bought the saw and spent five days 
removing the tips of his damaged fingers and thumb.

It was not the first or last time the adventurer has had to abandon challenges because of injury or illness.

Fiennes
also had to be rescued during an attempt in 1996 to walk to the South 
Pole solo when he suffered a kidney stone attack. 

The explorer also had to abandon an ascent of Mount Everest in 2005 when he was 1,0000ft from the summit after he suffered chest pain. 

He told The Guardian afterwards that 'it felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest.'

Four years later he became the first person ever to reach the summit of Everest and cross both polar ice caps.

The explorer suffered a heart attack in 2003 and underwent a double heart bypass operation.

However, he managed to complete seven marathons in seven days on seven continents just four months later.
