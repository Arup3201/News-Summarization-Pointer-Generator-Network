Mike Phelan is set to make an swift return to coaching by joining Hull City as number two to manager Steve Bruce.

The former Manchester United assistant manager quit his coaching role at Carrow Road in the wake of Alex Neil’s shock appointment as Norwich boss.

It looks like being a brief spell away from the game for Sir Alex Ferguson’s one-time deputy at Old Trafford, though, following claims on Humberside that he is set to join Hull’s coaching staff as assistant to Bruce.

Phelen is set to join Premier League side Hull's coaching staff as Steve Bruce's number two 

Ex-United centre-back Bruce has seen Hull slip into relegation trouble in recent weeks and is thought to view the vastly-experienced Phelan’s arrival as a move that will provide fresh impetus for his struggling side.

Hull have only managed four Premier League wins all season and are currently on a run of three straight defeats without scoring.

Phelan spent five years as assistant manager at United but left the club after Ferguson's retirement in 2013 following the appointment of David Moyes.

The former defender joined Norwich, for whom he played between 1985 and 1989, as first team coach in November last year but, after a short spell as caretaker manager following the resignation of Neil Adams, but left his role after Neil took charge.
