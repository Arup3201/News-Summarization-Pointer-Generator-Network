A cruel uncle is being investigated by police after punishing his six-year-old nephew's bad behaviour by hanging him on a fence post.

Nicu Borila, 30, is the carer for Anima Stoica with the pair living in a house with 20 other family members on the outskirts of the Romanian capital Bucharest.

Borila was asked to look after the boy after the youngster's father was jailed in Spain and his mother went to work in Italy.

Six-year-old Anima Stoica who was hung from a fence by his uncle Nicu Borila as a punishment for running away from home 

Borila has been looking after the little boy as his father is in prison and his mother had to go to Italy to find work 

However, police launched an investigation into his care after disturbing pictures began circulating online of the boy crying as he was hung from the fence by his shirt.

The images were published after they were sent to an anti-child abuse group calling itself The Bracelet of Death.

Meanwhile neighbours have spoken of how they often saw Borila hanging him from the fence.

Dan Vitila, 56, said: 'He treats that boy like an animal.

Borila, right, has tried to defend his actions by saying that he was trying to teach his nephew a lesson and keep him safe from passing traffic 

'When his mother left he was very upset but whenever he cries this uncle grabs him by the neck and hangs him on the fence like an animal at an abbatoir.'

However, when Borila was confronted by neighbours, he said: 'Yeah, and so what?

'It's my fence and he's my nephew. I'm just playing with him.

The pictures first came to light on Facebook after they were published by anti-child abuse charity Th Bracelet of Death 

'Many times he has tried to run away and I have to teach him a lesson.

'There are lots of cars around here and he could get knocked over.'

Confirming they are investigating, a police spokesman said: 'We have seen these pictures and the allegations and are looking into the matter.'
