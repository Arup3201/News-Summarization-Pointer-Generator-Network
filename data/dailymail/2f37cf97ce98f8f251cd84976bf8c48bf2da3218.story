They might be famous for their sun-kissed skin but  where fake tan is concerned, Essex girls are mere amateurs, according to a new report.

Geordies take the top spot as Britain's biggest bronzers as it was revealed that Newcastle sells the most tanning products in the UK.

The research comes from Debenhams which conducted a study to uncover the nation's make-up habits.

Essex girls may love their year-round colour but sales of fake tan are 13 per cent higher than the national average in Tyneside.

Reality star Vicky Pattison from Geordie Shore has even released her own line of faux glow, VIP Tan with shades including Golden Goddess, Bronze Babe and Tropical Tan.

In fact, Essex  failed to secure the place of runner-up as Manchester's sales of 8 per cent above average clinched second place for the city, just marginally ahead of Liverpool (7 per cent).

However, foundation  is the true beauty staple for northern women, accounting for a third of all cosmetics spend in Newcastle, Manchester and Liverpool.

Eye make-up is the biggest seller in Leeds and Sheffield, with  eyeliner  top of the sales charts there, at 6 per cent above the average.

Yet mascara, eye lash curlers and eye shadow are more popular in Birmingham than anywhere else (8 per cent above average sales).

The Only Way Is Essex stars such as Amy Childs, Lauren Pope and Sam Faiers have been credited with boosting sales of false eyelashes in their county.

More fake lashes are sold in Essex than anywhere else in the UK, with sales 11 per cent higher than the average.

Meanwhile, TOWIE hunks including Mark Wright and Joey Essex are thought to be behind the increased demand for male grooming products.

Sales of hair care, moisturiser and facial scrubs for men are 14 per cent higher here than the average across the country.

Yet in London, staying young takes priority. Sales of anti-ageing products, like wrinkle-busting serums, are 9 per cent above average.

Perfume is also most popular in the Capital, accounting for a 4 per cent higher spend here than in other areas.

In Scotland, shoppers splash out the most on dry skin products such as hand cream and lip balm (3 per cent above average).

Wales's cities Cardiff and Newport show strong demand for lipstick (6 per cent above average), just ahead of the Midlands cities of Nottingham, Leicester and Derby (sales 5 per cent above average).

In Bristol, sales of nail varnish are up 13 per cent on other areas but apart from blusher, make-up sales are below average. 

Debenhams' health and beauty director, Sara Stern, says that beauty sales will soar even further in the run-up to Christmas. 

She said: 'We generally always see a peak in make-up, fragrance and skincare sales before Christmas and it's fascinating to see how buying habits differ across the country.

'At this time of year there is more emphasis on metallics and glitter for the eyes and cheek bones and pearlescent lipsticks and glosses as women definitely like to add some sparkle to their festive party look.'

Sara added that the results of the study had come as quite a surprise and adds that reality TV shows such as The Only Way Is Essex had definitely aided the change in beauty habits.

'There are also some clear regional trends, as well as a few surprises, such as Newcastle topping Liverpool and Essex for all things bronzed. 

'The size of sales of male grooming products in Essex immediately brought to mind Joey Essex and Mark Wright who are famous for their immaculate hair, using moisturiser and having facials.

'But in recent years many men across the country have become far more knowledgeable about the benefits of skin and hair products and are open about buying and using them.'
