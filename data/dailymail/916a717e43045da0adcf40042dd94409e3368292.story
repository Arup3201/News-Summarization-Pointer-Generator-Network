Catherine Mayer claims she met Prince Charles and spoke to his closest aids for her new book

The office of Prince Charles has distanced itself from claims that a controversial new book was written with its co-operation.

American Catherine Mayer says she met the Prince and spoke to his closest aides while researching Charles: The Heart Of A King.

A journalist with Time magazine, Ms Mayer paints a picture of Clarence House torn apart by turf wars and describes the future King grappling with insecurities and struggling to control his courtiers and their infighting.

But Kristina Kyriacou, Prince Charles's head of communications, said yesterday that the publishers had overplayed suggestions of official co-operation. She told The Mail on Sunday: 'It is not an official book. The author did not have the access as claimed. Clarence House has no further comment.'

Royal sources said Ms Mayer did attend a dinner with the Prince, but was one of 75 guests and had no access to the top table.

Like other journalists, she joined the Royal rota to cover Prince Charles at work. To suggest there was intimate access is overblown.

Ms Mayer's biography is one of three forthcoming books claiming to offer new detail about Charles, including one by American Sally Bedell Smith, who has written biographies on the Queen and Princess Diana. One source said there seemed to be a 'race' between the two women to publish first.

'Perhaps that is why Catherine Mayer is claiming to have had more access than she did. Both books are unofficial,' he said.

Tony Blair's former spin-doctor Alastair Campbell is also bringing out a book which claims to have new information about Charles.

Publishers say Ms Mayer's book reveals 'a man in sight of happiness yet still driven by anguish' with 'views that mean he will never be as impartial as his mother'.

Ms Mayer's book – extracts of which were published on Kindle and in The Times yesterday – suggests Clarence House is riddled with 'glaring systemic weaknesses'.

She also writes that any criticism of the Prince, who is known to courtiers as 'the Boss', can send him spiralling into 'despair', while turf battles between Charles's staff 'are common and bloody'.

'One former householder refers to Clarence House as Wolf Hall,' she says. According to Ms Mayer, much difficulty is caused by Charles's inability to create clear roles for his staff. He is accused of causing turf wars by failing to set courtiers clear boundaries.

But close sources dismiss these claims. 'Anyone who visits Clarence House always say what a happy ship it is. The staff don't recognise Mayer's claims.

'It is convenient, isn't it, that the television adaptation of Wolf Hall is doing well now as the book comes out.'

Distance: Charles with PR Chief Kristina Kyriacou, who says new book by Catherine Mayer, left, is not official

Despite his current PR headaches, Charles is continuing to trust press team leader Kristina Kyriacou with nurturing his public image.

Kyriacou, 48, has recently signed a new contract and a source said: 'The Prince is delighted. She is the bedrock of his communications team.'
