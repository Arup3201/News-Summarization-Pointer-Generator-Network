Heroes who fought in Afghanistan are engaged in a fresh battle – to raise thousands of pounds for soldiers who have been killed or wounded.

Crack personnel from the Parachute Regiment will be guests of honour at a Festival of Remembrance staged before Armistice Day.

The event has been organised by the Afghanistan Trust, a charity set up to raise money to support Paras who were seriously injured on the Helmand battlefield and the families of those killed on operations in the warzone.

Assistance: Among those helped by the charity are the family of Corporal Bryan Budd, 29, who died in a hail of bullets as he single-handedly stormed a Taliban position near the town of Sangin to save his comrades

Marching on: The Paras, who wear distinctive maroon berets, have a reputation for being among the toughest fighters in the Army

Among those helped by the charity are the family of Corporal Bryan Budd, 29, of 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment.

He received a posthumous Victoria Cross - Britain's highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy - for 'astonishing bravery' in August 2006.

The father-of-two died in a hail of bullets as he single-handedly stormed a Taliban position near the town of Sangin to save his comrades. At least 28 other Paras have died fighting in Afghanistan.

The Festival of Remembrance - called 'A Night To Remember' - will take place at St Dunstan In The West church on Fleet Street in Central London, on November 6.

In attendance: Actor and comedian Bernard Cribbins (pictured with his OBE at Windsor Castle in November 2011), a member of the Paras during his National Service, will be among the special guests

Idea: The Afghanistan Trust was set up in 2007 by Colonel Stuart Tootal. He is pictured second left, with other men who have been to Afghanistan and ran the London Marathon for wounded paratroopers in April

The event will feature music from pipers and buglers, poetry and readings by celebrities and wounded soldiers.

The Paras, who wear distinctive maroon berets, have a reputation for being among the toughest fighters in the Army.

The Afghanistan Trust was set up in 2007 by Colonel Stuart Tootal, who commanded 3 Para during a ferocious tour-of-duty in the insurgents stronghold of Helmand the year before.

His men came under wave after wave of attack from Taliban fighters as they defended 'platoon houses' in barren outposts of the dusty province.

The charity has made donations of thousands of pounds to help with mobility, training and equipment for work, accommodation and transport costs for families to visit wounded loved ones.

Col Tootal, who became a best-selling author after leaving the Army, said: 'The night should strikes exactly the right note of passion, remembrance and celebration whilst also raising money for an extremely worthy cause.'
