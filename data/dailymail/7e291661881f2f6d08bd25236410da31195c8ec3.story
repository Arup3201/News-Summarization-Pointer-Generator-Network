Bundesliga club Cologne has been ordered to pay a heavy fine and close part of its stadium for three home games following crowd disturbances involving its fans.

The German football federation (DFB) says Cologne must pay £143,000 (200,000 euros) and close two standing areas for league games against Hoffenheim, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke.

Cologne has also had its ticket allocation for away games reduced, and all tickets for away games have to be personalized to the end of the season.

The punishment comes after crowd disturbances at Duisberg in the German Cup on October 28, and at the Rhine derby at Borussia Monchengladbach on February 14, when flares were set off and masked Cologne supporters wearing white overalls stormed the pitch, leading to violent scuffles with security staff and police.
