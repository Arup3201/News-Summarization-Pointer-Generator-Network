Binky has always been one of the more modest Chelsea girls, with the reality star often favouring slouchy sweaters and skinny jeans as her clothing of choice.

However, since her  weight loss earlier this summer, the 24-year-old has been far more eager to show off her more slender physique.

And in her latest shoot, for her very own 2015 calendar, we see the Made in Chelsea at her sexiest yet.

Binky Felstead has posed in her sexiest shoot yet for her 2015 calendar 

Binky's confidence has rocketed since slimming down and she says that although these are some of her more risque shots she is thrilled with the images.

'They are the most sensual pictures I have ever shot,' she says of the calendar, which can be ordered at Signature Calendars.

'There are just some days when everything comes together and you can honestly say to yourself: "I feel good." Well, this was one of those days.' 

Binky admits that she struggled with fashion in her teens and was considered a 'complete geek' as she struggled to find the right look.  

'There have been some proper cringey disasters along the way. I was a complete geek who wore big round glasses for a long time.' 

Since losing weight Binky claims she has felt more confident in herself and more comfortable showing off her figure

The reality star says that she is thrilled with the images and she came away from the shoot feeling fabulous

Binky admits that she used to make a lot of style mistakes when she was younger but says her taste in fashion is now more grown up

Despite having taken more of an interest in fashion lately Binky insists that you don't need to have a Chelsea budget to look good. 

'My mum always says you look good in a bin bag when you're young and you don't need to waste money on expensive designer gear, which is true. I mainly go for the usual high street shops.'

Binky who wears lingerie brand Bluebella exclusively throughout the shoot, says:'Bluebella looks sensational in the bedroom, but I wear it all the time - not just on date nights.

'It makes you feel great if you are out with someone special or slogging through a 14-hour shoot with Made In Chelsea.'

Binky admitted that her latest calender looks aren't something she'll be recreating every day

But Binky admits that her latest calender looks aren't something she'll be recreating every day: 'The idea is to show a slightly different side to Binky - one in which I am very happy about my sexuality and body confidence.'

Bluebella founder Emily Bendell, 32, says she loves working with Binky and the fact that she provides a more demure look.

'We love the quiet confidence Binky exudes in our new collection. We've all been rooting for her in the last year in Made In Chelsea and it is wonderful to see her back to her best in this sensual shoot.'
