Wilfried Bony is committed to the Swansea cause and despite being linked to a number of clubs throughout Europe wasn't pushing for a move away during the summer, says manager Garry Monk.

A wide range of clubs, including Liverpool, Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga and Lekhwiya in Qatar, were reported to want the Ivorian's signature after his impressive debut season in South Wales. 

But Monk tells the South Wales Evening Post that his imposing front man, who found the net 25 time in all competitions, is showing the dedication at training and in matches of a player who genuinely wants to be there.

'Wilf commits very well, he is focused on what we want to do,' he says. 

'If he was coming in and wandering about disillusioned, we would have a problem.

'But he does not do that, he comes in, commits and is at one with the group. That is all I can ask for.' 

While Bony went nowhere in the summer, Monk brought in Bafetimbi Gomis from Lyon on a free transfer.

Monk has stressed Frenchman Gomis was brought in as competition and not a replacement for Bony, who signed in July last year from Dutch club Vitesse.

The manager has also said he's not concerned at Bony's lack of goals so far this campaign while his side remains undefeated and separated from Chelsea at the top of the Premier League only by goal difference.
