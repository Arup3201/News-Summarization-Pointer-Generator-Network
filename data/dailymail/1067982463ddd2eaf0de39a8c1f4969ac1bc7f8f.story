David Cameron has pledged to confront Vladimir Putin over Russia's 'illegal' actions in Ukraine at the G20 this weekend.

The Prime Minister said he would use the summit in Brisbane, Australia, to tell the President that Britain does not want another Cold War.

But he also warned that Moscow's relationship with the rest of the world will be 'radically different' if it does not change course.

The comments came as Mr Cameron delivered an impassioned defence of the UK's role on the international stage at the Lord Mayor's Banquet in London.

He said: 'Russia's illegal actions are destabilising a sovereign state and violating its territorial integrity.

'They are ripping up the international rulebook, and disregarding the democratic will of the Ukrainian people to determine their own future.

'This weekend has seen further shelling, and reports of more heavy weapons moving from Russia into South East Ukraine.

'Again there will be those who say that this isn't our business and that we shouldn't interfere.

'And some will argue that we can't - that we have no influence to bear.

'But I believe both views are wrong. I don't believe there is a military solution. But that is not the only tool available to us.

'Economic sanctions on Russia are having an impact.

'Capital has flown out of Russia, banks are short of finance, and the Russian stock market and Rouble have fallen significantly.'

The Prime Minister delivered his foreign policy speech at the annual banquet, which was held at London's Guildhall this evening

Mr Cameron referred to a warning from former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev that Moscow and the West were on the brink of a 'new Cold War'.

'That is not an outcome we believe to be inevitable - and neither is it one we seek,' he added.

'And I will make that clear to President Putin in Brisbane this weekend.

'But I will also be clear that if Russia continues on its current path, then we will keep upping the pressure, and Russia's relationship with the rest of the world will be radically different in the future.'

Addressing the room at London's Guildhall, the Prime Minister cited Ukraine, Ebola and fighting Islamic State (IS) as areas where 'the costs of inaction are far greater' than playing our part.

However, he also stressed that he would never lose sight of Britain's national interests when formulating foreign policy.

'Some have pursued an unquestioning embrace of globalisation in all its aspects and failed to recognise that this could be damaging to our economic security,' he said.

'On immigration they have advocated its benefits without recognising that it is also has to be controlled.

'The same is true of our membership of the European Union. It only works if we have an arrangement that reflects the needs of Britain.

'Engaging in the world can't mean just going along with whatever other people say.'

The annual event, hosted by the Lord Mayor of London Alan Yarrow, was attended by dozens of dignitaries who listened to the speech by the Prime Minister as well as one from the Lord Mayor himself. 

Mr Yarrow was recently elected 687th Lord Mayor of the City of London, a role that has been in existence since 1189.
