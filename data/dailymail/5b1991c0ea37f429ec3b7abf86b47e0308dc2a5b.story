We are constantly told how 'booking online' could save us a tidy amount on our hotels and holidays.

But a new study has shown that other customers may still be getting a better deal - even when the search criteria is identical.

And often it pays to be a member of the website you're buying from.

There are a number of factors to consider when trying to get the best holiday and hotel deals

A study titled 'Measuring Price Discrimination and Steering on E-commerce Web Sites' by Northeastern University in Boston, US, has discovered that online price discrimination exists, and users are often 'price steered' according to recent bookings and browser history.

It may not be news to some, and confirm what a lot of us have long believed to be true, but deals being dependent on what 'device' you're using to make a booking may surprise you. 

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Christo Wilson, who co-wrote the report, said: 'We found several instances of personalization on the travel sites. 

'Cheapticket and Orbitz both give 'Members Only' deals on hotels to users who are logged-in. The discounts pop up on 5 per cent of hotels, and amount to $12/night off on average. Travelocity gives discounts to iPhone users: 5 per cent of hotels were marked down by $15/night on average.

Searching on a mobile in different locations may be a good bet for best prices

'Expedia and Hotels.com steer a small fraction of their users (less than 10 per cent) towards cheaper hotel rooms. These sites appear to be performing pricing experiments on their users using a technique called A/B testing. 

'Users are randomly assigned to groups based on their cookie; two groups are shown average hotel prices of about $187/night, while the third group is shown hotels of about $170/night. 

'There is mounting evidence that e-commerce companies are using personalization algorithms to implement price steering and discrimination.'

The report, that focused on a wide-range of companies, used Cheaptickets, Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline and Travelocity for its travel analysis.

The report has found that hotel and holiday prices can vary dependent on what device you are using to search

The study found that users are placed into different 'buckets' dependent on a number of factors, including browser trends. Cookies that store information about buying trends across the internet can help website tailor a set of results for the user.

Expedia uses this method of steering on its hotel searches, although price discrimination was not found when using this website.

Here are a few tips to help you get the best deal possible on hotel and holiday searches... 

Clear your cookies - websites use trends stored in these to tailor your search to different hotels - and this could be the more expensive ones. Delete your browser history.

Be patient - Adding a selection to your basket doesn't mean you have to purchase immediately. Some retailers will continue to alter prices dependent on popularity and time-span, so it's often worth taking a risk and holding fire.

Use different devices - Some companies will tailor results by what device and platform you are using, so it pays to carry out a few searches using different means.

Location, location, location - If you are always on the move, try conducting a search from different parts of the country, or world. This has been found to influence search results.  

However on Cheaptickets and Orbitz, which are actually one company, the research found that users who were 'logged in' generally received a better deal than visitors.

The report continues; 'First, although members-only prices may be an accepted practice, it still qualiﬁes as price discrimination.'

Travelocity extended the results still further as research revealed prices differed depending on what device you were using to book hotels.

'Travelocity alters hotel search results for users who browse from iOS devices,' it continues.

'Users browsing with Safari on iOS  receives lightly different hotels, and in a much different order than users browsing from Chrome on Android, Safari on OS X or other desktop browsers.'

Priceline alters hotel search results based on the user's history of clicks and purchases although there was no evidence of price discrimination.

This kind of price discrimination is not illegal, demonstrated of when it can prove advantageous for the customer, an example being when you have printed off a money-off voucher for goods. 

There are ways to keep ahead of the game and be in the best position to get the best deals however: search when signed in, then when not, clear the cookies on your browser, and use different devices when conducting a search.

A spokesperson for Expedia said: 'Presenting different booking paths and options to different consumers through our A/B testing allows us to continually innovate to best serve consumers'.
