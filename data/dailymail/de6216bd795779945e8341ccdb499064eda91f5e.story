Law change: Adults would only be able to view porn if they specifically 'opt in'. (Posed by model)

The fight for an automatic block on online porn will begin in earnest today, with a bid to bring in new laws.

A senior peer will launch a bid to change the law obliging Britain’s internet giants to impose a filter to block access to all pornographic images.

The private member’s bill from Baroness Howe - the wife of former Tory Chancellor Geoffrey Howe - would bring in a system whereby adults will only be able to see porn if they specifically ‘opt in’ after a strict age verification check.

But the legislation faces opposition 
from Liberal Democrat peers, who claim that an opt-in system is not the 
best way to protect children online.

Lady Howe, an independent Crossbench 
peer who chaired juvenile courts earlier in her career, said action was 
needed because of the ‘dangerous’ effect that sexual content was having 
on relationships between boys and girls.

She
warned that access to porn was giving children the wrong idea about 
relationships and could lead to teenage boys treating girls as sex 
objects.

Baroness Howe told the Daily Mail that ISPs should take action because porn was such a ‘lucrative’ source of revenue for them.

‘The duty is on those who make extra profit from this sort of material to do all they can to protect under 18s,’ she said.

She
added: ‘The amount of pornographic material which is now available 
through all these new methods on the internet is really quite dangerous 
for young people.

‘A lot of children now are far more savvy about the internet than their parents, so they are much more likely to come across this sort of material by mistake.

‘An opt-in system would rule out any concern people have about their children getting access to adult material by mistake.’

'Dangerous': Baroness Howe said easy access to porn was affecting young people's relationships. (Posed by model)

Her ‘Online Safety Bill’, received its first reading earlier this year but its second reading today is the first chance for debate.

The legislation only has a chance of becoming law if it receives the support of ministers. Only when the Government grants enough Parliamentary time to debate a private members’ bill does it have any hope of passing into law.

Lib Dem sources last night insisted they were keen to protect children online, but were still considering the results of a Government consultation on whether an opt-in system was the best way forward.

The Daily Mail is campaigning for an ‘opt in’ system which would protect children from adult material on the web by restricting it to those over the age of 18 who specifically ask to see it.

But ministers and the internet giants would prefer a less stringent ‘opt out’ scheme under which parents are offered the option of imposing a filter.

In July, a huge petition calling for an opt-in system - containing 115,000 names - was handed in to Downing Street.

And a government consultation on the issue attracted 3,500 responses by the time it finished in September.

But despite the high response, ministers have not yet responded to the consultation or even revealed what the majority view was.

Some campaigners claim the government is dragging its feet on the issue.

Baroness Howe said her bill was an attempt to force ministers to act.

The explanatory notes of the bill state that its objective is to ‘reduce the ability of children and young people to access inappropriate material online’.

Under her plans:

Lady Howe said easy access to porn was affecting young people's relationships.

‘I am concerned about proper loving relationships between boys and girls, and that they have proper respect for one another,’ she said. ‘I am concerned about the harm that this sort of stuff can do.’

Baroness Howe said she hoped ISPs would take action voluntarily - but the bill would force them to impose filters if they do not ‘stir themselves to action’.

‘[Online porn] is quite a lucrative source of income for ISPs, who want to allow people to do what they like over the age of 18,’ she said.

‘If you’re over 18 then of course is your own business, but there are real concerns about the under 18s.‘The duty is on those who make extra profit from this sort of material to do all they can to protect under 18s,' she added.

From knives to films to gambling, there is an age verification process... so why can't there be one for the internet?

By BARONESS HOWE

The internet has opened up a communication and information highway making Skyping our children at university, booking a holiday and finding homework answers all possible within a few keystrokes.

However, with its ascendancy there has also been the more disturbing element of unfettered access to explicit material for internet users.

Young people and children can unwittingly stumble across pornographic material from an innocent Google search or be presented with multiple videos about how-to self-harm whilst viewing YouTube videos.

With only 39 per cent of parents of children aged 5-15 using internet controls or filtering software we can be sure this is a widespread problem.

Accessing the internet from the privacy of your own room as an under-18-year-old can cause unwarranted problems from harmful exposure to age-inappropriate material to cyber-bullying.

When 66 per cent of young people aged 7-16 say that they use their laptops or other portable devices tucked away in their bedroom, the low take-up of filtering software is a significant cause for concern.

Current legislation on online child safety is clearly deeply unsatisfactory.

Children and young people are frequently viewing material which is not appropriate for them. There are no effective legal safeguards in place to protect them.

In 2010, 11 per cent of UK children aged 9-16 had encountered sexual images online in the previous year.

This heightened exposure has been found to impact conceptions of sexual norms, body image and behaviour within relationships amongst young people.

The Government recently consulted with the public on three models of internet safety, one of which mirrored the system I propose in my Online Safety Bill – the opt-in model.

The opt-in model would block pornographic adult content unless the user can demonstrate that they are 18 or over and they opt-in to access the content.

It would also require device manufacturers to provide means of filtering other content (e.g. violence or gambling) at the time of purchase.

By supporting my Bill, the Government could make it law for the industry, including internet service providers, mobile phone operators and device manufacturers, to help parents protect under-18s from exposure to harmful material.

I was extremely concerned that the Government’s consultation did not even mention age verification.

Every school in the country operates a default filter on age-inappropriate content for its pupils so we are in no doubt that the technology is available.

There would be no technical obstacles to performing age verification online at 18.

Mobile phone companies have been operating age verification since 2004 and we see many products and services from knives to films or even gambling restricted by age in our supermarkets, cinemas and on our high streets.

Online gambling has been restricted by a system of age verification since the Gambling Act 2005 and this has proved to be a successful method to protect children and young people who are vulnerable to the risks that come with access to gambling.

My Online Safety Bill therefore seeks to migrate to the online world practices which are commonplace, well understood and accepted in the real world, and have been for years.

The industry has shown itself not willing to take all the necessary steps to provide protection for vulnerable minors off its own back.

Now we need to get tough and force all those who provide internet services to act decisively on this issue.

The law must be changed. We have a responsibility to future generations to do this today.

ISPs and mobile phone operators would be forced to provide an internet service without access to pornography.

Adult subscribers would be able to opt in to receive adult content. They would have their age verified by the service provider.

In addition, the manufacturers of computers and smart phones would also have to provide software at the time of purchase to enable people to filter internet content.

@highlight

The idea behind this additional filtering level is so that parents can choose to exclude material they deem inappropriate for their child at different ages.

@highlight

Mobile phone operators and ISPs would also have to provide prominent, easily accessible and clear information about online safety at the time of purchase - and to make such information available for the duration of the service.
