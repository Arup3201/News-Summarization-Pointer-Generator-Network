A homeowner is preparing to do battle with his residents' association after it fined him $200 for flying the Betsy Ross flag outside his house.

David Renner annoyed neighbours in Littleton, Colorado, when he hoisted the revolutionary-era standard with its 13 stars and stripes outside his townhouse in the run up to Flag Day.

Slapping him with the fine, the Southbridge Townhomes Association told Mr Renner the only acceptable American flag is the current incarnation, which has 50 stars and 13 stripes.

Don't tread on me: David Renner outside his home in Littleton, Colorado, with the Betsy Ross flag still flying in the background despite his having been fined $200 by his homeowners' association

Now Mr Renner is planning to consult an attorney, who he thinks will back up his opinion that the association is acting contrary to the 2005 Freedom to Display the American Flag Act.

It's just the latest volley in a long-running dispute between Mr Renner and his homeowners' association. But he told KWGN reporter Tammy Ross he doesn't really want a fight over his flags.

'I just want to honour our history,' he said.

The American flag has been redesigned 26 times since it was officially adopted on June 14, 1777.

One of its first incarnations, the so-called 'Betsy Ross' flag that got David Renner in trouble with his neighbours, had 13 stars and 13 stripes to represent the 13 colonies in the original Declaration of Independence.

While its origins are not well documented, a popularly accepted legend is that Betsy Ross, the wife of a militiaman, sewed it from a sketch handed to her by George Washington. However at the time the design was by no means universally used, and a number of flags loosely based on the prescribed design were used in the early years of American independence.

Over the years more stars have been gradually added to the American flag to reflect the addition of new states to the union. The current flag has been in use since 1960, when Hawaii was made a state.

In April Mr Renner, a flag enthusiast who
 owns 13 flags, was warned by the HOA for flying the Gadsden, the 
yellow, pre-revolutionary flag which proclaims 'don't tread on me'.

Attempting to mollify neighbours, he took down the Gadsden - a favourite of Tea Party conservatives - and hoisted his Colorado flag instead.

In May, the HOA fined him $100 in response and he took down the flag, replacing it with the Betsy Ross, an early version of the current Star and Stripes that was first adopted in 1777.

It is distinctive for the circular arrangement of its 13 stars - representing the 13 colonies that originally declared independence from the UK.

But in June that drew another fine, this time for $200. This time, however, Mr Renner says he won't back down, despite a letter threating further action from the homeowners' association.

Mr Renner says he is growing disillusioned with the benefits offered by the association. 'What are we gaining? What are we losing?' he asked KWGN.

'Are we losing our freedom for a nice manicured lawn? I really hope we are not.'
