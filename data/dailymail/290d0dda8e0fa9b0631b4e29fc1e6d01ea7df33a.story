A 19-year-old student tried to kill her mother by shooting at her three times in the hopes of inheriting $500,000.

Nicole Boover ambushed Sherri, 51, at the door of her New Orleans apartment after formulating a callous murder plan, police believe.

Boover had earlier bought duct tape, gloves and the 'Scream' masks made famous by the popular horror film, it is claimed.

'Calculated': Nicole Boover, 19, bought duct tape and 'Scream' masks before trying to shoot her mother at the 51-year-old's apartment door

She allegedly enlisted the help of a fellow student from Louisiana State University, 18-year-old Nathan Yuhas, by offering him a $50,000 cut of the cash.

The teenage girl knocked on her mother's door at 4.30am and smiled through the peephole until Mrs Boover opened it, according to nola.com.

When she saw her daughter aiming a silver handgun at her, police said, Mrs Boover slammed the door shut and locked it.

The student then allegedly fired three shots at the door, ran to her car and went back to her dorm room at LSU, leaving the 51-year-old uninjured.

NOPD was alerted and Boover's stepfather then called the LSU Police Department and informed them that his stepdaughter could have returned to her dorm at the university campus in Baton Rouge.

LSU police found her car, with Yuhas inside, before discovering the girl in her dorm - finding 'small amounts' of marijuana in the vehicle and the room.

Yuhas told officers about the supposed murder plot, allegedly claiming that he and Boover intended to leave the state and not cooperate with police if they were stopped.

Yuhas has been charged with serving as a principal to attempted first-degree murder, and Boover with attempted first-degree murder. her bail was set at $500,000.

The girl's father, Richard, was divorced from her mother in 2010.

Mrs Boover is very religious and runs a Catholic ministry at Mount Carmel Academy, where her daughter attended school.

Boover used to run track for Mount Carmel, her friend Monica LaForge told WWL-TV, but later transferred to another high school, before completing her prep studies outside regular school.

Ms LaForge said on Thursday: 'Nicole Boover is an amazing person with many outstanding qualities. Thinking ahead and considering consequences is not one of them.'

A minister visiting the suspect's mother at her apartment on Thursday said Boover 'is a good person'.Reverend Russell added: 'Right now, (the Boover) family is concerned about restoring the family order that has always been there.

'They're good people... We're just trying to get it straightened.'
