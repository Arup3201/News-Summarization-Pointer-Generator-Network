A queue of traffic this bad is normally the result of an accident.

But this jam is caused by something considerably less serious.

The opening of a Krispy Kreme drive-thru doughnut store has led to three days of road chaos, with motorists queuing for up to an hour for the shop.

And traffic police have resorted to urging drivers to avoid the area altogether.

Yesterday, two patrol cars were sent 
to the Hermiston Gait retail park, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, to try
to stop Krispy Kreme customers causing a complete traffic meltdown.

The store opened on Wednesday and has
been inundated with customers, causing problems for other shops on the 
park and transport bosses as the  tailbacks reach the busy city bypass 
and M8.

A Lothian and Borders police 
spokesman said: ‘The traffic is  getting very busy and we are advising 
motorists to avoid that side of town on their journeys.’

The officers at Hermiston Gait did 
manage to mix business with pleasure – receiving a box of doughnuts from
the shop for their hard work.

One policeman was seen enjoying a bite before putting the box in the back of his van.

The store, the first opened in 
Scotland by the American chain, took £60,000 on its first day – three 
times its previous UK record.

Some customers even came from Glasgow to buy the doughnuts, which cost £10.95 for 12 ‘pick your own’.

Not everyone was impressed, however, with one Twitter user posting: 'Edinburgh will be obese within a year'.

The
best-selling doughnuts in the Edinburgh store were the original glazed,
chocolate iced with sprinkles, and chocolate iced creme-filled.

Record-breaking queues: Staff served 400 customers in the first hour the Edinburgh store was open

Krispy
Kreme, which is best known for its sugar-glazed ring doughnut, opened 
its first UK store with a concession in Harrods in 2003.  There are now 
around 35 stores in Scotland, England and Wales.

Health campaigners said they were ‘appalled’ by how long people were prepared to queue for.
Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘If Edinburgh is overweight today then it will certainly be obese by tomorrow.

‘I thought after the deep-fried Mars 
bar that I had seen the worst, but  this is actually unbelievable – that
people would go to such lengths to buy doughnuts.’

Nearly there: Some of those waiting had been lured there by free doughnuts given out to shoppers on Edinburgh's Princes Street
