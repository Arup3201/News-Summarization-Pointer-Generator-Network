Sales of Charles Dickens' novels have soared because of the popularity of television adaptations, booksellers revealed yesterday.

The BBC versions of Great Expectations and the Mystery of Edwin Drood have created a resurgence of interest in the Victorian writer.

It means Dickens could find himself back among the bestsellers' list alongside modern authors JK Rowling, Stig Larsson and Stephen King.

Great Expectations: Popularity of the BBC version, which starred Douglas Booth as Pip, right, and Estella, Vanessa Kirby, has led to increased interest in the books

BBC hit: Great Expectations attracted a quarter of the audience share when it screened on December 27. Here Douglas Booth plays Pip and Gillian Anderson is Miss Havisham

An audience of more than six million watched Great Expectations on the BBC over Christmas.

In the TV adaptation Douglas Booth, 19, starred as teenage Pip, alongside actors Ray Winstone and Gillian Anderson.

It was followed by The Mystery of Edwin Drood which was watched by three million people when the first part of it was screened last week.

Dickens died before the novel was finished so television scriptwriter Gwyneth Hughes wrote her own ending.

Publishers' payday: Royalties don't have to be paid on Charles Dickens' novels because the copyright has expired

Melanie Harris, of Waterstones, said there had been new interest in the Victorian author because of the success of the television shows.

'The feast of Dickens themed TV over Christmas and the New Year has got people talking about Dickens again,' she said.

'A lot of readers watched Great Expectations and realised they have never read the book.Â 

'We have definitely seen a resurgence of interest in Dickens and a number of fabulous new editions of his classic tales are now on the shelves.'

Amazon and WH Smith also say Dickens is back in fashion thanks to the TV adaptation of Great Expectations.

It means a big payday for publishers as there are no royalties to be paid because Dickens died so long ago.

Dickens
is top of the charts for the best-selling single volume of all time 
with A Tale of Two Cities which has sold more than 200 million copies.

Dickens interest: Rosa Bud, played by Tamzin Merchant, and Edwin Drood, played by Freddie Fox, in the BBC version of The Mystery of Edwin Drood. The novel was never finished by Dickens
