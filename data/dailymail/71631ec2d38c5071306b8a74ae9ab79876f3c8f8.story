The parents of a scalded toddler were sent to a specialist burns unit more than 170 miles away without offering an ambulance.

The parents of Corey Duffield, who do not drive, were told to travel from the Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro, to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.

The family said they arrived in Bristol eight hours after a boiling pan fell on the 22-month-old child.

But the hospital said Corey was not showing 'signs of undue pain and distress'.

It added that if the 22-month-old boy’s parents had 'raised any concerns about the difficulty of getting to Bristol we would have organised transport for them'.

Corey’s mother, Donna Thomas, said: 'We got to hospital and they checked him out, called the hospital in Bristol and we were basically told to find our own way.

'We assumed we would have been offered an ambulance.'

Corey’s grandmother had to take him to Frenchay Hospital.

Mother Ms Thomas said: 'We had to put the seat straps over his shoulder which had been burnt, it was a really stressful journey.

'Anything could have happened on that journey - he could have taken a bad turn.'

The Royal Cornwall Hospital said: 'We are very sorry that Corey’s parents are unhappy about their son’s treatment and the arrangement for him to transfer to the burns unit in Bristol.

'Corey’s condition was fully assessed by the emergency department doctor.

'In line with the protocols agreed with the team at Frenchay Hospital, it was considered appropriate for him to travel by car.'

The accident happened on September 17 and his father, James Duffield, said the boy had made a 'spectacular recovery'

Dr Amber Young, from North Bristol NHS Trust, said: 'The South West Children’s Burns Centre based at Frenchay Hospital, is the lead paediatric burn service within the region treating all severities of burn injuries.

'Under protocols agreed, children with significant burns are transferred to Frenchay Hospital for specialist care.

'Decisions on how a patient is transferred to the burns centre - whether by ambulance or by private car - is made by the judgment of the senior emergency team treating the child at the referring hospital.'
