When it comes to beating the buzzer, this is a near-impossible move.

During the Utah Jazz’s Friday night game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Trevor Booker managed to do something that has been called everything from a 'circus shot' to 'the craziest thing of the NBA season'.

With only 0.2 seconds left on the clock, Booker executed an over-the-head slap of the ball with two hands that landed with a swish, in what will undoubtedly become the basket of the year.

Making the move even more incredible is that NBA rules require 0.3 seconds to complete a full catch and shooting motion, so any shot Booker made at the time had to be a tap.

The amazing shot saw Utah take the lead into halftime with 50-44.

However, they ended up losing to Oklahoma 99-94.

However, as Eric Freeman from Yahoo! Sports blogged, Bookers basket 'probably should have counted for another six points'. 

After the game, Booker maintained the shot was no fluke.

'I know you won't believe me but I really do practice those shots,' he said, according to Business Insider. 

'My cousin Jordan Hill (of the Los Angeles Lakers) texted me after the game, he was like ''they probably won't believe it, but we practiced those shots all the time growing up''.'

Another look: Booker maintains he has practiced this exact shot before

Up and over: There wasn't enough time of the clock for him to be allowed to catch and shoot

Boom: The moment has already gone down in NBA history
