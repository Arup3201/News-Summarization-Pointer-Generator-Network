Talk about a rager.

A fraternity that belongs to the University of Michigan have been forced to apologize to a ski resort after running amock last weekend and causing $50,000 worth of damage to the facility while doing so.

The party occurred at the Treetops Resort in Dover Township, near Gaylord, and involved about 120 people spread across 45 rooms.

'I’ve been in this business for 30 years and it’s the worst condition of rooms that I’ve ever seen,' manager Barry Owens told USA Today.

Animal house: The extent of the damage done to to the Dover Township resort was so severe the roof tiles collapsed into the hallways

'There were broken ceiling tiles in the hallway, broken furniture, broken windows. 

'There’s carpet that’s going to need to be replaced.”

'The rooms were just a pigsty.

'They caused an excessive amount of damage.'

The fraternity at fault was named as Sigma Alpha Mu.

Chapter President Joshua Kaplan says his members 'are embarrassed and ashamed of the behavior' of some members. 

Wild: Treetops Resort say many rooms were completely trashed, with the damage about $50,000

Smashed: The scene looked like someone had taken to many rooms with a hammer, with debris everywhere

Trouble: The resort is considering its options, including pursuing criminal charges against the fraternity

Resort staff said they asked the students to stop, but they didn't, and the extent of the damage is apalling

He told USA Today that his fraternity 'accepts full responsibility' and 'will be working with the management of the resort to pay for all damages and cleaning costs'.

'This behavior is inconsistent with the values, policies, and practices of this organization,' Kaplan said.

'We will work within our own organization and with university officials to hold those who are responsible accountable for their actions.'

University of Michigan fees are about $29,000 a year.

Mr Owens said he has a meeting set up with University officials to discuss what happened at his resort, and pending the outcome of that meeting might pursue criminal action.

He added that he has been able to keep place up-an-running, with other, untarnished rooms available because of the size of the resort.

Scene: The fraternity at fault was named as Sigma Alpha Mu

UM Spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said in a statement to USA Today that the university “is very disappointed in the behavior of some of our students' and that those responsible will be held accountable.

'We expect full payment for all damages,' Fitzgerald.

'The local Greek chapters are in the process of notifying their national organizations, which could bring their own sanctions. 

'We are confident the national organizations will take this seriously and will work through this situation in collaboration with the university.'

The college: The cost of attending the University of Michigan is about $29,000 a year
