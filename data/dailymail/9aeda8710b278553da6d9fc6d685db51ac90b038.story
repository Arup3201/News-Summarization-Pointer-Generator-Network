Arsene Wenger has admitted that the club are still some way off bringing in any new recruits, despite the transfer window being set to slam shut in under two weeks.

Arsenal have been linked with a move for Olympiacos defender Kostas Manolas following the departure of centre-back Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona, but Wenger has told the official club website that any potential deal is still some way off.

'Honestly, we are not close to signing anybody,' said Wenger, when questioned upon the subject of defensive recruitment after their goalless draw with Besiktas in the first leg of their Champions League play-off on Tuesday night. 'I have nothing special to add on that at the moment.'

Following the summer departures of Vermaelen and Bacary Sagna, who left for Manchester City on a free transfer, the Gunners have added right-back Mathieu Debuchy and youngster Calum Chambers to their defensive department.

And despite both impressing during their brief spells at the club so far, Gunners fans will be hoping that more strength will be added in an area of the pitch where they looked desperately stretched at times last season.

'We are a bit short at the back, yes you're right. But we should have [Per] Mertesacker and [Mesut] Ozil and [Lukas] Podolski available again at the weekend. Let's hope they are in good shape when we go home.'
