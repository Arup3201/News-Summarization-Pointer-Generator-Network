A Long Island yeshiva student has been arrested for scrawling anti-Semitic graffiti on local train stations.

Jonathan Schuster, 18, of Far Rockaway, faces eight felonies and more than a dozen other criminal charges for writing slurs over advertisements at the Cedarhurst Long Island Railroad station over the past year, cops said.

Police accuse Schuster of writing slurs on eight separate occasions at the Nassau County commuter rail station since December 2012, Mineola Patch reported.

The misguided teen used black marker to scribble the hateful missives, said authorities.

The yeshiva Priority 1:Torah Academy senior made all of his remarks against Orthodox Jews, police said.

The majority of his accused tagging took place during overnight hours, according to Newsday.

It is not known if his discriminatory tagging is also related to swastikas drawn at the Lawrence and Hewlett stations, according to NBC New York.

Hateful: All of the graffiti targeted Orthodox Jews

Schuster was captured by transit police 
after an extensive uniformed and plain clothes investigation that 
included a reward led to multiple tips to Nassau County Police.

'Iâ€™m proud of the successful joint efforts between the Nassau County Police Department and MTA to apprehend the person responsible for the many anti-Semitic crimes,â€™ said County Executive Ed Mangano.

The teen is charged with eight felony counts of criminal mischief as a hate crime, and eight misdemeanor counts each of criminal mischief and making graffiti.

The investigation into the racist graffiti at the other two nearby stations remains ongoing.
