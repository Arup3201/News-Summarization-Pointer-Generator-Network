Thrill-seekers are being given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to scale the 500ft South Tower on the Forth Road Bridge, to celebrate its 50th anniversary.

People can pay £120 to use the maintenance lift on the bridge which spans the Firth and Forth Estuary in East Scotland.

The suspension bridge which was at one point the second largest in the world connects Edinburgh and Fife by road.

Groups of 12 will take a cramped lift 490 feet up and then climb the final ten feet to the top using just a ladder and ropes.

In total, the structure is over 1.5 miles long. It is made from 39,000 
tonnes of steel and 4,414,333 cubic feet of concrete. The bridge's two 
cables are constructed from 30,000 miles of steel wire

The Forth Road Bridge was officially opened by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh with a 21-gun salute in 1964, and at that time was the longest bridge in the world outside America.

In total, the structure is over 1.5 miles long. It is made from 39,000 tonnes of steel and 4,414,333 cubic feet of concrete. The bridge’s two cables are constructed from 30,000 miles of steel wire.

The bridge is very flexible and even if the wind were to blow at 110 miles per hour, 
the centre point of the bridge would only move around 23 feet in the direction
of the wind.

Visitors scaling the top ladder will do so in single file, handing down a hook to the person below which will secure them to the structure.

Both the lift and the ladder are in place so that maintenance workers can carry out repairs to the bridge, but has most recently been used for the filming of the BBC's Hairy Bikers programme.

From the top of the bridge thrill-seekers will be able to see stunning views over much of Eastern Scotland

The bridge opened in 1964 and carries twice the weight and volume of traffic that it was originally designed for

The bridge is being opened to the public in July and August and visitors will only be able to take tours if the weather is fine.

In September there will also be a festival to celebrate 50 years of the structure.

Anne McMunn, of the Forth Bridges Festival, said: 'This something that's not available to members of the public normally.

'People will be able to enjoy amazing views from the top, and they will be able to say they've been up.'

She added: 'From the top on a clear day 
you can see Fife, Edinburgh, the Lothians and much of the east of 
Scotland, we are expecting demand for the tickets to be quite high.

'People who have been up there have said that at the top the cars and buses look like toys.'

Lesley Hinds, convenor of the Forth Estuary Transport Authority, which has co-organised the festival, said: 'Major bridges around the world are awe-inspiring and held in particular affection by the public. 

Anne McMunn, of the Forth Bridges festival, said that previous visitors to the top have said that cars and buses look like toys from the spectacular vantage point

'As the Forth Road Bridge prepares for 
its golden milestone, we are thrilled to be able to invite people to get
closer to it and experience it for themselves.' 

Demand is expected to be high as 1,000 tickets for the experience go on sale at 1pm on Wednesday.
