It was unquestionably 007's finest ever vehicle and now a particularly stunning version of the Aston Martin DB5 has sold for a new world record price at auction. 

One of the rarest of its kind ever made, the 1965 convertible model was bought for an eye-watering  £1.4 million at auction in Paris.

Sean Connery helped to immortalize the DB5 by driving one as James Bond in the 1964 film Goldfinger

The fee paid for the car was a record for a 1965 factory specification convertible, which is one of only 35 left hand drive ones ever made

This DB5 was manufactured in 1965 and was only one of 35 left hand drive models made, making it the Holy Grail of luxury car collectors.

The DB series was named in honour of David Brown who was the head of Aston Martin from1947 to 1972.

More than £2 million worth of prized Aston Martins were sold by Bonhams at its Grand Palais sale, with the DB5 selling for £1,430,715 - a new world record at auction for a factory specification 1965 convertible.

A 1962 convertible from the earlier DB4 series and one of only 70 only ever made attracted a winning bid of £750,000.

James Knight, Bonhams Group Motoring Director, said it was a tremendous start to 2015, adding: 'The Paris auction has been the most successful to date, with a record breaking price for the stunning Aston Martin DB5 convertible.

'Because only 35 were ever made in left-hand drive, this offering was a very rare find.

'There was international bidding for some stunning motor cars, and a record-breaking total for a motor car auction held by the Bonhams Group in continental Europe.

'The market is in rude health - we look forward to continuing the trend for record setting motoring auctions as the year progresses.'
