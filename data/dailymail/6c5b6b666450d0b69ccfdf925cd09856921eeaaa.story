London's notoriously windy weather almost got the better of the Countess of Wessex as she arrived at Westminster Abbey for the Queen's coronation celebrations.

Sporting a stunning white lace dress 
with a scalloped hem by favourite designer, Bruce Oldfield, and a beautiful white picture hat by milliner, Jane Taylor, the Countess looked elegant, although she struggled to keep her headgear in place.

But despite the unhelpful breeze, the wife of Prince Edward looked in good spirits as she made her way into the cathedral alongside her cheerfully grinning husband.

The white stuff: The Countess joined the Duchess of Cambridge and the Queen and plumped for a pale frock

The royal couple were accompanied by 
their nine-year-old daughter, Lady Louise Windsor, and their nieces, 
Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Their five-year-old son, Viscount Severn, was not at the Abbey but the rest of the the senior royals and crowned heads from all over Europe did make an appearance.

Like the Countess of Wessex, both the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall plumped for pale, summery shades as did Princess Michael of Kent.

The Queen, too, wore a suit made from ivory jacquard - the same colour in which she was crowned 53 years ago, as did her daughter, Princess Anne.

Two who chose more formal, dark colours were the princesses, Beatrice and Eugenie, who looked elegant in navy blue and teal dresses.Â

For the third time this year, Sophie Wessex appeared in a hat by milliner, Jane Taylor (pictured right).

For the Commonwealth memorial service, for the royal family's trip to church on Easter Sunday and now for the coronation celebrations at Westminster Abbey, the Countess chose creations by the Fulham-based milliner, who has been designing for just five years. So just who is Jane Taylor?

First launched in 2008, the designer began by creating one-off pieces for friends attending events such as the Henley Royal Regatta and Royal Ascot, but demand for the pieces quickly snowballed.

Five years on, the designer now creates bespoke hats for a veritable who's who of royal and jetset clients, as well as releasing three ready-to-wear collections per year.

In addition to the Countess of Wessex, other famous clients include the Duchess of Cambridge, Zara Phillips, Princess Eugenie and Princess Mary of Denmark, the glamorous Australian wife of the Scandinavian country's Crown Prince Frederik.
