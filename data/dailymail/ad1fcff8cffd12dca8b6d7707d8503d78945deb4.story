A rural campaigner was arrested and held by police for five hours after he put up a poster protesting plans to build a supermarket in a market town.

Ralph Rea, 64, affixed the poster - which featured the crossed-out faces of four former councillors below an 'Un-wanted' sign - to a noticeboard in Cardigan, mid-Wales.

He was arrested on suspicion of harassment after the former councillors, who had supported plans to build a Sainsbury's supermarket in the picturesque town, complained to police.

Outspoken: Ralph Rea was arrested and held by police for five hours after he put up a poster protesting plans to build a supermarket in a market town

Mr Rea has been outspoken in a long-running campaign against the plan.

He said: 'I have openly admitted putting up a small poster on a public notice board, as I have a perfect right to do.'

He said his arrest was a 'suppression of free speech' and added he felt 'victimised'.

He added: 'This is a massive overreaction.'

The poster, which was posted all over the town in the run-up to May's local government elections, was considered offensive and tantamount to harassment by some deposed town councillors.

Mr Rea has been a spokesman for the No To Bath House Project Campaign since the scheme to build a Sainsbury's store was given the green light two years ago.

He was arrested by police and held for five hours on May 11 following complaints over the poster, which Mr Rea attached to the notice board in the town's Finch Square.

The poster, which Mr Rea said he did not produce, carries pictures of former Cardigan town councillors David Grace, Linda Grace, Mair Morris and Alan Wilson with their faces crossed out below an 'Un-wanted' sign.

The poster accuses the quartet of 'gross-negligence and betrayal' in supporting the Bath House plans against the wishes of nearly 3,000 people who signed a petition opposing the move.

While Mair Morris and Alan Wilson stood down ahead of May's elections, David and Linda Grace, a three-time mayor, were both ousted from their seats on the council after 17 years.

The poster campaign may have played a part in their defeats at the polls.

Mr Rea said that the poster, which was also mailed to every household and business in Cardigan, is 'obviously not offensive' and added he did not know who produced it.

David and Linda Grace said they were 'unable to make any comment as it is an ongoing police investigation'.

A Dyfed-Powys Police spokesman said: 'Dyfed-Powys police arrested a 64-year-old man from the Cardigan area on 11 May on suspicion of harassment, and bailed pending further enquiries.'

Mr Rea was released on bail pending further inquiries.
