Police fighting to stop Eastern European migrants binge drinking in the street have put up posters in seven different languages saying that alcohol is banned.

Officers in Armley, West Yorkshire, had the message translated into Slovak, Czech, Polish, Russian, Latvian and Lithuanian. It is also written in English.

The area is home to a growing number of 
people from Eastern European countries who are drinking cans 
and bottles of alcohol in public.

Alcohol ban: Officers were forced to translate signs into seven different languages in this street in Armley, West Yorkshire

West Yorkshire Police have spent £3.3million over the last three years on translators.

They
have even deployed a Polish-speaking officer to the area so they can 
communicate effectively with the growing number of migrants.

Inspector
Mark Wheeler, senior neighbourhood officer for Armley, said that 
reports of street drinking in the area had been 'on the increase due to 
Eastern Europeans coming and not fully understanding the regulations.'

He
added: 'While those involved in street drinking in the area are not 
confined to any one specific community, we are aware that a proportion 
of those involved are from Eastern European countries.

'We need people to understand the restrictions without language being a barrier.

'The
leaflets and posters will mean that when officers encounter people from
these communities who are in breach of the order they won’t be able to 
claim ignorance of the law as an excuse.'

Off-licence
worker Rashid Ali, from Armley Convenience Store, said the 
multi-lingual measures were a 'good idea' but agreed the street drinking
problem - one he regularly experiences - was a cross-nationality one.

Police said they had to put up the sign in several different languages because migrants simply did not understand that they were breaking the law.

They brought in the signs so people cannot plead for leniency claiming they could not read the English signs.

The signs have been placed in the front of shops and pubs along the street which runs through the centre of Armley on the outskirts of Leeds.

Anyone caught drinking in the street faces being fined £500. Although the ban was brought in two years ago the rules have been repeatedly flouted.
