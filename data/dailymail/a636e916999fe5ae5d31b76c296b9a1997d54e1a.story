Premier League clubs could have signed Alexis Sanchez for as little as £2million had they shown enough belief in him, the man who brought him to Europe has claimed.

Udinese president Giampaolo Pozzo, who bought Sanchez from Corbreloa for that price back in 2006, said bigger clubs were aware of the attacking prodigy but he chose to move to Italy because they were the first to show faith in his ability.

'The big clubs, not just English, had sensed the deal but we were good at getting the player first when he was not yet known,' Pozzo told The Sun. 'He wanted to sign for us because firstly, he wanted to come to Europe and then because we were the first to believe in him.

Sanchez was sent out on loan for two seasons by Udinese before returning to their first team

'Our scouts in South America saw his unquestionable technical qualities. But, from when we started following him, he also had a personality that was out of the ordinary for a boy of that age.'

Udinese loaned Sanchez to Colo-Colo and Argentine giants River Plate before finally bringing him back to play in their first team. 

He flourished in Italy, making his name in three remarkable seasons at the club. 

One man with first hand experience of playing with Sanchez is Watford striker Matej Vydra, who was at Udinese at the same time.

He said: 'He will help Arsenal's players. When at Udinese, every day he tried to make his team-mates better and it's good when someone helps you. He was young but was like a coach and wanted to help.' 

Sanchez's form ultimately saw him picked up by then-European Champions Barcelona, who paid £30m for his services in 2011. 

And after three seasons with the Catalan club, in which he scored 39 goals in 88 league appearances, Arsenal paid £30m to bring him to the Premier League. 

Sanchez has excelled since joining Arsenal for £30m during the summer, and is their top scorer
