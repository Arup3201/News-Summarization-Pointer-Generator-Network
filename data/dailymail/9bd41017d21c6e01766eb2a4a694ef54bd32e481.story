Room for a small one? Developer Peter Hunter certainly thought so and managed to squeeze a detached home between these two semis.

The house, measuring just 14ft wide, is probably one of the thinnest in Britain. But despite its slim nature, it has three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a living room and dining room.

Mr Hunter, 70, views the property as an ingenious way of converting derelict land into ‘a nice family home’. Unsurprisingly, his neighbours are not quite as enthusiastic – having found he has only left a four-inch gap between the buildings.

Slim fit: Developer Peter Hunter is building a detached house in the 14ft gap between two existing homes after getting planning permission from Manchester City Council

Detached: Residents have been left concerned after a gap of just four inches was left between the house and the buildings on either side

Development: Mr Hunter spotted the gap and developed the idea of converting the derelict land into 'a nice family home'

Drive: The space where Mr Hunter decided to build a house looks like the perfect size to park a car

The property, in Northenden, Manchester, has even blocked out a window on the gable end of one of the houses.

Residents
were astonished after it was given permission by Manchester City Council. 
Nikki Cooper, 40, who overlooks the plot, said: ‘It’s stupid and it’s 
crazy. Our main concern is the gap. It is so narrow…you could get litter
and dead rats there.’

Yesterday Mr Hunter refused to comment on the protests and would only say: ‘The project is coming along very nicely.’

The narrowest house in Britain is just nine foot wide and was built in Suffolk.

Residents: Neighbours were left astonished when Manchester City Council gave planning permission for the house to be built
