One of the women who won £100,000 in February 2007, last known to be living in London, had just £25 invested in Premium Bonds

More than £44million in Premium Bond prizes have not been claimed since the popular savings product was introduced nearly 60 years ago.

National Savings & Investments is urging anybody who have Premium Bonds to check whether or not they have won a prize - but never claimed it.

A record 898,000 prizes have not been claimed, with an average amount of £50 although two women have failed to claim an eye-watering £100,000 each.

Several other prizes worth £25,000 and £50,000 have also been left abandoned.

Unlike the National Lottery, there is no time limit imposed on when you can claim a prize. The National Lottery imposes a 180-day deadline from the day of the draw.

NS&I, the Government’s savings arm, said it will hold onto people’s prize money until they step forward to claim it.

A spokesman said: ‘Each unclaimed prize is held until the rightful winner can be tracked down.’ The oldest unclaimed prize involves a man, last known to be living in South Yorkshire, who won a prize of £25 in November 1957.

One of the women who won £100,000 in February 2007, last known to be living in London, had just £25 invested in Premium Bonds.

Many winners are likely to be people who were bought Premium Bonds as children but have completely forgotten about them.

Others have moved house but never told NS&I about their new address.

Jill Waters, operations manager at 
NS&I, said: ‘Prizes often become unclaimed as a result of people 
moving house, or forgetting that Bonds have been bought for them as a 
child, or executors are unaware the Bonds are held when someone dies.’

If you think you may be one of the winners, you have two options. The easiest option - if you have your Premium Bond holder’s number - is to use the search facility on the NS&I website.

Alternatively, you can write a letter to NS&I to ask whether or not you have any unclaimed prizes.

The address to write to is: ‘Premium Bonds, National Savings and Investments, Glasgow, G58 1SB.’ If possible, you should include your Premium Bond numbers, your name, any former names, such as your maiden name, your current address and any previous addresses.

If the Premium Bonds were bought for you as a child, NS&I said it would be a good idea to include the address of your childhood home.

Premium Bonds, which are tax-free, pay out prize money every month, rather than paying interest. The maximum prize is £1million a month, although all these prizes have been claimed.

The largest National Lottery prize which has not been claimed was a Euromillions prize of £63million last year. The amount was donated to good causes.

Premium Bonds were launched by the Chancellor Harold Macmillan in his 1956 Budget.
