The Rev Paul Shackerley said he now regrets using inappropriate language on Facebook

A Church of England vicar has apologised for some unholy language on his Facebook page, his bishop said.

Canon Paul Shackerley, Vicar of the Minster Church of St George in Doncaster, raised eyebrows by using the f-word and remarking that 'alas, I have religion tomorrow' in some postings.

Peter Burrows, the bishop of Doncaster, met with Dr Shackerley yesterday and later said the priest regretted the inappropriate language and had removed it.

'Whilst meant in a jocular sense, he recognises that some of the language was unfitting.

'He has apologised unreservedly,' Burrows said in a statement posted on the diocesan website.

'I have received Paul's letter of apology and have been assured that this will not happen again.'

Dr Shackerley - who has facial piercings, including one in his tongue - is one of Yorkshire's most high-profile vicars.

Church officials were alerted to his Facebook comments earlier this year by an anonymous letter, and sparked concern among parishioners.

The social networking extracts were sent, along with the letter, to senior clergy including the Bishop of Sheffield, Dr Steven Croft, and the Bishop of Doncaster.

Also copied in to the correspondence were the Lord Lieutenant of South Yorkshire, David Moody, who represents the Queen, elected mayor of Doncaster Peter Davies and the Sheffield Diocesan Secretary.

The posts begin at around 7pm on a Saturday and say: ‘I think I will put my feet up. 

‘I've done f*** all today other than jazz lesson and visit a friend. I hear the fizz of tonic in my gin beckoning.

‘Alas, I have religion tomorrow. At least I'm not preaching this week.

‘Preaching next week at St Mary Abbotts Kensington though. Best make that a good one eh?’

The comments were ‘liked’ by eight of Dr Shackerley's Facebook friends, including Doncaster Minster's director of music, Darren Williams, and prompted more foul language in response from a separate contributor.

In his next post, Dr Shackerley wrote: ‘Stop swearing. There will be others watching in.’

After further conversation he arranged to meet with friends for ‘a drinkie’ in Peterborough on Saturday, March 17, and said he would be driving back to Doncaster that night in time for church the next morning.

Dr Shackerley also uploaded a photograph of his posing next to a snowman he called Snowy, which was accompanied by a number of messages, including: ‘Forgive my sin of frivolity. Sin is such fun! 

'But, I haven't been having inappropriate relationship with snowy, who can longer be called a "snowman" in the name of political correctness.

A few of Canon Dr Paul Shackerley, Vicar of Doncaster's statements on Facebook:

'Has anyone got any ideas about what gender Snowy is? As the Bishop of Sheffield invites, "answers on a postcard of a few sheets of A4..." But, he was talking about gospel and mission. I'm talking about Snowy!:-)’

Dr Shackerley also posted: ‘P**s myself! H, you are so funny!!! It was good to share over lunch yesterday and at the URC Homelessness "event". I say "event". It was hardly worship, was it?

'I hope you managed to get home okay. It was late by the time the URC and Methodists finished. Good job we are Anglicans eh?’

The letter which accompanies the extracts says: ‘Your priest colleague uses language that most would find abhorrent for a man in his position and pretty distasteful for anyone as a matter of fact.

‘I understand that senior members of the Diocese know of this document, but no action appears to have been taken.

‘His present behaviour makes him totally unfit to serve the Minster or the people of Doncaster, and totally unfit to serve the church at all in the opinion of many Doncaster residents.’

In an April newsletter to parishioners, Dr Shackerley spoke of the pitfalls of internet sites like Facebook in the wake of the case of a 21-year-old student who used Twitter to racially abuse stricken footballer Fabrice Muamba.

He said: ‘I have known employees receive disciplinary and dismissal notices for inappropriate postings.’

Earlier, the Bishop of Doncaster had said: ‘I think we all know that things like Facebook, Twitter and other social media are immediate ways of communicating "in the moment".

‘But we do as clergy need to be very conscious of making the distinction between something that might have what I would call a work focus and something that might have a more personal or private focus.

‘Obviously for clergy these two lives are often not completely separate.'

‘There are a number of quite complex and difficult issues for the church that have been raised by this [Dr Shackerley's case].

‘We do take seriously the complainants' comments.’
