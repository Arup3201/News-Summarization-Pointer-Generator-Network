It was an embarrassing start for President Obama's re-election campaign yesterday as he held his first political rally of the 2012 race in a half-empty arena.

With wife Michelle dressed head to toe in campaign colors at his side, Obama targeted swing states Ohio and Virginia that are critical for his bid to remain in the White House.

The President formally launched his Chicago-based re-election effort last year but his official political events have been confined to fundraisers since then.

Scant support: Obama's rally for the 2012 presidential race at Ohio State University appeared to have a poor turnout

Rousing: President Obama addressed his first official campaign rally in Ohio Saturday after releasing an email to encourage supporters to watch the rally and donate money

That changed this weekend, however, with results which may have surprised Obama.

The President, who was propelled to power in the 2008 election thanks in part to huge rallies across the nation, hoped to regain that momentum with events in large arenas in Columbus, Ohio and Richmond, Virginia.

Come game time, however, with his first event - which was free and open to the public - held at Ohio State University, his numbers appeared to fall flat, according to several reports.

One photo taken and posted to Twitter by Republican rival Mitt Romney's campaign spokesman Ryan Williams showed the floor and seats with more space than people.

The venue holds 20,000 and according to figures from Obama's campaign, 14,000 attended the event - 70 per cent of the stadium's seating capacity.

According to the paper, event organisers busied themselves moving people from the stage's surrounding seats to the arena's floor to depict a better crowd to television cameras.

GOP forecast: The Republican National Committee earlier released their own prepared remarks for the president which forecast a tepid audience

Aiming to encourage his supporters, Obama released an email prior to his rally reminding them to watch his first rally and donate money.

'The
crowd's starting to form in Columbus, and they're ready to go,' he said
in the email. 'In a little while, I'll go on stage for the first rally 
of 2012.'

Obama's campaign is eager to get the president on the road and at the center of the political battle.

'We're ready to go,' campaign manager Jim Messina told reporters in a recent conference call.

'While
Mitt Romney has been busy endearing himself to the Tea Party and making
promises he can't keep, we've been busy building the largest grassroots
campaign in modern American history.'

The Republican National Committee 
released their own email earlier Saturday morning, however, in the mocking form of fake 
prepared remarks for the president's rally in Columbus.

'Ohio,
thanks for the tepid welcome. I know I'm not as popular here as I once 
was, so I'll take what I can get,' the RNC said in the imagined speech 
it dubbed 'as prepared for reality.'

True blue: The First Lady, wearing campaign colours from head to foot, also addressed the Ohio crowd

Support: Obama is traveling to Ohio and Virginia where he will hold rallies and officially begin his re-election bid for the 2012 US Presidential election

'It
turns out the hope and change I promised didn't work out. So, we've 
launched a new strategy: hype and blame,' the RNC's email said.

Since Mr Romney became his party's presumptive nominee, Mr Obama has criticised his opponent in formal and informal situations - a sign that he is more than ready to launch the attacks that are expected to characterise a potentially ugly and negative campaign.Â 

Republicans accuse Mr Obama of infusing politics into his official White House events and scoff at the notion that his campaigning is just starting.

The president has done official trips in recent months to highlight his energy record and to tout proposals to reduce costs for students. Young people are an important constituency for his campaign.

The Obama campaign has mapped out several scenarios to win the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency, and the choice of states for his inaugural rallies was not coincidental.

Ohio, with its large cache of 18 electoral votes, is a particularly coveted prize.

Capacity: According to reports, the event filled just 14,000 of its 20,000 capacity which was free and open to the public

No Republican has made it to the White House in the last century without winning the state. Obama bested Republican rival John McCain there in 2008.

Ohio has struggled with a loss of manufacturing jobs, but its unemployment rate, at 7.5 per cent in March, is below the national average, which was 8.2 per cent in March and dipped to 8.1 per cent in April.

That could help blunt Mr Romney's attacks on Mr Obama's economic record. The president's campaign also hopes to capitalize on union anger over an attempt by the state's Republican governor, John Kasich, to limit collective bargaining rights for firefighters, police officers, and other state workers. The law was later repealed.

Polls show Mr Obama is leading Mr Romney in Ohio and Virginia. An average of polls by RealClearPolitics showed the president ahead in Ohio by 4.2 percentage points and ahead in Virginia by 3.2 percentage points.

Virginia had an even lower unemployment rate in March, coming in at 5.6 percent.

The Obama campaign will also try to capitalize on an advantage with women voters in the state, where the governor - Republican Bob McDonnell - promoted legislation that would have required women to undergo an invasive trans-vaginal sonogram before getting an abortion.

Mr Obama's wife, Michelle, will also help attract the female vote. The popular first lady, who has done fundraisers across the country for her husband's campaign, will be at his side for both rallies.
