Football has its first £1 billion man – but it’s not Beckham, Messi or Ronaldo.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal him to be ‘super-agent’ Jorge Mendes, who has masterminded transfers worth an eye-watering £1,068,370,548 over the course of his career.

Portuguese Mendes, 48, a former nightclub owner who became a football agent 18 years ago, has negotiated £208.5 million worth of signings in the last two months alone.

With a typical ‘take’ of ten per cent commission per deal, the friend and adviser to Cristiano Ronaldo and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will have pocketed more than £20 million in this summer’s transfer window, and more than £100 million in commissions during his career.

That figure doesn’t even take into account his earnings from the £6 million deadline-day loan fee paid by Manchester United to Monaco for striker Radamel Falcao. The transfer could eventually cost United £51.3 million – bringing another big pay day for Mendes.

The power broker, who speaks five languages and has four mobile phones, is hailed by Ronaldo as a ‘fair and honest man’ who he trusts ‘completely’.

Mendes oversaw two of the summer’s three biggest transfers – of Angel di Maria from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and James Rodriguez from Monaco to Real Madrid

Chelsea manager Mourinho says Mendes encourages players to ‘respect their commitments’ to clubs, while former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson says Mendes is ‘the best agent I dealt with, without a doubt’.

Mendes oversaw two of the summer’s three biggest transfers – of Angel di Maria from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and James Rodriguez from Monaco to Real Madrid.

The son of a gas plant worker, Mendes grew up in Lisbon and had a modest career as a semi-professional footballer before running a nightclub and then becoming an agent.

He now has 58 names on his client list.
