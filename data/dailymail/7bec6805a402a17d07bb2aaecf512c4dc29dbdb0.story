Abbey Crouch has been announced as the model who will close the Fashion for The Brave Gala catwalk this year, in an original design by fashion icon Julien McDonald.

The British fashion star will follow in the footsteps of designers such as Vivienne Westwood and Jasper Conran who have produced amazing dresses for the gala in previous years.

Abbey, who has been wowing the judges on BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing, will close the show in McDonald’s daring sequined design.

The design will feature tiny Union Jacks, which will create a sparkling iridescent pattern with risque nude sheer panelling at the sides

The model is no stranger to Julien's daring designs - she was photographed at the Attitude awards last month in a very sexy black dress with sheer panels.

Every year a celebrated designer creates a spectacular one-of-a-kind patriotic dress for a model personality to showcase at the Fashion for The Brave Gala.

It seems Julien, who was also a contestant on this year’s Strictly, seems to have taken inspiration from the show's infamous dazzling costumes.

The bubbly Welshman found himself the third celebrity to be voted off the hit show two weeks ago, but obviously bears no grudge against his former competitor Abbey.

The gown Abbey will wear is a red, blue and white floor length bodycon dress.

Tiny Union Jacks create a sparkling iridescent pattern with nude sheer panelling at the sides to create a risque barely-there feel. 

The glitzy dress will no doubt impress the crowds at the gala, which is expected to be attended by its royal patron, HRH Princess Beatrice.

The gala and the fashion show, which has being organised by Hilary Alexander OBE and Lesley Goring, will be held at the Dorchester Hotel on November 8.

An auction will also be held at the glamorous event to raise money for the charities.

This year Fashion for The Brave Gala is supporting the Household Cavalry Foundation and Soldiering On.

The Household Cavalry is made up of Britain’s two most senior Regiments, The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals.

The Household Cavalry Foundation cares for the casualties, serving soldiers, veterans, horses and heritage of the Household Cavalry.

The Soldiering On Through Life Trust recognise outstanding achievements of teams or individuals from within the Armed Forces and raise sustainable funds for the military charities which support injured Service personnel and their families throughout life.
