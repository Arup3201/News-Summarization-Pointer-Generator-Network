Festival-goers making their way to the Isle of Wight for this weekend's Bestival festival were 
treated to sunshine and warm weather as they crossed the Channel on Thursday.

Thousands
 of revellers flocked to the island's Robin Hill National 
Park where Outkast and Foals are among those headlining the four-day event. Acts including Sam Smith, 
Paloma Faith and Basement Jaxx are also scheduled to perform.

Meanwhile, temperatures reached a balmy 23.7C in parts of Britain on Thursday – after a low-lying blanket of fog and mist lifted to reveal glorious sunshine.

Most of Britain woke up to overcast skies this morning with a thick covering of mist present in most high areas.

However,
 the haze is expected to dissipated by and parts of the country saw temperatures in the low 20s. Including Whitechurch in Wales which saw a high of 23.7C on Thursday,

Forecasters at the Met Office predict the pleasant weather will make Thursday the warmest day of the next seven – as above-average temperatures for September continue.

It will also be a balmy 23C in London and parts of the South East, with temperatures hovering around the early twenties for the rest of the country.

Meanwhile at Bestival, revellers can expect to stay dry and warm this weekend, with only a low chance of rain forecast.

Organisers of the annual event have a few unusual attractions ready for those attending - including a 10ft-tall disco ball which the Bestival team hope will break the current Guinness World Record for the world's biggest.

Laura Young, a spokesperson for the Met Office, said: ‘Most places will be in the early twenties today so it will be quite warm and pleasant.

‘There’s been some mist, fog and low cloud, particularly in the east and central parts this morning, but it does break up quite quickly.’

‘The best of the sunshine will be along South coast in the South West, Western Wales and East Anglia and, although there will be sunshine in London, there will also be variable cloud.

‘On the whole it’s a good dry day, with settled conditions and it will be nice and warm.’

The warm weather is set to continue into the weekend as well, with temperatures expected to remain in the early twenties until at least Sunday.

Although a band of rain may move down across Scotland and the North East overnight and into Friday, it is thought it will be remain mostly dry elsewhere in the country.

Despite the recent above-average temperatures for this time of year, there will be more cloud from tomorrow onwards and it will start to feel cooler at night.

Mist and fog will also be prevalent on higher ground over the next few mornings, particularly on Saturday, which, according to forecasters, is due to the warmer-than-average days and longer night-time periods.

Over the weekend, Saturday will be slightly cloudier but there will still be sunny intervals while Sunday will see prolonged periods of sunshine making it the best day to get out and about.

However, despite widespread sun across most parts of the UK on Sunday, parts of Scotland including Aberdeenshire could see some isolated heavy showers.

Temperatures will hover around the early twenties mark, but will start to drop by a few degrees as the beginning of next week approaches – marking a return to the more average temperatures expected at this time of year.
