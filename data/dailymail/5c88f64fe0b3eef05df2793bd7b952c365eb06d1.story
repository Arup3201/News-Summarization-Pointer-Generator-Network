For a fit young police officer keen to get out of the office and into the fresh air, it is the ideal assignment.

No wonder 664 applied for the 36 places in the squad guarding the Olympic torch on its 70-day journey around the country before the London Games.

Yesterday the chosen few seemed to be taking their duties in their stride during a dress rehearsal between Leicester and Peterborough.

Yet just in case they find the job too traumatic, they are to be given psychological training on how to prepare themselves for being away from home.

And after their two-month jaunt, they will be offered counselling to help them ‘reintegrate’ into the Metropolitan force.

The officers will see occupational health specialists and even career advisers to help them settle back into their day jobs.

Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s absurd that after two months guarding the Olympic torch, officers will be stuck in counselling rather than fighting crime.

'These nanny-state proposals are a waste of police time and taxpayers’ money. Officers should be allowed to get on with the job they are paid for, not mollycoddled after what will likely be a fantastic experience.’

A core team of 28 officers plus eight reserves will take turns to run some or all of the daily 30-mile distance.

They will form part of a wider 70-strong team selected from the Met to follow the relay and help with traffic control, security and event management.

During the trial run yesterday, male and female officers wore grey shorts and T-shirts, and wore ‘bum bags’ to hold their radios, water and suntan lotion as they accompanied the torchbearers.

The atmosphere was somewhat muted because the torches were not lit, spectators were not encouraged to line the streets and there was no evening entertainment.

During the actual relay, which begins at Land’s End on May 18, police could have to deal with saboteurs, protesters and terrorism.

They will also be thrust into the media spotlight – something Scotland Yard said could be unsettling for officers.

A spokesman for the Met said: ‘We recognise that this is a unique role never performed within British policing.

Mindful of the fact that officers will be taken away from their homes for 70 days and encouraged to live as part of a team, their reintegration back into the Met after the event is already being carefully planned.

‘Occupational health specialists within the Met are already developing plans to ensure that the welfare of this team is considered at every stage and the best possible support provided.’

The spokesman said that preparations included ‘talking to them about their career aspirations and encouraging them to plan ahead for when they are away from home’.

On its journey to the opening ceremony on July 27, the torch will be carried by 7,300 nominated members of the public, with athletes and celebrities making up the remaining 700.

Each will carry the flame for about 300 yards and about 110 people will take part each day.

The officers chosen for the security team are said to be ‘among the fittest’ in the force.

Yesterday, between four and seven Met runners at a time flanked the torchbearers for a gentle jog through the streets.

They were also escorted by a police cyclist, named only as ‘Cyclist One’.

The rehearsal began just after 7am at a car park in Leicester outside the National Space Centre.

Hotel worker and gap-year student Jasmine Vanmali, 19, was the first of 122 volunteers to run with the torch.

She said: ‘I’m excited but really cold. I just wish the flame was lit so I could get some heat from it. Holding the metal is making me even colder. I just want to get moving.’
