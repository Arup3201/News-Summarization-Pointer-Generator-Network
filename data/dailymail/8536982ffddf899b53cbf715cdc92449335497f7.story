Spotting the early signs of Alzheimers is essential in helping sufferers of the condition to get the treatment they need.

Now, the Alzheimers Society are using the festive period to help raise awareness of the condition - particularly important over Christmas when people may be 
seeing relatives for the first time in months and notice changes in 
behaviour.

As part of the campaign, celebrities such
as Lynda Bellingham and John Challis – Only Fools & Horses’ Boycie –
will share their favourite Christmas memories on a Tumblr blog alongside Oscar-nominated actress Carey Mulligan and David Cameron.

Campaign: David Cameron, Carey Mulligan and Dominic and Jilly Batty gathered at Downing Street today to help launch the dementia campaign

Alzheimers currently affects 800,000 people in the UK and that number is rapidly growing, so it was with that in mind that Carey and the Prime Minister gathered at Downing Street this morning to launch the campaign.

Carey, star of forthcoming film The Great Gatsby, and Cameron shared some of their favourite Christmas memories.

Carey spoke about Christmasses with her grandmother ‘Nans’ while the Prime Minister shared a story about rushing son Ivan from hospital down to Devon in time for a family Christmas.

Support: The campaign offers support and advice for those who worry their relatives may be suffering

They were joined by Dominic Batty, who
lives with dementia, and wife Jill to launch the campaign Christmas to 
Remember by hanging a Dementia Friends bauble on the Number 10 tree.

Carey is encouraging people returning home for Christmas to look out for signs that a loved one may be living with dementia.

Carey, whose grandmother 'Nans' has dementia, said: ‘My favourite Christmas memory is every Christmas we spent with my grandmother.

'She used to alternate between us and our cousins and every year we were lucky enough to have her was particularly precious.

'This Christmas we want people to tell us about their favourite Christmas memory - it can be funny, sad, silly or serious.

'Write a memory on a piece of paper, take a photo and tweet using #xmas2remember or comment at facebook.com/alzheimerssociety’.

Jeremy Hughes, Chief Executive at Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘Christmas is a time when families who may not see each other all year come together.

'If you are worried about your own or a loved one’s memory or think they might have dementia it’s important to know that there is help and support available. 

'This year you can follow advice and information on the internet or call our National Dementia Helpline.

'You can also give yourself the gift of becoming more dementia aware by registering your interest in becoming a dementia friend.'

Prime Minister David Cameron added: ’Dementia is one of the biggest challenges facing our population today which is why I launched the Dementia Challenge and am supporting the Dementia Friends project. 

'There are already nearly 700,000 people in England with dementia who need support, but hundreds of thousands of them aren’t diagnosed and aren’t receiving the help they need.

'We may not want to think about dementia at Christmas time, but spotting the signs of dementia as soon as they start is the best way to help our friends and family keep the memories they make for as long as possible.

'That’s why I’m launching the Christmas to Remember campaign and encouraging everyone to share their Christmas memories. 

'By working together to raise awareness of the signs we can tackle this dreadful disease and make Christmas a happier time for millions.’

Calls to Alzheimer’s Society National Dementia Helpline increase by a third immediately after Christmas, many of these calls are from worried relatives. The number to call is 0300 222 1122.

What are the early signs of dementia?

Dementia is not a single illness but a group of symptoms caused by damage to the brain. The symptoms include:

Christmas can be a very stressful time for people with dementia (posed by models)

•    Memory loss. We all forget where we have put our keys or to pass on a message from time to time. But when memory problems start to interfere with day to day life, or if early memories become easier to remember than more recent ones, this could be an early sign of dementia. •    Problems thinking or reasoning, or finding it hard to follow conversations or TV programmes•    Feeling anxious, depressed or angry about memory loss, or feeling confused, even when in a familiar environmentWhat should someone do if they are worried about a loved one’s memory

If you are worried that someone may have dementia, try and encourage them to visit their GP to get a proper diagnosis.

Alzheimer's Society provides tips on how to raise the topic of dementia with a loved one. These include:

•    Be positive - a diagnosis can give people access to the help and support they need, or the GP can help you rule out dementia and treat other symptoms. •    Make notes of situations that have got you worried. Giving examples will help you to express yourself in a clear and real way.•    Make sure it's an open conversation and be a good listener. Allow the person to discuss their feelings and thoughts  

People with dementia at Christmas

Christmas can be a very stressful time for people with dementia - from the confusion of battling with panic-stricken shoppers for presents to the disorientation of spending the day in a packed and potentially unfamiliar house.  Alzheimer’s Society has compiled some top tips for having a guest with dementia this Christmas:

•    Plan ahead: If the house is unfamiliar to your guest, putting labels on doors could help – for example, the bathroom, the kitchen. •    Think about safety: make sure you leave lights on and doors opens so the person with dementia is less likely to get confused if they’re up at night. •    Don’t overload your guest’s plate at dinner time. Although many people eat a lot at Christmas, a full plate can be quite daunting for someone who has difficulties eating. •    Think of some activities the person may enjoy doing in quieter moments. Try to involve people in your own activities, such as walking or cooking.•    If the house becomes very busy, designate a 'quiet room'  and agree not to watch television or listen to music in there. •    It might be enjoyable for the person to sing carols – it’s good to do something jointly with other people but singing also stimulates both mind and body.
