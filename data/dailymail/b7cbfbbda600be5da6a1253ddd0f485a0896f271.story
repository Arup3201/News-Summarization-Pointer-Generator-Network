Roma captain Francesco Totti has launched an astonishing attack on Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli, saying he 'doesn't listen to anyone.'

Totti was sent off kicking out at the then-Inter Milan striker four years ago as his Roma side lost the Coppa Italia final 1-0.

And it appears his opinion hasn't changed as he was quoted as saying: 'I would not give advice to Balotelli. Everyone tries to, but he does not listen to anyone.'

Francesco Totti does not believe that striker Mario Balotelli will ever improve his attitude

He echoed the thoughts of Italy coach Antonio Conte, who told Raisport before the friendly against Albania: 'I'm not so arrogant as to claim that I'm different from the great coaches, but the past tells us that they failed to change Balotelli.

'It'll be up to the player, but I don't have much time and I need certain things.' 

Balotelli has struggled to impress at Liverpool since his transfer from AC Milan in August.

He has only scored twice, once in the Champions League and once in the League Cup, and he has floundered in his attempts to lead Liverpool's attack in the absence of Daniel Sturridge.

Balotelli's woes were compounded last week when he was ruled out of Italy's Euro 2016 qualifier against Croatia with a muscle injury, but is expected to be fit to play for Liverpool against Crystal Palace on Sunday.
