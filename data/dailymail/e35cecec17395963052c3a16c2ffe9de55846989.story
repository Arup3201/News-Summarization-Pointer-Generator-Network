Union County Sheriff David Taylor said: ‘He planned to kill another sex offender on the register today,’ reported Fox News.

Mr Moody murdered 59-year-old Parker on Sunday.

Surveillance cameras outside his home show the couple driving up to the house that morning.

They allegedly pretended their car was broken, and were invited inside. They are filmed walking inside with weapons.

Mr Parker and his wife Gretchen, 51,  were shot and stabbed. Sherriff Taylor said Gretchen was only killed as she happened to be home at the time.

The community where it happened is located 80 miles northwest of Columbia

The sheriff said Moody told Charles Parker: ‘You think I'm here to rob you. I'm not here to rob you. I'm here to kill you because you are a child molester.’

Mr Moody had allegedly planned to kill Mr Parker last year, but decided not to.

Moody has skinhead tattooed across his neck, and confessed to police after he was arrested.

There is currently an investigation on-going to find out if he has been involved in other crimes. They are also seeing if he is involved in any white supremacist groups. 

The bodies were discovered on Monday when another person arrived at the house to have his car fixed.

The incident happened about 80 miles northwest of Columbia.

Charles Parker was convicted of third-degree criminal sexual conduct about ten years ago.
