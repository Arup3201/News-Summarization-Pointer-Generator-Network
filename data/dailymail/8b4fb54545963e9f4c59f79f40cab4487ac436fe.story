A Missouri family who adopted five orphaned siblings from Peru has opened up about their life-changing decision on The View, as a local university donated $500,000 worth of scholarships to help pay for the children's education.

Scott and Lauren Sterling with their daughters Logan, 19, and Laney, 3, described how God told them to welcome the siblings into their home and said taking the leap of faith was 'so worth it.'

However, Scott explained on Wednesday's show that he took some time to come around to the idea, as he was initially terrified by the financial burden bringing another five children into his home would create.

'At first, (we) thought some rich family should adopt these kids and we are clearly not that,' he said. 'I am very practical and logical so I had to process through all of that and the enormous responsibility of that.'

He said he was praying at church on Easter Sunday, when it became clear they had to be the ones to give these kids a better life.

'At that moment I felt like God turned the intercom button on and said you know "I didn't ask you about the kids, I asked if you were willing,"' he said.

'It was that moment I couldn't choose comfort over.. these kids just wanted parents. And instead of choosing comfort I chose to do that.'

Yhonson, 17, Gerson, 15, Betsi, 12, Joel, 11, and Sibila, nine, touched down in December, after an adoption process that lasted a year-and-a-half.

The children said on The View that they were enjoying school, and becoming accustomed to life in the states, where they recently saw snow for the first time.

Scott said the language barrier had been interesting, but the kids' English was very good and improving rapidly.

'It's been funny and very interesting at times,' he said. 'Like they called the other day and he said 'I have hungry' or they will say 'I am boring' instead of 'I am bored' so it has been interesting, it's been fun.

'The kids really know a lot more 
English. I don't know Spanish and they can understand me, it's just when
they're nervous they don't like to make a mistake by talking back in 
English.'

The family are 
moving to a bigger home in a few weeks to better accommodate their new 
family, which more than doubled in size after the siblings sent them an 
email imploring: 'We need a mommy and daddy' more than two years ago.

Scott said despite the cost, he doesn't regret the family's decision for a second.

'I can just say when God asks you to do something it's so worth it,' he said on The View.

'There's nothing that compares to it. The first time we saw the kids at the orphanage they came running from off in the distance, about 50 yards and jumped up in our arms. Even after two months that we've had them now, it feels like they've always been ours.'

when the president of Avilla University in Kansas City stood up during 
the program to announce the scholarships, saying how moved the school 
was to hear their story.

'The practical side of me is sighing relief,' Scott said. 'That is amazing, thanks you so much. Unbelievable.'

The
Sterling's saw their small family expand more than double after they 
adopted the five orphaned siblings from Peru who had sent them an email 
imploring: 'We need a mommy and daddy.'

Their new children are now settling into school and home life in Blue Springs, where they saw snow for the first time after arriving down in December.

Before the life-changing move, they spent seven years living in an orphanage after their parents died from tuberculosis. The children refused to be split up, making adoption seem unlikely.

New additions: Scott and Lauren Sterling (back) already had two children, Logan, 19, (right) and Laney, 3, when they took in the orphans: Yhonson, 17, Gerson, 15, Betsi, 12, Joel, 11, and Sibila, 9

But in January 2011, they met an 
American visiting the orphanage who helped them write the pleading email
to send back to his friends in the United States.

When Lauren and Scott Sterling received the message, they didn't think too much of it.

'I remember Scott and I looking at that 
e-mail and thinking about how beautiful the kids were,' Lauren, 30, wrote on her blog. 'I even 
thought, "Someone rich should adopt them". And then life went on.'

Shortly after, Lauren took a trip to an orphanage in Guatemala and was 
devastated by how many young babies were without parents while her own 
daughter had the security of a home.

Then she started thinking about those five beautiful faces she had seen in the email.

'Somebody's got to do it, and why can't it be us?' Lauren said to her husband.

'We may eat a lot of spaghetti. I 
will never buy another $100 pair of jeans again, and who cares? If those
are my reasons, it's just practicality,' she told Fox4ck.

And so they embarked on the year-long 
battle to bring the children from Peru to Missouri, hitting numerous 
roadblocks along the way, including missing identification records for 
the children.

But over chats on Skype and visits to Peru, the Sterlings soon learned the different personalities of the children and began to think of them as their own.

'We got told "no" a lot of times, and by 
then we were already crazy about these kids, so it was a rough part of 
the story,' Mrs Sterling told Fox News. 'And you had to keep trusting that
we were fighting for something that you knew was yours to fight for.'

Sticking together: The children had been in the orphanage for seven years after their parents died of TB

With the help of members of their 
church, the Sterlings raised the $85,000 needed for the adoptions to 
bring the children to their new home before Christmas.

One particularly excited member of 
the welcoming committee at the airport was 19-year-old Logan, who had not 
seen her father, stepmother or little sister since they left for Peru 
five weeks prior.

She said she could not wait to meet her five new brothers and sisters.

'I haven't met them, know the personalities, know who they are,' she said. 'I'm excited about that.'

The Sterlings returned to their home to find it had been scrubbed clean by the community, with a stocked kitchen, Christmas presents wrapped under the trees and new bedrooms for the children.

New life: The children are now attending U.S. schools and their English is improving all the time

'People painted beds, people framed 
pictures - people made the girls' room look like they had lived
here for years. It was awesome to come home to that,' Lauren said.

They also returned to a garden full of snow, which the youngsters had never seen before.

Life has picked up pace in the Sterling household. Scott, 43, runs a lawn care business, while Lauren has given up her recruiting job to stay at home full time.

The children's English is improving and they have started attending four different schools because of their ages, making for some busy mornings in the home.

'The sound of life is different,' Lauren said. 'It's a 
lot more loud and crazy, and half of it's in Spanish, half of it's in 
English, and half of it's in Spanglish. But it's really good. There's a 
strange peace amidst the chaos.'

Moving on: The couple returned home (pictured) to new bedrooms, a stocked kitchen 
and Christmas present under the tree, organised by members of their 
church. They are now moving to a larger home

But life is working out well, and most of that is thanks to the children, Lauren 
said. Pictures over Facebook
show them grinning alongside their new siblings and neighbours.

'These kids are fabulous. They have great attitudes,' she said. 'Nobody fought me on going back to school the second day. Everybody was up and ready, showers going on their own. So their attitudes are making the transition a bazillion times easier.'

She added that as they prepare to move into a bigger home, the children's biggest concern is whether they can take the carpet.
