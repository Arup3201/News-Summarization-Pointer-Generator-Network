Topless protesters targeted Italy's former premier Silvio Berlusconi as he went to vote in the country's election - which could plunge Europe into fresh economic chaos.

The three women, thought to be from feminist protest group Femen, burst from a crowd of journalist outside a polling station in Milan and lunged at the controversial politician.

But the demonstrators, who had 'Basta Berlusconi', meaning 'Enough of Berlusconi', written on their bodies, were grabbed by police officers and dragged away before they could reach him.

Italians have gone to the polls in an unpredictable election that looks set to plunge the Eurozone into fresh turmoil.

Polling continues tomorrow amid fears the current administration will have to negotiate with either former premier or a stand-up comedian to retain power.

The results, which will be affected by heavy snow in northern areas, do not look likely to produce a government strong enough to pull the highly indebted country out of its economic slump.

A hung parliament is a distinct possibility, but new elections within months could, many fear, prompt a new dip in confidence in the European Union’s single currency.

Market investors are already nervous about any successor to Mario Monti’s technocratic government being willing to continue his austerity programme and implement necessary reform.

Unsuccessful: The protester were dragged away by police officers and were not able to get the former PM

At the start of the campaign the polls 
were predicting a comfortable victory for the centre left led by 
ex-Communist now moderate Pier Luigi Bersani and his Democratic PD. 
party.

But after a lacklustre campaign by Bersani, the most recent polls suggest that a brazenly populist campaign (including a virtual bribe of a huge tax refund for all) by the three-time PM Berlusconi has clawed him back into contention.

A remarkable come-back from a politician convicted of tax fraud and on trial on a charge of under-age sex with a prostitute.

As ever the mogul, 76, has used his major control of the media to blitz TV and newspaper coverage, and today compared Italian judges to the ‘mafia’.

Meanwhile the prospect of a huge protest vote against the Monti’s government’s painful austerity measures and a never ending series of corruption scandals has thrown the result wide open.

'I'm not confident that the 
government that emerges from the election will be able to solve any of 
our problems,' said Attilio Bianchetti, a 55-year-old builder in Milan, 
who voted for the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.

The
anarchic group led by a stand up comedian turned political activist 
Beppe Grillo has been one of the surprise features of the campaign, 
packing the piazzas of Italy’s cities with hundreds of thousands of 
supporters.

Grillo, 64, (who also has a criminal conviction, for involuntary manslaughter) advocates a new direct democracy which has the main parties scared. The polls suggest he could come as high as second when the votes are counted.

'He’s the only real new element in a political landscape where we’ve been seeing the same faces for too long,’said Vincenzo Cannizzaro, 48, in the Sicialian capital Palermo.

Meanwhile Italians give caretaker PM Monti almost no credit for saving them from the brink of financial ruin 15 months ago.

If opinion polls are converted into votes, his policies of tough medicine will have been rejected by the electorate.

When the last polls closed two weeks ago Bersani was leading at 35 per cent with with Berlusconi 5 points behind,Grillo on 16 and Monti on around 14.

A victory for Berlusconi could be the worst result for the Euro because he has promised to reverse many of the austerity measures brought in by Monti to get interests rates down.

But as seems more likely, with Berlusconi’s resurgence and Grillo’s protest vote, the two comic faces of Italian politics could prevent a Bersani-Monti government from being formed, the only government likely to command international confidence.

For the third-largest Euro economy to be facing economic meltdown could trigger a renewal of the Eurozone crisis just when the worst seemed to be over.

A crisis which would affect a British economy already reeling from the downgrading of its credit rating.
