Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the toy shops, Frozen is back – to the delight of small girls everywhere and the concern of hard-pressed parents.

Disney is releasing a short sequel, Frozen Fever, before Easter and retailers are already preparing for new merchandise.

Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen, Frozen become a global phenomenon when it opened in 2013. 

It won two Oscars (one a Best Original Song award for critically acclaimed hit Let It Go) and overtook Toy Story 3 to be the biggest animation ever.

It raked in more than £820million in worldwide ticket sales, and became a huge money spinner – its merchandise boosted Disney profits by 35 per cent in the final quarter of last year, to £920 million.

Now the seven-minute short is set to boost profits still further.

Frozen Fever has been released alongside, and to help promote, new Disney blockbuster, Cinderella, starring Lily James and Cate Blanchett, and directed by Kenneth Branagh.

The film premieres in America on March 13, and will show in British cinemas from March 27.

Lego has teamed up with Disney to create Elsa’s Sparkling Ice Castle while Mattel has designed new Elsa and Anna dolls. 

Gary Grant, chairman of Dream Toys, which compiles the Toy Retailers’ Association list of must-have toys, said: ‘The popularity of Frozen toys has not waned since Christmas and the Elsa doll remains a top seller.’

Lego has brought out its first Frozen product, Elsa’s Sparkling Ice Castle, which comes complete with mini figurines of Queen Elsa, Princess Anna and snowman Olaf.

The £34.99 Lego construction set, has a secret staircase that can disappear, an ice cream bar and icicle tree, skis, ice skates, capes, a tiara and hair bow, as well as a carrot nose for Olaf.

Toymaker Mattel has four new dolls. 

Its new Elsa, in the shops in August, wears a ‘spring-inspired’ Frozen Fever costume, complete with flower in her hair.

Manufacturer John Adams has created make-your-own £12.99 Disney Frozen Jelly Stickers, and a £14.99 Disney Frozen Blo Pen Activity Set, in which you create spray art by blowing through the barrel of the pen.

Jakks Pacific is bringing out a Sing Along With Elsa Doll, which has a microphone so children can accompany Elsa on Let It Go.

Jakks Pacific’s Ken Goodisson, said: ‘I think Frozen will run and run. You won’t be able to get away from it. It could be another Toy Story, an iconic brand.

‘My children love it. Every second present at Christmas was Frozen related. The kids just can’t let it go!’
