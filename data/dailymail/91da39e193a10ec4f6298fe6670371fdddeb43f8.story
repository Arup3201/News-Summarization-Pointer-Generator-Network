Gazing into the camera, Dana the orang-utan cradles her newborn daughter protectively.

It is a remarkable image, made all the more remarkable by the fact that it would not have existed at all without the pioneering fertility treatment Dana received from an obstetrician whose usual patients are human.

Experts had feared the 25-year-old Sumatran ape, who lives at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in Jersey, would never conceive again.

Bond: Dana cuddles her newborn baby in never-before-seen footage of a Sumatran orangutan giving birth

Look of love: The footage of the birth was taken at Jersey's Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust

She had suffered a stillbirth in 2009, which left her with blocked fallopian tubes.

But Neil MacLachlan, head obstetrician at Jersey General Hospital, was determined to make Dana a mother.

The reproductive system of the orang-utan is very similar to that of a woman, and Mr  MacLachlan had been called in to carry out a caesarean section on one at the trust ten years before.

He volunteered his services for Dana, and over the next few years performed several operations to help clear the blockages.

His treatment – believed to be a world first – resulted in the birth of M3236, as the baby is officially known, on June 9.

See the birth on BBC One Sunday July 14, 3.30pm. Find out more here

In another first, it was filmed for BBC documentary Refugees Of The Lost Rain Forest, using a camera hidden in a wooden box.

After a labour lasting an hour and three quarters, Dana delivered the baby herself, cleared her airways with her mouth and checked her new daughter’s fingers and toes.

Knowing she was being observed by the park’s staff, she went over to her trusted keeper and showed him the baby. She is being referred to temporarily as Harta, which means ‘gift’.

A permanent name will be chosen by a member of the public in a competition.

Infertile: It was believed Dana could not have more children but obstetrician Neil MacLachlan intervened and she gave birth to the adorable infant this year 

Mr MacLachlan, 57, said: ‘The reproductive organs of an orang-utan and a human are virtually identical. You’d be hard pushed  to tell the difference at all. An orang-utan’s fallopian tubes are slightly shorter.’ He added: ‘It was fantastic we were able to help Dana get pregnant.

‘We were worried throughout her pregnancy because of her previous stillbirth and regularly monitored her using ultrasound, but luckily it all went extremely well.’

A spokesman for the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust said: ‘The baby is big and strong and healthy – very awake and alert.

‘Dana is a great mother. We see it as a miracle.’

Refugees Of The Lost Rain Forest will be broadcast on BBC One South West on July 14, but will also be available on BBC iPlayer.
