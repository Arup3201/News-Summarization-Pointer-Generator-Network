Adults who watched a lot of television when they were children are more likely to be overweight, new research has found.

For every extra hour a child spends watching TV each day, their weight in adulthood increases by about half a pound.

The researchers believe this could be 
because when children are watching television their hands are free so 
they are able to eat whatever they want - meaning they form bad habits.

‘The weight of the evidence is pretty strong that television viewing is related to unhealthy changes in weight among youth,’ Jennifer Falbe, who led the research at the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston, said.

She added: ‘It's important for parents to be aware of all the potentially obesogenic screens that they should really be limiting in their children's lives.’

The researchers used data from a long-term study of children who filled in surveys every other year.

The surveys included questions about their height and weight as well as how much time they spent watching TV and playing computer games.

Out of about 4,300 girls in the study, 17 per cent were overweight or obese. Of the 3,500 boys, 24 per cent were above a healthy weight.

From one survey to the next, each one-hour increase in children's daily TV watching was tied to an increase of about 0.1 points on the body mass index (BMI) scale.

Dr Mark Tremblay, director of Healthy Active Living and Obesity Research at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute in Ottawa, Canada, told Reuters Health: ‘[When children watch TV] there is more purposeful, deliberate exposure to eating options, commercials that come on that might cue you to go off to the pantry and grab a cookie or a soft drink.

‘Typically your hands are free when you're watching TV, so should that temptation capture you, you're able to sit there and munch on whether it's a healthy or an unhealthy snack.’

Dr Tremblay, who was not involved in the study, added that even playing computer games could be better than watching TV as it makes children a little bit more active and distracted from eating.

Many parents believe their children are getting a reasonable amount of recreational screen time, Dr Tremblay said.

But he added that most U.S. and Canadian children exceed the recommended two-hour maximum per day.

‘We don't pay attention to the fact that it's half an hour here, half an hour there, an hour here, an hour there,’ Dr Tremblay said.

Could be because when people are watching TV their hands are unoccupied, so they get into the habit of mindless and unnecessary eating, say experts
