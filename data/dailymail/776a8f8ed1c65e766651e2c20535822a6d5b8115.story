Suspicions: Head football coach Todd Hoffner, 46, was arrested on allegations that he had possessed and produced child pornography

The head football coach at Minnesota State University was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of owning and producing child pornography.

Todd Hoffner, 46, was in custody on suspicion of using underage people in a sexual performance and possession of child pornography, Blue Earth County Sheriff's Capt Rich Murry told the Mankato Free Press.

Hoffner
 was escorted off the football practice field on Friday and has been on 
leave from his coaching position since then.

After an investigation and a search of his home, he was arrested last night.

Hoffner, who is married with three children, had not been formally charged by Tuesday evening, and it was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney. 

He remained in jail on suspicion of 'use of minors in a sexual performance' while authorities considered formal charges.

Spokesman Dan Benson added that a university investigation is pending.

'The University's top priority is ensuring the safety and well-being of its students, program participants, and the community.

'The
 University is not aware of any allegations affecting university 
students or program participants,' Benson said in the statement.

Assistant coach Aaron Keen told the Star Tribune: 'The whole situation comes as a shock and is still a shock.'

He added that the players were 'responding well' since news surfaced.

Detectives remained at Hoffner’s house 
for more than an hour after his arrest. A vehicle at the house was towed
 from the scene and other evidence was confiscated.

Hoffner is in his fifth year as Minnesota State's head football coach.

He led the team to the playoffs in 2008 and 2009, and a share of the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference title in 2011.

He was named NSIC coach of the year in 2009 and was previously the offensive coordinator at the University of South Dakota.

A spokeswoman at the university told the Mankato Free Press that Hoffner earns an annual salary of $101,000 along with fringe benefits worth $31,000.

His contract was renewed on July 1 for four years.

Two complaints have been filed against him since he has been with 
the university, according to the spokeswoman. Details have not been disclosed.
