Cheeky monkeys got into the spirit of Halloween early as they gave each other a playful fright messing around with masks and disguises at a Bedfordshire safari park.

Ring-tailed lemurs had fun scaring their friends with ghoulish Frankenstein and vampire masks.

Meanwhile a brave Patas monkey proves he’s not scared of monsters by eagerly tucking into this sorrowful jack-o-lantern pumpkin.

Park spokeswoman Abi Crowley says the Halloween fun went down a treat at Woburn Safari Park, which is close to Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.

She added: 'All the lemurs and monkeys were running around teasing each other with the masks.As the lemurs held the masks up to eat they looked like they were trying to spook each other out.

'And the sad face carved on the pumpkin was priceless as one of our monkeys munched straight into it.

Despite some of the animals getting spooked by the Halloween paraphernalia, others got to grips with pumpkins and Jack o' lanterns

'They are usually fed a lot of cabbage, carrots, tomatoes and squash so this was a nice treat.'

Staff at Woburn put mashed banana on the back of the Halloween masks to tempt the lemurs, who live in a ‘walk-through’ section of the park.

Ring-tailed and red fronted lemurs can even be seen sticking their heads into pumpkins dangling from climbing ropes to steal the yummy snacks inside.

Ms Crowley said: 'A lot of our visitors stopped to have a good look and enjoyed watching the animals’ antics.'
