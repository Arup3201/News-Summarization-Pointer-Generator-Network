A former Knox Grammar teacher and convicted sex offender who took the stand on Tuesday at the royal commission into child sexual abuse said he was not fired when the school learned of his abuse.

Craig Treloar, a former teacher at the elite boy's school, told the inquest he expected to be fired when he was caught, but was instead shown leniency, the ABC reported. 

He engaged in sexual abuse with young male students at the school, as well as showing them pornographic images with some depicting bestiality.

Treloar - who was convicted on a number of charges including sexual abuse in 2010 -  told the commission he expected to be sacked by the then principal Dr Ian Paterson after he admitted to showing students porn in 1987, but he was not reprimanded.

Craig Treloar, a former teacher and convicted sex offender told an inquest on Tuesday he was not fired as he though he would be when he confessed to showing students pornography in 1987

'I thought my career was over,' he told the hearing.

'I thought I'd be sacked.'

'The decision was that obviously I would leave the boarding house, that I would lose my teaching position for a period of six months,' Treloar said.

But according to the former teacher he was never asked about the extent of the abuse, and after being told he was to lose his paid teaching position for a period, did not even have to serve that time immediately.

There was no mention of either an internal inquiry or involving the police.

The hearing continues. 

Former Knox Grammar School student Scott Ashton, told a royal commission hearing investigating how the Uniting Church and the private school responded to child abuse allegations, that he was left deeply confused by the tribute to the late Bruce Barrett

Earlier this week the inquiry was told the prestigious Sydney school erected memorial gates for a teacher who was known to be a 'notorious molester' with the inscription 'he touched us all'.

Former Knox Grammar School student Scott Ashton, 44, told a royal commission hearing investigating how the Uniting Church and the private school responded to child abuse allegations, that he was left deeply confused by the tribute to the late Bruce Barrett.

Mr Ashton called the art teacher a 'notorious molester' while giving evidence to the commission on Tuesday, as he revealed the abuse he had personally suffered at Barrett's hands in the Wahroonga school's classrooms on Sydney's North Shore. 

In his statement, read out by close friend Gretel Pinniger who is also known as the high profile Sydney dominatrix Madame Lash, Mr Ashton said Barrett would chase and tickle his students.

He told the inquiry that Barrett would occasionally wear a red tie, announcing 'watch out boys, it's a red tie day' to signify someone would be caned that day.

On one occasion, he recalled being chased by the teacher who then requested he stay back after class. Fearing that he would be caned, Mr Ashton was instead sexually assaulted.

'I felt ashamed of my abuse. I was deeply ashamed and unable to discuss it with anyone,' Mr Ashton said in his statement, according to News Corp.

'It was an issue which I avoided because any reminder of it would cause me severe stress and interfered with my ability to function and cope on a day-to-day basis.'

Despite his notoriety, Mr Ashton said everyone at the school was expected to pay tribute to Barrett, who had died young.

'The fact that he was so well regarded by the school despite being a notorious molester made me feel very confused and powerless,' he said.

Mr Ashton said he was nine when he went to Knox and from the start he was abused 'openly and brazenly' by another teacher, Barrie Stewart.

He said the sexual abuse he suffered led him to become a teenage sex worker, according to the ABC.

He described another incident in which he was inappropriately touched in sight of other staff and students in the playground, saying: 'It was so common I wasn't sure it was wrong for teachers to touch me like that.' 

In 2009, Stewart was convicted of five counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault. He was given a suspended sentence. 

Five former teachers have been convicted of sexual assault, however the inquiry has heard allegations against a further three staff members who have never been charged.
