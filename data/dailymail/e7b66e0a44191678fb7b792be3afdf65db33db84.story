Mario Balotelli could have signed for Paris Saint-Germain after his impressive performances at Euro 2012 - but Carlo Ancelotti plumped for Zlatan Ibrahimovic to be 'on the safe side'.

Ancelotti, now at Real Madrid and an opponent of Balotelli and his Liverpool team in the Champions League, believes that once the Italy striker feels settled at Anfield, he will prove to be a good signing.

'I was trying to (sign him) at Paris Saint-Germain. He was coming off the back of an impressive European Championship,' Ancelotti said to La Repubblica.

'Then the opportunity for Ibrahimovic presented itself and we went more on the safe side.'

Balotelli is yet to score for Liverpool since his August transfer to the club from AC Milan, but Ancelotti does not doubt that he will succeed, albeit in his own time.

'He has to find a place to feel at ease. Sooner or later he will succeed, but it depends on him - heaven helps those who help themselves,' he said.
