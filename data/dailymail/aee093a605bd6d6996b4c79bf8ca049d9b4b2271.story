From 6ft supermodel Grace Jones redefining the meaning of the word 'fierce' in shoulder-pads and stilettos to Adam Ant's embrace of the New Romantic, the 80s had no shortage of iconic fashion moments.

But of all the striking images documenting the decade's ultra-stylish beau monde, few are as beautiful as those produced by fashion illustrator, Tony Viramontes.

Although Viramontes, who first came to prominence in the late 1970s, didn't live to see the end of the decade, his wonderful illustrations have gained a cult following among fashion fans for whom Christian Lacroix is still the only designer worth wearing.

His work wasn't all Lacroix though. Other designers whose work was translated into his trademark sharp lines and vivid colours included Yves Saint Laurent, Versace, Chanel and Valentino, and he also created a portfolio of portraits with subjects ranging from Paloma Picasso to Duran Duran.

'Fashion, art and life were indistinguishable to Viramontes,' writes author Dean Rhys Morgan in his new book about the illustrator, Bold, Beautiful And Damned: The World Of 1980s Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes.

'His aesthetic went far beyond his drawings and he became a great commercial fashion illustrator.

'His work captured movement in fleeting moments – the way a woman might throw her coat over her shoulders, hold a cigarette or cross her legs – small gestures that can make clothes and the women wearing them all the more memorable.'

In the Bold, Beautiful And Damned, page after page shows smoky-eyed women, swan-necked and crimson-lipped, an oddly haunting record of a decade that style was rumoured to have forgotten.

Most spectacular of all, though, are the illustrations that deal with Paris couture - then enjoying a particularly opulent moment - and a passion of Viramontes.

He embraced it gluttonously, says Rhys Morgan, who adds:

'The flamboyance of the moment was a perfect fit for his vocation: fashion swung his way as the hard outlines, bold colours and overt glamour all lent themselves to his pen and paintbrush.'

Tragically, Viramontes wasn't given much time to pursue his love of couture, dying in 1988 at the age of just 31.

Despite Viramontes' untimely death, his wonderful illustrations remain and offer a glimpse of the glamorous side of a decade much maligned today.

In this exclusive extract from Bold, Beautiful and Damned: The World of 1980s Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes, author Dean Rhys Morgan reveals how a meeting with couturier Valentino left Viramontes inspired...

By 1984 the fashion world had well and 
truly caught on, Viramontes attained a fashion nirvana when, after an
introduction by fashion editor Franca Sozzani, he was summoned to Rome 
by the couturier Valentino Garavani to create a portfolio of drawings 
that were to mark his silver jubilee celebrations in the pages of Vogue 
Italia.

Sozzani recalls that 'while people have always perceived 
Valentino to be very classical, Giancarlo Giammetti [the couturier’s 
business partner] was always looking for young and avant-garde people to
work with' to keep the brand current and relevant.

'Haute couture at 
the time was perceived to be rather staid,' remembers Tony’s agent 
Eugenia Melian.

But he was able to give Garavani’s ruffles a new twist: 'Viramontes made Valentino very modern,' says Giammetti, 'and that was 
very important. I thought that fashion illustrated by an artist would be
very eye-catching and new. It evokes a dream, we sell dreams and 
romance [and] Tony knew how to do it with a few strokes.'

The 
intricacies of Valentino’s gowns inspired Viramontes to create some of 
his most defiantly high-fashion images. 'The clothes were so complex to 
draw, it was almost like an exercise,' remembers model Lisabeth Garber.

'Tony’s sketches were intuitive, right out of the hand.' 'He was quite 
free,' concurs Giammetti, 'he worked very quickly and if something did 
not work for me, he would redo it immediately.'
