Concern: Experts warn that rates of the illness are reaching 'epidemic' levels largely due to rising rates of obesity (file picture)

More than a quarter of patients taken to hospital for heart failure now have diabetes, a report reveals today.

Experts warn that rates of the illness are reaching ‘epidemic’ levels largely due to rising rates of obesity.

The NHS report show that diabetes sufferers are a third more likely to die from any cause within the next 12 months than all other patients.

Heart failure occurs when the organ is too weak to pump blood around the body at the right pressure causing breathlessness and fatigue.

It affects 750,000 Britons and around three quarters die within five years of being diagnosed, usually when the heart eventually stops pumping.

Diabetes patients are far more prone as they tend to have higher high blood pressure and high cholesterol which both put extra strain on the heart.

The report by the Health and Social Care Information Centre - which looked at the records of two million patients - estimates that 24,900 sufferers may have died too early last year.

Dr Bob Young, from the HSCIC said: ‘This audit is a wake-up call. Heart failure is preventable and treatable.

Every health professional should take note of how much more common heart failure is among patients with diabetes and how high the short term risk of death is.’

Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: ‘The finding that every fourth person admitted to hospital with heart failure has diabetes is a stark illustration of how we are facing an epidemic of diabetes-related complications.

‘We hope this report is a spur to action for both the NHS and people with diabetes. Given how much higher their risk is, it is vital that people with diabetes have their blood pressure and cholesterol checked at least once a year and that if they are high then they are supported in lowering them.’
