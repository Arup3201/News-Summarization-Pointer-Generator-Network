Police have charged a Bronx man in connection with the grisly death of a Bronx man shoved in front of a subway train Sunday.

Police announced Tuesday evening that Kevin Darden, 34, was apprehended at approximately 6 p.m. and hours later was formally charged with the murder of 61-year-old Wai Kuen Kwok.

According to police, on Nov. 6 in a separate incident Darden also 'pushed a 51 year old male to the ground causing an injury to the victims hand and back. The victim was transported to NYU Medical Center where he was treated and released.' 

61-year-old Wai Kuen Kwok, who was found 'unconscious and unresponsive' on the tracks after being forced in front of an incoming southbound D train, this Sunday, according to police reports.

The New York Times reports that Darden is in fact homeless having not lived in his last know address for three months, according to a woman who identified herself as his mother.

Chief of detectives Robert K. Boyce praised detectives on Twitter for their work in the case.

Darden's former landlord said he has a brother in East Texas. 

Darden was also arrested there in in 2011 after allegedly pouring gasoline over his brother's home in an arson attempt. That case did not go forward to trial.

Darden allegedly fled the scene of the fatal subway attack before authorities could arrive.

CBS New York reported Monday night that police were close to an arrest, after spreading images of him caught on security footage.

Darden has more than 30 prior arrests on his record including charges for robbery, assault, and drugs. 

He was last arrested on Sunday, Nov. 9, after allegedly pickpocketing someone in Manhattan. 

Kwok was reportedly with his wife waiting on the train at 8:45 a.m. Sunday when he was shoved onto the tracks at the station on 167th Street and Grand Concourse.

The couple were going to Chinatown for breakfast to celebrate his wife's birthday. 

There was no fight between Kwok and his assailant leading to the push, and police were unable to ascertain a motive.

His visibly shaken widow can be seen in surveillance footage as she's taken to an ambulance and sent to a local hospital to be treated for shock. 

As of Monday she was still recovering, CBS New York reported. 

Darden was also caught on camera.

He was seen not long after the deadly attack boarding a BX35 bus, then exiting a few moments later to go into a bodega. 

He left the store smoking a cigarette.

'It’s crazy how sick some people are to just shove someone onto the track, kill someone and then just go on with their day like nothing happened,' local resident Allen Sneed told reporters.

On Monday, police announced a $20,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. 

Police safety experts recommended standing against the subway wall and staying aware of your surroundings by not using electronic devices while waiting for your train.
