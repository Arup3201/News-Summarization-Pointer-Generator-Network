An investment bank may pay staff their bonuses early in order to avoid extra taxes that Labour have pledged to bring in, it was reported last night.

Rothschild is believed to be considering the move after Ed Balls promised to introduce a windfall tax on bankers' bonuses in the first year of the next parliament if Labour comes to power.

The shadow chancellor has threatened to repeat the move – which Labour say will raise up to £2billion – the following year if bankers do not show more restraint on pay.

Rothschild would normally pay its staff their bonus relating to performance for 2014 in June this year.

But two people familiar with the bank's thinking have revealed the bank is considering bringing the pay-out forward to before the next general election, according to the Financial Times. The bank has officially declined to comment.

In a statement, it said: 'Rothschild annually distributes a percentage of its profits for the year to its staff as a profit share.

'The payment date of this distribution varies across divisions and geographies.'

Under the Labour plan, bonuses paid to bankers would be taxed to fund the party's compulsory jobs gua5rantee to get young people into work.

Mr Balls said last year: 'After the global banking crisis and with bank bonuses soaring again this year, it's fair to pay for our jobs plan with a repeat of Labour's tax on bank bonuses. We need a recovery for the many, not just a few at the top.'

It comes after it was revealed this weekend that high street banks are to pay out bonuses worth more than £5billion - with the chief executives in line for millions of pounds next week.

Stuart Gulliver, HSBC's chief executive, is in line for pay and perks of £7.4million, including a bonus of £1.3million.

Despite the recent string of scandals - including tax avoidance at its Swiss private banking arm – it is preparing to reward its top staff with a total bonus pool of £2.2billion.

From 2015, banks across the European Union now face tougher constraints on bonuses paid out to senior staff and key risk-takers.

These employees at Rothschild – called 'code staff' – shared bonuses of £12million between 50 of them between 2013 and 2014.

A final decision on the timing of bonuses is expected to be taken before the Rothschild group's year end on March 31.
