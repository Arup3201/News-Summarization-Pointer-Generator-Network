Ask Rio Ferdinand who the next England manager should be and he will tell you that the search should start and end with Glenn Hoddle.

Nearly 16 years have passed since Hoddle’s last game as England’s head coach, a 2-0 win over the Czech Republic at Wembley in a friendly in November 1998.

On Tuesday the pair were reunited when Hoddle accepted a bolt-from-the-blue offer to become Harry Redknapp’s first team coach at QPR.

Bolt from the blue: Glenn Hoddle accepted the offer to become Harry Redknapp's first-team coach at QPR

Redknapp wants to play the in-vogue 3-5-2 formation, casting Ferdinand in the role of sweeper and using Clint Hill and Steven Caulker to stabilise his defence.

If it works - and safety in the Barclays Premier League will be the measure of its success - then you can expect some momentum for Hoddle’s return to the national team. Football really is that fickle.

This is a fascinating appointment because Hoddle - as a man and as a manager - divides opinion. He is not an easy man to get along with.

His last coaching appointment was in 2004, an unsuccessful spell at Wolves that lasted less than two years. He has been off the training field a long time now.

‘The game has moved on since the last time Glenn was a manager,’ was Tim Sherwood response to Hoddle’s criticism of his Tottenham team from the television studio last season.

They have never seen eye-to-eye, a legacy from Hoddle’s spell as Spurs manager when Sherwood’s playing days were coming to an end. Sherwood is not alone in his assessment.

With the national team, Hoddle made some catastrophic decisions as head coach. One of them, over his comments about the after-life, led to his resignation in February 1999.

Those with even deeper memories will recall his book - Glenn Hoddle: My World Cup story - spilling the guts on England’s dressing room secrets at France 98. As a result, he lost the trust of his players.

More recently Gary Neville, who is now England’s assistant manager, questioned his methods and ability to manage a dressing room in his own autobiography, RED.

According to Neville, England’s head coach used to touch players on the heart in the dressing room before matches and asked the backroom team to walk around the pitch ‘anti-clockwise’ when they played Argentina at France 98 to create positive energy. Sounds bonkers.

Neville, though, does go on to say that Hoddle ‘undoubtedly’ wanted England to play the right way but questioned whether that he had ‘the man-management skills to go with his football intelligence’.

Society demands a second chance, an opportunity to rectify mistakes from the past. This, unquestionably, is Hoddle’s.

Ferdinand, who played in Hoddle’s last game as England’s head coach, believes he possesses one of the finest tactical minds in the game.

Long spell out: Hoddle has not coached in English football since his tenure at Wolves ended in 2006

That is a select grouping, one that includes some coaching greats such as Rinus Michel, Miguel Munoz and Bob Paisley.

The former Manchester United defender, who played and trained under Terry Venables, Kevin Keegan, Sven Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren and Fabio Capello with the national team, is convinced Hoddle belongs in the elite category.

On the training field, Ferdinand will tell you that Hoddle has an eye for detail and the intuition to solve problems before his players have even seen them. If true, that is a unique skill.

In the Louis van Gaal era, we are witnessing a massive change in the landscape of English football.

There is endless talk about tactics, systems and team shape now that the fabled Dutch coach has arrived at Manchester United with his salt and pepper pots.

Sweeping statement: Ferdinand will be the 'libero' at QPR, as Hoddle (right) was at Swindon

New era: Louis van Gaal is using the same 3-5-2 formation Hoddle and Redknapp will attempt to implement at QPR

It is there, at Old Trafford, where van Gaal intends to play a variation of 3-5-2 this season. Redknapp wants to do the same.

Hoddle didn’t reinvent the wheel when he became manager of Swindon in 1991, his first coaching appointment, but it was certainly brave to play with a libero in the old Second Division.

He put himself there, the launchpad for Swindon’s attacks as they progressed to the play-off final, where he scored the opening goal in a 4-3 victory over Leicester, in his second full season.

Paul Bodin, Colin Calderwood, John Moncur and former Tottenham midfielder Micky Hazard, who came on as a substitute at Wembley, were in the victorious Swindon team.

He went on to sign the great Ruud Gullit in 1995 when  manager of Chelsea, converting the former AC Milan forward into a libero, with mixed results, towards the end of his career.

It is 21 years since he started work at Chelsea’s old Harlington training centre after succeeding Dave Webb as their manager.

Now he is returning to work there, this time as QPR’s first team coach as he attempts to rebuild his career at the very highest level.

At the age of 56 there is time for Hoddle to make an impression and fulfil the ambition he once showed as a promising young coach.

If it works out, it will only be a matter of time before he becomes an option for the national team.
