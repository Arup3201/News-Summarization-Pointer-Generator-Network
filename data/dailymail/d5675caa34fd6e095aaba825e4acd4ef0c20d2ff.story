Microsoft's Bing has often played second fiddle to Google, but at the Oscars, it shone - correctly predicting 20 of the 24 results.

Bing successfully predicted best picture, best director, best actor, best actress, and the results for supporting actor and actress.

Even the four predictions it got wrong were its second choice predictions.

Microsoft's scorecard: Only four predictions were wrong out of the 24 made by the Bing prediction system.

Microsoft says its predictions are based on a 'several attributes beyond accuracy, including flexibility, scalability, and timeliness.'

The key was to find people skilled at predictions. 

'Prediction markets follow a select group of people who have high levels of information on what voters will do and are willing to wager real-money on the outcomes,' the firm said. 

'Perfectly calibrated 20 of 24 (w/ 4 2nd place winners),' said David Rothschild, who leads Microsoft's New York team.

Ahead of the Oscars Microsoft shared its latest predictions, claiming that most of the awards are 'relatively unpredictable.'

Microsoft uses a prediction model for the Oscars managed by  Rothschild  at the company's New York City research lab.

He correctly predicted 21 of 24 Oscar winners last year, and 19 of 24 winners in 2013.

This year, he said, said that many of the categories were influenced by films not nominated.

Before the ceremony, many online comments were objecting to the lack of nominations for 'Selma,' and, on a light-hearted note, incredulity about 'The Lego Movie' not receiving an Animated Feature Film nomination.

Rothschild said that doesn't mean the un-nominated can't affect the Oscar winners in those 'disputed' categories. 'Absence in the category makes a difference in the distribution of votes for the remaining choices,' he said. 

'As this controversy ebbed and flowed over the last few weeks, we had to make sure to take into account how it may affect the final votes,' he said. 

'Whenever I create predictions I focus on several attributes beyond accuracy, including flexibility, scalability, and timeliness,' Rothschild said.

However, he admitted that the pubic can't always be trusted. 

'One way to take this into account is to follow the public opinion on the topic and assume that public opinion will translate into pressure on the voters.

'However, public opinion is only loosely related to winners in the Oscars, because the sentiment and expectations of the general public is closely tied to name recognition and popularity.'

A night full of stars: The Koda Theatre in LA was filled to the brim with Hollywood's leading actors 

The man who predicted the Oscars: David Rothschild, who leads Microsoft's New York team. 

Rothschild says it's also difficult to match public opinion to a specific category.

'There are not even many alternatives to express dissatisfaction in the nomination process in that there is no clear movie for people to support in lieu of Selma's lack of nominations.'

The key was to find people skilled at predictions. 

'Prediction markets follow a select group of people who have high levels of information on what voters will do and are willing to wager real-money on the outcomes,' he says. 

'And, prediction market-based forecasts have been incredibly accurate,' hence the aforementioned successful predictions of previous years' Oscar winners. 

'Had you asked me about the likely winners in the top six categories last week, two of them would have been different,' Rothschild admitted. 

The winners of the 87th Annual Academy Awards were announced in Los Angeles on Sunday evening.

Continuing his clean sweep of awards season, emotional Eddie Redmayne was almost too choked to speak as he picked up Best Actor for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.

'Thank you – I don't I'm capable of articulating quite how I feel right now but please know this – I am fully aware of that I am lucky, lucky man,' he began, clutching his trophy.

'This Oscar – wow! –this Oscar, this belongs to all of those people around the world, battling ALS,' he added staring at the statuette in disbelief.

Meanwhile, it might not have swept the board completely, but Birdman still flew home with the Oscar for Best Picture on the night.

The comedy drama swooped off with a total of four awards on Sunday night - a number that tied with The Grand Budapest Hotel - including Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.

Overcome: British actor Eddie Redmayne, 33, gave an emotional speech as he was named Best Actor for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything - a win predicted by Microsoft.

Elegant as ever: The 54-year-old beauty wore her hair in a sleek updo and set off the look with a pair of sparkly drop earrings 

The 87th annual ceremony favoured niche movies instead of big box office hits, with films including American Sniper and Wild missing out on the top prizes.

However, Birdman's lead actor Michael Keaton was beaten to his Best Actor by Eddie. 

Backstage, 33-year-old Eddie revealed that winning was like a 'weird and wild dream'.

There were no surprises when it came to the actresses, with favourites Julianne Moore winning for Best Actress for Still Alice, and Patricia Arquette winning for Boyhood.

Julianne became emotional when she revealed for the first time that her husband Bart Freundlich predicted she would win the Oscar.

'I've never told anyone this... but [my husband] was the first person to see the film.

'He was crying and I was like what's going on?' she said.

'When we walked out he said you're going to win an Oscar and I said 'Like come on!'.

The other big winner of the night was Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel, taking home four awards in total.

The energetic evening saw Oscar host Neil Patrick Harris put on a theatrical performance at the Kodak theatre.

Neil, 41, only managed a few jokes before bringing out his jazz hands, performing a hilarious original song - Moving Pictures - about the great and good of Hollywood. 

Neil's spirited routine - where he was joined by Anna Kendrick and Jack Black - paid tribute to some of Hollywood's best known performances and scenes, and had the star-studded audience.

Taking home the first of award of the night was J.K. Simmons for Whiplash - a perhaps unsurprising win considering he has swept the board in the same category this awards season.
