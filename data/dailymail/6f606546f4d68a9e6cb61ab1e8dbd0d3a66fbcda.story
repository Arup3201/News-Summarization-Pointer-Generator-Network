Tim Sherwood has been sacked as Tottenham Hotspur manager after just six months in charge at White Hart Lane.

Sherwood took over from Andre Villas-Boas in December on an 18-month deal, but has failed to reach his second season at the club, who have exercised a break clause in the contract.

Gone: Tim Sherwood has been sacked as Tottenham manager after six months in charge

Out the door: Levy (centre) has decided to trigger a break clause in Sherwood's contract

Speculation over Sherwood's future was
 rife last month, and chairman Daniel Levy has finally decided to find a
 more suited man to bring the club forward.

Sherwood
 won 14 games of his 28 in charge, drawing four and losing 10. Spurs 
finished in sixth in the table, 10 points off fourth place.

The
 45-year-old could be offered an immediate return to management by 
Championship club Brighton.

Sherwood, who has been installed as 
the bookies' favourite for the vacant head coach role at The Amex, told Sky Sports News how upset he was to 
have lost his job at White Hart Lane.

'It is obviously a massive wrench to leave a club of the stature of Tottenham Hotspur, a club very close to my heart,' he said.

Levy said on the club's website: 'We appointed Tim mid-season as someone who knew both the players and the club.

Gary Lineker's reaction to Tim Sherwood's sacking

'We agreed an 18-month contract with a break clause at the end of the season and we have now exercised that option.

'Since
 appointing Tim as assistant first team coach in 2008 and then as 
technical co-ordinator in 2010 and head of football development in 2012,
 we have been supportive of him 
during football management changes throughout that period. 

'On
 behalf of the club, I should like to state our thanks for all his 
efforts during his years with us. We wish him great success in his 
managerial career.

'Moving
 forward, now the season is over, we shall embark on the process of 
finding a new head coach. We have a talented squad and exciting young 
players coming through.

'We
 need to build on this season, develop our potential and inspire the 
kind of performances that we associate with our great club.'

Record: Spurs did enjoy some success under Sherwood, winning 14 of his 28 games in charge

Having never managed at the top level before, Sherwood was initially installed as interim replacement for Villas-Boas, with a Capital One Cup exit to local rivals West Ham his first game in charge.

A 5-1 home defeat to eventual champions Manchester City and a 4-0 thrashing at Chelsea saw Sherwood question the commitment of a number of his players.

He always claimed the uncertainty over his position was making the job harder and, as the season drew to a close, even his players started suggesting Sherwood's tenure was coming to an end.

Midfielder Sandro, who had fallen out of favour under Sherwood, told ESPN Brazil he was expecting a new man to be in charge at the start of the new campaign and now he has been proven correct.

High point: Sherwood won his first match in charge, a 3-2 win at Southampton in December

Reports surfaced at the end of April 
that Levy had been in contact with Ajax to enquire about the 
availability of De Boer, but Southampton boss Pochettino is the 
favourite to take charge at White Hart Lane, with initial front-runner 
Van Gaal appearing set to be installed as Manchester United's new 
manager.

Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino 
is thought to be on Levy's list to replace Sherwood, while Napoli and 
former Chelsea manager Rafa Benitez has also been linked.
