Shamed multi-millionaire art mogul Charles Saatchi made a show of defiance last night when he dined alone at the central London restaurant where he was photographed grabbing wife Nigella Lawson by the throat less than ten days ago.

Life appears to be going on as normal for Mr Saatchi, 70, who was seen speaking on his phone and smoking as he sat outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair.

Mr Saatchi, who is said to have dined alone, had earlier reiterated his claims that he was only involved in a 'playful tiff' with his TV chef wife while sat outside the same restaurant earlier this month.

He was photographed on that occasion repeatedly squeezing his wife's throat and pinching her nose.

Defiance: Last night Charles Saatchi was again at Scott's restaurant alone, despite it being where he assaulted his wife

Return: Saatchi pictured leaving Scott's on his own last night after dining at the Mayfair restaurant

Night out: The art mogul was not believed to be dining with anyone else during his visit to Scott's

Hours after Mr Saatchi was spotted dining alone, Ms Lawson's father, former Chancellor Nigel Lawson, was pictured arriving at her Mayfair bolthole to offer his support.

Nigella has fled to a £10,000-a-week central London apartment to decide whether her marriage to Charles Saatchi has a future after he assaulted her. 

Wearing a smart suit, Tory Lord Lawson did not speak to press as he entered the flat this morning.

He may have been reacting to news that his chef daughter could fly out to America soon in an attempt to escape the media spotlight surrounding her controversial marriage

Visit: Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson arrived at his daughter's flat in a smart suit before being buzzed in

Plans: Nigella Lawson could soon fly out to America in an attempt to escape the media spotlight surrounding her marriage to Charles Saatchi. She is pictured today returning to her Mayfair address

Space: Ms Lawson is due to rent a house in LA during filming for the second series of U.S show The Taste. The taxi driver is pictured letting her out of the vehicle

Ms Lawson's plans to move out to America earlier than expected came as Mr Saatchi said he was only attempting to wipe his wife's nose and called the 27 minute incident a 'playful tiff'.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, he 
said yesterday: 'Even domestic goddesses sometimes have a bit of snot in their 
nose. I was trying to fish it out'.

The advertising mogul has apparently been carrying on life as normal since the incident - last night he was seen dining at Scott's, the Mayfair restaurant where the row with his wife took place.

Ms Lawson is due to fly to LA this summer as she films a second series of U.S show The Taste. While there she plans to rent a house in LA .

Speaking to the Evening Standard, a Los Angeles TV source said: 'Going to America may give Nigella the space from her husband to help find a way to repairing the damage that has been done.'

The show is a food version of hit BBC show The Voice and is aired by U.S network ABC.

In
the reality contest, Ms Lawson and other judges rule on food with blind
single-spoon tastings. The show co-stars US chef and author Anthony 
Bourdain.

The initial photographs appeared to show the 70-year-old former advertising tycoon grabbing 
his wife by the throat caused a furore when published a week ago.

Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault.

Under pressure: Charles Saatchi is pictured today outside a restaurant from where he bought food

On the side: Mr Saatchi went in through a side door next to the restaurant where food was delivered to him

Explanation: Ms Lawson's plans to move out to America earlier than expected came as Mr Saatchi today said he was attempting to wipe his wife's nose

TV
chef Miss Lawson, 53, apparently carried on with married life as normal
after the incident.

But as soon as the pictures were published she left
the £14million family home in Chelsea to live in a £10,000-a-week 
apartment in Mayfair.

She 
was seen outside on Wednesday and Friday without her wedding ring.

On 
Saturday a bulging bag of clothes was delivered, leading to speculation 
that she is settling in for a long stay.

Miss
Lawson has two children from her first marriage to journalist John 
Diamond who died from throat cancer in 2001. She and Saatchi married ten
years ago.

Yesterday her spokesman said she was maintaining her silence on her marriage difficulties.
