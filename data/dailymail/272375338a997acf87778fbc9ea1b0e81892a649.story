Snowboarder Vic Wild, a native of Wild Salmon, Washington, took home two gold medals in Sochi this week – only he did it for Russia rather than Team USA.

American by birth, Russian by marriage and by choice, Wild completed a historic sweep of the Olympic snowboard parallel slalom events to give his adopted country a boost in the race to top the medals table.

Wild edged Zan Kosir of Slovenia by 0.11 seconds in Saturday's parallel slalom final to win his second gold medal of the games.

The victory capped a remarkable four days for the guy from White Salmon, who is married to Russian snowboarder Alena Zavarzina and earlier won gold in parallel giant slalom.

Wild’s Wednesday triumph was all the sweeter since he took home his first gold medal just minutes after his better half won a bronze. 

Zavarzina was unable to see his run and had to check with the media before discovering that there was an Olympic champion in the family.

‘He deserves it, he's worked so hard,’ she said. ‘He's so far from his home town and he had to switch countries.

‘He has to deal with the Russian mentality, with stuff he's not used to, working with people who don't understand him most of the time. ‘I'm very happy. I'm going to cry right now.’

As the Beach Boys’ hit ‘Good Vibrations’ played over the loud speakers following his win over Swiss Nevin Galmarini, Wild wrapped himself in a Russian flag handed to him by Zavarzina.

Different red white, and blue: Frustrated by what he saw as a lack of funding from the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Association, Wild praised his adoptive country for giving him a chance to win medals

‘It's incredible to win it along with Alena, for us to both have success on the same day is truly incredible,’ Wild told reporters.

‘I don't know how this happened, it's too good to be true, I might wake up soon. It feels like a dream.’Wild added, ‘I'm so stoked to win it for Russia, those people out there were rooting so hard, it feels awesome.’

The 27-year-old narrowly escaped the semifinals in Saturday's parallel slalom. He lost an edge in the first heat and trailed Benjamin Karl of Austria by 1.12 seconds heading into the deciding race.

Wild somehow made up the difference during a frantic sprint down Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, stretching his hand across the finish line first to win by inches.

The final wasn't drama-free either. Wild took a .12 lead over Kosir - who earned bronze in the PGS - after the first run and held the Slovenian snowboarder at bay in the final. Wild thrust his arms into the air in triumph while the decidedly pro-Russian crowd chanted ‘Vitya.’

‘This right here, two golds, this puts him in a whole different stratosphere,’ said Wild's brother, Mike. ‘He'll go down in history. This is what it's all about.’

And it further validated Wild's decision to marry Zavarzina, a Moscow native, in 2011.

Culture shock: For an American from a small Washington state town, adjusting to a life in Moscow has been an uphill battle made more difficult due to a language barrier

The two friends became romantically involved in 2009 before being wed nearly three years ago. Wild saw it as a chance not only to be with the woman he loves, but also to become a member of a nascent Russian snowboarding team looking to make splash in Sochi.

Frustrated by what he saw as a lack of funding from the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Association, Wild has blossomed after trading the Stars & Stripes for a different kind of red, white and blue.

‘Russia is the country that's given me the opportunity to win a medal. If I was still riding for the USA, I'd be back home with perhaps some mediocre job doing something mediocre,’ Wild said after winning his first gold medal earlier this week.

He placed third at the world championships last year and was easily the best snowboarder in his sport's answer to Alpine skiing.

The victories are also worth about $250,000 to Wild and his wife. Zavarzina didn't make it out of first round of elimination Saturday, but it hardly mattered.

Their windfall at the Extreme Park means maybe they can move out of the 300-square foot apartment they share in Moscow.

Reflecting back on his roller-coaster ride of a career in snowboarding, Wild told reporters Wednesday his path was not for everyone.

Harsh words: Wild told reporters that had he stayed in US, he probably would have been stuck in a 'mediocre job and doing something mediocre'

Frenemies: Wild admitted that some of his Russian team mates were not delighted by his arrival, but still helped him adjust

‘All my friends, they understand,’ he said of his former U.S. team mates. ‘They've seen me at my lows, they know that it was very important for me - my entire life - that I make this switch and that I give it one more shot.

‘If I hadn't done this, I think I'd always be wondering, “what if?” You don't want to live your life like that,’ he said.

Wild and 24-year-old Zavarazina met in 2009 and were married in July 2011.

They celebrated what Wild called a ‘full-on Siberian wedding in Novosibirsk. The American expat admitted that he did not understand much of what was said during the ceremony. 

‘It was probably more stressful than today. It was the most stressful day of my life,’ he said, smiling. ‘I was walking into one building, thinking to myself, “Dude, you are way too far from home to run!”’

Moving to Moscow has also been something of a culture shock for the young man from a small northwestern town of just over 2,000.

Big plans: Wild revealed that he intends to snowboard for another four years, and to learn his new language properly

‘Moving to the big city was hard for me, for sure. The first couple of months I was quite depressed, but once I started learning how to enjoy Moscow, life's actually been a lot better,’ he said.

Wild indicated that some of his Russian team mates were not delighted by his arrival.

‘My team mates helped me so much,’ he said wryly. ‘I don't think many of them like me so much but I really appreciate it.’

Wild revealed that he plans to snowboard for another four years, and to learn his new language properly.

‘I'm very focused on snowboard and training, and I haven't put in the time I need to for really speaking. I can get around and do simple stuff, but I'm not a Russian speaker,’ he said.
