Phil Blair, HTC President of Europe Middle East and Africa said: 'The best artists have always been given gold discs to celebrate their success, but today most people listen to music on their phone.

'We wanted to celebrate that fact.'

Goldgenie has previously made bespoke phones for Denzel Washington, Will Smith and Kate Moss, but this is the first time they have worked directly with an Android manufacturer.
