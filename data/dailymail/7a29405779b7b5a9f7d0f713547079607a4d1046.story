One of Air New Zealand’s two Dreamliners is back in the skies again just days after it was hit by lightning during a fierce spring storm last week.

The lightning strike occurred as the Boeing 787-9 landed safely in Perth following a seven-hour journey from Auckland last Thursday afternoon.

Aircraft engineers discovered scorch marks on the fuselage, so the aircraft was taken out of service and flown back to Auckland without any passengers for further inspection and repairs.

It is carrying passengers again after it was given the all clear over the weekend.

An airline spokeswoman told the New Zealand Herald: ‘The incident forced the cancellation of a flight from Perth to Auckland which was due to operate on Thursday evening.

‘The aircraft, a Boeing 787-9, was assessed by engineers in Perth and cleared to operate positioning flight NZ6014 back to Air New Zealand's engineering and maintenance base in Auckland where full engineering support is available.’

In an attempt to ease any fears for nervous flyers, the spokeswoman said such incidents not uncommon and aircraft are designed to withstand lightning strikes.

Air New Zealand didn’t provide statistics on the frequency of lightning strikes involving its planes, but at least 75 incidents have been reported in Australia in 2014, according to the country’s transport safety bureau.

Dreamliners have a composite fuselage rather than metal, and its embedded conducting material is designed to absorb a lightning strike.

The worst air tragedy related to a lightning strike occurred in the US state of Maryland in December 1963.

Eighty-one people died after a bolt of lightning ignited fuel vapours and caused an explosion that brought down a Boeing 707-121 operated by Pan Am.
