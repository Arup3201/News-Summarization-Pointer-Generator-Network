Headteacher Susan Papas has become the victim of abuse after improving lateness and discipline at the school

A headteacher who was sent in to transform a failing primary has become the victim of a hate campaign after she asked parents to stop smoking at the school gates.

Susan Papas was asked to take over Selsdon Primary School after it was heavily criticised by Ofsted inspectors.

But after improving lateness and discipline, she received a barrage of anonymous abuse from parents - including a petition entitled Get The B****es Out, aimed at her and her female deputy.

Mrs Papas, 53, arrived at the South London school in September after the local authority was impressed how she vastly improved the results of a nearby primary.

After a few weeks, she ‘respectfully’ asked parents to refrain from smoking outside the school’s gates, ‘as some may see this as setting a bad example’.

Mrs Papas also kept parents informed about other issues on her online blog, but said she started receiving abusive messages after inviting a fellow parent to sell cakes priced between 10p and 20p to pupils as a treat at break-time on Fridays.

A group of parents have allegedly now threatened to smoke in a ‘picket line’ outside the school gates. 

They had also vowed in online messages to ‘smash up the van’ the parent sold the cakes from after they were branded ‘unhealthy’.

Mrs Papas, 53, said she was shocked when she saw the petition and did not expect it at the school, because it was much more ‘middle-class’ than the one she ran before.

She said: ‘I was prepared for some resistance but not the nastiness and threats. I just want to make sure the children do well.

'All this unpleasantness is a handful of parents. I think for a long time they have been allowed to bully the other parents, so it was time to take a stand. 

'When this happened it did make me initially think “why am I doing this?”, but I’m quite stubborn.

‘This problem needs to be resolved. We promote responsible behaviour and I would not tolerate bullying from the pupils or my staff so why should I from some of the parents?

'I think the best way to deal with bullying is to expose it and have it discussed out in the open. That is why I put it on the blog.

‘I think any parent has the right to smoke. However, I asked parents not to outside the school gates as it’s a narrow road and a lot of other parents who were arriving with buggies were complaining about the smoke they could not escape.

‘Some of my methods, like discipline, have been viewed as old-fashioned, but it is done in a forward-thinking way to better the school.’ 

The anonymous petition was brought into school after one was put through the letterbox of a teacher’s home.

Some parents have also complained they have received them through their doors overnight.

Despite the abuse, Mrs Papas said she had no intention of closing the online blog, which has been popular at her former school, Heavers Farm Primary, in South Norwood, where she remains executive head.

Since she took over Heavers Farm in 2007 it has rocketed up Croydon borough’s league table and is one of the top performing schools in the area.

In her drive to improve Selsdon primary quickly, Mrs Papas introduced lunchtime detentions for children who turned up late for classes, forgot their PE kit, misbehaved or did not complete their work to the correct standard in lessons.

She said school tardiness had dropped by a half once parents realised that for every minute their child was late they would spend two minutes in detention.

Sabrina Howes, 28, who now smokes away from the school while waiting for her child to finish for the day, said: ‘The new head has only been here for a few weeks and things are already so much better.

‘My little boy got a detention for doing one sentence in 20 minutes. I know he can do more than that.

'He hasn’t done it since because he knows if he doesn’t do his work, he’s staying in at lunchtime.

‘He’s only seven, he’s probably a bit too young to understand, but it has worked. I didn’t realise how bad some of the parents were until all this came out.’
