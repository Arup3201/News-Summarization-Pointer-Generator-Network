These incredible pictures are the work of a clever artist who has managed to make his models 'disappear' in his works by blending them in with their surroundings.

Laurent La Gamba, 47, has merged his love of art and sports cars to produce these spectacular camouflage works which show his models 'blended' with top of the range cars.

The married father-of-two, from Paris, France, spends up to two hours intricately painting each person with acrylics before photographing them in front of the high-powered cars.

Mr La Gamba, who used three BMWs and two Porsches for his latest work, shot each of the photographs in the Pyrenees, southern France, where he has a studio.

He said: 'Each shoot takes about a day. The people who model in my set are my friends and family.

'My friends Kerri and Wesley Ranger happily volunteered to be painted along with my son, Raphael La Gamba.

'I wanted to enrich my camouflage work and make the camouflage more difficult technically by using a moving image.

The 47-year-old said all of his artworks are original and are in no way re-touched or digitally edited

Mr La Gamba (far left) said: 'They make me proud and I have great fun in the process of making them' 

'The idea is also prompted by my interest in camouflage and my love of sports cars.'

Mr La Gamba, used his Porsche Boxster S, Porsche 944 S, BMW Z3 1.8 L, BMW Z3 1.9 L and one other BMW Z3 2.8 L for his new project.

He added: 'I hope to surprise people and also stun them with the technical achievement of my new work.

'This work is completely un-retouched by Photoshop or any other software.

The French artist said he spends up to two hours painting his models and up to a whole day taking the photos

He used friends and family members for his latest works and used three BMWs and two Porsches

'I am a painter, I paint the installation myself in full.

'Each outfit is painted to fit each environment and it takes about two hours.

'They make me proud and I have great fun in the process of making them.

'Some people laugh, some people admire it - others think it is software generated, so there is really a wide variety of reactions.'
