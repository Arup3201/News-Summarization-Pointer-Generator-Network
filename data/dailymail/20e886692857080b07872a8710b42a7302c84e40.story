A pair of middle-aged siblings who live in separate wings of a mansion dating back to the 12th century have squabbled their way into a criminal court.

The feud between the brother and sister, who no longer speak, is said to have escalated until Philip Baden Watkins smashed a window in his sister’s side of Flaxley Abbey.

Stroud magistrates’ court heard on Monday that the married 47-year-old father of two ‘snapped’ while coming home one night and attacked some of his own property before crossing the garden to the part of the abbey belonging to his sister, Lynn Zijlmans, 45.

She was put ‘in fear of her life’ when he then smashed one of her windows in the Grade I listed property near Blaisdon, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire.

It is not clear precisely what started the dispute between the two siblings, whose house was first built as a monastery and substantially rebuilt in the 18th century.

But it is thought that it was at least aggravated by the planned sale of a business they own together, which is thought to be a construction and lettings company. Appearing for Watkins, Jennifer Stetson said of the siblings’ relationship that: ‘To say it is acrimonious is an understatement. [Watkins] tells me difficulties became more acute with the approach of his sister and perhaps her wish to sabotage the sale.’

Prosecuting, Karen Grant told the court that Watkins ‘is in business with his sister and they live in separate wings.

‘It is a large property. It appears there have been difficulties and they no longer speak. They were in business but it is being sold.’

Referring to Watkins’s rampage, she said: ‘The defendant returned home with his wife and family on the night in question, and he smashed up his own post box.

‘Then, witnessed by his sister, he damaged a fence.

‘He walked across the garden to her wing. She feared for her safety and he smashed  a window.’

Miss Stetson, for Watkins, said that he had ‘snapped’ under pressure and done something that was out of character. ‘He deeply regrets his actions,’ she added. ‘It is a very sad situation.’

Watkins pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal damage at the property, which was left to the pair by their grandfather, the industrialist Fred Watkins, who bought it in 1960.

The house was originally a Cistercian monastery founded in around 1148 by the second Earl of Hereford.

After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s it was given to Sir William Kingston, who had been the Constable of the Tower of London and supervised the execution of Anne Boleyn.

District Judge Joti Bopa-Rai told Watkins: ‘It’s a shame you have to come before a court at your age.

‘Bearing in mind there is acrimony, I will give you a 24-month conditional discharge.’

Watkins was also ordered to pay £85 towards prosecution costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Neither of the siblings could be reached for comment yesterday.
