A suicidal mother has been charged with murder for killing both her children before a failed suicide attempt Saturday morning.

Marilyn Edge, 42, of Scottsdale, AZ., tried taking her own life in a car accident in Costa Mesa, CA before telling responding cops they would be able to find her 13-year-old autistic son Jaelen Edge and 10-year-old daughter Faith in a nearby hotel room. The young childrens' bodies were discovered just after 8:30am at a Hampton Inn in Santa Ana.

The cause of death for both children has not yet been made public, nor have their causes of death. Their identities have been revealed by MailOnline. Ms Edge previously sued the federal government alleging her son developed autism after a vaccination.

Disturbed: Marilyn Edge, 42, tried to kill herself at least twice before telling cops where to find her dead children, officials said

Crime scene investigators photograph a car believed to be driven by a women who allegedly tried to commit suicide by ramming it into a utility box behind a Costa Mesa shopping center. Her children were found dead in the Hampton Inn Suites in Santa Ana

Initially taken to the hospital to tend to her injuries after the accident - in which she slammed her car into parking poles surrounding a utility box located behind a shopping plaza - Ms Edge is now in police custody after being charged with two counts of murder.

'It was clear that it was an intentional act,' Costa Mesa spokesperson Tim Starn said.

The disturbed woman refused to get out of the gray Honda Accord and attempted to strangle herself to death with an electrical
 cord while emergency responders frantically broke a window to enter the car and save her, according to KABC.

Ms Edge had an even more grisly secret to share once investigators broke her windows and discovered propane tanks inside, perhaps an attempt to blow the car up in an accident - her children were dead.

Awful: The woman told cops where her children were after multiple failed suicide attempts, according to Santa Ana Police spokesperson Anthony Bertagna

She allegedly told paramedics where to find both Jaelen and Faith while en-route to a local hospital, officials said.

'We linked the two crime scenes based on statements made by the woman at the scene of the crash,' Mr Bertagna said while briefing local media.

The children do not appear to have been shot or stabbed, said Mr Bertagna. No weapons were recovered at either scene, he added.

The parking poles kept any harm from being inflicted on the utility box during Ms Edge's failed suicide, Mr Bertagna noted.

Shocking: One hotel guest called the killings 'horrendous' and 'a heartbreaker'

It is not clear what brought the doomed trio to the California town, about 40 miles south of Los Angeles, but a review of court records by MailOnline is starting to piece together part of what may have driven Ms Edge to Saturday's tragic events.

The doting mother sued the Secretary of Health and Human Services in 2004, alleging a vaccination gave her son autism, court records showed. The case was dismissed only last year.

Citing a lack of medical records supporting Ms Edge's claim, and the lack of a valid medical opinion to further bloster it, Chief Special Master Patricia Campbell-Smith dismissed the suit for 'insufficient proof.'

Ms Edge was awarded a judgement in the amount of $7,692 to settle legal fees owed for the suit. It is not clear if or when she ever received that money.

The double homicide left locals and hotel guests stunned.

'My goodness if there's two children involved that's just horrendous to say the least,' Mike Ramey told KABC 'As a parent, it's just a heartbreaker.'

A motive for the childrens' deaths has not yet been established, and authorities are now searching for their father, KABC reported. Their causes of death have also still not been made public and are pending the coroner's report.

Ms Edge is sitting in a jail cell while investigators try to piece together the series of events that led to the death of her two innocent children.
