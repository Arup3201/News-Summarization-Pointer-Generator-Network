Romelu Lukaku believes he is a learning a lot from former Everton striker Duncan Ferguson after undertaking special training sessions with the Toffees coach.

The Belgium international, who joined Roberto Martinez's side on a permanent deal last summer, has revealed that he works with the 42-year-old at least three times a week in a bid to become a better forward.

Lukaku has netted four goals since moving to Goodison Park on a permanent deal but he insists Ferguson can help him develop his game even further.

Lukaku told the Liverpool Echo: 'I can learn a lot from Duncan about holding up the ball. Even sometimes in training he'll stop and show me something. The way he holds up the ball is so impressive. Also the way he finishes from crosses as well with his head. It's all impressive.

'I work with Duncan and (assistant manager) Graeme Jones all the time. I go with them after training on Tuesday, Wednesday and sometimes Thursday or Friday. At least three times a week.'

Ferguson, who is part of Martinez's first-team staff after enjoying three spells as an Everton player, is a cult hero on the blue half of Merseyside but the 21-year-old admits he was unfamiliar with the Scot because of his age.

He added: 'I was too young to watch Duncan much when he was playing. Most of the time when I watched Everton as a kid it was Wayne Rooney. I remember him scoring the goal against Arsenal. My brother was an Arsenal fan so I was happy because I supported Chelsea.

'But I knew Duncan was a big figure for the club and I looked up some videos when I first came here. It's then I saw the important goals he scored and how much he meant to the fans.'
