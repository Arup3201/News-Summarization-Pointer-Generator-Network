A giant squid has been filmed launching a frantic attack beneath the waves on a passing submarine.

The ten-legged beast is seen launching itself towards the vessel, whipping its tentacles at the hull.

People in charge of the submarine try to frighten the beast away by shining a bright light at the squid, which only enrages it further and prompts a second attack.

Back! The submarine shines a bright light in the squid's direction to scare it away - to limited effect

The panicked cephalopod  then fires a huge burst of ink at the submarine - which thankfully seems to do no damage.

Shortly after, the squid swims away without having damaged the submarine.

The encounter was filmed in the Bering Sea - the body of water between Russia and Alaska.

Greenpeace, who were running the mission, uploaded the footage to their Vine account yesterday.
