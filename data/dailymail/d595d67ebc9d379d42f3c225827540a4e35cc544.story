A secret file on ‘unnatural’ sexual behaviour at Westminster that was given to Margaret Thatcher has been discovered.

The document contains allegations ‘of unnatural sexual proclivities’ against high-profile figures, and was prepared for the then Prime Minister in the 1980s.

Last night campaigning MP John Mann suggested it may form part of a cover-up over a VIP paedophile ring operating at the time.

Top secret: An academic has unearthed this classified file about 'unnatural sexual' behaviour at the heart of Westminster but the Government will not release the document

Mrs Thatcher's press secretary Sir Bernard Ingham, (left) pictured with the former Prime MInister, said  he 'could not recall the file' but confirmed they both knew about sex crime allegations aimed at a minister

He said there was a secret Downing Street meeting over the file in 1982 and its potentially explosive contents were thought to be so damaging that the Cabinet Office decided as recently as a few years ago that it should remain classified.

The paper was only discovered by chance by an academic while he was researching secret Thatcher files at the National Archives in Kew, South West London.

Child abuse campaigners have reacted with fury after it emerged the file was not handed over to an NSPCC review into government documents on child abuse.

Last night the Cabinet Office promised to reveal it to the Government’s child abuse inquiry, suggesting its contents are highly relevant. 

But campaigners said it should be made public and shown to the police to prevent any alleged abusers escaping justice.

The file was found by Dr Chris Murphy, a security and intelligence lecturer at the University of Salford, who was trawling though catalogue records at the National Archives for security documents.

The contents of the document remain secret, with only the title of the mystery file publicly listed as: ‘PREM19/588 - SECURITY. Allegations against former public [word missing] of unnatural sexual proclivities; security aspects 1980 Oct 27 - 1981 Mar 20.’

According to Dr Murphy, it was found among hundreds of so-called ‘Prem’ files – security documents that passed through the prime minister’s office. 

Research: Dr Chris Murphy from the University of Salford found the new classified file and believes that because of its title Margaret Thatcher will have seen it

He said: ‘I do not know what are the contents of this document, but the fact that the file is headed security and went to the Prime Minister’s office is suggestive of the fact that we are talking about someone’s sexual behaviour becoming a matter of national security.’ Despite the seeming importance of the document, NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless who led last year’s review into how the Home Office handled child abuse allegations between 1979 and 1999, said nobody showed it to him.

He told Sky News: ‘If there is pertinent material in this file it should be submitted to the sexual abuse inquiry as well as the relevant police force so they can conduct a criminal investigation if necessary.’

Last night Mr Mann said: ‘The question must be how many more files relate to prominent people, MPs, politicians in relation to child abuse and why have they not been made available to Peter Wanless or the Metropolitan Police?’

National security: The paperwork, listed by the National Archive in Kew, pictured, has been classified for for 35 years on grounds of national security and is still in the hands of the Cabinet Office

Yesterday Mrs Thatcher’s former press secretary, Sir Bernard Ingham, told Sky News he could not recall the file, although he said Lady Thatcher was aware of allegations against a government minister in the early 1980s.

She has previously been linked to the historic child abuse scandal after her former aide Sir Peter Morrison was accused of raping an underage boy.

A former bodyguard to Lady Thatcher said he warned her of rumours about her private parliamentary secretary, but he was still appointed Tory deputy party chairman. Sir Peter died in 1995 aged 51 and was never charged with any offence.

Secret life: Sir Peter Hayman had a double identity and used to rent a flat to keep child pornography - but was only given a police caution

Diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, a decorated diplomat who lived a secret life as a paedophile, was named by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1981 using Parliamentary privilege.

The new document, revealed today by Sky News, was written about the same period. 

Hayman was member ‘330’ of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children.

He rented a flat at 95 Linden Gardens, Notting Hill Gate, London under the name of Peter Henderson to store PIE literature and graphic correspondence with fellow paedophiles.

But Sir Peter made a mistake and left a packet of paedophile material in an envelope on a London bus. 

It was addressed to Mr Henderson at Linden Gardens in Notting Hill.Soon afterwards, in November 1978, police raided the Linden Gardens flat.

What they found there was a huge trove of paedophilia and other extreme pornography.

Among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which Sir Peter had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies, the latter including sex with minors. 

Even the hardened police of the Obscene Publications Squad were ‘revolted’ by the Linden Gardens haul.

He sobbed as he was interviewed and feared he would be exposed and his reputation ruined. And yet he wasn't. 

Much to the anger and disbelief of the Obscene Publications Squad he was only given a caution.  He died in 1992 aged 77.

Geoffrey Dickens also said that an unnamed senior civil servant was helping to run a paedophile ring from Whitehall.

The MP claimed the man had at least 57 obscene slides of men having sex with children.

He said at the time: 'I'm concerned about the cover-up of a senior civil servant who is a paedophile and wants sex with children legalised. He is a security risk'.

Academic found paperwork still classified on national security grounds

It contains 'PREM SECURITY' in title - which means it was for Mrs Thatcher

The troubled inquiry into historic child sex abuse has suspended work until Home Secretary Theresa May makes a firm decision on its future. The independent panel will not hold any further meetings with victims until either a chairman is appointed or a decision is taken whether to replace it. On Tuesday, one expert on the panel claimed she was being ‘bullied and intimidated’ by the counsel to the inquiry. The rest of the panel distanced themselves from the allegation, which the counsel also denied.
