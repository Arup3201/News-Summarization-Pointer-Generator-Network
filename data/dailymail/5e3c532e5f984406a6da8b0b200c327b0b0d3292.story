A grieving father today spoke of his outrage his daughter's murderer could be released from prison - in the year she would have turned 40.

Peter Streader, 71, says Marrick Rogers, 39, who sexually assaulted and murdered his 23-year-old daughter Claire in 1999, should remain in prison until he's at least 65.

But he says officials have told him  Rogers, who still hasn't admitted the murder despite being convicted on DNA evidence, could be released soon.

Rogers strangled Claire with her own jumper and was jailed in June 2000. He has always denied the crime

Rogers was found guilty by a jury in June 2000 of killing Claire before strangling her with her own jumper and dumping her body in a park in Canterbury, Kent.

He was handed a life sentence with a minimum of 12 and a half years and has served 15 years.

Mr Streader says Rogers has recently been moved to an open prison and is enjoying home visits to see his family.

The former engineer, of Chartham, Kent, said Rogers should not be allowed to continue with his life when mother-of-one Claire, who worked as a cleaner, had hers taken away.

He said: 'People just don't seem to get life anymore. He's served 15 years, which is more than his minimum sentence, but to me it just isn't enough.

'I think a life imprisonment should a life sentence and it's not.

'I don't believe in capital punishment, I have always said that, but 65 seems likes an appropriate age to be released.'

He added: 'By that time you don't really have much of a life in front of you.

'You won't be able to get a job, you can't have a family, but all these things will be available to him when he gets out.

'All these things that he took away from Claire and us as a family.'

Rogers, a taxi driver, was convicted at Lewes Crown Court after his saliva was found on Claire's breast and bra following the murder on May 31 1999.

He was originally ordered to serve a minimum of 14 years in prison but that was reduced to 12-and-a-half years on appeal.

Claire's parents made an attempt to fight the sentence, which they believed was too short, but they were knocked back.

An appeal by Merrick against his conviction was rejected in 2006.
