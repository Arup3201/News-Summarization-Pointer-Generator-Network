Twelve-year-old Luka suffers from muscular dystrophy - a cruel degenerative disease which confines him to a wheelchair and will make him weaker and weaker over time.

But with these beautiful pictures, entitled 'The Little Prince', friend and photographer Matej Peljhan has allowed him to explore an imaginary world where he can shoot a basketball, climb stairs and even perform a handstand.

Amazingly, the images did not require any digital trickery, Matej simply used coloured sheets and carefully placed objects and took the pictures from above.

Trickery: The images were created without the help of Photoshop simply using coloured sheets and household objects

Imaginary world: The touching images allowed Luka, 12, to experience pleasures beyond the confines of his wheelchair

Inspired: The idea for the pictures came when Luka said he would like to see himself in photographs getting up to mischief

Due to his condition, Luka is unable to do even the most basic of everyday activities such as washing himself, dressing, and eating. 

His physical capability is mostly limited to tiny movements of his fingers, which allow him to move about in his electric wheelchair.

But he is also able to hold a coloured pen, with which he can slowly turn his imagination into drawings in a notebook.

The idea for the photographs came from a conversation Slovenian photographer Matej Peljhan had with Luka when he said he would like to see himself in pictures, getting up to mischief.

He pictured Luka from above as he posed on the ground, capturing the boy’s fighting spirit, positive attitude, and fun personality.

Personality: The images gave Luka the chance to showcase his determination, positive attitude and mischievous character

Black canvas: A world of opportunity was opened up to Luka, using just these coloured sheets
