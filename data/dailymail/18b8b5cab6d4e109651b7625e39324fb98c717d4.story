If you want to party at college, Syracuse University is your best bet.

The New York college has claimed the title of nation's top party school, according to The Princeton Review.

The nationwide survey of 130,000 students also found Syracuse's student newspaper ranked second best among the 379 colleges, while its sports scene, rated third best, likely helped the party mood.

University officials had no immediate 
comment on the private university's showing in the 2015 edition of 'The 
Best 379 Colleges'.

The 
book contains 62 top-20 lists gauging student satisfaction with 
professors, financial aid awards, athletic facilities, food and other 
factors.

Rounding out the 
top five party schools were: the University of Iowa (last year's 
winner), the University of California-Santa Barbara, West Virginia 
University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Repeating at the top of the 'stone-cold sober' schools was Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.Syracuse's central New York neighbor Colgate University topped the list of most beautiful campuses.

The
 university of Chicago was found to have the best college library, and 
students voted Virginia Tech's dining hall offerings as the best campus 
food.

Other No. 1 spots: Stanford University
 in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-friendly category; Elon 
University in North Carolina as best-run college; Washington University 
in St. Louis, Missouri, for its dorms; and Yale University for best 
newspaper.

'Our purpose is 
not to crown one college 'best' overall or to rank these distinctive 
schools 1 to 379 on any single topic,' said Princeton Review senior vice
 president Robert Franek.

'We
 present our 62 ranking lists to give applicants the broader base of 
campus feedback to choose the college that's best for them.'

Northeastern
 University in Boston took the No. 1 spot on the list of best career 
services. Oregon's Reed College topped the list of best professors, and 
the happiest students were found at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, 
according to the rankings.

An
 average of 343 students per campus were asked 80 questions about their 
schools and themselves during the 2013-14 and/or previous two school 
years.

With no affiliation to Princeton University, the Natick, 
Massachusetts-based Princeton Review has published 'The Best 379
