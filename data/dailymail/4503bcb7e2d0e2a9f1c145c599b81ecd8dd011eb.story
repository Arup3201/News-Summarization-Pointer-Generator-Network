John Redwood, who produced the figures, says cutting the rate further would produce another surge in revenue helping to ease the deficit

The amount of tax paid by the best-off has soared since George Osborne slashed the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, according to a new analysis.

New figures from HM Revenue & Customs show the total income tax collected on earnings over £150,000 has shot up from £40 billion last year to £49 billion this year.

Former Conservative Cabinet minister John Redwood, who produced the figures, said it appeared the Chancellor’s tax cut was having dramatic results in what would be a ‘shock to many of the conventional pundits’ who criticised the measure.

He said the boost in income tax take suggested the Chancellor should go further, and make the 45p rate ‘more competitive’.

‘Total income tax collected from people earning more than £150,000 has surged from £40bn to £49bn this year compared to last.

'It has more than made up for the loss of tax revenue from lower earners following the big increase in tax thresholds,’ Mr Redwood said.

He said the 50p rate introduced by Labour in its final weeks in power was clearly ‘costly’.

Britain lost high earners overseas, and saw the richest use tax loopholes to declare less income when the rate was high.

‘The rareified group of people earning more than £2m declared income of £12.2bn in 2012-13, but paid tax on £26bn of income the following year with the lower rate.

‘This small group of people alone more than paid for the rise in threshold to take many lower earners out of tax altogether.

‘The top one per cent of earners now earn 13 per cent of the income but pay 28 per cent of the total income tax. The top five per cent earn one quarter of the income but pay around half the total income tax.

‘This progressive structure works as long as the government does not get too greedy, setting a higher rate which means the rich pay less because they either go or they earn and declare less.

‘I wonder how much more revenue the Treasury would enjoy if the top rate were set at a more competitive rate?

'I suspect that too would see a further surge in revenue, money the state clearly needs to end the deficit.’

George Osborne cut the 50p top rate of tax to 45p in his 2012 budget, saying it raised 'next to nothing'

A Tory spokesman said: ‘The Government is clear that in clearing up Labour’s economic mess those with broadest shoulders should bear the biggest burden.’

David Cameron will today hail the Government’s tax changes taking effect this week as the most radical for two decades.

On Tuesday, corporation tax came down to 21 per cent, the tax-free annual investment allowance for businesses was doubled, business rates were capped at two per cent and fuel duty was frozen.

From Sunday, over one million businesses will benefit from up to £2,000 ‘cashback’ on their National Insurance contributions.

The Prime Minister is to visit three businesses who are announcing a combined total of nearly 10,000 new jobs, including Accenture, which is taking on 500 new employees; Birmingham Airport, which is extending its runway leading to 4,000 jobs in the airport and an additional 4,000 jobs in the supply chain; and Vodafone is taking on an extra 1,400 staff.

Mr Cameron said: ‘A key part of our long-term economic plan is to create jobs and to cut taxes. So I am delighted that in the week where we are cutting tax for 26 million hard-working people – and now taking three million out of tax altogether – I can announce nearly 10,000 more jobs which will give people financial security for the future.’

The personal income tax allowance will be raised this weekend from £9,440 to £10,000, cutting tax for the typical basic rate taxpayer by £705 this year.
