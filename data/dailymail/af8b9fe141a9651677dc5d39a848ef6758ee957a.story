In Valley Parade’s cramped and drafty media room with zero space for manoeuvre amid the television cameras, laptops, reporters and tea ladies, Gus Poyet still managed to unearth a new excuse for Sunderland’s shortcomings.

We’ve had his players, the fans, the club hierarchy and referees – now it’s the turn of the Press.

'The problem is you, not me,’ he said, nodding towards a small gathering of North-East journalists, myself included.

'If we close Sunderland - if we put a China Wall around the city - it would be fantastic.

'Now, when we let you in and you get out and say what you want, we've got a problem. I invite every Sunderland fan and people around the club not to listen to any one of you - only to me.' 

Poyet, then, wants to create a closed state where supporters are only exposed to his words and no outside interpretation of them. Too often, however, he talks in riddles - it needs a third party to decode his message.

But following the 2-0 humiliation at Bradford his target was clear, and it wasn't the players who had just under-performed so badly against League One opposition.

Poyet’s mood lurches between happy, sad, relief and frustration – often all within the confines of one interview.

He is, at his best, and normally during a pre-match media gathering, engaging, funny, honest and vibrant.

Earlier this month he sat for 20 minutes and told us all about his famous father, Washington, who captained the national basketball team at the Olympics. He enjoyed it, and so did we.

Fast forward to the aftermath of last week’s defeat to QPR and he’s at the other end of the court, on the defensive and accusing his players of pandering to the want of supporters – ‘crazy football’ he called it.

Just a fortnight earlier, following the most arduous goalless draw with Fulham, Poyet said the club’s fans were ‘living in the past’ and pining for Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips. It didn’t go down well.

Previously he has spoken of his players not being able to implement the style of play he wants, while sporting director Lee Congerton, pre January, was the subject of pressure to deliver the personnel he needed to avoid a repeat of last season’s relegation fight. ‘I am only the head coach, I only pick the team,’ a favourite soundbite of Poyet’s.

But always, given a few days to reflect, he attempts to play down the subsequent headlines and offers reason for his post-game outbursts.

So why now does he turn on the Press? He was asked that as he squeezed out of the media room on Sunday, the ‘China Wall’ analogy his final utterance. He refused to answer.

Poyet previously claimed Sunderland fans were pining for the days of strikers Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips 

Reporters who do not work the North-East patch were stunned by his attack. This, however, has been bubbling under the surface for a while and it was inevitable the Press would eventually incur his wrath given that all other factions had previously been targeted. He is in danger of alienating himself and club bosses will be concerned at the situation which is unfolding.

During the second half at Bradford, supporters sang ‘Gustavo Poyet, it’s always our fault’ before a scuffle broke out in the away end – it demonstrated more fighting spirit than the players had shown on the pitch and they were duly booed at the end of the game.

It has left a huge disconnect between all parties – Poyet, players, supporters and Press.

Results, of course, can change everything. But Sunderland have won just four times in the Premier League this season and currently reside just two points above the relegation zone. It has been a sorry season, low on energy and entertainment.

The significance of Saturday’s visit of West Brom cannot be underplayed, both in terms of points on the board and mood on the terraces.

Before then, it promises to be interesting when Poyet meets with the Press on Thursday. Once we have scaled the wall that is…
