Heartbroken Robert Pattinson is still 'not ready' to talk to girlfriend Kristen Stewart, but instead wants to have a 'man to man' chat with Rupert Sanders, the director who she was caught cheating with.

The devastated British actor has moved out of the Los Feliz home he shared with Kristen after incriminating photographs showing Kristen and Rupert together were released on Tuesday.

'Rob wants to have a man to man chat with Rupert to find out exactly what happened between him and Kristen,' a source told Radar.

Man to man: Robert Pattinson is said to want to talk to director Rupert Sanders following his fling with Kristen Stewart

'Kristen has already betrayed his trust 
by cheating, so he can't be sure that she will tell him exactly what 
went on between her and Rupert. Rupert has a wife and a family to save, 
so Rob feels like he has nothing left to lose and would be honest with 
him.'

Sanders, 41, is married to model and actress Liberty Ross and they have two children together.

The inside source told the website that Robert, feels 'doubly betrayed' because he 'trusted' Rupert as the director of Kristen's film Snow White and the Huntsman.

'Rob really was blindsided by this and he's going through the typical stages of being cheated on,' the source said.

As they were: All was well for Robert and Kristen Stewart as they appeared together at last weekend's Teen Choice Awards

'He
was hurt and heartbroken, then angry and p****d off, and now he just 
wants answers. He feels like he needs to know exactly what happened, how
far it went and how many times, so he can figure out if this is 
something he can move past.

'He's not ready to talk with Kristen, it's too painful, so he's going to Rupert.'

Even if Robert doesn't want to see or hear from Kristen, the pair will be reunited at the premiere of the final instalment of the Twilight Saga, Breaking Dawn Part 2, in November.

Kristen released a statement saying: 'I’m deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I’ve caused.

'This
momentary indiscretion has jeopardised the most important thing in my 
life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love 
him, I’m so sorry.'

However, Radar's insider said that recent events had Robert 'questioning Kristen's apology.'

They said: 'Rob just doesn't know who or 
what to believe right now .And he'll do whatever it 
takes to find out the truth.'

Fling: Kristen, pictured with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders in May, has apologised for her 'momentary indiscretion' with the married 41-year-old

Out: The actor is understood to have pack his bags and left the LA home they share

It was reported yesterday by The UK Mirror that  the 26-year-old British actor ‘couldn’t believe what 
he was hearing’ when Kristen told him the fling was just a ‘one off.'

The newspaper's source added: ‘Rob
is devastated and deeply hurt. They spoke on the phone and he said 
“You’ve completely humiliated me. All the trust has gone."'

It's
unclear exactly when Robert found out about the 22-year-old's affair 
with the Snow White and the Huntsman director, who has two children with 
British model Liberty Ross.

Kristen
and Rupert were photographed in the throes of passion on July 17 but 
the images did not surface in the media until two days ago.

And
while Kristen and her married director paramour have both issued 
grovelling apologies for their exposed affair, Robert has remained 
resolutely silent.

Keeping her secret: The pair enjoyed a night out in Hollywood on July 19... two days after her tryst with the director

The source told the Mirror that he was ‘furious ‘ Robert who demanded Kristen apologise and she agreed.

'Robert wanted the world to know that he hadn’t done 
anything wrong and that she had made a fool of him publicly,' said the insider.

Should Robert Pattinson forgive Kristen Stewart for cheating?

'He still can’t fathom why she cheated. Kristen is begging for another chance. Robert is undecided.'

The couple were last seen in public at the Teen Choice Awards together on July 22 looking like a decidedly happy couple. 

But fellow attendees back stage at the ceremony detected some tension between them away from cameras, with a source telling the New York Post:
'Rob and Kristen were having a long and intense conversation backstage,
and he looked miserable, heartbroken and humiliated. She was pleading.'

The actor made his feelings regarding
infidelity clear in April, telling Vanity Fair: 'There's a thing I've 
never got: That is, why do people cheat?'

He explained that while he 'can 
understand the impulse' to cheat, he doesn't comprehend 'how you can 
keep two relationships going at the same time for long.'

Taking direction: Kristen and Rupert seen chatting in between takes on the set of Snow White And The Huntsman

Married with children: Ruper Sanders is married to model and actress Liberty Ross and they have two children

'I'm not the casual-affair kind of 
guy,' he said. 'If I choose to be with someone, it's because I really 
want it. When I have a relationship, I'm 100 percent into it.'

The star has not emerged since details of the dalliance hit the press.

Us Weekly detailed the liaison, with a source saying Rupert was 'all over' Kristen. 

Another source added they 'would only take a 
break [from kissing] when they thought someone was walking by.'

A photographer followed Kristen from her Los Feliz home and
when the actress pulled into the parking lot of a deserted building and
Rupert got into her car.

The source explained: 'It seemed like they couldn't get enough. Kristen 
was sitting up with her back against the driver's-side window, and this 
guy was kissing her entire body.'

The pair left when they thought they were being watched and drove to an 
area near the Hollywood sign and Kristen appeared 'swept up in the 
moment' as they kissed and cuddled outside the car.

While the area they were in was quite deserted, they were disturbed by 
some dog walkers and each time 'as soon as they heard a voice, they 
would split up and walk in opposite directions'.

Meanwhile,
the young heartthrobs new movie The Rover has been given the green 
light by Screen Australia, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Set
in the Australian desert, The Rover is a futuristic western that 'tells
the story of Eric (Guy Pearce), who has left everything, everyone and 
every semblance of human kindness behind him, as he’s forced to join an 
injured gang member, Rey (Pattinson), to hunt down Rey’s gang after they
steal the last of Eric’s possessions.'

Charlize Theron and Lily Cole, at the London premiere of the movie last 
month
