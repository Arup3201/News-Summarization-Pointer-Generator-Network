Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera is determined to emulate club legend Paul Scholes.

The Spaniard arrived at Old Trafford this summer from Athletic Bilbao for £29m and has made an impressive start, scoring twice in three games.

The 25-year-old has revealed he wants to match the goalscoring exploits of Scholes, who he admired for his work ethic and incredible attacking capabilities.

Scholes scored 155 goals during 19 trophy laden seasons at Manchester United, making a total of 718 club appearances.

'Goalscoring is not one of my best qualities,' admitted Herrera to MUTV. 'But I think it's very important for midfielders.

'The best midfielders in the world like Paul Scholes scored hundreds of goals. I want to make and score more goals and I wish one day that I can be like Scholes.

The Spaniard has adapted immediately to life in the Premier League and already has two goals to his name

'I have a lot of respect for him and I always enjoyed watching him. He always worked hard, helped the team and always made a lot of chances not only for himself but for all his team-mates.

'I know it will be difficult but I wish that one day I can be similar to him.'

Herrera is delighted by his move to United despite Louis van Gaal's side continuing to struggle on the pitch.

Herrera has some way to go to emulate United club legend Paul Scholes, who scored 155 during 19 seasons

'I am very happy of course because after a few months I have experienced everything – at Old Trafford, in the city and in the club.

'Now I know how big the club is,' added Herrera. 'Being on tour was amazing, but when you come to Manchester and you play at Old Trafford you feel the real Manchester United.

'I'm really enjoying things and looking forward to the rest of the season. I want to help the team achieve our objectives.'

The former England international has since turned to punditry having retired from football in 2013
