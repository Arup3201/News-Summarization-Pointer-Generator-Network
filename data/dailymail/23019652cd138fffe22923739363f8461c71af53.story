These are the magical pictures that create the illusion of a phantom mountain on the horizon.

Adventurous photographer Roberto Bereto climbed to the summit of Mount Rocciamelone in the Italian Graian Alps 25 times to capture his astonishing images of the mind-boggling sight.

After spotting the trick of the light for the first time, the 43-year-old, from Rivoli in Turin, became committed to making the three-and-a-half hour journey as often as he could.

Sheer magnificence: The shadow falling across a valley at sunset looks exactly like the outline of another mountain

He has now collected an impressive collection of photos of the shadowy double mountain, all taken at sunset from 3,538 metres up.

On some occasions he would be thwarted by the cloud, but on others he would capture the perfect spectacle.

Mr Bereto, a professional musician, originally noticed the beautiful illusion while on a camping trip in the area.

'I was setting 
things up to spend the night at high altitude and getting a bit of clean
snow to melt for water,' he said.

'Looking east I saw this massive area, like a huge mantle, conical and dark.

Romantic view: The vista from more than 3,000ft up makes a misty peak appear, nestled among Italy's Graian Alps

Spirits in the sky: Mr Bereto says the ghostly effect prompts a 'rediscovery' of nature's phenomenons

'I thought "Wow". The mountain seemed to be projecting itself into the valleys below.

'I've seen many shadows around the Alps,
all kinds of reflection and endless plays of light, but I've never seen
such a perfect shadow anywhere else.'

Over his 25 expeditions to the summit in Piemonte - the highest peak in the Susa Valley - he has collected many photos of the magnificent view.

Mr Bereto, from Rivoli, in Turin, added: 'What I love about these photos is that the phenomenon is totally natural.

'No one would be surprised to see his own shadow on the sidewalk while walking in the city.

Extraordinary moment: The professional musician feels able to look at something everyday - in this case, a shadow - from an entirely different vantage point in this spot

'Shadows are just part of our daily lives. The physical process here is the same, but applied to the immensity of a mountain.

'For me this parallel between the 
ordinary and the immense leads to a sort of "rediscovery", making me 
think about the laws that govern our lives all the time.'

His two day trips - usually alone, but 
sometimes with his partner - follow the same routine of watching the 
sunset, followed by the stars and then the sunrise.

Mr Bereto, a classical organ player, 
added: 'It is absolutely quiet up there - if there is wind I hear its 
sound, but apart from that only the passage of a bird breaks the 
absolute silence.'

His aim was to catch a shadow falling across a valley, which creates the spectacular illusion of an extra mountain appearing on the horizon.
