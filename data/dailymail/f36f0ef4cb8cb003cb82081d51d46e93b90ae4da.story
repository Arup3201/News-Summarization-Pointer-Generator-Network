It’s no surprise for an international rock star to travel first class.

But there was no doubting that Brian May’s companion was a rather unusual one on this occasion.

The Queen star is said to have paid £10,000 for a second seat in the first class cabin of a British Airways flight to Los Angeles for his beloved electric guitar.

Brian May is said to have paid £10,000 for a second seat in the first class cabin of a British Airways flight to Los Angeles for his beloved electric guitar

The rocker was making the 5,500 mile journey from London to LA to perform at the Classic Rock Awards in Hollywood on Tuesday.

According to the Daily Mirror, he refused to allow the instrument to be placed in the hold with the other luggage on the flight, fearing it may get damaged.

Instead he insisted that the Red Special guitar was given an upgrade to ride with him in first class.

A source close to May, 67, told the Mirror: ‘There is no way he would have allowed it to be treated like any other piece of luggage.

May built the guitar in his father Harold’s workshop at the family home in Feltham, Middlesex, 40 years ago

‘A member of staff and the guitar were bumped up to first class where he had to purchase a seat for it as it couldn’t go in the overhead locker.

‘It was the only option so he made sure it was treated to the full VIP works. There are few things in Brian’s life that he is as passionate about as his guitar.’ 

May built the guitar in his father Harold’s workshop at the family home in Feltham, Middlesex, 40 years ago. The Red Special is credited as being a key part of Queen’s signature sound.

Queen, who recently recruited American Idol winner Adam Lambert to replace the late Freddie Mercury after the singer’s death from an Aids-related illness in November 1991, won Band of the Year at the awards on Tuesday.

After picking up the award, May said that having Lambert, 32, performing with them had given them a new lease of life.

The guitarist said: ‘We have no plans to stop, we are going to keep going for as long as we can, forever hopefully.’

A spokesman for British Airways said: 'We don’t discuss individual customers.'

 A representative for Brian May denied that the star had paid to have his guitar flown in first class, saying: 'Brian did not take his Red Special (or any guitar) to Los Angeles for the Classic Rock Awards.'
