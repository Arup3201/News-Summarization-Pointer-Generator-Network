It’s unlikely that many golfers have faced such an obstacle before on this 119-year-old course.

A fully-grown cod was discovered on a coastal golf course in Porthcawl, South Wales - which borders the Bristol Channel - following the severe storms that have hit Britain.

Peter Evans, who works for the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, found the 3ft fish on the third green of the course when he went out to clear debris.

Surprise: Peter Evans, who works for the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, found the 3ft fish on the third green

The 49-year-old told The Sun: ‘The 
tide came over onto the first fairway of the third hole. We went to 
clear up and saw this huge fish lying there.

‘It
 was a decent size - we didn't weigh it, but it looked over 12lbs. I've 
been the golf pro here for 20 years and never seen anything like it.’

The
 fish was washed to the shore as local residents defied guidance from 
the Environment Agency and police to watch huge waves strike the town’s 
seafront and harbour.

Across
 Wales, the coast was once again battered by strong winds and high tides
 today - but forecasters said the worst of the storms was over for now.

All buildings along Aberystwyth promenade were evacuated last night as it was hit by an ‘exceptional’ wave swell.

About 150 students in seafront flats were moved out to temporary accommodation at Aberystwyth University and will not return until safety checks are completed.

But strong winds and rain should ease as the weather improves this week. Natural Resources Wales said one flood warning for the lower Dee Valley and eight flood alerts remain in place.
