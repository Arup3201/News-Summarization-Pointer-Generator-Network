This is the heart-stopping moment a plane lands sideways on as a pilot battled with the strong winds battering Britain today.

The Ryanair aeroplane at Leeds Bradford airport was pictured landing awkwardly, causing a trail of smoke to stream from the wheels as it touched down on the runway.

Across the country the weather was a mixed affair, varying between strong winds, heavy and sudden downpours and beautiful spring sunshine. However, most UK families can look forward to a mild weekend and a sunny Saturday.

Three day forecast: Britain set for a sunny Saturday as rain dies out

The country woke up to some very 
blustery conditions, forecasters MeteoGroup said.

The M6 motorway was closed briefly 
between junction 8 and 10 northbound at Walsall was shut early this morning after the roof of a lorry blew off.

A stable blew across a road and residents were left without power as Cumbria was battered by winds of up to 50mph.

Police
were contacted by a farmer at about 9.50pm, who reported that his 
stable had blown across the road by the bridge at Isel, near 
Cockermouth.

He said it
had 'wedged itself' across the road, and he needed to wait until this 
morning to use heavy duty equipment to remove it.

The A66 across the Pennines remained 
closed to high-sided vehicles after Cumbria police received reports that
both a HGV and a horse box had blown over during the night in gusts of 
wind of between 46mph and 50mph.

Temperatures are expected to peak at 15C in East Anglia and London today, although in central Scotland it could be as low as 2C. There was also sporadic rain and spells of sunshine in the capital.

This weekend is again set to be warm enough to venture outside with temperatures hitting 15C.

Sally
Webb, forecaster for MeteoGroup, said: 'It will be quite breezy 
tomorrow but the winds will die off on Saturday and in the west on 
Sunday. But it will become windy again on Monday.

'Tomorrow will be mostly dry with sunny with some isolated heavy showers across the east and Midlands areas.'

She
added that the weekend will be mainly dry with some isolated showers. 
Temperatures will hit a maximum of 13C tomorrow before rising to 15C on 
Saturday and 14C on Sunday.

Northern England and central areas are likely to see the warmest weather.

Although
the country may be enjoying some belated spring weather, flower growers
are being forced to leave daffodils to rot because they have arrived 
too late to go on sale.

After weeks of freezing temperatures, frost and snow the flowers did not bloom in time for Mother's Day and Easter.

Although
they are now ready for harvest there is limited demand for daffodils in
late April so whole fields of crop will have to go to waste.

'The cold weather means the daffodils 
are way behind this year and all the varieties have flowered late,' said
Claire Taylor, who works at Taylor's Bulbs in Spalding, Lincolnshire.

'A month ago we were struggling to 
meet demand as everyone wanted daffodils for Mother's Day and Easter and
there were none around.

'Now they have appeared but the market has collapsed, orders have completely dried up and prices have fallen through the floor.

'It means there are lots of daffodils in our fields that we'll simply leave as there is no point in picking them.'

Claire, whose farm grows 400 acres of 
daffodils, said there are at least 10 varieties of daffodils on the farm
that will not be picked this year as they have flowered too late.

Spring blooms: A woman enjoys the mild weather and spring flowers in Highbury Fields, north London today

They stopped picking last weekend and the remaining flowers will now be left to die, so the nutrients go back in to the bulbs.

Despite the poor weather Claire 
said she had enjoyed a successful season because the daffodil shortage 
earlier in the year meant she was able to sell her stems for more money.

The price of daffodils went up by 50 per cent in the run up to Mother's Day because there were not enough to meet demand.

Demand for cut daffodils has collapsed as the weather improves because people are now able to go outside and do some gardening.

Other planes struggled to take off because of the weather conditions today.

Gales of 72mph were recorded at the nearby Emley 
Moor, near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in the early hours as the north
of England was hit by strong winds.

A
spokesman for the airport said there had been delays to planes flying 
to Faro, Alicante, Southampton, Barcelona, Brussels and Southampton 
because of adverse weather.

Aircraft were forced to wait until wind speed dropped and it was safe to take off before being cleared to do so as a precaution.

In the south winds of 44mph were 
recorded at Heathrow Airport.

Safe landing: The plane taxis towards the terminal after the pilot touches down successfully in the strong winds

Difficulties: Another Ryanair plane has some problems taking off in high winds but did get away successfully
