A mother from Oklahoma who had been serving a life sentence in jail for the murder of her three-month-old son has been set free after 20 years when questions arose over the reliability of the DNA evidence. 

Michelle Murphy was put behind bars in 1994, but her sentence was vacated after issues over the original DNA evidence were brought to light earlier this year. 

She was freed from prison after evidence was reviewed by a Tulsa County District Judge in May but was finally pronounced innocent on Friday. 

Free to go: Michelle Murphy, 37, seen here on the right, has been released from jail after serving 20 years of a life sentence for the murder of her three-month-old baby boy. A judge found her to be innocent 

The walk to freedom: 'I spent 20 years wrongfully in prison for something I didn't do, and I've been fighting all these years to prove that,' she said

During the hearing to examine the DNA testing and biological evidence, Judge William C. Kellough exonerated Murphy. Friday also marked the 20th anniversary of her son's death.

One of her attorney's called it 'appropriate timing.'

'I spent 20 years wrongfully in prison for something I didn't do, and I've been fighting all these years to prove that,' Murphy said to News 9. 

'The law, the facts, the evidence and the witnesses, as they exist at the present time, as well as the passing of 20 years creates a set of circumstances where the State of Oklahoma does not believe that it can meet its burden of proof at a jury trial of 'beyond a reasonable doubt,' a motion made by Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris said.

What happened next was a surprise to Murphy and her team of lawyers.

She said the judge looked at her and said, 'You're innocent.'

Hugs at last: Murphy was convicted of the 1994 murder of her 15-week-old son. His throat had been slashed and Murphy, then 17, was sent to prison for first-degree murder

Freedom! New DNA evidence, which the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office says wasn't available 20 years ago, helped overturn Murphy's conviction early in 2014

'I could do nothing but cry,' she said. 'Every day is a miracle to me. To be able to wake up in a real bed, to be able to go outside when I want to -- I can actually mourn my son now. I can maybe be privileged to know my daughter.'

The baby boy's body was found with his throat slit, almost decapitated and in a pool of blood inside Murphy's apartment in 1995. 

Murphy was just 17 years old at the time. Her other child, a two-year-old girl, was taken into protective custody when she was arrested.  

Her lawyers believe that blood at the scene that was first thought to be hers was the evidence that saw her heading to jail.

Prosecutors claimed that samples of blood at the crime scene did not belong to the baby.

However, subsequent DNA testing proved that the initial findings were incorrect. Her lawyer, Tim Harris, felt that such errors may well have affected the verdict against her. 

Murphy's attorneys filed a motion prior to her release to have the DNA evidence tested against William Lee, a key witness in the original case who committed suicide before the trial

Lee lived in the same apartment complex and was reportedly the last person to see Murphy's baby alive.

Botched investigation: Blood from the crime scene that was originally used to convict Murphy did not belong to her

Michelle Murphy was just 17 at the time of the baby's killing. She also have to give up her two-year-old daughter

Police have a 1994 taped confession of Murphy saying she leaned over her baby with a knife and accidentally killed him, but her lawyer said the confession was forced. 

It's claimed the baby was killed by 14-year-old William Lee who lived in the neighborhood and committed suicide after Murphy's preliminary trial. 

It was Lee who called 911 from a pay phone in the neighborhood the night the baby died and told operators he was reporting a domestic situation. 

Lee also later testified that he couldn't sleep and was walking around outside the apartment complex in the middle of the night when he heard Murphy and the baby's father arguing.

He claimed that through the apartment windows, he saw Murphy carry the baby from one room to another, and the next time she appeared, she had blood on her arms and the baby was in the floor in blood. 

Harris said he is a 'minister of justice,' and he felt he couldn't go forward in prosecuting Murphy further because 'Father Time has a way of taking away evidence,' the witnesses are 20 years older, and the DNA isn't that exact in this case.

'If you can't go forward in the case, you've gotta do the next right thing and move to dismiss,' Harris said.

The case was dismissed with prejudice, which prevents it from being refiled in the future. 

Murphy can, however, file a claim against the government for the handling of the case, although the compensation in Oklahoma would be capped at $175,000.

Murphy is now spending her first weekend in 20 years with her family. She is looking forward to the life ahead of her but it proud that she manage to serve her sentence.

'I can learn how to live life free without all this hanging over me,' Murphy told News On 6. 'Learn how to drive. Learn how to be independent. ...It's phenomenal. ...It was traumatic. It was very hard; it was a struggle every day. But I survived. I'm a survivor.'
