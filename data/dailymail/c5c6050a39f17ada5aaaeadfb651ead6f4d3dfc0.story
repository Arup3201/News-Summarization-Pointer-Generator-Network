Thousands of middle-class pupils have been put off going to university by the increase in tuition fees to as much as £9,000 a year.

Demand for places this autumn has fallen most sharply among sixth-formers from middle and higher-income homes following the near-trebling of fees from £3,375.

Most fail to qualify for grants, bursaries or fee discounts and must 
take out the maximum available loan to cover fees and living costs.

Just over 50,000 fewer students have applied to start degree courses from September, compared to the same point last year, according to the latest UCAS statistics.

Figures published yesterday by the Universities and Colleges Admissions 
Service reveal how 15,000 18-year-olds in England have been deterred by 
higher tuition fees.

The vast majority are from families earning at 
least £30,000 a year.

The figures suggest they are deciding in greater numbers to bypass 
university and use their A-level results to look for jobs to avoid 
building up predicted £40,000 debts.

The number of UK university 
applicants has fallen 8.9 per cent – or 50,339 – following news that 
universities will impose higher charges this autumn. In England, with 
fees considerably higher than in other home nations, demand plunged 10 
per cent.

Older students have deserted higher education in greatest numbers, with lesser falls among 18-year-old school leavers.

Drop: Overall applications, from both home and abroad, are down 7.7 per cent this year

Analysis accompanying the figures reveals that the percentage of 
18-year-olds applying from the poorest fifth of families in England has 
dipped slightly, from 19 per cent in 2011 to 18.8 per cent. These 
students’ families earn up to £15,000 before tax.

Among households earning up to £30,000, the proportion of applicants dropped 0.7 points to 26.5 per cent.

Demand dipped more sharply among  middle-income families earning between
 £30,000 and £50,000, falling 1.1 points to 32.8 per cent.

Among 
higher-earners, with household incomes of £50,000 to £75,000, the 
proportion of applicants dropped 2.1 points to 40.7 per cent.

And among 
the richest fifth of families in England, earning at least £75,000, 
demand slid 2.6 points to 53.7 per cent.

‘The application rates for young people from all backgrounds have fallen
 in 2012 with the largest declines for those from the most advantaged 
backgrounds,’ the report said.

Overall, one in 20 18-year-olds in England who would have been expected to apply to university this year has failed to do so.

In contrast, in the other UK nations where fee levels are unchanged on 
last year, application rates ‘continue on trend’.

The Mail reported 
yesterday how students from  middle-income families are expected to 
graduate with the most debt – £43,585 – according to research by the 
Institute for Fiscal Studies. They are also less likely to be eligible 
for grants after the qualifying income level was reduced from £50,695 to
 £42,600.

UCAS chief executive Mary Curnock Cook said: ‘This in-depth analysis of 
the 2012 applications data shows that, although there has been a 
reduction in application rates where tuition fees have increased, there 
has not been a disproportionate effect on more disadvantaged groups.’

The UCAS analysis presents tentative evidence that sixth-formers are 
more likely to apply to the most prestigious universities following the 
reforms, and choose courses which bring higher estimated graduate 
salaries. Many arts courses saw a decline in popularity while the 
sciences held up well.

Universities Minister David Willetts said: ‘The proportion of English 
school leavers applying to university is the second highest on record 
and people are still applying. This will still be a competitive year as 
people continue to understand that university remains a good long-term investment for their future.’
