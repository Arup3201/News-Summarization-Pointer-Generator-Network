Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has signed a new five-year contract with the Premier League champions.

News of Kompany's deal, which is understood to be worth £130,000-a-week, comes just 24 hours after David Silva also committed his future to the club until 2019.

The inspirational Belgium defender has led City to the Premier League title twice in the last three years, as well as lifting the FA Cup and Capital One Cup. And Kompany, 28, has set himself a target of adding another three titles before he leaves the Etihad.

'If you win the Premier League once, you either stop there or you want to carry on and go and win 10,' he said. 'Ten is not going to happen for me, but that's the path that I've chosen.

'I'm not happy with one or two. I want more. I want to be able to look back in my career and say that I won four or five at City. It's a tough ask, particularly when you know how difficult the league is. But it's something I'm ready to fight for every day.

'You won't see me retiring happy if at the end of my career I say I've only won two titles. Maybe five years ago that's the best I could have hoped for but now we want more. At the same time we shouldn't forget where we've come from.'

The Champions League is the next step for Manuel Pellegrini's team, and Kompany believes the current squad can become City legends by turning the club into genuine European heavyweights.

'I do know we are just at the start,' he added. 'Whoever has been building from the start will have a special place, I do know that.

Contract: The Manchester City captain will receive £130,000 a week from Manchester City

'You look around the whole club and there are signs of it being a great club to be at. We are looking to be one of the big clubs in Europe. We'll never have the history of some of those other clubs, but what I can do is build a future for us, which is just as bright if not brighter than any other club. That's the target.

'If we can keep a little bit of that in our passion, our way of dealing with the Premier League and everything we do here I think we'll be a pretty special club.

'More and more big players want to be here as well as they can see the potential and the future for this club.

'The Champions League is a big target for us. We felt last year there was not too much difference between us and the top sides.

Champion: Kompany has won two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and one League Cup with City

'We all know there are three or four sides who are a little bit above the rest. But that's the work we are doing here on the training ground, trying to bridge the gap and then trying to become stronger. It's a tough ask and it will take time but that's what we are trying to do.'

Kompany still had four years left on his current contract but City have been anxious to reward their key performers and tie them down to new deals. Silva, Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov have all re-signed in recent months and Sergio Aguero and Joe Hart are expected to be next.

The City skipper admitted that he did not need any persuading to commit the rest of his top-flight career to the club.

'To be honest I didn't have to think twice about it,' he said. 'It's just about continuity for me. I've always wanted to stay at this club for a long time.

Commitment: The Belgian defender has always demonstrated considerable commitment to the club

'Looking to the future I can see the potential – to be part of the history we've built together. It's just a natural thing for me to stay longer here and win more trophies.

'The club wants to perform on all stages. This is the best squad I've been part of and it will keep improving. I think we'll progress this year because of how comfortable we are with the system, how comfortable we are with our style of play. That will eventually make us even stronger.'

Kompany has yet to play for City in pre-season following his involvement in the World Cup, and he could only watch as the champions were beaten 3-0 by Arsenal in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday.

But he is confident City will not make the same mistake as two years ago when they won they suffered a dip in form after lifting the title and allowed Manchester United to win it back.

'The hardest thing is to win the first one,' he said. 'When it comes to retaining it, partially it's a mental thing but at the same time you get experience and you learn. In this case I feel there are a lot of red flags, alarm signals from last time, we have to be really careful not to fall into complacency.

'I'm pretty confident that's not going to happen. At the same time you have to look forward and not so much back.

'This team is stronger now than it's ever been; we have competition for places in every position and a dressing room full of exceptional, motivated people who want to continue making history together.

'Lifting two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Capital One Cup have been four of the best days of my life but I believe that there are many more of these occasions ahead.

'There are so many new landmarks and records to chase and I hope signing this new contract is taken as a statement of intent that I want to keep fighting for trophies for this special club.'
