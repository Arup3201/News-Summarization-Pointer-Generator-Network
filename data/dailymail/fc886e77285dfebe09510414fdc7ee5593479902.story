Paedophile: West Yorkshire Police insist there was no cover-up over Jimmy Savile's sex crimes

A police report clearing officers for failing to expose Jimmy Savile as a paedophile during his lifetime was yesterday dismissed by victims as a ‘cover-up and a bag of lies’.

The cosy relationship between Savile and his local force involved regular Friday coffee morning chats with officers at his flat in Leeds, along with invitations to a VIP lunch with senior officers and to open a police station gymnasium.

Despite police being contacted by Surrey colleagues in 2007 about a sexual abuse inquiry involving Savile, he was still used the following year to front two crime prevention campaigns in his home city.

Savile even offered the use of his home to police controlling crowds at a Robbie Williams concert in a nearby park, the report revealed.

The internal inquiry by West Yorkshire Police investigated alarming allegations about missed chances to expose the celebrity DJ over several decades.

They included claims a police officer knew about rumours of Savile taking girls to a barge for parties during the 1960s and that the vice squad investigated Savile during the 1980s for indecent assaults on two girls as well as being aware of rumours he was a ‘pervert’.

Savile himself recalled an incident in his personal diary of how a police officer visited his club in Leeds one night and spoke to him about a teenage girl ‘absconder’.

If she turned up he promised to return the girl but ‘keep her all night first as a reward’.

Savile wrote that he did take her to police the next day and implied  officers failed to challenge him because of his close relationship with the force. The report team could find ‘no records’ to back this account.

The report concluded: ‘There is no 
evidence that he was protected from arrest or prosecution for any 
offences as a result of his relationship with WYP, or individual 
friendships with officers.’

The review team ‘did find mistakes 
were made in how WYP recorded and handled some intelligence relating to 
Savile’, and added: ‘WYP has been unable to fully establish all the 
facts.’

Although several matters have been 
referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, several of 
Savile’s victims condemned the  59-page report.

A 52-year-old man, who was attacked 
by Savile when he was a teenager, said: ‘There is clearly a cover-up 
going on.

'The police knew what was happening and were protecting him at 
the time.

‘The police are now running around 
like headless chickens trying to appear as though they are acting on 
these allegations but the fact of the matter is something should have 
been done a long time ago.

‘I hope no one believes for a second what is published in that report. It’s a complete whitewash.’

A 56-year-old woman, who Savile tried
to rape at a party when she was 19, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned the 
report is nothing more than a bag of lies.

'I find it impossible to 
believe it wasn’t covered up by those he worked with and by the police.’

Alan Collins, a lawyer representing 
40 victims, accused police of having ‘collective myopia’ and said the 
report ‘doesn’t add up’.

Temporary West Yorkshire Assistant 
Chief Constable Ingrid Lee admitted police had ‘let the victims down.’

She added: ‘The police are not infallible, the police are human beings.’

Host: Many officers attended coffee mornings at Savile's flat in Leeds, the report said

Nine of Jimmy Savile's West Yorkshire victims were under 10 at the time and one of them was only five.

As part of today's report, West Yorkshire Police analysed the characteristics of the 68 victims who have come forward in the force area so far.

These victims have reported 76 crimes between them, 72 of them taking place in Savile's home city of Leeds.

The youngest victim was five and the eldest was 45.

The report said nine victims were under 10; nine victims were 10 to 13 years old; 30 were aged 14 to 17; and 20 were adults.

Of the 68 complainants, 49 were female and 19 were male.

Most of the offending took place in the 1960s and 70s but two claims related to the 1950s and three were made in the 2000s.

Of these offences, eight were alleged rapes.

Four of these complainants were women but four were men.

Other offences detailed by his victims have been recorded as sexual assault, sexual activity with a child, indecent exposure and common assault.

Investigation: Ingrid Lee took charge of the review of Savile's relationship with West Yorkshire Police

Jimmy Savile's details were recorded as part of the hunt to find the Yorkshire Ripper, in the 1970s, but no evidence has been found that he was a 'person of interest' to the inquiry.

Questions were raised about the broadcaster's relationship with the Ripper investigation last year when a retired senior officer claimed the disgraced DJ was a suspect in the notorious case more than 30 years ago.

But today's report from West Yorkshire Police concluded it could find no evidence of this being true.

The review found that many records have been destroyed, but detectives had found huge numbers of record cards with information about thousands of men who had been spoken to.

The report said: 'Searches of the paperwork relating to the investigation have identified four index cards relating to Savile. They contain scant information and do not indicate whether Savile was a "person of interest" to the enquiry team.

'The information held was his name, date of birth, home address and various reference numbers. It was not possible to establish the relevance of the reference numbers as a large proportion of the investigation paperwork had been destroyed in the 1980s.'

But the review said: 'One card does make reference to Savile offering his services as an intermediary for the police, should the "Ripper" wish to make contact.'
