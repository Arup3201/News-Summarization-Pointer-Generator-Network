Holding her new puppy in her arms, Teresa Walton popped into the local dog grooming parlour to ask about the cost of keeping him in tip-top shape.

But moments after she arrived at the shop, her beloved pet was dead – savaged by the parlour owner’s two vicious dogs which had been allowed to roam free.

As a frantic Mrs Walton threw herself over the pup she called ‘my baby’, parlour owner Karen Creasey tried desperately to pull her two dogs away.

Teresa Walton's cockapoo puppy Cooper was only 13 weeks old when he died after a bull mastiff attack

But the women were no match for the snarling attackers and the 13-week-old cockapoo pup Cooper had no chance.

Last night Mrs Walton, 46, and her 
husband Terry, 52, spoke of their horror at losing their pet and their 
fears that it could have been so much worse.

‘We are never going to be able to 
replace him but we will fight for justice for Cooper,’ Mr Walton said. 
‘It could so easily have been a woman carrying a baby.’

Mrs Creasey, who was appalled at the 
attack, said she had since closed her business, K9 Cutz, and planned to 
have her dogs, thought to be bull mastiffs, destroyed.

The Waltons had bought Cooper – a 
cross between a cocker spaniel and a poodle – in December. Their 
23-year-old son had left home and their previous dog had died. It was 
the perfect time to welcome a new pup.

Wanting to spoil her new pet, Mrs 
Walton walked to K9 Cutz  in Weston, Lincolnshire, to ask about the cost
of their treatments. She knocked on the door but when it opened the two
mastiffs ran out and savaged Cooper to death.

Mrs Walton then called the police, while desperately trying to keep the dogs from tearing Cooper’s body apart.

Choking back tears, she said: ‘He was 
such a little character. Our son has just left home and Cooper became 
our new baby. The woman really tried to get them off but she couldn’t 
control them.

‘She was calling the dogs off and then she laid over Cooper and I went down on to the floor with his head tucked under my arm.

‘I didn’t want them to eat him. The 
dogs were still circling and sniffing around. I have hardly slept since 
because as soon as I fall asleep I relive it all.’

Mrs Walton, who now has her arm in a 
sling after hurting it as she wrestled with the dogs, phoned her 
husband, who rushed to the shop.

The Waltons took the body of Cooper, a cross between a cocker spaniel and a poodle, home in a blanket and buried him in their back garden after the attack by the mastiffs, similar to that pictured left

‘I saw Teresa carrying Cooper and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. He was a mess,’ he said.

‘We took him home wrapped in his blanket and buried him in the back garden.’

Mrs Creasey, 43, who has run the parlour for six years, said she was ‘distraught and devastated’ at the attack.

She claimed she allowed the mastiffs 
to run free indoors because the shop had closed for the day but Mrs 
Walton insists it was still open.

A sign outside warned visitors that the dogs might be off  their leashes.

Sobbing, she said: ‘I was physically 
kicking them and hitting them and trying to get them off her dog. I laid
down on her dog to stop them attacking it, but there was nothing I 
could do.

‘I am distraught by what happened. I 
have closed the business and the dogs are going to be destroyed.’ Police
said they were investigating.
