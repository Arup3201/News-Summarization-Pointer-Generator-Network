The government shut-down is having an unforeseen effect on NFL player Donte Whitner, who announced via Twitter last week that he's legally changing his surname to Hitner following what he says are unfair NFL fines for illegal hits.

Whitner, a safety for the San Francisco 49ers, wants his Nike football jersey to read 'Hitner' for his next game - but he's going to wait, since the shutdown means his name-change won't be processed for at least a month.

Whitner's vowed to legally change his name to Hitner after the NFL fined him $21,00 for an illegal hit on a St. Louis Rams player earlier this season.

Shut down: Donte will remain a Whitner until at least November

His plans to drop the W from his last name were scuppered by NFL officials, who require a player to legally change his moniker before wearing a jersey emblazoned with it.

The name-change could prove costly, too: according to TMZ, Nike requires a player to buy up any remaining inventory featuring the old name.

That means Whiter, as Hitner, would have to buy all the unsold jerseys with his name on them before the company would begin producing new Hitner versions.

But according to the Bleacher Report, the cost might not deter Whitner - he's due to earn $3.8 million this year.

The would-be Hitner took to Twitter yesterday to vent his frustration: 'Damn gov't shutdown lol GM,' he wrote.Â 

By the estimation of Deadspin, the soonest Whitner could be on-field in a Hitner jersey is the November 17 game against the Saints.

But it could be a lot longer: Chad Johnson had to wait a year to put 'Ochocinco' on the back of his jersey, due to contractual obligations with Reebok.

The Ohio native seems to be taking the setback in-stride, and maintains the name-change will go ahead:

'If you ask the fans around San Francisco, the Bay Area, or anyone 
that's a fan of me, they call me Donte Hitner any way,' he told 49ers.com.

'Everything we do is for the fans right? It's all entertainment. We all 
understand that. It's entertainment, but that's what I do, it's my game.
Along with some things that happened recently, that's why I went with 
it.'
