Exactly 30 years after a 22-year-old college student who was dating actor-director Robert Redford's daughter was discovered dead from a gunshot wound to the head, Colorado police believe they may be one step closer to making an arrest in the cold case.

Boulder police issued a statement Wednesday saying they're looking for Thayne Smika, who is still being sought after a murder warrant was issued for his arrest in 2010. They're seeking the public's help on the 30th anniversary of Sid Wells' death.

Wells' brother found his body August 1, 1983, in Wells' Spanish Towers condominium. An autopsy showed Wells was shot execution-style at point-blank range in the back of the head with a 20-guage shotgun.

Victim: University of Colorado journalism student Sid Wells, 22, was gunned down August 1, 1983, in his condominium

The case attracted worldwide media attention when Redford halted production of The Natural, being filmed on location in Buffalo, N.Y., and came to Boulder for Wells' funeral.

Wells and Redford's daughter Shauna, then 22 years old, were both students at the University of Colorado and lived in the same building.

Smika, who was often late with rent, was supposed to pay Wells the day he was killed, investigators said.

Police suspected Smika, Wells' roommate, and arrested him a few months after investigators said they linked him to the murder. Smika was never prosecuted because the district attorney at the time declined to take the case.

Smika left the area, and in 1986 his abandoned car was found in Beverly Hills, Calif.

Wells' mother, June Menger, said Thursday that Boulder investigators have been dogged in their work to solve the case.

Sensless loss: Wells aspired to be a journalist, was a dedicated student and had many friends 

She said she isn't bitter about the delays in getting a murder warrant. Prosecutors at the time of the killing lacked the evidence techniques that have since allowed detectives to link shotgun pellets recovered from Wells' body to shells found at the Smika family residence in Akron, Menger said.

She said Robert Redford and her son were friends, and they went jogging and skiing together.

She said Redford initially decided not to attend the funeral, worried it would become a media circus. But he came anyway because of his close friendship with Wells.

‘He said it had turned into his nightmare too,’ she said.

Redford said in 1997 that Wells' murder still haunted him.

‘It's like a partially opened door with a very dark room behind it,’ he said.

Prime suspect: Smika, Wells' roommate, was arrested a few months after the murder, but he was never prosecuted because the district attorney at the time declined to take the case

In 2010, the Boulder County district attorney's office agreed to review the case and approved an arrest affidavit for Smika. But authorities could not find him. Smika's bail was set at $5million after the warrant was issued.

Boulder Deputy Police Chief Dave Hayes, one of the first detectives to investigate the case, said Smika may have become assimilated into a community and he hopes new coverage of the case will lead a neighbor or a relative to step forward.

‘It's time for justice,’ said Hayes, who has remained in touch with Wells' family over the last three decades.

Thayne Smika, who is believed to be living under an assumed identity, would be 54 now. Police released his 1983 mugshot and an age-progressed image of what he might look like today.

Bereaved: Shauna Redford dated Sid Wells for three years, was his best friends, and in his obituary she was listed among his survivors

In 1997, a police officer posing as a journalism student talked to Smika's mother, who said her son had changed his name because he was afraid for his life because he knew who the real killer was.

An aspiring journalist, Wells also was part of the university’s Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. For his first date with Shauna Redford, the two went to an ROTC dance, the site Daily Camera reported.

Shauna, the daughter of Robert Redford and his first wife, Lola Van Wagenen, whom he divorced in 1985, dated Sid Wells for three years, and in his obituary she was listed among his survivors.

Moving on: Shauna, pictured left with her actor-director father in 1997, went on to marry journalist and best-selling author Eric Schlosser (right), and the couple have two children

A photo that accompanied a 1983 Associated Press article about Wells’ funeral showed the weeping young woman being comforted by her father on their way to the service.

Following the murder, Shauna went on to marry university professor Eric Schlosser, the best-selling author of Fast Food Nation. The couple have two children, a boy and a girl.
