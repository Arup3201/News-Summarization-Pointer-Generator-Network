It wasn’t quite the perfect landing he was anticipating.

Arms and legs flailing helplessly, this paraglider might have felt like dying of embarrassment...if it hadn’t been for a far more realistic threat to his life.

He was dangling from wires carrying 11,000 volts and said later he could feel the current rushing through his body as he came perilously close to being electrocuted.

For ten minutes the pilot battled frantically to free himself, all the time fearing he was about to receive a fatal shock.

He eventually managed to free himself and leapt to the ground with burns only to his right hand and leg to show for the ordeal...though he also managed to black out local homes for an hour as the power was cut.

The 30-year-old businessman, who is so embarrassed by the incident he would give his name only as Daniel, said he feared for his life after misjudging the landing in March, Cambridgeshire.

‘I was coming in to land, following a friend. I came over low and then found the lines in front of me. I just didn’t see them.

‘We had a safety briefing before, and it was totally my fault.

‘My leg got caught on the line, but I managed to release myself and get clear from the lines. By then I was only a few feet from the ground, so I jumped down. It was scary. I feared for my life and I continually thought I was going to be electrocuted.’

Daniel, who has six years’ experience in power paragliding, spent Sunday night under observation in the burns unit at Chelmsford Hospital in Essex but returned home the following day.

Nigel Davies, 45, who runs the Fenland Wind and Airsports Centre, where Daniel was attempting to land, said the crash was a ‘freak accident’. He said: ‘We have been here for seven years, and this is the first accident we have had.’

Brian Dobson, 50, who captured Daniel’s plight on camera, said: ‘He was up there for a good ten minutes. He said he could feel electricity coming through his body.

‘If anyone had touched him they would
have got a shock. He managed to free himself and the emergency services
arrived five minutes later.’ Some 45 homes lost power as a result of 
the crash but their supply was restored later the same evening.

Despite his ordeal, Daniel plans to return to paragliding soon.

He said: ‘I’ve had a setback but I 
can’t wait to get back in the air. It is a great sport with great people
and a great community. It really brings people together.’
