Baby steps: Teddy appears calm in front of the camera - here at 16 weeks old he is seen crawling along

Teddy appears calm in front of the camera. At ten weeks old he cracks a big grin for his audience while wearing a cute cable knit sweater.

Then, six weeks later, he begins to start crawling. 

At seven and a half months old Teddy is heard making sounds. He also starts wobbling around on two legs.

A month later - armed with his baby set of teeth - he appears to try Cheerios for the first time. 

He gives the breakfast cereal a thumbs up, with a big smile and his arms ecstatically lifted in the air.

By 11 months old Teddy is completely confident on two feet as he chases Mavis the pet dog around.  

A year of smiles: Teddy appears to be a happy child in the video, with a big grin from ear to ear

Dressed to impressed: The infant models an impressive spread of outfits in the video

Early learning: Teddy plays with letter-shaped building blocks as Mavis the dog sits near by
