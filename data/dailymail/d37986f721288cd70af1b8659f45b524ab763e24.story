Confusion: Harriet Harman, pictured during her speech at the Labour conference, made an embarrassing radio gaffe today

Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman appeared to back defeated Miliband brother David for prime minister today in an embarrassing slip during a radio interview.

She immediately corrected herself and said she hoped that Ed Miliband, who beat elder brother David to the leadership, would spend 10 years at Number 10.

The mistake comes as the two brothers are still under intense scrutiny for any signs of rivalry or ill-feeling after last year's bruising leadership contest.

Asked on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour whether she thought Labour would have a female leader within the next decade, Ms Harman said: 'Well I hope we can get David...'

Cutting herself off as she began to say 'elected', she paused briefly before going on: 'I hope we will get Ed Miliband elected as prime minister for the next election and then he will be 10 years as Prime Minister, so not in the next 10 years, no.'

Despite having the most support among MPs, MEPs and rank-and-file party members, David lost the election to succeed Gordon Brown after his younger brother swept up votes among the unions.

Until then, Ed had always been junior to his elder brother in the Labour hierarchy.

At this year's party conference David has attended only one event, and he will be in the U.S. while Ed makes his leadership speech tomorrow.

Spot the difference: Ms Harman confused Labour leader Ed, right, with his elder brother David

While setting out the case for the Labour leader and deputy leader duo always to include a woman, Ms Harman said she wanted the top role to be occupied by the present leader for the next decade.

'I want our current leader to succeed and he's a man,' she said.

Asked who she thought might be Labour's first woman leader, she refused to say.

'It's like asking a woman, "Who is going to be your second husband?" If you are still on your first you don't want to discuss the second one,' Ms Harman said.

'It's just not a conversation you can have.'
