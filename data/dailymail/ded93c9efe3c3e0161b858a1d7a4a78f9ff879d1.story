Spy time: A Christie's staff member holds the the Breitling Top Time, worn by Sean Connery in the 1965 movie Thunderball. It was bought for £25 at a car boot sale and sold at auction for more than £100,000

A watch bought at a car boot sale for £25 which turned out to be a one-off worn by Sean Connery in the James Bond film Thunderball has fetched an eye-watering £103,875 at auction

The Breitling Top Time, worn in the 1965 Bond film, was snapped up at the car boot sale by an eagle-eyed bargain hunter.

Clocking that they had bought something special, the buyer, who wants to remain anonymous, took the watch to an expert to be valued and was shocked to hear it was worth an estimated £30,000 to £60,000.

But at an auction at Christie’s today the timepiece smashed this estimate and sold to a telephone bidder for £103,875.

The watch featured during 007’s mission to find two NATO atomic bombs stolen by SPECTRE in Thunderball.

It was the first watch to be modified by the famous Q Branch and is equipped with a Geiger counter, which detects the emission of nuclear radiation in the film.

Made by Breitling in 1962, it was adapted by the James Bond art department and is one of a kind.

Nicolette Tomkinson, head of the popular culture department at Christie’s in London, said: 'We are pleased to be involved with the sale of this important modified timepiece from Thunderball, which holds a significant place in the history of James Bond.

'Not only was it the first ever modified gadget watch issued by ‘Q’ branch to James Bond, it was also the only ‘Q’ gadget watch to be worn by Sean Connery.

'The Bond art department commissioned a small tool company to manufacture a bespoke ‘water resistant Geiger counter’ case for the 1962 Breitling ‘Top Time’ timepiece, which Bond uses in various scenes in the film to check the radioactive count in search of two NATO atomic bombs stolen by SPECTRE.

'Lost since filming, the watch has only recently been rediscovered, and must be considered a rare and unique trophy for the Bond collector and the watch aficionado alike.'

The watch was the first to be adapted by the boffins at MI6. Watches with secret gadgets attached went on to become a staple of the franchise
