Tragedy: Six-year-old Jack Adcock died from pneumonia after a doctor mistook him for another child with a 'do not resuscitate order'

A boy of six died after a hospital doctor mixed him up with another child who was subject to a ‘do not resuscitate’ order, an inquest heard.

Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba admitted she stopped staff who were trying to save Jack Adcock’s life and said she had not bothered to check his identity.

The paediatric registrar said: ‘I should have checked the face before stopping.

‘But I had been working for 12 hours with no break.’

Jack, who had Down’s syndrome, was admitted to the Leicester Royal Infirmary with breathing difficulties, a raised temperature and high heart rate.

His condition deteriorated and he suffered a cardiac arrest.

Dr Bawa-Garba, 36, admitted she was ‘not on top of things’ having recently returned from 13 months of maternity leave.

She said that during her time off work, she had become ‘deskilled in the management and treatment of shock’, failed to recognise Jack was in shock and failed to recognise his ‘grossly abnormal’ blood results.

A ‘do not resuscitate’ order on a patient’s file means that a doctor is not required to revive a patient if their heart stops. They are issued after discussions with parents or their family.

They are designed to prevent unnecessary suffering, for example if a patient’s condition is such that resuscitation is unlikely to succeed or if successful resuscitation would lead to a poor quality of life.

But Jack’s mother Nicola Adcock, 39, described him as a ‘tough little cookie’ and confirmed a ‘do not resuscitate’ order had never been placed on him.

Dr Bawa-Garba confused  Jack with 
another youngster  on the same ward who was subject to a ‘do not 
resuscitate’ order,  the inquest at Leicester Town Hall heard.

Jack died of pneumonia in the hospital
on February 18, 2011, the same day he was admitted, after Dr Bawa-Garba
interrupted attempts to resuscitate him. Asked by Leicester Coroner 
Catherine Mason whether she actually saw Jack’s face before telling 
staff to stop, Dr Bawa-Garba said: ‘There were a lot of people in the 
room and I can’t remember if I saw a face or not.

‘But what was important to me was not to resuscitate a child that was not to be resuscitated.’

She realised her mistake only when 
another doctor asked her: ‘Why is Jack not for resuscitation?’ Dr 
Bawa-Garba then shouted: ‘He is for resus – it’s the wrong patient,’ the
inquest heard.

As soon as she realised her mistake, 
she returned to Jack and tried to treat him as part of a team of medics 
who battled for nearly an hour to resuscitate him, but were 
unsuccessful.

She was also questioned about why she had telephoned Jack’s mother two days after his death.

Dr Bawa-Garba told the inquest it was 
‘just out of courtesy’ and claimed she only later found out from the 
hospital trust that she was not meant to.

Yesterday Mrs Adcock and her husband 
Victor Adcock, 47, of  Glen Parva, Leicester, who also have a younger 
daughter, listened as the inquest was told how the ‘crash team’ was 
called when Jack went into cardiac arrest at about 7.45pm. His mother 
had been at his bedside and it was she who first asked for help.

Staff nurse Katherine Ramsden wept as 
she told how doctors ‘came running’ and began trying to resuscitate 
Jack, but then Dr Bawa-Garba told them to stop. She said: ‘It was very 
overwhelming. I tried to save him and I couldn’t.’

The inquest, expected to last another four days, continues.

Do Not Resuscitate orders would 
normally be issued when resuscitation will not restart the heart or 
breathing, will be of no benefit to the patient, or when the burdens are
outweighed by the benefits. Guidelines issued by the British Medical 
Association and the Royal College of Nursing require discussion with 
patients or their  family before the orders can be made.

They can be made if resuscitation is 
unlikely to succeed; if a mentally competent patient has consistently 
asked not to be resuscitated, or has said so in their will; or if 
resuscitation would lead to poor quality of life.

The process of keeping patients 
breathing can be violent and cause trauma to patients, such as broken 
ribs, other fractures, a ruptured spleen or brain damage.
