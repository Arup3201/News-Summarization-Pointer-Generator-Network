Fans of the new John Lewis Christmas advert have already gone on a shopping spree with the £95 toy penguin getting  sold out online within hours of its release.

The retailer only released its latest festive commercial this morning but stars Monty and Mabel have already proved to be a huge hit despite the high prices.

John Lewis has released 39 different pieces of new penguin merchandise linked to its £7million Christmas campaign, but much of it is selling out fast. 

Other items, including the Monty and Mabel pyjamas, onesie, umbrella and cufflinks are already sold out according to the John Lewis website.

This year's John Lewis Christmas ad tells the story of seven-year-old Sam, left, and his penguin friend Monty 

This year's two-minute festive commercial tells the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by seven-year-old Rhys Edwards, and his friend Monty. 

The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel. 

Throughout the advert Monty is a CGI penguin, but at the end it is revealed to be a stuffed toy - and for a few hours you could buy him and his girlfriend online in various sizes for between £12 and £95.

But they are still available in stores. 

A John Lewis spokesman told MailOnline: 'Yes we are expecting more stock and all items are still available in all of our shops'. 

Monty and Mabel toys jewellery, Christmas cards, jumpers, hot water bottle and even artwork are available in store and online.

Other Items includes a children's book called Monty's Christmas, of which a proportion of the proceeds will go to Barnardo's, stuffed toys, an umbrella and pyjamas. 

But shoppers outside John Lewis's Oxford Street branch seemed unconvinced.

Dedi Chinanurakchart, a 21-year-old student, said: 'If it was a real penguin I probably would have bought it because I've always wanted one. Why is it so pricy? Is it stuffed with gold?'

Malik Kydd, 19, also complained about the price: 'If that's the thing that they are promoting in the advert it shouldn't cost so much - because John Lewis is (usually) an accessible store for everybody.'

Similarly, Daneika March, 24, and Natalie Baker, 38, who work at House of Fraser, enjoyed the family-focused feel to the ad, but Ms Baker said she would not be swayed by the £95 Monty toy.

'I think it's £9.50 for a bear in John Lewis at the moment, so I wouldn't buy a £95 Monty.'

His and hers: These jerseys for boys and girls are for sale for £12 to £14 each depending on the sizes

Work of art: This print of Monty and Mabel is designed is perfect for a lounge and bedroom, and is priced at £25

However, Craig Whaites, 42, head of training at the Co-Operative, had just bought one for his 16-year-old daughter, Sarah, in the retailer's Oxford Street store.

'It makes you feel like it's Christmas,' he said.

Thomas  Connelly tweeted: 'You can buy Monty the Penguin for £95 from @johnlewisretail! He's bloody staying single at that price'.

Gill Edwards wrote: 'Just been checking out Monty the penguin toys, £95 for a 35 cm stuffed toy is outrageous. suddenly the advert has gone flat for me'.  

Price range: Also available are gift bags for £3.50, as well as a light for £25 and slippers for £15
