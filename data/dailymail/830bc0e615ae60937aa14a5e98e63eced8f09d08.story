Eleven care home employees were last night being held over the manslaughter of an elderly woman who died days after the property was shut down by inspectors.

Ivy Atkin, 86, died in November last year, a fortnight after an inspection by the Care Quality Commission found ‘multiple examples of neglectful care’ at her care home.

Inspectors had gone into the Autumn Grange home in Sherwood Rise, Nottingham, which specialised in dementia care, on November 2 after concerns were raised over residents’ welfare.

Probe: Ivy Atkin, 86, died after she was moved from Autumn Grange residential home following its closure

They discovered residents with 
unexplained injuries including head wounds, skin tears that needed 
stitching, and bruised and swollen hands.

One resident was found lying on a bed 
‘covered in urine and  faecal matter’, another had a catheter bag so 
full of urine it kept falling off and other elderly residents were found
in the same clothing they had been wearing for several days.

Inspectors shut the home and called in the police, and 30 older people, including Ivy Atkin, were immediately re-housed.

Police are investigating whether Mrs 
Atkin’s death two weeks later at another care home was a result of 
failings in her care at Autumn Grange.

Nottinghamshire Police said five men 
aged between 37 and 77, and six women aged between 19 and 52, had been 
detained on suspicion of manslaughter.

Shut: Autumn Grange care home was closed due to serious concerns about the standard of care of residents

All were either staff members or managers at Autumn Grange.

Mrs Atkin, a widowed former 
dressmaker, had been moved to Autumn Grange last summer when she became 
unable to cope in the bungalow where she had lived for more than 50 
years.

'She had lost weight and had bed sores'

Relative of Ivy Atkin

One of Mrs Atkin’s few surviving relatives told the Daily Mail that the family believed she had been mistreated.

The source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘She had lost weight and had bed sores.’

The relative said Mrs Atkin, who was 
suffering from dementia, had worked as a factory machinist. Her husband 
of 58 years, Kenneth, worked in a lemonade factory. He died four years 
ago and the  couple had no children.

Former neighbour Ben Briggs said yesterday Mrs Atkin had ‘gone downhill’ following the death of her husband.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
