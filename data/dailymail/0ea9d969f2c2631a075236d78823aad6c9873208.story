A posh  waterfront restaurant at the Gold Coast could face heavy fines after food inspectors allegedly found cockroaches in the kitchen.

Live and dead cockroaches were located in the storage area and near the pizza oven at Saks restaurant at Main Beach, court documents revealed.

Food inspectors allege to have also found uncovered food containers, including some with raw seafood, as well as dirt, mould and grease during the September inspection, the Courier Mail reports.

Gold Coast Council issued Saks with a breach notice and the restaurant's owner pleaded guilty to the cockroach claims.

The case will be heard at Southport Magistrates Court on Wednesday where it's believed the owners could be given a heavy fine.

Saks is believed to have been given a 'clean bill of health' when food inspectors carried out a routine follow-up inspection.
