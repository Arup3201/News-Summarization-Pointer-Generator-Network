Police have identified the suspect who allegedly shot a police officer eye during a vehicle stop, sending him into a coma where he's now fighting for his life.

Officer John Moynihan, 34, was attacked when he pulled over suspected gang members in Boston, Massachusetts, on Friday evening.

The suspect, identified as 41-year-old Angelo West, was shot dead by other officers at the scene in Boston on Friday evening after he opened fire. A female bystander was shot in the arm.

West allegedly shot Moynihan 'point blank' and emptied his revolver in the unprovoked attack, police said, according to the Boston Globe.

Boston Police Commissioner William Evans spoke on Saturday during a press conference. He said West emptied his revolver of bullets

None of the officers had drawn their guns when West opened fire, Suffolk DA Dan Conley said at a press conference.  

Now in a critical condition in Boston Medical Center, Officer Moynihan is a highly decorated military veteran awarded a medal for bravery by President Obama for his involvement in a shoot-out with the Boston Bombing suspects.

He was shot just below his right eye and placed in an induced coma fighting for his life at a hospital, police Commissioner William Evans said.

Crime scene tape blocked off two or three blocks in every direction, and police vehicles were scattered throughout after Friday's shooting

He is on the police Youth Violence Task Force, Evans said.

Other officers returned fire and killed the suspect at the scene, Evans said. A woman at the scene suffered a flesh wound to her right arm and was in good spirits, and three other officers were taken to a hospital with stress-related problems, he said.

'The officer here is in tough shape, but we're all pulling for him, and hopefully he'll pull through,' Evans said. 'His family's with him, the clergy has been here and ... let's pray for him.'

Evans said Moynihan is undergoing tests there is being monitored for bleeding in his brain. 

'We are hoping and praying there's not further damage,' he said.

Evans said the police officers were watching the vehicle before pulling it over. He did not say why the officers stopped the vehicle. One of three people in the car got out, opened fire on the officers and was killed, he said.

Police were interviewing the other two people in the car, and it was too early to say whether criminal charges would be filed against them, he said.

Such shootings are rare in Boston, but firearms are a major concern in the city, the commissioner said.

'We've got way too many guns out there, way too many young kids running around with the guns,' he said, 'and unfortunately this is what happens.'

Mayor Marty Walsh said his thoughts and prayers were with the injured officer, his family and the police department.

'These acts of violence have no place in our neighborhoods,' Walsh said. 'Our community is stronger than ever, and tonight we are thankful for all of those who put their lives on the on the line every day to protect our city.'
