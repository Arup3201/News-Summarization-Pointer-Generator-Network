President Obama allegedly threatened Speaker John Boehner with a public shaming if he held up a compromise on the fiscal cliff negotiations.

Mr Obama reportedly said that he was willing to blame the failed negotiations on stubborn Republicans in either his inauguration speech or the state of the Union if the two parties were unable to reach an equitable decision.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Mr Obama made the threat a number of times, and though nothing has been formally decided as the deadline looms one week from today, the move would be a drastic one, and seen by many as a divisive way to head into his second term.

Not happy with threats: President Obama reportedly grew frustrated with Speaker John Boehner and said that if they didn't strike a deal he would blame the Republicans in his Inaugural address

One of the points where President Obama became frustrated with Mr Boehner came when the Speaker said that he expected some show of gratitude or concession after he reportedly handed over $800billion from tax revenue earnings.

That was promptly shot down by the President, with him allegedly retorting: 'You get nothing. I get that for free.'

On Capitol Hill, some Republicans worry about the practical and political implications should the GOP block a compromise designed to avoid tax increases for most Americans and cut the nation's deficit.

'It weakens the entire Republican Party, the Republican majority,' Representative Steven LaTourette, a Republican from Ohio, said Thursday night shortly after rank-and-file Republicans rejected Boehner's 'Plan B' - a measure that would have prevented tax increases on all Americans but million-dollar earners.

'I mean it's the continuing dumbing down of the Republican Party and we are going to be seen more and more as a bunch of extremists that can't even get a majority of our own people to support policies that we're putting forward,' LaTourette said.

'If you're not a governing majority, you're not going to be a majority very long.'

Republicans are not the only ones bracing for a less-than-stellar situation, as President Obama has reportedlyÂ  scaled back his ambitions for a sweeping budget bargain with 
Republicans.

Instead, he's calling for a limited measure sufficient to 
prevent the government from careening off the 'fiscal cliff' in January 
by extending tax cuts for most taxpayers and forestalling a painful set 
of agency budget cuts.

In a White House 
appearance Friday, Obama also called on Congress to extend jobless 
benefits for the long-term unemployed that would otherwise be cut off 
for 2 million people at the end of the year.

The future looked bright: The pair met in November, and were seemingly happy, but the same cannot be said now

Obama's
announcement was a recognition that chances for a larger agreement 
before year's end have probably collapsed.

It also suggested that any 
chance for a smaller deal may rest in the Senate, particularly after the
collapse of a plan by Speaker Boehner to permit tax
rates to rise on million-dollar-plus incomes.

'In the next few days,
I've asked leaders of Congress to work toward a package that prevents a
tax hike on middle-class Americans, protects unemployment insurance for
2 million Americans, and lays the groundwork for further work on both 
growth and deficit reduction,' President Obama said.

Speaker of the House John Boehner, (left) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (right with the president) must compromise together along with President Obama on the looming 'fiscal cliff'

'That's an achievable goal. 
That can get done in 10 days.'

Maybe, maybe 
not. The latest plan faces uncertainty at best in the sharply divided 
Senate. GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who wields great power 
even in the minority, called Friday for Senate action on a House bill 
from the summer extending the full menu of Bush-era tax cuts.

He 
promised that it will take GOP votes for anything to clear the Senate, 
where 60 votes are required to advance most legislation. Democrats 
control 53 votes.

Boehner, giving the GOP 
weekly radio address, said, 'Of course, hope springs eternal, and I know
we have it in us to come together and do the right thing.'
