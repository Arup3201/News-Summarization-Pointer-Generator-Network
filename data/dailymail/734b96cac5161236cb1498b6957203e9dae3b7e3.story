She is the face of millions of unemployed Americans trying everything they can to get back into the job market.

Elizabeth Romanaux, 55, had to put on a brave face as she worked as an unpaid intern for a public relations firm in New Jersey earlier this year.

The former media relations manager has been building contact lists and fetching lunches as she tries to boost chances of full employment again.

Trying everything: Elizabeth Romanaux, 55, had to put on a brave face as she worked as an intern for a public relations firm in New Jersey

Ms Romanaux is one of many older Americans struggling to find jobs and keep their skills up to date in the worst labour market in decades.

Internships were once the domain of high school and college students - but older workers are trying to build up their resume in between jobs.

‘You have to suck it up sometimes and do what a 17-year-old would happily do and be happy about it,’ Ms Romanaux said.

Margo Rose, founder of online job search advice website HireFriday, said lots of adults laid off are looking for new ways to improve their CV.

She said: ‘The last thing you want to do is look the interviewer in the eye with a blank stare when they ask you: “What have you been doing for the last year?”’

Careers advisor Liz Ryan said she had never been approached by mid-career clients seeking help securing an internship before 2008.

‘There has definitely been almost an explosion of this kind of thing,’ she explained. ‘In 2008, I had about 20 of them.’

That increased to 36 annually in 2009 and 2010, Ms Ryan said.

Ms Ryan says Will Smith's 2006 movie ‘The Pursuit of Happyness’ may have contributed to the uptick in post-college-age interns.

In the film, Mr Smith's character loses everything in a get-rich-quick scheme selling bone density scanners.

But in a Hollywood twist, he lands a stock brokerage internship, which, after six gruelling months, turns into a job.

Phil Gardner, who analyses initial employment at Michigan State University, said the number of graduates taking internships ‘ballooned last year’.

But it did ease off as the labour market improved earlier this year.

College internships did not take off until the 1970s, when baby boomers flooded universities. 

From 1970 to 1983, the number of colleges and universities offering internship programs increased from 200 to 1,000.

‘If I could get someone like me for free, I would be apologetic about it, but I would do it'

The rising number of older interns now represents a broader crisis in the labour market in which job seekers cannot get the kind of work they want.

While the unemployment rate ticked up to 9.1 per cent in May, almost 16 per cent of Americans were ‘underemployed’ in the same month.

This means they were either out of work but looking, working part-time involuntarily or discouraged from searching for a job.

Labour Department data this week showed initial claims for unemployment benefits have dipped by just 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 428,000.

That is far from the drop below 400,000 claims that would signal an improvement in the labour market.

Ms Romanaux, now back doing freelance consulting for the same museum that laid her off, is grateful for her internship, which ended in May.

She understands the business logic of using older workers as interns and learned about social media without having to pay the cost of education.

‘If I could get someone like me for free, I would be apologetic about it, but I would do it.’

But she says there is nothing easy about starting over at 55 and it was difficult when she made early errors during her internship.

‘It was very stressful,’ she said. ‘Even though they weren't paying me, I felt badly I couldn't do it well.’
