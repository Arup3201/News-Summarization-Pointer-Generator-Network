Stanley and his friend are heard screaming with joy and expressing their disbelief at the win 

But it seems the win was much more than the pair anticipated from the moment the flashing 'congratulations' sign was revealed. 

Expressing his disbelief at hitting the jackpot, Stanley is heard saying: 'No way. No f***ing way.'

He goes on to say 'I think this is happening... this could be real' as the machine slowly builds up to spitting out the takings.

When the coins start spilling out, a woman sitting nearby is seen clapping her hands in excitement.

After 20 minutes, the machine continues to spit out coins and there are fears it will never stop 

Soon it becomes obvious that Stanley and his friend have underestimated how big their win would be, running out of places to store the tokens.

'We've got to stop playing now I think,' the YouTuber is heard saying in the video as he grabs a handful of coins and places them in a cup.

There are so many that the pair decide to give them away to fellow players inside the arcade.

But 20 minutes later the dispenser has not stopped and there are fears it will never stop.

When it finally does Stanley and his friend take their winnings to the counter to trade them in for prizes where two attendants are seen laughing at the amount of coins.
