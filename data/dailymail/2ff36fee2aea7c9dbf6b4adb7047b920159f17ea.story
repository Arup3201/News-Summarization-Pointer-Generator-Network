When Diafra Sakho left the desperate poverty of west Africa to begin his footballing career in France, he had more than enough inspiration to succeed. 

He arrived in Metz as an 18-year-old looking to kick-start his new life, but soon received news that his father Mamadou had died.

His mother was left to take care of four children on precious little income, and Sakho became the sole breadwinner. He says it made him desperate to succeed as a footballer.

'Suddenly I was the senior man in the house. The oldest,' Sakho told the Sunday Mirror. 'It was my responsibility to look after them. It made me even more determined to become a footballer.'

The Senegalese forward joined West Ham from Metz for £4.5 million in the summer - a move that funded the purchase of a new house for the Sakho family in Guediawaye.

Sakho's responsibility since the death of his father, the player admits, was obvious from the moment he found out.

'To lose my father was terrible for me but I knew what I had to do for my mother and my two brothers and sister. It was up to me to provide for them. That was my role, my duty. It gave me perspective in my life.'

'It makes you harder. I am not really afraid of anything when I go on the field. It is not possible to intimidate me, I can look after myself. I have had to learn that on and off the field.' 

And that looks set to continue as Sakho takes to the field against QPR on Sunday. His fifth Premier League appearance will be watched with pride by his family, from their newly-purchased home in Senegal.
