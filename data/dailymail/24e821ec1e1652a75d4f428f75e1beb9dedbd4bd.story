Victim: An autopsy report has revealed 50-year-old Wayne A. Jones (pictured) died last year after being shot 23 times by five police officers in Martinsburg, Virginia

A mentally ill man who stabbed a police officer with a pocket knife was fatally shot 23 times by five cops as he lay on the ground.

An autopsy report shows Wayne A. Jones, 50, died as a result of multiple gunshot 
wounds to his brain, heart, 
lungs, liver, kidney and stomach, following the violent shootout in Martinsburg, Virginia, in March 2013.

Although the schizophrenic man's death was ruled a homicide, Berkeley County grand jury in October did not indict the officers who shot him.

Now the Stephens City man's brothers are suing the city for $200 million in damages on behalf of Jones' estate, claiming the 'rogue' officers used unreasonable and excessive force. 

The family’s lawyer, Sherman L. Lambert Sr., filed a copy of the autopsy report in federal court in Martinsburg on Tuesday. He also filed an amended lawsuit that adds the officers as defendants.

The filing came less than a week after Magistrate James E. Seibert ordered the release of the medical examiner’s findings and a report by West Virginia State Police, which investigated the shooting.

Herald Mail Media reported the five defendants in the wrongful death lawsuit are Erik Herb, Paul Lehman, Eric Neely, Daniel North and William Staub.

According to the amended complaint, the officers shot at Jones as he tried to get to his feet after he stabbed a cop in the torso with a pocket knife. It was later revealed the wound was so minor, the officer didn't need medical treatment.

Lehman was the first officer to encounter Jones and fired his gun eight times. This was followed by Herb's five, Neely's four, Staub's three and North's two.

The officers were armed with Sig Sauer .45-caliber handguns that hold nine rounds in the magazine.

After the shooting occurred, Martinsburg
 police admitted they used projectile stun guns twice on Jones, which 
had little effect, and shot him.

The lawsuit also claimed Jones' body was left in a pool of blood for four hours before he was moved.

According to the lawsuit, the actions of the officers prove that they are 'rogue' and should be disciplined and closely monitored.

The complaint also states that, although the officers were placed on administrative leave following the shooting, they were given various maintenance jobs and trained for other positions at the department.

The police department have not commented publicly on the matter.

Jones’ estate is administered by his brothers, Robert L. Jones and Bruce A. Jones of Winchester, Virginia. A jury trial is set for October 28, 2014.

Jones' brothers had battled the state medical examiner’s office for a copy of the autopsy, which the office initially declined to provide because it involved a homicide.
