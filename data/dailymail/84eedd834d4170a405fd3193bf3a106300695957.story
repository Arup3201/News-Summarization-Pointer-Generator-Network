A university lecturer could be charged with the manslaughter of a schoolgirl who died after taking two ecstasy tablets during a party at his house.

The inquest into Isobel Reilly, 15, was halted yesterday by a coroner who said evidence which had come to light during the hearing could incriminate Brian Dodgeon.

The 61-year-old academic and his partner, Angela Hadjipateras, allowed their 14-year-old daughter to hold a party for 30 friends as the couple socialised overnight 60 miles away.

Possible action: Isobel Reilly, 15, died in April last 
year after taking ecstasy at an unsupervised party in the  
home of Brian Dodgeon, left, and Angela Hadjipateras. The couple now face possible manslaughter charges

During the house party in north 
Kensington, London, four of the schoolchildren swallowed pink ecstasy 
tablets they found in Mr Dodgeon’s bedroom closet.

Isobel collapsed after taking two tablets and could not be revived.

Death: The Kensington home of lecturer Brian Dodgeon where the unsupervised party took place in April last year

Mr Dodgeon pleaded guilty to four 
charges of possessing drugs including ecstasy, LSD and  ketamine. He was
sentenced to eight months in prison suspended for two years last 
December.

Unable to live with the guilt, a week 
after Isobel’s death in April last year he tried to commit suicide by 
jumping off a flyover. He survived despite suffering several broken 
bones and needing brain surgery.

He and Miss Hadjipateras may now face 
charges of manslaughter on the grounds of gross negligence after coroner
Dr Fiona Wilcox ordered a transcript of evidence heard at the inquest 
to be sent to the Crown Prosecution Service.

Dr Wilcox said: ‘It is with an 
extremely heavy heart that I apply my duty to adjourn these proceedings 
because in my view it is likely that a charge of gross negligence 
manslaughter could be brought against Mr Dodgeon and Miss Hadjipateras.

‘The evidence, which I have reflected 
on, heard yesterday [Wednesday], is different to the evidence that the 
CPS initially considered.’ She went on to highlight five issues of 
concern.

‘We heard yesterday that the drugs 
were readily accessible, that Miss Hadjipateras and Mr Dodgeon already 
knew teenagers at parties in their house could behave as teenagers do,’ 
she said.

‘They knew that even when they were 
present, teenagers got drunk, they knew that previously their cannabis 
stash in their home had been found and I have concerns that supervision 
of the party was inadequate at best.’

On the night of the party, the couple 
were staying in Hastings, East Sussex. They had asked family friend 
Camilla Mujica, who lived opposite them, to be on standby in case 
anything happened.

Mourning: Friends and family Issy released balloons in memory of the schoolgirl

Paula Sparks, representing Isobel’s family, said ‘they had very serious concerns about the issues that had been raised’.

Dr Wilcox is also trying to establish 
if Isobel could have been saved if an ambulance had been called earlier 
after she suffered a shaking fit and was foaming at the mouth. Her 
family consider this to be a key issue.

On Wednesday, the opening day of the 
inquest at Westminster Coroner’s Court, it emerged that Isobel, from 
Acton, west London,  had suffered an adverse reaction to the drugs but 
had urged her friends not to call an ambulance because she was afraid of
getting into trouble.

Isobel was pronounced dead in hospital
at 6.30am on April 23, hours after paramedics had arrived. She died of 
MDMA poisoning, the inquest heard.

Mr Dodgeon, who was a research fellow 
at the University of London’s Institute of Education, had been due to 
give evidence yesterday but never got the chance.

A CPS spokesman said: ‘If the coroner sends something to us we will look at it.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
