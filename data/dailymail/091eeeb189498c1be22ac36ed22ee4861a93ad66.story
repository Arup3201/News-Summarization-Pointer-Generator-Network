A schoolgirl in Scotland who roped her schoolmates and teachers into performing in their own version of global hit Uptown Funk  has seen her video go viral across the internet.

In just a few days, the video, entitled Belmont Academy Does Uptown Funk, filmed by Jen Ross, Deputy Head Girl at Belmot Academy, has attracted more than 75,000 views on YouTube.

The footage shows a bored classroom suddenly breaking out into singing and dancing before their infectious rhythm spreads to other parts of the Ayrshire school.

Brushing away that dirt! Staff at the Scottish school break out their best moves while dancing in the corridors

A director in the making? Deputy Head Girl Jen Ross was behind the project...and managed to persuade her teachers to boogie on down

Teachers leave classrooms to join in with the routines with one group of female staff seen 'brushing dirt from their shoulders', which is one of the key moves in the original video for the Bruno Mars/Mark Ronson song.

Jen, who regularly posts her own videos onto YouTube and who has a seat on the Senior Student Council, asked teachers if they'd get involved with her idea.

She told FEMAIL: 'Although some of the teachers were a bit worried about how they would come across, they all got involved and it was great to see everyone having such a good time. 

'I hope the video shows what a great school we have at Belmont and how good the bond is between teachers and pupils. 

She added: 'Lots of other schools have made their own fun versions of pop music videos and I just thought it was Belmont's turn. I chose Uptown Funk as it's a fun song that everyone knows.' 

Although the five-minute video shows plenty of talented moves from the youngsters, some of the teachers might be wondering how their two left feet ended up on camera.

Graeme McLean, Deputy Head Teacher  said: 'Jen knew exactly what she wanted to do with this video and she's done a fantastic job. 

'The whole school was delighted to get behind the project and it really shows the great pupil-teacher relationships we have – as well as some clearly talented dancers!' 

Miss Ross used a friend, Catriona Hill, to help her with choreography. 

Belmont Academy is the sixth largest school in Scotland with more than 1300 pupils attending.
