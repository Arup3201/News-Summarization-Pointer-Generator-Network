Climate change could cause a tourism boom in the Arctic, with cruise ships benefitting from melting ice caps giving them increased access to the area, according to a leaked UN report.

The draft report - which has been dubbed 'alarmist' by one British author involved - claims climate change could help the grey and killer whale populations and increase whale-watching trips to the area.

It will also mean longer summer seasons, with ships being able to pass through key areas which are often frozen for much of the year, according to the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

New routes: Cruise ships could benefit from the melting ice caps in the Arctic region, the controversial UN report has claimed

The Northern Sea Route, above Siberia, and Northwest Passage, above the US and Canada, will be open for a total of 125 days a year by 2050. Currently, the waterways are only clear of ice for around 50 days a year.

The melted ice will mean a more easily navigable shortcut between Asia and Europe, according to the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

And cruise ships will be able to benefit by running more tours to countries including Greenland and Canada.

However, tourists on those ships won't be able to see polar bears in their natural habitat - which are in grave danger of disappearing in certain areas as Earth warms - or witness the traditions of the Inuit people, who stand to lose their hunting customs due to changes in their environment.

Local wildlife: While there will be more cruises, the chances to spot endangered species like polar bears will become more limited

The report, which is currently being drafted by scientists in Japan ahead of being released official, states: 'Loss of sea ice may open up waterways and opportunities for increased cruise traffic and add to an already rapid increase in cruise tourism.'

It adds: 'Climate change has increased the prevalence of cruise tourism throughout Greenland, Norway, Alaska and Canada because of decreasing sea ice.'

The IPCC will publish its first update in seven years on the impacts of climate change and scientists have been meeting this week to agree the wording of the final document, which will be used to inform policy decisions of governments around the world.

Opportunity: There will be more cruise opportunities for tourists and chance to spot whales, says the report

However, Professor Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex, said fellow UN academics were exaggerating climate change and comparing it to the ‘apocalypse’. He has since refused to put his name to the report.

Arctic cruises have increased in popularity in recent years, with more and more ships plying the northern waterways and reaching areas that can't yet be discovered by plane and car.
