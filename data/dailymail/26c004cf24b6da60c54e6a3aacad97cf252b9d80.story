A man has been arrested over the attempted murder of a policeman after the officer was run over as he tried to make an arrest.

The driver of a Volkswagen Golf ploughed into the officer, dragging him along the ground, before speeding off, as he sought to apprehend him as part of an on-going inquiry.

The unnamed policeman suffered a cracked vertebrae and severe grazing from the incident outside the Wealden Hall pub in Larksfield, Kent, early Saturday evening. He was rushed to hospital where his condition is serious but stable.

Kent Police launched a huge man hunt, scrambling helicopters and all available officers, to catch the driver.

He initially evaded captured but yesterday a 27-year-old man from Rochester, Kent, handed himself in at Maidstone Police station.

Witnesses have described how the officer lay in the road as members of the public rushed to help.

Builder Evo Ivanov told the Daily Mail: ‘The road was all closed off and there was a man lying in the road.

‘People were giving him first aid.

‘There were lots of plain clothed policemen around.’

Police refused to let patrons who had been eating and drinking at the Wealden Hall pub leave the pub car park, according to one witness.

She said: ‘My son was in the pub at the time and the police weren’t letting anyone leave the car park.’

One pub worker, who asked not to be named, claimed police had been following the suspect ‘all day’ as part of a wider investigation.

He said: ‘Police had been following him the driver all day. He pulled into the pub carpark to try to shake them off and when they tried to arrest him he drove off and hit one of them [police officers].

Kent Police have declined to discuss the operation but appealed for witnesses of the hit-and-run to come forward.

A Kent Police spokesman said: ‘A 27 year old man from Rochester has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following an incident between a gold Volkswagen Golf and a police officer who was carrying out an enquiry with the driver of the vehicle at the time.

‘The male officer, who was out of his car at the time, was taken to a London hospital where he is in a serious but stable condition.

‘Kent Police would like to thank members of the public for all their help, best wishes and responses so far.’
