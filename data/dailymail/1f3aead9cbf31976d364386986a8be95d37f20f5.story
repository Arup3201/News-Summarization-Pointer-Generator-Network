These stunning images captured by a British photographer are making some of the world’s greatest landscapes look like fascinating works of abstract art.

Acclaimed travel and nature photographer Peter Adams travelled thousands of miles to document the varied surfaces of the planet – all from high above.

The 55-year-old, from the Cotswolds, snapped the photos while flying in light aircraft, helicopters and gyrocopters over some of the most famous tourist destinations in the world, including Yellowstone National Park in the US and Namibia’s Namib Desert.

From high above, Yellowstone’s Grand Prismatic Spring looks like an alien volcano, while the desert in Andalucia, Spain looks like a scene from Mars.

Some of his most striking images were captured in Australia, where he flew over the blue waters at the Great Barrier Reef and a beach in Queensland, where the sand meets the sea to create a spectacular swirling pattern.

Another photo from Queensland shows the destructive force of lightning, as a green forest is marred by a patch of grey, dead trees. In other scenes, tourists look like ants as they snap photos of a magnificent waterfall in Iceland, and strips of land nestled between canals in northern Holland look like brushstrokes.

Peter’s work has been featured in publications around the world and he has been recognised with numerous awards and honours, including 2003 Travel Photographer of the Year.
