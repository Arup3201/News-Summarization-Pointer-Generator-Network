An audio recording allegedly detailing the final hours accused killer Gable Tostee spent with Warriena Wright before she plunged off his balcony to her death has been leaked online.

The 199-minute file was uploaded onto a Canadian website before it is due to be tendered in court in Tostee's murder trial, the Brisbane Times reported.

This comes after a post on a bodybuilder forum written by a person claiming to be Tostee has been taken down.

Under the user name of 'GT', a person on a bodybuilding forum has defended accused murderer Gable Tostee

In the post, user 'GT' defended the 28-year-old over the death of Ms Wright. 

Tostee was charged with the murder of New Zealand bank clerk Warriena Wright who fell 14 storeys from his Gold Coast apartment balcony in August after meeting him on online dating app Tinder.

In the forum post GT denied that he tried to delete an audio recording made on the night Ms Wright died, adding that he often recorded his 'drunk' nights.

'That night, the police seized my phone and my parents' phones, where they found the recording,' he wrote.

'While I did not expect them to seize it, it is completely untrue that I tried to delete it, as it proved what happened.

'I regularly made audio recordings of my drunk nights on the town in case something happened. I kept them for myself but didn't need to listen to them 99% of the time. It's so easy to do using a smartphone and comes at such a small cost, and sometimes the recordings have been invaluable.'

GT also addressed 'fabricated stories about me having cameras to film "homemade porn", explaining he had two cameras in his apartment for security purposes only.

'[The cameras] came in handy for example when I was able to retrieve my wallet from a girl who stole it,' he said.

Tostee was remanded in custody but was released last month on strict bail conditions which require him to live with his parents in Carrara, keep off Tinder, stay off Facebook, not drink alcohol and adhere to a nightly curfew.

In the lengthy post online GT also defended Tostee, saying there have been many 'misconceptions and untruths' that have been circulating in the media and the public about his involvement.

They also posted several pictures claiming to be from inside Tostee's apartment. 

One of the photographs show a tanning machine he owns on the Avalon Apartments balcony on Orchid Avenue, which has spectacular views over Surfers Paradise.

GT added he had been left distraught after Ms Wright's death and believed his silence on the topic had done more harm than good.

'Knowing I was the last person to be with her, it has left me permanently scarred and not a day passes that I don't wish I could go back in time and prevent it,' GT wrote.

'For at least a week after it happened I was so overwhelmed I was unable to laugh or even crack a smile. 

'I broke down in tears several times a day, or whenever I saw her picture in the news. 

'Even though I had only known her for a night I was horrified that this had happened to her. I would never wish for it to happen to anybody.'

GT said he sympathised with Ms Wright's family and it pained him to think of them.

'While I have not had the chance to meet or speak to Warriena's family, it pains me to think of the loss and suffering they must be experiencing,' he wrote.

Along with the posts, GT posted photos of what is believed to be Tostee's balcony overlooking Surfers Paradise

Tostee's case is set to be mentioned in January after he was released on strict bail conditions in November

GT also slammed news outlets for the coverage of the case, describing it as 'disgraceful'.

'They have no respect for the dignity of the people involved,' he said.

'A young woman had died and they needed a villain. My silence only fuelled peoples' imagination, and the media did everything they could to exploit that, including lying and misleading. 

'They did everything they could to establish me as an evil monster, a portrayal which could not be further from the truth.' 

Tostee has always maintained his innocence in Ms Wright's death and was released from custody last month

Queensland police have confirmed they know of the post's existence and were looking to confirm if it was Tostee

Queensland police have told news.com.au they knew of the post's existence and were looking to confirm if it was in fact Tostee.

But Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said: 'It does not appear to be a breach of any bail condition.'  

If GT is in fact Tostee, this would not be the first time he has reached out on social media.

During his time in custody, the 28-year-old posted a message to family and friends on Facebook - including an address for them to post letters to him.

'To all my friends and those who have been supporting me, I want to thank you and say that I miss you all,' he wrote from jail.

'I have been in custody for almost a month now for a crime I did not commit and have lost contact with almost everyone.

'I maintain my absolute innocence and hope that this nightmare will be over soon.' 

Queensland police say this post would not breach his bail conditions imposed by the court

If GT is in fact Tostee, it is not the first time he has used social media to maintain his innocence

Tostee's case will be mentioned in January. 

Until he faces trial, which is expected to be next year, Tostee cannot drive, is banned from carousing on the Surfers Paradise nightclub strip and it not allowed after dark.

After he walked free from jail, Daily Mail Australia obtained a letter that was part of his desperate bid to be released

In the handwritten note scrawled on a lined A4 piece of paper, Gable Tostee apologised for drink driving and admits to 'drowning myself with alcohol'.

The letter was penned at Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in a scrappy style with occasional spelling errors and includes an admission by Tostee that 'I have a problem with binge drinking' and that he has put people's lives at risk.

Tostee specifically apologises for drinking in the early hours of July 27 when he was caught drink driving by police, saying it was the 'wake-up call I needed'.
