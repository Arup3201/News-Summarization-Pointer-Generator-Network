The parents of a two-year-old girl with a rare blood disorder have urged the Government to pay for a ‘miracle drug’ to keep her alive.

Indie Smith is one of just 140 people in the UK who suffer from the disease – for which only one effective and safe treatment has been found, the drug Soliris.

But it costs up to £250,000 a year per patient. Indie was among a handful of patients prescribed Soliris on a trial basis. But the trial is due to end and the drug is not available on the NHS.

Clare Smith and husband Gavin are fighting to secure funding for a new treatment, Soliris, for their daughter Indie, aged two, who has a rare kidney cancer

A quarter of all people with Indie’s condition – atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (aHUS) – die shortly after diagnosis.

Indie’s parents, Clare, 36, and heating engineer Gavin, 40, of Chelmsford, Essex, were amazed by her rapid improvement on Soliris.

‘Within two days of the first dose she started to become normal again,’ Clare said. ‘Before that, she wasn’t with us at all. Soliris is expensive but it is a miracle drug because what it’s done for Indie is amazing.’

Indie responded to treatment with Soliris (eculizumab) within two days of receiving the first dose during a clinical trial

Clare and Gavin, who also have three sons, now fear for her future when the Soliris trial – funded by the drug’s American manufacturers – comes to an end in October.

Last year the Advisory Group for National Specialised Services (AGNSS), a committee of experts which advises Ministers, recommended the drug be approved for use in the UK.

But the Government instead referred the matter to the National Institute for Health and Clinic Excellence (NICE), which has no procedures to evaluate it.

Tim Goodship, Professor of Renal Medicine at Newcastle University, said: ‘I think Ministers’ primary concern is its affordability.’

A body called NHS Specialised Services commissions drugs for rare conditions.

The aim is to protect the budgets of hospitals whose finances would come under severe strain if they were required to fund expensive treatments for small numbers of patients out of their own resources.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We need to make sure NHS resources are used wisely.’
