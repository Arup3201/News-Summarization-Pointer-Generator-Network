Rejects material matters: Uri Geller not spend a penny of his wealth as he never carries cash or credit cards

His ability to bend spoons has seen him create a multi-million pound fortune.

But Uri Geller does not spend a penny of his wealth as he never carries cash or credit cards and does not know if he has a bank account or a pension.

The 68-year-old said he made a decision to shun all material matters and focus on his spirituality after fame and fortune drove him to illness many years ago.

Geller said: ‘I do not own a wallet. I do not carry any money or cards. My wife pays for my purchases in shops and my brother-inlaw deals with everything else. I don’t buy anything myself, on principle.

‘In the early 1970s, I was totally obsessed with fame and fortune and I couldn’t handle my success. I became bulimic. Then John Lennon directed me to Japan to find spirituality, and that changed my life. I detached myself totally from material stuff.

‘From that time, I’ve found systems and methods to make sure I don’t handle or deal with money myself. I don’t even know if I have a bank account — I’d have to ask my brother-in-law.

‘Probably my brother-in-law and my wife keep a Visa or an American Express. I don’t really know. I don’t interfere in the monetary system they operate. I leave it absolutely to them.’

Geller became famous in 1969 when he began performing in his native Israel. He bent cutlery, described hidden drawings and made watches stop with what he described as the power of his mind.

In the 1970s, he travelled to America, where his paranormal abilities were tested by academics. The Secret Life of Uri Geller: CIA Masterspy?, a book by Jonathan Margolis, tells of his life, from being an Israeli paratrooper to working with the CIA.

Geller has also written other novels and worked as a model. He lives in Sonning, Berkshire, with his wife Hanna, 64. Their son, Daniel, 33, is a lawyer in London and their daughter Natalie, 32, is a Hollywood actress.

His new neighbours are movie star George Clooney, 53 and his wife Amal, 36 and Geller has a warning for them about a local ghost. speaking to the Sunday Times Fame & Forune section, he revealed: ‘I can see the actor’s house from my second-floor window. 

'I’ve not seen him in the village yet, but I’ve mailed him three books: The Secret Life of Uri Geller, The Geller Effect and my novel Ella, which I’m hoping will be made into a movie.

'You can see his house from Sonning bridge and I have seen strange things happening on that bridge. 

'There is a ghost of a little girl who crosses it. I have no doubt in my mind that George Clooney will see her. It is the best house in the neighbourhood to be able to see this ghost.'
