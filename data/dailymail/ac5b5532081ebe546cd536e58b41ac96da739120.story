These images show the new state-of-the-art children's hospital at Alder Hey in Liverpool - that will be  built in a park to offer all patients views of parkland from their window.

The new £237m hospital, which has been designed with the help of children and young 
people, will have 270 beds, including 48 for those requiring critical care.

The hospital, which will stand next 
door to the current Victorian site, is the first new private 
finance initiative (PFI) hospital since the coalition government came into power 
three years ago.

It will sit in the heart of Springfield Park, creating 
views of green space or parkland from every patient’s window.

The new Alder Hey in the Park hospital will have 270 beds, including 48 critical care beds. The majority of children and their families will have their own room with en-suite facilities

Once the 
new hospital is built, the old one will be demolished and the site 
landscaped.

Scheduled to open in 2015, there will also be 16 operating 
theatres, four for day-case surgery and 12 for inpatients. 

Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust provides care for over 275,000
children and young people every year.

Each year, approximately 60,000 
children visit its A&E department (the busiest of its kind in the 
country) while over 30,000 attend as outpatients.

The majority of children and their families 
will have their own room with en-suite facilities and each ward will 
have its own kitchen providing freshly cooked food to order.

It will be built by a consortium comprising the construction firms John Laing, Laing O’Rourke and Interserve.

As with most PFI deals, the trust will pay off the debt over a 30-year 
period and it will be structured so as to stay off the government’s 
balance sheet, the Financial Times reported.

The paper also reported that the sign-off by the government suggests it will proceed will further PFI schemes, despite the controversy surrounding them.

Just last week, MailOnline reported how the new £545 million hospital in Birmingham built under the controversial PFI scheme has 
run out of beds, forcing bosses to re-open wards on the hospital it 
replaced.

Unprecedented demand on A&E admissions at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham means two wards will be brought back into action at the neighbouring old Queen Elizabeth Hospital, which was built in the 1930s and closed in 2010.

Once the new hospital is built, the old Victorian building will be demolished and the site landscaped

PFI schemes were a key part of the Labour government's modernisation programme for hospitals.

Under the schemes, private firms paid for the building of new hospitals, with  trusts repaying them over 30 or more years, with interest.

But due to the nature of the deals, the ultimate total cost is often far more than the value of the assets.

But the Treasury told the Financial Times that it had 'not planned to withdraw PFI schemes 
already in the pipeline'.
