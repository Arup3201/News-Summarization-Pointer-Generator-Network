George Osborne today refused to change course on his austerity plan despite the pound slumping to a new low today as investors reacted to the loss of Britain's gold-plated AAA credit rating.

The Chancellor was called to the Commons this afternoon to be grilled by MPs after the UK's currency fell to its lowest level against the dollar for nearly three years and hit a 16-month low against the euro.

The
pound fell sharply to $1.51 and was as low as 1.14 euros today, 
compared with 1.23 euros earlier this year and close to 1.29 euros in 
last July. It means that £500 in a UK tourist’s pocket is now worth just 570 euros – compared with €645 last year.

Under fire: Chancellor George Osborne faces criticism from all sides after Britain lost its gold-plated AAA credit rating

By contrast, the FTSE 100 rose by more than 30 points, suggested that the downgrade did not come as a surprise to investors who had grown used to bad news from Britain after a run of disappointing economic announcements.

Mr Osborne insisted: 'We will go on delivering on the economic plan that has brought the deficit down by a quarter.'

He told MPs there had not been 'excessive volatility' as the markets gave their reaction to the Moody's decision.

Sterling has been locked into a downward spiral over the past week amidst fears the Bank of England could re-start its quantitative easing programme, fuelling inflation.

Mr Osborne told MPs the decision by Moody's was a 'stark reminder of the debt problems built up in Britain over the last decade and a warning to anyone who thinks we can run away from dealing with those problems'.

However, Labour's Ed Balls noted that Mr Osborne Mr Osborne had made maintaining the AAA rating a key benchmark for his stewardship of the economy,.

'The first economic test he set himself, now failed by this downgraded Chancellor,' Mr Balls said.

The FTSE, which is strongly 
influenced by the performance of international firms, held on to its 
recent gains, climbing 34 points to 6370 by 2.45 this afternoon.

Sterling's continuing losses could 
mean misery for holidaymakers, who have already seen the value of the 
pound fall by seven per cent this year, and put an extra squeeze on 
consumers by pushing up the cost of everything from petrol to pasta.

In a fresh blow to the Chancellor, his Tory Cabinet colleague and former chancellor Kenneth Clarke admitted yesterday it will take ‘years’ to re-establish ‘sensible economic growth’ in Britain.

And Business Secretary Vince Cable warned Mr Osborne that producing another ‘slash and burn’ austerity budget would be ‘utterly foolish’ and demanded more action on growth.

In
signs of a growing Coalition row over the economy, Deputy Prime 
Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘We’re not just balancing the books – we need 
to do a whole lot more than that.’

Despite the downgrade, David Cameron's official spokesman insisted today that the Government's economic plan was 'working' and the Prime Minister remained committed to seeing it through.

'The plan is working and that is why we believe the economy is healing,' the spokesman told a daily Westminster press briefing.

Treasury
sources say the Chancellor’s budget, due in three weeks, will be an 
‘unabashed budget for business’ and is expected to include corporation 
tax cuts.

But he faces the immediate prospect of a run on the pound after the downgrade by credit ratings agency Moody’s.

Mr Clarke admitted the pound is no longer seen as a ‘safe haven’.

He
told Sky News: ‘It’s going to take several more years of this in order 
to get back not just our credit rating but to get back to sensible 
economic growth.’ 

While 
the problems set the stage for a crunch budget in three weeks time, Mr 
Cable warned against £10billion of fresh cuts the Tories want to use to 
balance the books.

He said: ‘To embark on a slash and 
burn policy in response to this would be utterly foolish and 
counterproductive. The real thing we have to focus on is the real 
economy and getting growth back.’

Citing as examples the US and France,
both downgraded last year, he also argued the loss of the AAA rating 
was ‘largely symbolic’, adding: ‘In terms of the real economy there is 
no reason why the downgrade should have any impact.’

Mr Osborne is also under fire from Tory MPs such as Adam Afriyie, who said they must cut taxes or lose the next election.

The
Windsor MP and self-made millionaire called on the Government to phase 
out employers’ National Insurance contributions and halve the 
corporation tax on profits to 12.5 per cent.

Others warned Mr Osborne is in the ‘last chance saloon’. One senior backbencher said: ‘Genius George must go.’ Another said: ‘He faces a fundamental issue of credibility.’

Foolhardy: The Chancellor chose to wear the rating as a badge of honour and must now live with the consequences after the downgrade

George Osborne has, in many ways, only himself to blame for the political backlash as a result of Britain losing its prized AAA credit rating.

The Chancellor chose to wear the rating as a badge of honour, constantly referring to it as the rewards of Britain’s budgetary discipline.

By doing so, he has been hoist by his own petard.

In itself, the downgrade is of little consequence. Both the United States in 2011 and France last year lost their top-notch standing without any noticeable impact on their ability to borrow on global markets at very low rates.

Britain will always be regarded as a good credit risk.

This is because the average age of the nation’s bonds or gilt edged stock that issued is for 15 years – a far longer maturity than other leading nations.

As a result the country is not constantly having to ask the market to buy newly issued bonds or gilts to replace old ones.

Also, what sets the UK apart from Greece (and even Germany) is that we have never, in our entire history, failed to pay back our debt.

The biggest risk for Osborne is that the loss of our credit standing leads to a lengthy and destabilising run on the pound.

The currency has already fallen a sharp 7 per cent in value against the dollar and the euro since the start of the year.

So far, this reduction has been viewed with quiet satisfaction by the Bank of England governor.

Even though it means higher prices for imported food and energy, policy makers believe the best hope for restoring growth is a cheaper pound, making British goods and services more competitive in the global marketplace.

But there is a very big difference between a gentle slide in the currency of the kind that has already taken place, and the panic-selling that occurs when the markets lose confidence in a nation’s ability to stabilise its affairs.

Realistically, there is no reason for a run on the pound. However slow the UK’s economic growth and however big our debt mountain, the UK’s problems are as nothing compared to those of the wounded euroland.

And if markets were rational they would take no notice at all of what the credit rating agencies have to say. After all, it was these very same organisations that stamped the toxic American sub-prime mortgage debt as AAA before the financial crisis. 

Nevertheless, it would be  irresponsible for the Chancellor if the weekend’s events were not to lead to some rethinking of economic strategy ahead of the budget.

Osborne needs to do two things simultaneously. He needs to slash a welfare budget that is still increasing at an unacceptable pace and move rapidly to improve growth by getting the banks lending again to households and small businesses. 

Most importantly he needs to radically reform a tax system so onerous that companies move mountains to avoid paying tax and are refusing to invest in their businesses. 

The truth is that more imaginative policies are required by the Chancellor to rekindle growth in output and put the setback of a lost credit rating behind him.

So far, truly bold initiatives have been sadly lacking when it has come to boosting output.
