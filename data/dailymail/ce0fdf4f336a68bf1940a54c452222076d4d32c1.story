Nine high school students have been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting two underage girls multiple times. 

Staff at Venice High School in Los Angeles informed police of a suspected attack on a female student on Tuesday.

However the LAPD found the sexual misconduct involved another student and had occurred frequently for more than a year.

An investigation has since identified 14 suspects between the ages of 14 and 17 who have allegedly been involved in sexual activity at the school - some consensual and some not.

Investigation: Nine students at Venice High School in Los Angeles have been arrested in connection with sexual assaults on two underage girls dating back to 2013 

Eight youngsters from the school were arrested on Friday while another was arrested at another location.

The suspected attacks are believed to have occurred on and off campus and date back to around December 2013. 

However the majority  are believed to have taken place in the last two months.

A statement by the LAPD read: 'In an effort to protect the victims, all subjects were arrested at Venice High School and transported to Pacific Area Station for booking. 

'The investigation is still ongoing and detectives will continue to interview all parties involved as well as collect any additional evidence.' 

A source for the LA Times said the accusations involves the male students working together to pressure girls into having sex.

Los Angeles Schools Police Chief Steve Zimmerman told the media: 'When we have information about issues that concerning student safety and issues pertained to the school as a whole, we will do everything to ensure that behavior doesn't happen.'

The police department confirmed rape wasn't involved but said it involved forced sexual assault. 

Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Ramon Cortines told The Times the students' parents had been notified and counselors were on campus to assist any other students.

He said: 'This is a painful moment for Venice High School, and this district. I want you to know that no sexual misconduct of any kind by students or staff will ever be tolerated in L.A. Unified.'
