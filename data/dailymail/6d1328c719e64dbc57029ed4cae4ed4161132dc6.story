Leighton Baines is well known for his love of music but it appears his appreciation does not extend to all genres - specifically the latest pop songs dominating the charts.

The Everton defender, who is friends with rocker Miles Kane and Arctic Monkeys' front-man Alex Turner, regularly attends gigs and also plays the guitar.

But in an interview with Match of the Day magazine, the England international has given his thoughts on six mainstream tracks which don't feature on his own iPod.

As well as admitting that he doesn't know any of One Direction's hit songs, Baines also reveals that Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk is regularly played in the Toffees' dressing room.

Scroll down to read Baines' full verdict on the music world, including his views on Ed Sheeran, Meghan Trainor and Avicii. 

Meghan Trainor – All About The Bass

'This is the kind of track we play in the dressing room, but it's not my cup of tea really! The lads keep me away from the stereo because they don't enjoy any of the stuff I put on.'

Mark Ronson (featuring Bruno Mars) – Uptown Funk

'The lads are all playing this one! It's quite a cool tune for a pop song. It's good, Mark Ronson's always trying to do interesting stuff.'

The interview with Leighton Baines features in the latest edition of Match of the Day magazine, on sale between April 21 and 27.

Avicii – The Nights

'This sounds like something my 11-year-old lad might listen to! He's getting to the point where he knows his own mind so I'm not going to force my favourite music on him.'

Ed Sheeran – Thinking Out Loud

'Ed Sheeran's massive, he's not someone I've got into yet, but he's obviously doing well enough for himself. I think a lot of kids like him.'

George Ezra – Budapest

'This is a good song. I haven't heard much of George Ezra's stuff, this is all stuff my kids play around the house so I recognise it.'

One Direction – Night Changes

'I have to admit, I don't really know any of their songs! But it all makes sense, this is the sort of thing the kids are into, I just don't listen to any of it.'

Ed Sheeran is 'massive' according to Baines, but the Everton man is yet to start listening to his music
