Three of Britain's biggest aquariums have come under fire for serving fish and chips in their restaurants - despite promoting conservation of marine life.

The National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth, The Deep in Hull and Blue Planet Aquarium, Cheshire, all received letters from animal rights charity, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). 

The letters condemn the popular attractions for serving seafood, comparing it to 'serving monkey nuggets at a zoo'.

But the aquariums have hit back at PETA, claiming the food they serve is all responsibly sourced.  

The letter, written by PETA's specialist project manager Dawn Carr, urges the aquariums to switch to fish-free options.

Writing to the National Marine Aquarium, she said: 'The National Marine Aquarium advertises itself as a place where people can cultivate an understanding of and admiration for sea animals.

'Yet after inviting people to look on these glorious, fascinating animals in awe, it's odd that your cafe then invites people to stick a fork in them. 

'Serving fish in an aquarium is like serving monkey nuggets at a zoo.'

Peta is calling for the aquarium to take fish off the menu - and suggests the attraction instead serves vegetarian options such as fish-free fish fingers, faux-fish cakes and vegetarian prawns.

'The fact remains that the seafood in your cafes is made from living sea animals who treasured life and were needlessly subjected to pain and fear,' it added.

On the menu: The restaurant at The Deep in Hull, East Yorkshire, offers a number of seafood dishes including the 'catch of the day', 'chorizo and smoked cod croquettes' and 'crayfish, tomato, chilli and fetel cocktail'

But the aquarium hit back claiming it is pro-sustainable fishing.

Dr Gibson, managing director of the National Marine Aquarium, said serving fish doesn't compromise its position as a marine conservation charity.

He said: 'We work to educate consumers and our visitors on the importance of eating fish and seafood that has been sourced in a sustainable way, to help nurture a sympathetic understanding of our oceans.

'All fish and seafood served in the aquarium cafe is ethically sourced and MSC compliant.

'We have a robust purchasing policy in place that is proactive in sustainable and seasonal fish, ensuring we maintain the highest levels of sustainable fish sourcing practices possible.'

The animal rights charity also wrote to The Deep in Hull, East Yorkshire, who responded by saying it will not be changing its policy. 

Colin Brown, chief executive of The Deep, said: 'We will be replying to Peta respectfully.

'We don't believe eating fish is wrong but the fish must be from a sustainable source and we are very careful about that.

'Morally, how can you differentiate between selling fish or selling a burger or sausage? To be honest, it is a matter of opinion.' 

Bosses at Blue Planet Aquarium, in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, also received a letter from PETA. 

Mimi Bekhechi group director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, wrote: 'Blue Planet Aquarium advertises itself as a place where people can cultivate an understanding of and admiration for sea animals.

'Yet after inviting people to look on these glorious, fascinating animals in awe, it's odd that your restaurant then invites people to stick a fork in them.'

She also drew attention to recent Cambridge University research suggesting fish have emotions, feel pain and live in complex social structures.

'Biologists have found that fish develop relationships with each other and grieve when their companions die,' she said.

'Some fish are capable of using tools, while others gather information by eavesdropping.

'These intelligent, sensitive animals are so good-natured that Dr Sylvia Earle, the world's leading marine biologist, has said 'I wouldn't deliberately eat a grouper any more than I'd eat a cocker spaniel'.' 

Blue Planet has hit back, saying that providing fish to eat is perfectly ethical, as long as they are sustainably sourced. 

A spokesman said: 'All our fish products are sustainably sourced and caught under the Marine Stewardship Council Licence.

'We have never advocated people not to eat fish. However, we do believe supplying only sustainably sourced fish products in our restaurants and cafés is an ethical approach.'
