A man rolling a joint next to a police motorcycle and a woman taking a selfie behind the wheel are among those being shamed by authorities on social media.

Police in Western Australia posted photographs of the two offenders caught in the act to Twitter with tongue-in-cheek warnings about safe driving in the holiday period.

In the first picture a man can be seen in the driver's seat of a car rolling the joint in his lap, in full view of the police officer who has pulled up next to his vehicle.

'Top tip - Your selfie looks fab when @WAPoliceTraffic bike is filming you,' the police tweeted.

In WA, the infringement if you are caught taking a selfie while driving is a $400 fine and six demerit points over the Christmas period.

The photos were taken by officers wearing helmet cameras in the week leading up to Christmas, WA Today reported.

WA Police have issued 324 driver distraction infringements and 19 cautions.

The majority of notices issued were given out by unmarked motorcycles.

This is not the first time police have taken to social media to shame negligent drivers.

Highway Patrol in NSW regularly post photographs on their Facebook page of law-breakers taken by officers from NSW and around the world.

Pictured are drivers with over-sized packages hanging from open boots, carpets rolling from the back of vans and mattresses loosely strapped to car roofs. There's even a motorcyclist wearing a chair over his helmet.

Crazy photographs include trucks taking roundabouts and blocking lanes, ladders in the back of flat-bed utes that aren't tied down and back-seat passengers doubling up as safety restraints, holding on to beds attached to a car roof.

The page has gone viral with more than 120,000 'fans' either send images or simply viewing the latest compilation of reckless acts.

Police have said while some of the examples are viewed as 'light-hearted fun', they can also lead to serious injury and sometimes death.

Inspector Mick Timms, of NSW Police, said a motorist was killed last year when a load fell from the back of a truck at Liverpool, south west of Sydney, and crushed the driver travelling behind.

He said the images are evidence that these acts are not just happening in foreign countries with lax road laws, but back home in Australia as well.

'We get sent pictures from time to time and it just shows that these acts are not just happening in other countries but here as well,' Inspector Timms said.

Strange bedfellows: Not one, but two mattresses stacked on one another while they stick out the back of this car's boot

Mr Timms said where there is enough evidence to investigate a tip-off, police will usually take steps to prosecute drivers.

But in most cases - such as the booted-up barbecue - identifying drivers can sometimes be difficult.

'The barbecue driver had no number plates, and there was no date, time or place on the image.'

'It makes it hard to track down.'

He said most of the images that filter through are of trucks and large heavy vehicles with illegally stacked or restrained loads.

They're potentially deadly death traps for cars, pedestrians and passing motorcycles travelling behind or past the culprits.
