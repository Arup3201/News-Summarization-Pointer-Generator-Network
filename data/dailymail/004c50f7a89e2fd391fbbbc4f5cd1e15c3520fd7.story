Osama bin Laden was planning a terrorist outrage to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11 with Barack Obama number one on his hit list.

The former leader of Al Qaeda wanted to shoot down the U.S. President’s jet Air Force One during a trip abroad.

He also wanted to murder General David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, and was still obsessed with using planes to carry out terror attacks.

Attack: Osama Bin Laden was planning to bring down Air Force One with President Barack Obama on board

Target: Bin Laden was hoping to take out the presidential jet while it transported Barack Obama on a foreign visit

Plot: Osama bin Laden had been planning to attack the U.S. on the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Every year since the initial attack two blue lights have shone in the place of the towers in memory of the victims

But was he in control? Other intelligence gleaned from the Pakistan lair suggested Bin Laden was losing his grip over Al Qaeda

The terror chief had
 already begun putting a team of militants together for the attack, 
according to communications seized by Navy Seals from his Pakistani 
lair.

Ideally one of his followers would fly a jet into a major sporting event in America, leading to massive loss of life.

The disclosures came from the ‘treasure trove’ of intelligence seized at the mansion hideout in Pakistan where bin Laden was killed during a raid by U.S. special forces earlier this year.

Officials say that the attack he was planning was in the preliminary stage and that bin Laden had been discussing who would carry it out with his operations chief Attiyah Abd al-Rahman.

The plan was to shoot down Air Force one or Marine One, the President’s helicopter, whilst it was in mid-flight by firing a missile or rocket propelled grenade from another aircraft.

General Petraeus would also be killed in a similar fashion, the documents show.

Former FBI agent Brad Garrett said that despite improvements in security the plan to hijack a small jet and fly it into a sports stadium could work.

‘We have so many small airports, you could fly below radar,’ he said. ‘That's possibly doable.'

Although at the embryonic stage, the details of the plot lead CIA acting director Michael Morell to tell staff that one of their top priorities was to ensure such an attack never took place.

The haul of computers and handwritten journals recovered from the compound in Abottabad have taught CIA operatives more in the past weeks than they knew in the previous 10 years.

But he had been 
having disagreements with his operations chief Attiyah Abd al-Rahman, on
 who should be included in the attack team, the Wall Street Journal 
reported.

Interestingly Bin Laden may have been losing his grip on control of the terror group. According to other materials in the treasure trove of documents found at his Abottabad lair during the May 2 raid, he was often ignored by his henchmen.

'What we found was that he was very isolated, and it is clearly the case
 he was struggling to continue to hold on to the type of influence and 
to direct operations in ways he may have been able to do in the past,' a
 U.S. official said.

Plans for an attack on the 9/11 
anniversary were only in the discussion phase, according to U.S. 
officials who added they hadn't seen any signs the plot was ready to be 
carried out.

The plot was one of a smattering of threats to come out of the materials seized during the raid in which Bin Laden was killed.

In
 those first days afterwards, intelligence officials confirmed there had
 been strong evidence Bin Laden was all for carrying out attacks on 
significant American dates - July 4 and September 11 for example.

But this is the first time they have spoken of an actual attempt planned for this year's anniversary.

Counter-terrorism staff from 
half-a-dozen U.S. agencies have now raked over the entire bounty 
collected from the raid, but have had little success extracting any 
concrete leads from the documents.

Information including phone numbers that could have led to other terrorist leaders were rendered useless almost as soon as they fell into the Government's hands, officials revealed.

'The treasure trove has not led to any big takedowns, because the bad 
guys knew we had it and adapted,' a senior U.S. official told the Journal.

The two phone numbers that Bin Laden had sewn into his clothing at the time of his death led nowhere, they added.

Little yield: Other material gathered during the raid at the hideout in Abottabad has not led to many concrete leads

Situation room: Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton receive an update on the mission against bin Laden before he is killed by U.S Navy Seals

One connected to a public phone centre in the tribal areas of Pakistan; the other was a dead end.

Other numbers scattered about the compound also led nowhere.

Meanwhile relations between the U.S. and Pakistan continue to go down hill. The Pakistani government are livid about the raid, claiming not to have known anything about it before it was carried out.

Historic: President Obama announces the death of bin Laden from the East Room of the White House on May 2. The Obama administration has said it has 'no regrets' about the raid despite relations with Pakistan at an all-time low

Celebration: Thousands took to the streets in New York City to celebrate the death of Bin Laden

Ill feeling: The May 2 raid has caused a lot of anti-American feeling in Pakistan and has left relations between the two nations frosty

The Obama administration, worried about leaks within the Pakistani government, didn't want  to tell Islamabad before the raid, it has been reported.

Some U.S. officials believe certain fractions of the Pakistani government knew about Bin Laden's whereabouts.

The CIA has met repeatedly with Pakistan's intelligence agency to try and smooth things over. The most recent meeting came today when Pakistan intelligence chief, Lt Gen Ahmad Shuja Pasha met with CIA acting Director Michael Morell to discus how the two nations could move forward in the fight against terrorism.

The Obama administration announce last Sunday it was suspending $800million in aid to Pakistan, as a punishment for what it sees as not aiding the ongoing counter-terrorism threat.
