One shameful statistic, if that is the right word, lies behind the dawn queues outside the Sunbury Health Centre in Surrey. 

It is this: the surgery was originally designed for 6,000 patients, but now serves nearly 19,000.

Had the building in which the practice is based been a block of flats, say – and not part of the beleaguered NHS – it would surely have been closed down by now on the grounds of overcrowding.

And still they wait... 24 hours on, the dawn queue at the Sunbury Health Centre is back

Instead, the sick and the elderly find the phones at Sunbury continuously engaged (a fifth of those using the centre had to wait more than ten minutes for someone to answer their call, according to a patient survey) and, even if they do get through, it is impossible to book a same-day appointment, and face up two weeks to see a doctor.

Hence the reason why nursery teaching assistant Talitha Taylor, 34, foster carer Georgina White, 58, and retired Ray Samphire, 68, were among those who, once again, were waiting in the cold and dark outside the centre from 6.18am yesterday; a scene repeated at GP surgeries up and down the country. ‘Crazy’, Mr Samphire called it.

Nevertheless, the surgery passed a recent Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection with ‘flying colours’, which perhaps tells us more about the CQC than the Sunbury Health Centre.

So what has gone wrong, or rather who is to blame for the scandal?

Not the doctors who run the centre, it seems, if a newsletter issued by the centre is taken at face value. 

The extra demand is a result of new housing developments springing up in the area, the doctors say, and the ‘very old and tired’ health centre simply cannot cope with the influx.

They applied to NHS England for permission to redevelop the building, but ‘we still have no news’. They applied for a grant to improve the centre ‘but, again, we have not heard anything more!’

They have had meetings with the local council but ‘despite our concerns, the council continues to grant planning permission and allow “new builds’’ in the area with no consultation.’

The bottom line? Sunbury Health Centre is 84 per cent undersized (the surgery’s phrase.) All this is true and has undoubtedly contributed to the crisis.

Almost 2,000 readers have commented in less than 24 hours on the Mail’s picture of dozens of patients queuing before dawn to see their GP. Here’s what some of them said: 

‘It shames the Government and local authorities who did not plan for such an increase in population. It does not shame Britain, it shames those whose job it is to plan for this!’

Tony, from Derbyshire

‘I gave up going to my GP and hospitals in 2009 and my local is not as bad as this. Our country has become over-crowded – we do not have the amenities to cope...’

Nelly, from Croydon, south London

‘We can’t get an appointment so we go to our local chemist and ask for advice. We have had to go to A&E a few times. If my children need to be seen within 24 hours due to ill health we go to A&E.’

Patient at Sunbury Health Centre, Surrey

‘This happens here where I live. My husband, who is healthy, has to queue, before they open, for me to be able to see a doctor. They won’t even open the doors and allow people to wait inside, no matter what the weather is.’

A reader from St Helens, Merseyside

‘I live in Cleethorpes and if you need to see a doctor that day you have to queue before 8am because you can’t get through on the phone. It’s engaged all the time.

‘Then, when you do get through, all the appointments have gone and you get told to come down the next day before 8am and you will get an appointment then. How Victorian is that?’

Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire

‘My surgery is exactly the same. People who’ve just come out of hospital, first- time mums with two-week-old babies, all queuing up in the dark or redialling 100-plus times to be told “We’re full. Try again tomorrow”.

‘Really, if you’re not quite fit and determined, you have no chance of getting an appointment. So why are they STILL advertising for new patients to join?’

Dulwich, south-east London

‘This seems to happen on every new housing development. There are no increased local amenities to match the increased demand.

‘It is down to local councillors to see that the development does not cause the problems seen here and there does appear to have been a massive failure when planning permission was granted. The local council should have an inquiry into that before the press do because it looks like a pretty serious breakdown in democracy.’ 

Southend, Essex

‘Most of those [patients] probably don’t really need to be there – they should be visiting their local pharmacy.

‘But no, they don’t want to pay for a pack of Paracetamol or a bottle of Calpol when they can get it free in prescription. These are the people draining the NHS, not the elderly who would not want to waste the GP’s time.’

Indeed, the surgery – now one of the biggest in Britain – occupies less than half the existing building (the other half is occupied by Virgin, a private health care provider, which is responsible for the district nursing team.) But is this the whole story?

The fact remains that more patients equals more money – for GPs. As its patient roll has increased, so has the NHS money flowing in to the surgery, which, like other practices, is paid £73.56 per patient a year. 

Or, to put it another way, 6,000 patients means £441,360, for Sunbury, but 19,000 patients means £1,397,640. Nor is this the full extent of the financial incentives for GPs

Under the latest GP contracts, they are also paid £7.64 for vaccinations such as flu and MMR jabs and £55 for every patient diagnosed with dementia; GPs qualify for the payment if they diagnose the patients themselves (with no checks as to whether their assessment is right), or if they update their records when their patients receive diagnosis in hospital.

Some GPs have condemned the scheme as an ‘ethical travesty’ which amounts to ‘cash for diagnosis’.

Either way, it means that a practice such as Sunbury – where patients have to queue at dawn to see their doctor – is also extremely lucrative. 

This is the perverse irony at the heart of this scandal. Once upon of time, of course, the NHS – and, in particular, the service provided by GPs – was the envy of the world. 

But under the new system, introduced by the last Labour government in 2004, doctors were allowed to opt out of evening and weekend work – which nine out of ten practices, including Sunbury, did.

This brought the average GP’s basic salary down to £55,000, but, at the same time, new rules on bonus pay contained in the deal pushed their average pre-tax pay above £100,000.

The new rules stated that GPs would earn bonuses for meeting certain performance targets – from distributing anti-smoking information to diagnosing illnesses such as depression. No cap was placed on the amount they could earn from the new contracts.

As for patients, well, the daily scene outside the Sunbury Health Centre speaks for itself. Behind those scenes are patients like pensioner Mr Samphire and other personal testimonies written, in black and white on the centre’s own website.

‘I called every ten minutes from 7am until 8.45am (when I finally spoke to someone to only be told that all the appointments had gone … looking to changing doctors. Wouldn’t wish this practice on my worst enemy,’ wrote one patient.Another added: ‘Tried for two hours to get past the engaged tone then waited in a queue of five to wait to be answered.’

A third revealed: ‘I have been on hold for 45 minutes, told I am caller number one for 35 minutes and still haven’t spoken to receptionist. When I tried the automated system yesterday, soonest appointment was a week’s time – even though the medical centre is next door to my house.’

The surgery was originally designed for 6,000 patients, but now serves nearly 19,000 (file picture)

The surgery has 12 GPs, four of them recruited in the past two years to cope with increased demand, and hopes to recruit more. But two new housing developments are also in the pipeline which are likely to place further strain on the oversubscribed health centre. The first of these, at the famous Kempton Park race track, could see more than 1,000 homes being built.

A second is an application to build 196 houses on the site of London Irish rugby club’s former training ground in Sunbury, which is currently going through the planning process at Spelthorne Borough Council.

‘The council would be very keen to support new or improved health facilities in Lower Sunbury,’ said head of planning John Brooks. ‘However, these need to be supported by the relevant health funding bodies. To date, they have not given us specific proposals and neither have they made specific funding requests.’

In fact, more GP practices than ever are reaching capacity and applying for permission to refuse new patients, with the number of requests to reject additional patients soaring by 160 per cent in three years, according to GP magazine Pulse.

Has the Sunbury Health Centre made such an application? After all, the surgery has blamed the crisis on a dramatic increase in the number of patients (19,000, remember) now on its roll?

A spokesman for the centre said no such request had been made ‘because closing the list would be detrimental to local people who may wish to register with us as patients.’
