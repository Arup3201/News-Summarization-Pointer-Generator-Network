A model charged with drunk driving after crashing her Porsche allegedly name-dropped former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to get out of it.

Dara Tomanovich, known for her turn in 1996 movie Bio-Dome and Oil of Olay ads, allegedly warned the cops she could get them fired, according to New York Post.

Police said the 45-year-old was bleary-eyed and stumbling when she crashed her car in the West Village about 11pm on July 16.

According to a criminal complaint, the former lingerie model said she was friends with Bloomberg and told a female officer, 'I can get you fired or transferred'.

Police told NY Post that Tomanovich failed two 
Breathalyzers, blowing .159 and .112 - both above the legal limit 
of .08.

She was charged with DWI and released without bail.

Bloomberg and Tomanovich have not commented publicly on the incident.

According to an IMDb bio, the Canada native's career took off when fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld cast her as the new lead model for the fashion house, Chloe, at the age of 18.

She lived and worked in Paris for five years, appearing on the cover of French Marie Claire and in advertisements for British Vogue.

She boasts about her lead role in Pauly Shore’s 1996 stoner flick Bio-Dome, as well as appearing in a Fiat commercial with George Clooney.

The small-time actress is due back in Manhattan Criminal Court September 18.
