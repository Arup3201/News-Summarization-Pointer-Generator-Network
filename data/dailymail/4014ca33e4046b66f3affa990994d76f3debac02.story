Thousands of Australians were today forced to abandon their homes as the worst floodwater for 35 years continued to rise.

At least one person has been killed as residents in Queensland and New South Wales are put on high alert over the state of 12 rivers.

Australia's coal industry, concentrated in the region, is said to be largely unaffected, easing concern about a repeat of last year's disastrous floods that sent global coal prices soaring.

But heavy rain is expected to take its toll on the region's agriculture, particularly on cotton, sugarcane, soybean and corn.    

Almost 4,000 people were evacuated from the Queensland town of St George, where flooding is expected to reach a record level of 45ft or higher, state police said.    

Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said: 'We're hearing from people whose families have lived on the property for 100 or more years who've never seen water in their homes who have now got water up to the roof.

'So we know that something that's never been seen before is on its way.'

St George was also hit in 2011, when flash floods across Queensland and New South Wales killed about 35 people, swamped 30,000 houses, and wiped out roads, bridges and rail lines.

The flooding across the two states this year has resulted in tens of thousands of people being cut off in the last few days, with some having to battle with deadly snakes as they scrambled for dry ground.     

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has forecast that flooding will continue for weeks in some areas.

The town of Moree, the centre of the New South Wales' cotton industry was cut in half by record floodwaters, and some estimated that each farm in the area could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of crops.

Australia is the world's largest coal exporter and accounts for roughly two-thirds of global trade of coking coal, used for steel production.

The 2011 floods pushed up global coal prices as production was brought to a near standstill.

Queensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche said: 'The coal mines themselves are not experiencing any difficulties. So far, the Queensland coal industry, as far as we are aware, has missed the flooding.'

On Friday, Whitehaven Coal said it had shut four mines because of heavy rain, but the mines were not flooded and no equipment had been damaged.

Global miner Xstrata said there was no impact on its operations. Spokesman Kathryn Lamond said: 'It's business as usual.'

But the industry was still concerned about disruption if there was no let-up in the rain and more flooding, Roche said.

Many mines are still carrying significant volumes of water from last year's floods, so more heavy rain is a danger.

Storm damage was estimated to have cut Australia's commodity-weighted economy's gross domestic product growth by A$20 billion, or 1.5 per cent, in the 2010-2011 financial year.
