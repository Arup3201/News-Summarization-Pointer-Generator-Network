A Chicago woman is suing her plastic surgeon for publishing before and after pictures of her 'cocaine nose' online.

In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court, 55-year-old Sabrina Kropp claims her surgeon, Dr Robert Walton, posted the pictures without her permission on a website advertising his new practice, Plastic Surgery Chicago LLC.

Now she is suing the 68-year-old surgeon claiming the pictures caused her to suffer 'great harm'. 

Kropp says the pictures were taken in 2004, and were supposed to be confidential.

But just last year, she saw them posted on a website for Walton's new practice which described the different procedures he performs.

The before pictures describe Kropp's nose as having 'perforation of the septum, infection, loss of supporting cartilage, scarring and eventual collapse of the nose' which can happen after cocaine abuse.

Three pictures after surgery show Kropp's reconstructed nose, which is now more acute. In both the before and after pictures, Kropp's eyes were covered with black boxes so as to keep her identitiy a secret.

Dr Walton has since taken the pictures 
down from the website, but the website is still live and the pictures 
can be accessed from an internet archive.

Kropp says Dr Walton should have known that publishing the pictures would cause her 'to become distressed, shamed and embarrassed'.

In the lawsuit, she says the doctor and his practice violated her confidentiality and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) which requires a patient's written consent before disclosing protected health information.

Also listed as a defendant in the lawsuit is the University of  Chicago Medical Center, which employed Dr Walton at the time of Kropp's surgery.
