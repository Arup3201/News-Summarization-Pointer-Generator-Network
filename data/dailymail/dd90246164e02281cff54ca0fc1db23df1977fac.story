'Bad mother': Courtney Addington, 24, was arrested and charged with murder for allegedly leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash bag in January

A 24-year-ld California woman has been arrested after police say she killed her newborn baby and then attempted to cover up the crime by feigning an illness.

Courtney Addington, of Sacramento, was taken into custody Tuesday morning in connection to the death of her baby in January.

The 24-year-old has been charged with murder following a three-month investigation and was ordered held without bail at the Sacramento County Main Jail, CBS Sacramento reported.

Addington was admitted to Mercy General Hospital on January 25 suffering from uncontrollable vaginal bleeding.

A medical examination and a pregnancy test soon revealed that she had recently given birth, but the patient insisted that her bleeding was caused by irritable bowel syndrome, according to court documents cited by Sacramento Bee. 

Hospital staff became suspicious and notified police. Deputies were dispatched to Addington's home in the 3800 block of Wildrose Way, where they found the lifeless body of a newborn wrapped in a white garbage bag and stashed under a bed with the placenta and umbilical cord still attached.

In another bag, law enforcement officials discovered bloody towels.

Failed ruse: Addington was admitted to Mercy General Hospital with severe bleeding, which she blamed on irritable bowel syndrome even though tests showed that she had recently given birth

The baby was identified in the criminal complaint as Hayden Elaine. Deputies allege that Addington had caused the child's death, although it has not been determined how the infant died.

Autopsy performed on the baby only indicated that the child was born alive and breathed after delivery.

‘Everything points to the fact she put the baby in the bag,’ Sheriff's Sgt. Jason Ramos said.

According to her Facebook page, Addington, a native of Antelope, went to California State University, Chico, and later studied performing Arts at American River College.

Child abuse detective Janae Galovich wrote in a request for an arrest warrant that Addington's boyfriend - who was the father of the baby - as well as her family 'all suspected she was pregnant due to her growing stomach and wearing baggy clothing.'

Whenever confronted about her changing body, Addington would deny pregnancy and attribute it to her IBS.

But
when interviewed by detectives, the 24-year-old's doctor said that 
Addington had never been diagnosed with the condition, and had never 
been prescribed medication for it.

Web of lies: Addington's boyfriend and relatives noticed that she was gaining weight and wearing baggy clothes to cover her stomach, but the woman repeatedly denied pregnancy and blamed the changes on IBS

During the three-month investigation, officials conducted a forensic review of Addington's cell phone, which revealed that just days before the delivery, the woman searched online for ‘IBS medications’; ‘Signs of water breaking?’ and ‘How to stop loss of blood.’

Sgt Ramos said it is believed that Addington gave birth on her own at home and then asked an unsuspecting family member to drive her to the hospital.

Officials pointed out that California has a Safely Surrender Baby Law that allows women to leave a newborn in a hospital or a fire station within 72 hours of delivery without retribution.
