A pensioner fell out of her wheelchair and died after her friend who was pushing her tried to photograph some ducklings with her iPad, an inquest heard.

Jean Sloan, 81, was being pushed by Jane Miller when they stopped to watch a duck and ducklings near a pond.

She asked her friend to photograph the birds and Mrs Miller let go of the wheelchair as she reached for her iPad to take a photo.

Tragedy: Wheelchair-bound Jean Sloan died after the friend pushing her let go to photograph ducklings

Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake said: 'As she did so the chair moved forward. She did go to grab it, but then Mrs Sloan then fell out of the chair.'

Mrs Miller ran for help after Mrs Sloan fell near the Walcot Hall nursing home where she lived in Diss, Norfolk.

Paramedics were called, but the pensioner, who had been in a wheelchair since having a stroke last August, died at the scene on June 25.

Verdict: Norfolk Coroner's Court (pictured) returned a verdict of accidental death after an investigation

Mrs Miller said in a statement that the wheelchair had not been on a noticeable slope.

A post mortem found mother-of-two Mrs Sloan had died from a ruptured spleen due to the fall.

It also found there were contributory factors of heart disease which were not directly linked to the cause of death.

Mrs Lake said police had investigated and were satisfied there was nothing suspicious and there were no problems with the wheelchair.

She added: 'In the light of the events leading to her death my conclusion is accidental death.'
