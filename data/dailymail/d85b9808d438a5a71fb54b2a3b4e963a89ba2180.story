An inventor who appeared on TV's Dragons' Den turned to crime - by inventing 43 different fake identities.

Smooth-talking Andrew Cunningham, 46, pretended to be a James Bond stuntman, a grieving father and a lord among dozens of phoney IDs.

A court today heard how he fooled 159 different doctors to swindle the NHS out of more than 22,000 drugs.

Prosecutor Jason Howells said: 'Cunningham made 159 visits to doctors across the country using 43 false identities.

'He would make up elaborate stories to explain why he was in the area often claiming he was a stuntman on a new James Bond movie.

'He'd sometimes say he was an ex-Marine working away from home as a weapons and ballistic advisor for the film industry.

'Other times he claimed his son had just died in Afghanistan and he was back in the area to attend the funeral.'

The court heard Cunningham even changed his passport to use the name Lord Andrew McDonald Cunningham.

Cunningham hoped for fame and fortune when he appeared on the Dragons' Den TV show in 2008 - pitching his idea to put special personal designs and logos to hard hats for the building industry.

But Dragons Theo Paphitis and Duncan Ballatyne didn't fall for his invention - and refused to hand over their cash.

The business gurus rejected his invention saying 'anyone creative' could customise their hard hat with stickers or stencilling.

Cunningham's dream of being a wealthy businessman was finally scuppered when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court for his fraud.

The court heard Cunningham became addicted to prescription painkillers - and drove his green Jaguar sports car to GP surgeries over 100 miles apart.

Sallie Cheung, a NHS counter fraud specialist, said: 'The lies where so audacious that people just didn't think to question them.'

In November 2009 Cunningham, using the name of Mitchell Bradley, presented himself at a Gloucestershire surgery asking for codeine phosphate.

He received a prescription but a suspicious doctor rang the hotel where he said he was staying.

The hotel had no record of him - so the surgery contacted NHS investigators.

They spoke to other doctors in the area and found many of them had been visited by a mystery man matching Cunningham's description.

Leighton Hughes, defence, said: 'The degree of invention in Cunningham's stories may look like cunning and manipulation but it's just that he is a very intelligent man.

'For example he made a lot of money developing an invention and after he appeared on Dragons' Den he sold his patent for the invention in the USA.'

But the court heard a lot of the cash went on hotel rooms as he travelled as far as Hereford, Somerset and Swansea to trick GPs he was staying overnight.

Cunningham, of Rhiwbina, Cardiff, admitted making false approaches to NHS staff. He was given a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work.

He was also ordered to pay Â£4,000 in compensation and costs.

Lee Sheridan, the officer in charge of the investigation, said: 'This should serve as a message to those who think misusing NHS resources and time is acceptable.

'Counter fraud teams across the country are working closely together and sharing information, so we will catch you.'
