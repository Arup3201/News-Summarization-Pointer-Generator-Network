A California board has again approved parole for former Charles Manson follower and convicted double murderer Bruce Davis.

The department of corrections first granted the 71-year-old parole in 2012, but Governor Jerry Brown vetoed the decision after a public outcry and opposition from the families of Manson victims.

Brown now has 30 days to decide whether he'll oppose the decision again.

Paid the price? Charles Manson follower Bruce Davis (left as he appears now and right after the 1969 double murder) was convicted of double homicide and has been in prison in California since. He was deemed suitable for parole once again

The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation granted parole to Davis after a hearing Wednesday at the California Men's Colony.

The decision is subject to a 120-day decision review period, reports NBC News.

Brown spokesman Jim Evans said in an email Wednesday that he could not comment beyond the parole board's statement.

Davis has been in prison since he was convicted of aiding in the murders of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald 'Shorty' Shea in 1972 in a case that was a postscript to Manson's notorious reign as leader of the murderous cult known as the Manson family.

Brown rejected the original parole it last March, saying he wanted Davis to reveal more details about the killings.

Governor
 Arnold Schwarzenegger blocked Davisâ€™s release years before that, saying
 he â€˜would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society.â€™

The parole bid was opposed by a former Manson family member, Barbara Hoyt, as well as Sharon Tate's sister, Debra Tate.

The 71-year-old Manson family member has won parole before, but seen it blocked by Governors Brown and Schwarzenegger

Frightening: Davis has been in prison since he was convicted of aiding in the murders of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald 'Shorty' Shea in 1972 in a case that was a postscript to Manson's notorious reign as leader of the murderous cult known as the Manson family

Davis long maintained he was a bystander in the killings of the two men but in recent years he acknowledged his shared responsibility because he was present.

Davis became a born-again Christian in prison and ministered to other inmates, married and divorced a woman he met through the prison ministry, and has a grown daughter.

Davis also earned a master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy of religion.

Few followers of the infamous Manson cult have been released from prison.

Steve Grogan, who was convicted with Davis, was freed in 1985 after he led police to Shea's buried body.

Lynette 'Squeaky' Fromme was released from prison in 2009 after serving time for the attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford.

Manson and two of his followers, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel, remain in prison for life in the Tate killings.

Their co-defendant, Susan Atkins, died of cancer behind bars in 2009. Another of the Tate killers, Charles 'Tex' Watson, is still in prison.

Opposition: Barbara Hoyt, left, a former member of the Manson Family, and Debra Tate, sister of Manson Family murder victim Sharon Tate, moments before the start of Bruce Davis' last parole hearing in 2012. Davis has long denied he ever actually killed anyone and was not present for Tate's murder

Manson and his 'Family' became some of the 20th century's most infamous criminals in the summer of 1969, when he directed his mostly young, female followers to murder seven people in what prosecutors said was part of a plan to incite a race war between whites and blacks.

Among the victims was actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski. She was stabbed 16 times by members of the cult in the early morning hours of August 9, 1969.

Four other people were also stabbed or shot to death at Tate's home that night by the Manson followers, who scrawled the word "Pig" in blood on the front door before leaving.

The following night, Manson's group stabbed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca to death, using their blood to write "Rise," "Death to Pigs" and "Healter Skelter" - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song "Helter Skelter" - on the walls and refrigerator door.

Davis did not take part in those murders.

Manson was originally sentenced to death for the murder spree that horrified the nation in the late 1960s but was spared execution after the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional in 1972.

Now 79, he is serving a life sentence at Corcoran State Prison for the seven Tate-LaBianca killings and the murder of Hinman. He has been repeatedly denied parole.
