A card arrives at my villa at Landaa Giraavaru, Maldives.

'Dear Sue, we will be waiting for you at 7pm at the main jetty.'

With the note is a parcel containing a sarong.

'Please wear this for our special evening.'

A life on an ocean wave: The Four Seasons resort in the Maldives has its own luxury boat, Explorer

We meet on the jetty in our sarongs and are guided to a super-smart double-decker motor launch. There is champagne, canapes and the perfect sunset. All fabulous, but in this neck of the luxury woods - where dining is not just about the food, it is about ingenuity - not unique.

Then as dusk falls the secret of the evening is revealed.

We are dropped off on a sandbank 150ft long, 50ft wide and about two inches above the sea. A bar has been dug out of the sand with oval seating and we are served rum cocktails in coconuts by candlelight. The entertainment is crab-racing - I select number 27, my birthday - and it wins.

Dinner is called and we walk along a lantern-lit path until we reach the table, again dug into the sand with seating either side. It is laid up formally, with white linen, silver cutlery, too many wine glasses to count, flowers and a menu card.

Each course has a title.

Following the amuse bouche is After The Sunset, then Setting The Mood, The Moon Has Come Out, Shooting Stars and The Sound Of The Waves, and each course is served with its own wine chosen by the Fours Seasons' sommelier and, I have to admit it, I am blown away.

'Can you believe we are sitting in the middle of the Indian Ocean under a full moon, eating brulee out of a pineapple on a sand table?' said my friend, Kate. Actually no. It was pinch-yourself time.

Not a bad location to enjoy the sunset: The resort has suites which rank as the size of most houses

The trouble with paradise, say some, is that there is nothing to do. But they miss the point. The Maldives is a Disneyland for adults.

Palm trees and pale powder beaches, a translucent, turquoise sea full of fish with names like parrot, surgeon and emperor angel, and the scent of bougainvillea, hibiscus and frangipani everywhere. It's pure Castaway, only with air-con, wi-fi and your very own Man Friday.

There are around a hundred resorts, each on its own island, and what sets each apart is not geography but style and service.

Four Seasons has the answer for anyone who fears that they will get bored staying on one small island - a few nights each at Kuda Huraa and Landaa Giraavaru, punctuated by a stay on Explorer, a luxury three-deck cruiser. The sandbank dinner is part of the itinerary for the boat stay, although it won't appear in the brochure. The secret is part of the surprise.

We spent one night on the boat travelling between resorts. I rose at 6am from my queen-sized bed in the cream-carpeted cabin for a sunrise snorkel with the resident marine biologist.

Soon we were swimming among hundreds of yellow and blue striped sweetlip and an army of fusiliers. The biologist pointed to the cornets, easy to spot with their long and skinny bodies, and the butterflies, brown and white with a long nose, and she enlightened me on the difference between an emperor angel fish, left, and damsel angel.

We also ticked off masked bannerfish, a dog tooth tuna, a giant moray (eel) and porcupine fish.

It is difficult to decide which resort I liked best. Kuda Huraa, just 25 minutes by boat from the airport, scores on convenience, and the spa on its own little island is gorgeous.

A swirl of colours and shapes: The waters of the Maldives teem with fabulous fish and bright wildlife

But several things at the larger Landaa Giraavaru won it over for me. The first was being given a Manta On Call service, which would alert me if the manta rays, which measure about 5ft and for which the region is famed, were sighted (sadly, they weren't).

Second was the beach - a headway separates two parts of the lagoon and the view is out of this world. Third was the service (chocolate popsicles handed out by the pool, a sunglasses butler and a chief engineer who repaired my glasses after I stepped on them) and fourth was, of course, the sandbank dinner.
