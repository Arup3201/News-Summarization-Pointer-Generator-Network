London Fashion Week is now in full swing - the time when the capital's best, worst and strangest fashionistas display their style on the street as a badge of honour. 

While most of us can make neither head nor tail of the odd outfits seen on the bloggers, fashion journalists, models and buyers heading into the shows, once thing is for sure - in six months time, many of the looks will been on sale on Britain's high streets. 

To give you a head start on some of the trends for 2015, FEMAIL has rounded up some of the most popular items of clothing spotted on the UK's most style conscious as they entered the catwalk shows this weekend.

Blue fur, slogan handbags and football scarves were just a few of the outlandish trends that have featured on bloggers, fashion journalists and models at London Fashion Week so far (Pictured from left to right: Bloggers Gizele Oliveira, Pernille Teisbaek and Susie Bubble)

Blue fur, maroon leather and slogan handbags have all featured on the glamorous women at London Fashion Week so far, carried off with varying degrees of style. 

On the more bizarre end of the scale, football scarves, Calvin Klein underwear and hats made out of lego were also on show. 

But while it may be easy to fit in on the Front Row in some of these get-ups, it will be harder to to blend in while doing the weekly shop at Sainsbury's.

The easier trends to copy included midi skirts and bright yellow accessories or sheepskin coats - all easy enough to incorporate into a normal wardrobe. 

Read on to find out what you'll most likely be coveting in a few months time... 

MIDI SKIRTS:  

Midi skirts were everywhere this weekend - paired with ladylike roll-necks and blazers or baggy sweatshirts and chunky boots.

FOOTBALL SCARVES:  

While we admit that we only spotted one football scarf at London Fashion Week, it was around the neck of style icon Susie Bubble, which counts for at least ten of your average fashion bloggers. 

Susie was sporting an Arsenal scarf with her Simone Rocha dress on Saturday afternoon. 

Possibly the only trend of the bunch that will get the thumbs up from your boyfriend.

MAROON LEATHER:  

The chilly temperatures meant many of the LFW attendees relied on their trusty leather coats and trousers to keep warm. 

Maroon leather in particular, was a popular sight.

SLOGAN BAGS:  

Not many of these women needed help making a statement, but plenty of them took some extra assistance in the form of a slogan bag. 

Handbags with with phrases were plentiful on the  streets outside the catwalk shows.

SHEEPSKIN COATS:  

When schlepping from one show to the next, it is imperative to keep cosy.

So it should come as little surprise that many fashionistas opted for sheepskin or shearling coats.

THE COOKIE MONSTER:  

Sesame Street doesn't often get credited for being fashion forward, but FEMAIL saw a likeness to the Cookie Monster everywhere this London Fashion Week. 

Whether it was blue pompoms or blue faux fur, fluffy aqua-coloured coats were at many of the shows.

CALVIN KLEIN UNDERWEAR:   

Calvin Klein underwear was the height of fashion in the Nineties and it's clearly making a comeback. 

Electric shock hairdo is not a compulsory accessory.

BURSTS OF BRIGHT YELLOW:  

It is hard to stand out at LFW, but the following ladies managed it with their bright yellow accessories. 

A bright pop of citrus colour was a big theme this weekend.

ADIDAS TRAINERS: 

Much like a warm coat, trainers are an essential when spending a week zigzagging across London to various fashion shows. 

This February, the brand of the moment was Adidas - featured on the shows of many fashionistas.

LEGO HATS:  

We're not sure much of this woman's look is likely to take off, but she gets full marks for effort. 

And if Lego hats end up being THE trend for 2015... well, you heard it here first.
