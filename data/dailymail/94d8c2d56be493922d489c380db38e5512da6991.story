Detectives leading the search for missing mother Samantha Henderson are appealing for the public's help

A desperate search was under way last night for a devoted young mother of four whom police fear has been murdered.

Samantha Henderson, 25, whose children are one, two, four and six, was last seen in Corfe Castle, Dorset, on Wednesday.

Detectives said they ‘strongly believe [Miss Henderson] may have come to some harm’.

Police helicopters have scoured the area, while 35 major crime officers and forensics experts combed allotments, outbuildings and the missing mother’s home.

A 27-year-old man from the village, believed to be her boyfriend, was arrested on Friday on suspicion of her murder. 

Last night detectives were granted more time to question him.

At least 30 friends and neighbours joined the search and put up hundreds of posters.

Detectives seized Miss Henderson’s blue Peugeot from her home last night and asked the public to help trace the car’s movements – especially between 3pm on Wednesday and 10.25am on Thursday.

Dorset Police said she was a ‘prolific phone user’ but that her mobile had not been found. 

Miss Henderson lives in a £325,000 four-bedroom cottage. It is believed her partner lived there for several years, but there is a ‘for sale’ sign outside and she had arranged to meet a house clearance firm yesterday.

The mother, who was described by neighbours as a ‘nice and bubbly girl’, was last seen collecting her children from Corfe Castle Primary School at 3pm on Wednesday. She is thought to have vanished from her home at about 4.30pm. She was not reported missing until 8.43am the next day.

Miss Henderson is described as 5ft 3in and very slim, with blonde hair. Yesterday her friend Lisa Jane Bonfield, who organised the poster campaign, said: ‘Hopefully someone will see it and recognise her or maybe she will see it and know we are looking for her and just want her back.’

The young woman's family described her as 'a loving mother' and said her disappearance was 'out of character'

Another friend, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Samantha is such a devoted mum … She and her partner have worked hard to give everything to [the children] … We’re still hoping she will be found alive.’

Miss Henderson’s family said: ‘Sam is a homely, private, loving mother … hardworking, always presentable and this is completely out of character … she would never walk out and leave her children.’

They added: ‘No one is upset or thinks anything badly of you, Sam. We just want you to come home as everyone wants to help and support you.’ 

Detective Inspector Neil Devoto said Miss Henderson had never gone missing before and that police had grave concerns for her.

Anyone with information should call Dorset Police on 101, quoting Operation Cavalier. Or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
