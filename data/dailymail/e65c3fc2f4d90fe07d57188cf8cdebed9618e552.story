The mother of a terminally ill child who may not live to see another winter transformed her garden into a snowy winter wonderland as a surprise.

Melodie Williams, 41, from Rowley Regis near Dudley in the West Midlands, asked local businesses to help with the surprise after deciding she had to make the most of the time she had left with her three-year-old son, Mason.

Little Mason, who was born with half a heart and needs a heart and lung transplant, will only be put on the transplant list if his blood pressure goes down - so his mother wanted him to play in snow in case he never got another chance.

Terminally-ill Mason Williams, three, gasps in delight as he looks at the winter wonderland in his back garden with his mother, Melodie, 41

Joy: Mason was born with a heart condition but is not well enough to have the life-saving operation he needs

The mother of five asked people in her area for help to transform her garden and local firms donated trees and lights and organised for 400 litres of snow to be imported to her garden.

Mrs Williams said: 'I just had to do something now in case he's not alive next time it snows.'

'If I didn't do it now, and something happens to him, I'd never forgive myself for not making the most of the time we had.'

Her youngest son was born with 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome, in which the left ventricle is 
under-developed at birth.  He also has a rare chromosome disorder which 
means he has severe learning difficulties and is unable to speak.

Mason has undergone a series of operations at Birmingham Children's Hospital to re-plumb his heart so that one ventricle can do the work of two, but pressure in his lungs means he is unable to undergo the final stages of the life-saving procedure.

Mrs Williams said: 'I had a meeting with the cardiologist and he said Mason's blood pressure was too high for him to have an operation to extend his life.

So happy: Little Mason spent more than an hour playing in the snow in his garden in Rowley Regis near Dudley

'He said if Mason has the operation now, his heart would not be able to cope with the high pressures of the blood and he would die on the operating table.'

She added: 'If his condition does not improve he will not be put on the heart and lung transplant list.

'Right now we're waiting until his pressures go down or the half of his heart that works gives out.'

Mrs Williams said: 'I am so grateful to everyone who helped us -  I'm so lucky that I could make this happen for Mason.'

She added: 'When he woke up and stepped out of the front door he was so shocked.  He laughed and giggled as he touched the snow, he can't speak but I knew he was loving his treat.

'Watching him was amazing, I will remember it forever.'

Firms that helped make Mason's 
surprise happen include Hollywood snow company, Snowbusiness, which 
imported real snow for Mason to play in, and his local Asda which 
donated lights, trees and decorations.
