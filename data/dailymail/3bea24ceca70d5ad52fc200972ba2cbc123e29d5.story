Consumers have been warned not to eat Quorn frozen vegetarian burger patties because they may contain pieces of hard, blue plastic.

Simplot Australia, the distributor of UK-made Quorn products in Australia, is recalling Quorn Meat Free Soy Free Classic Burgers, which are sold in Coles, Woolworths and Bi-Lo supermarkets across Australia.

'Simplot is greatly concerned at any risks to our consumers. This recall is being undertaken to ensure the safety of our consumers,' the company said in a statement.

'Consumers should not eat this product and should return it to the place of purchase for a full cash refund.

'We apologise for any inconvenience.'

The affected boxes of frozen burgers carry the expiry date 'Best Before December 31 2014'.

The Quorn Australia Facebook page has been hit by customer complaints following the revelation.

'Geez I have these often I wonder how much plastic my son and I have consumed,' Felicia Henderson wrote.

Meanwhile Emily Pope said: 'I'm even more worried! I like so many others had a stockpile of these... worst thing is, [our] packet did have blue flecks and I was feeling quite awful after. I thought it was perhaps just some colour action from the packet.' 

A customer service representative told customers the problem was caused by an 'isolated manufacturing malfunction' at a supplier site.

'We are now visiting the suppliers involved in making the product to establish exactly what has happened and to take steps to prevent it happening again,' they wrote.

The Quorn Classic Burgers are manufactured in the UK.

Their main ingredient is mycoprotein, a highly processed type of protein developed from fungus.

It was first produced in the 1980s, after more than two decades of research, over fears overpopulation would lead to global food shortages.
