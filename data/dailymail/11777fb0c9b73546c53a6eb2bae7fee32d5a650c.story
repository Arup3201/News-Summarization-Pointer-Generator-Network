Regret: Amanda Chadwick, above, said she will have to deal with the guilt of the murder for the rest of her life

The mistress who believed her lover’s lie that his suspicious wife had died in an accident – and carried on their affair after her death – has spoken for the first time about the shattering aftermath after he was found guilty of murder.

Amanda Chadwick broke down in tears as she spoke of her guilt at being duped by welder Alan Evans, who was jailed for life last week for killing his wife Louise after she confronted him about the affair.

Chadwick, 30, a mother-of two, admitted that she was blinded by love for Evans. She sobbed: ‘It’s because of me that a lovely little family has been destroyed. It’s my fault. Why did she have to die?

‘I trusted him, I believed everything he told me. This is hard. I’ve spent the last year of my life living a lie. I thought Al was innocent.

‘I have lost everything. I’ve got to deal with this even though its never going to go away. ‘I’ve got to deal with the guilt for the rest of my life.’

Chadwick, who gave evidence during the trial but was not there to hear the verdict, said she could not explain why she had had the affair.

She said she was lucky that Evans had not turned on her as well, saying: ‘I think it could have been me. Yes, at least I’m alive.’

She added: ‘I don’t want my children to go through any more. My son is seven and my daughter is 11. She’s taken Lou’s death very hard because she was a friend.

‘Whatever I say, nothing is going to change what people think of me.’

Chadwick’s mother Jayne said her daughter was ‘absolutely devastated’. She said: ‘She thought he  was innocent. Him being found guilty was a shock because she trusted him.

Guilty: Alan Evans left, murdered his wife, Louise, left, by throwing her down the stairs after a row

‘She has been made to look terrible in the media. It’s not the person she is. We are a really nice family. She’s my daughter. I have to protect her. She needs to protect her children.’

Chadwick’s four–month affair with Evans began after the pair met in the playground of the school she worked at as a teaching assistant. Her two children attended the school as did his daughters – twins aged six and a five-year-old.

The couple began meeting regularly so their children could play together but the friendship soon escalated and they would book rooms at low-cost hotels or even share each other’s marital beds when their partners were away.

Evans sent Chadwick thousands of text messages, many of a sexually explicit nature, and she sent him thousands back.

Evans, who worked as a welder, claimed during 
the trial his 32-year-old wife (pictured) had tripped and fallen as he 
slept in the lounge on the night of July 9 last year

To disguise the affair, Evans encouraged his wife, a care worker, to make friends with Chadwick  and her husband, and the couples would go for walks together.

Evans admitted to the court that his wife was suspicious.

Mrs Evans, a care worker, confronted him after she discovered evidence of the text messages, and warned Chadwick that she would report her to the school.

Evans successfully begged his wife of 12 years to stay with him and promised to break contact with Chadwick. He persuaded his mistress to send him texts making it look like their relationship was over. But the couple continued to plan for a life together, even talking about having children.

Worcester Crown Court heard how, on July 9, Evans, 35, pushed his wife Louise, 32, down the stairs at their home and put a skipping rope next to her body to make it look like an accident.

He also placed a vacuum cleaner at the top of the stairs and claimed that she tripped and fell while he was asleep on the sofa in the living room of their home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire.

The court heard that Evans had pushed or thrown her down the stairs after punching her four  times, then smothered her as she  lay unconscious.

Three months after his wife’s death, Evans and Chadwick went on holiday to Wales as a couple to celebrate her mother’s birthday, where she introduced him to her family. The court was shown photographs of the pair cuddling together on a beach in Wales.

In a victim impact statement read to the court after the verdict, Mrs Evans’s mother said she could not believe Evans had rekindled his affair with his mistress after killing his wife.

Judy Bollen said: ‘How could he? I just thought, “Louise is still in a freezer at the mortuary and he  is starting a life with  that woman who hurt her so much”.

‘Louise was unhappy for the final months of her life because of them, and he was just carrying on like she meant nothing.’

She added: ‘How do we tell three little girls that their daddy murdered their mummy?’

Chadwick now lives in South Wales, after moving away from Kidderminster with her children and has split from her husband.
