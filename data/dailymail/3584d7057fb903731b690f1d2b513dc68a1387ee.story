Vindication: Christopher Jefferies had been critical of Avon and Somerset Police's handling of his detention, bail and subsequent release without charge over Miss Yeates' death

Police have issued an apology to the landlord of murdered Jo Yeates for not publicly clearing him as a suspect in her death soon enough.

Christopher Jefferies received a letter from Avon and Somerset police expressing 'regret' for the first time at the way he was treated after being arrested over Miss Yeates' murder.

The retired teacher, 68, hailed what he described as 'public vindication' from Avon and Somerset Police over its handling of his detention, bail and subsequent release without charge after 25-year-old Miss Yeates’ death in December 2010.

The 'letter of exoneration expressing
regret' from Chief Constable Nick Gargan - who met the retired teacher 
last Friday - acknowledged the 'hurt' caused to Mr Jefferies when the force failed to clear him publicly of suspicion over 
Miss Yeates’ murder when releasing him from bail in March 2011.

In the letter, Chief Constable Gargan acknowledged: 'The police did not 
make it clear publicly that you were no longer a suspect in the 
investigation as soon as you were released from bail on March 5, 2011.'

Responding to the apology, Mr Jefferies said: 'It provides an important conclusion to the whole aftermath of what I had to go through following my arrest.

'As
the letter itself explains it provides the public vindication which was
not given at the time I was released from police bail.

'Although
the letter is addressed to me and is therefore expressing regret at 
what I had to endure, the letter also implicitly provides the public 
acceptance that the events didn’t just affect me but affected a large 
circle of my relatives and friends.'

Mr Jefferies was arrested on December 30 2010 and questioned by detectives for two days before being bailed after Miss Yeates was found dead on Christmas Day.

Manhunt: Police launched a massive hunt to find the killer of Joanna Yeates, pictured on CCTV in the hours before she was murdered by neighbour Vincent Tabak

Dutch national Vincent Tabak, who 
lived next door to her and her boyfriend Greg Reardon, 27, at 44 Canynge
Road, Bristol, was jailed for life in October 2011 for her murder.

Mr Jefferies won damages from eight newspapers over stories about him after his arrest.

As well as paying damages to the former Clifton College teacher, the publishers of the Mirror and the Sun were respectively fined £50,000 and £18,000, plus legal costs after being found guilty of contempt of court.

Avon and Somerset police also 
revealed they compensated Mr Jefferies for damage to his property done 
during the murder investigation, but they refused to divulge exactly how
much.

A force spokesman said: 'We settled a
claim in relation to damage at Mr Jefferies’ properties and the loss of
rental income. While the properties were secured as a crime scenes some
damage had occurred as a result of specialist crime scene investigation
and forensic testing.

'As part of the murder investigation it was necessary for the crime scene to be preserved until the end of the trial. '

During Tabak’s trial it was revealed the killer had implicated Mr Jefferies by phoning the police and making false claims.

'I accept unequivocally that you played no part in the murder and that you are wholly innocent of the crime.'

'I understand the length of 
time you spent on police bail caused you significant distress and 
inevitably prolonged the period of time when you remained in the public 
eye as someone who was still suspected of involvement in an appalling 
crime.

'The police did not 
make it clear publicly that you were no longer a suspect in the 
investigation as soon as you were released from bail on March 5, 2011.

'While
it is not normal practice to make such a public statement, in the 
circumstances of the exceptional media attention your arrest attracted I
acknowledge we should have considered this and I am very sorry for the 
suffering you experienced as a result.'

Mr Gargan joined Avon and Somerset from the the National Policing Improvement Agency in March, replacing Colin Port, who was in charge at the time of the murder.

In his letter to Mr Jefferies, Mr Gargan said the pensioner’s arrest was an 'integral step' in the investigation, but added: 'I accept unequivocally that you played no part in the murder and that you are wholly innocent of the crime.'

He added: 'I understand the length of 
time you spent on police bail caused you significant distress and 
inevitably prolonged the period of time when you remained in the public 
eye as someone who was still suspected of involvement in an appalling 
crime.

'The police did not 
make it clear publicly that you were no longer a suspect in the 
investigation as soon as you were released from bail on March 5, 2011.

'While
it is not normal practice to make such a public statement, in the 
circumstances of the exceptional media attention your arrest attracted I
acknowledge we should have considered this and I am very sorry for the 
suffering you experienced as a result.'

He also said that all DNA, fingerprints and photographs taken of Mr Jefferies after his arrest had been destroyed.

In a statement Mr Gargan said the force stood by the decision to arrest the landlord.

'The
media attention and vilification to which Christopher Jefferies was 
subjected during the Joanna Yeates murder investigation was 
unprecedented, and I understand how difficult it must have been for 
him,' he said.

'It was a complex investigation, 
carried out under the most intense public scrutiny and the investigating
officer had to pursue every reasonable line of enquiry.

'Although
I was not chief constable then, I stand by the decision taken at the 
time to arrest and interview Christopher Jefferies.

'Nevertheless
I am happy to accede to his request that we should make it clear that 
he was completely exonerated in this investigation.

'This is an unusual step to take but these were exceptional circumstances.

'I
had a private meeting with Mr Jefferies on Friday and hope to use his 
experience to inform our serious crime investigations in the future.'

Mr Jefferies gave evidence at the 
Leveson Inquiry into press standards, with its final report saying 
reporting around the former teacher’s arrest had been 'unbalanced, 
prejudicial and wildly inaccurate' and calling him 'the victim of a very
serious injustice perpetrated by a significant section of the press'.

Mr
Jefferies also released a letter today, sent to him by Mr Port in 
January last year, denying Mr Jefferies’ name had been deliberately 
released to the media.

It was sent after Daily Mirror editor Richard Wallace told the Leveson Inquiry police had given off-the-record briefings in which they appeared confident that Mr Jefferies 'was their man'.

In the letter, referred to by Mr Jefferies in his Leveson witness statement, Mr Port said the editor’s evidence was 'untrue', adding: 'There was an inadvertent disclosure of your name following news reports naming you but as soon as we discovered this had taken place we made it clear to the journalist the information should not have been released and should not be used.'
