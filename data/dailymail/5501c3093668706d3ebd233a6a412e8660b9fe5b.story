An alleged killer accused of murdering two pensioners has claimed they were attacked by an intruder and a Polish man who went 'absolutely wild' after a sexual encounter.

Leo Barnes told jurors he witnessed assaults on Cynthia Beamond and Philip Silverstone, and had done nothing to harm them at their respective homes in the West Midlands and London.

Barnes is accused of murdered Mrs Beamond, 80, and Mr Silverstone, 67, on consecutive days in June last year. 

Cynthia Beamond (left) was killed in her home in Birmingham last year. Leo Barnes (right) is accused of her murder and the killing of another man, Philip Silverstone, in his north London home the following day

Giving evidence on the fourth day of his trial, Barnes told jurors that Mrs Beamond was struck over the head with a saucepan by an intruder who then ordered him to clean up a trail of blood.

Barnes said he believed he had been followed to Mrs Beamond's home in Halesowen, by three men who robbed him of drugs, cash and a mobile phone at gunpoint.

The 33-year-old, from Birmingham, said the attack on Mrs Beamond and subsequent threats not to speak about it, had left him 'absolutely terrified'. 

Barnes told jurors at Wolverhampton Crown Court: 'They just came from nowhere. They said 'Look, you are getting robbed, keep your mouth closed'. '

Barnes, who denies two counts of murder, said he thought Mrs Beamond, who he knew from childhood, was still alive when he left her house.

Mrs Beamond's body was found hidden under storage in the garage of her home in Halesown, Birmingham

The following day, Barnes told the court, he drove to London, arriving at Mr Silverstone's flat in Belsize Park at about 11pm.

Inside the property, Barnes said, Mr Silverstone was sitting with his wife and a man he was told was Polish.

After informing jurors that he is bisexual, Barnes told the court that he went into a bedroom with the Polish man and paid him £80 to have sex.

He said: 'I had a sexual encounter with this person, and after he said the agreement was for me to pay him. So the next thing I know, we end up having a fight, me and this Polish man.'

Barnes, a father-of-two, was seen in the area on the day of Mrs Beamond's death; he is later said to have been captured on CCTV pawning a television stolen from her house

According to Barnes' account, Mr Silverstone then entered the bedroom and became embroiled in a 'three-way fight' as the Polish man armed himself with a knife.

Barnes claimed that he saw the Polish man strike Mr Silverstone with a car jack, before he left the scene, 'I just didn't want to be part of what was going on'. 

The trial continues tomorrow.
