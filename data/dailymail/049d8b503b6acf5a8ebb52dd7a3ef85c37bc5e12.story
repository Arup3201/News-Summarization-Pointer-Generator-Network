Carl Frampton has branded Eddie Hearn's £1.5million offer to fight Scott Quigg as little more than a 'publicity stunt'.

Hearn made the offer live on television on Tuesday after talks between him and Frampton’s promoter Barry McGuigan had stalled.

But Belfast's IBF super-bantamweight world champion has called on the Matchroom chief to make him a more realistic offer.

'It’s the biggest publicity stunt I’ve seen since that incident between Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson at Superbowl XXXVIII (when Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Timberlake),' Frampton wrote in his News Letter column.

'[It] is undoubtedly a lot of money. But does that mean I should snap it up with both hands?

'Absolutely not, and there are a number of reasons why.

'It’s a flat rate offer, which means that no matter how well this fight does at the box office, this is the most I’ll receive.

'If pay-per-view targets are reached this fight can bring in £10million and potentially as much as £12m.

'So please, the next time you make an offer, make it a realistic one.'

Quigg showed off a £1.5m cheque ready to hand to Frampton on Sky Sports earlier this week

But Frampton has branded the gesture a 'publicity stunt' and ridiculed the offer

Hearn was quick to respond on Twitter, saying: '[The] fact is we are putting offers on the table and you aren't! If the offer is that bad then make us one?

'Also, if it makes as much money as you stated in your link, why have you also turned down 60-40 for the winner?'

Hearn has earmarked July 18 at the Manchester Arena for the world title unification clash with Nonito Donaire and Kiko Martinez alternative opponents for Quigg.
