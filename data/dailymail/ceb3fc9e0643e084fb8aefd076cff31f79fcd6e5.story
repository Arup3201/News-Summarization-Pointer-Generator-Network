It was reported that Mr Gaffney was knocked unconscious and taken to hospital

Mr Gaffney, 41, slipped backwards during his second attempt on the makeshift water slide.

'I was out for about 20 to 30 seconds … It was a bit of a whack but it was all right,' he told The Courier Mail.

After the accident he had to stay in hospital over the weekend as medical staff kept an eye on his head injuries.

But he remained unfazed by the accident and wants to see the tradition continue.

'Absolutely, the party should continue - it was just one minor accident that didn't have any serious consequences,' Mr Gaffney said.

Haydn Long, a Flight Centre spokesman, told The Courier Mail they've never experienced any injuries as serious as Mr Gaffney's in the past.

Earlier in the week, Instagram user Strong_nat took to the social media platform to share a snap and a video from the event.

She wrote: 'Yes this is a slip'n'slide in the office #flightcentre #flighties #slipnslide #bestworkplace #headoffice #lastdayofwork'.

Reddit user Travelator, first spread word of the Christmas tradition by taking to the online forum last week to share an image which gained more than 5,000 'upvotes' for the jealousy-inducing photograph.

'I work for a large multinational company headquartered in Brisbane and we do this every year,' the office worker, who preferred to remain anonymous and went by the title 'assistant to the regional slider', told Daily Mail Australia.

'The slide is about 60m long and it's a tradition that really brings everyone together just before Xmas.

'There are always some great costumes and tactics used, and this year's competition was won by our Australian GM (general manager)!'

A spokesperson for the company also told The Courier Mail that they had never intended to publicise their six-year-running tradition, and were surprised by its new found popularity.

'This company is a fantastic place to work and our work life is centred around having fun and enjoying what we do,' Travelator said.

'It's things like this that make you feel like you're being rewarded for a years' worth of hard work.

'It only lasts a couple of hours, but it's amazingly fun and everyone gets involved.'

They said the office workers always had new costumes and tactics, with this year's competition being won by the Australian general manager
