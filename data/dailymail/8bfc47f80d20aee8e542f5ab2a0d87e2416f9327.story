The WorldView-3 spacecraft (illustration pictured) identifies objects as small as 1 foot (31cm) from an orbit of 383 miles (617km) 

Orbiting above Earth is a satellite so powerful, it can identify the number of chickens, manhole covers and even parking spaces around the world.

DigitalGlobe's WorldView-3 spacecraft was launched into space from a military base in California on Wednesday - and is so high-resolution, it can pick out objects as small as 1 foot (31cm).

The 18ft-long (5.4 metres), 8ft-wide (2.4 metres) satellite should last for at least seven years, but experts claim the satellite could be functional for almost double that time. 

WorldView-3 is also designed to peer through fog and smoke to image Earth's surface in detail, using an on-board instrument called CAVIS - short for Cloud, Aerosol, water Vapor, Ice, Snow.

This will help the satellite get a sharp view of the ground even if there is a fire, dust clouds, soot and smog.

It is powered by solar panels, which extend the length and width of the satellite to 19ft long and 23ft wide (5.8 by 7 metres), and it weighs 6,200 lbs (2,812 kg).

It will orbit at a distance of around 383 miles (617 km) above Earth's surface, and take 97 minutes to make a single orbit.

WorldView-3 is one of five Earth-observation satellites being used by DigitalGlobe. 

The others include WorldView-2 Satellite Sensor, WorldView-1 Satellite Sensor and GeoEye-1 Satellite Sensor, which each have a resolution of 1.6ft (46cm).

Its QuickBird Satellite Sensor has a resolution of 2.1ft (65cm), and IKONOS Satellite Sensor can view objects at 2.6ft (82cm).

It will orbit at a distance of around 383 miles (617 km) above Earth's surface, and take 97 minutes to make a single orbit.

Elsewhere, the satellite can send 1.2 GB of data back to Earth every second.  

The satellite can even monitor how healthy trees are, said Kumar Navulur, DigitalGlobe's director of next-generation products.

‘We can tell you, for each individual tree, how healthy it is.’

‘And potentially there are models that can estimate the yield of each individual tree.

That's the power of information we are bringing to the table with WorldView-3.’

The commercial satellite was launched on board an Atlas 5 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base.

The $500million (£299 million) project is a collaboration between Colorado-based DigitalGlobe, and Boulder-based Ball Aerospace.

Lockheed Martin and the United Launch Alliance are also partners.

In June, DigitalGlobe was given permission from the US Department of Commerce to collect and sell imagery at the best available resolutions.

In June, DigitalGlobe was given permission by the US Department of Commerce to collect and sell imagery at the best available resolutions. Six months after WorldView-3 is operational, DigitalGlobe will be allowed to sell imagery at up to 10 inches (25cm). Japan's Fukushima plant is pictured, captured by WorldView-2

Additionally, six months after WorldView-3 is operational, DigitalGlobe will be permitted to sell imagery at up to 10 inches (25cm).

These include images for Nasa, the government and other national and security agencies.

Elsewhere, the satellite can send 1.2 GB of data back to Earth every second.

Remote thruster and instrument checks will be carried out over the next month, and a data-certification process will follow to make sure the images are clear enough.
