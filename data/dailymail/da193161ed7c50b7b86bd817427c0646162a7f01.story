No regrets: Francesco Schettino, captain of the ill-fated Costa Concordia cruise liner

The captain of the ill-fated Costa Concordia cruise liner has admitted he has no regrets about his actions in the aftermath of the shipwreck that left 32 people dead.

The holiday vessel Concordia 
slammed into rocks off the Italian island of Giglio last year after Captain Francesco Schettino took it off its 
pre-programmed course and brought it closer to land as a favour to 
friends from the island.

Schettino say he understands why some people 
'hate' him, but defended his actions and blamed others 
on the bridge for failing to inform him of the situation in time, and 
then of botching his orders once he tried to steer clear of the reef. 

Schettino who is accused of multiple manslaughter, causing the wreck and abandoning ship, said in an interview with NBC News he tried to make sure he was the last person to leave the ship.

'People don't understand that the ship 
is 58 meters (nearly 200 feet) wide, so you don't have a chance to see 
who else is left on the other side. 

'And in the moment the floor started
to become steeper, you have no other option: To die, or to swim,' he 
said.

'So, I regret nothing.'

Schettino, insisted that other people should share the blame for the accident and claimed that Costa Cruises told him before the wreck that he needed to share 
some authority with lower-ranking officers.

'Unfortunately I was relying, in the last three minutes, on an officer, 
when all of a sudden he was handing me the control of the ship without 
giving me distance -nothing,' Schettino said.

'I
regret that I was trusting (that officer).  I was trusting him before 
the accident, and also after the accident.  And I have been living with 
these things inside me.  I will never trust anyone anymore because this 
was a very deadly mistake,' he said.

As survivors  
and victims' families marked the one-year anniversary of the accident at the weekend Schettino did not attend the 
unveiling of memorials and remained at his home near 
Naples, where he lives under some court restrictions.

Anniversary: Silence is observed during a Catholic mass to commemorate the Costa Concordia disaster near the shipwreck on the island of Giglio, located off the coast of Tuscany, on Sunday night

In honour: The participants joined in a torchlight procession on Giglio Island close to the wreckage, and placed the torched to light up the commemorative plaque with the names of those who died in the disaster

But taking part in the anniversary 
commemoration was Captain Gregorio De Falco of the Italian coast guard, 
who became something of a hero to survivors after his recorded 
conversations with Schettino during the evacuation were made public.

In 
them, De Falco excoriated Schettino for having abandoned the ship before
all passengers were off and ordered him to return, shouting the 
now-infamous order "Go on board (expletive)!"

In an interview broadcast Sunday with RAI state television, Schettino  said he wanted to 'share in the pain of all the victims and the families of the victims.'

At the remembrance on Sunday a Catholic Mass was held in memory of the tragedy after which the islanders, passengers and relatives gathered observed a minute's silence at 9.45 - the time of the ship's collision with the rocks.

Some of the 3,200 surviving passengers, and relatives of the 32 who lost their lives, were taken by boat close to the wreck.

They watched as a crane lowered part of a rock that was removed from the hull of the 950 ft long ship into the water. The rock has been carved into a memorial and adorned with a plaque.

After a year we are still traumatised,’ said Violet Morreau, a survivor from France, who was in the restaurant area with 10 family members the ship hit the rocks before keeling over on its side off the Tuscan island.

‘No one told us what to do. We were scared of dying, like the people who did lose their lives, because of somebody else's recklessness,’ Morreau said.

Salvage crews are working on refloating the wreck in what would be the largest ever operation of its kind. U.S. firm Titan Salvage said on Saturday the ship would be removed by September at the latest.

The 114,500-tonne liner will be pulled upright by cranes, helped by tanks attached to its sides filled with air, and the ship will be towed to an Italian port and broken up.

The vessel's owner Costa Cruises, a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp, now expects the removal to cost £248 million, more than its original £186 million estimate.

A total of 3,229 passengers and 1,023 crew were on board the Costa Concordia when it sank. Whilst 30 bodies have been recovered, two people are still missing, presumed dead.
