Dieters can reduce cravings for fatty foods and snacks by playing Tetris, claim psychologists.

Scientists said just three minutes on the classic brain-teaser can reduce naturally occurring cravings long enough to stave them off.

It works by distracting the user’s brain so they don’t have time to visualise snacks, alcoholic drinks or cigarettes, according to researchers at Plymouth University.

Almost half of male gamers in a recent study admitted they have turned down sex to continue playing.

While a fifth of female gamers said they’d missed weddings and hen dos.

More disgustingly, one in seven gamers confessed to relieving themselves in an empty drinks bottle to avoid having to leave the room with gamers in Birmingham among the worst offenders.

The research was commissioned by Domino’s Pizza.

During tests, researchers asked a group of volunteers to rate their cravings in terms of strength, vividness and intrusiveness.

Half the participants were told to play Tetris for three minutes, but only half actually got to use the classic 1984 tile-matching game while the others half waited for it to boot up.

The individuals playing Tetris experienced 24 per cent weaker cravings than those waiting unsuccessfully for the game to load.

The research was conducted by PhD student Jessica Skorka-Brown, alongside Professors Jackie Andrade and Jon May, from the university’s Cognition Institute.

They say their findings could provide a 
quick and manageable fix for people struggling to stick to diets or 
trying to give up smoking or alcohol.

Professor Andrade said: 'Episodes of craving normally only last a few minutes, during which time an individual is visualising what they want and the reward it will bring.

'Often those feelings result in the person giving in and consuming the very thing they are trying to resist.

'But by playing Tetris, just in short bursts, you are preventing your brain creating those enticing images and without them the craving fades.'

More than 170 million copies of Tetris have been sold worldwide since it was invented by programmer Alexey Pajitnov in the Soviet Union.

It was developed for the home computers and arcades but became a global phenomenon after it was brought out for the hand-held Nintendo Gameboy in 1989.
