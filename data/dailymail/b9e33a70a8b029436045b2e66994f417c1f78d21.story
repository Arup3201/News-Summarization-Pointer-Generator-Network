Johnson seemed to be affected by the incident as he walked back to the mark but his skipper, after first checking with his opposite number, quickly ran to his fast bowler's side and offered words of encouragement.

The test match has been dedicated to late batsman Phillip Hughes, Australia's 13th man, who died two weeks ago today after being struck in the neck by a bouncer. 

The incident, just before lunch, is the first time a batsman has been struck in the head since the tragedy took place a fortnight ago at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

India went at 2 for 119 at the lunch break, in reply to Australia's overnight score of 7 for 517 declared.

Words of encouragement from the Aussie skipper Michael Clarke for paceman Mitchell Johnson, who was noticeably shaken up after his delivery struck the Indian captain on the helmet

Earlier, captain Clarke surprised most by taking the field after Australia's declaration.

The Australians called a halt to their first innings, leaving Smith unbeaten on 162, his highest Test score.

Rain and bad light restricted the second day to 30.4 overs, with Thursday's play starting half an hour earlier to make up some of the lost time.

Clarke, despite battling a chronic back injury which put him in hospital after day one made 128 after retiring hurt on the opening day.

The skipper didn't take part in Australia's warm-up drills ahead of the third day's play but took the field when play started

Clarke has shifted from his usual slot in slips, fielding instead at mid-off.
