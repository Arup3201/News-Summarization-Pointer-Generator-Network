A Nike salesman has been sacked from the company's flagship London store for trying to sell his own second hand, company-issue trainers online.

Daniel Jones, 23, posted a message on Facebook when his mother asked him to clear out his bedroom wardrobe, advertising five pairs of Nike shoes.

He had accumulated the trainers during three-and-a-half years working at Nike's Oxford Street store.

Sacked: Salesman Daniel Jones lost his job at Niketown for trying to sell five of his own trainers on Facebook

Mr Jones had bought two of the pairs himself at full price and two at a discount and had been given the fifth pair for free.

He said would have accepted around £200 for all five and insisted he was only trying to earn a bit of money and not deliberately cash in on his job.

But within days of his message appearing on his Facebook page he was hauled in by bosses and accused of gross misconduct.

Mr Jones was suspended on the spot from his part-time £8,000-a-year job and sent home to Essex to await his fate. He then got a letter from the company telling him he had been sacked.

He said: 'All I was doing was clearing out my wardrobe because my parents were going on about it.

'I thought I'll just stick the trainers on Facebook along with a lot of other clutter to see if anyone of my close friend wanted to buy them.

'Most of them are several years' old but Nike accused me of trying to make a profit out of their business.

'They told me I wasn't allowed to advertise their stuff but I was only having a clear-out like anyone else.'

Mr Jones was granted an appeal hearing against his sacking but Nike refused to change their mind.

He added: 'They told me it didn't matter if I'd made a penny or a thousand pounds out of the sale - it was still a breach of company policy.

'I cooperated with them and removed all existence of my posts to friends on Facebook as soon as I was made aware of my mistake, but yet they still sacked me.

Misconduct: The 23-year-old was hauled in by his bosses within days of the shoes appearing on Facebook

Second hand: Two pairs of the trainers Mr Jones was trying to sell were bought at full price

'The fact I still had the intention to sell means I breached their rule book. The whole nonsense has been so distressing, I've had trouble sleeping.

'It wasn't premeditated and I was one of their best salesmen with an exemplary record, yet I'm kicked out without any warning.'

He has now contacted a solicitor and ACAS and is considering further action for unfair dismissal.

A Nike spokesman said: 'This employee was dismissed from Niketown London on the grounds of gross misconduct.

'The
Nike Employee Handbook states that the re-selling of discounted Nike 
goods by employees at a profit is considered gross misconduct.

'All
Nike UK employees are required to read the handbook and sign a 
declaration that they have read it and he stated that he had read it and
also signed the declaration form.'
