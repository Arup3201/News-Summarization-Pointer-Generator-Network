The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning doctors to be on the lookout for an untreatable multidrug-resistant 'superbug' emerging in the U.S.

The 'superbug' springs from a bacteria called Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacea, 15 types of which have been seen in the U.S. in the last year. The unique bacteria can cause pneumonia, intestinal and urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.

In one outbreak at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, seven deaths were attributed to the 'superbug' after a New York Woman who came to the hospital for a lung transplant while infected.

Drug resistant: CRE's may live in the intestines and lungs and may cause pneumonia, meningitis, and other diseases

The victims included one 16-year-old boy.

Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, are bacteria that are unique in that they are resistant to most antibiotics. They typically live in the soil or water. Patients infected with the bacteria are typically not symptomatic, but can develop pneumonia, kidney and bladder infections, and bloodstream infectioins. They began appearing in the U.S. roughly ten years ago, and have since spread to at least 41 states. There is no effective treatment yet available for the bacteria, which can linger in the body more than a year, and mortality rates hover at 40 to 50 per cent.

The infections are associated with mortality rates of 40 to 50 per cent.

The rise means health care providers must 'act aggressively to prevent the emergence and spread of these unusual 
CRE organisms,' the CDC said.

'From the perspective of drug-resistant 
organisms, (CRE) is the most serious threat, the most serious challenge 
we face to patient safety,' Arjun Srinivasan, associate director 
for prevention of health care-associated infections at the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, told USA Today.

It can take over a year to be rid of CRE bacteria, with one study determining the average patient requiring 387 days for it to be out of their system.

'We're working with state health departments to try to figure out how 
big a problem this is,' Srinivasan said, noting that his 
agency can pool whatever incidence data states collect. 'We're still at a
point where we can stop this thing. You can never eradicate CRE, but we
can prevent the spread. ... It's a matter of summoning the will.'

Enterobacteriaceae flourish in the soil, water, and the human gut.

A 'superbug,' CRE has a high level of resistance to antibiotics.

Sterile: The CDC is recommending that any doctors who treat patients with a superbug be tested themselves and refrain from treating patients not infected

Disturbingly, the patients are not 
symptomatic, as the bug waits in the body until the immune system is 
compromised and an infection sets in.

The first known U.S. case was 
detected at a North Carolina hospital in 2001, and since then CRE's have
been detected in at least 41 other states.

Many cases still go unrecognized until its too late for the patient.

Since the first known case, at a 
North Carolina hospital, was reported in 2001, CREs have spread to at 
least 41 other states, according to the CDC. And many cases still go 
unrecognized, because it can be tough to do the proper laboratory 
analysis, particularly at smaller hospitals or nursing homes.

People diagnosed with a CRE infection
usually get it after taking antibiotics and undergoing significant 
medical treatment for other conditions.

Also in the news last summer was an outbreak of CRE in eight patients - the largest outbreak in the U.S. so far.

None of the patients in the initial outbreak died.

Resistant: CRE's are resistant to treatment and doctors must be aggressive in watching for the infections

The hospital was able to detect the outbreak early largely due to stringent surveillance protocols.

The CDC said most CRE cases were 'isolated from patients who received 
overnight medical treatment outside of the United States.'

There are CDC guidelines to deal with the infection in the center's 2012 CRE toolkit.

If you share a room with a person with a CRE infection you should be screened immediately.

Health care providers who treat infected patients should also be examined. They should not treat non-infected patients after treating infected ones.

Health care facilities must also be made aware of any CRE infected patients being transferred to their care.
