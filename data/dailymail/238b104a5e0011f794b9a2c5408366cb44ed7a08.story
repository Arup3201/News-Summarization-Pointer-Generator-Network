The National Zoo's giant panda cub has been given a clean bill of health after its first full veterinary exam.

Veterinarians performed a 20-minute examination late on Monday afternoon at the Washington D.C. zoo when the panda cub's mother Mei Xiang (pronounced 'May Shong') provided an opportunity for baby bear to be checked.

Mei Xiang put the female cub down and left the den for a short time to eat bamboo and drink water.

The National Zoo's tiny panda cub has been given a clean bill of health after its first full health check. Vets at the Washington D.C. zoo performed a 20-minute exam on the as yet unnamed cub

The cub, born on August 23, is already showing her coloration with black patches around her ears, eyes and back.

'It’s amazing to see how much she has grown in less than one month,' said Brandie Smith, the zoo's senior curator of mammals and giant pandas.

'Mei Xiang continues to be a great mom, as she was with first daughter Tai Shan (pronounced 'Tie-Shon'), and it shows.'

The cub's parents, mother Mei Xiang and father Tian Tian (pronounced 'T-Yen T-Yen'), are the National Zoo's second pair of adult giant pandas.

The National Zoo's recent arrival was born on August 23 and is already showing her coloration with black patches around her ears, eyes and back.

Both were born at the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province and arrived in Washington D.C. in 2000.

Tian Tian, 16 years old, weighs in at a giant 275-pound while 15-year-old mother Mei Xiang is a comparatively sprightly 233 pounds.

The cub now weighs slightly less than two pounds, more than double her 4.8 ounce birth weight taken from a short exam on August 25. 

From nose to tail, the cub is 10.6 inches long. Her eyes have not yet opened.

Mei Xiang has spent much of the past three and a half weeks cradling her cub but last put her down and left her den at 4:11pm on Monday.

The panda team, which has been preparing for an opportunity to perform a full veterinary exam, seized the opportunity and retrieved the cub from the den while Mei Xiang ate bamboo and drank some water in the adjacent enclosure.

The exam was completed by 4.31pm.

The National Zoo's baby panda now weighs slightly less than two pounds, more than double her weight from a short exam on August 25. From nose to tail, the cub is 10.6 inches long.

Since her preliminary health check on August 25 the cub now also carries the signature black markings of a giant panda.

Veterinarians also listened to her heart and lungs and reported her heart rate was 130 beats per minute and respiratory rate was 42.

A twin cub was also stillborn repeating a similarly traumatic experience that occurred last year for Mei Xiang.

After several years of failed 
pregnancies, Mei Xiang gave birth to a cub last September that died less
than a week old from complications related to its lungs. It was 
reported that the tragic cub's lungs had not developed and were not 
sending enough oxygen to its liver.

The panda couple's first surviving cub, a male named Tai Shan, was born in 2005.

After Monday's exam on the latest addition top the family was completed Mei Xiang returned to her den and immediately picked up her cub and began grooming her.

Tradition dictates baby pandas are named when they are 100 days old.

The National Zoo's panda enclosure will be closed to the public until the cub is approximately four months old.
