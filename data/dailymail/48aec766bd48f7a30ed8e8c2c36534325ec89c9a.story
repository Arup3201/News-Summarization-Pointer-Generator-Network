Dilemma: Sir Chris Woodhead has got motor neurone disease

Sir Chris Woodhead, the former head of Ofsted, says he would now consider going to the Dignitas clinic to kill himself after watching a controversial BBC documentary.

He was diagnosed with motor neurone disease five years ago and now, at 64, he can no longer walk or move his arms.

Sir Chris, who took on the Left-wing establishment during his six years in charge of the education watchdog, had previously ruled out travelling to an assisted suicide clinic.

Two years ago he said: ‘I would be more likely to drive myself off a cliff in Cornwall than go to Dignitas and speak to a bearded social worker.’

But he admitted in a new interview that the BBC2 programme, Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die, had changed his mind. The documentary, broadcast in June, showed the death of millionaire Peter Smedley at the Swiss clinic.

Mr Smedley, 71, also a motor neurone disease (MND) sufferer, gave writer Sir Terry and the TV crew permission to film him drinking poison at Dignitas with his wife Christine, 60, at his side.

He was seen choking and gasping for water after he swallowed the barbiturate-based drink.

Sir Chris said: ‘It was very dignified. His wife was there and they sat on the sofa together. It was 30 seconds or so, and he was coughing a bit and he looked in some discomfort, but I thought it wasn’t a bad way to go.’

Sir Chris indicated that his views have been shaped by his parents’ deaths.

He suspects his father may have had undiagnosed MND, which destroys brain cells and leads to paralysis and possible suffocation.

Referring to his parents, Sir Chris said: ‘The last five years of their lives, increasingly they felt, “Why can’t we be allowed to die? Why can’t we just hold hands together and go?” They became increasingly irascible as they became increasingly desperate about their plight.

‘Their experience, and my experience watching them, and my  experience now, makes me feel  that there are no persuasive arguments against.’

Sir Chris said his dilemma is that if he waits too long, he may no longer be capable of swallowing the liquid drugs used by the clinic.

He said: ‘It’s an issue for me, an incredibly difficult issue, as to what point you decide you’ve had enough and you kill yourself.

'[The Government] decided their could be a badger cull... maybe they could agree on a cull of the terminally ill'

‘The decision cannot be entirely your own: Christine, my wife, Tamsin, my daughter, maybe even my granddaughter, the oldest one – they’ve all got views.

‘If it weren’t for them I might already have said I’d had enough.’

Sir Chris, who once claimed there were 15,000 incompetent teachers in the education system, believes it is an outrage that terminally ill patients have to travel abroad to end their lives in a way of their choosing.

He added: ‘The thing that worries me about assisted dying is I don’t think our politicians are ever going to have the b***s.

‘Maybe I’m wrong. They’ve decided that there could be a badger cull; maybe they could agree, too, that there should be a cull of the terminally ill!’

Almost 900 viewers made formal complaints to the BBC about the programme by Sir Terry, who has Alzheimer’s, while others took to internet sites to accuse the corporation of ‘romanticising’ and ‘normalising’ assisted death.

Controversial: More than 150 Britons have ended their lives at the Dignitas clinic in Zurich (pictured) over the past eight years

The charity, Care Not Killing, warned that the documentary  posed a ‘significant risk’ to vulnerable people and said copycat suicides were ‘highly likely’.

More than 150 Britons have ended their lives at the Dignitas clinic in Zurich over the past eight years, taking advantage of Swiss laws that allow assisted suicide.

This has opened up cracks in British law, under which helping someone to commit suicide is a crime carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years in jail.

It is usually impossible for someone who is seriously ill to travel to die without help from family or friends.

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, drew up guidelines suggesting that those who help a death will not be prosecuted it they act out of compassion and do not stand to gain from it.

No one has been prosecuted over a Dignitas death, even though Mr Starmer has been given nearly 40 cases to consider since his guidelines were published.
