Wimbledon is where Boris Becker will earn his money. Novak Djokovic appointed Boris as his coach last December and how good a signing he has been remains to be seen.

But I believe Boris was recruited with Wimbledon in mind. Novak will not want to lose to Andy Murray again, like he did in last year’s final. He looked like a deer in the headlights at times during that match, as if he was bewildered by the ferocity of the crowd support for Andy.

Surely he knew what it would be like! I’m not saying he would’ve won it, but if Boris had been with him the night before you would’ve certainly seen a different, more prepared Novak out there.

Novak has won only one of the last nine Grand Slams so doubts will be beginning to creep in, even if he would never admit it.

But if anyone can help him at Wimbledon, it’s Boris. When they walk through the gates together on Monday, Boris’s chest will be puffed out and his feathers fluffed. He won it three times, he was the king here and Novak will want some of Boris’s magic to rub off on him.

This is what he was brought to the party for and that’s why I fancy Novak for the title, narrowly over Andy — I definitely think the winner will come from their semi-final. 

The big four are so closely matched and so good that they are constantly seeking out that microscopic edge. That’s what Andy is looking for in Amelie Mauresmo. It is certainly an interesting appointment.

I don’t think she’s been brought in to change tactics, more to have someone there to listen and know what to say and what advice to impart the night before a biggie.

Even the greats have doubts before semis or finals. I remember seeing that with my ex-wife Chris Evert.

She had beaten her great rival Martina Navratilova in three sets in a late night semi-final at Wimbledon despite being a 20-1 underdog. She did all her off court media and we got back to our house in Kingston and the phone was ringing off the hook. She was ecstatic and spoke to everyone.

I said: 
‘Great but in 24 hours you’re on for the final.’ Sure enough, the next 
morning she was completely flat. If Billie Jean King had been there she 
would have seen the signs and pulled her into line. As it was, Chris 
lost to Evonne Goolagong Cawley.

New approach: Andy Murray has turned to Amelie Mauresmo after parting with Ivan Lendl 

Patience: Amelie Mauresmo will need time to help Andy Murray improve his game

One thing I detest on the women’s tour is the shrieking during games. It’s horrendous, absolutely awful and this was a product of people coaching it into them while they were young and now they can’t get out of it.

You just don’t need to make those noises when you’re hitting the ball. It’s  off-putting for spectators, it’s off-putting for the opponent and I’m so glad the WTA are doing something about it. They can’t stop it for this generation but for the next it will be stopped.

How they’re going to do it will be interesting, maybe they’ll have a gruntometer. But it has to be stopped. I’ve heard some of them practising and they don’t do it as loud then.

After Lendl, I don’t think Murray could have been with anyone who wasn’t a Grand Slam winner. He has a lot of trust and respect for his best friend and hitting partner Dani Vallverdu but emotionally, Dani can’t tell him how he should feel the night before a Wimbledon final, whereas Amelie can.

The only issue that could arise during rain delays is that women are not allowed in the men’s locker rooms. They’re both members at Wimbledon so should be able to find a room but it could be a problem at the US Open. I don’t think it would be a problem if women were allowed in the locker room anyway. Who gives a damn really? There are female physios in football teams who are allowed in the changing rooms.

I also hope Amelie is given time. She’s only been there three weeks and he’s already failed to defend his Queen’s title so in effect she’s one down one to go. It can take a few months for a new coach to take effect so I hope she’s not seen as a failure if Murray doesn’t win Wimbledon. I listened to lay people questioning why he would appoint Amelie and there are still those sexist attitudes. If it doesn’t go well there’ll be a lot of people saying: ‘I told you so.’
