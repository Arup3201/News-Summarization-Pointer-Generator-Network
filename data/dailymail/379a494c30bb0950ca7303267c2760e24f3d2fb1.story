The nurse cleared of poisoning patients vowed to clear her name yesterday as she left home for the first time since her release from prison.

Rebecca Leighton, who has changed her dyed red hair to black, spent more than six weeks in custody after a number of elderly patients died from suspected saline drip contamination.

She was released on Friday when all charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.

Her lawyer said the case against her became untenable when police realised that a saline bag bearing her fingerprints had not been tampered with.

Solicitor Carl Richmond claimed 27-year-old Miss Leighton had been made a scapegoat by police who felt under pressure to end the ‘chaos’ surrounding the case and that she was determined to clear her name.

Since her release, she has remained at the family home in Denton, Greater Manchester, with her parents Linda and David, and fiancé Tim Papworth, 28.

She is still suspended from working as a nurse after she was accused of contaminating saline fluids with insulin at Stepping Hill Hospital, in Stockport, Cheshire.

Mr Richmond said she would ask the Nursing and Midwifery Council to overturn the suspension.

compensation worth up to £1million

He said: ‘She wants the opportunity 
to have her suspension lifted and then she will make the decision what 
to do next.

She has worked as a nurse for a long time so that’s 
obviously in her thoughts but she’s still a bit raw.

‘She wants to clear her name professionally and that’s her priority at the moment.’

Asked whether she would return to 
work at Stepping Hill, Mr Richmond said: ‘I don’t know. It might be too 
difficult. The finger of suspicion was firmly pointed at her and you 
don’t recover from that quickly.

‘She needs to clear her head and 
decide what’s best for her in the long term. She has gone away with her 
family to consider this.

‘She feels dreadfully sorry for the families of the victims.’

Police are investigating the deaths 
of seven patients connected with sabotaged saline drips.

Officers 
believe another 33 may also have been potential victims of 
contamination, but survived.

Claiming that Miss Leighton had been 
made a scapegoat, her solicitor said: ‘There was absolute chaos at the 
hospital and it could not function because of all the speculation.

‘I was imploring the police to bail her while they continued their inquiries but the decision was made to charge.’

Instead of pursuing the normal course
of granting Miss Leighton bail while inquiries continued, officers 
decided to arrest her on suspicion of murder and then charge her with 
causing criminal damage with intent to endanger life at Stepping Hill 
Hospital.

Miss Leighton could now sue police for a six-figure sum for wrongful arrest or compensation for her prison ordeal.

Police are continuing to investigate 
the deaths of Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, Derek Weaver, 83, 
and four more potential victims.

The Chief Constable of Greater 
Manchester Police, Peter Fahy, defended the force’s actions, saying the 
case was ‘incredibly complex’.

He told the BBC: ‘We’ve got a 
hospital where 4,000 people work and just in the area we’re looking at 
we think there are more than 700 people involved.’
