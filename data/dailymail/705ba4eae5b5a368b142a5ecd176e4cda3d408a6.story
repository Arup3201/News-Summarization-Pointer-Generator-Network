Disgraced peer Conrad Black branded a television presenter a 'jackass' yesterday in a terse clash over the former media mogul’s criminal past.

The unrepentant convict criticised Sky’s Adam Boulton for his 'predictable questions' and accused the political editor of not knowing 'what he was talking about'.

It came after a fractious interview on BBC2’s Newsnight on Monday night, which saw Black tell Jeremy Paxman he was proud he had endured their tense exchange without 'getting up and smashing your face in'.

Belligerent: Conrad Black answers the 'predictable' questions by Sky's Adam Boulton - who inadvertently uses his middle finger as a gesture while he questions him

Not amused: Black is defiant about his convictions, and has attacked interviewers who have questioned him about his criminal past

His belligerent displays promise a fiery appearance on Friday night's Have I Got News For You quiz show, which will see him tackling panellists Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, renowned for their scathing views on well-known figures.

Black, former proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, has arrived in the UK to promote his new book A Matter Of Principle,but is clearly in no mood to to answer any uncomfortable questions.

He has taken the approach of denying that he was ever in the wrong and shouting at anyone who suggests he is a criminal.

Defiant Black, who was imprisoned for three years for defrauding investors, insisted he had nothing to be ashamed of and indicated his potential plans to retake his seat in the House of Lords.

Asked by Mr Boulton where he would live now he had been 'kicked out' of the United States, Black said: 'Stop being a jackass. You are just being abrasive. No, you don’t know what you are talking about.'

Black said he was only tolerating the interview to publicise his unflinching memoir that describes his nine-year battle with the US justice system.

He added: 'I’m selling books. That’s why I am here. I’m not here to enjoy your somewhat predictable questions.'

It is his memoir that has brought him to the UK and the studios of Have I Got News For You, Newsnight and Sky News, a decision that has sparked amusement and amazement in equal measure.

If there is one thing the panellists on the Have I got News For You show like more than taking potshots at a pillar of the establishment, then it is demolishing a fallen pillar of the establishment – yet Lord Black, 68, couldn’t care less.

Mr Boulton suggested Black would end up 
as a 'figure of fun' when he appears on the BBC’s Have I Got News For 
You later this week, but was told: 'We’ll see who makes whom a figure of
fun. I normally don’t mind exchanging acerbities if that’s what people 
want to do.'

Black, whose empire once included the 
Chicago Sun-Times, The Jerusalem Post and
small papers across the U.S. and Canada, returned to prison last 
September to finish serving his sentence, and was released in May.

On Monday night Black, who was released from a US jail earlier this year, accused Paxman of being a 'priggish, gullible, British fool' for taking seriously the 'ghastly' American justice system.

'Let me tell you something, I am proud of having gone through the terribly difficult process of being falsely charged, falsely convicted and ultimately almost completely vindicated without losing my mind, becoming irrational, ceasing to be a penitent and reasonable person and actually being able to endure a discussion like this without getting up and smashing your face in, which is what most people would do if they had been through what I had been.'

Coming out fighting: Conrad Black insists he is not a criminal and made no 'ethical mistakes'

Paxman said: 'Well, you go ahead.'

'No, I don’t believe in violence,' Black replied.

Asked if he expected to retain his seat in the House of Lords he said: 'Well, why not? First of all there is not a prohibition on a convicted criminal sitting in that House.'

He told Paxman he had been 'persecuted half to death', before announcing: 'I don't have any shame' when questioned about his conviction, reiterating: 'I am not a criminal.'

He insisted he was innocent, saying the accusations are 'rubbish, and anyone can see they are rubbish. I'm not a convicted fraudster.'

However, he did concede to a bemused-looking Paxman that he had been too easy-going before his disgrace.

He said: 'I will agree that I probably became a bit insouciant and, to that extent, my downfall was justified.'

But he also insisted he was not a criminal and had a morally clean record: ' I have made a lot of mistake, but not ethical ones.'

As his tense interview with Jeremy Paxman continued, he also complained that he was 'going to throw up' when Paxman quizzed him about Black's wife, journalist Barbara Amiel, and asked if she was extravagant with money.

He said: 'After seven years away, my first morning back in Britain and I have to be subjected to this? She's a magnificent wife.'

Black, who owned a number of other world newspapers, was raised to the peerage as Baron Black of Crossharbour in 2001.

Black showed that he was in no mood to tolerate any uncomfortable questions Paxman threw at him in the Newsnight interview.

His most belligerent lines included him telling Paxman that he was a priggish, gullible, British fool.'

He also told him that Paxman's grasp of the American judicial system was lacking: 'Your problem is that you have no idea how that system operates.'

He demanded that Paxman stop being so 'bourgeois' with his questions, and told him that he was 'not a criminal.'

He branded the bemused interviewer a 'priggish, gullible fool' for daring to suggest that convicted Black was a criminal.

Clearly feeling fired up after his appearance on Newsnight, an exasperated-looking Black was interviewed by Adam Boulton on Sky News.

The disgraced former media tycoon said he was only tolerating Boulton's 'somewhat predictable questions' because he is promoting his memoir.

In another stinging swipe, Black carelessly asked Boulton his name again, as he had forgotten it earlier.

He also told the political editor that he had 'no idea what he was talking about'.

As a leaving remark, he assured Boulton, who questioned him about his appearance on HIGNFU, that he could defend himself against the notoriously acerbic wit of the pannelists.

It started in 2003 when shareholders accused Black of skimming off millions of dollars from his global newspaper empire between 1999 and 2001.

He was charged, alongside his associates at Hollinger holding company, and eventually convicted of stealing $6.1 million.

They were accused of amassing the cash by handing themselves tax-free bonuses, from the selling off of their newspapers, without the consent of the firm's board.

Black was sentenced, in 2007, to six and a half years (78 months) in prison.

But, after he had served 29 months, the US Supreme Court dissolved the 'honest services' law that had formed the basis of his conviction.

He was released in 2010 so that his case could be re-examined, and he succeeded in overturning two of his four initial convictions.

It meant that he was responsible for de-frauding significantly less money than for what he was first convicted.

The majority of his sentence pertained to an obstruction of justice - where he is said to have removed 13 boxes from his Toronto office while under investigation.

Last June he was re-sentenced and was sent back to prison with 13 months left to serve. He was released five months in May early for good behaviour.
