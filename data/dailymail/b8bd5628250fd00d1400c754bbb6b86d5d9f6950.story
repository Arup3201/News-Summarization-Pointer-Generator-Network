Britain’s smallest million-pound house has gone on the market - a studio flat that is more than five times the country’s average property price.

The refurbished £950,000 home in Mayfair, central London, is made up of a joint living and sleeping area with a small kitchenette and shower room.

Agents have described it as a fine example of a purpose-built Mayfair ‘dower flat’ - a property once used by genteel widows in the Victorian and Edwardian era and used by the landed gentry of the real Downton Abbey. 

Tiny: The refurbished £950,000 home in Mayfair, central London, is made up of a joint living and sleeping area with a small kitchenette and shower room

Bathroom and kitchen: The property - billed by estate agents as 'Mayfair’s biggest bargain' - is spread across just 328 sq ft, making it a third of the size of a UK new build

Costly venture: The owner will also have to pay a further £38,000 in stamp duty and then stump up a £2,200-a-year service charge

Mayfair dower flats were deliberately compact to keep maintenance and cost to a minimum.

The Dowager Countess of Carnarvon (the real Downton Abbey), the Dowager Countess of Portsmouth, Dowager Lady Deere and the Dowager Countess of Stafford all had Mayfair flats.

It is thought that during the late 1920s, Lady Virginia Champneys, widow of Sir Francis Champneys, lived in a flat at the address where this property is located.

However, it is more likely this studio flat will be lived in by a super-rich foreign student or used as a pied-a-terre. 

From the outside: The flat is more than £750,000 above the average UK house price of £188,374, and is sold with a 100-year-lease

History: The flat is also a good example of a purpose-built Mayfair 'dower flat' - a property once used by genteel widows in the Victorian and Edwardian era

Expected occupants: It is  likely this studio flat will be lived in by a super-rich foreign student or used as a pied-a-terre

The total floor space is no bigger than a bathroom suite in some upmarket hotels

The property - billed by estate agents as ‘Mayfair’s biggest bargain’ - is spread across just 328 sq ft, making it a third of the size of a UK new build.

The owner will also have to pay a further £38,000 in stamp duty and then stump up a £2,200-a-year service charge.

And the flat, which is more than £750,000 above the average UK house price of £188,374, is sold with a 100-year-lease.

The total price paid will therefore work out at around £1,020 per month, compared to a rent of £2,500 per month for a typical studio flat in Mayfair.

The flat has a living and entertaining area with wooden floors, ceiling spotlighting and room for a double bed.

There is also a walk-in shower and a fully fitted kitchen. The total floor space is no bigger than a bathroom suite in some upmarket hotels.

Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: ‘Compact yet chic, this purpose built Mayfair studio would historically have served as a dower flat for an aristocratic lady from the “Downton Abbey” era.

‘Now fully modernised it would provide the perfect Mayfair pad for an overseas student studying in London from a wealthy family or a socialite who wants a Mayfair address but at a lower cost.’
