A socialite has been charged with defrauding millions of dollars from the trust fund of a 92-year-old close friend who suffers from dementia.

Nancy Tsai, 66, a former darling of the Toronto charity circuit where she was known as a 'Glitter Girl', was arrested last week in Florida for allegedly scamming money from Helga Marston, who has been her friend for 40 years.

Tsai, the ex-wife of the late billionaire investor Gerald Tsai, is accused of using her ailing friend's riches to buy a $2.3million beachfront penthouse condo, a $170,000 Bentley, a $28,000 private jet day-trip from Florida to Canada and a $7,000 dinner at Cafe L'Europe in Palm Beach.

Tsai, the founder of the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation, was Martson's trustee and had power of attorney. Tsai's daughter E. Sarah Paul was the beneficiary of Marstonâ€™s most recent will.

Tsai was pictured in 2009 with Ms Martson at a lavish charity ball in Palm Beach, Florida, according to the New York Social Diary.

Police told the New York Post that Tsai was having an affair with Dennis Melchior who was the broker of the trust until he lost his job at UBS last year. 

Melchior denied any wrongdoing and said that Ms Marston, who has 'zero mental capacity' and lives in a nursing home, benefited from the money being spent.

Tsai was arrested on April 22 at her beachfront home. After nine hours in custody, she was released on $30,000 bond.

Ms Tsai rose to prominence in the 1980s when she was part of a group of women in Toronto who threw over-the-top charity fundraisers using their husbands' extreme wealth.

According to one Canadian social columnist, fashion designer Valentino even attended a lavish party at Nancy's home in 1986.

Nancy Paul met her first husband, real estate mogul Vincent Paul, when she was an air hostess on Air Canada in 1966. Mr Paul died in 1996.

She then went on to marry billionaire investor Gerald Tsai but the couple divorced in 2006. Mr Tsai died two years later.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Tsai's attorney.
