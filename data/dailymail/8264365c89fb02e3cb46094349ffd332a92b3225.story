Operation: Tracey Connelly is desperate for a gastric band operation so she can lose weight and find a new man now she's out of prison

Baby P's mother Tracey Connelly wants a gastric band to help her lose weight after ballooning to 22 stone while in prison, it has been claimed. 

Connelly told residents at her bail hostel she wanted to undergo the taxpayer-funded NHS procedure to help her find a new partner.

She was jailed in 2009 after the brutal death of her tortured son Peter, but was released in November following a Parole Board review.

The 32-year-old told friends at the halfway house where she has been living: 'I need to do something about my weight. No one will touch me looking like this,' the Mirror said.

As well as the operation which costs the NHS between £5,000 and £7,000, Connelly said she wanted diet pills to help her lose weight.

Though she will not receive a new identity, officials are to give her a new surname and hairstyle to help disguise her appearance.

She is also set to receive taxpayer-funded childcare lessons.

A source at the hostel in North England said: 'She is desperate to lose weight but wants a quick fix, slimming pills and a gastric band on the NHS.

'She talks about getting herself a fella all the time.'

Body mass index are among the factors which will be considered in order to qualify for the controversial operation.

NHS guidelines state patients must have tried all other ways to lose weight themselves and be seriously obese before being eligible to undergo the procedure.

Connelly, who weighs 22 stone, is due to stay at the hostel for several weeks until she is given a new home and job. She was released from prison several weeks ago.

She reportedly spends most of her time in her room, only leaving the premises to buy sweets and chocolate mousse at a nearby store.

Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after her 17-month-old son Peter was tortured to death by her boyfriend and his paedophile brother

The 32-year-old was recently spotted 
shopping in an Aldi supermarket near the hostel where onlookers saw her 
checking out bargains on festive food.

Gastric bands reduce the capacity of the stomach so recipients can only eat small meals.

Patients must have a body mass index of over 40 or 35 and suffer a medical condition to be eligible to receive the procedure which can cost up to £10,000.

Almost 1,500 people received gastric bands between 2011-2012, costing the NHS an estimated £85million.

Witnesses said the criminal seemed to be 'really enjoying herself' as she strolled the shop with a friend.

Earlier
 this month it was revealed the woman is also receiving childcare 
lessons at the hostel, as well as being taught literacy, numeracy and 
healthy living skills.

Connelly
 admitted causing or allowing the death of her 17-month-old son, Peter, 
in 2009, having done nothing to stop her boyfriend and his paedophile 
brother from torturing the infant to death.

The child's body was discovered at his mother's old flat in Tottenham, North London, in 2007.

Coroners found he had suffered 50 separate injuries, including a broken back.

While Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen remain behind bars, Connelly was released from County Durham's Low Newton jail at the end of October.

Probation officers ruled though the woman was still a danger to children, she is no longer a danger to the public.
