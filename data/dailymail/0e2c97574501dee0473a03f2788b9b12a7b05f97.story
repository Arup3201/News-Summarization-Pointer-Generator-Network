Forget vivid shades and garish colours, the latest eyeshadow craze is to go nude — earthy and pink tones that mimic the natural colour of our eyelids.

They make eyes look bigger and flatter older skin as they don’t crease or highlight wrinkles. The Duchess of Cambridge is a fan — last week she revealed her favourite eye make-up is Urban Decay’s Naked Palette.

Here, Alice Smellie puts the latest nude eyeshadows to the test ...

KATE’S MAKE-UP

Naked Palette, Urban Decay, £38, urbandecay.co.uk

SHADES OF NUDE: Twelve rich shades from deep cream to charcoal are presented in a fabric case with a mirror. They are applied with a double-ended, scarily large brush.

APPLICATION: The cream looks startlingly white on my eyelids, but the bronze shades are easy to blend. Though thick, both ends of the brush are delicate enough to apply to my lids without dropping product onto my face. The thinner of the two ends draws a thick, dark line above and below my lashes. I look in the mirror and my eyes are smoky enough to hang out in a jazz club, but not overly gothic, and it lasts through a dog walk with a sprinkling of sleet, which is impressive. 9/10

METALLIC MAGIC

La Palette Nude Rose, L’Oreal, £14.99, boots.com

SHADES OF NUDE: A slender compact with ten shades, from beige through rosy tints to a dark purple. Six have a subtle metallic sparkle.

APPLICATION: You can’t go wrong with these! The shades are sheer so you don’t need a steady hand to apply it and can layer them on confidently.

The darker shades look menacingly gloomy in the compact, yet they are so sheer on the skin that I end up using a dark brown rather than a bronze. The final look is age-appropriate for me in my early 40s, and it is light enough to wear in the day.

When I catch sight of myself in changing room mirrors while out shopping, I look ten times less tired than usual. 8/10

NEUTRAL TONES

Mini Eye Palette, No 7, £11, boots.com

SHADES OF NUDE: Eight Farrow & Ball-style shades: a deep cream, four similar-looking browns and three shades of grey. Application is via a double-ended brush.

APPLICATION: The lightest shade looks mask-white on my eyelid. A lot of powder comes away as I swirl the brush over the eyeshadow. I find the brush too thick to apply a line along my lashes and it gives me a bruised look under the eyes. The result is messy. 4/10

EYESHADOW PRO

Full Exposure Palette, Smashbox, £37, smashbox.co.uk

SHADES OF NUDE: There are 14 daunting looking colours with a double-ended blending brush.

APPLICATION: I am amazed at how easily the brush swoops over my eyelids. I play around with three shades of bronze. But then I get over-confident: I attempt to draw a line with the charcoal and end up looking as though I’ve been up a chimney. 6/10

PORTABLE TOUCH-UP

Eyes Uncovered Nude Palette, Collection, £3.99, superdrug.com

SHADES OF NUDE: The budget option: the case is cardboard with no mirror. The applicator is double-ended, but consists of just two flimsy- feeling foam pads. There are six matte colours, ranging from nude to charcoal.

APPLICATION: As I smear the brush around the powder, I gouge a chunk out of the charcoal. The powder sinks into my wrinkles. It looks as though my six-year-old applied my make-up. Not for me. 3/10
