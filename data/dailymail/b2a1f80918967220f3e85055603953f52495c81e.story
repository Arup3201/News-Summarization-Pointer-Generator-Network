A cannabis-smoking supporter of hate preacher Anjem Choudary has walked free from court after grooming a 15-year-old schoolgirl on Facebook.

Mansoor Miah sent explicit photographs to the schoolgirl before inviting her to a hotel to have sex with him. 

The 22-year-old from Kilburn, north west London, even filmed himself in sordid trysts and sent them to the youngster who was using her Nintendo DS to access Facebook. 

He was spared jail after a court heard how Miah, who has shared several of Choudary's fundamentalist tweets, struck up an online conversation about the Koran.  

Mansoor Miah walked free from court after sending explicit messages to a 15-year-old schoolgirl he was grooming over social media

When she told him she was uninterested in religion Miah, who worked in Tesco, carried on their conversations which turned to a sexual nature despite the girl having told him how old she was. 

He was handed a suspended sentence of 16 months at Southward Crown Court today. 

Earlier the court heard how he began speaking to the girl about Islam but soon forced the conversation in a sexual direction.  

'Having talked about Islam, undeterred, Mr Miah began to chat the complainant up,' prosecutor Stephen Requena said. 

'Having talked about Islam he proceeds to chat her up, having established her real age.

'He praises her physical appearance and asks if she has a boyfriend.'

The court heard how he sent her explicit photographs of himself, urging her to do the same before performing a sex act in front of her on webcam.  

He was arrested last year after one of the girl's teachers told her mother of their plans to meet in a Premier Inn in Kent. 

'The mother, it seems, was scared and felt her daughter was in danger when this was discovered.

'She describes her daughter as not that mature, which leaves her vulnerable,' added Mr Requena. 

The youngster was said to have had her laptop confiscated after engaging in explicit conversations with men on social media before meeting Miah. 

In a statement provided by her mother she was described as 'shy' and and 'uncomfortable' with new people.

Despite admitting to knowing the girl was underage, Miah claimed that he did not target her, adding: 'She looks 20.'

'He didn’t seek her out, he befriended her because she was a friend of a friend, not because she looks young, she looks 20,' said hi barrister Edward Jones said. 

'This was a young man confused about religious beliefs, smoking cannabis to significant degree. He has now sought to reform himself.

'He made a catastrophic error of judgement which he said would not be repeated.'

Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said while the defendant had planned 'some sort of sexual activity', he was not a 'predatory paedophile'.   

'You have not repeated this offence, so there is no evidence you are a predatory paedophile of the type I’m afraid we often see in this court, and the fact you didn't try again allows me to accept you were remorseful for your behaviour months before the police intervened.

'A suspended sentence is appropriate. 

'A prison sentence to mark the seriousness of what you did, and a course of treatment to ensure it doesn't happen again and to protect young girls.'

The judge added that if the pair had met up at the hotel or if Miah had approached another girl his sentence would have been more severe.

'The victim was just 15 and was young for her age, her mother said she was vulnerable and not streetwise. 

'You had no sexual experience. You were feeling depressed and isolated, you were smoking cannabis.

'I accept you were immature for your age and once these conversations were finished you did not talk to other girls.'

He also praised him for being 'helpful' to the police, who described him as a 'different person' from the one who had committed the offences.

Miah was also put on the sex offenders register and made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order. .
