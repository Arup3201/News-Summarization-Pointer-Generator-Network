Thousands of patients are being put at risk by GP surgeries that fail to meet basic standards of care and hygiene.

The NHS watchdog uncovered a catalogue of failings at more than 300 practices.

They included maggots on the floor of consulting rooms, patients given out-of-date medicines or injections, and nurses not trained in basic first aid.

At one surgery, inspectors arrived to find the only GP had been suspended by the General Medical Council and none of the locum doctors covering had shown up.

At another, the only two GPs had each referred the other to the GMC for alleged incompetence.

Patients at a third brought their own chairs because they had to sit outside for hours to get an appointment, the Care Quality Commission found.

A number of practices were putting patients in danger by using jabs for meningitis, cervical cancer and measles which were out of date and therefore probably ineffective. 

In ten cases, the failings were so severe they could ‘potentially affect thousands of people’. Several of the failing practices have been taken over or closed.

Professor Steve Field, the CQC’s chief inspector of GPs, said: ‘We found some surgeries where there were out of date vaccines in the fridge. If you think you’re immune and you’re not, you could then pick up the illness.

‘If a woman got pregnant and thought she was rubella immune and they picked up German measles... they could have a rubella baby – who are deaf-blind.’

Since April, inspectors from the CQC have visited 1,000 practices across England where concerns had already been raised about care.

They found one in three was failing to meet at least one basic standard.Professor Field, a family doctor and former head of the Royal College of GPs, said at one surgery in Birmingham patients had resorted to queuing outside ‘taking stools to sit on’ to get an appointment.

At another, the GP did not know how to turn on the oxygen cylinder used in emergencies. ‘This is not about knocking GPs, it’s about saying this is a standard we would expect you all to adhere to,’ said Professor Field.

At Dale Surgery in Sneinton, Nottingham, inspectors found maggots and other insects on the floors of consulting rooms.

At Dr Harira Syed in Rochdale, a nurse admitted she did not know how to give the kiss of life. The surgery with two warring GPs - Kingshurst Medical Practice in Birmingham - has been taken over and the pair forced to leave.

Patients at the Woodlands Practice in Chislehurst, Kent, where the only GP had been suspended, have been transferred to another surgery.

Over the next two years the CQC will inspect all 8,000 GP surgeries in England. From April, it will start investigating out-of-hours services.

Professor Field said: ‘We need to make sure that everyone, from the most well-off to the most disadvantaged, can get access to really good primary medical care.’

Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘Breaches of procedure cannot be condoned - even if they are isolated incidents - but the inspections were largely targeted at particular practices which had already been identified as having problems.’
