Singer Tulisa Contostavlos appeared to have had a Nigella-style makeover before she arrived at court in central London this morning to face a drugs charge.

The 25-year-old singer strode into Westminster Magistrates' Court in sky-high heels, coiffed blonde ringlets and full war-paint before denying one charge of supplying Class A drugs.

The N-Dubz star, of Friern Barnet, north London, is accused of setting up an £860 deal to sell 13.9g of cocaine to an undercover reporter.

She appeared alongside rapper Mike GLC, 
real name Michael Coombs, 35, of Enfield, north London. He too denied a
 charge of supplying the drug.

Tulisa Contostavlos, 25, appeared to have had a Nigella-style makeover before she strode into Westminster Magistrates' Court this morning.  Celebrity chef Lawson looked strikingly elegant when she arrived at Isleworth Crown Court earlier this month for the trial of her assistants, Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo

Contostavlos, who wore tight black trousers, a black top and black jacket, was forced to disclose her address to the court after her solicitor applied for it to be withheld to prevent 'unwanted visitors'.

But chief magistrate Howard Riddle ruled 'the address must be given' after considering the application with representations from prosecutor Emma Scheer and members of the Press.

The singer told the court: 'Just to let you know, after it being read out, in the next month or so I might have to move to a new address.'

The court heard how the charge relates to 13.9g of cocaine - dubbed 'white sweets' by Tulisa as a codename for the powder when talking to Mr Mahmood.

Emma Scheer, prosecuting, said: 'This was an investigation carried out by an investigative journalist at the Sun newspaper.

'On the March 28, Mazher Mahmood met Tulisa under the pretense of her playing a role in a forthcoming film.

'There was no reference to drugs in that meeting. He again met her later on May 10 at a hotel in London.

Holding her head up: Just like Lawson did two weeks ago, Contostavlos made sure she looked her best

'During the course of the conversation, Tulisa offered to supply cannabis and then cocaine to Mr Mahmood.

'She said she would use a code over the telephone, referring to cocaine as white sweets.

'There was a series of recorded phonecalls.

'On May 21, Mr Mahmood called Tulisa and said he would be in London and 
could she get him white sweets and she confirmed she could.

'On May 22, she arranged a table at a club called Whites.

'She then said she would text Mr Mahmood a number of a good friend of hers who would provide her with the sweets.

'That
 was the last contact he had with Tulisa. He then telephoned the number 
provided and spoke to a gentleman called Mr Coombs.'

Going, going... With large strides and an almost military swing of the arms, Tulisa tried to look in command of the situation as she ran the gauntlet of photographers 

The
 court heard that Coombs arranged to meet the journalist to supply the 
cocaine at the Dorchester hotel, where the meeting was covertly 
recorded.

Committing the 
case to trial at Southwark Crown Court, District Judge Howard Riddle 
said: 'This matter is not suitable for a summary trial and is too 
serious to be dealt with at the magistrates' court and will be sent to 
the Crown court.'

'This matter is too serious to be dealt with at the magistrates' court and will be sent to the Crown court.'

- District Judge Howard Riddle

Coombs, who wore a blue jumper and black jeans to attend court, is accused of supplying the drug on May 23.

Contostavlos,
 who was initially arrested in connection with the incident with Coombs 
on June 4, was officially dropped as a judge on X Factor days before her
 arrest, with Sharon Osbourne returning to the show in her place.

The
 pair, who were given unconditional bail by Mr Riddle, will next appear 
at Southwark Crown Court in central London on January 14.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced last week that it had authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge the former X Factor judge with 'being concerned in' the supply of Class A drugs.

CPS London chief Crown prosecutor Baljit Ubhey said: 'We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.'

Contostavlos denied the charge and will now appear at Southwark Crown Court on January 14 next year 

Different styles: Michael Coombs arrived for his court appearance in trainers, jeans and a blue cardigan, while Tulisa clearly decided the occasion called for a more glamorous look

Low-cut top: Tulisa chose an outfit with a plunging neckline. Even though Nigella's curves are more famous, she chose to cover up for her day in court

Last week Contostavlos' lawyer, Ben Rose, said that his client had joined a line of celebrities who had been used as 'fodder by greedy newspapers'.

He said: 'This was a deliberate attempt to target a young woman, who is all the more vulnerable because of her celebrity status.'

Contostavlos was initially arrested in connection with the incident with Coombs on June 4.

She was officially dropped as a judge on X Factor days before her arrest, with Sharon Osbourne returning to the show in her place.

A Sun spokesman defended the article, adding: 'The Sun on Sunday's investigation into Tulisa Contostavlos was entirely justified in the public interest.

'Ms Contostavlos is a self-described role model for young people and therefore has certain responsibilities.

'Throughout our investigation, our team followed the Press Complaints Commission Code and then handed over our dossier of evidence to the police.'

Tulisa might have taken some style tips from Nigella’s courtroom makeover, including wearing head-to-toe black, applying heavy make-up and tilting her chin just so, but the singer seems to have missed a few key points from the power dressing memo.

While Nigella buttoned up in a high-necked shirt and smart coat, Tulisa is showing off more cleavage than she ever did as an X-Factor judge.

She has carefully chosen an all-black outfit and ditched any attention-grabbing accessories but her choice of low-cut top is more distracting than any jewellery she could have worn.

Odd fashion choice: The ensemble looked suitably sombre for the occasion - except for Tulisa's hot pink nail varnish and £500 Christian Louboutin stiletto's, which made it look like she was rushing off to a nightclub 

Yes, there is a 28-year age gap between the two women, and Tulisa is a young women with a very different style than the 53-year-old chef. But Nigella‘s curves are far more famous than 25-year-old Tulisa’s and she still managed to restrain them for the sake of a court appearance.

In fact Nigella was very careful not to show any skin at all, choosing boots and thick tights for her legs, while Tulisa has decided to flash some ankle (a brave choice in December) and couldn’t resist wearing a pair of high-end, highly expensive stilettos.

No doubt Tulisa thinks her £500 Christian Louboutins make her look steely and serious, but in reality they make her look like she’s ready to bundle into a cab and head to G.A.Y. the minute the proceedings are over.

Her perfectly curled hair extensions and bright pink nails also jar with the sombre style she is trying to channel by wearing a smart black blazer and tailored trousers. But Tulisa does win style points for her make-up, copying her unlikely fashion inspiration Nigella with a strong brow and nude palette.
