To this day, the 1973 film The Exorcist ignites feelings of sheer terror in anyone brave enough to watch it. The only comfort afterwards is that at least it's only fictional.

But Jesuit scholars argue that the horrifying events truly did take place, when a young boy was demonically possessed in 1949.

Packed into a university library - at the school which was attended by the real 'possessed' child - scholars and experts debated whether there was truth in the parody, just in time for Halloween.

The real exorcism: Rev. John Padberg, director of the Institute of Jesuit Sources, tells a packed audience about the real demon-purging practice that took place at  St. Louis University's former hsopital

Jesuit scholars have joined a whole new generation of horror buffs in St. Louis to recount the supernatural incident.

Saint Louis University hosted the panel discussion yesterday on the exorcism, which 
involved the treatment of an unidentified suburban Washington, D.C., 
boy.

University junior Zach Grummer-Strawn has never seen 'The Exorcist' film, considered one of the finest examples of unadulterated cinematic terror. He's only vaguely familiar with the month-long 1949 demon-purging ritual at his school on which the film and William Peter Blatty's 1971 novel were based.

'I'd like to believe it's the real thing,' said Grummer-Strawn, a theology and sociology student from Atlanta. 'But you just can't know. That's part of why we're here. It's the pursuit of truth. And it's such a great story.'

Iconic: The demon-purging ritual performed on the 12-year-old girl in the film was also carried out over a month-long period on a 13-year-old boy at the Missouri school's former hospital

About 500 people crammed into Pius XII Library, with some spilling into the aisles, leaning against pillars or sitting on desks.

The university scholars and guest speaker Thomas Allen, author of a 1993 account of the events at the school's former Alexian Brothers Hospital, emphasized that definitive proof that the boy known only as 'Robbie' was possessed by malevolent spirits is unattainable. Maybe he instead suffered from mental illness or sexual abuse - or fabricated the entire experience.

Assisted: The exorcism was carried out on the child by Father William Bowdern, who was assisted by Rev. Walter H. Halloran, pictured. Holloran expressed his skepticism about potential paranormal events before his death

Like most of religion's basic tenets, it ultimately comes down to faith.

'If the devil can convince us he does not exist, then half the battle is won,' said the Rev. Paul Stark, vice president for mission and ministry at the 195-year-old Catholic school.

He opened the discussion with a prayer from the church's exorcism handbook, imploring God to 'fill your servants with courage to fight that reprobate dragon.'

Some of the non-students in the audience spoke of personal connections to an episode that has enthralled generations of St. Louis residents.

One man described living near the suburban St. Louis home where the 13-year-old boy arrived in the winter of 1949 (his Lutheran mother was a St. Louis native who married a Catholic).

Another said she was a distant cousin of Father William Bowdern, who led the exorcism ritual after consulting with the archbishop of St. Louis, but remained publicly silent about his experiences - though he did tell Allen it was 'the real thing'.

Bowdern died in 1983.

Bowdern was assisted by the Rev. Walter Halloran, who unlike his colleague spoke openly with Allen and expressed his skepticism about potential paranormal events before his death a decade ago.

'He talked more about the boy, and how much he suffered, and less about the rite,' Allen said. 'Here was a scared, confused boy caught up in something he didn't understand.

'He told me, "I simply don't know," and that is where I leave it,' the author added. 'I just don't know.'

Allen zealously protects the anonymity of 'Robbie,' despite others' efforts to track him down to this day.

It is unlikely the young boy's head was spinning 360 degrees, as actress Linda Blair's did in the 1973 film

Gary Mackey, a 59-year-old accountant who left work early to attend the campus event, said he also is unsure whether 'The Exorcist' was a work of fiction or instead a riveting real-life account of barely comprehensible forces.

He does know this: He cannot forget the movie that he saw with a buddy four decades ago. They drove 100 miles (160 kilometers) from their home in Louisville, Kentucky, to the nearest theater showing it across the state line in Cincinnati.

'I saw the movie when I was 19 years old and it scared me to death,' Mackey said. 'I think it's the scariest movie ever made.'
