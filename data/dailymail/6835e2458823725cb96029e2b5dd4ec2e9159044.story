He should play in the Major League.

San Francisco Giants fan Rob Winner made a splash on Father's Day after catching a home run ball with one glove-free hand while holding onto son Thomas with the other.

The father said he'd just finished changing his one-year-old son's diaper and was returning to his seat at AT&T Park in San Francisco when a ball soared into the outfield bleachers.

'I was waiting, talking to Gary the usher and saw the ball got hit that way, then stepped up, reached up, caught it and went back to my seat,' the San Rafael fire captain told ABC 7 News.

Gripping! Giants fan Rob had just changed his son's diaper and was talking to an usher at AT&T Park when he caught the ball

Winner was at the baseball with his wife Lindsay on Sunday to watch his favorite team, theÂ Giants, play the Colorado Rockies. It was Colorado's Troy Tulowitzki home run ball that Winner caught.

'It's Tulowitzki's first Father's Day. He wanted the ball back. So I gave him the ball and he gave me an autographed ball from him,' Winner told ABC 7 News.

Winner said he planned to add the ball to the family collection of baseball memorabilia.

'I got a ball signed by Lefty Gomez when I was five. My dad introduced me to him and had him sign it, it's one of my fondest memories, so I hope this will be great memory for Thomas,' he said.

The Rockies won the game.
