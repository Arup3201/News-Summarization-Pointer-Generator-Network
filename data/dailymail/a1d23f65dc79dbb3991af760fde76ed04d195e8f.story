Today's storm was predicted to be the worst since the Great Storm of 1987, which battered England and Wales leaving 18 people dead and causing £1.5billion worth of damage to the economy.

In the early hours of October 16 winds peaked at more than 120mph, damaging buildings and felling 15million trees in the south east of England.

Millions of homes were left without 
power for at least a few hours, with some having no electricity for days
 as trees fell on power lines, disrupting supplies.

Damage: An uprooted tree lies across a car in London after the Great Storm on October 15, 1987, which claimed 18 lives

Powerful: The highest gust recorded from the storm was at Gorleston, Norfolk, hitting 122mph

Whilst
 most of England and Wales experienced wet and windy weather that night,
 it was southern and eastern parts of England that were worst hit.

The highest gust recorded from the storm was at Gorleston, Norfolk, hitting 122mph.

A ship capsized at Dover, and a Channel ferry was driven ashore near Folkestone.

Veteran weatherman Michael Fish bore 
the brunt for famously telling the nation there was no hurricane in the 
offing, just hours before it arrived.

At the time Mr Fish told viewers tuning 
into the broadcast: ‘Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC 
and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way; well, if you’re 
watching, don’t worry, there isn’t, but having said that, actually, the 
weather will become very windy, but most of the strong winds, 
incidentally, will be down over Spain and across into France.’

Britain is set to be hit by the worst weather since the Great Storm of 1987 when this tree crashed over in Eynsford, Kent

But in 2011, one of his former colleagues finally stepped forward to take the blame for the Met Office’s botched forecast.

Bill
 Giles, who was chief forecaster at the time, admitted that he was in 
fact responsible for the lunchtime broadcast on October 15 in 1987.

It
 was the worst storm since 1703 and a public enquiry was announced 
shortly after the storm and an internal enquiry was conducted by the Met
 Office.

The official forecaster wrote: 'We now know that the strength of the storm was boosted by a 
phenomenon known as the ‘Sting Jet’, where cold dry air descends into 
storms high in the atmosphere.

'Rain
 or snow falling into this jet of air evaporates and cools the air 
further, adding more energy which translates into stronger winds. By the
 time this ‘sting in the tail’ reaches the ground it can produce winds 
of 100mph which are concentrated over a small area.

'In
 1987, no-one knew sting jets even existed, but now they are well 
understood and included in forecast models. The storm which affected 
Scotland in December 2011 was boosted by a sting jet, explaining the 
maximum gust speed of 164mph recorded on top of Cairngorm.'
