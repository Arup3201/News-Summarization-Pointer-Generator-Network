It's not quite Victoria's Secret but Sky-High Underwear did their best to add a shot of glamour to proceedings as Hong Kong Fashion Week kicked off.

Although Cara, Doutzen and co were nowhere to be seen, the label sent models down the catwalk decked in racy lingerie livened up with the sort of unusual accessories that have become the American brand's trademark.

Venetian masks, cowboy hats and carnivalesque tails were all present and correct, while models carried realistic-looking toy guns.

Earlier, Indonesian designer Linda Mariani, a favourite of local fashionistas, drew gasps from the watching crowd as she unveiled her vision for next autumn in vivid style.

Among the pieces to appear on the catwalk was a show-stopping crimson evening gown, complete with a vast rosette, and a beautiful kimono-inspired frock executed in cobalt silk.

Also taking to the catwalk at Hong Kong Fashion Week was Burma's Mogok Pauk Pauk, one of the few designers to emerge from the country, and who began her career as a bridal specialist in Mandalay.

Her training was clearly in evidence, as she plumped for a palette focused on bride-friendly gold, cream and ivory.

Not everything screamed wedding day however. In what looked like a bid to impress China's moneyed classes, there were jewels and embellishment aplenty, as well as a liberal hand with marabou trim.

Later this week, designs by Angola's Allexandre Kangala and Frenchman Pascal 
Piveteau are due to appear on the runway, while British brands Aquascutum and Vivienne Westwood are among those exhibiting.

The event, which pulls in 1, 850 exhibitors from 29 different countries and runs until 16th January, also offers local brands the chance to persuade the watching world that they're worth investing in, among them 2%, Adlib, Biba, Che Che New 
York, Dorian Ho, i.t and Moiselle.
