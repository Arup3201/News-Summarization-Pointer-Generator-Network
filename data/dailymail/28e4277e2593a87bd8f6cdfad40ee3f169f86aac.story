Ruling: Sir James Munby, pictured, President of the Family Division of the High Court, revealed the girl was initially against having an abortion but she later changed her mind

A girl of 13 with the intellect of a child half her age has had an abortion - after becoming pregnant by a 14-year-old boy, it has been revealed today.

The teenager was 14 weeks pregnant and had been described by a psychiatrist as 'very damaged and impaired'.

At first she was against having an abortion but she later changed her mind, a judge has revealed.

The details emerged in a written ruling 
by Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division of the High Court -
 and the most senior family judge in England and Wales.

It followed an earlier 
hearing in the Family Division of the High Court.

Sir James said he had been asked to decide whether the pregnancy should be terminated.

The judge said evidence had been prepared on the basis that the teenager was opposed to a termination.

But when the hearing began she was 'wavering' and by the end she had wanted a termination.

He said the 'preponderance of evidence” pointed to a termination being in the girl’s best interests and said he had, in any event, concluded that a termination was in her best interests.

He added that the youngster’s pregnancy had been terminated.

Sir James said the teenager was the subject of on-going family court care proceedings.

And he said there would have been 'very little chance' of her being able to keep the baby.

He said a psychologist had assessed the girl as having the comprehension of a seven-year-old and the vocabulary of a six-year-old.

A psychiatrist said the girl understood that termination meant the death of her baby but did not have a full understanding of what pregnancy involved.

Sir James, who handed down his ruling at a public hearing in London, said the youngster could not be identified.
