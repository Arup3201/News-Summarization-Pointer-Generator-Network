Chris Coleman has told his Wales team it is time to deliver where he and others failed and live up to a reputation for being the country’s golden generation.

The national manager was in buoyant mood ahead of Bosnia’s visit to what should be a near-capacity Cardiff City Stadium on Friday night, and did not play down the magnitude of this opportunity for Wales to reach their first major tournament since 1958.

Coleman was part of a glittering era himself, when the likes of Neville Southall, Mark Hughes, Ian Rush, and Ryan Giggs could appear in the same line-up — but never made it past qualifying rounds for World Cups or European Championships.

Now there is another impressive collection of talent, spearheaded of course by Gareth Bale, and a better chance than ever before due to the expansion of the tournament.

Bosnia are the visitors on Friday night, followed by Cyprus on Monday, and Coleman believes this is the long weekend when Wales can show their character and make a move in Group B, having beaten Andorra in their opening game.

‘They have a great chance to live up to the tag they have been given as the golden generation,’ said Coleman, who made his Wales debut in 1992. ‘I thought the first Welsh team I played in was the golden generation, with Neville Southall, Mark Hughes, Ian Rush, Dean Saunders, Gary Speed and Ryan Giggs. What a team that was, but we did not do it.

‘These boys have also been handed that label, and they will live up to it if they do the business.

‘It is awful when you are part of an international outfit that gets so close and you don’t do it. I don’t want that again, I want to be part of a team that does something no-one else has.’

Injuries to Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen have dulled the golden sheen somewhat, and further withdrawals by David Vaughan, Andrew Crofts and Lee Evans have left midfield looking thin. It may mean Coleman persists with his 5-3-2 formation to get Tottenham’s Ben Davies and Swansea’s Neil Taylor into the side, with captain Ashley Williams, Hull’s James Chester and Chris Gunter, winning his 56th cap, offering a solid backline.

Bale should be given a central role again, having scored a brace in Andorra. He now has 14 Wales goals and needs only two to surpass the great John Charles, and three to better Hughes. Rush, the top Welsh scorer, has 28 but is within range for a player still only 25. Almost 30,000 fans are expected in Cardiff — the biggest crowd since England arrived at the Millenium Stadium in 2011. 

‘They wouldn’t come if they didn’t think we had a chance of doing well,’ said Coleman. Bosnia, despite boasting Edin Dzeko, Asmir Begovic, and Roma’s Miralem Pjanic, lost 2-1 to Cyprus in their opening match and Williams wants Wales to turn the screw. ‘We know it is important,’ said the Swansea defender. ‘They are a strong side. We need to stamp our authority, get the job done.’
