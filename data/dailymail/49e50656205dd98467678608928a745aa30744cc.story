A herd of mountain goats were caught in bad weather in the Rocky Mountains, and dashed down the rocky sides in a frantic escape.

The young kids became terrified as the storm clouds rolled in and lightning struck behind them.

Shortly after happily playing under a blue sky, their eyes widen with fear and  a mad rush follows to find cover as the babies head down the mountain as fast as possible.

The photos were taken over 14,000 feet high on Mount Evans in Colorado, US.

Nature photographer Verdon Tomajko, 44, from Boulder, Colorado, snapped the action with his wife for over an hour.

He
 said: ‘I was driving up to the top of the mountain one afternoon when, 
as we drove above the tree line, it became very stormy and rainy.

‘We
 got to the top and figured we would try to wait out the storm for a 
while, so we had a little snack and waited in the car for the storm to 
pass.

‘Fortunately, it passed and the sky 
opened up to a bright blue on top of the mountain but, looking down, the
 sky was still very dark.

Playtime: Earlier in the day the kids were happily playing on the giant boulders while their parents grazed nearby

‘We watched the goats play leisurely around while the adults watched nearby.

‘Giant white clouds started rolling in and we could see dark storm clouds coming closely behind.

‘As the storm came closer, the baby goats started running around with a nervous energy - jumping all over the rocks with incredible agility.

‘By now the storm was directly overhead and had started to rain, so everyone else that was on top with us had gone lower to escape the storm.

‘I kept shooting until my wife told me that my hair was standing straight up on end from the electricity in the air!

‘This was one of the best days I have had photographing the mountain goats on Mount Evans.’
