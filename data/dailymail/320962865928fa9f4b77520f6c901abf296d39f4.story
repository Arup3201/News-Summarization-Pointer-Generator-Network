She may only be 18 but Kendall Jenner is already the star of a TV show, has her own clothing line, is a clothes horse for Chanel and this week made her debut in Vogue Paris.

And now, one of the industry's most acclaimed stylists has revealed exactly what it is that makes the youngest of the Kardashian clan so appealing.

Speaking to Grazia Daily, LOVE Magazine's Editor-in-Chief Katie Grand, who styled Kendall for her glossy Vogue shoot, has nothing but praise for the hardworking young model.

Model behaviour: Kendall Jenner's stylist, who worked with her on the Vogue Paris shoot, has opened up about what makes the 18-year-old stand out from the rest

Describing her as a 'pleasure' to work with, Katie explains that Kendall has made well informed decisions about working in fashion. 

'She is unique in wanting to turn her back on her celebrity when it comes to modelling,' she said.

'It would have been easy for Kendall to go with a bigger agency and gone down a celebrity route but she wants to be taken seriously as a model just like the rest of them.'

Her wise move has paid off - in just a year, Kendall has walked for Giles, Chanel, Marc Jacobs and been invited to sit beside Anna Wintour on the Topshop Unique front row.

And it seems that Kendall, who loves listening to 50 Cent when on a shoot, has learnt from a certain sister of hers.

'I had dinner with Kim right before the wedding and her and Kendall are quite similar, they take work really seriously, they're fun and have a good time but work comes first,' said Katie.

And it 
isn't just a good work ethic that the half-sisters share. Kendall caused
 a few double takes when she posted a picture of herself on Instagram 
emulating Kim in more ways than one yesterday.

With the same hair style, smoky eyes and
neutral shade of lip colour to the 
natural-toned make-up that Kim, 33, favours, the pair look uncannily similar.

Kim is every bit the doting sister, as 
she displayed earlier this month when she shared a snap of the two at 
Met Gala in New York.

'Best 
thing in life is sharing memories with the ones you love! From getting 
ready together to experiencing the night I'm happy you were at my side 
@kendalljenner I love you my model baby!!!,' she captioned it.

Kendall and sister Kylie, meanwhile, spoke to eTalk in Canada about Kim and Kanye West's nuptials.

In
 the interview set to air on Thursday night, Kylie called the wedding in
 Florence 'amazing,' adding:  'We can't say much, but it was amazing.'

Kendall chimed in: 'It was beautiful. It was filled with a lot of love.'

Most watched: Kim seems to attract attention 
everywhere she goes; Kendall was Kim's shadow on a sisters' day out in 
LA on March 15 

Before the makeover: Kendall was just an average
 fresh-faced 16-year-old in 2012 during a shopping excursion with Kim in
 West Hollywood

Influence: Kendall and Kim both had that model 
walk as they stepped out in Paris on May 21 just a few days before the 
big wedding
