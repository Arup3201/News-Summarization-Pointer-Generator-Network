Aston Villa fans should be in little doubt. Paul Lambert’s side will struggle to stay out of a relegation battle this term.

Despite pre-season spirits being higher than they should be - testament to an honest support whose expectations have sadly dropped to an all-time low – Villa are sixth favourites to be relegated from the Premier League for the first time. In truth, that’s generous.

Five years ago, Europa League was a prerequisite at Villa Park. Now, the only desire is to stay alive while hoping the club is sold before long.

Worry: Villa have been ever-presents in the Premier League, but they are 3-1 to get relegated

Last chance: Manager Paul Lambert is heading into his third season as Villa boss after two disappointing campaigns

What’s going against Villa? A wantaway owner who can’t find a buyer despite lowering the asking price. A manager nobody wants but with no alternative. Three consecutive seasons of failing to muster up more than 41 points. Three signings you’d be pleased with on the 2004 version of Championship Manager. Just 15 Premier League home wins out of a possible 57. And Roy Keane is now involved to help steady the ship. Their last three top flight finishes – 16th, 15th and 15th – suggests this could be the year.

What’s going for Aston Villa? History… and optimism.

The last two factors do count for something. If Villa are to attract a buyer – at the £150million asking price or below – the club’s proud past is a selling point. After all, that’s what brought Randy Lerner to the Midlands in the first place (Villa finished 16th the season before the American’s arrival); the 26 consecutive years of top flight football and wide fan base does help.

More importantly, optimism and positivity
 may see Villa through a fifth straight relegation dog fight. Whether 
it's token pre-season hope or real evidence of a change in fortunes on 
the horizon, Villa fans realise they desperately need to get behind the 
team again for a make-or-break season.

Helping hand? Former Sunderland and Ipswich boss Roy Keane has been brought in as Lambert's assistant

The murmurs of discontent have calmed somewhat as we approach the equivalent of Villa's D-Day, drawn out over 38 games. But the events of the summer have done little to convince us the club's ever-present Premier League tag will keep for another season.

The signings

Paul Lambert finally gave in to fans’ cries when things got desperate last year by admitting the club needed experience, six months and a transfer window after the Holte End had made that very observation.

Lambert moved quick this summer to bring in Philippe Senderos (29), Kieran Richardson (29) and Joe Cole (32). Experience box ticked in one swoop. All three have something to prove, but hardly set fans' imagination alight.

If all three had signed for a Championship side this summer, you wouldn't bat an eyelid.

Cole in particular has bags of experience, but struggled in the Premier League even during his romantic return to West Ham. His injury problems are a whole other issue - exactly what Villa don't need.

Senderos is back-up and Richardson could prove handy, but Villa's exit door is still open, with the futures of Fabian Delph and Ron Vlaar still uncertain. There is a real possibility the team could be in worse shape than 12 months ago come September 2.

Something to prove: At 32, Joe Cole has been given another chance in the Premier League

The manager

Hands tied? Yes. A sticky situation? Certainly. But Lambert hasn't helped himself. Home form must improve, and the criticisms of the Scot's lack of tactical awareness have been loud and understandable.

This transfer window has been the polar opposite to his four previous, where Villa took gambles on youth.

In drastically changing, Lambert has admitted his previous faults in the market, and knows this is his final chance. It's third time lucky in what should be his third and final season at Villa.

Underperformed: Villa have won just 11 home league games under Lambert, finishing 15th twice

The assistant manager

Roy Keane has the potential to destroy morale as quickly as he raises it. Appointing the Irishman was Villa's riskiest move of the summer but the fear should give certain players a lift and separate the men from the boys.

Delph and Ashley Westwood could also learn a thing or two from one of the greatest central midfielders to have graced the game.

But it is widely assumed, and rightly so, that if Lambert is sacked at some point during the season, Keane will take over. Again, that appointment could go either way.

The owner

When Villa were put on the market in May, it was naive to expect a quick takeover before the new season. Attaining a club is more than a swing by the corner shop. But Lerner can't even get out of the front door and pass the first hurdle; finding a suitable buyer.

Lerner wishes to hand over the club to a chairman with the same intentions as himself; healthy, sustainable investment without ruining the identity of the club.

Patience is key here, but if another six months passes with no movement, the American may sell to anybody.

Attractive: Villa's proud history and tradition should entice buyers, but that hasn't been the case as yet

Flog it: Randy Lerner has struggled to find a suitable buyer for the club, despite reducing the asking price

The bomb squad

Darren Bent, Alan Hutton and Charles N'Zogbia are back in the fold after being all but ignored by Lambert. Villa are desperate, and the experience of the three - whose transfer fees total £38m - is something the Scot sees as beneficial to a young squad.

He even allowed Shay Given to become his right-hand man towards the end of last season, despite the Irish goalkeeper earlier admitting the club previously wanted him out the door.

Second chances have been handed out and the slate is so clean Lambert can see his own face in it. But Bent, Hutton and N'Zogbia have big egos.

While all is forgiven now, a few defeats down the line the situation could turn sour. Assistant Keane still has one of the biggest attitudes in football - allowing him to get stuck in to high-earners moping around Bodymoor Heath could equal disaster.
