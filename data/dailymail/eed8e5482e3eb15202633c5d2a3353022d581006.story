A power cut has left three fuel storage pools at Japan's tsunami-damaged nuclear plant without fresh cooling water for nearly 24 hours, raising concerns about the fragility of the tsunami-ravaged nuclear plant.

The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant's operator said the temperatures in the pools was within safe limits and would remain so for four days, but the incident has highlighted the problems caused by the continued use of makeshift equipment at the damaged plant.

A spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said the reactors were not affected by the power outage and said staff were preparing a back-up system in case the repairs did not fix the problem.

Masayuki Ono said: 'If the worst comes to the worst, we have a backup water injection system.'

The command centre at the plant suffered a brief power failure just before 7pm local time (10am GMT) yesterday, knocking out the cooling facilities for four fuel ponds.

Electricity was quickly restored to the command centre, and by Tuesday afternoon (this morning, London time) the cooling system had been restored at one of the pools, but three - the pools in reactors 1, 3 and 4, were still broken at 6pm in Japan (9am GMT).

Having investigated the cause of the power cut, the company concluded that it might be due to problems with each of the switchboards for the pools., and began to prepare spare switchboards for use if it could not fix the original ones.

TEPCO said that while the temperature in the affected pools had risen slightly, it was still well below the target control temperature.

It said the reactors were unaffected and no other abnormalities were found.

The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami destroyed the plant's power and cooling systems, causing three reactor cores to melt and fuel storage pools to overheat.

Since then, the plant is now using makeshift systems.  This latest incident is a major test for TEPCO to see if it has learned anything from 2011's disaster.

TEPCO, which has been accused of a string of cover-ups, was heavily criticsed by local media today for waiting hours before disclosing details of the power cut.

Its spokeman Mr Ono acknowledged that the plant was vulnerable, saying: 'Fukushima Dai-ichi still runs on makeshift equipment and we are trying to switch to something more permanent and dependable, which is more desirable.

'Considering the equipment situation, we may be pushing a little too hard.'

Mr Ono said the utility did not immediately try to switch to a back-up cooling system because doing so without finding and fixing the cause could lead to a repeat of the problem.

There is a backup cooling system but no backup outside power, he said.

Regulators have previously raised concerns about the makeshift equipment, and have urged the plant to switch them to a more permanent arrangement.

The operator still has to remove melted, fatally radioactive fuel from the reactors before fully decommissioning the plant, which officials say could take 40 years.

The tsunami on 11 March 2011 saw huge waves knock out the cooling facilities at the nuclear power plant.  As a result the reactors overheated and went into meltdown.

The plant has since been stabilised but the full effect of the disaster is yet to be ascertained.

Yoshihide Suga, the chief government spokesman, sought to allay concerns today, saying: 'In a sense, we have put in place measures that leave no room for worry.'
