Phil Neville has revealed that Manchester United were 'really interested' in signing Blaise Matuidi when his contract was running out last season.

The Paris Saint-Germain midfielder shone against Chelsea on Tuesday night and provided the cross for Edinson Cavani to head home the equaliser.

Neville, who worked under David Moyes at Old Trafford, admitted in an interview with BBC's 5 Live that United attempted to sign the Frenchman.

He said: 'We wanted to sign him. We'd heard his contract was running out and we were really interested in him.

'Then he signed a contract with PSG, which was obviously something we weren't happy with.

'We were looking at it at Man Utd last year to inject a little bit of energy. He runs from box to box and he carried the team forward simply through his energy on that left channel'.

Matuidi joined PSG from Saint-Étienne in 2011 and has now established himself as one of the best midfielders in world football.

With United lacking midfielders and being forced to play Wayne Rooney deeper - the PSG player would be a perfect fit for Louis van Gaal's side.
