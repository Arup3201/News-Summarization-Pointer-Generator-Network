Sam Rush stopped short of a bunch of flowers and a candlelit dinner for two but, one year on, the Derby chief executive clearly remains enamoured with his head coach.

Happy anniversary  Steve McClaren, who will be hoping to swap the tradition cotton gift for something a little more glittery in eight months time.

A warm and glowing tribute in the match programme from Rush and three more Championship points will have to do for now.

Man of the match: Hughes

They were hard-earned points too, with late goals from Will Hughes and Chris Martin after Bournemouth goalkeeper Lee Camp (right) was sent off for handling outside the area.

Camp is a lifelong Derby fan, having been born and brought up in the city. He will be cast in the role of villain forever at the iPro Stadium, because he once also played for Nottingham Forest.

There was little sympathy, therefore, when Camp went rushing out of his area to stop Jamie Ward, who emerged from the clash to shoot into an empty net. That is when the trouble started. Referee Scott Mathieson pulled the play back, disallowed the goal and dismissed Camp. Both sets of players argued for several minutes before Chris Martin took the free kick and hit a post.

‘We feel quite hard done by,’ said Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe. ‘We would have preferred to go one goal down and keep 11 men on the pitch.’

McClaren’s verdict was similar, although from a vantage point of fourth in the table. ‘We’ve put down a big marker, a big statement,’ said the Derby manager.

‘The sending off was a bizarre decision. We would have taken the goal and kept it at 11-11. The players knew that this was important and they were a little nervous. But we were patient and controlled the game and it’s all about the result.’

Even down to 10 men, Bournemouth defended well and made it difficult for the home side.

Hughes finally made the breakthrough after a one-two with Martin, who then scored his seventh of the season deep into injury time after a great cross from Russell. McClaren joked afterwards that Hughes has been practising his shooting ‘and his shots reach the goal now’.

Bournemouth had to perform with a tiny band of followers as the Football League piloted a scheme in which the match was broadcast live at the Goldsands Stadium.

When the sides meet again in February, the same will apply for Derby fans. McClaren will be hoping to be in the automatic promotion places by then.
