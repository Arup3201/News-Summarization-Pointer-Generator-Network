One in ten young people have admit being sexually violent towards their partner, shocking new statistics show.

The majority of 14 to 21-year-olds, questioned by the University of New Hampshire, reported using coercive
 tactics, such as arguing, putting pressure on a partner, getting angry 
or making someone feel guilty, rather than using threats or physical 
force.

However, two per cent of respondents admitted rape and three per cent admitted attempted rape.

Most often the victims were a romantic partner and more than half of the perpetrators blamed the victim for the sexual violence, although many said they had also seen films or 
other media that depicted sexual and violent situations.

The most common first-time age for experiencing sexual violence was 16 years old, but males were overwhelmingly more 
likely to be sexually violent to a partner at 15 years of age or younger.

Yet nearly all escaped punishment because the victim told no-one, according to the researchers.

The American study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, found nine per cent of those aged 21 or younger reported to carrying out some form of sexual violence.

While eight per cent kissed, touched or made someone else do something sexual knowing the other person did not want to.

The study estimated adolescent sexual
 violence perpetration after 
analysing data for 1,058 young people between the ages of 14 and 21 in the Growing Up with Media study. 

They focused on sexual violence as coercive and forced sexual behaviour.

Three per cent admitted to having coercive sex by getting someone to sleep with them when they knew the other person didn't want to, and another three per cent attempted rape.

Dr Kimberly Mitchell of the University of New Hampshire said: 'Links between perpetration and violent sexual media are apparent, suggesting a need to monitor adolescents’ consumption of this material, particularly given today’s media saturation among the adolescent population.

'Because blaming victims appears to be common while perpetrators experiencing consequences is not, there is urgent need for high school and middle school programmes aimed at supporting bystander intervention.'
