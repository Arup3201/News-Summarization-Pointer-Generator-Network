A millionaire CEO and his wife who died following a mysterious house fire had both been stabbed multiple times, it has emerged.

Cooper Health System CEO John P. Sheridan Jr. and his wife, Joyce, were pulled from their house in Montgomery Township, New Jersey on September 28 after an 'intentionally set' fire, police said.

Mr Sheridan, a 72-year-old ally of New Jersey governor Chris Christie, was pronounced dead at the scene, while his retired teacher wife, 69, suffered cardiac arrest and later passed away at hospital.

Authorities have released few details about the investigation and have made no arrests in the case.

Mystery: John Sheridan Jr., 72, and his wife Joyce, 69, both died after a fire was intentionally set at their New Jersey home. It has now emerged that both had suffered stab wounds before the fire

But a source familiar with the investigation told the Philadelphia Inquirer that Sheridan suffered stab wounds to his neck and on one side of his body, while his wife had been repeatedly stabbed in the upper body and chest.

Two knives were recovered from the scene although a third weapon, which authorities believe caused the wounds to Mr Sheridan's neck and side, has not been found, a source said. 

Authorities have already said the fire, which was started with gasoline and confined to the bedroom of the couple's home, was intentionally set. The gas can was found in the bedroom.

Investigators and lawyers from the Attorney General's Office and detectives from the New Jersey State Police have been drafted in to help with the 'very complex case', the paper reported.

A possible motive has not been released by authorities but they have indicated that they believe the couple's four sons had no involvement in the deaths. 

Questions: Police tape can be seen outside the couple's Montgomery Township home in September. The fire was confined to their master bedroom and a gasoline can was found inside the room

This leaves open two possibilities: murder-suicide or homicide, the Inquirer reported. The Prosecutor's Office has said there is no threat to the public.

Law enforcement officials have said they were awaiting additional test results and a report from the medical examiner's office to shed light on the Sheridans' cause of death. 

The couple's neighbor, who called 911 that morning after smelling burning, told the dispatcher that when he knocked on the Sheridans' front door, he could hear banging and what he believed to be a person trying to get out of a room upstairs, according to previous reports.

But Captain Jack Bennett, a spokesman for the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office, said that what the man heard were actually the sounds from the raging fire, and not a person banging.

The couple's sons released a statement on Tuesday reading: 'Real answers will only come after a full and thorough investigation.

'We are committed to getting to the truth and that means we will not comment while the investigation is ongoing.' 

The men have hired Michael Baden, a top forensic pathologist, to assist them in the case. 

They have also started a process with the Somerset County Surrogate's Office to handle their parents' estate because a will for the couple has not been found.

The couple owned two homes, the $512,000 house where the fire unfolded and another in New York.

Mr Sheridan was president and CEO of Camden-based Cooper University Health Care, which has more than 700 physicians and serves more than half a million patients a year.

NJBiz valued his company at $913 million earlier this year. 

Sheridan, a Republican, also had ties to Governor Chris Christie and served as general counsel to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. 

Remembered: Hundreds of people, including Christie, attended the couple's memorial in October

The couple's joint memorial service drew hundreds of mourners including Chris Christie and four of his predecessors, former governors Jim Florio, Christine Whitman, Tom Kean and Don DiFrancesco.

As well as their four sons, the couple left behind three grandchildren.

In a case unrelated to the fire, one of the couple's sons, Matthew Sheridan, 40, was arrested hours after their deaths for cocaine possession and possession of drug paraphernalia found in his car.

The Prosecutor's Office has not yet pursued the charges against Matthew, who lived with his parents, but has five years to do so.
