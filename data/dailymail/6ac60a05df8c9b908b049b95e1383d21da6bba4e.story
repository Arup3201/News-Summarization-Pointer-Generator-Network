Tran tragedy: Gary Thompson, 33, was crushed to death by a tram in Manchester city centre last night

A blind golfer was crushed to death by a tram after he accidentally stepped off a platform seconds before it arrived at the station.

Gary Thompson, 33, who is believed to have been out at a work Christmas party, was trapped by his chest in Manchester city centre last night.

Although witnesses raised the alarm the keen sportsman was later pronounced dead.

Mr Thompson, a volunteer at the Imperial
War Museum North, was with a friend who had walked him to the station.

But it is thought he then mistimed his approach and fell off the platform in front of the incoming tram. Security guards ran from a nearby hotel to help but the man could not be saved.

Watch Commander Ian Spaven, from Manchester Central station, was one of the first on the scene.

He said: 'It looked as though the man had stepped from the platform in front of the tram as it was pulling in.

'Our job then was to provide dignity and reduce the impact on the witnesses. According to all accounts it appears to have been a tragic accident.'

Mr Thompson, from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, was hit at around 11pm last night.

He appeared in a local newspaper in 2006 in an appeal for a guide to help him play golf after taking up the sport despite his disability.

He was born with deteriorating vision, lost all sight in his right eye at the age of eight and was registered blind.

Mr Thompson also enjoyed swimming, darts, indoor bowls and snooker.

The North West Ambulance Service said they were inundated with calls from onlookers.

A
spokeswoman said: 'We responded to reports of a male trapped under a 
tram. He had suffered serious injuries and was pronounced dead at the 
scene.'

Emergency services work at the scene after Mr Thompson was crushed to death in St Peter's Square, Manchester, last night

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'A man has died following a collision in Manchester city centre.

'Shortly after 11.05pm on 15 December, police were called to St Peterâ€™s Square following reports a man had collided with a tram. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

'The tram service was suspended for several hours while emergency services dealt with this incident.'

Several people dialled 999 after the blind man was struck and killed by this tram in Manchester last night

A spokesman for the Imperial War Museum North said Mr Thompson had worked as a volunteer with them for the last four years.

He said: 'The team at IWM North are devastated to hear about the tragic accident involving Gary Thompson.

'Gary started volunteering at the museum in 2007 helping visitors to get the most from their visit and was an extremely valued member of the Volunteer team.

'Although visually impaired Gary was exceptionally independent and had a courageous spirit.

'He was very active in the museum world providing advice and support for access issues at IWM North and other museums and organizations in the region.'

Mr Thompson is the seventh person to be killed by trams in Manchester since 1992.

His parents Corrine and Eric, and his brother Karl, said in a statement that Gary lived a 'fulfilling life'

They said: 'Gary was a son and brother we are all proud of. He overcame his disabilities and lived a fulfilling life, achieving a degree at Bolton University in business management earlier this year.

'Gary enjoyed writing poetry and had a number of poems published.

'He did a lot of work for the community, including volunteering at the Imperial War Museum North as a guide.

'The family have suffered a tragic loss due to unavoidable circumstances. We thank the emergency service personnel who attended what must have been a very difficult incident to deal with.

'Gary had a wide circle of friends from a wide cross-section of the community and had a good sense of values and humour.'
