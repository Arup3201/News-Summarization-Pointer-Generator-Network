Poor children must learn how to behave in an ‘alien middle class world’ to help them get on in life, a government adviser has suggested.

Working class families are urged to watch plays, visit museums and try middle class food, restaurants and shops to broaden their child’s life experience.

Peter Brant, head of policy at the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, warned talented children from poorer backgrounds were not applying to university because they were worried about ‘fitting in’.

Performance in exams is not the only thing holding working class children back, argues Peter Brant

The dominance of the middle classes in political life has been condemned by former Prime Minister Sir John Major.

Education Secretary Michael Gove has vowed to narrow the attainment gap, insisting that some state schools are now better than private schools.

But Mr Brant warned that it can be ‘incredibly difficult’ for working class children to ‘culturally fit into middle class lifestyle and jobs’.

He said this was not just about academic achievement but the way children think and approach social situations.

Writing in a post on the commission’s blog, he said: ‘It seems likely that worries about “not fitting in” will be one reason why highly able children from less well-off backgrounds are less likely to apply to the most selective universities.

‘It probably contributes to a lack of 
confidence amongst those who are upwardly mobile as they struggle to 
adapt to their new social environment with detrimental impact on their 
ability to reach their potential. 

‘And
 the lack of effective networks and advice to help navigate this new 
alien “middle class world” probably make it more difficult to translate 
high attainment into success in the professional jobs market.’

Education Secretary Michael Gove insist he is reforming the school system so that the opportunities that wealthy children have are more equally spread

He highlighted barriers to children from less well-off backgrounds being able to achieve their potential, including a lack of shared cultural experiences  such as watching plays and taking up hobbies, and a lack of ‘cultural reference points’.

The working classes also have different attitudes towards people and relationships’, including more ‘subtext, nuance and casualness’ in middle class relationships.

The working and middle class also enjoy different food, restaurants, and clothes, he said.

The middle classes are also able to draw on informal careers advice or role models, with working class children unable to tap into advice to break into the professional jobs market.

Mr Brant warned that the problem can be unappreciated by policy makers - who mostly come from middle class professional backgrounds.

‘This often means that debate can all too easily assume that if educational inequalities can be reduced and aspirations of young people from working class backgrounds raised then that alone will be enough to tackle the problem.’

The governmant has come under pressure to adress the problem of wokring class children struggling to break into top jobs.

Last year Sir John said he was appalled that 'every single sphere of British influence' was dominated by people who went to private school or who are from the 'affluent middle class'.

In response Education Secretary Mr Gove said he was 'reforming the school system so that the opportunities that wealthy children have are more equally spread'.

He once accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of being an intellectual socialist who collects ‘working class experiences as others might collect stamps’.
