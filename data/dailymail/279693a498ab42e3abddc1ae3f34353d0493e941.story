Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero scored one of the quickest Premier League goals by a substitute  against Liverpool on Monday night.

Aguero came off the substitutes' bench to score his side's third goal in their 3-1 win over Liverpool within just 23 seconds of being on the field.

The Argentine international has been left out of Manchester City's starting line-up for their first two Premier League games as he was given an extended summer break due to his country's progression to the World Cup final.

9. Sergio Aguero (Manchester City v Liverpool) 23 seconds 

However Aguero showed no signs of fatigue  at the Etihad Stadium by scoring in rapid time against Liverpool's Simon Mignolet.

Former Wigan Athletic striker Antoine Sibierski holds the record for the quickest Premier League goal by a substitute after scoring against Derby within 15 seconds of entering the field of play.

Then Wigan boss Steve Bruce decided to bring on Sibierski as he went in search for a late goal in the January 2008 fixture.

And his plan worked as the Frenchman made an instant impact by netting in record time.

Record holder: Then Wigan striker Antoine Sibierski scored after just 15 seconds against Derby County

Former Everton striker Apostolos Vellios's goal against Chelsea is currently joint second along with Andy Johnson's strike for Fulham after 17 seconds.

Yakubu's 79th minute header against Blackburn Rovers for Everton and Andre Bikey's goal against Chelsea also make the list - having scored after 18 and 19 seconds respectively.

Goals from Stelios Giannakopoulos, Shane Long and Matt Derbyshire also make the list.
