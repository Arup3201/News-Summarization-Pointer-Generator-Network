A Uniting Church has posted an ill-timed message on their board outside the church's property, offending members of the public and sparking online criticism.

Yeronga Uniting Church, in Brisbane, Queensland, posted the message 'Too blessed to be depressed' on their billboard, coinciding with the nationwide Mental Health Awareness Week.

The photo was posted by an outraged passerby onto Reddit, with the caption 'scumbag local church puts this up in time for Mental Health Week'.

Posters on the site quickly jumped to criticise the message.

One user wrote, 'Seriously? They are going to get a lot of complaints for that one... It is not ok to make those sorts of comments about mental illness. I know many religious people who wouldn't go back if their churches did something similar!'

Another Reddit member wrote, 'It's odd, I read the words, but all I got was..." I'm too delusional to be compassionate" . I'll just go with that, I think.'

Reverend Ross Mackay defended the church's actions, and said that the billboard message had been put up long before the start of Mental Health Week.

'It's a comment on us, not other people,' the Reverend said. 

 'We have people within our congregation who have mental health issues and we take them very seriously. We are very supportive of anyone who comes to church who may suffer from these issues and have initiatives in place to aid them.'

Many Reddit users echoed the sentiments of the Reverend, pointing out that while the sign may have offended some, it was probably posted with the best of intentions.

'I think their intention is: "It's mental health week. We aren't depressed and we attribute that to our faith with god. Maybe by stating this we can encourage people to join the church help them not be depressed",' wrote one user. 

Another Reddit member 'I'm guessing they just didn't think it through and unintentionally sent across the wrong message. If I remember correctly they [Yeronga Uniting Church] are usually pretty keen to answer any questions.'

Yeronga Uniting Church, in Brisbane, Queensland, posted the message 'Too blessed to be depressed' on their billboard, coinciding with the nationwide Mental Health Awareness Week.

Reverend Mackay said that the church was actively involved in the local community, and ran a 'men's shed' for men who struggled with loneliness, self worth and loss of personal value.

'We are a community oriented church trying to work within that community, and sometimes it won't understand our meaning when we post messages,' he said.

'No matter what we put up, someone will take it the wrong way.'

One Reddit user tried to explain the possible intention behind the message.

'As someone with a mental illness, I think they mean that if we work hard to research mental illness or understand it better through prayer or whatever, it won't be a problem anymore,' they said. 

Another commentator pointed out that in light of Mental Health Week it was important to remember that depression cut across all denominations and beliefs.

'Let us not forget that many Christians do struggle with long term depression...for many [it] takes a very long time to feel comforted and many of those find no comfort at all despite being fully committed Christians.'

One user attempted to make light of the situation, posting that 'There's only one thing rong with your post. It's Yeronga.' 

The Black Dog Institute research revealed that depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and that while 45% of Australians will experience mental health issues at some point in their life, every year 20% of Australians will suffer from mental illness including depression and anxiety.
