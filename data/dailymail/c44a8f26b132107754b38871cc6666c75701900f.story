A Texas mother is demanding her local school district removes a widespread ban on sunscreen, saying her daughter recently got severely burnt during a field trip and that skin cancer runs in her family.

The North East Independent School District in San Antonio imposed the restriction because it considers sunscreen toxic and fears students will eat it.

The policy applies to 72 schools in the area.

But according to parent Christy Riggs, its a rule that is completely unwarranted.

Not impressed: Christy Riggs, of San Antonio, says a district policy affecting 72 schools prohibiting sunscreen because it is 'toxic' caused her daughter to get severely burned on a recent field trip

'The reality is, children don't eat sunscreen and they're not going to,' Riggs told Fox News.

School district spokeswoman Aubrey Chancellor told the ABC they are trying to stop unnecessary allergic reactions.

'We don't want students sharing sunscreen,' she told the station.

'If students get it in their eyes or react badly to the sunscreen it can be quite serious.'

The district treats sunscreen as a medicine, Chancellor said, and requires a doctor's note to apply it at school.

But Mrs Riggs lost her father to skin cancer this year.

She said it was only six weeks between the time he was diagnosed and his death.

The ban is harmful to the children, she said.

Before school only: The North East Independent School District in San Antonio says if parents want to put sunscreen on their children, they can do it before school

'We want to teach our children to eat healthier, yet we have them outside and let them burn,' Riggs said.

'I'm not saying all children should be required to bring sunscreen,' Riggs said.

'But skin cancer is on the rise and reapplying at school shouldn't be an issue.'

Mrs Chancellor said the district have no qualms with parents applying sunscreen to their children before they go to school.

However Mrs Riggs hit back, saying if the students are outside or swimming they need to reapply every few hours.
