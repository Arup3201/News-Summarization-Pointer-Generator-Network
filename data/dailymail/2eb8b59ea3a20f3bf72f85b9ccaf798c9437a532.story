Change of plea: Sami Samir Hassoun will admit to dropping a backpack he thought held a bomb into a busy street's trash bin near Chicago Cubs' home ground Wrigley Field

A Lebanese immigrant will admit to dropping a backpack he thought held a bomb into a busy street's trash bin near Chicago Cubs' home ground Wrigley Field.

Sami Samir Hassoun, 23, also talked about poisoning Lake Michigan, bombing a landmark skyscraper and assassinating the then Mayor of Chicago.

He initially pleaded not guilty to charges that he received a fake bomb he believed was real from undercover FBI agents last year.

But attorneys have now told a federal judge he will plead guilty under an agreement worked out with prosecutors - a deal experts say may reflect the enormous odds he would face a trial.

At a hearing in Chicago, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman set a date of February 14 for Hassoun to change his plea.

But neither side offered details about exactly what charges he would plead guilty to, and government and defence attorneys declined to comment after the hearing.

Hassoun has a strong incentive to reduce his potential prison time via a plea deal.

A conviction on just one of the charges against him - attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction - carries a maximum life prison term.

Legal expert Karen Greenberg said suspects in terrorism cases have one overwhelming incentive to cut a plea agreement and to avoid taking the case to a jury: They almost never win at trial.

Greenberg, a director of the Centre on National Security at Fordham Law School in New York, said: 'And there's a very realistic chance of a very high sentence after trial. You just can't play around.'

According to her centre, out of 42 defendants charged with using or attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction since the September 11 attacks, there has been just one acquittal.

A total of 15 defendants have been convicted, five had the charge dropped and 21 of the cases are still pending.

Another expert said federal authorities also like to avoid a trial when possible, in part from fear that revelations in court could inspire copycats or inadvertently aid would-be terrorists honing their own plots.

Michael Fagel, a professor who teaches about homeland security at Northwestern University, said: 'Maybe the same methods can be used again or terrorists can learn from another guy's mistakes.'

Defence attorneys have described Hassoun as gullible and prone to wild boasts - but as having no links to extremists.

They also told reporters last year they would explore the possibility of using the trial defence that Hassoun was duped by federal agents.

A point of contention in recent filings was a defence request for the government to release the identity of an informant who tipped off authorities about Hassoun.

That informant befriended Hassoun while at least two FBI undercover agents also got in touch, posing as co-plotters.

The defence claimed the informant would have been a key figure at trial because they allege he at one point threatened Hassoun not to back out of the plot.

Prosecutors say there is no evidence of any such threat and that identifying the confidential source would open him up to reprisals.

While the pressure to cut a plea deal is heaviest on the defence, Greenberg said prosecutors often do not want to see their investigations subject to scrutiny.

She said legitimate questions have been raised in this and other cases about whether there was some element of entrapment by federal agents.

The jailed Hassoun, a one-time bakery worker, did not appear at Tuesday's hearing. He has shown up at earlier hearings - occasionally lifting his shackled hands to blow kisses to his mother on a spectators' bench.

According to prosecutors, Hassoun waffled about his plans, allegedly talking about profiting monetarily and another time broaching the idea of poisoning Lake Michigan or assassinating then-Chicago Mayor Richard M Daley.

While it was harmless, prosecutors have said the device planted by Hassoun near Wrigley Field appeared ominous - a paint can fitted with blasting caps and a timer.

Hassoun was deadly serious about the plot and it was 'not a matter of talk or bravado', prosecutor Joel Hammerman told a judge shortly after Hassoun's arrest last year.
