The new fiancé of Formula 1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone was exposed as a cocaine dealer - before being banned from the city for insider trading

Former stockbroker Jay Rutland proposed to the statuesque brunette in Dubai after a whirlwind romance.

However, Rutland, 31, was caught up in a sting by a Sunday newspaper in April 2002, where he sold cocaine to an undercover reporter at an Essex pub.

He was also seen having a string of brief meetings with EastEnders star Jessie Wallace, who would drive to the Royal Oak in Loughton, Essex, only to meet Rutland in the car park before driving off again.

New love: Jay proposed to Tamara after a quick romance

At the time, Jessie – who had just 
joined the flagship BBC1 soap as Kat Slater - denied buying drugs from 
Rutland, telling the Sunday Mirror: ‘He’s my ex-boyfriend’s nephew,  I 
know his family, I've known him for years. I don't know what he does.

‘I did not know about this. I've never bought drugs off him.’

The Sunday newspaper took the package 
Rutland – then 21 - sold to a reporter to a laboratory where it was 
confirmed to be cocaine, and when asked to comment, Rutland said: ‘I 
won’t confirm or deny anything.’

 'Tamara just wants to be in love - just like anyone else. She wants to be happy and she believes in giving people a second chance'

Today, a source close to Tamara, 28, 
told MailOnline that she was aware of the incident, saying: ‘Tamara just
wants to be in love – just like anyone else. She wants to be happy and 
she believes in giving people a second chance.’

Rutland, who went to Chigwell School, 
was sacked from his job at Deutsche Bank the morning after the cocaine 
dealing report was published.

The long-haired Essex boy had a 
temporary job in the firm's Corporate Trust section at their Liverpool 
Street offices – but he was sacked 25 minutes after he arrived at work 
the following Monday morning.

And there was more trouble for 
Rutland, who was last year banned from working in the City for trading 
without ‘honesty and integrity’.

Banned: Last
year Mr Rutland was banned by the Financial Services Authority, which 
found he used inside information to boost sales of shares, and 'watered 
down' warnings about the risks to investors

Exes: Tamara Ecclestone was engaged to Omar Khyami before their split last year

The Financial Services Authority found
he used inside information to boost sales of shares - and ‘watered 
down’ warnings about the risks to investors.

The FSA probed Mr Rutland’s sales 
methods when he worked for now defunct City trading  firm Pacific 
Continental Securities in 2007.

The regulator then ruled he ‘is not a 
fit and proper person [to be trading in the City] as his conduct 
demonstrates a lack of honesty and integrity’.

They imposed a £160,000 fine but 
reduced it to £30,000 after hearing of ‘Mr Rutland’s financial 
circumstances including a debilitating illness affecting his ability to 
work’ – but gave no further details.

Rutland proposed during a romantic 
holiday in Dubai following a whirlwind romance – and Miss Ecclestone has
since been seen wearing a silver band on her ring finger.

Friends say he has come clean about his past with his new fiancee, whom he plans to marry as early as next year.

A friend said: ‘Tamara knows all about Jay’s background.

Jay has been honest from the start. This all happened a long time ago.’

Blackmail: Tamara Ecclestone leaves Southwark Crown Court in London today after an ex-boyfriend tried to bribe her

Their sudden engagement comes seven 
months after Ecclestone split from businessman Omar Khyami, 41, after he
was caught on a sex tape.

Speaking about the split, Tamara told 
MailOnline in October: In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Tamara
said: 'I’m feeling really good right now, it was a really horrible time
and it was really, really hard. Sometimes I don’t think you realise how
strong you are until you get put in that sort of situation.

'As cheesy as it sounds, I think 
everything happens for a reason. My dad said to me recently, “Tamara, 
you had a lucky escape. You weren’t married, you didn’t have children. 
There’s a bigger, better plan out there for you.” That’s kind of how I’m
looking at things now.'

Despite the explosive way the relationship ended, the brunette beauty said she doesn't regret the long-term romance at all.

She added: 'I did have a lucky escape.
Definitely. I don’t regret the relationship, I think I’m the kind of 
person who wants to fix people sometimes, and that’s not really a 
healthy way to be. People have to want to change for themselves.

Family friends: EastEnders star Jessie Wallace denied buying drugs from Jay Rutland following a Sunday paper sting in 2002

The reality star and model is set to 
inherite her Formula One mogul father's £2.6 billion fortune, but she 
insisted her fame and fortune are not important to her.

Tamara explained: 'All the things that
are really important, like health and true love, money can’t buy. 
Obviously, I realise I have a privileged life and don’t have the same 
worries other people. Once someone betrays you it’s very difficult. 
Where you’re from or money isn’t relevant at that time.'

And the star is still is a big 
believer in fairytale romance after seeing how happy her younger sister 
Petra, 23, is expecting her first baby with her husband James Stunt.

She told MailOnline: 'I look at them 
and think it’s really nice to believe in happy ever after. They’re so 
good for each other and they bring out the absolute best in each other. 
I’m really happy for her.

'She’s a very settled person for her 
age, and she’s so happy. It makes me glad to think there’s a James-type 
character out there for everyone. They’re a really lovely couple.'

The heiress today appeared at Southwark Crown Court after an ex-boyfriend tried to blackmail her out of £200,000 by threatening to sell her 'intimate secrets' to the tabloid press.

Derek Rose, 33, of Camden, London, allegedly teamed up with Birmingham media studies student Jakir Uddin, 20, to email the bullying demands to the wealthy star's agent, Dana Malmstrom.

Rose dated Tamara when she was 17, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
