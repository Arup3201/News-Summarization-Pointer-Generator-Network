Neil Lennon is a leading contender for the Cardiff City managerial vacancy after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's eight-month reign was brought to an end on Thursday and three potential candidates ruled themselves out.

A source close to the former Celtic manager, who is currently without a job, told Sportsmail that Lennon is keen to discuss the position, with the Welsh club looking to make a quick appointment in the wake of Solskjaer's departure. A senior club source confirmed Lennon is under consideration. 

Lennon is known to have admirers at Cardiff, who have handed caretaker control to player-coach Danny Gabbidon and academy coach Scott Young for this weekend's trip to Derby.

Cardiff owner Vincent Tan instructed chairman Mehmet Dalman to hold exit talks with the Norwegian

Vincent Tan has already been informed by Dundee that Paul Hartley is keen to stay in Scotland, while Tony Pulis would prefer to take his next job in the Premier League and Craig Bellamy said he would not be ready for management another two years.

Bellamy also revealed on BT Sport 2 that he turned down the chance to manage Cardiff after Malky Mackay was sacked last year. He said: 'I had the opportunity at Christmas to do it - when Malky left they offered it to me then. I didn’t really give them the chance to get into a conversation.

'I’m not right for the club at this present moment. They need to go a different direction and the club’s not right for me at this present moment.'

Cardiff want to appoint Dundee manager Paul Hartley as the new boss, but the Scottish club are resisting 

Solskjaer's team lost 1-0 to Middlesbrough on Tuesday night as their poor run of form continued 

It was ultimately Cardiff's lowly position of 17th in the Championship that caused Solskjaer's exit, though the 41-year-old claimed 'differences (with Tan) in philosophy on how to manage' was decisive in him leaving, albeit on amicable terms.

Solskjaer said: 'He (Vincent) has my full respect and I really wish him all the best in his pursuit of making this football club successful.

'However, our difference in philosophy on how to manage the club made me decide to step aside and allow the club to move forward in the direction Vincent wants.'

Tan said: 'Ole was hired by Cardiff City on our understanding and belief that he would help us fight relegation from the Barclays Premier League. Unfortunately that did not happen.

'After the club was relegated many people advised me to let him go, but I decided to keep Ole on for the Championship season. Regrettably our recent results do not justify Ole’s continued role as manager at Cardiff.

'Ole has therefore decided to step down and I have accepted this. During my short association with Ole, I have found him to be an honest and hard-working professional, but unfortunately the football results were not in his favour.'

This weekend's trip to Derby will be overseen by player-coach Danny Gabbidon and academy coach Scott Young.
