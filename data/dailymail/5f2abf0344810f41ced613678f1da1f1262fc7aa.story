Ten football fans have been arrested following an outburst of violence in the Millwall supporters' area after the south London club lost their FA Cup semi final against Wigan at Wembley.

Fights erupted among the Lions supporters, leaving some fans with bloodied noses and younger ones weeping as they watched fans and officers clash.

Supporters were filmed rushing at police, and one man was seen appearing to hide an officer's hat underneath his coat and walk away from the row laughing.

Bad end: Many fans looked horrified as rows erupted in the stands after the disappointing match for Millwall

Fans could be seen pushing and shoving each other and the FA has threatened to bring criminal charges against those involved in the 'violence and disorder'.

Violence escalated after Wigan scored their winning goal, with television pictures showing police heavily outnumbered and defending themselves with batons.

Those not involved let their embarrassment show as they booed the few who spoiled what was supposed to be a magical day out for the Championship club.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Ten people have been arrested following sporadic disorder among fans in the Millwall supporters' area at Wembley.

'Investigations into the circumstances of the incidents are continuing.'

Dave Whelan, chairman of Wigan, who won 
the match 2-0, told BBC Radio Five: 'I can't understand why the Millwall
fans would fight each other.

It was a miserable end to the match, and many younger supporters were left crying as they watched the frightening clashes

'I understand if they want to fall out with the visiting team, but why would they fall out amongst themselves?

'It just gives football a very, very poor reputation.'

Alex Horne, General Secretary of The FA, said: 'The Metropolitan Police and The FA are this evening investigating scenes of sporadic violence and disorder in the Millwall FC end at today's FA Cup Semi-Final.

'The FA and Wembley Stadium will work with police and representatives of Millwall FC to review all events.

'We will look to ensure those involved are identified and we would call for criminal charges and a football banning order to be brought against them.

'The FA deplore the scenes which have taken place, which are unacceptable.

'Everything will be done to take action against those involved.'

Tensions mount as Portsmouth fans try to invade the pitch at the final whistle during the League One game between Brentford and Portsmouth at Griffin Park

Portsmouth manager Guy Whittingham insisted the fans were merely celebrating after the ownership of the club had been secured by a fans-run group

In other scenes of chaos, Portsmouth fans ran on to the pitch in Brentford today following a match.

Hundreds of visiting supporters ran onto the pitch after the final whistle and there were scuffles with police and stewards at Griffin Park.

But Portsmouth manager Guy  Whittingham insisted the fans were merely celebrating after the ownership of the club had been secured by a fans-run group after a long period in administration.

'No-one wants to see that happen but it is not done in a violent way,' he told westlondonsport.com.

'It is done because they are celebrating the club and I hope people appreciate that, because it's about the euphoria surrounding things at Portsmouth at the moment.

'The situation at the club has not been going on for the last 13 or 14 months, it's been happening for four years, and unfortunately things spilled onto pitch at the end.'

Struggling Portsmouth fell to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford after Clayton Donaldson struck with just four minutes remaining.
