Scotland is poised to reject independence – but only based on the votes of half a million English living north of the border.

Scottish-born voters are evenly split, 48 per cent to 48 per cent, with just six days to go before next week’s historic referendum, according to a poll published last night.

But after the 477,000 voters born in England are taken into account - as well as tens of thousands of Welsh, Northern Irish and foreigners entitled to take part on Thursday - the ‘No’ to independence campaign enjoys a four point lead.

Scottish-born voters are evenly split on whether to leave the United Kingdom - but those born elsewhere are strongly pro-Union

Unionists however will point to the 750,000 Scots living in England, many of whom are strongly anti-independence, that cannot vote next week.

Overall, some 63 per cent of English, Welsh and Northern Irish voters living in Scotland are planning to reject independence, according to last night’s YouGov survey. 

Just 27 per cent of non-Scottish Brits plan to vote for independence and only a third of those born outside the UK.

More than half of foreign immigrants living in Scotland plan to against separation.

Last night’s YouGov poll for the Times and Sun newspapers suggested that many were turned off independence by Alex Salmond.

Mr Salmond is overwhelmingly mistrusted by those born outside Scotland. According to the YouGov research, three quarters of Brits living in north of the border but born outside Scotland do not trust the Scottish First Minister.

Two thirds of those not born in the UK do not trust Mr Salmond. This is compared to 55 per cent of Scotish-born voters who distrust the SNP leader.

Even David Cameron – considered by many to be toxic in Scotland - is more trusted by non-Scots than Mr Salmond.

The Prime Minister is trusted by a third of ‘foreigners’ living in Scotland – 10 per cent more than Mr Salmond.

Some 65 per cent of those born in the UK but outside Scotland also said they would be financially worse off after independence. Six in 10 foreign-born immigrants shared the same pessimism.

Scots themselves are much more evenly split on the issue of whether they would be hit economically by separation. Four in 10 say they would be better off – just five per cent less than the proportion who claim they would be hit in the pocket.

A surge in support for independence saw support for a 'Yes' vote briefly taking the lead last week, before falling back yesterday

Mr Salmond’s failure to attract those born outside of Scotland could cost him the referendum, because of the relatively large proportion of people living in the country born elsewhere.

The Scottish population is around 5.3million – but 17 per cent were born elsewhere.

Nine per cent of the Scottish population were born in England – some 477,000. A further 0.7 per cent came from Northern Ireland and 0.3 per cent in Wales.

Of the seven per cent - 369,000 - people in Scotland who were not born in the UK, 15 per cent - 55,000 - were born in Poland, and six per cent - 23,000 - were born in each of India and the Republic of Ireland.

Rutherglen and Hamilton West Labour MP Tom Greatrex, who was born and grew up in Kent, urged the SNP to accept the result of the referendum – even if it was English votes which blocked independence.

Mr Greatrex said: ‘All of these polls suggest it’s going to be quite close, so there are various possible scenarios once the numbers are broken down.

‘Just because someone happens to have been born in a different part of the UK, like me, they are just entitled to have their say as people who happened to have been born in Scotland.

‘I don’t think it will take anything away from a no vote – it will be the view of the people living in Scotland.’

But Mr Greatrix said he had experienced a rise in anti-English sentiment over the past few months.

He said: ‘I’ve lived here for 11 years and it’s just been a handful of occasions when people have had a go at me – but most of those have been in the last couple of months.’ He added: ‘The atmosphere is quite fevered.’
