Two young drivers who killed a grandmother while racing their cars in a suburban street should expect lengthy jail terms, a judge has said.

Mary Byrne, 51, was in a minicab outside her home when it was hit by a car driven by Joseph Robinson, who was racing his friend Thomas Healey.

A court has heard the taxi carrying Mrs Byrne was pulling onto the driveway of her house in Bradford, West Yorkshire in April last year when it was hit by a BMW.

Mrs Byrne 
was thrown through the window of the taxi, which then struck her as it 
spun around from the impact. She died later that afternoon.

BMW driver Robinson, 22, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving after initially denying the charge.

Healey,
 21, who the court heard briefly stopped his Ford Focus before fleeing, 
was found guilty of the same offence this week following a trial at 
Bradford Crown Court.

The court heard his Ford was able to slow down and avoid striking the vehicles.

Prosecutor
 Tim Capstick said: 'What [Healey] did was to see what had occurred in 
front of his eyes, and having witnessed this road traffic collision this
 defendant was to simply turn his vehicle round and drive away from the 
scene.'

The court heard the two vehicles were seen travelling at speeds of between 70 and 80mph before the crash.

Witnesses said at one point they veered onto the wrong side of the road, and at another, the BMW nearly lost control.

The
 Ford was so close behind the other car it was almost touching its rear 
bumper, and another driver had to brake to avoid a collision, the court 
heard.

Mr
 Capstick said Healey attended a police station after the crash and told officers the BMW had overtaken him 'driving like an idiot'.

Healey
 said he was trying to catch up with the car to get the registration 
number when he witnessed the accident and panicked and drove off.

But Mr Capstick said witnesses had told how the Ford had been in front of the BMW some of the time.

It took the jury of six men and six women only one hour to reach its unanimous verdict.

Healey,
 of Bradford, gave no reaction to the jury's decision, but there were 
cheers from members of Mrs Byrne's family, who sat in the public 
gallery.

Healey has been bailed until his sentencing date is fixed and he was immediately disqualified from driving. Robinson, also of Bradford, will be sentenced at the same time.

It emerged during a hearing this week that Robinson was already on bail for an offence of aggravated vehicle taking involving his father's car at the time of the crash.

After
 the jury's verdict, Judge John Potter told Healey: 'You can expect a 
significant custodial sentence and you have to be prepared for that.'

Outside the court, Mrs Byrne's family spoke of their ordeal in the 14 months since her death.

In a statement, they family said: 'Lads of this age should not be able to drive high-powered cars like those. It was only going to be a matter of time before they killed someone.

'They drove for 2.1 miles before the 
crash, that was a big game of Russian roulette they played with a lot of
 people's lives that day.

'They have been in the community, living their lives every day while we have been grieving for mum and not being able to grieve for her properly because of knowing the only people suffering over this were us.'

In the months before the trial, her family 
have been raising money for the road safety charity Brake and now hope 
to help others who suffer as a result of 
dangerous driving.
