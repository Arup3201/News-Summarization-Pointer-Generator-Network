Ukranian model Valeria Lukyanova, who lives her life as a 'human Barbie' has revealed she doesn't consume food or water anymore.

Some have said she uses plastic surgery and Photoshop to create her doll-like image, but her impossibly thin waist could actually be down to not eating for weeks.

The model, 23, has said she is now converting to 'Breatharianism' - training herself to live off only light and air.

Minute! Valeria had indicated that her tiny waist was a genetic gift from mom, saying, 'My motherÂ¿s waist is as narrow as mine - I inherited that from her'

'In recent weeks I have not been 
hungry at all; I'm hoping it's the final stage before I can subsist on 
air and light alone,' she has said.

The model and singer's new vice, 
Breatharianism, is a cult that believes food - and possibly water - are not necessary.

A breatharian is said to be someone who never 
eats or drinks as they can exist on 'cosmic micro-food', according to 
the International Business Times.

The practice is criticised as potentially
 lethal pseudoscience, and several practitioners have reportedly died of
 starvation. None have submitted themselves for comprehensive medical 
testing.

With her pinched waist, skeletal arms,
 enormous coloured contact lenses, thick make-up and vacant expression, 
Valeria believes she has become a living, breathing Barbie - something 
she sees as the ultimate embodiment of perfection.

All genes? The model, spiritual teacher and self-professed 'alien' says she has never had plastic surgery, except for a breast augmentation

She
 has courted international controversy by turning herself into a human 
doll, confessing she wishes to be considered 'the most perfect woman on 
the internet'. Based on the photos on her social media accounts, Valeria is sporting an increasingly thin frame.

This is not the first time that Valeria declared something unusual.

She has said that she is a spiritual teacher and can speak with 
aliens through light, she thinks that has the ability to time travel and has had out-of-body experiences.

A VICE filmmaker travelled to Ukraine last summer to meet her. Valeria agreed to a documentary which focused on her spiritual and astral 
theories, and her views on pre-Earth space.

She revealed she 
believes she is from another planet - possibly Venus, but she isn't 
quite sure - but is adamant she isn't human. Valeria revealed has visited a psychiatrist about the voices in her head.

While she says she has become the object of 
hatred within some internet communities, away from YouTube and Tumblr, Valeria works in new age opera, while being supported by her construction-working husband who also acts as her manager.
