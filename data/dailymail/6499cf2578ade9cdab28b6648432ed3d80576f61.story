Married school caretaker Joseph Hart tried to order a 12-year-old girl from a notorious paedophile for £100 an hour by text but has been spared jail

A married school caretaker who tried to order a 12-year-old girl by text from a notorious paedophile for £100 an hour  has been spared jail.

Father-of-three Joseph Hart contacted Darren Leggett via a website when police intercepted their messages and raided Hart's home in Horwich, Bolton.

He was negotiating by text message for the girl to be sent to him and the deal was at an early stage, Bolton Crown Court heard.

Hart, 32, was convicted of arranging a child sex offence, but spared an immediate jail term. He was given a two-year suspended sentence. 

He was immediately suspended from his job at Chorley New Road Primary School - and has now been banned from working with children.

His former employer Bolton Council stressed that none of the charges related to his employment or place of work.

Officers found 61 indecent images of children on his computer when he was arrested, the court heard.

The caretaker, who has Asperger's syndrome and an obsessive compulsive personality, initially claimed he was trying to trap paedophile Leggett.

But a jury rejected this and found him guilty of arranging a child sex offence.

He admitted six further counts relating to the indecent images before his trial in November.

Sentencing him to a suspended two-year prison term yesterday Judge Elliot Knopf said Hart's case was 'unique' and that the deal was in its 'early stages'. 

He also said the defendant did not understand the 'outcome of his actions'.

Hart made contact with Leggett by text on February 6, 2012 after finding him on a website.

But Kent Police arrested Leggett on February 10, seizing a phone which was found to contain texts sent between February 6 and 9.

Hart, of  Horwich, was arrested in May the same year and was subsequently suspended by Bolton Council.

Hart arrived at court expecting to be jailed and had a suitcase with him in the dock.

Vanessa Thompson, defending, said Hart had been married with three children, but that he had split from his wife since the case came to light.

She said: 'He is never going to work for the council again and never will he work in the capacity he was before.'

Judge Knopf said: 'Your case is different and complex and in many respects unique.

'You are someone who suffers from Asperger's and the result of it would appear to be an obsessive compulsive personality, and you do not understand the outcome of your actions.

'It is an explanation as to how you came to be involved in all of this.

'The arrangement with Leggett was very much in embryonic form. No venue had been agreed for what was to happen. Very little had been discussed.

'Once Leggett was out of the way there is no evidence that you tried to pursue enquiries with anyone else.'

A council spokesman said: 'We can confirm that Mr Hart was immediately suspended from duty as soon as he was arrested and no longer works for the council. None of the charges related to his employment or place of work.'

Hart was given a prison sentence of two years, suspended for the same period, for arranging a child sex offence.

He was given a concurrent nine-month sentence for the six charges of making indecent images.

The former caretaker was placed on the sex offenders' register for 10 years and given a five-year sexual offences prevention order.

Leggett, a convicted paedophile from Kent, was jailed indefinitely in June, 2012, for 31 counts of child sex abuse.

He raped his three victims - all aged under 13 - then made 36 harrowing films of the sickening abuse for others to see.

The paedophile's six-year campaign of abuse saw him create his own websites from his parents' house, which itself was just a short walk from a local primary school. 

The sex offender was jailed indefinitely, although his tariff will be a minimum of seven years.

Maidstone Crown Court heard the quiet supermarket employee first came across the youngsters in the aisles of the store where he worked, then later gained access to the children.

Leggett’s six-year campaign of abuse was only uncovered when a boy he abused told a teacher what had been happening to him.
