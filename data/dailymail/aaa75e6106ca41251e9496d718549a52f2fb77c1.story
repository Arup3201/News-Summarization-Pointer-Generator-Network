Police in northwest Indiana say they may have just caught a prolific serial killer who murdered at least four women across Chicagoland.

A 43-year-old Gary man confessed to killing a woman whose body was found in a Motel 6. He told investigators where the bodies of three more women could be found.

Cops found the three bodies at different locations in Gary late Saturday and early Sunday, following up on information the 43-year-old man provided during questioning, Hammond police Lieutenant Rich Hoyda said.

The badly-decomposed bodies were found inside three abandoned homes.

Victim Afrika Hardy, 19, was found at this Motel 6 in Hammond, Indiana

Anith Jones, 35, was identified by relatives as one of the victims. It is unclear how she met the killer

The man, who has not been identified pending charges, may have killed many more victims over several years, WGN reported. 

His latest victim — 19-year-old Afrika Hardy, who was strangled — may have been prostitute he met on the Craigslist-like website Backpage.com, according to the station.

He is reported to have acted alone in killing 'many others' in Indiana and Illinois, according to WGN.

The Lake County coroner's office said second victim had been identified by family members as 35-year-old Anith Jones of Merrillville. Cops were led to the bodies of two other women.

Autopsies had not yet been completed on her or the other two women, who have not yet been identified. 

The Post-Tribune of Merrillville reported Jones had been missing since Oct. 8 and Gary police had searched a block recently looking for her.

Police discovered Hardy's body about 9:30pm Friday at a Motel 6.

'A friend of the deceased called us and she was concerned when she didn't respond to her calling,' Hoyda said. 'We were sent there and found that person dead.'

Police investigating her death obtained a search warrant for a home and vehicle in Gary. 

Police conducted a search late Saturday afternoon and took the man into custody.

Hoyda said the man confessed during questioning and then told police 'where several other female victims of possible homicide were located.'

Hoyda wouldn't comment on how the man knew the women, on a possible motive or on whether the man confessed to killing any of the other three women.

Gary police Cpl. Gabrielle King said police received information that there were bodies in three different locations in Gary.

Those locations were within a four-mile radius. The motel in Hammond where the other body was found is about six miles west.

Hoyda said the man's name is not being released because he has not been charged. He would not say when charges will be filed. He is being held in the Hammond City Jail.

The killer led police to several abandoned home in Gary where they found the bodies of three other victims
