The post-Super Bowl press conference was temporarily interrupted when a crazed fan seized the microphone to deliver a bizarre rant about the 9/11 terrorist attack.

The man stormed the stage where Most Valuable Player Malcom Smith was fielding questions about the game to claim the U.S. government was behind the strikes on the Twin Towers in New York in 2001.

He shouted: 'Investigate 9/11 ... 9/11 was perpetrated by people in our own government.'

It was a bizarre event on a victorious day for Seattle Seahawks fans who celebrated a dominant triumph in the Super Bowl - the city's first major sports championship in more than 30 years.

As the team beat Denver Broncos 43-8, a swarm of fans who had been watching it in the West Coast city swarmed across the city, clambering on buildings and pounding on passing cars.

The city quickly descended into chaos as 3,000 revelers swamped the city, climbing on buildings, smashing glass and ripped down street signs.

Anticipating rowdy celebrations, the 
city's police had earlier tweeted a warning that they would be 'making 
sure everyone is celebrating safely'.

Police dressed in riot gear were patrolling the streets, with an anticipated 3,000 fans expected to party all night.

In
 downtown Seattle there were reports of people dancing on top of cars 
and the News Tribune reported hearing bangs, but said it couldn't tell 
if it was fireworks or celebratory gunfire.

Some revelers dismantled street signs around Pioneer Square and burned a Broncos hat as the riotous celebrations continued.

The
 city's historic pergola, a glass-roofed structure built in 1909, was 
feared damaged after hordes started clambering over the fragile 
building, and smashing its roof, Kiro7 News reported.

By the early hours of Monday, only one arrest had been reported, after a fan fired celebratory gunfire in his yard.

was impounded after neighbors complained in Bellingham.

In
 New York, where several blocks around Times Square have been hosting 
Super Bowl events, the Empire State building glowed green, and fans in 
the team's colors partied in the street.

The last time a major Seattle sports franchise won a championship was in 1979 when the Supersonics took the NBA title.

'The
 12th Man are very vocal, very passionate fans, but they don't get out 
of control. And we don't expect that to change, but we are prepared and 
we do have a plan,' Seattle police spokesman Mark Jamieson said.

Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement that an official Seahawks victory parade would happen at 11am Wednesday.
