A 12-year-old schoolboy suffered horrific injuries from a savage dog attack before being saved by a hero neighbour, who fought off the vicious animal with a metal tube from a vacuum cleaner.

Louis Currie, 12, of Droylsden, Greater Manchester, could have died in the attack by the pit-bull type dog but for the bravery of Stewart McGuinness, 45, a mini-sweeper driver for Salford City Council.

The animal sprang from a garden as Louis rode his scooter to a friend's house - tearing a chunk out of his leg and sinking its teeth into his arms and face. The boy was left in shock and bleeding heavily.

But he was helped to safety and the emergency services were called. Louis is now recovering at Saint Mary's Hospital in Manchester but could have lifelong scars and may need plastic surgery.

His mother Sarah, who lives with Louis and his older sister Megan, 16, said: ‘Louis tried to climb onto cars and a van, but the dog wouldn't stop. Stewart got a Hoover pole and battered the dog.

‘In my eyes, he saved my son's life. Louis was very lucky. In most places the dog's teeth didn't go through major arteries or tendons - but there's muscle damage that needs to be fixed.’

Mr McGuinness said: ‘My partner Julie and I were sat watching the television when we heard a young child screaming outside. Julie looked out of the window and saw the lad being attacked by the dog.

‘It was on top of him, biting him. My automatic reaction was to grab the first thing that came to hand, which happened to be the vacuum extension. I tried to force the dog off the lad.

‘But he had him by the leg. It was vicious. It wasn't the nicest thing having to whack the dog with the pole, but I had no choice - it would have killed him otherwise.

‘Eventually I got the dog off and threw it over a fence into another garden. We locked all the gates, but we were still worried it would jump over the fence. It was a horrible dog - all muscle.

‘It was just so powerful that when I was hitting it with the pole, there was no reaction. It bit so far into the lad's leg that it was near impossible to get it off.

‘The lad and the dog were covered in blood, it was horrific. My only concern was saving the boy - I didn't think about myself, it was just automatic.’

Mr McGuinness’s partner, Julie Lydon, 47, rang an ambulance. She said the incident lasted for up to 15 minutes and added: ‘We just hope he's okay - his injuries were awful.’

Police are investigating the attack on Sunday afternoon on Louis, a Manchester City F.C. fan who attends Droylsden Academy. It is thought the dog was captured - but it is not yet known if it has been destroyed. No arrests have been made.
