The family of a man who died in 2010 believe he too may have been the victim of the the South West Water poisoning scandal.

Campaigners have called for a fresh probe into Britain’s worst ever mass tapwater poisoning incident after it has been linked to the death of Richard Gibbons.

Drinking supplies were polluted when tonnes of aluminium sulphate were tipped into the wrong tank at the Lowermoor treatment works in Camelford, Cornwall in July 1988.

Last year an inquest ruled that Carole Cross (pictured when younger) possessed abnormal levels of the metal aluminium in her brain when she died aged aged 59

Last year a coroner said it may have contributed to the death of Carole Cross, 59, who died in 2004.

Carole suffered with a rare neurological disease and was found with high levels of aluminium in her brain.

Now the family Mr Gibbons say new tests have shown that he had similarly high levels of aluminium sulphate in his brain when he died aged 60 in 2010.

They said initial tests were inconclusive but a second set has proved that he had similar levels of aluminium as Ms Cross.

Mr Gibbon’s son-in-law Phil Reed said: 'After his death we asked for tests to be performed to establish if there was any evidence of aluminium accumulation in his brain tissue.'

'Initial tests were performed, which proved to be inconclusive for aluminium.

'Unfortunately these tests were performed on small samples of tissue rather than the whole brain.

'We requested that the test be re-run but using the whole brain to establish if there was any accumulation.

'After the second test it turns out that Richard’s brain did indeed have high levels of aluminium particularly in the hippocampus, the area of the brain responsible for short term memory.

'The two people tested for brain aluminium levels, Carole Cross and now Richard Gibbons, have shown high levels of aluminium in their brain tissue.

'This evidence shows the need for further study amongst the population exposed in July 1988.'

The poisoning occurred when a relief delivery driver inadvertently dumped 20 tons of aluminium sulphate directly into the unmanned treatment works.

The alumininium sulphate was then pumped into the water system to South West Water Authority's customers. There were widespread complaints of stomach cramps, ulcers aching joints and even hair turning green.

The incident polluted the supply to 20,000 people but authorities insisted it was safe and even suggested the 'foul' taste could be disguised by mixing it with orange juice.

Locals quickly began reporting stomach cramps, rashes, diarrhoea, mouth ulcers and aching joints - some even complained that their hair turned green.

Mr Gibbons, of Tintagel, Cornwall, later complained of short-term memory loss, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and kidney damage.

He also suffered with decaying finger and toe nails, skin problems and recurring gum and ear infections, which he believed were linked to the contaminated water.

A recent study by the Government-appointed Lowermoor Sub Group of the Committee on Toxicity said there was 'no conclusive link' between the leak and the chronic symptoms and diseases reported.

But it called for further research to examine the long-term neurological effects on young childrenand babies born in the immediate aftermath.
