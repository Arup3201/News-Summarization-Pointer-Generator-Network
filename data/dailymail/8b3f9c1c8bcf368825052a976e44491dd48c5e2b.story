A New York businessman and his wife have been revealed as the new owners of Billy Connolly's Scottish mansion.

Marc Lino and his Scottish wife Lynne bought Candacraig House in Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, and its surrounding estate from the Big Yin and his wife Pamela Stephenson for almost £3million.

The new owners welcomed locals into their home at the weekend to celebrate the traditional Lonach Gathering and Games.

Both of them also donned traditional Highland dress at a welcoming party for staff at the house.

Mr Lino, 41, is a financier from New York who currently works in Amsterdam for management consultant firm Bain & Company.

He married his wife, who is originally from Peterhead, in 2004 and they have two young children.

Mr Lino is the co-founder of trendy Manhattan eaterie Billy's Bakery and the couple are a fixture on the New York social scene.

It is thought they plan to use the house as a retreat and also rent it out for functions and weddings.

The 12-bedroom Baronial property is set in 14 acres of grounds and includes a walled garden and a croquet lawn.

Mrs Lino, 44, has set up a company called Candacraig Enterprises and a new website for the property is set to launch soon.

Mr Lino founded Billy's Bakery with a friend from business school in 2003 and it now has three stores in New York.

A profile of Mr Lino on his company's website reads: 'Marc has more than 15 years of experience in consulting and has worked with clients in the US, Europe and Asia across a variety of industries, with a focus on Financial Services and Technology.

'He has teamed with clients to address a wide array of business issues relating to strategy, full potential and enterprise transformation (including IT).

'Prior to moving to Amsterdam, Marc was a partner in Bain's New York Office.'

Mr Connolly, 71, bought Candacraig House from Body Shop founder Anita Roddick for £590,000 in 1998.

He then spent an additional £500,000 buying up the neighbouring properties in order to ensure greater privacy.

During his time at the house, the comedian entertained celebrity friends there including Steve Martin, Dame Judi Dench and the late Robin Williams.

At the time it went on sale last year, Jamie Macnab, of selling agents Savills, said: 'It is absolutely gorgeous, in the most stunning position and money has been lavished on it over the years.'

Mr Connolly now spends most of his time at his apartment in New York but recently said he was considering moving to the south coast of England.

He said: 'I've been a moving target for a long, long time. It suits me lovely, but recently I've been thinking about moving back to Britain.

'I don't know why but it's been calling on me. I just feel this tug, it keeps coming into my mind. I thought about Brighton a lot.'

It is understood the comic and his wife kept a cottage in the grounds of Candacraig as part of the sale.

The Linos were unavailable for comment.
