A president of a company that owns a North Carolina motel where three guests were killed by carbon monoxide gas that seeped 
into their room is facing felony charges.

Damon Mallatere was indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday and faces three counts of involuntary manslaughter and assault inflicting seriously bodily injury following the deaths at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza in Boone.

Mallatere's company owns the motel, which is part of an international franchise, where police say a faulty swimming pool heater allowed 
carbon monoxide to seep into the motel room through a corroded pipe.

Damon Mallatere was indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday and faces three counts of involuntary manslaughter after three people died of carbon monoxide poisoning at a North Carolina hotel he owned

Poisoned by carbon monoxide: Jeffrey Williams, 11, was found dead in room 225 of the Best Western Hotel because of a faulty pool water heater in June

Daryl and Shirley Jenkins from Washington state died on
 April 16, but delays in investigating the cause led to 11-year-old 
Jeffrey Williams' death in the same room in June. The South Carolina boy's mother Jeannie was seriously injured.

Prosecutor 
Britt Springer says Mallatere, 50, faces three counts of involuntary 
manslaughter and assault inflicting serious bodily injury.

Mallatere’s attorney told the Charlotte Observer that he was 'extremely disappointed' that charges have been pressed against him instead of the gas company that converted the heater from propane to natural gas.

A message left at a telephone number listed for Mallatere wasn't returned.

It was revealed in November that a
 medical examiner who failed to inform police that carbon monoxide gas 
that killed the elderly couple could strike again had resigned.

Dr.
 Brent Hall, Watauga County Medical Examiner, had a report on his desk 
that explained the reasons for the Jenkins' deaths, however their 
toxicology reports did not make it to Boone police until after Jeffrey 
Williams died two months later in room 225.

Toxicology tests have confirmed that the deaths of Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning

'I don't know why they didn't expedite 
them, but the thinking at the time was that it was not carbon monoxide,'
 said Chief Police Officer Dana Crawford.

When Jeffrey and his mother checked into the hotel, they did not know about the previous victims - nor did the police.

The state said Medical Examiner Dr. Brent Hall had received the toxicology report the week before Jeffrey Williams died but failed to share those results with Watauga County authorities who could have shut down the motel.

Dr Hall suddenly resigned in November but he has not answered questions about when he received the results.

Three people died last year from carbon monoxide poisoning after staying in room 225 at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza in Boone, North Carolina

'I can’t speculate as to why we 
didn’t get them,' Police Chief Dana Crawford said, according to WSOC. 
Ms. Crawford said those documents could have saved the boy's life.

'I would like to think we would have 
been able to conclude and find the source of that carbon monoxide, and 
with that information, been able to rectify that whole situation before 
this happened,'

Ms Crawford said if her department knew 
there was a carbon monoxide death in the room, they would have worked 
with fire officials to find the leak.

He said it took investigators just hours to trace it back to a pool water heater after Williams’ death.
