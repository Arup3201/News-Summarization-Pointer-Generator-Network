A 'lost' site where the forces of Charles I won one of their biggest victories during the Civil War has been added to an English Heritage register of battlefields.

The Royalists inflicted a heavy defeat on the Parliamentarians near Lostwithiel, Cornwall, during two battles that took place in August and September 1644.

The exact sites where the fighting occurred, close to Restormel Castle, have been located by the Battlefields Trust following archaeological work and research in the archives.

Battle: Royalist forces clash with Parliamentarians during the Battle of Naseby in 1645. The Battle of Lostwithiel in 1644 was regarded as one of the key turning points in the war

Battlefield: The fighting, which happened over ten days in 1644, occurred close to Restormel Castle on the outskirts of Lostwithiel, Cornwall

They have now been added to the National Heritage List which protects historically significant sites from development.

The Royalists, who had around 12,000 footmen and 7,000 cavalry, pursued the outnumbered Parliamentarians to the outskirts of the town.

When the Earl of Essex invaded Cornwall, a Royalist stronghold, he wrongly believed that he would have significant support in the area.

Although he had around 10,000 men under his command, and at the end of the two battles which lasted 10 days, they were forced to surrender. The Earl eventually fled the site in a fishing boat.

Charles I was present during the battle and is said to have slept with his troops under a hedge.

Deborah Williams, an English Heritage designation team leader, said that the victory for Charles I was one of the key battles in the Civil War between 1642 and 1651.

'The Lostwithiel campaign of 1644 was one of the most wide-ranging battles of the civil war, marking a turning point in the war by delivering a Royalist victory, thus prolonging the war for several more bloody years,' she said.

'We are pleased that the significance of this decisive battle, to the south west and the nation, is recognised through designation.

'It is appropriate that such an important battle becomes the first addition to the list for some years. '

The addition of the two sites takes the total number of sites on the English Heritage register to 45. 

Frank Baldwin, chairman of the 
Battlefields Trust said: 'These are the first battlefields to be 
registered in England since 1995 and shows that the Register is a living
document.

'We have asked English Heritage to look at registering other battlefields, including the Wars of the Roses site at Edgcote.

'We hope English Heritage resolves these requests in the same positive way.'

The Lostwithiel sites were not originally included on the register because it was unclear exactly where the battles took place.

The registration of the battlefield 
does not mean development on the site is forbidden, but the status of 
the site must be taken into consideration.

Troops: Roundhead soldiers - troops loyal to thwe Parliamentarians - during the Civil War. At the Battle of Lostwithiel they had around 12,000 footmen

The Battlefields Trust explained that the government's National Planning Policy Framework says that development of historic battlefields should be 'wholly exceptional'.

Battlefields Trust development 
officer Julian Humphrys said: 'Development and unsystematic metal 
detecting without professional archaeological input are the main threats
to battlefields in the UK.

'But designation (as a battlefield) offers no absolute protection from either.

'Battlefields are ultimately local 
issues and having people who who own or live near battlefields 
interested in them is the best form of protection and that's what the 
Battlefields Trust is all about.'

When King Charles I took the throne in 1625, his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent

When King Charles I took the throne in 1625, his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent.

His was a style of governance defined by religious dogma and a stubborn opposition to parliamentary rule.

This bred feelings of alienation and deep mistrust in pockets of England, while in Scotland tensions with the English boiled over into bloody conflict.

The embattled king was forced to form a parliament in 1640, and within this a vocal and highly critical Puritan faction began to grow.

When a violent Catholic rebellion broke out in Ireland, disagreements over how to respond split England in two, and in 1642 the English Civil War broke out.

The Royalists, based largely in the north and west, fought for the king, while the Roundheads, also known as Parliamentarians, came mainly from the south and east.

They took their nickname from their preference for closely cropped hair, which set them apart from the ringlets of courtly Royalists.

The battles that followed saw Charles's forces, bolstered by the Welsh and Cornish, clash with a Roundhead army swollen with Londoners.

The Royalists looked to be on the brink of victory in 1643, until their enemies joined forces with the Scots.

In 1644, the king's men suffered a crushing defeat at Marston Moor, North Yorkshire, effectively conceding the north. A further loss at Naseby, Northamptonshire, was the final nail in the coffin.

The king gave himself up to the Scots and they promptly passed him on to their Roundhead allies, who were in the early stages of establishing a republican regime.

He was executed in 1649, but not before inciting further clashes known as the Second Civil War.
