There was a point when Dinushka Vethavanam couldn't bring herself to look in the mirror.

Having suffered a one-in-a-million allergic reaction from everyday painkillers, which burnt the top half of her body including her face, she was fearful of her own reflection.

Ms Vethavanam, of Melbourne, had taken some Nurofen as she was suffering from body aches last year.

They were over-the-counter drugs she had taken previously and hadn't experienced any side effects.

But this time, her body decided to reject the medication as it burnt, blistered, scabbed and peeled a layer of her skin.

Family and friends were by her bedside, ready to say goodbye, as doctors thought she wouldn't make it.

Ms Vethavanam, of Melbourne, was placed in ICU as a burns patient. She was suffering from a rare allergic reaction from an over-the-counter painkiller she had taken

The pain relief caused her body to break out in a rash and burnt the upper half of her body - including her face

Ms Vethavanam had never heard of Stevens Johnson syndrome - a severe adverse reaction to a medication - when she as diagnosed with it in July last year.

The condition, caused by any prescribed medication or off the shelf such as Ibuprofen, affects around one to two people per million and is more common among women.

It begins with flu-like symptoms, such as sore eyes according to The Stevens Johnson Syndrome Foundation, exactly what Ms Vethavanam had suffered before she went to the doctors.

She vividly recalls the day she started to feel unwell.

'It was a Friday afternoon - I know that because I was supposed to meet my friends for a drink,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

Ms Vethavanam - who was 28 at that time - went home to rest, only to find the next day she still felt awful.

Ms Vethavanam says her skin has recovered but SJS has left her body in white patches

It was when she was admitted to The Austin Hospital in Heidelberg, north-east of Melbourne, that doctors realised Ms Vethavanam had Stevens Johnson syndrome

The doctor gave her a dose of antibiotics, saying she had an infection. But symptoms rapidly became worse.

Ms Vethavanam, who lives in Eaglemont which is north of Melbourne, was then taken to the emergency room and was told she had conjunctivitis. Doctors prescribed her with eye drops and more painkillers.

Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a severe adverse reaction to a medication. 

It was named after two US paediatricians who described it in 1922.

It affects around one to two people per million and is more common among women.

Symptoms include skin rashes, blisters in the mouth, ears and nose and swelling of the eyelids.

If left untreated the condition can result in death. 

Possible complications include permanent blindness and lung damage.

Once diagnosed doctors will immediately stop the patient taking the offending drug.

Treatment includes IV fluids and high calorie formulas to promote healing.

Antibiotics are given when necessary to prevent secondary infections such as sepsis.

Pain medications such as morphine can make the patient more comfortable.

'I went home then discovered that I was breaking out in a rash, pink spotty dots, so that's when I started panicking,' she said.

'It then began turning into a black shade. At that point I didn't have a lot of strength and my face started to turn black by Monday.' 

It was when she was admitted to The Austin Hospital in Heidelberg, north-east of Melbourne, that doctors realised she had Stevens Johnson syndrome.

'At that point I was burning from the inside out so I was treated as a burns patient and transferred to the burns unit at The Alfred [a major hospital in Melbourne],' Ms Vethavanam said.

'My skin was peeling off so there were sheets of skin.

'I was also coughing up blood because my mouth was bleeding and was kept in ICU for over two weeks.'

Although she was heavily sedated, Ms Vethavanam still remembers her lowest point.

'I had no strength, couldn't walk, couldn't talk, couldn't even open my eyes,' she said.

'I was going in and out of consciousness and I remember hearing the nurses saying they need to shave my hair off because my scalp was scabbing and shedding.

'I remember waving my arm and trying to tell them "no". It was like a nightmare but when I woke up my hair was gone.'

With her body covered in black welts from her face to her torso, Ms Vethavanam wanted to keep what was left of her identity. 

'My whole appearance changed over a weekend,' she said.

'So when they told me I had to lose my hair - that was a massive down point for me. I adored my hair and it was very precious to me.'

Ms Vethavanam battled through the condition as her parents flew to her beside from Sri Lanka after being told by doctors that their daughter may not survive.

'When my mum and dad came to the hospital, they walked straight past my bed because they didn't recognise me,' she said.

'So I had trouble looking at myself in the mirror. But the doctor told me it wasn't too bad so I thought I'd give it a go. 

'When I saw my own reflection, it scared me. It wasn't the person I knew and I wasn't sure whether the people in my life would still love me looking like this.'

More than a year later, Ms Vethavanam is still on the mend but has been left with permanent scars.

'My skin has recovered a lot but there are still white patches all over my body,' she said.

'My face is back to normal but when the temperature changes my skin is so sensitive that I can feel the flush of heat instantly.

'My eyes are severely dry and sensitive to light. We're still trying to work out the best medication for them but for now I have to put in eye drops every 10 to 15 minutes. 

'I have a high risk of going blind if I catch an infection and I have to keep my eyes protected at all times. That's why I wear contact lenses but that also dries out my eyes so it's just this vicious cycle.'

The healing process has been tough as the 29-year-old began blaming herself.

'I guess afterwards I felt a lot of anger because I kept thinking that I should've never taken those tablets,' she said.

'I cried a few times but I'm grateful that I was able to fight this thing. It's a rare condition and many kids who go through it don't make it.

'Now the irony is that I can't produce tears anymore. I've actually run out of tears as a result of SJS. That's why my eyes are so dry. My tear ducts don't function anymore so I don't produce tears anymore.'

Ms Vethavanam's blog gives a detailed account from the moment she fell ill through to her road to recovery.

'As a way of healing I decided to document how I'm learning to live in my new skin,' she said.

' I think this was a way of teaching me a lesson because I never felt happy in my old skin. So you must be grateful for what you've got.

'It hasn't been easy but I'm better at accepting myself now with the help from my family and my partner Cameron.'

Ms Vethavanam is urging others to be wary of all kinds of medication. 

'It's important that you don't take meds lightly, even if they're painkillers and especially if they're for kids,' she said.

'I'm not blaming Nurofen in any way. It wasn't the product that caused my body to react this way, it was the Ibuprofen which I now have to avoid. 

'I'd taken the medication before, it wasn't my first time but my body just decided to reject them.

'You've got to be more careful of what you put in your body.'

A Nurofen spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the 'exact cause for the reaction is currently unknown and the reaction is unpredictable' and such allergic skin reactions are 'extremely rare'.

'Based on our adverse event collection data, the incidence of SJS is 1 case per 100 million packs sold,' she said.

'All Nurofen packs include warnings for consumers to stop taking and see a doctor immediately if an allergic reaction occurs.'

The spokeswoman further advises consumers to 'carefully read and adhere to the instructions provided on Nurofen packs'.

'Nurofen is sorry to hear about Dinushka Vethavanam’s condition and are glad to hear she is recovering after her diagnosis last year. Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is an extremely rare but known reaction to a multitude of triggers such as infections, medications or illness. The exact cause for the reaction is currently unknown and the reaction is unpredictable.

Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), a group of medicines that includes ibuprofen, have also been associated with rare cases of SJS, there is no confirmed causal link.

Allergic skin reactions of this type are extremely rare. Based on our adverse event collection data, the incidence of SJS is 1 case per 100 million packs sold. All Nurofen packs include warnings for consumers to stop taking and see a doctor immediately if an allergic reaction occurs.

As with all medicines, we would urge consumers to carefully read and adhere to the instructions provided on Nurofen packs. The labelling clearly lists the conditions each product is suitable to treat, the precautions for use, the recommended dose and the occasions on which it should not be taken and that a healthcare professional should be consulted by consumers in any doubt.'
