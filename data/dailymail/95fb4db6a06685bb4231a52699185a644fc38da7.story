The Arizona mother of seven charged with drug trafficking in Mexico has proclaimed her innocence in a jailhouse interview and said she never had the drugs she is accused of trying to smuggle into the United States.

Yanira Maldonado says she has been relying on her faith and the support of her family to keep her spirits up as she fights for her freedom.

'I've been reading the scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, fasting,' Maldonado told CNN. 'And all the support that I've been getting from my family, my husband, my children, and everybody out there reaching out to help.'

Tearful appear: Yanira Maldonado wept as she proclaimed her innocence from an office in a Mexican federal prison

Shocked: Mrs Maldonado said she never saw the drugs she is accused of smuggling - not even after she was arrested

In the tearful interview - which Maldonado gave from what appears to be an office in Nogales, Mexico, federal prison - the devout Mormon mother said she was shocked when Mexican military officers announced that they had found 12 pounds of marijuana beneath her bus seat after the bus was stopped at a military checkpoint.

'I was at the checkpoint. They asked us to get off bus. And they were checking for drugs or I don't know what else,' she said.

'And they say they found something under my seat. But I never saw anything. They didn't show me anything. It was just amazing all that, what they did.'

In the interview, Maldonado, who said she had traveled to Mexico to attend a funeral for her aunt, said she is a religious family woman who was innocent of the charges leveled against her.

'I'm a good mom. I love the gospel. I'm LDS. And we work hard to have what we have. You know, we're not rich, but we're very honest and we always do our best to help other people,' she said.

Maldonado's family has accused the army officers of framing her in an effort to extort a bribe. The government has not yet presented its evidence against Maldonado in court.

A Mexican state official told CNN that it appears Maldonado was, indeed, framed.

Evidence? Mexican officials claim these are the marijuana bundles that were found under Yanira Maldonado's bus seat

'Can you imagine? A passenger by himself or herself would have been unable to carry almost six kilos (12 pounds) of marijuana onto a bus without being noticed. She must've been framed,' the official, who asked not to be named, said.

Her family said on Wednesday that they are terrified she'll 'be lost' forever inside the country's poorly run prison system as they fight to get her free.

Maldonado's brother-in-law, Brandon Klippel, said the Mormon mother-of-seven from Phoenix had already been transferred to a different prison without their knowledge, and the family is frightened it'll happen again.

'One of the things the attorney said to us right in the beginning is that once you’re in the federal prison system (in Mexico), they move you around without keeping good records,' he said on the Today show.

'If she's moved and transported around, we may never see our sister again, and that's something that would just be devastating to our family.'

Klippel spoke out as Maldonado's daughter Anna Soto told NBC's Miguel Almaguer how the whole ordeal feels 'like it's a movie.'

'It's unbelievable,' Soto said. 'I feel like it's a movie, a nightmare. I want to wake up. There's no way to, and I'm like there's no way to escape.'

The woman has been moved from Hermosillo to a jail in Nogales, Mexico, just across the border from Arizona.

She'd not yet been charged with a crime, and a court hearing is scheduled for today. On Tuesday, witnesses testified to help Maldonado's case.

She claims drugs allegedly found beneath her bus seat during a police raid last week were planted there by soldiers, left by a previous passenger, or perhaps were never there at all.

A magistrate in Nogales has until 6 p.m. Friday to rule on her case or she will be sent to another facility for what could be several months behind bars.

Soto visited her mother in prison on Saturday, and described the facility as 'not very professional.'

'Luckily we both speak English and we got to talk a little bit, but I didn't feel comfortable about anything there,' she told Savannah Guthrie, adding that guards stood over her shoulder the entire time.

The family has launched a Facebook page in a bid to clear name of the woman who is a naturalized U.S. citizen but was born in Mexico.

The U.S. State Department and Arizona Senator Jeff Flake say they are communicating with Mexican authorities and the Maldonado family.

'She's scared,' said Klippel, who told Today he spoke with her by phone. 'She's in a prison that's got horrible conditions. She's not very happy at all about the situation as you can imagine, but she's very hopeful.'

The family claimed earlier this week that Maldonado was thrown in prison for smuggling marijuana after her family failed to bribe a judge soon enough. 

'Innocent': The Maldonados, who are Mormon, said they do not even drink and have never taken drugs

Family: The couple, who have seven children between them

Maldonado was returning home with her 
husband after attending her aunt's funeral in Mexico when their bus was 
stopped and police claimed drugs had been found beneath her seat.

When she was hauled into a prison, an
 attorney told her husband Gary to raise money to give to a judge 
because 'that's how it works here', her family said.

But
 when the couple, who have seven children and two grandchildren between 
them, scraped together $5,000 for her release, they still refused to 
free her.

Her
 family is now seeking the help of their state Senator and hoping to 
raise awareness of her plight, praying it will lead to her release.

They claim that the Mormon mother, who does not drink or take drugs, is innocent.

Maldonado
 and her husband were returning to Phoenix from her aunt's funeral when 
their bus was stopped at a military checkpoint near Hermosillo.

When the federales
 searched the bus, they claimed they found drugs under a seat where the 
couple - the only Americans onboard - had been sitting.

'Bribes': The couple were told they could pay off the judge because 'that's how things work here'

They initially charged Mr Maldonado but then let him go before charging his wife instead.

'Never in our lives deal with drugs or do drugs,' Mr Maldonado told Fox 10. 'Everybody from the very beginning was telling us, "We know you guys aren't guilty, but this is just the process".'

He called it 'the most frightening 
feeling you could ever imagine', adding that fellow passengers saw them 
board the bus without packages, so he is hopeful that justice with 
prevail.

A Mexican attorney told the couple to raise cash, Mrs Maldonado's brother-in-law Brandon Klippel told CBS 5.

'His
 attorney had talked to the prosecuting attorney there and came back
 to him and said, "You know how it works in Mexico, right?"' Klippel 
said. 'He said, "No I don't." The attorney said, "Well, if we
 bribe the judge – then he'll let you go".'

But when they took the money to them, they were told it was no longer about the money.

A couple of days after her arrest, she was transferred to a women's jail in Nogales, but the family was not informed. When her husband went to visit her, he was told she had been sent elsewhere.

'He panicked,' his brother, Klippel, 
said. 'He told me terror struck him. And he thought, for that period of 
time, that he'd never see his wife again.'

But on Saturday, he tracked her down to the holding cell and visited with one of their sons.

'She had a rough night,' Klippel said. 'Their interrogation included putting her in a non-air-conditioned room
 and waking her up several times in the middle of night – trying to get 
her to sign documents that she said she couldn't read.'

Family members said Mrs Maldonado had started crying during the visit, but said that she had faith others would help.

Senator Jeff Flake's office said he is personally monitoring the situation and has spoken with the deputy Mexican ambassador.

Yanira Maldonado has an attorney and will appear at a hearing in front of a judge on Monday. 

'In Mexico, I guess you're guilty until proven innocent,' said Klippel. 'So, it's just been a real nightmare for them.'

The family is providing updates on their Facebook page.
