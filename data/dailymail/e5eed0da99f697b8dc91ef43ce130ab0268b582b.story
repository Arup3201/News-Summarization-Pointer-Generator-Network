They were facing a long, tiring coach journey but they left with smiles on their faces.

Bulgarians and Romanians were pictured boarding buses to Britain today as restrictions on Eastern European immigrants working in the UK were lifted.

Many of the migrants departing from the capital Sofia were carrying all the luggage they will need for a new life in Britain.

Tens of thousands of people from Romania and Bulgaria are forecast to come to Britain following the introduction of new rules allowing them to work and study anywhere in the EU.

At the central bus station in Sofia, Bulgarian citizens queued up for vehicles embarking on a 48-hour journey through Western Europe.

The buses were set to pass through Austria, Germany and France before crossing the English Channel and arriving at London's Victoria coach station this weekend.

Yesterday was the first day that Romanians and Bulgarians were allowed to settle in Britain without having previously obtained a specialist job.

At Luton airport, Labour MP Keith Vaz personally welcomed immigrants arriving off a flight from Bucharest.

Victor Spirescu, the first Romanian to pass through immigration, said he was planning to make some money working in Britain before returning to Romania.

On the Seven Sisters Road in North London this morning, a number of young men from Romania and Bulgaria were pictured outside a hardware store looking for odd jobs.

'They said they'd do any type of work for £50 a day,' one onlooker said.

David Cameron faced a backlash from Conservative supporters and backbenchers in the run-up to the immigration controls being lifted.

A poll found that more than 80 per cent of the public favoured keeping the restrictions in place for three more years.

In response, the Prime Minister introduced a rule dictating that new migrants would be unable to claim unemployment benefits for their first three months in the country.

Additionally, migrants from the EU who are not in work or education and are unable to support themselves face being deported and banned from returning to the UK for a year.
