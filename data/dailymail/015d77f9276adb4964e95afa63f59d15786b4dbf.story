Reality TV star Sophie Kasaei has told how she lost 10lbs in five days after cruel Twitter comments about her weight forced her to partake in an intense 'detox' at boot camp.

The former Geordie Shore star blames her weight gain on the reality show that made her famous, revealing that it was impossible to stay slim on 
the MTV show because cast members are encouraged to get drunk and end up
eating at the wrong times because of the incessant partying.

Sophie, 23, admitted: 'You end up eating at stupid times and putting on weight. You are constantly on the move and don't have access to healthy food. You end up grabbing a sandwich and eating lots of other calorific things.'

New frame: Former Geordie Shore star Sophie Kasaei has lost 10lbs (L) after a gruelling week at an intense boot camp. She decided to lose weight after Twitter users branded her 'fat' when she was 11 stone (R)

At just 5ft 1in, Sophie's weight peaked at more than 11 stone. After heading to boot camp to get in shape, she lost 10lb in five days. After that she continued to gradually drop the pounds and now weighs 9st 4lb - bringing her total weightloss to 1st 10Ib.

She is pleased with her new weight but admits the intense regime has taken its toll on her body, and her slimmer figure has left her with saggy boobs.

Sophie said: 'I am getting them lifted. I have gone from a 34E to a 34D since losing the weight but my boobs are saggy and feel a bit empty.

'There is such a fashion for tops which show off the sides of your boobs – but I can't wear them because I have a big, low cleavage. They don't look right.

Happier than ever: Sophie is ecstatic with her new 9st 4lbs weight, but said boot camp was one of the hardest things she's ever done in her life

'I don't want my boobs to be bigger – I just wanted them to sag less.'

Sophie admitted she hated herself when she was at her heaviest.

She said: 'I have got so down in the past. You tell yourself: "I am fat and ugly – I'm disgusting. I need to get in shape. I need to make a change"'.

She received many hurtful comments on Twitter about her size.

'It's never from girls – they are always really supportive,' she said. 'It's young fellas who are the worst. They think nothing of going on Twitter and just saying, "You're fat."'

Hard work: Her trip involved five days of circuit training, long hikes, swims in the sea and yoga on the beach

Following in the footsteps of Made In Chelsea stars Binky Felstead and Spencer Matthews, Sophie went to No 1 Boot Camp in Ibiza.

Her trip involved five days of circuit training, long hikes, swims in the sea and yoga on the beach - all supervised by the camp's super strict military trainers.

Her normal diet of service station snacks was replaced by low-fat calories and frozen fruit.

Sophie, who worked as a hairdresser before finding fame on TV, was thrilled to lose 10lbs in such a short space of time.

Taken its toll: Sophie now wants a boob job after her weight loss have left her with 34D boobs, which she believes are 'saggy'

'It was so tough – the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. I was ready to pack it in at one point but I knew I couldn't,' she explained.

'I had to take a complete rest on the second day – my body couldn't cope with the detox. I was like a drug addict going cold turkey. Each day got better after and I felt like a new person at the end of the week.

Sophie, who lives in Newcastle, said her Geordie Shore star boyfriend of two years Joel Corry, 24, loves her new figure.
