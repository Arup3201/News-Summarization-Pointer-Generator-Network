Within the space of a year, the face staring back in the mirror at Jackie Malton was almost unrecognisable.

Though still smiling, the 42-year-old bore little resemblance to the vibrant mother pictured in March last year, brimming with hope at the prospect of marrying her partner.

Just a month later doctors dealt Mrs Malton and her then partner Jim a devastating blow – she had a lesion on her brain.

Within a year, a brain tumour had invaded her body, and despite surgery and months of treatment, just last month specialists revealed it was terminal.

Days after being told she had weeks to live, Mrs Malton decided to marry her partner of six years in what she describes as a 'dream wedding'.

Mrs Malton's husband, Jim, 38, said: 'It was always her dream as a little girl to have a perfect wedding, I think it is for a lot of girls.

'She's an incredibly strong woman, she's just a really kind person and great fun.

'She worked as a barmaid in her last job at her local working men's club in Bentley and was loved by everyone.

'Jackie couldn't believe the wedding, the day itself was really busy, she was over-the-moon even though it absolutely exhausted her.'

Mr Malton said they first discovered his wife's cancer when she began to suffer headaches which lasted for an entire week.

He said: 'It just started getting increasingly worse, after a week of solid headaches I said "You have to go to the doctor."

'The doctor said "I'm not happy with some of these results", and he sent her up to Doncaster Hospital. 

Doctors found a lesion on her brain, and tests revealed it to be a glioblastoma multiforme – a type of aggressive tumour that can sometimes spread - and said she needed surgery immediately.

Although they removed some of the tumour a week later, it was then the couple were given the devastating news Mrs Malton's cancer was terminal.

A glioblastoma is an aggressive and fast-growing form of brain tumour.

Fast growing tumours are much more likely to come back after treatment than slow growing tumours. 

The outlook is not good for people with more aggressive grade 3 and 4 tumours.

Only about 20 in 100 children (20 per cent) diagnosed with glioblastoma will live for five years. 

Many adults live for less than a year.

She endured months of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and treatment with steroids to fight the disease.

These caused body to swell and her appearance to change dramatically.

Then, on 22 January this year, the couple were told that despite the gruelling treatment, she had only weeks to live.

Mr Malton describes the utter shock of hearing this news.

He said: 'They said there's nothing more we can do, we asked them "how long"?

'We thought maybe months, but they said a few weeks.'

The pair thought of marriage straight away, having got engaged before Mrs Malton was diagnosed in April last year.

However, they didn't know if they could afford a lavish wedding.

Mr Malton said: 'It became apparent I would have to care for her and money started to run out really quickly.

'It was one of Jackie's family that came across the Eve Merton Dreams Trust, they have been fantastic and organised an amazing day.'

The Eve Merton Dreams Trust is a Doncaster-based charity that raises money to help create an unforgettable memory for a terminally or seriously ill cancer patient in the borough.

They helped with every aspect of the Maltons' wedding, from Mr Malton's suit, to Mrs Malton's wedding dress. 

Mr Malton said: 'Jackie looked absolutely stunning. When I was standing there, and the bridesmaids were walking up the aisle and parted so I could see Jackie, I had a lump in my throat.

Mrs Malton was in a wheelchair for her wedding day, due to her deteriorating condition. The pair spent their wedding night eating McDonalds in the hospice, which Mr Malton said was 'perfect' as they were together

Mr Malton said: 'Jackie looked absolutely stunning. When I was standing there, and Jackie was coming up the aisle, I had a lump in my throat. It took everything not to start crying there and then, but I wanted to hold it together because I knew what an emotional day it would be'

'It took everything not to start crying there and then, but I wanted to hold it together because I knew what an emotional day it would be.'

Mrs Malton was in a wheelchair and was unable to walk up the aisle because of her deteriorating condition.

Her daughters Sheriden, 22, Chantelle, 16, and eight-year-old Caitlin, as well as Jim's 16-year-old daughter, Kayleigh, were by her side as bridesmaids.

Mr Malton's son, Kai, 12, was an usher in the wedding, which was held at Doncaster Rovers Keepmoat Stadium.

The newly-weds retired to St John's Hospice, where Mrs Malton is currently receiving treatment, after the ceremony, while their friends and family celebrated with a reception.

And while eating a McDonald's in a hospital bed might not be the most traditional way to spend a wedding night, Mr Malton said it was all he had ever wanted.

He said: 'The girls at St John's Hospice put rose petals on two beds and pushed them together for us.

'We ate a McDonald's and cuddled, which was just perfect. 

To us, that was better than if we had been at The Ritz or anywhere, because we were together.'

Mrs Malton will be able to go home once her condition is stable and her pain medication has been prescribed.

The whole family is looking forward to this moment, Mr Malton said, so they can make the most of every day of their lives together.
