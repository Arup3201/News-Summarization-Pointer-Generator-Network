Exchanging heels for a metal-cast claw and toes for an embossed leather beak, a collection of stilettos inspired by birds, called Bird-Witched, will soon be on display as part of a Brooklyn exhibit celebrating innovative high-heels.

Japanese shoe designer Masaya Kushino, known for his (creative designs is too vague, say something like ‘known for his wild sense of style), will lend his creations to the Brooklyn Museum's Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe, opening on September 10.

The museum-worthy creations boast claw heels and feathered tails, but according to translated reports, Mr Kushino designed them with the complete intention for them to be worn on the street.

Meant for walking: Celebrated Japanese shoe designer Masaya Kushino created these designs in collaboration with the Kyoto Costume Institute for its exhibition Future Beauty

Historical appeal: Mr Kushino worked with textile mill Hosoo - which has created luxury kimono fabrics since the 17th century - on the brocade for the shoes

He constructed the shoes' uppers out of feathers, as well as Nishijin brocade – a textile traditionally used for kimono.

The brocade was created in collaboration with Hosoo, a Kyoto-based textile mill that has been a luxury supplier of kimono fabrics since the 17th century.

Mr Kushino was originally commissioned for the collection by the renowned Kyoto Costume Institute to be included in its travelling exhibit called Future Beauty.

The designs were inspired by the work of Edo-period painter, Ito Jakuchu, who died in 1800 and is known for his rooster tableaus.

World-traveller: The mini-collection has traveled the globe to spots like London and Munich, and will soon make landfall in Brooklyn

Speaking to the Japan Times about his 
creations, Mr Kushino said: ‘Inspired by the rooster in Ito Jakuchu’s 
painting, I would like my shoes to resonate with the obsessive creative 
energy of that great master of the Edo Period. By collaborating with 
HOSOO, which has superb craftsmanship and a tenacious attitude to 
achieve the best, I discovered the power of tradition.’

Bird-Witched has already made stops in London, Munich, and Salem, Massachusetts as part of its inclusion in the Future Beauty tour, which began in 2010.

In the details: The toe of the collection's most elaborate design was created to resemble a bird's face

Tail feather: The same shoe features a beautifully crafted mane of soft feathers that plume from the heel

Akiko Fukai, the Kyoto Costume 
Institute’s chief curator, told the Japan Times of the exhibit, which 
celebrates modern Japanese fashion: ‘What has allowed designers to 
realize their ideas in the field of materials is the extremely high 
level of Japanese dyeing and weaving techniques exemplified by the 
master-craftsmanship and the pure spirit of inquiry of Kyoto artisans.’
