A women admitted to a Chicago hospital in June following an alcohol binge is suing after a doctor took photos of her without her consent and posted them online.

Elena Chernyakova, 23, is claiming invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress in a $1.5million lawsuit filed against Dr. Vinaya Puppala, the Feinberg School of Medicine and the Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

The incident took place when she was admitted to the hospital earlier this year after becoming intoxicated, she called the doctor for moral support because he was a family friend, she told WLS.

This ends here: Elena Chernyakova is taking a stand so this type of behavior does not affect other women

Ms Chernyakova was taken to the hospital after overindulging in alcohol, she was unconscious for about eight hours.

It was during this time that Mr Pappala reportedly snapped embarrassing pictures of her and posted them online with humiliating hashtags including 'Cuvee #bottle #service #gone #bad,' her lawsuit claims.

About
 15 minutes after she regained consciousness, Mr Puppala, who knew Ms Chernyakova through a mutual friend and was called to the hospital to keep her company, visited her 
hospital room before gaining access to her medical records

'I've never been in a situation like that, so I just wanted someone there for moral support,' she told the station.

He then returned several 
hours later to take photographs of her ‘while she was on the hospital 
bed, crying and attached to an IV,’ according to the complaint.

Mr Puppala
 was seen by hospital security in the hospital taking the pictures and 
was asked to delete them immediately.

'The security guard asked him to delete these pictures, which he said he will. But obviously, found out he never deleted them,' she continued.

He knew her previously: Elena Chernyakova, left, claims Dr. Vinaya Puppala, right, took photos of her while she was recovering from an alcohol binge at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago

Instead he posted the photographs on Facebook and Instagram, along with ‘attached statements of commentary’ about her condition, according to the complaint.

The complaint alleges that Ms Chernyakova never agreed to be photographed, and was not even in a condition to provide her consent.

The hospital and Feinberg Medical School ‘substantially assisted’ Puppala in allowing this to happen, according to the complaint. 

According to her website, Ms Chernyakova is an actress, model, and ex-professional tennis player from Moscow, Russia. 

She started acting in July 2012 after 
graduating from Northwestern University with a degree in Communication 
Studies, Business, and International Studies. She has appeared in 
several films and TV shows, including Superhero Me, Psychotic and 
Chicagolicious.

According to her complaint, Ms Chernyakova has the ‘potential to someday work for Fortune 500 companies, which may now not occur because of said photographs.’

The Northwestern Memorial Hospital is investigating the allegations and has said it will cooperate with authorities, but emphasized that Puppala was acting ‘entirely on his own.’

‘Any invasion of privacy at the hands of our trusted health personnel or extended care team of training fellows is unacceptable and not indicative of the Patients' First culture of Northwestern Memorial Hospital, which has zero tolerance for exploitation of private health information, including photography,’ the hospital said in a statement to ABCNews.

Mr Puppala is a fellow in the Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine Fellowship at Feinberg, Michigan, which works in conjunction with Northwestern Memorial Hospital, according to court documents. 

Ms Chernyakova told WLS she filed the lawsuit to draw a line in the sand and make sure this never happens to anyone else again.

'If I didn't raise a voice and legally pursue this, then how many other patients would this happen to in the future?'
