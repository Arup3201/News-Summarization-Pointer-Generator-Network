Ready to be rib-tickled? Then brace yourself for the funniest joke of this year’s Edinburgh Fringe Festival...

It comes courtesy of little-known stand-up comedian Rob Auton and goes: ‘I heard a rumour that Cadbury is bringing out an oriental chocolate bar. Could be a Chinese Wispa.’

His one-liner hit a spot with voters in a public poll and secured him first place ahead of the efforts of more famous funny men including Tim Vine and Marcus Brigstocke.

Winner: Rob Auton's joke won the fans' vote at this year's Edinburgh Fringe 

Actor and comedian Vine, who is best known from the sitcom Not Going Out and is the brother of broadcaster Jeremy Vine, could only manage fourth place with: ‘My friend told me he was going to a fancy dress party as an Italian island. I said to him ‘Don’t be Sicily’.’

Brigstocke, a regular on TV panel shows like Have I Got News For You and QI, scraped seventh with: ‘You know you are fat when you hug a child and it gets lost.’

Former paintbrush salesman Auton, 30, from York, who has been doing stand-up since 2008, won almost a quarter of the votes (2,570) in the annual Funniest Joke of the Fringe award, run by the television channel Dave.

A panel of judges sat through hours of material at 60 shows at the festival before drawing up a short-list of 20 jokes which were then put to the public vote.

Auton said: ‘I’m honoured to receive this award and just pleased that a joke that tackles the serious issue of the invention of a new chocolate bar can be laughed at by the people of Britain.’

Second place went to Alex Horne with: ‘I used to work in a shoe-recycling shop. It was sole-destroying.’

Alfie Moore came third with: ‘I’m in a same-sex marriage... the sex is always the same’ - proving a touch of ‘Carry On’-style sauciness can still tickle Britons’ fancy.

Perhaps the most cerebral, and certainly the shortest, gag came from Liam Williams: ‘The universe implodes. No matter’ - but that only managed eighth place.

There was also a list of shame, featuring the worst jokes in the judges’ opinion. These included: ‘I thought ex-pats were people who used to be called Pat’, and: ‘My wife said to me recently, ‘Do you fancy going gay clubbing?’ I said, ‘No, it sounds violent’.’

Tim Vine also featured among the groanworthy gags with: ‘I once did a gig in a zoo. I got babooned off.’

Previous winners of the funniest joke award, now in its sixth year, include Dan Antopolski for: ‘Hedgehogs. Why can’t they just share the hedge?’ and Nick Helm for: ‘I needed a password eight characters long so I picked Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.’
