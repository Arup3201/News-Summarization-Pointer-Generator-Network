An MMA fighter ended a recent bout the best way possible - with a move straight from Street Fighter.

Shane Campbell was taking on Derek Boyle in the match, and appeared to be well on his way to a victory, when he suddenly crouched down after landing a kick on Boyle and delivered a hadouken.

The hadouken, which literally means wave motion fist, is a special move performed by characters in the classic arcade game Street Fighter.

It should come as no surprise that shortly after Campbell quarter-circle forward punched his opponent, he won the match.

Campbell, who fights out of a gym in Stoney Creek, Ontario, has also been considered the best middleweight kickboxer in North America over the past few years. 

The 28-year-old is the current WMA World Pro Muay Thai Champion.
