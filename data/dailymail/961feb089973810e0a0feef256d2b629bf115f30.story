Residents of Goulburn in country NSW got a surprise when they discovered their main tourist attraction had a serious case of 'blue balls'.

The Big Merino has had a paint job as part of a campaign to raise awareness about prostate and testicular cancer and encourage men to get themselves checked regularly.

The giant monument is located in the Southern Tablelands of NSW and has got the town talking about the slogan 'have you got the balls?'  painted on the rear of the ram.

Blue September is a nationwide awareness and fundraising initiative about all the cancers that affect men - not just prostate and testicular cancer, but also bowel, lung, liver, pancreatic and other cancers.

Campaign director Mike Chapman told Daily Mail Australia that the biggest problem with men and cancer is 'late diagnosis'.

'Firstly, early diagnosis saves lives, it’s as simple as that. Men all too often present to the doctor too late with symptoms. Awareness through PR and media efforts helps change that,' Mr Chapman said.

'Secondly, cancer research is key. If you are diagnosed, funding ongoing research leads to better treatment options and outcomes.

'We are campaigning to encourage men to get themselves checked regularly because it's all about early detections.' 

It took six hours to paint the testicles and slogan on The Big Merino on Wednesday and will be removed at the end of the campaign.

'We thought the Big Merino was an obvious choice because it's located in the heart of Australia. It was just hanging there so we thought, 'why not?'.

'It's a great idea to get the word out and get people talking.'

Mr Chapman said the campaign is also looking into different ways of spreading awareness.

'We moved to Melbourne on Thursday to paint the V8 Supercars grid blue ahead of the Wilson Security Sandown 500, which starts on Friday.

The campaign plans to continue running the blue streak throughout Australia and the next stop is the Wrest Point Hotel Casino of Sandy Bay in Hobart, Tasmania on September 19.

'Why blue? Because it represents men. Women have always campaigned with the colour pink so we wanted to do something similar but a different approach to our fundraising.

Mr Chapman is encouraging businesses and retailers, as well as individuals to support this worthy cause by purchasing Blue September wristbands (which allows you to write the name of a loved one past or present), paint their face blue, donate money or lend a hand as a volunteer.

The fundraising campaign has raised nearly $3 million since inception 6 years ago. Funds go to the Australian Prostate Cancer Research and Australian Cancer Research Foundation to research for prevention and early diagnosis initiatives targeting men.

Mr Chapman said the campaign has attracted a lot of high profile celebrities.

'We've had different characters involved from Mark Holden, Kyle and Jackie O, Marcia Hines, AFL Carlton's Chris Judd, singers Reece Mastin and Ronan Keating and many more.
