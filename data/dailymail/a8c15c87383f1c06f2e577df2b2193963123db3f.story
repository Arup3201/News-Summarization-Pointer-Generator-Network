We've already seen 'planking' and 'milking', now witness the latest bizarre student fad: 'McDiving'.

It seems the time-honoured tradition of piling into McDonald's at the end of a boozy night out is now incomplete without an attempt to launch oneself over the counter at unsuspecting fast food workers.

Video clips of students' efforts - which often end with the culprit being hauled out from the kitchen by disgruntled staff - are receiving thousands of hits on YouTube.

'McDiving': Video clips show drunk students taking a short run-up before launching themselves across the counter at McDonald's restaurants from Bath to Aberdeen

Out you go: One man who performed a McDive while dressed as a giant banana is seen being hauled out from behind the counter by staff

One clip shows a man performing a McDive
while dressed as a giant banana, before being unceremoniously dragged 
from behind the counter by a bouncer.

Similar scenes have been captured at branches of the fast food restaurant up and down the country, and the 'sport' even has its own dedicated Facebook page.

The page features a brief explanation of the craze, which reads: 'McDiving is the new sport of today. It's very simple: You visit a McDonald's and dive over the counter.

'Beware you must be prepared for the wrath of the bouncers.'

Success: A student celebrates after successfully making it the other side of the counter at a McDonald's branch

Undergraduates in Bath, Newcastle and Aberdeen have been filmed McDiving, but students in Leeds claim to have kick-started the craze.

Jake Warren, a politics and social policy graduate from Leeds University, said: 'A friend of mine claims to have 
invented the sport.

'There was a McDonalds in Leeds where we used to go 
after a night out and he said "I’m going to do a McDive", then he dived 
over the counter.

'The premise is pretty simple, you just dive over the counter,' the 22-year-old said.

'I thought it was quite funny when I first saw it.'

Prank: According to one student, the key to a successful McDive is a mixture of confidence and timing

Inebriated: The latest craze follows previous internet fads like planking and milking

Mr Warren, who said the key to a successful McDive was a mixture of confidence and timing, said the funniest part of the prank was the shocked reaction of staff and customers.

'They usually are cheering and laughing. May be some please are annoyed but most find it funny,' he said.

'I preferred to be the cameraman as the bouncers don’t take to it too kindly.'

McDonald's said in a statement: 'We do not condone jumping over our restaurant front counters as it poses a serious health and safety risk to both the participants and our restaurant staff.'

'Milking', which originated in 
Newcastle, saw students filming themselves pouring four pint cartons of 
milk over their heads, while 'planking' involves posing for a photograph
lying face-down in the plank position in an unlikely public place.

'New sport': McDiving now has its own dedicated Facebook page, which warns participants to beware the 'wrath' of bouncers in the fast food restaurants
