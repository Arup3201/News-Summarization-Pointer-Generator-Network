Proving to be masters of disguise, these nocturnal birds hide in walls, trees and stones in a bid to hunt for their breakfast.

But a wildlife photographer was able to pick them out with his camera lens as they perched silently waiting for their prey in Chatsworth, Derbyshire.

In the selection of obscured images captured by a photographer, known only as Villager Jim, sees the wise creatures use different environments such as a stone wall and a barn doorway to make themselves invisible.

The nocturnal birds are masters of disguise as they hide in front of trees and walls as they wait for their breakfast. Can you spot the hidden owl in this picture? 

The owl, circled above, perches on a wall as it blends into the bark of the tree. The images were captured by wildlife photographer Villager Jim in Derbyshire

The 49-year-old said: ‘The owls will camouflage themselves against the stone wall while they sit in wait for their next meal.

‘Generally it will be worms and sometimes small mice, but every now and again they will get a bird too.

‘It’s one of those questions that will never be answered - how do they make themselves the same colour as the stone wall?’

The wildlife photographer, whose work has featured on BBC Countryfile, believes it is a conundrum not that everyone is able to spot.

‘It’s one of those things where you will sit and sit and some people still can’t see it,’ said Villager Jim.

‘The only real way you will see one in the flesh is when you see them from an angle as a silhouette.

‘You have to see them either move or standing close to a light. They just go invisible.’

The wildlife photographer, whose work has featured on BBC Countryfile, believes it is a conundrum not that everyone is able to spot and says its even harder in the flesh

‘The only real way you will see one in the flesh is when you see them from an angle as a silhouette. You have to see them either move or standing close to a light,' he says

The birds have become accustomed to Villager Jim, who sits an waits in the early hours of the morning to get the shots.

He said: ‘They’re getting more used to me now, so they don’t fly away quite as often.

‘They’ve really done well this year. They’ve paired up and bred really well. They’re now growing in numbers.’ 

The bird's nest location varies based on its habitat, but their homes have been found in holes in trees, rocks, cliffs, river banks, walls and buildings

The birds, which are most active at dusk, have become accustomed to Villager Jim, who sits an waits in the early hours of the morning to get the photographs

Villager Jim has several accolades and appeared in a book portraying the British Wildlife Photography Awards 2013 and has also won the Springwatch competition

His images portray many aspects of the Peak District, including the early-morning owls in Chatsworth, Derbyshire, in this mystical picture series

Three owls sit in a disused barn window in the early hours before hunting for their prey. There is a fourth owl camouflaged in this picture, but can you see it?

The fourth owl can be seen perched on the roof of the barn. The birds are farsighted, meaning they are unable to see things close to them very clearly

Some owls can turn their heads as far as 270 degrees and these birds are much quieter in flight than most birds of prey, while hunting for food like other small birds 

 Another owl sits on top of a stone wall, in the left of the picture. The walls are a prominent feature in the Peak District and are home to a vast array of wildlife

As the sun comes up, an owl peers at the camera lens while it waits patiently for its breakfast. The birds generally eat worms but sometimes they have small mice

Owls cannot move their eyes within their sockets to a great extent, which means they must turn their entire head to see in a different direction
