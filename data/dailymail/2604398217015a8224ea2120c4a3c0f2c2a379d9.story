Mortgage approvals have fallen by a fifth since tougher checks were introduced less than three weeks ago

Mortgage approvals have fallen by a fifth since tougher checks were introduced less than three weeks ago, according to one of the UK’s biggest lenders.

The startling figure - disclosed to the Mail - is the first sign that more borrowers are being rejected for home loans since the new rules were enforced on April 26. 

There are growing fears that mortgages will soon become more expensive and harder to qualify for. 

The Bank of England is today expected to indicate interest rates are likely to rise within the next 12 months – possibly before the end of the year.

The prospect of an interest rate rise comes as the Financial Ombudsman Service will today warn record numbers of people are struggling with their mortgage.

Nearly 13,700 people contacted the service last year for help with their mortgage or another secured loan, which is the largest-ever number.

Many are in a state of ‘debt denial’, which means they refuse to deal with the problem until it is too late.

Lasting up to three hours, the stricter vetting is designed to prevent a return to the reckless lending which contributed to the biggest recession in living memory.

Applicants are being asked intrusive questions about their finances and personal life, including whether they eat steak or play golf.

Some experts are concerned the rules have gone too far and believe a ‘boxing ticking’ approach is freezing out some applicants who can comfortably afford to pay a mortgage. 

Brokers complain that applications which typically took a month to process are now taking five to six weeks. Some lenders introduced the stricter tests months before the new regime officially came into force.

Last night one leading expert said the same lenders asking ‘frankly ridiculous questions’ are routinely failing to ask how much savings an applicant has.

This means those who have saved money to pay for extra expenses such as children’s school fees are being rejected, as the lender assumes the fees will have to be deducted from their salary.

Ray Boulger from mortgage broker John Charcol described this as the ‘key failure’ of the so-called Mortgage Market Review. 

He said: ‘On a long term basis, tougher rules mean that there will be clearly be some reduction in the number of people who get approved for mortgages. 

‘The key failure in the system is lenders are not taking into account savings. 

‘Lenders appear to assume savings are irrelevant and that people will blow all their money on a Lamborghini.’

The concerns will not go unnoticed by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who will today be quizzed about the state of the housing market and the risks of a dangerous new bubble.

The Canadian, who has already promised to be ‘vigilant’ about rising house prices, will outline what the central bank can do to prevent an unsustainable boom – including stress tests on the banking system and a clampdown on risky mortgage lending.

The Bank is expected to raise its forecasts for the UK economy – paving the way for an early rise in interest rates.

The economy is now within a whisker of its pre-recession peak and among the fastest growing in the developed world – undermining the case for record low rates which have been held at 0.5 per cent since March 2009.

At the Bank’s last inflation report in February, Mr Carney hinted that rates could rise next spring.But stronger growth and lower unemployment could force the Bank to bring that date forward when it publishes its latest inflation report today.

Former Bank of England economist Rob Wood, who now works at Berenberg Bank, said the Bank is likely to ‘admit that a rate hike is coming sooner rather than later’.

He said: ‘Record low interest rates are increasingly unnecessary.’

Some analysts believe rates could rise as soon as November this year.

Andrew Sentance, a former member of the monetary policy committee that sets interest rates, called on the Bank to ‘prepare the ground for a rise in interest rates later this year’. 

He added: ‘You can only make gradual and limited interest rate rises if you make them in good time. If you delay you then have to push rates up quite sharply.’

But the figures released from the Ombudsman today reveals the tightrope the Bank of England is walking. 

They cast doubt on the ability of many families to cope with an increase in interest rate, if they cannot afford their loan when rates are at a rock-bottom level.

Tony Boorman, the chief ombudsman, said many of the cases are ‘heart-breaking’ because people face losing their home after becoming overwhelmed by their debts.

The Financial Ombudsman Service said many people are ‘unrealistic’ about how much help their lender can give them, such as asking for their mortgage to be written off or their monthly payments to be suspended indefinitely.

Of all the cases that come to the service when people say they are in ‘severe financial difficulty’, half involve problems with their mortgage, it said.

One of Britain’s biggest housebuilders yesterday said the clampdown on risky mortgage lending will benefit the economy in the long-run.

Pete Redfern, chief executive of Taylor Wimpey, said: ‘The UK housing market continues to perform strongly with sales rates and pricing at the upper end of our expectations. We believe that the recent introduction of new regulations is a positive move for the long term health of the market.’
