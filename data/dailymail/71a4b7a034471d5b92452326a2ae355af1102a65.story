A senior Pentagon official ordered an emergency review of the military's use of an anti-malaria drug known to have severe psychiatric side effects - nine days after the Afghan massacre in which a U.S. solider allegedly shot dead 17 civilians including nine children, it has been alleged.

The notorious drug Mefloquine, also known as Lariam, has been implicated in a number of suicides and homicides in the military spanning back more than ten years, with side effects including paranoia, hallucinations and psychotic behaviour.

It is now being suggested that Staff Sgt Robert Bales, who is accused of the shooting, may have taken the drug before the March 11 massacre.

Claim: It is now being suggested that Sgt Robert Bales was given the anti-malaria drug Mefloquin before the Afghan massacre which should not be administered to soldiers with prior brain injuries

The military has used the drug for years despite its known side effects and in 2009, they almost banned it due to its dangers. But a subsequent order suggested its use should be restricted and not given to soldiers who have suffered a traumatic brain injury.

Mefloquin is used to treat malaria and was developed by Army researchers towards the end of the Vietnam War.

It gained support among the fighting forces because it works in areas where mosquitoes developed resistance to an earlier treatment, chloroquine, and requires just one tablet a week, not the daily dose needed with other medications.

Side effects include seizures, depression, hallucinations, violent behaviour, feeling that others want to harm you, thoughts of hurting or killing yourself and many others.

Almost four decades after inventing it, the U.S. Army pushed it to the back of its medicine cabinet.

The about-face followed years of complaints and concerns that mefloquine caused psychiatric and physical side effects.

Over the past four years, the Army 
slashed by almost 75 per cent the amount of mefloquine it prescribes, even as it
 sent thousands more soldiers to malaria-prone Afghanistan.

Soldiers who had suffered from traumatic brain injuries were particularly advised against using it.

'Mefloquine is a zombie drug. It's dangerous, and it should have been killed off years ago,' said Dr. Remington Nevin, an epidemiologist and Army major who has published research that he said showed the drug can be potentially toxic to the brain.

When Bales was in Iraq in 2010, he 
sustained a massive brain injury. No one has been able to confirm 
whether he had been given the drug or not, citing privacy rules.

On March 11, it is alleged that the father-of-two sneaked out of his base before dawn and crept into houses in two nearby villages, opening fire on sleeping families within.

Bales allegedly used his 9mm pistol and M-4 rifle, which was outfitted with a grenade launcher, to kill four men, four women, two boys and seven girls, then burning some of the bodies.

The Huffington Post obtained a task order issued by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs  Jonathan Woodson on March 20 which called for a review to ensure the drug was being administered appropriately.

The website claims he called for an immediate 'review of Mefloquine prescribing practices' to be completed by the following 
Monday, six days later.

The order said: 'Some deployed service members may be 
prescribed Mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis without appropriate 
documentation in their medical records and without proper screening for 
contraindications.'

It also notes that this review must 
include troops at 'deployed locations'.

Spokeswoman for the Department of Defense Cynthia Smith issued a statement saying: 'The department wide review of Mefloquine prescription practices has no connection to the Staff Sgt Robert Bales investigation. 

'Assistant Secretary of Health Affairs Jonathan Woodson requested this review in January to ensure each service conducts proper screening, patient education, and medical documentation.'

In response to the Huffington Post's claims the email was sent on March 20, she said it was an army issue.

Late last year, almost four decades after inventing a potent anti-malarial drug, the U.S. Army pushed it to the back of its medicine cabinet.

The dramatic about-face followed years of complaints and concerns that mefloquine caused psychiatric and physical side effects even as it was used around the globe as a front-line defense against the mosquito-borne disease that kills about 800,000 people a year.

'Mefloquine is a zombie drug. It's dangerous, and it should have been killed off years ago,' said Dr Remington Nevin, an epidemiologist and Army major who has published research that he said showed the drug can be potentially toxic to the brain.

He called it 'probably the worst-suited drug for the military' and noted that its side effects can closely mirror symptoms of stress disorders related to combat, making diagnosis of neurological problems difficult.

Over the past three years, the Army slashed by almost 75 per cent the amount of mefloquine it prescribes, even as it sent thousands more soldiers to malaria-prone Afghanistan.

The decrease in dose followed two 
orders from military and Pentagon leaders in 2009. One, from the Army's 
surgeon general, ordered the branch to limit its use to specific 
circumstances. Other branches, however, continue to favor mefloquine.

It gained support among the fighting 
forces because it works in areas where mosquitoes developed resistance 
to an earlier treatment, chloroquine, and requires just one tablet a 
week, not the daily dose needed with other medications.

In a case which has parallels with the massacre, in 2003 the army dropped the case against Staff Sgt Georg-Andreas Pogany, who also faced the death penalty, after he was charged with cowardly conduct as a result of fear.

It came after he saw the shredded body of a gunned-down Iraqi and had what he thought was a panic attack - vomiting and hallucinations.

A psychologist diagnosed a normal combat stress reaction and told him to rest and then return to duty.

Instead, Pogany was shipped back to Fort Carson and charged with the crime, which is punishable by death under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

The last such conviction in the Army occurred during the Vietnam War.

The charges were dropped after doctors later determined that Pogany suffered from Lariam toxicity, which affected his behaviour when he was deployed in Iraq.

Former army psychiatrist Elspeth Cameron Ritchie highlighted the continued use of the drug in the military and its connections with psychotic episodes.

In her Time blog, she wrote: 'One obvious question to consider is whether he was on mefloquine, an anti-malarial medication.

'This medication has been increasingly associated with neuro-psychiatric side effects, including depression, psychosis, and suicidal ideation.

'The U.S. military has been avoiding the use of Mefloquine for some years. Yet it is still prescribed in some cases, since it is effective and needs only once a week dosing. It is still used in Afghanistan.'

Bales' wife Karilyn spoke out for the first time about the accusations against her husband and said she found them 'unbelievable' and claimed they were not the actions of her husband.

She also told NBC's Matt Lauer that Bales showed no signs of PTSD and wasn't having any difficulties sleeping.

Questions to Bales' lawyer John Henry Browne were not immediately returned. But he has previously claimed his client has apparent mental health issues and is suffering with memory loss, among other things.

Many family members of U.S. soldiers have blamed the drug on their loved ones' suicides.

Retired Navy Capt Gary Foster said he cut his career short in part because of the effects of taking mefloquine in 2008 and 2009.

'I began to suffer short term memory loss, not able to recall what I had done earlier,' he said. 'I also had more bouts of anxiety, and I cannot for the life of me tell you why.'

In February 2009, Army Surgeon General Eric Schoomaker sent a policy memo to doctors saying it should be used only if soldiers could not tolerate doxycycline, a general antibiotic effective at preventing malaria.

In September 2009, Ellen P. Embrey, who at the time was deputy assistant secretary of defense overseeing health affairs, sent a letter similar to Schoomaker's. This time, it was directed across all military branches.

A small but vocal group of anti-mefloquine campaigners seized on the memos as vindication.

'I was stunned,' said retired Navy commander Bill Manofsky, who said he sustained permanent damage to his sense of balance after taking Lariam in Kuwait in 2002 and has been a persistent critic of the drug.

In 2008, the Army dispensed 8,574 courses of the drug. In 2010, it fell to 2,054. At the same time, the Army increased fivefold the number of doxycycline prescriptions — to more than 80,000 — reflecting the increasing number of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan.

Spending followed a similar pattern, with the Pentagon buying almost $1.8 million of mefloquine in 2009, enough for about 10,000 yearlong courses.

The amount dropped to $1.5 million last year. So far this year, the military has spent only about $50,000. It's not clear how many of the tablets have been dispensed.

In August, Sen Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, wrote to the secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs, urging them to strengthen safeguards for the use of the drug.
