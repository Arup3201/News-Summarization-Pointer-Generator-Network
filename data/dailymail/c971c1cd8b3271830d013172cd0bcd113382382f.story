Obvious box office favourites like Star Wars and the Wizard of Oz were on the list, but it was the dress Audrey Hepburn wore in the Ascot scene of the critically acclaimed 1964 musical that topped the lot.

Second on the list was James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 which featured in Goldfinger and Thunderball which sold for £2.67m ($4.1m) in 2010.

A prop from the all-time classic film Casablanca - the piano from Rick's Cafe Americain - came in third. It sold last year for £2.2m ($3.3m). 

Original props and costumes from The Wizard of Oz were among the most sought-after and valuable of all movie memorabilia, with the most expensive being the original costume worn by Burt Lahr as the Cowardly Lion.

The costume, which was made from genuine lion skin and fur, sold last year for a record £2m ($3.077m).

The list also includes the  Orson Welles' Oscar for Best Screenplay which he was awarded for Citizen Kane, a Panavision PSR 35 mm camera used by George Lucas during principle photography on the Star Wars film and Aragorn's sword from Lord of the Rings.

Musical landmark the 1939 Wizard of Oz Starred Julie Garland and won two Oscars, one for best music original song and another for best music original score 

The list was compiled by Picollecta, an online community for collectors.

Dawn Bruce, from Picollecta said: 'I think the reason pieces like these sell so well is because of how iconic the films are.

'The My Fair Lady dress is one of Audrey Hepburn's most popular films, along with Breakfast At Tiffany's, and the style in that film is held in high regard.

'It's the same with pieces from Casablanca and The Wizard of Oz, it represents a time in cinema that seems so far away now, so different from ours.

Orson Welles' Oscar for Best Screenplay (left) for Citizen Kane (1942), sold in 2011 for £571.343 ($861,542), while Aragorn's sword Anduril from Lord of the Rings (2003), sold in 2014, for £289,800 ($437,000) 

The Lord of the Rings Trilogy won staggering 17 Oscars overall and grossed a total of $1.9 billion ($2.92 billion) worldwide

'A film doesn't have to be award-winning for the memorabilia to do well, it's to do with how much of a following a film has.

'Many people now are much more interested in buying a piece of movie history than say an antique vase. It feels more personal to them as films are a huge part of people's lives.

'I think there is a bit of competition between high end collectors. People with private collections want to own the most iconic, instantly recognisable pieces.'
