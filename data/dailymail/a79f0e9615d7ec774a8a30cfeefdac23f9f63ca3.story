The conspiracy theories are as old as the plays themselves.

Was Shakespeare responsible for the greatest love - and revenge - stories ever told? Or was he merely the ‘barely literate frontman’ dreamt up to conceal the author’s true identity?

Whatever the truth, members of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust have taken the newest threat to the Bard’s reputation very seriously.

Shakespeare's name is being temporarily removed from pub and street signs to support a campaign against Hollywood film Anonymous, which claims the Bard did not write the material attributed to him

Yesterday, they removed and covered up his name from street and pub signs in a campaign against a new film seeking to portray the Bard as a cover for the Earl of Oxford.

Activists from the charity covered nine road signs, 16 pub signs and a large memorial in the playwright’s hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, in a bid to show what the country would be like without its greatest literary export.

The ‘guerrilla protest’ coincided with the premiere of the new Hollywood blockbuster ‘Anonymous’, which campaigners said was an attempt to ‘rewrite English culture’.

A portrait of William Shakespeare - but did the Earl of Oxford really write his plays for him?

The film, by Independence Day director Roland Emmerich, claims Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford - not William Shakespeare - wrote the plays.

Featuring a glittering cast including Rafe Spall as the Bard, Rhys Ifans as the Earl of Oxford and Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth I, the film carries the tagline ‘Was Shakespeare a fraud?’

But the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust said it wanted to highlight the damaging impact of the ‘conspiracy theory’ in claiming Shakespeare was the ‘barely literate frontman for the Earl of Oxford’.

Protesters at the Gower Shakespeare Memorial in Stratford town centre yesterday used a cherry picker to drape a massive 98ft by 98ft (30m) white sheet over a  statue of the playwright.   

They also covered street and pub signs displaying the writer’s name with black tape.

Amy O’Toole, who organised the protests, said: ‘We really want to highlight the issue that William Shakespeare was the true author of his work.

‘Hundreds of people are getting behind us and we have Shakespeare pubs up and down the country from Brighton to Edinburgh getting involved.

‘It’s great to create a talking point around the Bard but ultimately we want to dispel these myths.’

Dr Paul Edmondson, head of knowledge 
and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, said: ‘This film flies
in the face of a mass of historical fact.

‘There is a risk that people who have never questioned the authorship of Shakespeare’s works could be hoodwinked.

‘Shakespeare is at the core of England’s cultural and historical DNA, and he is certainly our most famous export.

Stephen Fry believes that William Shakespeare, a countryman, was the true author and has rubbished the film's claims

‘Today’s activity barely scratches 
the surface, but we hope it will remind people of the enormous legacy we
owe to William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon.’

However, Roland Emmerich, who also 
directed disaster movie ‘2012’, said: ‘To me there are many reasons to 
doubt the traditional attribution of the works of William Shakespeare to
the man from Stratford.

‘The points that strike me most are his signatures - all poorly executed and hardly a sign of true penmanship.

‘His detailed will that famously 
mentioned his second ‘best bed’ but failed to mention that the man from 
Stratford had a literary career

‘And why did nobody notice the great 
poet’s death in 1616, which was followed by complete silence? Also his 
two daughters were illiterate.’

Scholars and celebrities, including 
the Prince of Wales and Stephen Fry, have also got behind the Trust’s 
campaign to prove Shakespeare’s authenticity.

The Prince of Wales claimed Shakespeare must have been of significant standing to know so much about his royal characters.

He said: ‘Shakespeare’s company 
performed before Queen Elizabeth three or four times a year and at least
three times as often for King James.

‘It seems certain that Shakespeare and his king must have known each other well.’

Stephen Fry said: ‘There seems to be 
absolutely no doubt to anybody who reads Shakespeare and is familiar 
with the text that these are the works of a countryman.

‘This is a man who knows about kites 
and fields and is certainly not the work of an aristocrat. It just 
doesn’t ring true in any sense’
