House Speaker John Boehner today told fellow Republicans that his talks with President Barack Obama have stalled.

'The Senate needs to hold tough,' Representative Greg Walden said Boehner told House GOP lawmakers. 'The president now isn't negotiating with us.'

Obama rejected the speaker’s effort to lift the debt ceiling for six weeks and reopen government in exchange for a budget negotiating process.

Attention now turns to the Senate, where a bipartisan group of Senators are working on a separate plan to reopen the government.

Word of the negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and the top Republican, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, emerged as the Senate, as expected, rejected a Democratic effort to raise the government's borrowing limit through next year.

Republicans objected because they want the extension to be accompanied by spending cuts.

The calendar is edging closer to the October 17 deadline to raise the federal debt ceiling. After that, administration officials have said the government will deplete its ability to borrow money, risking a first-time federal default that could jolt the world economy.

GOP senators said the talks between Reid and McConnell had started Friday. That was confirmed by Senate Democratic aides.

'I was happy to see the Republicans engaged in talks with the president, the House Republicans. That’s over with. It’s done. They’re not talking anymore,' Reid said.

'I say to my friends on the Republican side of this Senate, time is running out.'

Saturday's Senate vote derailing the Democrats' debt-limit measure was a near party-line 53-45 in favor of the bill. That fell seven short of the 60 required to overcome Republican objections to considering the measure.

'The only thing that's happening right now is Senator Reid and Senator McConnell are talking. And I view that as progress,' said the second-ranking Republican senator, John Cornyn of Texas.

House conservatives said Obama was to blame for the talks with their chamber running aground.

'Perhaps he sees this as the best opportunity for him to win the House in 2014,' said Representative John Fleming. 'It's very clear to us he does not now, and never had, any intentions of negotiating.'

'It doesn't have to be this way. It's not supposed to be this way,' Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address Saturday.

'Manufacturing crises to extract massive concessions isn't how our democracy works, and we have to stop it. Politics is a battle of ideas, but you advance those ideas through elections and legislation - not extortion.'

A bipartisan group of senators, closely watched by Senate leaders, is polishing a plan aimed at reaching compromise with Obama.

An emerging proposal by Senator Susan Collins would reportedly fund the government 
through March, raise the debt ceiling through January, give federal 
agencies flexibility to manage across-the-board cuts caused by 
sequestration, and delay Obamacare's medical device tax by two years.

In the face of disastrous opinion polls, GOP leaders have signaled they will make sure the debt limit is increased with minimal damage to the financial markets. But they're still seeking concessions as a condition for reopening the government.

Obama met Senate Republicans on Friday and heard a pitch from Collins on raising the debt limit until the end of January, reopening the government and cutting the health care law at its periphery.

The plan also would strengthen income verification for people receiving subsidies through the health care law and set up a broader set of budget talks.

The Collins proposal would delay for two years a medical-device tax that helps finance the health care law, and it would subject millions of individuals eligible for subsidies to purchase health insurance under the program to stronger income verification.

Collins said Obama said the proposal 'was constructive, but I don't want to give the impression that he endorsed it.'
