Ukip’s immigration policy was left in chaos this morning after it rejected claims it wanted to repatriate foreign workers after leaving the EU – by promising an amnesty for all three million European migrants to stay in Britain.

Mark Reckless, the party’s candidate in tomorrow’s crunch Rochester by-election, sparked outrage after claiming that once Britain left the European Union migrants would only be allowed to stay for a ‘fixed period’.

But Ukip this morning insisted that 'there is no intention whatsoever to backdate future border controls to penalise those already here’. The u-turn means the 2.8million EU nationals living and working in Britain would be given the right to stay in the UK after an EU exit.

It comes after Mr Reckless refused to deny Ukip would look to deport a plumber from Poland who owned a home and had children at local schools he did not rule it out, but said this would be a case ‘we would look sympathetically at’.

Mr Reckless was addressing an audience of dozens of local residents at a hustings with other candidates in the Rochester and Strood by-election.

His remarks were met with jeers and the Labour candidate, PR consultant Naushabah Khan, whose father came from Pakistan in the 1980s and whose mother is Kenyan Asian, said: ‘Where would you stop Mark? My family are migrants, are we going to say they need to go back as well?’

Mr Reckless said British citizens would be able to stay but Ukip’s aim was that migration policy would be the same for EU member states as for other parts of the world.

Mr Reckless this morning attempted to clarify his remarks on immigration, after last night saying that people from the European Union who had settled in the UK should be granted leave to stay ‘for a fixed period’ only.

'I said we would give people from the EU who were already here, including such a Polish plumber, a work permit to allow him to stay.

'Anyone's who's here legally, under the current EU arrangements, we would want to ensure that they remained legally by issuing a work permit to anyone who was in that category already in the country. For new people coming in we'd apply a points-based system.'

A Ukip spokesman added: 'Ukip and Mark have always been completely clear on this. Do not believe the desperate last throw of the dice from the Conservative party.

'There is no intention whatsoever to backdate future border controls to penalise those already here.

'Mark simply made the absolutely common sense point that there will be a period after future border control arrangements have been agreed before they come into effect.’

But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Reckless had ‘let the mask slip’.

She said: ‘To hear the language of repatriation coming from someone they hope will be their second MP is shameful. It's a policy that comes straight out of the last BNP manifesto and does not reflect British values.

‘Be it Mark Reckless talking about repatriation, council candidates who attack Lenny Henry for the colour of his skin, or party thugs who overturn other parties' street stalls, nasty views are not far below the surface.’ 

Former home office minister Damian Green (pictured) said Mr Reckless had come ‘perilously close’ to a policy of repatriation and insisted his remarks were ‘totally unacceptable’

Ukip leader Nigel Farage’s wife is German. The party has never previously mentioned sending home settled migrants.

Damian Green, the Conservative MP for nearby Ashford, said: ‘This sounds perilously close to repatriation and however strongly people feel about immigration this kind of policy is completely unacceptable.’

The host of the debate, screened last night on ITV Meridian, asked Mr Reckless if a Polish plumber living in Rochester would have to return home if Britain left the European Union.

Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant (pictured) said 'jaws dropped' when the comment was made

He replied: ‘I think in the near term we’d have to have a transitional period, we should probably allow people who are currently here to have a work permit at least for a fixed period.’

Mr Reckless added before being cut off by jeering: ‘People who have been here a long time and integrated in that way I think we’d want to look sympathetically at.

‘What we would want to do is…apply a consistent Australian-style points system, the same to people coming from Europe as we do to those coming from say the Commonwealth, from Australia, Africa, India, the Caribbean, we shouldn’t have a discriminatory system which favours Europeans.’

Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant, who attended the debate said: ‘Jaws dropped on the floor when he said it. They are advocating repatriation, but it’s not clear of whom.

‘It sounds like a kangaroo court of Ukip officials would decide who stays and who goes. This shows how dangerous ill-thought out populism can be.’

Mr Reckless is on course to win the Kent seat, with polls putting his party around 15 points ahead of the Conservatives.

The Tory candidate, 36-year-old marine surveyor Kelly Tolhurst, has also put immigration at the top of her six-point plan for the area. 

In one of her campaign leaflets she wrote that she had ‘seen the negative impact of uncontrolled immigration’ in the constituency, and said she had told the Prime Minister: ‘We need action, not just talk.’

Three Conservative MPs are holding ballots about European Union membership that are almost identical to those carried out by two Ukip defectors.

Peter Bone, MP for Wellingborough, Philip Hollobone, of Kettering, and Martin Vickers, of Cleethorpes, are asking constituents whether they want to be in or out of the EU. Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless conducted similar exercises before defecting.

They are all thought to have been advised by anti-EU campaigner Chris Bruni-Lowe, who has long-standing links with Ukip. 

Mr Bone said ‘private donors’ were funding his referendum and that his original leaflet was a ‘crib of the one Mark Reckless did’.

All three MPs firmly denied any intention to defect. Mr Bone joked: ‘I haven’t even been invited to lunch [by Ukip].’

Mr Vickers said there was ‘absolutely no way’ that he would switch to Ukip.

But the revelation will heighten Tory jitters ahead of Thursday's Rochester and Strood by-election.
