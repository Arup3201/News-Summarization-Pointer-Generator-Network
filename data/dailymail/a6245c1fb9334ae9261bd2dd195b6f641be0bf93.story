Police have named a man killed in a shooting that also left his partner with serious injuries.

Dothan Gordon, 32, was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting in Ealing, west London, despite the efforts of London Ambulance Service paramedics who tried to save him.

A post-mortem examination confirmed the cause of death as being a gunshot wound.

His 28-year-old partner also suffered
gunshot injuries. She was taken to a west London hospital where she is 
being treated for a shoulder injury, and was described today as being in
a stable condition.

Police
have launched a murder inquiry but no arrests have been made. Scotland 
Yard are still trying to establish the circumstances of the shooting, 
which happened at 2.50pm on June 20 at a residential address in Glenpark
Court, Felix Road.

An ambulance spokesperson said: 'We sent two ambulance crews, a single responder in a car, London’s air ambulance and one duty manager to the scene.

'Sadly,
despite our best efforts, one patient died at the scene. A second 
patient, who is a female with a shoulder injury, was taken to hospital 
as a priority.'

Felix Road,
a quiet terraced street where flats go for around £170,000, was 
immediately cordoned off and parents were taken by police escort to pick
up their children from St John's Primary School, near where the 
shooting took place.

A parent described how she walked past the scene with her three-year-old son minutes before the incident happened.

She
said: 'I was on my way to Waitrose and I walked down Felix Road. As 
soon as I was in Waitrose that's when the police arrived, so I must just
have missed it.

'The police stopped right outside the school. All of the kids were looking out of the window.

'It
was just before the end of the school day so when the parents came to 
pick their children up they couldn't get to them because of the police 
cordon.

'They were going to start escorting parents into the school to collect their children.'

She added: 'It's really scary. I was on that side of the road with my young son just moments before. It really is shocking.'
