The son of a London nightclub tycoon appeared in court today charged with his murder.

David West, 44, appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged with the murder of his father, also called David West.

The 70-year-old, a flamboyant self-styled ‘lord’, died of a single knife wound at his £2.5million home in Mayfair, central London, on Friday.

His son was charged with his murder after allegedly stabbing him in a drunken row.

Stephen Fry said he heard ‘horrifying screams’ as his nightclub boss neighbour was killed.

Mr West was a self-styled lord who reportedly owned the nightclub Hey Jo, as well as Abracadabra, a restaurant which specialises in Russian cuisine. Both are located close to his home.

He has been described as a flamboyant figure and is said to have bought the title of “Lord of the Manor of Hollesley” on eBay.

He made his fortune selling alcohol from a Calais warehouse called Eastenders, having started in business selling flowers and groceries from a stall in Romford market in east London.

In 2007 he made headlines after he hired Cherie Blair to mount a legal challenge against the smoking ban.

West Jr appeared in Westminster Magistrates' Court today and only spoke to confirm his name, date of birth, and address during the minute long hearing.

He stood in the dock wearing  grey woollen tracksuit bottoms and a grey jumper and showed no emotion during the hearing.

The brown-haired West Jr's right hand was in a cast and he looked dishevelled and unshaven. 

He nodded towards of a group of friends who sat in the public gallery, all of whom were smartly dressed in formal business attire. 

District judge Margot Coleman referred the case to Old Bailey, where it will be heard on Wednesday.

The divorced father of three, who bought the title ‘Lord of the Manor of Hollesley’ on eBay, worked closely with his son David until his death.

Police were called to a building where the men lived in adjacent flats at 6pm on Friday. West Jr was arrested nearby.

Comedian Fry, 57, told The Sun reporters Tom Morgan and Shaun Wooller last night: ‘I was at home on Friday night when I heard these horrifying screams and wondered what was going on.

‘I looked out the window and saw Dave’s body taken out of his home and placed on the road. The emergency services were desperately trying to revive him but were unfortunately unable to do so.’

Yesterday friends paid tribute to the man dubbed ‘king of the booze cruise’ who made millions flogging £1-a-bottle wine and cigarettes to coaches of Brits.

A post-mortem examination revealed that a single stab wound was the cause of Mr West's death

The cockney, known for his £5,000 Italian pink suits, mullet haircut and crocodile skin shoes, rose from barrow boy to head a £100million empire and once tried to sue David and Victoria Beckham for slander for saying he was not welcome at their World Cup party despite paying £100,000 for a ticket.

West said they did not want him at the 2006 ball, banned him from carrying a mobile phone and told him his pink suit was against the dress code. A High Court judge threw out the case, however.

A year later, he hired barrister Cherie Blair to fight the public smoking ban – then a flagship policy of her husband Tony Blair’s government. 

The prime minister’s wife was taken to West’s erotic nightclub Hey Jo, named after his 21-year-old girlfriend Joanna Dudzik – who he lavished £400,000 on, then took to the High Court to try to curb her spending. 

Mrs Blair’s tour of the £4million club, with its explicit decor, ‘bondage booth’ and waitresses dressed as nurses, caused a sensation. 

The pensioner, originally from Romford, Essex, started his career as a market trader in the East End

Traces of polonium-210 were later found in the club after two ex-KGB agents wanted for the murder of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko visited in 2007.

West, from Romford, Essex, started as an East End market trader before he and his wife Kathy opened greasy spoon cafes in Belgium and Calais. His firm, EastEnders, became part of Europe’s largest British-owned cash-and-carry group – with its own wine label, The Dogs B*******.

His 30-year marriage failed in 1999 when he took up with a 23-year-old French blonde, quickly followed by a series of young girlfriends. West admitted trawling Russian bride websites and at one stage shared his flat with three Estonian girls.

He ran a talent firm, a restaurant called Abracadabra and a Mayfair lapdancing club, Puss In Boots. He also owned 4 Star Hostel, a women’s guesthouse near Piccadilly Circus, and gentlemen’s club Mandy’s.

Last night his business associate Harry Barnett, 72, who was friends with West for 60 years, said: ‘I can’t believe it. They were very close.

As well as HeyJo (pictured) he also is believed to have owned a gentleman's club called Mandy's

Mr West lived in a three-bedroom house in Ormond Yard, where police and paramedics were called on Friday

‘Dave lived with his dad all his life, apart from when he was married. It’s his other son, James, I feel for now. He is in bits.’

At his home in Brentwood, Essex, West’s youngest son James said: ‘We want to keep it a private matter.’

West once said of his children: ‘I gave them some money – enough to start their own businesses – and waved them off.

‘They drive the flash cars and wear all the trendy designer gear, but I have to hope we’ve brought them up right. The best thing in the world would be for me to see them making a go of a business. It’s all I ever wanted, and it’s all I’ve ever done.’

Last night friends remembered West online. Mickey Helliet said: ‘Really going to miss him, a real character.’ Jelena Gauthier said: ‘Such a gracious host, flamboyant man and a playful soul.’

Alex Mills, who starred in The Apprentice last year, tweeted: ‘Terribly sad news.’
