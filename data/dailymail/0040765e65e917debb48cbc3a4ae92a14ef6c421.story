A Tory MP has questioned how Benefits Street 'star' White Dee can make repeated live television appearances while she is unable to work because she is depressed.

The unemployed single mother-of-two was accused of being 'bone idle' today after she was interviewed by Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on ITV's This Morning.

The 42-year-old appeared to have had her hair coloured and put make-up on before appearing on the show.

White Dee - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly - went on the show just two days after she appeared on Channel 4's Benefits Britain: The Live Debate.

There have also been rumours that she is being lined up to appear on Celebrity Big Brother which will net her a minimum fee of £60,000.

The 42-year-old insists that she has been unable to work since her mother died because she has been suffering from depression.

She said in a recent interview on Channel 5: 'I haven't been on benefits my whole life. At the moment I am not in a place where (I can work). I suffer with depression and I am being assessed for bipolar disorder.

Controversy: Critics have questioned whether White Dee is really unable to work. However, mental health charities have said that depression is not always obvious

Benefits row: Tory MP Philip Davies today accused White Dee of being 'bone idle'

'I have a good day, I have three bad days
 and then I have two good days. What sort of employer would I ring up 
and say "sorry I can't come in for three days - I'm low".'

Conservative MP Philip Davies accused White Dee of not being interested in finding a job.

‘If the people from Benefits Street are going to make these public appearances hopefully they are going to be paid for it so the taxpayer can get some of their money back,' he said.

‘I think every time people look at White Dee make an appearance hopefully it will serve as a reminder to people of the mess the benefits system is in and how badly Iain Duncan Smith’s reforms are needed.

‘White Dee is bone idle and doesn’t want to work another day in her life and has no intention of finding a job. She expects the taxpayer to fund her life on benefits.

‘The only person who should be depressed is the taxpayer who has to pick up the bill.’

Mr Davies spoke out today as separate figures revealed 800,000 people on Jobseeker's Allowance have had their benefits suspended because they had not done enough to find work.

White Dee admitted that she receives 'about £200 per week' in state handouts to live off.

The money she receives consists of child tax credits, child benefit and Employment Support Allowance (ESA).

As a mother-of-two, she receives £20.30 per week for her first child 16-year-old Caitlin plus £13.40 for her second child Gerrard, aged seven.

Claim form: White Dee will have to have filled out an 56-page form like this before she can claim benefits for depression

She is also eligible to receive £5,995 per year in child tax credits - which works out as £115 per week.

Finally she receives ESA, which is paid to people who are sick. White Dee could receive up to £100.15 per week. However, this can be reduced if the individual does not attend support group sessions.

In order to qualify for the ESA, she would have had to fill out A 56-page form giving full details of her medical condition.

One of the questions on the form asks: 'Do you know when you will be well enough to work again? Yes or No'.

Questions: One of the questions on the 56-page form is 'do you know when you will be well enough to work again?'

Claimants are required to give brief details of their illness plus provide contact details for the doctor who signs off their medical statements.

Once the form is submitted, White Dee will have been assessed by workers from Atos who would have ruled that she is unfit to work because of her depression.

White Dee has insisted that depression means she cannot work - because she would be forced to take regular days off sick.

During a recent television interview on Channel 5, she said: 'I haven't been on benefits my whole life. At the moment I am not in a place where (I can work). I suffer with depression and I am being assessed for bipolar disorder.

'I have a good day, I have three bad days and then I have two good days. What sort of employer would I ring up and say "sorry I can't come in for three days - I'm low". I would prefer to be working.'

More than 800,000 people have had their Jobseeker's Allowance payments suspended by the government because they are not doing enough to look for work, new figures revealed today.

Tough new rules were introduced in October 2012 as ministers made it clear what claimants had to do in return for their benefits.

Payments have been suspended a total of 818,000 times since then if claimants failed to attend an appointment, rejected a job offer or were not doing enough to find work.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'This Government has always been clear that in return for claiming unemployment benefits jobseekers have a responsibility to do everything they can to get back into work.

'As part of the Government’s long-term economic plan, we are ending the something for nothing culture and supporting those who want to work hard and play by the rules.'

'People who are in a job know that if they don’t play by the rules or fail to turn up in the morning, there might be consequences, so it’s only right that people on benefits should have similar responsibilities.

'Sanctions are used as a last resort, but it’s only right that there is a penalty if people fail to play by them.'

White Dee has revealed she receives around £200 a week in handouts which consist of Employment Support Allowance (ESA) because of her condition, child benefit and child tax credits.

In order to get her ESA benefits for 
depression, White Dee will have been assessed by Atos workers who would 
have signed her off as unfit to work. During the process, she may have 
provided a GP's note confirming that she is sick.

As a mother-of two she is entitled to £33.70 child benefit per week, a maximum of £100.15 ESA payments because she is 'depressed', plus £115 per week child tax credits.

The Benefits Street matriarch has been living off handouts after being sacked from her job as a council administrator seven years ago. She narrowly avoided prison after being caught stealing £13,000.

Speaking on This Morning today, she said that although she appeared jovial on screen, Channel 4 did not do enough to show how bad her condition is.

She said: 'It's a horrible stigma, depression - just because you suffer from depression, you don't suffer from it twenty four hours a day. They (Channel 4) were let into the house when I was sleeping, so they did see both sides of it. And in reality they could have put more of that out.'

She added: 'It started off as a bereavement depression when I lost my mum - the most important person in my life - was just gone.'

The mother, who has children Gerrard,
 seven, and Caitlin, 16, also said that she appeared on Benefits Street 
thinking it was going to show off the community spirit in James Turner 
Street where she lives.

'I think we went into it very naively to be honest,' she said.

'Obviously
 we went into it believing it was community spirit - I know people are 
probably sick of hearing us say that now - but we were told that how we 
live were how children used to live years ago, where they could all play
 out together, where we all helped each other, when someone is ill, 
someone else looks after their children.'

She appeared on television today after accusing Channel 4 of 'manipulating' her and her neighbours during a live television debate on Monday.

She said: 'You (Channel 4) spent up to 18 months, up to two years, to film people that were working, you filmed old age pensioners, you came to parties, you filmed open days, community spirit and boom (you showed)... five of us.'

The single mother - who chewed gum during the live show - added that on-screen life on handouts was made to look like fun.

'It looks great, it looks like a right barrel of laughs. It looks like you are having a great crack,' she said.

'Obviously it is just a programme that they put together into 40 minutes that they had spent 18 months filming.'

Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity SANE, said that people with depression have good days and bad days.

'Mental illnesses like depression can fluctuate from day to day and the current way people are being assessed for benefits takes no account of the reality of these conditions,' she said.

'Our own experience at SANE is that most people with depression really want to work. But they are simply unable to take the stress of a full working week to overcome the exhaustion and debilitation which are symptoms of the illness.

'White Dee is right that this makes it exceptionally difficult for employers and potential employees who may not be able to fulfil the demands of a full working week. We need a benefits system flexible enough to protect both.'
