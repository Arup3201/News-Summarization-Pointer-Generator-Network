The Jackson family is at war over the medical treatment of Michael’s daughter Paris following her suicide attempt.

The 15-year-old girl is still in a psychiatric hospital nearly three months after taking a drug overdose.

Her uncle Randy, 51, declared on Twitter: ‘She is not psychotic.

‘There is no reason for her to be in a psychiatric hospital this long away from her family.’

Randy, Michael’s younger brother, tweeted that his niece had been in the facility for ‘far too long’ and said he hated the fact that she would probably still be away for her father’s birthday on August 29.

‘There’s something more to this there’s something going on I don’t like it I’m afraid for her,’ he wrote in a separate note.

Paris’s mother Debbie Rowe last night claimed Randy didn’t know what he was talking about.

‘As usual, he’s grossly misinformed,’ she is reported saying. ‘He doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He has no idea where she is. She’s not in a psychiatric hospital.’

Randy assured his Twitter followers that he would ‘look into this’.

But he doesn’t have any official say in the teenager’s care and neither does Miss Rowe.

Michael’s
 mother, Katherine, 83, and nephew, TJ Jackson, are the guardians of 
Paris and her brothers Prince, 16, and Blanket, 11. The family is 
keeping the Los Angeles area facility where Paris is being treated a 
secret.

'Grossly misinformed': Paris's mother Debbie Rowe says Randy Jackson has no idea about her daughter's state of health

She slit a wrist and took an overdose of painkillers on June 5. After she was hospitalised, Kevin Boyle, a lawyer for her grandmother, said: ‘Being a sensitive 15-year-old is difficult no matter who you are. It is especially difficult when you lose the person closest to you. Paris is physically fine and is getting appropriate medical attention.’

A week ago, Miss Rowe testified on the effect that Michael Jackson’s death in June 2009 had had on Paris. Miss Rowe, mother of Michael’s two older children, was speaking at the Jackson wrongful death trial.

Michael’s family are suing AEG Live, the promoter of his doomed comeback concerts, for £26.5billion. They claim AEG was negligent in hiring Conrad Murray, the star’s personal doctor.

Miss Rowe broke down in the witness box, saying: ‘Their father is dead. I almost lost my daughter!

‘She is devastated. She tried to kill herself. She doesn’t feel she has a life any more.’

The trial, which is not expected to finish until next month, is said to have put added strain on Paris.

Murray is now serving a four-year sentence for involuntarily manslaughter over the singer’s death.
