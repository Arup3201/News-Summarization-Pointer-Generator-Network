It was the middle of the night in the small rural town of Bedford, Iowa when an escaped convict broke into a couple's home.

Rodney Long, 38, wandered through the house of Jerome, 71, and Carolyn Mauderly, 66, as they slept in their bedroom on Monday night.

Shot and killed: Rodney Eugene Long, 38. He was killed by a rural Bedford homeowner who said the armed man broke into his house

Long who was armed with a semi-automatic handgun, was a wanted man after shooting and injuring a police officer on Sunday night, triggering a 40 minute chase and a massive manhunt.

Police
ran a number of searches of the home on Monday morning as they looked 
for Long, but it wasn't until Monday night when he finally surfaced, 
breaking into the small one-storey house.

The
Mauderlys were held hostage in their own bedroom and Long, brandishing a rifle, paraded about the place. He even took the time to call someone, although 
police won't say who.

After 
four hours of being held captive, Mr Mauderly, who kept a shotgun in the
house, decided that he was going to do something. about the situation.

Like many other Bedford residents, the Mauderlys had armed themselves in the days since Long’s prison escape.

'Several members of the community if not everybody went to bed or was armed in some fashion in their immediate surroundings, is what we’ve heard from the public,' said special agent in charge Mitch Mortvedt.

Armed: Less than 1,500 people live in the small town of Bedford. Some residents left whilst Long was on the loose, whilst others armed themselves and kept guns by their beds

'As the situation wore on, a decision was made by the Mauderlys that they were going to defend themselves,'  he said during a news conference.

Somehow, although officials have not said how exactly, Jerome Mauderly was able to grab hold of his gun and shoot Long.

Police were on scene almost immediately and found him laying face down with a single gun shot wound.

The Mauderlys were uninjured.

Long, who is originally from southeast Iowa, was serving time for third-degree burglary.

He was sentenced earlier this year and was due to be released in September 2014.

On the run: Authorities say Long, an escaped inmate, shot a southwest Iowa sheriff's deputy

Officials said Long’s past offenses were all non-violent, and they are unaware of him having any mental issues.

After Long had escaped, the town had waited for his capture with a mixture of apprehension and fear.

Numerous Bedford residents armed themselves in the days since Long’s prison escape.

Mick Ware, 68, told the Des Moines register that some community members left town because they were too scared to remain.

He described the Mauderlys as 'good people, common people. They just work hard.'

He also called Jerome Mauderly, who is the deacon in his local church, a hero.

'The community is grateful, law enforcement is grateful, because this risk is gone,' Mr Ware said.
