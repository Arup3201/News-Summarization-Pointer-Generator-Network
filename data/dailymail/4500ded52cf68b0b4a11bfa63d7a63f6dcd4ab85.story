Beloved Caretaker: Hadassah Peri earned unspeakable riches working as heiress Huguette Clark's nurse for 20 years

She may look like a typical nurse seen on the wards of any American hospital.

But this is the reclusive Hadassah Peri who is set to inherit a staggering $33million from the famed New York copper heiress Huguette Clark.

It is the first time the Filipino-born mother has been spotted in public since the news broke of her amazing windfall after the death of secretive Miss Clark in June at the age of 104.

The heiress had not been seen in 70 years and spent her time in her sprawling apartment block on New York's Fifth Avenue.

There she was tended to for 20 years by Mrs Peri after the nurse was randomly assigned to her by an agency in the 1990s.

Mrs  Peri earned $131,000 per annum working for the reclusive Ms Clark, who died at the age of 104 with a $400million fortune.

The 61-year-old nurse’s 2001 Bentley Arnage sedan cost  $204,000, and her Lincoln Navigator SUV was around $42,000.

The mother of three lives in luxury with her husband, with a total of five properties to her name.

They include a three-story brick home in
 Manhattan Beach, complete with a swan-filled canal, and a $500,000 
beach house on an exclusive strip of the Jersey Shore.

It is an amazing existence for the Filipno woman who emigrated to the US in 1972.

But her American dream began when she landed the job with Miss Clark, whose fortune was founded on her father's Montana copper empire.

Miss Clark was born in Paris in 1906, the youngest child of U.S. Senator William Andrews Clark, who was known as one of the copper kings.

He was America's second richest man in the early 1900s behind John D Rockefeller.

He shocked the political and financial world when he was 62 by announcing he had secretly married two years earlier and that his 23-year-old wife already had a two-year-old daughter.

Miss Clark became the subject of public fascination and an investigation after a century of life as a recluse. The last photograph was taken of her more than 80 years ago.

Heiress: Huguette Clark doted upon her nurse, paying her six-figure wages. In her will, she left Mrs Peri with $33.6 million of her fortune

She was married in 1928, at 22, to 
William Gower, a law student and Clark family employee. The couple soon 
separated, had no children, and divorced in less than two years, in the 
summer of 1930.

When Senator Clark died, his millions
 were divided equally between his children from both his marriages. When
 Huguette turned 21, she received $300million or $3.6billion in today's 
money.

But that money is now at the centre 
of a lengthy court battle as New York lawyers examine the management of 
of Miss Clark's fortune, which had dwindled to $400million by the time 
of her death, by lawyer Wallace Bock, 79, and accountant Irving Kamsler,
 64.

Court documents released at the 
weekend revealed that amazing details of the millionairess's lifestyle 
including a bottomless $43m checking account.

The records show $126.3million was spent by her attorney and accountant from her accounts over 15 years.

A total of $2.5million was paid to a famous French doll house, as the heiress filled her home with the delicate figurines.

Another doll auction company received 21 payments between 1997 to 2009, totaling $729,000.

A total of $380,000 in cheques was spent on November 16, 2009, written by either by Mr Bock or Mr Kamsler from Miss Clark's personal account, including written out to her doctor for $50,000, Mrs Peri and her husband, each for $60,000.

Various nurses and personal assistants also got massive sums, msnbc.com reports.

Mr Kamsler was not left out. He received a cheque for $60,000, and three weeks later, so did Mr Bock.

In later years, a large sum of money went to cover her ailing health. Beth Israel, which housed Miss Clark for years, received $4.9million for her care between December 1997 and February 2011.

Miss Clark's closet friend outside of Mrs Peri was Suzanne Pierre, the widow of her physician. Mrs Pierre would often serve as her social secretary and get regular payments of around $50,000. In all, she was paid $1.7million.

Mrs Pierre was also gifted with $10million in 2000. She died only weeks before Miss Clarke.

According to court documents obtained by the New York Post, Mrs Peri was given an astounding $5 million bonus in February 2009.

Mrs Peri is also said 
to have been able to afford another guest house in Brooklyn from 
her salary where her relatives stay when they’re in town.

In August 1999, she was given a single payment of $133,950 for undisclosed reasons.

She also stands to inherit $33.6 million once Miss Clark’s will is cleared in court, as well as the priceless doll collection.

Though Mrs Peri would not herself 
comment on the riches she obtained from working for the centenarian 
heiress, her spokesman told the New York Post: ‘Miss Clark was a very 
generous woman.’

According to recent salary reports, the average remuneration for a private nurse is $65,000.

Miss Clark cared deeply for her nurse, and would call Mrs Peri each night to wish her sweet dreams.

Generous: The money was also used to secure two places for her children at this posh Manhattan apartment complex

But the heiress wasn’t only fond of Mrs 
Peri. She doted upon Mrs Peri’s three children and spared them the 
experience of New York City dorm life by instead securing two lavish Upper East
 Side condos for university.

In a statement released after Miss 
Clark’s death, Mrs Peri said she cared for the heiress every day for 20 
years. ‘I was her private duty nurse but also her close friend. I knew 
her as a kind and generous person, with whom I shared many wonderful 
moments and whom I loved very much.’

Miss Clark died at the age of 104 in May.

She hadn’t been seen in public for some 70 years, and only left her sprawling 42-room Fifth Avenue apartment to go to doctor’s appointments.

Her New York apartment is believed to
 have a 30ft library, a 40ft drawing room and 40ft living room as well 
as stunning views of Central Park.

It has 42 rooms covering 15,000 square feet in total.

She also owned properties in California and Connecticut, which she never visited and lay empty for nearly 60 years.

Ms Clark was buried at her family's 
mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, where the only people present 
were funeral home employees.

All other family members had been banned.

Investigations into Ms Clark’s estate are currently underway, both by the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general.

It is widely believed Mr Bock wrongly accepted large sums of money and gifts from Ms Clark, as well as mismanaging her fortune.
