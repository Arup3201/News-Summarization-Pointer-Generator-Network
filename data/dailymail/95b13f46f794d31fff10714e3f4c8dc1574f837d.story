A traditional Christmas roast dinner with turkey, gravy, sprouts and pudding is what many look forward to the most on December 25th.

However, should you find yourself short of time or more interested in playing video games than cooking, a canned version of all you could want for a festive feast has been developed.

The Christmas Tinner has nine layers, starting from the top with eggs and bacon for breakfast, followed by turkey with all the trimmings, and finished off with Christmas pudding.

The canned Christmas feast is designed to cater to the thousands of Britons who struggle to tear themselves from their consoles to sit down for dinner on December 25th.

Research has revealed that nearly half of British console fans are planning on spending a majority of Christmas Day playing their new games, much to the joy of their family members.

Nearly a third of gamers admitted to having been late or cut Christmas dinner short in the past in order to carry on playing.

In response, retailer GAME paired up with designer Chris Godfrey to create the Christmas Tinner to ensure that gamers’s rumbling stomachs are covered from dawn to dusk, all in one handy can.

'The Christmas Tinner is our gifting solution combining the best of both worlds: so gamers can feast on the latest releases and the finest food at the same time,’ Ailsa McKnight, Marketing Director of GAME Retail Ltd, said.

The nine layers of Christmas:

Each of the nine layers represents a part of the traditional Christmas feast, starting with a hearty scrambled eggs and bacon breakfast.

The roast dinner that follows leaves nothing off the list, with a turkey and potato layer followed by gravy, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, Brussels sprouts, stuffing and roast carrots and parsnips.

Sprout haters need not worry, GAME has also developed a ‘Without Sprouts Tinner' to cover all tastes.

To create the Christmas Tinner, designer Chris Godfrey processed the food and sealed it with gelatine, placing each layer in the tin one at a time. All the gamer has to do is open and eat.

‘I tried to ensure when creating the menu that all the flavours complemented one another and it was designed so that gamers can eat one layer at a time, starting with breakfast and finishing off with Christmas Pudding – the perfect Christmas Day meal without any of the fuss,’ designer Chris Godfrey said.

After receiving full approval from testers at GAME’s store in Basingstoke, Hampshire, the company is now considering putting the Christmas Tinner in production if there is enough ‘gamer demand’.
