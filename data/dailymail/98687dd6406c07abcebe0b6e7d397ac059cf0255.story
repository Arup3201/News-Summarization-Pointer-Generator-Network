National Security Agency spies have been tracking the online sexual activity of suspected terrorists in a bid to expose them as hypocrites, it emerged today.

A top secret document revealed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden shows the agency monitored suspected radicalizers in a bid to harm their reputations.

Six 
targets, all Muslims, are identified as 'exemplars' of how electronic surveillance can be used to find 'personal vulnerabilities' to discredit them.

The document revealed by Edward Snowdon says evidence of 'viewing sexually explicit material online' could call into question a radicaliser's devotion to the jihadist cause

The document says none of the six individuals targeted by the NSA is accused of being involved in terror plots and all are believed to currently reside outside the U.S.

Among
the vulnerabilities listed by the NSA that can be exploited
are 'viewing sexually explicit material online' and 'using sexually 
explicit persuasive language when communicating with inexperienced young
girls'.

The
NSA document, dated October 3, 2012, repeatedly refers to the power of 
charges of hypocrisy to undermine such a messenger, the The Huffington Post reported.

The document says: 'A previous SIGINT [signals intelligence, the interception of communications] assessment report on radicalization indicated that radicalizers appear 
to be particularly vulnerable in the area of authority when their 
private and public behaviors are not consistent.'

The
director of the National Security Agency is
listed as the 'originator' of the document which 
lists recipients including officials at the U.S. Departments of Justice and 
Commerce and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Shawn Turner, director of public affairs
for National Intelligence, told The Huffington Post: 'Without
discussing specific individuals, it should not be surprising that the 
US Government uses all of the lawful tools at our disposal to impede the
efforts of valid terrorist targets who seek to harm the nation and 
radicalize others to violence.'

But civil liberties campaigners have voiced concerns about the revelations.

Jameel 
Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, 
said: 'It's 
important to remember that the NSA’s surveillance activities are 
anything but narrowly focused - the agency is collecting massive 
amounts of sensitive information about virtually everyone.'

'Wherever
you are, the NSA's databases store information about your political 
views, your medical history, your intimate relationships and your 
activities online,' he added.

'The NSA says this personal information 
won't be abused, but these documents show that the NSA probably defines 
'abuse' very narrowly.'

None
of the six individuals targeted by the NSA is accused in the document 
of being involved in terror plots and all are believed to 
currently reside outside the U.S..

Only one is described as a 'U.S. person,' which means he is either a U.S. citizen or a
permanent resident and therefore entitled to greater legal 
protections against NSA surveillance than foreigners.

The NSA accuses two of the 
targets of promoting Al Qaeda propaganda, but states that surveillance 
of the three English-speakers' communications revealed that they have 
'minimal terrorist contacts.'

The
document claims three Arabic-speaking targets have more 
contacts with affiliates of extremist groups, but does not suggest they 
themselves are involved in any terror plots.

The
NSA possesses embarrassing sexually explicit information about at least
two of the targets by virtue of electronic surveillance of their online
activity.

The report states that some of the data was gleaned through 
FBI surveillance programs carried out under the Foreign Intelligence and
Surveillance Act.

According
to the document, the NSA believes that exploiting electronic 
surveillance to publicly reveal online sexual activities can make it 
harder for these “radicalizers” to maintain their credibility.

'Focusing
on access reveals potential vulnerabilities that could be even more 
effectively exploited when used in combination with vulnerabilities of 
character or credibility, or both, of the message in order to shape the 
perception of the messenger as well as that of his followers,' the 
document argues.
