Britain faces paying an extra £770million to Brussels this year after being outvoted by other members of the European Union.

David Cameron had vowed to take the axe to the EU budget for future years and oppose ‘unjustified’ increase demanded for this year.

But the UK was outnumbered when finance ministers from across the EU backed a plan to increase the budget by £6.2billion.

It means governments imposing austerity across will have to find millions more to hand over to Brussels, including £770million for the UK.

It is a major setback for Mr Cameron at a time when he is under pressure over his promise to hold an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.

The Prime Minister is adamant that he can renegotiate a new deal with Brussels, before putting it to a nationwide vote.

But he was unable to stop the new raid on national budgets to plug a shortfall in the EU to settle unpaid bills. It means the UK will pay a total of £14.7 billion this year.

Conservative MEP and former European Commission chief accountant Marta Andreasen said yesterday that it ‘made a joke’ of the recent budget agreement and ‘sets a terrible precedent.’

She said: ‘It seems bizarre to me that Germany, renowned for its strict approach to finances now wants to reward EU institutions who throw taxpayers’ cash around like confetti, with an initial 7.3bn euro (£6.1bn) top up and more to come.

‘When the European Commission can snap its fingers at complaint MEPs and finance ministers and instantly obtain vast amounts of cash it sets a terrible precedent…what isn’t funny is the price to be paid by this action. European citizens already suffering harsh austerity, will once more have to pick up the bill.’

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the result was a 'huge defeat' for David Cameron

The UK government expressed its dismay at the decision to press ahead with the rise.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘When countries and citizens across Europe are having to make difficult decisions with their budgets, Europe itself should practice what it preaches with its own budget," said a Treasury spokesman.

‘This amendment was unjustified, which is why Britain opposed it.’

Only Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Austria backed Britain in trying to oppose the budget rise. But Germany and France withdrew opposition.

Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, said: ‘What timing, what irony. On the day Cameron is offering a meaningless promise of a referendum, he gets an iron fisted rejection from Brussels.

‘This is another huge defeat for him at EU level, and shows the possibility of EU reform is non-existent. Lets face the facts, the only way is out.’
