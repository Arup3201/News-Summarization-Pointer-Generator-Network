Pressure for change came after Indian dentist Savita Halappanavar died after being denied an abortion

The Irish Government has passed landmark legislation today to allow abortion in the country in certain circumstances.

The laws enshrine a woman's right to a termination if her 
life is at risk, including if she is at risk of taking her own life.

The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013 was passed comfortably at about 12.30am today after a second late night of debates, with 127 members of the Dail parliament voting in favour and just 31 against.

Pressure to amend Ireland's strict 
abortion laws came after a backlash following the death of Indian 
dentist Savita Halappanavar, who died in an Irish hospital last year 
after being denied an abortion.

She was miscarrying 17 weeks into her pregnancy in October but doctors would not terminate the pregnancy.

Her
 widower Praveen claimed the couple had been told a termination was not 
allowed because 'Ireland is a Catholic country', prompting a worldwide 
outcry.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny said it was time the women of Ireland have the rights they deserve enshrined in law.

The
 bill was passed as it was revealed yesterday that 11 women travelled 
from Ireland to Britain every day for an abortion last year.

'We had 21 years of inaction, 21 years of inaction,' Mr Kenny said.

'What's going on here is medical clarity and legal certainty for the women of our country who have had a constitutional right conferred upon them.'

Mr Kenny, a devout Catholic, had been threatened with excommunication by bishops as the controversial lawÂ  travelled through the Houses of the Oireachtas.

The two-day debate wrapped up with the final vote shortly before 12.30am and one minister resigned following the decision.

Minister for European Affairs Lucinda
 Creighton resigned and automatically lost the party whip after voting 
against the Government in support of an amendment to the Bill.

She wanted to change the rule that 
allowed expectant mothers to seek an abortion on the grounds that she is
 prepared to take her own life.

She had called for alternative therapies to be offered instead but her demands were ignored.

'I'm very sad,' Ms Creighton said, after casting the vote that sealed her self-imposed exile.

'But
 at the same time I feel a bit relieved because this is obviously 
something that's been weighing on everybody's minds for months and 
months.'

She became the 
fifth Fine Gael TD to be expelled over the contentious legislation, 
after four colleagues voted against the Government in an earlier round 
of votes.

The High Court had earlier rejected a last minute attempt to secure an 
injunction against the legislation on the grounds that politicians have 
no right to vote on a bill that contains two provisions that have been 
previously put to the Irish people in referenda and rejected.

Pro-life activists had spent the past 48 hours outside Leinster House, praying beside pro-choice campaigners, some of whom waved placards 
with Mrs Halappanavar's face.

An
 inquiry found medics in University Hospital Galway missed an early 
opportunity to terminate her pregnancy on health grounds and 
unacceptable clinical practice.

The
 case sparked massive debate among obstetricians and politicians over 
whether the guidelines medics had been operating under were clear.

Campaigners
 have also pressed for abortion to be allowed in other circumstances, 
such as fatal foetal abnormalities, but were told that it would not be 
included.

The legislation follows a 1992 
judgment by the Supreme Court in Dublin, known as the X case, where 
judges ruled that abortion should be allowed if there was a threat to 
the mother's life, including suicide.

The
 case was taken by a 14-year-old rape victim who became pregnant and was
 refused permission by Irish authorities to travel to the UK for an 
abortion.

Ireland was also 
under pressure after a European Court of Human Rights ruling that a 
woman in remission with cancer was discriminated against because she was
 forced to travel overseas for a termination.

The
 Fine Gael-Labour coalition government is the first in the 21 years 
since the X case to attempt to pass legislation on abortion.

The bill will next be considered by the Seanad - the upper house of parliament - where it will be passed.

After
 that, provided there are no demands for further amendments, the 
legislation will be brought to President Michael D Higgins who will sign
 off on it and enshrine it into Irish law.

However,
 he also has the option of referring it to the Supreme Court to test its
 constitutionality or he can convene a meeting of the Council of State, 
which also advises the president on whether a law is constitutional.

The Government expects the law to be enacted before the Dail breaks for summer on Thursday.
