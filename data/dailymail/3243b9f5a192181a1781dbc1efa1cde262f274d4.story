A 43-year-old man jumped to his death from the third floor escalator at Debenhams 'after a psychiatric hospital refused to admit him', an inquest heard.

Painter and decorator Percival James, who had battled with schizophrenia for many years, was told he did not 'pass the threshold' for admission, according to his former partner and carer.

Donna Burney told Westminster coroner's court she had repeatedly tried to have him sectioned by Maudsley Hospital as his schizophrenia worsened.

Mr James was admitted to the hospital six times between 2007 and 2010, but had not taken any medication or been treated at the hospital since 2010.

Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: 'I find it very striking that there were six admissions in three years and then no admissions in four years.'

The 43-year-old from Lambeth died at the flagship Debenhams store in central London in front of hundreds of shocked customers and staff in November last year.

Witness Serpil Veira told the court she saw a man run towards her before throwing himself over the escalator barrier, according to the Evening Standard.

A post mortem examination gave the cause of death as multiple trauma and head injury. 

Mr James had been under the care of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust since 2007.

His former partner Ms Burney told the inquest he 'believed he had to fight demons and was often heard crying out in anxiety by his neighbour'. 

Coroner Dr Radcliffe expressed concern at the impact that reorganisations at the Maudsley were having on the quality of patient care.

A report found staff to be 'overwhelmed with clinical duties'.

The coroner adjourned the inquest, saying she wished to hear from the trust's medical staff who had cared for Mr James, as well as from a senior official about the reorganisations.

It is expected to reconvene in the summer.

A spokesman for South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust said it would not provide a comment until the inquest had been completed.
