A Ghanaian witch doctor has claimed he is responsible for the injury which could keep Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo out of the World Cup.

Portugal have been drawn in Group G, the 'Group of Death', where they will face tough tests against Germany, the USA and finally Ghana.

Ronaldo has not played since scoring in Real Madrid's Champions League final win against Atletico Madrid on May 25 and a statement released by the Portugal FA on Wednesday confirmed that he is suffering from tendonitis in his left knee as well as a thigh strain.

Water break: Ronaldo trained separately from the main Portugal squad due to injury

The witch doctor, whose name is Nana 
Kwaku Bonsam which translates as 'Devil of Wednesday', predicted Ronaldo
 would be forced to miss the World Cup through injury in February.

In an 
interview with Kumasi-based radio station Angel FM, he is reported as 
saying: 'I know what Cristiano Ronaldo’s injury is about, I’m working on
 him.

'I
 am very serious about it. Last week, I went around looking for four 
dogs and I got them to be used in manufacturing a special spirit called 
Kahwiri Kapam.

'I
 said it four months ago that I will work on Cristiano Ronaldo seriously
 and rule him out of the World up or at least prevent him from playing 
against Ghana and the best thing I can do is to keep him out though 
injury.

'This
 injury can never be cured by any medic, they can never see what is 
causing the injury because it is spiritual. Today, it is his knee, 
tomorrow it is his thigh, next day it is something else.'
