A toddler born with a rare defect has made a miraculous recovery after surgeons were forced to break open his skull and piece it back together like a jigsaw.

At eight-months-old, Harry Phipps was diagnosed with saggital craniosynostosis (SC), a condition causing the skull plates fuse together before birth.

He endured a seven-and-a-half-hour operation to correct the problem and reshape his skull, spending days recovering in Intensive Care.

But now parents Amy Wilson, 26, and Charlie Phipps, 26, from Shefford, Bedfordshire, said they are 'thrilled' their son, now one, is on the road to recovery. 

Harry Phipps underwent a 'miraculous' operation to correct a rare skull condition, which resulted in his head growing in an unusual shape

At eight-months-old Harry was diagnosed with saggital craniosynostosis, a condition causing the skull plates fuse together before birth. The condition causes intracranial pressure, which can lead to persistent headaches, blurred vision and other symptoms

‘When Harry was born in January 2013, his head circumference was larger than normal,’ said Miss Wilson.

‘His head was long and narrow but he had a ridge at the top, which meant that newborn hats were much too small.’

However, Harry passed all his developmental checks and as far as the doctors and his parents were concerned, he was a happy, healthy baby.

But, in August 2013, when he was eight-months-old, he developed gastroenteritis and required treatment at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. 

By chance, a paediatric nurse noticed the unusual shape and size of his head.

‘She advised us to get it measured,’ Miss Wilson said. ‘At first, I was offended but we were referred to see a specialist.’

Initially, the specialist didn’t have any concerns but then he called the family at home to say he suspected a skull defect.

A scan confirmed that Harry had Saggital Craniosynostis, which affects an estimated one in every 1,800 to 3,000 children. Three out of every four cases affects boys.

It can lead to a build-up in pressure in the brain causing headaches, blurred vision and breathing problems.

‘It was completely out of the blue and, at that point, our world fell apart,’ said Miss Wilson.

Surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital had to cut Harry's scalp from ear to ear before breaking his skull and piecing it back together like a jigsaw puzzle

Craniosynostosis is a rare condition, which causes babies to develeop an irregularly shaped skull.

The abnormal shape of a child's head can cause persistent headaches, learning difficulties, problems with vision.

Symptoms of craniosynostosis result from increased pressure in the skull, called intracranial pressure.

The condition causes a baby's skull to prematurely fuse, leaving it unable to grow in certain areas.

Where one area is fused the skull is prevented from growing.

It causes other parts of the skull to 'overgrow' to compensate and limit the pressure devleoping around the brain.

The lack of growth in some areas, and 'overgrowth' in others causes the irregular head shape.

Saggital synostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis, accounting for around half of all cases.

It occurs when the suture - the elastic tissues connecting the plates of bone in the skull - at the top of the head fuses.

It leads to a lack of growth in width and compensatory growth in length, resulting in a long, narrow skull.

‘The doctor explained that if nothing
 was done now, Harry’s head would look like a rugby ball when he was 
older and he could suffer real problems.

‘The only option was a gruelling operation. I felt sick and angry and kept thinking: ‘Why my child?’

Harry underwent the seven-and-a-half hour operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital, on March 12, when he was 13-months old.

During
 the painstaking procedure, surgeons cut his scalp from ear to ear, 
broke his skull into pieces and, in their words, ‘put it back together 
like a jigsaw puzzle’.

‘We’d been warned that there was a small risk he might not make it through the surgery,’ Miss Wilson said.

‘While
 he was having the operation, Charlie and I walked around the hospital 
in a daze, trying to kill time. We did a lot of crying as we waited for 
news.

‘Thankfully, Harry 
made it through but it was eight hours before we could see him. Nothing 
could have prepared us for the sight of our baby lying in Intensive 
Care, with a drain in his head.

‘The following day, his head swelled so much, he couldn’t open his eyes. He didn’t look like our little boy anymore.

'But, by day three, he was able to sit up and was in good spirits. He even unravelled the bandage from around his head.

‘We were devastated by the extent of the scarring on his scalp. The cut ran like an Alice band from ear to ear.

Harry's father, Charlie Phipps (right) and his mother Amy Wilson (left) are raising money for the hospital. Miss Wilson said they are delighted at the results. 'He's bounced back amazingly from his ordeal. We're so proud of our brave boy,' she told MailOnline.

‘But the operation was a success and we were thrilled by the new shape of Harry’s head. Rather than being long and narrow, it was lovely and round.

'After five days in hospital, we were able to take our baby home.’

Ten weeks after his operation, Harry is back to his cheerful self, the swelling has gone down and his blond hair has grown over the scar, which has already started to fade.

'He's bounced back amazingly from his ordeal. We're so proud of our brave boy'

Craniosynostosis can cause developmental problems, but Harry seems to be developing normally.

Although there is a chance that he may develop more problems in future, regular check-ups will monitor his progress – and the family are hopeful that his health problems are in the past.

‘Although Harry’s skull feels bumpy under his scalp, where it’s still knitting back together, his head is now the perfect shape,’ Miss Wilson added.

‘He’s bounced back amazingly from his ordeal. We’re so proud of our brave boy.’

Harry’s father Charlie has just completed 20-mile sponsored assault course, the Rat Race, to raise money for Great Ormond Street hospital.
