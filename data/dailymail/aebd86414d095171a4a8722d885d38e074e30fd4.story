France's most famous lawyer, whose powerful adversaries included former president Nicolas Sarkozy, was found dead yesterday.

The body of Olivier Metzner, 63, was discovered floating off his private island in the Gulf of Morbihan, a natural harbour on the Brittany coast.

Local gendarmes indicated that a suicide note had been found with the distinguished barrister, who represented the likes of rogue trader Jerome Kerviel and Continental Airlines as they defended claims that they were responsible for the Concorde crash which killed 113 people in 2000.

Today, previous client former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega cast doubt on the alleged suicide.

The 79-year-old, who is currently in prison, said he was astounded by the sudden death and that it was ‘incompatible with (Metzner's) personality’.

Mr Metzner defended Noriega in 2010, during a trial which saw him sentenced to seven years in prison.

Today Noriega said he was ‘surprised’ 
and ‘deeply hurt’ to learn of the lawyer’ s death.

Many others have also cast doubt on the idea that Mr Metzner had 
taken his own life.

Mr Metzner’s was particularly well-known for his constant 
clashes with the conservative politician Mr Sarkozy.

Two years ago Mr Metzner insisted ‘I’m not an 
anti-Sarkozy lawyer' as he pointed to alleged irregularities in the 
so-called Bettencourt Affair.

Metzner was France's leading lawyer and was involved in some of country's most high profile cases

It
has seen Mr Sarkozy and his lieutenants accused of receiving millions 
of pounds worth of illegal cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the I’Oreal 
heiress and richest woman in the world, in return for future tax breaks.

Mr
Sarkozy has been made an assisted witness in the on-going case, and Mr 
Metzner was representing Mrs Bettencourt’s daughter, Francoise 
Bettencourt-Meyers.

Mr 
Metzner had suggested that Mr Sarkozy had used his powerful contacts in 
the criminal justice system to intervene in proceedings, so helping the 
former president to avoid proper scrutiny.

Mr
Sarkozy, a former Interior Minister with allies in the French police 
service, is facing a number of serious corruption enquiries, but has 
insisted he is entirely innocent.

Mr Metzner also represented Dominique 
de Villepin, the former Prime Minister and Mr Sarkozy’s hated enemy, in 
the so-called Clearstream Affair, which involved alleged tax scams among
senior French politicians.

Mr Metzner was known for his clashes with former president Nicolas Sarkozy, who is facing a number of corruption inquiries

Mr
Sarkozy was known to be furious when Mr Metzner helped clear Mr 
Villepin of any wrong-doing in 2010.

Mr Metzner, who was born in 
Normandy and was called to the Paris Bar in 1975, also made powerful 
enemies by representing Equatorial Guinea who asked the International 
Court of Justice to order France to end a corruption inquiry into its 
oil-rich rulers.

He bought 
Boedic Island in the Gulf of Morbihan last year, and frequently visited 
it at weekends and during holidays from his work in Paris.

Colleagues of
Mr Metzner at his chambers in the French capital confirmed his death, 
but would not speculate on the causes.

He was working in Paris until a 
few days ago, and had shown no signs of ill-health or particular 
personal worries, according to his colleagues.
