A widow with Alzheimer's was found bound and murdered in her bed with her credit cards strewn across the floor, shocked neighbours said.

Scotland Yard detectives have begun a murder inquiry after the body of 76-year-old Pam Wheeler was discovered at her home in Thamesmead, south-east London.

They were investigating the theory that Mrs Wheeler, described by neighbours as a 'lovely lady', was killed during a 'burglary gone wrong'.

Investigation: Police search for clues in the street in Thamesmead, south-east London, where Pam Wheeler was found dead in her bungalow

Residents said she had not been seen for up to a week and they had been concerned about her health.

They said her body was discovered shortly after 6pm on Sunday by a concerned next-door neighbour who had gone to her bungalow and found the back door open.

Mrs Wheeler, who had recently recovered from breast cancer, lived alone after husband Dennis died a few years ago.

Police yesterday dredged the drains in the quiet street as they searched for clues.

Neighbour Toby McClay, 20, said: 'The neighbour found her. She went into the house and she had her arms and legs tied up, like someone had gone in there to do a burglary that had gone wrong.

'We used to see her all the time walking her three dogs, I think they were Jack Russells, but they were taken away from her because she couldn’t look after them.

'They used to bark all the time and if they had been there someone would have heard them.

'It’s out of order, someone targeting a women like that because she’s old.

'It’s a bungalow and they could have jumped over the back wall.'

Another neighbour, Tracey Smith, 39, said: 'I think she had Alzheimer’s. She never had anyone come over to see her.

'Her husband died a few years ago and that’s when she changed a bit. It’s really, really sad.

'Something should have been done and somebody should have looked after her and then this wouldn’t have happened.

'Pam was really friendly with the children and you would always see her taking her dogs for a walk and she was happy but after her husband passed away she would stand outside at night in her dressing gown on her own and the girl next door phoned the council and said I think she needs help.

'She did have a carer who came round occasionally and she was mobile but she obviously had a few problems.

'My friend is next door. She went in and found her on the bed but I think she had at least her hands tied. Her credit cards were out on the floor.

'She said she was lying in a state and I don’t know if she had been there for a few days.

'My friend was in such a state yesterday that she didn’t manage to tell me if it looked like she had been beaten up.'

A woman neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'Pam was a lovely lady. She didn’t bother anybody, she was very quiet and independent.

'She was always very friendly and polite and would say "hello".

'Her husband (Dennis) died a little while back so she’s been living there alone. I’m not sure if she had any children, although she may have had step-children.

'One of our friends who lives next door to her found her last night. No one had seen her for a little while so we were worried about her.

'The neighbour noticed that Pam’s light wasn’t on at night and that the back door was open.

'When she went inside yesterday she found Pam in the front bedroom. It was a huge shock for her, she’s in an awful state.

'Things like this just don’t happen around here. It’s a quiet road, we never have any problems. Everyone here always looks out for one another and we’re all very friendly.

'For something like this to happen is really scary.

'Everybody is now trying to remember when they last saw Pam. I hadn’t seen her for at least a week, possibly longer than that.'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'We’re keeping an open mind but a "burglary gone wrong" is one line of investigation.

'There were no obvious signs of stab or gunshot wounds.'
