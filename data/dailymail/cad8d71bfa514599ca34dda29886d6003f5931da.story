DJANGO UNCHAINED(18)

Rating:

Quentin Tarantino films and I have never really got on, and it’s partly because the sort of films that inspired him when he was growing up are, by and large, ones I don’t like at all. But then came news that his latest project was a spaghetti Western and it seemed all was perhaps not lost: I rather like spaghetti Westerns.

And, to my astonishment, I loved Django Unchained. Yes, it’s buttock-numbingly long and, yes, it lives up to its 18 certificate for ‘strong, bloody violence’ but it’s still  the best film he’s made for years.

It reunites him with the superlative Christoph Waltz (unforgettable as the charming, psychopathic Nazi in Inglourious Basterds),  benefits from a wonderful supporting  performance from Leonardo DiCaprio and stands real comparison with the films  that made Tarantino deservedly famous: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.

Double act: Django Unchained sees, Christoph Waltz as Dr King Schultz, left, a bounty hunter who asks freed slave Django for help

It takes its title from 1966 spaghetti 
Western Django, directed by Sergio Corbucci and starring the Italian 
actor Franco Nero, now married to Vanessa Redgrave. There’s a lovely 
moment when Nero makes a brief cameo appearance in the new film. ‘The D is silent,’ explains the new Django.

‘I know,’ replies the old one quietly.

When Tarantino, who writes as well as directs, is getting the little details so  wonderfully right, you know he’s on good form.

That sentimental aside apart, however, this is a new story with Jamie Foxx playing Django, a black slave in the Deep South two years before the Civil War,  and Waltz taking on the role of Dr King Schultz, the sharp-shooting ‘dentist’ who so unexpectedly frees him from his chains and offers him a deal.

If Django will help him track down the Brittle brothers, notoriously brutal plantation overseers and now wanted men, he will give him his freedom. As these are the same Brittle brothers who branded and humiliated Django and whipped and then sold his beautiful slave wife, he doesn’t take long to say ‘yes’.

Acting out: Django meets charismatic plantation-owner Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio

In fact, he takes to the bounty-hunting business, as Dr Schultz’s true vocation  is soon revealed to be, with murderous alacrity: ‘Kill white folk and they pay you for it,’ he exclaims, ‘what’s not to like?’

The first hour of Django Unchained is close to perfect, with Waltz, undoubtedly drawing on his Inglourious style, making the linguistically fastidious Schultz  the most interesting and entertaining character Tarantino has written in a long time, while Foxx provides menace, presence and humour as the much-wronged Django.

Captivating: Jamie Foxx in Django Unchained

This is a film about revenge, and when the bad guys get what’s coming,  as they do ever more frequently, they certainly deserve it.

Tarantino’s screenplay, which has already secured him an Oscar nomination and won him a Golden Globe, is spot-on in the first half, delighting in word play and the sort of humour that the Monty Python team or Mel Brooks, in the days of Blazing Saddles, would have loved.

A scene in which a Ku Klux Klan lynch-mob have to rethink their murderous plans because they can’t see out of the eye-holes cut in their hoods is surely  destined to become as famous as Samuel L. Jackson’s and John Travolta’s Big Mac routine in Pulp Fiction.

Watch out for Jonah Hill’s brief cameo as the splendidly sulky clan man whose wife sewed the hoods and, indeed, for Jackson, a Tarantino regular, as a voluble house slave.

Tarantino is a great one for dividing
his film into acts and there’s no doubt the pace slows considerably as 
Act Two begins with Schultz and Django setting off to find Django’s 
wife, the gloriously named Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington).

This change of gear proved close to 
disastrous in Inglourious Basterds but works a lot better here, thanks 
to  DiCaprio’s captivating turn as the charismatic plantation-owner 
Calvin Candie, who likes to be called Big Daddy by his slaves but 
Monsieur Candie by his white peers.

A lot of speechifying by fine southern
gentlemen and the growing suspicion that the actors might be having 
more fun than we are will be a test for some, but the verbal 
pyrotechnics are a Tarantino trademark, DiCaprio has never been better 
and, best of all, there is, of course, some serious shooting to come.

There
is no point being po-faced about the violence; this is a Western, for 
goodness sake. What’s more disconcerting is hearing the now taboo 
‘n-word’ being used over and over again. But this is that rare thing, a 
Tarantino film where the maverick director gets just about all of the 
big  judgment calls right.
