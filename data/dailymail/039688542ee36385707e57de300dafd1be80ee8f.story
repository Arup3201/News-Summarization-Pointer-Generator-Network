Airbus may stop making its super-jumbo, the A380, because sales figures have been so poor, the company's finance director revealed.

Making its first commercial flight in 2007 to great fanfare, the A380 is the world's largest and most glamorous passenger airliner, with two decks that run the entire length of the fuselage.

The A380 has entered service in the fleets of several major airlines, including Emirates, Singapore Airlines, British Airways and Qantas, but the future of the plane was thrown into doubt amid a slump in orders.

Airbus may stop making its super-jumbo, the A380, because sales figures have been so poor

In an unusually frank remark, Airbus finance director Harald Wilhelm told analysts on Wednesday that Airbus would break even on the A380 through 2018, 'if we would do something on the product, or even if we would discontinue the product'.

The unusually frank remark reflected an internal debate over the future of the world's largest airliner but is the first time Airbus has publicly contemplated winding down the project, according to Reuters.

It's one of several scenarios that it's contemplating, the agency said.

Others include slowing production or investing together with Rolls-Royce in an improved engine.

The only new A380 customer Airbus has managed to win this year is lease firm Amadeo shares in Airbus suffered their worst drubbing in more than six years on Wednesday after the planemaker predicted flat profits in 2016.

Industry sources said it is in talks to try to shift a handful of planes no longer destined for Japan's troubled Skymark Airlines to larger Japanese carrier ANA.

Airbus said it would not comment on specific discussions. 

At the moment Airbus has 318 firm orders for the aircraft lined up, with 147 having been delivered. 

The biggest customer is Emirates, which is flying 55 A380s, with another 85 additions to the fleet planned, according to Aviation Week. 

The site's Managing Editor, Jens Flottau, told MailOnline that  Airbus is facing several issues, including the limit to how many carriers can afford them.

He said: 'The A350 and 787 Dreamliner are coming close to the A380 in unit costs so there is little incentive to buy a larger aircraft from the cost perspective. Airlines also shy away from the risk of having to fill another 150 seats per flight. Excess capacity by definition leads to lower fares and often to below-cost fares which airlines obviously seek to avoid.

'The A380 was launched in 2000 and planned in the late 1990s so it is one generation older than the new aircraft. It has four engines, which makes it more expensive to operate and maintain.

'Emirates has become so dominant that a good part of the Europe-Asia market is shifting via Dubai so there is less left for the rest - smaller aircraft are sufficient.

'Finally, it's a huge investment that not many can afford and there's only a limited number of routes that are big enough to justify the aircraft - unless you happen to be Emirates with a huge number of connecting passengers.' 

The head of Dubai-based Emirates reacted angrily to the suggestion that Airbus might stop making the A380, which took 15 years to develop at a cost of $25billion.

Tim Clark told Reuters it could double its investment if the planemaker agreed to upgrade the A380 instead.

'I am not particularly happy as you can imagine,' Clark said.

'We are on the hook for this plane. I get pretty miffed when we have put so much at stake.'

Clark said that if Rolls-Royce and Airbus went ahead with upgrading the engines on the A380 Emirates would eventually replace all the 140 superjumbos it has ordered with the newly upgraded version, as fuel consumption would be lowered by 12 to 15 per cent from 2020.

But he suggested Emirates would hold Airbus to delivering the A380s it has sold if it decides to halt the programme.

Airbus would in that case probably ask Emirates to forego some of its future deliveries, he said, adding, 'That is not a conversation I would like to have'.

Clark said he was worried about the effect Airbus's sombre message would have on future A380 purchases by other airlines, as well as the supply chain and the European aerospace industry which has been a darling of politicians by creating jobs.

He also said the stance would not help the future second-hand value of A380 aircraft.

Clark called on Airbus to step up its A380 marketing efforts, saying it was flying 'full to the gunwales' and making good profits if configured correctly.

The aircraft was designed to help airlines cope with airport congestion.

'This is where Airbus needs to be going, to persuade airlines in the long haul business that this definitely has a place,' he said.

Airbus immediately sought to defuse the row.

'The entire Airbus top management continues to believe strongly in the market prospects of the A380, but any investment by Airbus requires a sound business case, which we will continue to study,' head of corporate communications Rainer Ohler said.

However, Clark raised broader questions about Airbus's strategy for wide-body jets, citing poor sales of the smallest type of A350 and its replacement by an upgraded version of the older A330. Airbus says this has extended a successful product.

'What is happening over there? I would like a first-hand understanding on where they are going,' Clark said, suggesting that Airbus risked being over-dependent on its smaller A320.

The sweeping criticism from one of the airline industry's most influential figures will ring further alarm bells in Toulouse, after Emirates recently cancelled an order for A350s.

However Clark ruled out a broader decline in the relationship and said Emirates would soon consider making an order for 50-70 mid-sized Airbus or Boeing wide-body jets.

He said Emirates wanted to look at in-service performance data on the A350 before deciding whether to place a new order. 

In January 2012 Australian aircraft engineers called for  A380s to be grounded, after Singapore Airlines and Qantas found cracks in the wings of their super-jumbos.

Both airlines, and Airbus, admitted that they had discovered cracks, but maintained that the aircraft were safe.
