Isabella Blow and Alexander McQueen were two of the most influential fashion figures of the 20th century.

Stylist and magazine editor Blow was the embodiment of the English eccentric who discovered the breathtakingly talented Alexander McQueen at his Central Saint Martins graduate fashion show.

He was the enfant terrible of the fashion world whose talent for design has been lauded across the globe.

However, both of their lives were marred by tragedy, depression and unhappiness, leading to their untimely suicides.

The fashion world mourned the loss of Blow after she took her own life in 2007.

Then in February 2010 we lost a true icon in the form of avant-garde and quintessentially quirky British designer Alexander McQueen.

Years before, in 1992, Blow famously bought McQueen's entire graduate collection for £5,000, and went on to become a close friend and ardent supporter of his work and career.

And now, one of the most historically important dresses that Alexander McQueen made for his close friend and collaborator in 2000 is set to go up for auction.

The design is a variation taken from his Eshu collection of Autumn/Winter 2000-2001, which was inspired by the ancient Yoruba people of Benin and Nigeria; Eshu being both a goddess and messenger of death.

The gown combines tribal elements of beadwork and animal hair with a high fashion twist.

The gown, which is expected to fetch between £25,000-35,000, features acid green beads and a broad dark brown horse hair fringe at the hem.

Blow insisted that the dress be made strapless for her, which albeit flattering, made it rather impractical to wear as the weight of the beads produces a strong gravitational pull and she later gave the dress to her assistant.

This exquisite and important McQueen gown is a rarity (the bulk of her wardrobe having been acquired after her death by her close friend Daphne Guinness).

Estimates in the auction start at a few hundred pounds up to tens of thousands and also includes a plethora of Hermès Birkin and Kelly bags in different colours and skins.

Blow started her 30 year career 
auspiciously as an assistant to Anna Wintour at US Vogue. Even then, she
steered clear of the conventional.

At
Blow's memorial service, Wintour said that when Blow worked for Vogue 
she did everything fabulously, even cleaning Wintour's desk with Perrier
water and Chanel perfume.

In the Nineties, Blow was Fashion Director of The Sunday Times, after which she moved to Tatler, again as Fashion Director.

She discovered models Sophie Dahl and Stella Tenant, and worked with major photographers like Steven Meisel and David LaChapelle.

She revelled in shocking people with daring outfits: she once wore a fish-smelling, crystal-encrusted lobster on her head to a fashion show, and Lady Gaga has been cited as a modern-day Blow.

But she began to suffer from depression, and in 2007, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ovarian cancer, Blow committed suicide aged 48.

McQueen received press attention after her suicide with rumours 
circulating that there was a rift between the pair at the 
time of her death, focusing on McQueen's under-appreciation of Blow.

In response to these rumours, McQueen told W magazine: 'It's so much b******. These people just don't know what they're 
talking about.

'They don't know me. They don't know my relationship with 
Isabella. It's complete b*******. People can talk; you can ask her 
sisters ... That part of the industry, they should stay away from my 
life, or mine and Isabella's life.

'What I had with Isabella was 
completely dissociated from fashion, beyond fashion.'

From humble East-end beginnings, McQueen catapulted through life from the 21st floor of a council flat as an obstinate 16-year old embroider (one who stitched the phrase ‘I am a c***’ on a jacket designed for Prince Charles) to an inexorable household name.

Describing his childhood as ‘troubled’, McQueen came out as gay at the age of 18 armed with a reputable foul mouth and offensive humor, often incorporating themes such as death, masochism and violence into his fantastically original collections.

He is also known for having worked as chief designer at Givenchy from 1996 to 2001 and for founding his own Alexander McQueen label. He hanged himself in February 2010.
