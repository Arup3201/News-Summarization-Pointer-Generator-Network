Scientists have shown for the first time that the parents of children with autism (pictured) are more likely to have autistic traits too

Scientists have shown for the first time that the parents of children with autism are more likely to have autistic traits.

Such traits could be an adult just being a little bit too repetitive or more focused on details than usual.

Previous studies have shown the siblings of 
children with autism tend to have more autistic traits than those 
related to children who are not autistic.

‘When there was a child with autism in the family, both parents more often scored in the top 20 per cent of the adult population on a survey we use to measure the presence of autistic traits,’ said John Constantino, professor of psychiatry and paediatrics at Washington University in St. Louis.

‘It could be that a mother or a father is just a little bit repetitive or slightly over focused on details.

‘We can measure the presence of those traits with our questionnaire, but higher scores don’t mean a parent has problems.

'In fact, there may be advantages to having some of those traits.

‘The problem comes when those traits are so intense that they begin to impair a person’s ability to function.’

He explained that too large a ‘helping’ of particular traits can have a negative influence on a child’s behaviour and social skill and that traits related to autism tend to be natural variations in social skills.

For the study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, researchers analysed data from 256 children with diagnoses of autism and almost 1,400 children who did not have the disorder.

Data from more than 1,200 mothers and 1,600 fathers of the children was also examined.

All of the subjects were part of the Nurses’ Health Study II, which has been gathering health information from more than 116,000 nurses since 1989.

Scientists have shown that the parents of children with autism are more likely to have autistic traits too- and these could simply be a very high attention to details (illustrated) for example. When there was a child with autism in the family, both parents more often scored in the top 20 per cent of the adult population on used to measure the presence of autistic traits

Nearly half of the siblings of autistic children develop abnormally, according to a study published last month.

Scientists discovered 17 per cent go on to develop autism themselves and a further 28 per cent show delays in their development or behaviour.

But these signs can be detected at a year old, meaning the children can get help as early as possible.

Among the 28 per cent of children who showed developmental delays, differences were identified in their social, communication, cognitive or motor development by 12 months.

The most common deficits were in social communication and caused problems such as extreme shyness with unfamiliar people, lower levels of eye contact and delayed pointing.

Sally Ozonoff, lead author and professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the UC Davis MIND Institute in California, said: ‘Having a child in the family with autism spectrum disorder means that subsequent infants born into that family should be regularly screened for developmental and behavioural problems by their paediatricians.

Together with colleagues at the Harvard School of Public Health, the scientists used the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) to measure the presence of autistic traits.

People who score less than 59 on the SRS are considered normal.

When both parents had mild elevations in SRS scores, the study indicated that they were 85 per cent more likely than parents without elevated scores to have a child with a form of autism.

If only one parent’s SRS score was high, the likelihood of having a child on the autistic spectrum increased by 53 per cent.

Even among non-autistic children, elevated parent scores correlated with higher SRS scores in their children.

Professor Constantino said: ‘It turns out that people tend to select one another on the basis of many of the same traits that the SRS measures.

'Likes attract. If one person has a high score, he or she is more likely to partner with another person who also scores high.’

Such a partnership is likely to raise the chances that their offspring will have elevated SRS scores.

‘When both parents have scores at or above the top 20 per cent, the child’s score is 20 to 30 points higher than when neither parent has an elevated SRS score,’ he said.
