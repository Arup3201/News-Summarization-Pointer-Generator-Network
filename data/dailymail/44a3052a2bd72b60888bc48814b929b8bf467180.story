Nasa has revealed a huge new gully on the Martian surface - and says it formed in just three years.

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter snapped the area in 2010 and 2013 - and today revealed the before and after images that show the gully appearing.

They say it was probably formed by carbon-dioxide frost.

Since its arrival in orbit in 2006, MRO 
and its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) telescope 
have been mapping the martian surface.

It completed its primary science phase in 2008 and continues investigations of Mars' surface, subsurface and atmosphere.

The orbiter sports a dish antenna 10 feet in diameter and uses it to pour data Earthward at up to 6 megabits per second. It has a number of instruments including three cameras - one of which is HiRise, a spectrometer for identifying minerals, a ground-penetrating radar and an atmosphere sounder.

Gully or ravine landforms are common on Mars, particularly in the southern highlands,' Nasa said.

'This pair of images shows that material flowing down from an alcove at the head of a gully broke out of an older route and eroded a new channel.'

The dates of the images are more than a full Martian year apart, so the observations did not pin down the Martian season of the activity at this site.

Before-and-after HiRISE pairs of similar activity at other sites demonstrate that this type of activity generally occurs in winter, at temperatures so cold that carbon dioxide, rather than water, is likely to play the key role, the team believe.

The area is home to several large gullies and channels

MRO has observed other Martian features that do seem associated with liquid water â€” dark streaks known as recurring slope lineae, for instance.

Since its arrival in orbit in 2006, MRO 
and its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) telescope 
have been mapping the martian surface.

The
 HiRISE team released preliminary, black-and-white images in March of 
that year, and have since collected hundreds more.

This pair of before (left) and after (right) images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show the new gully forming on a Martian slope between Nov. 5, 2010, and May 25, 2013.

Since 2006, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been charting the red planet's terrain. This image shows defrosting of the crests of 'Inca City'. This is the informal name given to a set of intersecting ridges that are located among the layered materials of the south polar region of Mars. Their origin has never been understood
