The latest issue of Time magazine features Hillary Clinton on its cover, but there's something different about the former secretary of state and would-be Madam President.

The way the magazine's graphic designers positioned her silhouette under the letter 'M' in its iconic masthead appears to tack a pair of devil horns on her head.

And it's not the first time Time has done this to a world leader.

The March 23, 2015 cover of Time magazine gives Hillary Clinton unintentional devil horns

Vladimir Putin, Barack Obama, Margaret Thatcher and Pope Francis have gotten the photographic Beelzebub treatment.

Even Jesus Christ was once pictured with horns – right above his crown of thorns. 

This week's subtle jab at Clinton, intentional or not, comes as she is under fire for using a secret, private email system during her years as secretary of state.

Democratic insiders are beginning to reconsider her role as the party's 'inevitable' 2016 presidential nominee, and other potential candidates are testing the waters.

Time's White House correspondent shared some insider gossip about reactions to the Hillary cover

The cover story is headlined 'The Clinton Way,' and chronicles Mrs. Clinton's and her husband's long history of bending rules – and, some argue, laws – to conform to their political ambitions.

'They write their own rules. Will it work this time?' Time asks.

'Along with her husband – the 42nd President of the United States – Hillary Clinton is the co-creator of a soap-operatic political universe in which documents vanish, words like "is" take on multiple meanings and foes almost always overplay their hand,' author David von Drehle writes.

'Impeachment can be a route to higher approval ratings; the occasional (and rare) defeat merely marks the start of the next campaign. Whatever rules may apply to them, the law of gravity is not one.'

HOLY SMOKES: 'Time' has even put Pope Francis and JESUS underneath its iconic letter 'M'

One Time reporter who covers the White House wrote on Twitter that that his colleagues were trading quips about the Hillary cover.

'Actual discussion in the TIME office: "That’s not the way the horns would be",' he tweeted.

Time's editors responded to the online hubbub with a few paragraphs online and a collection of nearly three dozen instances where the 'M' produced unexpected headgear.

'This has happened before. ... 'Any resemblance to cats, bats or devil horns is entirely coincidental,' They wrote.
