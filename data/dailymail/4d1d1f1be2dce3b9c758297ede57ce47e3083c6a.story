Former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler has applied to become the next Leeds manager.

The Championship side are seeking a new boss after sacking Dave Hockaday after just six games.

The 39-year-old has been pushed forward for the vacant post at Elland Road by intermediaries and owner Massimo Cellino is due back from a break in USA on Wednesday to consider all applicants.

Heading back to Leeds? Robbie Fowler has put forward his application for the Leeds United job

Cellino sacked Dave Hockaday after just six games but Fowler, who had a spell playing for Leeds between 2001 and 2003, is undeterred.

The former Liverpool striker had a spell as player-coach with Muangthong United in Thailand and has been coaching at Liverpool alongside Steve McManaman and Rob Jones but is ready to take on a number one management role.

Academy manager Neil Redfearn has been placed in temporary charge of Leeds' first team ahead of Saturday's game with Birmingham City and Cellino said he has 'not heard of anyone better to look after the team', however, Redfearn is understood to have reservations about taking the role full-time.

Short spell: Fowler spent two years at Elland Road in the Premier League, scoring 14 goals in 30 league games

Steve Clarke, Tony Mowbray and Chris Hughton have also expressed an interest with Cellino keen to appoint a British coach.

Hughton, who was sacked as Norwich City manager last season, said: 'There are lots of challenges out there and Leeds United is very much a challenge. I’m very keen to get back in at the right club.'
