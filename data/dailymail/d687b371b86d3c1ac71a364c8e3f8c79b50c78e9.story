The shameful tactics used by one of Britain’s biggest payday loan companies can be exposed by The Mail on Sunday today.

An undercover investigation into high street chain The Cheque Centre – which claims to be ‘a responsible lender’ – reveals how it preys on vulnerable customers and cash-strapped families, locking them into spiralling debt. Our shocking investigation reveals how:

Easy money: Manager Stephen Hunt holds cash in a separate branch of the loan shop which featured last week

An employee tells the reporter about the ruthless conversations some have with clients

The revelations came as the Financial Conduct Authority announced new rules clamping down on the industry.

A
 Mail on Sunday reporter, posing as a trainee manager, worked in one of 
the company’s 496 branches where he secretly filmed staff describing the
 firm’s heartless tactics.

The
 Cheque Centre, which turned over £374 million last year and whose 
adverts are fronted by celebrities such as Scottish football manager 
Ally McCoist, claims it offers loans for everyday emergencies,.

But our investigator watched as a stream of customers, often on benefits, asked to borrow as much money as possible. 

Demanding: Sophie Grafton, 22, is the company¿s area manager for the South-East of England. She sent out emails last week to Cheque Centre staff at the Hounslow store ordering them to sign up more customers for payday loans

Staff admitted that they knew many of the people would use the cash for drink or gambling.

Concerned
 about the number of people visiting the branch who smelt of alcohol, 
our reporter asked his boss, manager Stephen Hunt, what the company’s 
policy was on handing them loans.

Hunt replied: ‘That is OK in this 
place or we wouldn’t serve half our customers otherwise. Use your 
judgment. I’ve never not served anyone.’

Last year the firm promised to clean up its act after staff were seen leafletting benefits claimants, even stopping mums with prams in the street.

But our reporter, based at the Hounslow branch in West London, observed staff canvassing the high street. One worker admitted during a previous sales drives they had been ordered to target council estates.

He said: ‘When I was training we had a map. So you get a particular area where we would give leaflets to – blocks of flats.’

The controversial company also came under fire last year after it chased a desperate father-of-two for repayments and even took money from his bank account as he lay in hospital after a failed suicide attempt prompted by his mounting debts.

Our investigator filmed as one member of staff explained how this ruthless practice, known as ‘swiping’, works. The technique is allowed as long as the salesman has got the customer to sign a continuous payment authority, giving the company power over their bank account.

The salesman boasted: ‘Say the loan is £220 and they’ve only got £50 in their account. We’ll take that. Consequently you’ll get customers coming in and saying, “You’ve taken this much out of my account and I’ve got to feed my kids.” ’ His reply? ‘Sorry madam, this is our right. You shouldn’t have taken a loan, should you?’

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby weighed into the paydoay loans controversy last year, promising the Church of England would try to help borrowers itself.

Politicians and regulators have sworn to clamp down on the sector and on Friday the Financial Conduct Authority published ‘get tough’ rules.

CHAIN: The company turned over £374million last year and claims to be a responsible lender that is dedicated to helping people in financial difficulties

Customers can borrow a maximum of £1,000 for 30 days at a rate of £29.99 for every £100 borrowed.

If they borrow £1,000, they will owe £299.90 at the end of the month. If the customer cannot repay in full they are encouraged to pay the interest and roll the loan over.

The following month they do the same, so each month they pay almost £300 in additional fees. The annual percentage rate (APR) is 3,873 per cent.

The regulations, which come into 
effect on April 1, will require lenders to make proper checks that 
borrowers can afford the loans; limit how often loans can be ‘rolled 
over’ to just two; limit the use of the continuous payment authorities 
and require lenders to help customers who can’t repay to find free 
advice services.

Our 
investigator found rolling over debts was rife at The Cheque Centre. On 
Thursday, the day before dozens of loans were due to be repaid, the 
store received £23,000 for customers it expected to roll over their 
debt.

Hunt said: ‘We’ve just had £23,000 delivered today. The way they (the company) look at it is we’ve got 48 people who are going to pay all their loans off then they’ll all be back again to reloan.’

On several occasions our reporter observed customers being offered rollover loans, even if they had defaulted.

Some had been borrowing for as long as 18 months and had received more than a dozen consecutive loans.

The reporter watched people on benefits being given approvals in minutes. Even if they failed the credit check they were encouraged to sell or pawn gold and mobile phones for cash instead.

Hunt told our reporter: ‘If a customer comes in and the loan declines, you say, “Well do you have any unwanted gold or phones? You don’t need no credit rating for  that.” ’ The company then offers paltry prices for valuable goods

Worker Kyle Alawooja said: ‘For an iPhone 4s they (the company) will take £20. You’ll find customers are so desperate they’ll take it. You would be surprised.

‘The question is how did they get it? Is it really theirs or have they stolen it? A lot of the customers, I’ve thought, “That’s not their phone they’ve stolen it.” But you’ve got no way of proving it.’

Staff are under huge pressure to sell loans. Sophie Grafton is area manager for south-east England.

The 22-year-old pressured staff to drum up business last week, demanding they improve the amount of loans they were issuing. One email to the Hounslow store said: ‘Still on zero?! Change this now please!’

Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has led the campaign for payday loan companies to have tough restrictions, said: ‘What The Mail on Sunday’s investigation has found doesn’t surprise me because I’ve been warning about the techniques of these companies for years.

‘Once you are on their list you are absolutely hunted down and squeezed dry. These practices are completely unacceptable. This is an industry which is full of bad practise. The conduct of these companies is beyond the pale.’

Last night a spokesman for The Cheque Centre said it was investigating The Mail on Sunday’s findings.

They added: ‘Our focus has to be on treating our customers fairly and lending responsibly. If it were found that a small number of individuals are not following the strict policies and processes in place to protect our customers, then that is something we would immediately address.’
