Luis Suarez has revealed the full extent of the injustice felt by the severity of his ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini, insisting Barcelona boss Luis Enrique referred to his return to training as 'like releasing a prisoner from Guantanamo'.

The Uruguayan was banned from all of football activity for four months, which originally meant he was unable even to train with his new employers until the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled in August that he could resume non-competitive sessions.

In his new autobiography, Luis Suarez: Crossing the Line - My Story, the forward reveals how Barca coach Enrique was incensed with the treatment he had received from FIFA.

According to Suarez, Enrique compared his situation with that of a convict having been released from the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay.

Suarez writes: 'It wasn't the most orthodox of presentations to the rest of the squad either, the day I was finally allowed to train with the team.

'Barcelona's manager Luis Enrique gathered in the players and told them: "Well, they have finally got him out of Guantanamo to be here with us today for training..."

'Everyone applauded the released prisoner and I did my best not to look too embarrassed about being the centre of attention.'

The severity of Suarez's ban led to a media frenzy which the striker believes almost derailed his £75million move from Liverpool to the Nou Camp in the summer.

With the paparazzi following him everywhere, Suarez describes his transfer as a 'covert operation'.

Three cars were utlilised in a slick, undercover plan to ensure Suarez was not spotted as he headed to Barcelona to sign his contract.

'Signing my new contract at Barcelona without it becoming public was a difficult operation too,' Suarez continues. 'The club had permission to sign me but it had to stay a private matter.

'There was a three-car plan in place with three different vehicles leaving the Nou Camp from three different exits in the event of us realising the press has been alerted. I had already got used to everything being a covert operation.

'Apart from all the things I couldn't be because of the FIFA ban, there was also a lot I couldn't do because of the attention that now followed my every move.'
