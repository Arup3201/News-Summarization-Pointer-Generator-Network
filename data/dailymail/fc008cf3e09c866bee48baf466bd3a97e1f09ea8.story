A 21-year-old drunk woman who allegedly asked her also-drunk boyfriend to drive her home in her car could be facing up to 30 years in jail.

Erin Brown allegedly wanted Trevor Bradshaw, 23, to drive her Toyota Scion in Nashville, Tennessee, but he fatally hit two young men and a taxi.

She was a passenger on the night last December but, in a city first, has been charged along with Bradshaw with vehicular homicide and assault.

Wreckage: Trevor Bradshaw allegedly hit two people then drove the car across a central reservation in Nashville's Music Row area and hit a taxi

This is the first case of its kind in Nashville, but driving under the influence charges are often seen when people hand their keys to a drunk-driver.

Tennessee Titans quarterback Steve McNair was arrested in 2007 for letting his drunk friend drive his pickup, but all charges were dismissed.

Brown told police Bradshaw ‘was drunker than she thought he was’ when he hit Michael Brooksher, 22, and Tommy Allen, 23, on December 10.

Bradshaw allegedly then drove the car across a central reservation in the city’s Music Row area and hit a taxi head-on, reported The Tennessean.

Bradshaw fled the scene until he was brought back by two witnesses, before he fled again ahead of the arrival of police, an arrest warrant said.

'It seems common sense to me. If you let a drunk or impaired person drive a car, you’re responsible'

District attorney spokesman

Brown had minor injuries and stayed there. Mr Brooksher died on December 12 and Mr Allen on February 7. Bradshaw allegedly later turned himself in.

A police spokesman who has been with the force for 20 years said he has never heard of a vehicular manslaughter charge against a non-driver.

‘It seems common sense to me,’ a district attorney spokesman said. ‘If you let a drunk or impaired person drive a car, you’re responsible.’

Meanwhile Mr Brooksher’s father Jeffrey is suing Brown and Bradshaw for $10million following the loss of his son, reported The Tennessean.
