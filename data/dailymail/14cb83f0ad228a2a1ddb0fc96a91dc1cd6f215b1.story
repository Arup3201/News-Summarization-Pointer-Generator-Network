Concerns: Antonia Attuh, is believed to have been among the 153 people killed on board a plane that crashed in Nigeria last Sunday

One of the victims of the Nigerian plane disaster had fled the country and settled in Britain as a refugee after the 1972 war in Biafra, it has emerged.

Computer expert Antonia Attuh, 46, died when a Dana Air Flight 9J-992 crashed on Sunday night on its approach to Lagos airport after a flight from the capital Abuja.

Her devastated sister Jill, has called for an international inquiry into what caused both engines to fail on the 22 year-old Macdonald Douglas MD-83 aircraft.

Her sister Jill told yesterday how brilliant mathematician Antonia spoke not a word of English when she arrived in Britain as a four-year-old.

After settling in Liverpool with her parents, from an early age Antonia excelled in her studies and won a scholarship to Notre Dame RC Girls’ Grammar School.

She achieved excellent A-level results and went on to win twin degrees in economics and finance before obtaining a doctorate in computer science.

Antonia then embarked on a career in local government and was the first black woman to become a senior management executive with Westminster City Council.

Two years ago, Antonia took a job with a the Central Bank of Nigerian and decided that her three children should accompany her in order to expose them to her homeland’s life and culture.

Antonia’s husband technology expert Robert Attuh, remained at the family home in Radlett, Hertforshire, while she often travelled back and forth to the UK with Chamaka, 12, Chikes, eight, Amarachi, aged six.

Speaking on Radio 5 Live's Up All Night programme yesterday, Ms Chime said another sister had flown to Nigeria to help other family members find Antonia's body, which they believe is in a hospital mortuary.

All 153 passengers died when the Dana 
Air flight crashed in a neighbourhood about five miles north of Murtala 
Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, south-west Nigeria, on Sunday.

The
 plane was coming from the Nigerian capital Abuja when it crashed into a
 printing works and residential buildings in the busy Iju-Ishaga suburb.

An unknown number of people on the ground were also killed.

The
 Foreign Office was unable to confirm whether Ms Attuh was aboard, but a 
spokeswoman said: 'It is believed that there was a dual British-Nigerian
 national on board the flight.

'The Foreign Office has been in contact with a member of her family and offered consular assistance.'

Ms Chime said her sister had travelled to Nigeria frequently in recent years, and was going to Lagos to attend a course.

She
 said: 'My sister was a wonderful person, quite an exceptional person. 
She was a statistician - maths was the thing she loved doing and loved 
most.'

Ms Chime said she was at her parents' house on Sunday when they first heard about the crash.

She said: 'My sister was travelling to Lagos and that was as far as I knew. I wasn't certain of what airline she had gone on.

'We were immediately concerned because
 we had spoken to my sister in the morning and she was telling us she 
was going to Lagos that afternoon.

'When I heard about the crash I had to try and find out what airline she had taken.'

A
 cousin who was due to collect Ms Attuh from the airport told Ms Chime 
her sister was aboard the doomed Dana Air flight, which was also 
confirmed by Ms Attuh's husband, who had seen her off.

Ms Chime also said the airline also told her that her sister's name was on the final passenger list.

Her family, including another sister, are now trying to find Ms Attuh's body.

Ms
 Chime said: 'I also have my cousin who yesterday had gone through 
30-odd bodies trying to locate her, and today he has gone through a 
further 40.

'But as of yet, we still have no confirmation of a corpse.It is very difficult and distressing.'

Ms Chime called for an inquiry into the cause of the crash.

She said: 'Only then can the lessons of 
this tragedy be learned. My sister would not have rested until she had 
gotten to the bottom of what happened and why it happened.'

The Nigerian government yesterday suspended the licence of Dana Air airline as a matter of safety and grounded all of its flights while it investigates the accident.

The Dana Air McDonnell Douglas MD-83's crew radioed the tower at the airport in Lagos shortly before the crash to say they had engine trouble, but the exact cause remains unclear.
