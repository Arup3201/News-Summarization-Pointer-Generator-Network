If it had been a Hollywood movie, it would have been slated for its bad acting.

But Mickey Rourke was not in character on Friday night when he stepped into the ring after a 20-year absence.

The 62-year-old took on Elliot Seymour, who is 33 years his junior, in a sanctioned five-round fight in Moscow.

Rourke needed less than two rounds to stop his opponent who collapsed to the canvas after taking what looked a rather tame body shot.

He beat the count but was soon down again and the fight was waved off.

After a 30-fight amateur career in the 1960s and 70s, of which he lost just three, Rourke stopped competing in favour of chasing his dream in Hollywood.

He returned as a professional for eight fights in the 90s, causing damage to his face that necessitated surgery and changed his appearance.

In 2008 he starred in The Wrestler about a washed-up fighter making a comeback, winning a Golden Globe for best actor.

Seymour, meanwhile, had lost all but one of his nine fights since 2009.

After this performance, they’d both be better off hanging up their gloves.

Rourke had a 30-fight amateur boxing career during the 1960s and 70s, and was last in the ring 20 years ago
