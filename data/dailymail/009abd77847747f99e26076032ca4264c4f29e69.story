Lines to get on the new Harry Potter ride at Universal Orlando Resort were more than seven hours long on opening day Tuesday.

Fans began lining up before dawn for the public opening of the The Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Diagon Alley’ attraction, modeled after the London shopping district for wizards that is featured in Rowling's book series.

The area quickly filled to capacity, leading to staggered admissions into the self-contained attraction, employees handing out tickets with return times, and – according to one visitor – the creation of a nap zone in the waiting area for sleepy visitors in line.

Early risers: Fans lined up before the sun was even up over Orlando on Tuesday

Folks on Twitter were tweeting pictures of a sign listing the 450-minute wait time outside the ride, called Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, though Universal spokesman Tom Schroder noted that wait time varied throughout the day.

Universal workers were handing out tickets with return times printed on them to ease congestion. But is the wait worth it?

‘If we could give it a standing ovation, we would,’ Nikida Vaughn of Florida told the Orlando Sentinel after experiencing the interactive roller coaster.

The opening of Diagon Alley is expected to provide a boost to the theme park's revenues and to tourism in central Florida.

The long waits and exuberant fans were 
reminiscent of the 2010 opening of Hogsmeade Village, the theme park's 
original Harry Potter attraction.

This time, however, gridlock did not spill over to the interstate highway and snarl traffic into Orlando as it did in 2010, said a spokeswoman for the Florida Highway Patrol

The Diagon Alley expansion is connected to the Hogsmeade attraction by the new Hogwarts Express, a four-minute train ride based on a magical locomotive in the series.

The Potter-themed areas are in two adjoining Universal parks, each of which requires a separate admission. A ride on the train requires a $136 two-park pass.

Comcast Corp's Universal Studios will bring the world of 'Harry Potter' to its Hollywood theme park in 2016, part of a multi-year revamp of its film-themed attractions.
