An epileptic runner stunned family and friends by completing the London Marathon - despite suffering an astonishing 20 fits on the 26.2-mile route.

Simone Clarke collapsed and fell unconscious for 30 seconds every time a seizure struck.

But the determined 39-year-old managed to get back up each time and went on to reach the finish line in six-and-a-half hours.

Simone, from Southampton, Hampshire, suffers from around four seizures each day but that didn't stop her from entering the race to raise funds for the Epileptic Society.

With friend Tally Hall, 27, by her side, she overcame incredible odds to train for the challenge.

During practice 20-mile runs she suffered one or two seizures but she never expected to suffer so many on the day.

Thankfully, Tally was by her side to catch her every time she fell and bring her around.

Simone said: 'By the time we got to 15 miles I was in tears because I was so annoyed we had lost the pace.

'But by that stage I had already had lots of fits and I was still standing so I thought: "Stuff it, I'm just going to finish it".'

Endurance: Simone had suffered a few fits during her 20-mile practice runs, but she had no idea just how testing the real thing would prove to be

The first fit came at the eight-mile mark when Mrs Clarke began suffering severe pains caused by a stomach problem.

Having left her medication at home, the pains became steadily worse and the stress triggered her first fit.

Tally said: 'I was expecting Simone to have a couple of seizures but I wasn't expecting a constant battle of seizures and running.

'I have never known her to be that bad before.'

Simone raised Â£800 for her charity and says she owes her success to her friend.

She added: 'It's all thanks to Tally. Without her I would never have been able to do it.'

Angie King, from the Epilepsy Society, said the charity had never had any runner suffer a seizure during the marathon before.

She added: 'Simone is unique and, to us, an absolute star.'
