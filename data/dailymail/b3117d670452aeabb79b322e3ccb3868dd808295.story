Many of us use Facebook to plan parties and invite guests these days and most us of click to say we're attending without giving it much thought.

But what if complete strangers, who had also clicked to attend the same event, could then see your profile and personal information without you having a clue?

Winkli is a new app, hoping to launch in July, which essentially allows people to obtain information about someone before meeting them.

The Winkli website allows you to sign up to be notified when the app- which will allow you to check out people attending the same events as you beforehand-launches

Described as ‘your clever 
companion for future plans’ Winkli will allow you to ‘check out girls 
and guys’ who have replied as 'attending' to any event invitation on 
Facebook which you plan to go to as well, Buzzfeed reports.

Essentially a dating app, one of the key pieces of information Winkli sends you about guests at any upcoming events is their relationship status, alongside mutual friends, interests and anything left ‘public’ on that person’s Facebook profile.

Users will be able to filter results to show them, for example, anyone who is also attending Glastonbury who is single, in their 30s and likes the same films and TV programmes.

The idea is that you can scout out potential romantic targets before ever meeting them, and even prepare conversations based on their likes or hobbies.

While this might seem like a clever, time-saving device for the savvy single in the digital age, there are worries about privacy.

Other apps only involve or allow you to view people who have voluntarily signed up to them and created a profile of the information they want you to see.

Controversially Winkli uses Facebook information and does not allow people to opt out of being searchable.

So by merely clicking 'attending' on an event all your public information becomes available to anyone else attending that event that has downloaded Winkli.

The only way to avoid this is to manually remove yourself from every event you are invited too.

Winkli, which already has an active Twitter account, will use public Facebook information without specific consent

However since the app is only taking information left ‘public’ on Facebook it is likely it would not break the websites strict privacy rules.

Speaking to Siraj Datoo at Buzzfeed, Winkli CEO and co-founder Alexis Dupont defended the app, which could allow strangers to view all profile pictures, ‘liked’ groups or pages and even location or workplace information, depending on your individual privacy settings.

Arguing that they only are in fact using data that Facebook has already made public, Alexis said:

‘We just have the first name of the person, the picture, his friends’ connections and the likes that you have in common.

‘One thing that you cannot do is completely hide yourself.’
