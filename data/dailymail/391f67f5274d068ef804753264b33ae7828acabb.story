Are you brave enough?: Patriotic new Englandkini is available from Amazon for £7.99

If the England players stuggle with the scorching heat during the World Cup in Brazil, here’s an interesting piece of kit that will certainly keep them cool.

UK firm ThumbsUp! have designed a skimpy Englandkini, emblazoned with the England flag.

While it's unlikely we'll see Wayne Rooney and co in the Borat-style novelty gear, the creators are hoping to send some over to the England camp.

The company said: ‘It’s the perfect kit to keep cool in Brazil and it’ll definitely keep their Brazil Nuts covered.

‘We hope we can get some to the players as we’re sure they’d see the funny side.’

The
 company claims football fans are going crazy for the mankini as it’s 
quite a lot cheaper than an official England Jersey, which is on sale 
for £90. 

In comparison, the EnglandKini is available from Amazon for just £7.99.

England play their first group match against Italy on Saturday night.

New data from travel search engine Kayak says hoardes of English fans are heading out to Brazil, with UK flight searches up a whopping 697 per cent compared to 2013.

That figure is considerably more than Germans, Spanish, French and Italians researched.

Starting the trend: Sacha Baron Cohen started a mankini frenzy in 2006 when he wore one in his film Borat
