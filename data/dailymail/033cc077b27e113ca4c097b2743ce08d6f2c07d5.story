Whatever the Duchess of Cambridge touches turns to gold.

From the Zara cornflower blue dress to the vibrant pink jeans, her wardrobe choices have sent high-street sales soaring with shoppers desperate to emulate her impeccable style.

But is isn't only clothing stores who are feeling the Kate effect, it's an attempt to recreate her eyebrows that have women reaching for their purses.

Scouse Brow: Kate's thick, dark and well-groomed eyebrows have been grabbing headlines with women rushing to emulate her well-groomed style

Peak: Sales peaked over the Bank Holiday weekend, with each day witnessing record sales as Kate appeared on TV at various Jubilee events

Her so-called 'Scouse brows', which have more recently been dubbed 'the southern brows', have been grabbing the headlines in recent months and now beauty retailers are reaping the rewards.

Leading online beauty retailer Escentual.com who have a turnover of over £10m a year, has seen sales of eyebrow enhancing and defining products up six times compared with last year – and they claim it’s all down to the Kate Middleton effect.

Sell out: Total sales of eyebrow products (including all brands of browkits and tweezers) soared in June

Total sales of eyebrow products (including all brands of browkits and tweezers) soared in June as women nationwide stocked up on the top beauty product to recreate Kate's dark, thick eyebrows.

The biggest sales spike came over the Diamond Jubilee celebration weekend which saw their best-selling kit, the Clarins Pro Palette, selling out nationwide.

Thanks to the Duchess, Escentual Marketing Director Louise Reed believes they could have sold double the number if they had been available.

Sales peaked over the Bank Holiday weekend, with each day witnessing record sales.

During this weekend Kate appeared a lot on TV, firstly in a red outfit on the Thames river boat procession on board The Spirit of Chartwell, then for the Jubilee pop concert and finally at St Pauls Cathedral.

Louise Reed said: 'The Kate effect has been phenomenal to sales in June. Over the Jubilee celebrations we sold nearly five months worth of stock in three days –and it can only be down to Kate Middleton.'

She added: 'Clearly this was a time when a lot of the country were watching Kate on TV and she looked absolutely amazing so many women went online to try and emulate her eyebrow look.'

'From now on, whenever there is a major televised event that Kate is attending we make sure that we stock up on key products to try to keep up with demand.'

More recently there was a smaller peak on 18th June from the Order of the Garter service in Windsor, and also for Kate’s appearances at Wimbledon with Prince William and for the final with her sister Pippa.
