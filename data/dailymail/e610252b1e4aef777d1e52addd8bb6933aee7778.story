She provoked outrage when she had her breasts enlarged on the NHS because her flat chest upset her.

Now aspiring glamour model Josie Cunningham is risking the wrath of taxpayers yet again for taking council-funded taxi trips worth nearly £6,000 a year – because she says she is too scared to take the bus.  

The 24-year-old claims she is so hated following publicity about her breast operation that she cannot use public transport to take her two young children to and from school.

Mother: Josie Cunningham infamously had her 32A breasts enlarged to a 36DD with taxpayers' money

She told her GP that the stress was giving her anxiety attacks and that her children, aged six and three, were missing school and nursery as a result.

Leeds City Council has reportedly now accepted an application for free school taxi trips on health grounds.

It means Miss Cunningham, a single mother who is five months pregnant, is receiving around £150 of free fares a week – the equivalent of £5,700 per school year.

Comparing herself to former glamour model Katie Price, she  said: ‘You wouldn’t see Katie Price get a bus — and I’m much more hated than her.

‘Why should I foot the bill when it’s the public who cause me so much discomfort? They can pay for it. I couldn’t get a bus again. I’m too well recognised and the amount of hate I receive makes it impossible to get public transport.’

Before and after: Her breast enlargement operation came after she was recommended for funding by her GP

And, in a brazen interview with the 
Sun, she added: ‘Taxpayers should be grateful it’s only taxi fares and 
not private hire cars.’ Yesterday she refused to comment further and 
referred all questions to her agent.

Miss
 Cunningham shot to notoriety last year when she had a £4,800 operation 
to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been 
bullied since she was 14 for having a  flat chest. Her operation was 
carried out by the same NHS trust that had refused to fund surgery that 
would have enabled a two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to 
walk.

Miss Cunningham later claimed her breasts were ‘so big’ she found them embarrassing and said the NHS should pay for a reduction.

Then she tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cash.

But
 when she became pregnant after working as a £1,000-a-night escort, she 
admitted she cannot uphold her pledge – and now continues to be a drain 
on public funds.

Indeed two months ago she boasted she would be having £2,500 of free dental work now she is expecting.

Since
 last month, Miss Cunningham and her children have been driven 
two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school, twice a day. The 
journey would cost around £30 a week by bus.

This year Leeds council is having to make savings of £50million from its budget.

A
 spokesman said: ‘We are not able to comment on individual cases. 
However, the council takes matters relating to attendance at school 
extremely seriously.’

Miss Cunningham’s neighbours were not impressed.

A
 father of four, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It seems like 
she’s doing it to annoy people. Thousands of pounds are being wasted and
 there are people out there who need it.

‘She’s
 just money grabbing and gives genuine claimants a bad name. Parents are
 struggling to put food on the table and she gets the school run for 
free in a comfortable taxi.’

A
 young mother said: ‘I see the taxis come and go. They are nice black 
and white taxis as well. It’s ridiculous. No one gets special treatment 
like her and she doesn’t care. She loves the attention.’

Yesterday hundreds of readers posted messages on Mail Online to condemn Miss Cunningham – and Leeds council for funding her.

One
 reader said: ‘Make her walk! It’s just outrageous  that she is still 
fleecing the taxpayers and has no regrets,’ while another wrote: ‘Sack 
the person who okayed paying for this  taxi service.’
