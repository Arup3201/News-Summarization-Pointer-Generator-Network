One in 20 Britons have admitted to cheating on their partner whilst on holiday.

And three per cent of unfaithful people claim that 'it doesn't count as cheating if you're on another continent', according to a new poll.

Ibiza has been named the most top location for infidelity abroad, with 39 per cent of respondents citing it the location they'd be more tempted to cheat on their partner.

The Spanish island has also been named the most likely location for people to break-up with a partner (48 per cent).

The 'journey of love' study hopes to explores Britons' favourite locations for the different stages of love.

These include picking up a holiday fling, the most likely location to tempt you into cheating, the ideal destination to flee when nursing a broken heart and the best spot to tie the knot.

It also uncovers some of the motivations behind these choices.

The study shows that just over half 
(51 per cent) of Brits would choose a holiday fling location based on 
how romantic it is and whether it would make a nice story when they got 
home.

But romance 
appears to be forgotten when it comes to weddings abroad, as more than 
one in 20 (6 per cent) Britons confess they would choose a marriage 
destination that's most likely to make their friends jealous.

Four per cent of Britons have broken up with their partner whilst away on holiday with them

Men seem to be the sex most concerned with boasting, as this figure 
rising to almost one in 10 (9 per cent) amongst British males.

When it comes to break-ups, four per cent of Britons have broken up with their partner whilst away on holiday with them.

To deal with a break-up, almost a quarter
 (23 per cent) of Britons would choose to flee to a destination in which 
they could 'find themselves' and reflect on what went wrong in the 
relationship.

Venice is the top location for a holiday fling (18 per cent)

Paris is the ideal destination for a proposal (24 per cent) 

Barbados is the preferred spot for eloping (24 per cent) 

The Maldives is Brits' favourite wedding destination (18 per cent)

Ibiza is the location where people are most likely to break-up with a partner (48 per cent) 

New York is where Britons would flee to in order to get over broken heart (21 per cent)

A spokesperson for travel comparison website KAYAK.co.uk, who commissioned the research, said: 'We wanted to understand where, given the choice, Brits would head around the world for the different elements of the "journey of love" and the findings were certainly enlightening.

'With January being a peak time for holiday bookings, Brits should take heed of the study, particularly if a partner suggests heading to Ibiza or Paris, as it could mean a break-up or proposal is on the cards.'
