Clare Balding has been targeted by Twitter trolls for fronting BBC coverage of the Winter Olympics.

The
 presenter, who is gay, was criticised for her decision not to boycott 
the Games over Russia’s laws against the ‘promotion’ of same-sex 
relationships.

Some
 of the tweets directed at her were homophobic and one even demanded she
 be ‘buried alive’.

A law introduced last year banning gay ‘propaganda’ 
in Russia has outraged international opinion and led to calls for a 
boycott.

But
 Miss Balding, who is anchoring the BBC’s coverage of the Games, has 
said: ‘The best way of enlightening societies that are not as 
open-minded as our own is not to be cowed into submission.’

This week the 43-year-old faced a renewed barrage of criticism online.

One Twitter user, David Johnson, said: ‘She is a total sell-out. She would probably do anything for the right money.’

Another, writing under the name @anthonyb96293, said: ‘Clare Balding should be buried alive the fat dike [sic].’

Miss Balding did not defend herself against the worst of the abuse, leaving it to her partner Alice Arnold to respond. 

The
 50-year-old, who retired as a BBC newsreader last year, called Mr 
Johnson a ‘homophobic bully’ and said he was ‘talking utter rot’.

When
 he defended himself by pointing out he was criticising her decision to 
go to Sochi, not her sexuality, she said: ‘You don’t see the irony in 
attacking the only gay person going – believe me she could earn far more
 staying at home.’

Clare Balding's civil partner retweeted a homophobic comment from Twitter user @Anthonyb96293, who later apologised and removed his tweet, citing a lapse in judgement

In response to @anthonyb96293, she said: ‘Just to remind us that Russia is not the only country with homophobes.’

He quickly apologised for his tweet, admitting it was disgraceful and saying: ‘Sorry about the comment, totally out of order.’

Miss Arnold added: ‘Be warned, people who attack Clare – I will defend her. It is my right, my duty, and my vow.’

Miss
 Balding replied to some of the more measured tweets herself, saying 
participating and voicing opposition to homophobia was better than a 
boycott.

One
 Twitter user, @Pazbob, told her: ‘Bit of advice. Staying home would 
make you braver still, and grant you a place in LGBT history.’

Twitter was flooded with high-praise for the sports presenter as soon as she began coverage this afternoon

Miss
 Balding replied: ‘No, I’d make more at home, be safer and have an 
easier life. The reason I’m here is to do my job. Visibility before 
avoidance #pride.’

She added: ‘I am glad I came. Would have been easier to avoid but the easy option isn’t always the right one.’

Miss
 Balding and Miss Arnold have been together for a decade and became 
civil partners seven years ago. After the gay marriage Bill was passed 
last year, Miss Balding revealed they plan to tie the knot.
