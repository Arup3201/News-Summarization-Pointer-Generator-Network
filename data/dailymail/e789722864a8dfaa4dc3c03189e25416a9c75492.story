They were born in two different years.

But they are identical twin sisters.

Meet Hannah and Danielle Reed, who were born a minute apart and have just turned one.

Hannah Grace - who was delivered via cesarean section at 11.59pm on New Year's Eve 2013 - celebrated her birthday with a family dinner, presents and a cupcake on Wednesday evening.

The following day, Danielle Lyn - who was born just 40 seconds after midnight on New Year's Day 2014, making her the first baby of that year in Abilene, Texas - celebrated hers with the same ritual.

Their mother, Veronic Reed, who works in the Air Force, said the girls will share a birthday party for friends and family on Sunday - but each will get her own theme, according to ABC.

Hannah will have a 'Winter Wonderland' theme, while Danielle will have a 'Sugar Plum Fairy' one.

Mrs Reed said her daughters are growing up well, saying: 'They’re just perfect. They're healthy. They have eight teeth each. Danny's crawling and around here, and Hannah's well on her way.'

However, she said they have very different personalities - Danielle is 'on the go all the time from sun up until sun down' while her older sister is quieter and more reflective.

But she added: 'They both love to laugh and play and clap. And they love music.'

Mrs Reed stunned medics by carrying Hannah and Danielle to full term after they underwent an in utero procedure in August 2013. She gave birth via C-section at Abilene Regional Medical Center.

Just months after the delivery, the mother-of-two was deployed to the African country of Djibouti with the Air Force, where she stayed for around four months.

Speaking to KRBC upon her return, she said: 'Everywhere I go, it's like, "These are the New Year babies!". I wouldn't change it for anything in the whole world.' 

She added that because of her absence last year, Hannah and Danielle like to pretend they are on the phone, saying: 'They immediately put their hand to their ear like they’re on the telephone.'

To celebrate the twins' birthdays, Mrs Reed also took part in a shoot by Delilah Kay Photography, during which the girls posed in a makeshift Christmas-themed tent beside a sack of presents.
