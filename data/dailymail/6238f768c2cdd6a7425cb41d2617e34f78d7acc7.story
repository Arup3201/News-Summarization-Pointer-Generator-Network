Fresh footage of the nightmare faced by drivers stranded during heavy snowfall has emerged as one of the UK's busiest motorways ground to a halt during a blizzard in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Some drivers were stuck for as long as eight hours on the M6 between junctions 25 and 27 between Wigan and Chorley in Lancashire after a sudden deluge of snow.

But as the footage shows, not everyone was willing to sit tight and wait for driving conditions to improve.

In a hurry: While most motorists took the sensible option of sitting out the snow until driving conditions improved, some motorists, including the driver of this lorry, left, decided to speed through four inches of snow on the hard shoulder of the M6

Impatient: The lorry is pictured flying up the hard shoulder spraying waiting cars with snow

Following suit: Seeing the progress made by the lorry, a white van follows suit flying up the hard shoulder of the M6

Reckless: It's not just the hard shoulder that drivers are using to get ahead, a white van drives up the snow covered fast lane on the M6 on Friday night

Treacherous: A huge tailback of traffic pictured stranded on the M6 motorway late on Friday night after heavy snowfall

Chaos: The M6 motorway was blocked in both directions between junctions 25 and 27 in Lancashire when a sudden burst of more than a foot of snow brought drivers to a standstill around 8.30pm, the Highways Agency said

The footage shows several drivers, including one in a heavy haulage vehicle flying down the hard shoulder of the M6 trying to beat the giant tailbacks.

The motorway ground to a halt at around 8.30pm on Friday night after light sleet turned into a heavy snow drift which brought more than a foot of snow.

Some drivers helped other motorists, while others took the time to have friendly snowball fights or build snowmen on the carriageway.

But as the footage shows other people were a little bit more desperate to get to their final destination.

Eye witnesses reported that a number of vehicles tried to drive around the blocked traffic using the hard shoulder but ended up crashing in the bad weather causing further tailbacks.

Other drivers said that some drivers were so desperate to move that their cars were sliding from side to side, colliding with other vehicles.

Chief Inspector Mike Adamson said: 'We realised at about 11pm (on Friday night) that this was going to be a major incident.

'Some of the drivers and passengers have been stuck for hours - it has been a very difficult night for them.

'We have set up a command centre at Charnock Services, where officers have collected hot drinks and taken them to those who are stuck.'

Mountain rescue workers walked along the four-mile stretch of the M6 in Lancashire overnight to check on the condition of drivers.

A diabetic man was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital, while an ambulance taking a female patient to Royal Preston Hospital had to be dug out of the snow by Bowland Pennine Mountain Rescue team.

Phil O'Brien, team leader of Bowland Pennine Mountain Rescue, said: 'It was potentially a very serious situation. The Highways Agency managed to get people moving at about 4.30 to 5am.

'There were hundreds of cars stuck but most people seemed in good spirits.'

But while some drivers lightheartedly entertained themselves with snowball fights and building snowmen, one woman who got stuck on the M6 travelling home to Bootle from Wigan described the it as the 'scariest experience' she had had in 26 years of driving.

Louise Jones, who spent five hours on the motorway making the 20 mile trip home, told ITV: 'We did not move at all, three lanes of cars were totally gridlocked. For the first three hours we left the engine running to keep warm, then turned it off and every car we could see was just sitting in the darkness, it was really eerie how silent it was.

'Eventually a snow plough drove along the hard shoulder at about 1am, then we saw nothing moving until a police car at 1.40am.

Too dangerous: A car is left abandoned on a slip road beside junction 25 of the M6 in Lancashire

Abandoned: The driver of this car decided it was too dangerous to continue trying to drive and abandoned their car next to a slip road on the M6

'It really was horrendous. I can't understand why it took so long to clear enough space to direct traffic through. It was a total farce.'

Lancashire Police also worked with Lancashire Mountain Rescue teams, the Highways Agency and neighbouring force Greater Manchester Police to clear roads and provide welfare assistance to those who were stranded.

The Highway Agency worked throughout the night to clear the routes with snow ploughs.

Kevin Collister, who was stuck on the motorway just past the M58 junction heading northbound, told Sky News: 'There is absolutely no movement whatsoever on my side of the carriageway, all the snow is squashed down into ice and there are wagons trying to move and sliding sideways.'

He described how his 45 minute journey ended up taking right hours and claimed there were no emergency services in sight.

He told the TV station: 'It was very heavy snow and absolute chaos. It was absolutely freezing.

'We saw one Highways Agency car drive past us and that was all.

On the move: The M6 was moving again yesterday morning after some drivers were stranded for as long as eight hours overnight on Friday

Scene: The M6 was closed between junction 25 and 27

'It was only good Samaritans like us who went around to check on other drivers and make sure they were okay.'

'Everyone knew we were going to be there for a few hours so we all just made the best of it. People were having snowball fights over the central reservation and building snowmen to pass the time.

'I eventually got home at 6am this morning so was stuck for about ten hours.'

Another person claimed a burger van stranded on the M6 started serving food to other drivers stuck on the M6.

Paul Kingston tweeted: 'Motorists caught in M6 #uksnow storm in Lancs last night were saved from hunger, after stranded burger van opens up shop on carriageway.'

Conservative MP for Morecambe & Lunesdale David Morris, who was stuck on the southbound carriageway, reported surreal scenes but a camaraderie among the drivers stuck in the snow.

He told Mail Online: 'The snow just came out of nowhere -'I've never seen anything like it in my life.

'I set off around 8pm to go and pick up my son from Manchester and there was a little bit of sleet

'But when I got on the M6 it just came down really suddenly. I'd already seen several gritters on the road but there was so much snow in such a short space of time there was little they could do.

'The traffic ground to a halt as the snow got heavier and we just started to get snowed in.

'The emergency services were fantastic and the Mountain Rescue Service and police were driving up and down the hard shoulder checking on people while they worked on getting the traffic flowing again.

'A few people have asked me if I don't think the gritters should have done a better a job but I don't think there's more they could have done. There was so much snow that the grit had little impact.'
