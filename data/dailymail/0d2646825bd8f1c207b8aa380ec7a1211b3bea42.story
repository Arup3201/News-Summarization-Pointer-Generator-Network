Just because you can't carry a gun, it doesn't mean you can't wear one.

That's the theme of a startling new line of T-shirts on sale in the U.S.  labelled 'a real conversation starter' by  producers.

The 'open carry T-shirts' range is a nod to the open carry movement in the U.S. which campaigns for the right to openly carry properly holstered handguns in daily American life.

Bold look: Colorado company Nitelife are producing T-shirts with photo-quality guns holstered from the arm in support of pro-gun movement 'open carry'

Glamorous: T-shirts come in a range of bright colors and are labelled 'a real conversation starter'

Law: Restrictions on openly carrying guns in the U.S. differ from state to state

Warning: The T-shirts come with a stark set of warnings to avoid being shot by police in the street

Rules about openly carrying weapons differ from state to state.

But activists who feel oppressed by restrictive gun laws can now make their point through a collection of colourful tops with photo-quality images of handguns hanging from the arms, reports Vocative.

But the T-shirts - which start at $16.99 - come with a warning from Nitelife, based in Grand Junction, Colorado.

In bold luminous writing on the company's website it says: "At a Short Distance … The GUN … LOOKS REAL!

"Law Enforcement Officers May Over-React To YOUR Shirt. Be Responsible. Obey ALL Orders, HALT! FREEZE! STOP! … IMMEDIATELY.”

“Do NOT … REACH TOWARDS … The Holster and Gun! YOUR ACTIONS Could Get YOU, Injured Or Even KILLED!"
