Hackers have shut down Al Qaeda's communication network, crippling the group's ability to send messages and videos around the world using the internet.

After terrorising US and UK government and intelligence networks in recent weeks, the computer activists finally appear to have switched tactics, now targeting the major enemy of the West.

'Al Qaeda's online communications have been temporarily crippled, and it
 does not have a single trusted distribution channel available on the 
Internet,' Evan Kohlmann, of Flashpoint Global Partners, which 
monitors the group's communications, announced.

The attack on Al Qaeda's network was carried out in the last few days and was 'well 
coordinated and involved the use of an unusual cocktail of relatively 
sophisticated techniques,' Kohlmann told MSNBC.

'My guess is that it will take them at least several days more to repair
 the damage and get their network up and functioning again.'

This is the second time the group has been subject to large scale online infiltration in just over a year.

The UK government hacked into an Al Qaeda website last year, replacing bomb-making instructions with recipes for making cupcakes.

Meanwhile, the FBI has raided the home of a woman in Iowa as it continues its investigation into hacking group LulzSec.

At least eight agents turned up on Laurelai Bailey's doorstep and spent five hours interviewing her about her connections with the hackers, who have attacked high-profile targets including Sony, the FBI and the CIA.

Miss Bailey was not arrested, but her admission to having spent time with the hackers online was enough to get her fired from her job at a tech support company in Davenport.

Closing in: The homepage of disbanded hacking group LolzSec. The FBI is stepping up its investigation after members wreaked havoc across the internet

The raid is a sign the FBI are trying to close in on LulzSec, a splinter group of elite hackers from the more benign network, Anonymous.

LulzSec announced they were disbanding on Saturday after 50 days in which they wreaked havoc across the internet.

All six alleged members had been identified by rival hackers, and last week one of them, British 19-year-old Ryan Cleary, was charged with allegedly hacking into Soca, the UK's equivalent of the FBI.

But one member used Skype to tell the Associated Press: 'We're not quitting because we're afraid of law enforcement. The press are getting bored of us, and we're getting bored of us.'

The FBI has now stepped up its attempts to track them down, and is believed to be speaking to anyone who has ever associated with the group online.

Miss Bailey, 29, told Gawker she opened her door at 11am last Thursday to find eight FBI agents on her doorstep, holding a search warrant.

Publicity: LulzSec revelled in their newfound fame, and used Twitter to promote their cyber-attacks up until they disbanded last weekend

In January, Miss Bailey was in a chatroom talking to members of LulzSec as they carried out a cyberattack on security firm HBGary.

She claims she was reporting on the attack for Crowdleaks, a site similar to Wikileaks, and insists she was never a member of LulzSec.

Miss Bailey told Gawker the agents were particularly interested in a LulzSec hacker called 'Kayla', who is believed to be a woman, and even asked her to infiltrate the group.

She said: 'They wanted to know if I could get close to them. I told them these people hate me.'

According to Miss Bailey, the group hold a grudge against her after she released the chat logs from the HBGary attack.

After the interview, the agents confiscated her hard drives, camera and other computer equipment.

She lost her job soon afterwards when she told an online friend about the raid, and they published her real name and contact details online, portraying her as a Lulzsec 'snitch'.

She told Gawker: 'They fired me... because I was apparently making the company look bad.'Â 

Meanwhile police in Arizona are continuing their investigation after the
 elite band of hackers gained access to the state's Department of Public
 Safety email servers.

Unlike the larger group, Anonymous, LulzSec seemed to revel in their new-found fame, gaining more than 280,000 Twitter followers and being publicised in mainstream and tech media alike.

While Anonymous usually attacks political targets, like Robert Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe, LulzSec seemed to create mayhem just because they could.

Over the 50-day period, the group claimed hacks on major 
entertainment companies, FBI partner organisations, the CIA, the US 
Senate and a pornography website.

They also hacked Fox.com and published dozens of logs from British ATMs.
