Alexis Tsipras may have been described as the ‘Greek Che Guevara’ but many believe 'Betty' – the new Greek Prime Minister's partner for 20 years – is the true radical.

Peristera Batziana, who is the mother of his two children, encouraged the 40-year-old to enter politics when he was apparently more into sport.

They were fellow engineering students and Miss Batziana convinced him to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990 despite his middle-class background.

Power couple: Peristera 'Betty' Batziana convinced Greece's new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990 after they had met three years earlier at high school in Athens

Publicity-shy: The couple, who graduated from university as engineers, are rarely seen together in public

Within a year, they were leading a revolt in Athens against unpopular education reforms.

The new Prime Minister has deliberately kept his family out of the limelight as he led his anti-austerity Syriza party into power.

But many believe the strong willed Betty, who has been at his side for more than 20 years, may become the power behind the throne.

Mr Tsipras was born into a bourgeois family and before meeting Miss Batziana was more interested in sports than politics.

Then a knee injury kept him out of sport. That coincided with him meeting Miss Batziana, a fellow student who convinced him to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990.

A year later, when the students of Athens revolted against unpopular education reforms, the pair, as leaders of the movement, led protests at the Ampelokipoi Branch High School.

Changing direction: A knee injury kept Mr Tsipras out of sport at the same time as he met Miss Batziana, a fellow student who convinced him to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990

Couple: Mr Tsipras and Ms Batziana got together in 1987 when they were at high school together in Athens

Pupils ate and slept at the school and Mr Tsipras told an interviewer at the time: ‘We want the right to judge for ourselves whether to skip class.’

They both went on to attend the National Technical University of Athens and became engineers.

According to friends from the University of Patras, where Miss Batziana graduated in electrical engineering, she is strong-willed, militant and dynamic.

She once took one of her professors to court when he tried undermine her work on a doctoral thesis, it was reported by the Greek Reporter.

She also hates spending hours shopping and doesn’t like going for regular trips to the hairdresser.

Miss Batziana avoids the media spotlight and the couple have made very few public appearances.

They live in a flat in a seven-storey apartment block in Kypseli - a modest, working-class area of Athens.

Humble: The ramshackle block of flats where Tsipras and his partner, Betty Batziana, an electrical and computer engineer, live with their two children in one of the most densely populated areas of Athens

New home: The couple will now have to get used to the opulent surroundings of the Maximos Mansion

Wave: New Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on the steps of the century-old official residence in Athens

Once a brash motorbike-riding Communist activist, Mr Tsipras preferred to take advantage of the cohabitation law that has been in effect since 2009 rather than get married at the courthouse or the church.

The unconventional political leader - regarded as a true man of the people – takes out the rubbish, is an avid football fan and puts their boys, Phoebus and Orpheus, to bed.

His youngest son’s middle name is Ernesto – a tribute to Che Guevara, one of his idols.

There will be one major change, as the family swaps their modest working-class home for Athens' Prime Ministerial palace.

With its grand portico and white marble columns, the opulent Maximos Mansion has been the official residence of Greek Prime Ministers since 1982.

It could be a culture shock for a leader who has lived so far as a man of the people.

Avoiding the perks of political life, Mr Tsipras still opts to get around on a motorbike, flies economy and has never been seen wearing a tie.

In the weeks before Sunday’s momentous election, the question of whether he would opt to wear a tie as Prime Minister was widely asked.

Invariably Mr Tsipras replied no, ‘After all,’ he joked ‘I didn’t wear one to see the Pope.’
