It is the world’s largest indoor beach with 400 sunloungers - and not a cloud in sight.

Yet with up to 6,000 visitors allowed in at a time, there are bound to be towel-fights over them – especially as this 'indoors paradise' is in Germany.

The Tropical Island Resort in Krausnick, south of Berlin also boasts the largest indoor pool, 50,000-plant forest - and enough space to fly a hot air balloon inside.

The former aircraft hangar has been transformed into a paradise offering tourists a tropical escape, if you can ignore the fact that you are miles from any ocean - or the tropics, for that matter.

It's sunny indoors: The tropical island paradise in in Brandenburg, Germany is inside a building so big it could easily fit eight football pitches

Bored with the beach? A spa, waterfall, whirlpools and water slides are just a few of the attractions inside the old airship hanger

Paradise lost (but you might find it indoors): The tropical island boasts an air temperature of 26C, with not a cloud in sight

Not a cloud in sight: Inside the paradise there is the world's biggest indoor 'rainforest', which features over 50,000 plants and spans over a 10,000 metre square area

'Beach resort': Fountains surround the little palaces, where you can stay overnight if it takes your fancy

Somewhere for dinner? The restaurants offer a view of the beach, rainforest, and ... a roof

Time for a drink? A nightclub-style bar keeps the cocktails flowing, but sadly there's no view of the stars from the terrace

The gigantic hangar was built to produce transport zeppelins but after the company went bankrupt in 1992 the hangar fell into disuse.

A Malaysian company saw the potential in the hangar, which is the world’s largest freestanding building, and Tropical Island Resort opened in 2004.

Despite the impressive interior of the hot hangar, visitors reviewing the indoor tropical resort on reddit complained about high prices on everything from beverages to accommodation and additional fees to use the popular water slides.

Some users went as far as to vent their disappointment in the type of crowd attracted by the tropical escape.

proportion of the audience is folks who'd love to fly to the beach but 
can't afford it... and it shows,’ complaining about ‘Mallorca youths  - 
loud, obnoxious, inebriated, strutting about as if they owned the 
place.’

‘It's nice for families with small kids, but we weren't overwhelmed (3 people in our late 20s)’ another Reddit user said.

’There simply wasn't much fun stuff to do all day, just the pools, even the mediocre slides cost extra.’

The
 resort, located on an old World War II runway, keeps a pleasant 
temperature of 26C, thanks to the modified 70,000 square metre 
dome allowing sunlight to shine through massive windows.

And naturally, if it rains or pours, a quick common can be sent to close the roof - and everyone can remain dry and happy in their tropical paradise.

Lots of room for a slide: Youngsters (and adults) can enjoy the fun of the multi-coloured slides that tower over the the 'beach' of the dome

Beach accessories: Along with the sandy beach, there is a spa, waterfall, whirlpools and water slides - something for each of the 6,000 visitors

Blue skies (if you don't look up): A basic board sells the illusion of a horizon, although there's no effort to hide the rest of the roof

View from the outside: The dome used to be a hangar for aircraft but now, although you might not think it, it contains a whole other world

Under the dome: Restaurants and even umbrellas help complete the illusion - and not a cloud in sight

The bedrooms inside the wooden cabins allow visitors to stay overnight - under two roofs
