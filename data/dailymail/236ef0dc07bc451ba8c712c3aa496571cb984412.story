Falling book sales are behind President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama's drop in income which fell by 21 percent in 2013.

The White House released the couple's most recent federal tax return on Friday which show the Obama's reported an adjusted gross income of just over $481,000.

Although the bulk of their earnings came from the President's salary, the main cause for their drop in salary was as a result of the President Obama earning more than $150,000 less in 2013 than the previous year.

Their total earnings is a fraction of what the President was earning just four years ago when Obama's tax return showed an income of $5.5 million.

Low point: In 2013, President Obama had the lowest total income that he has had in the past three years since his book sales dropped down to less than half of what they were in 2012

Sales of the President's book dropped from $258,722 in 2012 down to $104,000 in 2013.

While his current books are still earning an income, it was expected that the royalties would lessen as time went on.

On the other hand, when Mr Obama finally leaves office in just under three years, the books that he writes will be sure to make him and his family a considerable sum of money.

Estimates are currently being made that an advance for his first book will top $15-million with further royalties on top of that.

When it comes to 2013's tax return, the couple paid $98,169 in taxes on their $481,098 income for the 
2013 fiscal year, according to details released by the White House on 
Friday.

It means they paid an effective federal income tax rate of 20.4 per cent.

By comparison, the Obamas reported income of $662,076 and paid $112,214 in federal taxes at a rate of 18.4 percent for 2012.

In 2011, they earned $844,585 
while paying $162,074 in federal taxes. After deductions, the couple's 
adjusted gross income was $608,611 in 2012 and $789,674 in 2011.

Obama's
 annual presidential salary is $400,000. He had planned to return 5 
percent of his pay in 2013 as a gesture of solidarity with federal 
government workers who faced unpaid leave amid deep spending cuts.

Obama reported $394,796 in 2013 wages, and it was not immediately clear if or how he returned any portion of those earnings.

Because
 his overall taxable income this year came in at $333,329 that keeps him
 well below the $450,000 mark where individuals begin being taxed at the
 raised 39.6 per cent rate that the President boosted in the 
'millionaire's tax' that his administration put into effect not long 
ago.

The 42-page 
document shows the Obamas reported donating $59,251 to 32 charities 
which equates to 12.3 per cent of their adjusted gross income. 

That figure is $90,000 less than the 
couple donated to charity last year, which may be a result of 
his falling book sales.

Their largest charitable gift, $8,751, went to the Fisher House Foundation, which supports military families.

Among
 the Obamas' other notable charitable contributions were $5,000 to the 
Sidwell Friends School, the exclusive private school where daughters 
Malia and Sasha are enrolled, $4,000 to the American Red Cross and 
$2,000 to One Fund Boston, which was created last year to aid victims of
 the Boston Marathon bombings.

The Obamas also released their Illinois income tax return showing they paid $23,328 in income taxes to their home state.

Separately,
 Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill paid $96,378 in federal tax 
last year on adjusted gross income of $407,009.

Giving back: The Obamas gave less to charity this year than previous years since their giving rate has always been reflective of their annual income, but they gave the most to the Fisher House Foundation which supports military families (Michelle seen at one of their events in 2012)

They paid an effective federal income tax rate of 23.7 per cent, according to their tax returns.

They paid $16,444 in taxes to their home state of Delaware.

Jill Biden, a community college professor, also paid $3,470 in income tax to Virginia, where she teaches.

The Bidens donated $20,523 to charity last year.

Obama's total income in 2013 was less than that in 2012 and 2011 

@highlight

Family paid $98,169 - a tax rate of 20.4%- on their total 2013 income of $481,098

@highlight

Ended up paying a higher tax rate, however, because they paid 18.4% in 2012 when their income was $662,076

@highlight

President Obama's book sales dropped to less than half of what they were

@highlight

Book sales accounted for $258,000 in 2012 but just $104,000 in 2013

@highlight

The couple gave less to charity as a result but still parted with 12.3%

@highlight

Avoided the 'millionaire's tax' that he implemented because his taxable income of $333,239 was less than the $450,000 cut off
