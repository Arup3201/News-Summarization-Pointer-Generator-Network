CCTV: This is the moment an armed robber's accomplice is forced to part with his coat during an alleged botched raid after the shop worker pulls it off of him during the struggle

The owner of the shop, in Wandsworth, 
south London, who did not want to be identified, said it was his brother
 who was working on the till at the time of the incident.

He said he initially thought it was a joke as he held what is believed to have been a gun and tried to move it out of his face.

He said: 'So he managed to slightly manoeuvre the guy who had both hands on his rifle and then the other guy tried to punch him.

The second alleged robber then attempts to punch the shopkeeper but he dodges the attack

'He dodged the punch and grabbed his coat and he pulled his coat on top of his head so it was hard for him to get out.

'At that time his partner who was there, he thought he was going to get caught because my brother was shouting for help so got scared and ditched the other guy there.

'Then he managed to get his coat off and ran off.'

The shop owner, who described his 
brother as 'a tough guy', said he has now been told there was a similar 
incident at a nearby shop just 15 minutes beforehand.

He said police have carried out forensic examinations at the scene.

The shop owner said his brother believed the raiders had been armed with a real gun.

He then grabs the robber's hood and starts to pull him towards the counter

He said: 'When he grabbed the gun he said it was solid and metal.'

Officers from the Flying Squad are now appealing for witnesses following the incident last night.

A police spokesman said: 'Suspect 1 approached the counter holding a gun and demanded money. A struggle took place and both suspects fled empty-handed.'

The spokesman said police believe the incident may be linked to a robbery committed about 15 minutes previously at another shop.

The spokesman said the first suspect is a black male aged about 25 and about 6ft tall.

He was wearing a black and grey scarf covering his face. He was wearing a black jacket with hooded top.

The second suspect is a white male,between 20 and 25, and about 5ft 11 tall. He was wearing a green parka-style coat and light-coloured Adidas tracksuit bottoms.
