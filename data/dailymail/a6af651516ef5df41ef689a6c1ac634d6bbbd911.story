Liverpool and Chelsea meet on Tuesday evening in the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final, thus continuing a fierce modern rivalry that has thrown up many thrilling contests.

There has been no shortage of controversial incidents in the last few years, from Luis Garcia's 'ghost goal' to Luis Suarez biting Branislav Ivanovic. 

And in the build-up to the match, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers admitted the rivalry is now so intense he can no longer be close friends with opposite number Jose Mourinho. 

But it's a match that doesn't quite compare to the great traditional rivalries of the British game, the ones akin to two tribes going to war.

So with apologies to the good people of Sheffield, Bristol, Grimsby, Lincoln, Norwich, Ipswich, Watford, Luton, Wolverhampton, West Bromwich, Birmingham, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Dundee and Edinburgh, here's our rundown of the nation's bitterest football rivalries.

Celtic v Rangers

If there really is one rivalry in British football that genuinely is about more than sport then this it. Religion, national identity and history all play a part in what has become known as the Old Firm.

The strength of feeling has certainly led to some remarkable scenes on the football pitch but, sadly, too many away from the action that we would rather forget.

Manchester United v Liverpool

United – given their size, success and location – have more rivalries than they care to think about. Ask their supporters for their feelings about Manchester City and Leeds, for example, and stand back and prepare to listen. 

This is the only one that really counts, though. As Sir Alex Ferguson used to say: ‘Liverpool always have been, and always will be, our greatest rivals’. 

Music, culture, the Manchester Ship Canal. If there is an argument to be had about something, the citizens of these two great cities will have it.

When it comes to football, however, the fundamentals remain the same. Years of chasing the same trophies and trying to buy the same players so that they could boast the same thing – ‘We are the best in Europe’ – have taken a deep toll. 

The rivalry is deep, it is real, it is bitter and it will never change.

Burnley v Blackburn

Former Blackburn manager – and one-time Barcelona centre forward – Mark Hughes once described this rivalry as 'greater than that between Barcelona and Real Madrid'. 

From that point of view, it’s worth taking seriously and its credentials for respect are also hardened by the fact its England’s oldest derby, dating back to 1888.

At first glance, both towns have much in common. They are only eight miles apart, both have been floored by the gradual erosion and decline of the north’s great industries and both – as a result – are patronised and ridiculed by the likes of nearby Manchester and Liverpool.

Perhaps this is just it, though. When nobody else cares about you, what other option is there other than to care about each other?

Newcastle v Sunderland

To many, it’s parochial and rather meaningless. After all, neither of these two clubs have won a meaningful trophy since Sunderland lifted the FA Cup almost 42 years ago. 

However, the mutual hatred between these two cities is another that transcends football. This one is about coal, politics and regional pride.

If you don’t believe me then google ‘the Battle of Boldon Hill’ (it took place in 1644) and consider the fact that some people in Newcastle still refuse to eat bacon. Why? Because it’s red and white. Kind of.

Cardiff v Swansea

In 1988, having seen their team win in Swansea, a group of Cardiff fans were actually chased in to the sea by supporters of the home team. That fact, in itself, gives this rivalry a unique story to tell. 

Five years later, though, things grew a little more serious when Swansea fans tore seats from the stand at Ninian Park and began to throw them at their rivals. 

A pitch invasion followed and, as a result, away fans were banned from these games for several years. Interestingly, there is little history to this rivalry beyond football. 

In 1927, for example, many Swansea fans actually travelled to Wembley to cheer Cardiff on against Arsenal in the FA Cup Final. Things only got heated in the 1980s as football hooliganism began to take a grip of the UK.

Nottingham Forest v Derby County

Forest have their own neighbours, of course. You had probably hit a six iron from the centre circle of the City Ground and locate your ball in Notts County’ s car park a few minutes later. 

County, though, are not even on Forest’s radar when compared to their feelings with their other local foes from down the A52. 

Again there is a manufacturing argument at its roots – this time a row over the production of lace that goes back to the Industrial Revolution – but it was the great Brian Clough’s switch from Derby to Forest in the 1970s that really got this one off the ground. 

As events at Pride Park on Saturday showed, the hate goes on….

Tottenham v Arsenal

The highest scoring derby in the Premier League, this one has its roots in geography, with the clubs’ stadia being just four miles apart.

In recent times, people like George Graham and Sol Campbell have managed and played for both clubs, deepening the enmity. 

Many supporters won’t know, though, that the clubs have been arguing with each other since 1919 when Arsenal – rather than Tottenham - were voted in to an expanded First Division, despite finishing six places further down the old league structure.

Portsmouth v Southampton

Not surprisingly, given their coastal locations, this rivalry is predominantly about boats.

Mutual dislike and suspicion between two ports located 30 miles apart has been around for centuries but historians pinpoint the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 as a key moment in time. 

Sailors from Southampton refused to crew her sister ship Olympic, due to the lack of lifeboats. Dockers from Portsmouth had no such issue, though, arriving in Southampton in the middle of the night to effectively take their work.

When looked at like this, Harry Redknapp’s flitting between the two clubs ten years ago suddenly doesn't look like such a big deal.

Chester v Wrexham

This one may now continue its life outside the Football League structure but on it goes, so much so that both sets of supporters still arrive at each other’s grounds on match day under heavy police escort. 

North Wales police actually claim that this fixture carries with it a greater risk of hooliganism than the Manchester derby. The fact that one of these towns is in England and the other is in Wales doesn’t help, of course…..

Millwall v West Ham

Back in the day the supporters of these clubs were largely dockers and ship yard workers competing for the same business on the same stretch of the Thames. 

So it was that the sporting – and often not very sporting – rivalry between Millwall Athletic and Thames Ironworks was born. 

When Millwall moved south of the river in 1910, the two clubs were no longer East End neighbours but the rivalry remained. In the 1960s and 1970s members of the criminal fraternity infiltrated the scene too. Occasionally some football was played.
