Louis van Gaal was quick to praise the fighting spirit of his Manchester United team after Daley Blind has scraped a late - and barely deserved - draw at West Ham on Sunday. '(United) showed a lot of resilience in the second-half... I must say what spirit from my team,’ enthused the Dutchman.

But the reality is that United have shown precious little 'spirit' or 'resilience' this season - with the notable exception of goalkeeper David de Gea, who has bailed them out of trouble on many an occasion.

Despite Van Gaal's praise, under his leadership United have not won a single game in the Barclays Premier League after conceding the first goal of a match.

Unitd have not fought back to win at any point this season, including during this defeat by Southampton

This season United have let slip the first goal of the game on eight occasions. The best results Van Gaal's men have salvaged from these fixtures were draws against West Brom, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Stoke and West Ham. The other three games ended in defeats by Swansea, Manchester City and Southampton.

It is all a stark contrast from the halcyon days under Sir Alex Ferguson's management, when United were famed for their fighting spirit, often scoring decisive goals in the dying moments after the referee's watch had ticked beyond 90 minutes.

'Fergie Time' has gone down in legend. The most memorable of all United's last-gasp goals are arguably Steve Bruce's two headers against Sheffield Wednesday in 1993. The late double averted a defeat during a crucial stage of the title race and kept United on course for their first league crown in 26 years.  Ferguson and his assistant Brian Kidd danced on the Old Trafford turf in delight.

And while they were not Premier League strikes, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's injury-time goals against Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final may never be beaten for jaw-dropping drama or sheer bloody-mindedness.

But even after Ferguson's retirement, under the much-maligned David Moyes the Red Devils managed to fight back and win from a losing position on four occasions. And the Scot did not even complete a full season in charge at Old Trafford. 

United's reputation as comeback kings reached its zenith during Ferguson's final season at the helm. In 2012-13 they fought back to win from a losing position on NINE occasions, the highest number during any of the Scot's 26 years in charge.

The previous best seasons for United fightbacks were in 1999-2000 and 2002-03, when six matches were won from behind.

Ferguson's United did, however, fail to win a single match when conceding the first goal during two full terms.

That said, during one of those seasons United managed arguably their greatest fightback of all - but not in a single match. Trailing by 12 points at one stage in 1995-96, United reeled in league leaders Newcastle and left Kevin Keegan ranting how he would 'love it' if he were to beat Fergie to the title. He didn't and nothing better summed up the mental fortitude of the Ferguson era.

By comparison, a late draw at West Ham renders Van Gaal's claims to 'resiliance' somewhat feeble.
