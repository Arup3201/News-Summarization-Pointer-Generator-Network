Phil Taylor clinched his sixth Grand Slam of Darts title on Sunday and dedicated the victory to his ill mother, who is in hospital with a lung infection.

The Power needed to be at his best to see off Dave Chisnall in the final and eventually ran out a 16-13 winner in Wolverhampton.

He told PDC.tv: 'I'm going to take the trophy up to the hospital with me and leave it at my mum's bedside - she'll be asleep when I get there but it will be a nice surprise for her when she wakes up tomorrow.

'It's been very tough recently with her being in hospital, but this week's been a little bit of escapism. My mind goes blank for that two or three hours while I'm playing, and I've loved it.'

Taylor went through the group stage in Wolverhampton unbeaten before seeing off Peter Wright, Michael Smith and Mervyn King en route to Sunday's final.

'I'm chuffed to bits,' Taylor said. 'It was very, very tough and Dave didn't give up - he showed that he's an incredible player.

'If he'd started off the game like he finished it then it would have been a different kettle of fish. I don't know what he did but he turned the tables, and the next thing I knew it was ten-each.

'In my mind I knew I was far ahead but Dave kept coming back at me. When it got to ten-each his confidence was sky high, but I didn't think he could keep doing it.

'He put me under so much pressure but I had to slow down, take a deep breath and I managed to get there in the end.'

Runner-up Chisnall said: 'I'm happy with my performance over the last week but the final got away from me at the beginning. You can't give Phil Taylor a 5-0 lead, and even though I've been further behind this week Phil was too good in the end.

'When I got to ten-all I thought I could take the win, but I missed a double to pull back to 12-11 and when it got to 15-10 it was a struggle. It was never over until he hit the final double and I kept fighting hard, but the better man won.'
