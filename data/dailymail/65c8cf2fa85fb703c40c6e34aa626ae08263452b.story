Questions were being asked last night about the effectiveness of Ebola screening after it emerged the infected nurse had been vetted twice.

The woman was screened in both Sierra Leone and London but her symptoms were not detected.

Professor Jonathan Ball, an expert in molecular virology at Nottingham University, said the case showed the procedure was unable to spot Ebola.

He said this was because symptoms such as a high temperature can take up to three weeks to develop. 'When [screening] was introduced it was more a measure of reassurance rather than something that actually worked,' he said. 

'Because the incubation period for Ebola is up to 21 days, it's impossible to detect as you don't show symptoms.' 

In October, ministers were accused of a chaotic response to the Ebola crisis when it emerged screening measures amounted to little more than a questionnaire. 

The tests involve assessing passengers' recent travel history and who they have been in contact with, as well as a possible medical assessment. Passengers who have come from Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea are put in a separate queue at customs.

In a holding area, they are asked how they are feeling, whether they have been in contact with Ebola victims and if they have touched bush meat. 

If the medical staff are concerned, they start a full assessment. But they stop short of screening passengers with thermal guns to pick out those with an elevated temperature, a procedure adopted in the US.

Health chiefs will be disturbed that the nurse was able to travel on a plane after developing symptoms.

Spreading from person to person as a result of direct contact with skin or bodily fluids such as blood or sweat, the deadly virus is extremely infectious.

However the afflicted nurse's fellow passengers on her flight to London are unlikely to have contracted it because it is not airborne. 

They would not be at risk from breathing the same cabin air and it would be exceptionally unlucky to catch it from an armrest, a touch-screen television or a seat-back tray.

But there will be concern over anyone who may have had close contact with the woman – such as her partner – and for any health officials who treated her after she became ill but before she was diagnosed. 

The virus can enter the body via infected droplets through broken skin or mucous membranes such as the eyes or the lining of the nose.

Ferociously infectious while inside a human body or bodily fluid, it is far less so on an inert surface where it lasts for no longer than a few minutes.

But guidelines on tackling Ebola say a carpet or seat cover that is dirty from blood or body fluids should be discarded in the same way as biohazardous material. 

Precautions: William Pooley starts his journey home from Sierra Leone in an air isolation unit 

To avoid catching the disease, medical workers must wear goggles, incinerate clothing and clinical waste and decontaminate medical equipment that needs to be kept.

When she arrives at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London, the health worker will be admitted through a specially-assigned hospital entrance, before being taken to the high-level isolation unit – the only ward in the UK equipped to cope with ebola.

It is the same unit that nursed fellow British nurse William Pooley back to health after he contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone in August. 

The latest victim will occupy a £25,000 bed that will be burned after she leaves the hospital. 

An intravenous drip will pump saline solution into her body to stop the organs failing. Doctors will also treat the bleeding from her nose, eyes and ears.

If they cannot get hold of experimental Ebola drug ZMapp, they will simply try to manage the disease until her immune system is strong enough to fight it off. 

A filtration system will suck the air away, removing all contaminated vapour before it is pumped out of the building.
