Sent anonymously to the Boston Globe, this cardboard box of human remains has helped to shed fresh light on a mystery that has endured for almost 40 years.

A note inside - from a sender identified only as 'Veritas' - asked the newspaper to find out who the bones belonged to, and pointed it towards the disappearance of two young couples who vanished at sea back in 1976.

Danny Kwiatkowski, 24, and his sister Elaine, 20, together with their respective dates Jana Coonan, 16, and 26-year-old Daniel Poirier, set out on a fishing trip off Plymouth, Cape Cod, over the Memorial Day weekend, and never returned.

Lasting mystery: Mailed by somebody using the name 'Veritas', the cardboard box that arrived at The Boston Globe offices was found to contain two human skulls

The Coast Guard discovered 24-year-old Danny Kwiatkowski's motorboat floating partially submerged off the coast of Marshfield, with two pairs of shoes, Elaine's purse and some soft drinks the only trace of those that had been on board.

The boat was later found to be still seaworthy, and three life jackets and a distress flare were recovered unused. The foursome's baited fishing rods were still attached to the side of the vessel.

It was concluded that both young couples had succumbed to the icy temperatures of the Atlantic after their boat got into trouble, but the families of the missing four never gave up hope that the missing boaters would be found.

'We feel their has been foul play,' Joseph Kwiatkowski, Danny and Elaine's brother, told a newspaper in June 1976.

Their relatives - conscious that all four were strong swimmers - scoured the shoreline of Cape Cod Bay, before expanding their search further, giving television interviews and eventually seeking the advice of psychics as years went past with no clues.

Clues: The package included official paperwork related to the foursome's disappearance, and a message insisting 'this is not a Halloween prank'

A leg recovered by a fishing trawler 
towards the end of 1976 was still inside a high leather boot that 
contained Danny Kwiatkowski's wallet, and his family buried it in Notre 
Dame Cemetery in Worcester.

But it was not until the mysterious 
package arrived at the Boston Globe offices last autumn - containing 
remains from two humans, paperwork connected to the vanished boaters, 
and a note which insisting 'this is now a Halloween prank' - that more 
emerged about the foursome's fate.

Paperwork inside the box indicated 
that the medical examiner suspected one of the skulls could belong to 
either Jana Coonan or Elaine Kwiaktowski - but in the days before DNA 
testing he had no way to be sure.

The other set of remains were thought to belong to a Native American woman.

The remains would have been disposed 
of were it not for an employee at the state crime lab who decided to 
send them to Veritas for safekeeping, according to the Boston Globe's 
report.

'Please see that justice is now done for the sake of these two victims,' Veritas wrote.

In the wake of the arrival of the box
Massachusetts Police and Globe reporters embarked on separate 
investigations into the disappearance of the boaters.

Hope through the years: Police used DNA testing to identify one set of remains as those of Jana Coonan, the 16-year-old sister of Michael Coonan (pictured), who never gave up hope that his sibling might have survived

Disappearance: Siblings Danny and Elaine Kwiatkowski and their dates Jana Coonan and Daniel Poirier vanished during a boating trip off Cape Cod on Memorial Day weekend in 1976

Using a DNA sample collected from a 
single tooth remaining in the unidentified skull suspected to be that of
one of the missing boaters.

In December, genetic material was 
collected from Danny and Elaine's sister Marge Habib, Jana Coonan's 
brother Michael, and Pamela DePaoli, sister of Daniel Poirier.

After an agonising six month wait, investigators contacted Mr Coonan to inform him the school was that of his sister, Jana.

'Until I got the 
phone call . . . I always kind of expected to see her walking down the 
street,' he says

After notifying the families 
involved, the case was closed again, but not before samples collected 
from the relatives of the unaccounted for boaters, Elaine Kwiatkowski 
and Daniel Poirier, were logged in a missing person's database in case 
their remains should ever be unearthed.

The other remains inside the box were
found to be between 400 and 500 years old and from two different 
people. A state archaeologist is now trying to establish which Native 
American tribes the remains can be traced back to.

Efforts to trace Veritas by both police and the Boston Globe have proved fruitless.

The family of Daniel Poirier accepts 
he probably died in the boating accident, but long for the sense of 
'closure' that physical evidence has brought to the Jana Coonan's 
relatives.

'I wish there was a way we could have put it to rest and we never did,' Daniel's older sister Pamela said.
