This September is looking set to be the driest since 1959 - and forecasters predict October could be just as parched with 30 more rain free days expected.

The UK has experienced less than a quarter of its usual rainfall - with just 22.5 mm of rain recorded up until September 25, against a monthly average of 96 mm.

The driest September ever recorded was in 1959 when just 23.8 mm of rain fell over the entire month.

This month has been so dry that a hidden village in Cumbria which vanished in the 1930s is slowly rising from its watery grave.

Mardale Green, in Cumbria, disappeared in 1935 when the valley was flooded to make way for the Haweswater Reservoir, which would later serve Manchester with water.

Beach-goers made the most of the unexpected sunshine and headed to the coast in Brighton, where temperatures were expected to be 19C

Farm buildings, pubs and even a church and its graveyard were dismantled stone-by-stone. Meanwhile, coffins were removed from the graveyard and buried elsewhere.

The stones from construction sites were re-used to build the water tower, now situated along the Western shore of the reservoir.

But nearly 80 years on, water levels at the Haweswater reservoir are starting to drop significantly due to the lack of rain during the recent dry summer months.

The remains of the ancient structures, including farm gates and tree stumps, have now been revealed beside the receding waterline.

'It has been the driest start to September since 1960,' said a spokesperson for the Met Office.
