The distraught police chief of Newtown has spoken about the absolute 'carnage' he witnessed as one of the first responders inside Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Police Chief Michael Kehoe said that he was lost for words as he made his way round the building and said that the tragic shooting at the school was 'devastating, absolutely devastating.'

Describing the harrowing scene when he entered one classroom in the Connecticut school where shooter Adam Lanza had killed 14 1st graders and their teacher, Kehoe said it was obvious that no one had survived.

Police Chief Michael Kehoe said that he was lost for words and distraught upon entering Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in the immediate aftermath of the shooting massacre

'It was a very tragic observation on all parts, because then you could see the carnage that was present,' said Kehoe to CBS News about the massacre in which 20 children and six staff members lost their lives at the hands of 20-year-old Lanza.

'It was devastating, absolutely devastating. I had no words, I felt a little bit of anger towards the person who had done this.

Revealing that officers from Newtown police had to force their way in through the back of the school, Kehoe said that the school was erie and quiet as police stalked through the corridors with their guns drawn.

'We needed to break into the school to get in because the back doors are secured. We broke out the window,' said Kehoe.

'If the room was locked that means that the teachers had done their job, locked their doors and hid their children from danger.'

Kehoe told CBS News that by the time he had arrived Lanza was immobilised, but explained that his main emotion was regret that he couldn't have been there to stop the killing.

'Well you feel a sense of guilt that you weren't there quick enough to do that but i also know that our response stopped the threat where he was and he could not proceed any further,' said Kehoe.

Also present during the harrowing interview was Newtown Police Captain Joe Rios who was stationed outside the school as Chief Kehoe entered.

'It was miraculous, I kept seeing children coming out of the building and I kept wanting more to come out and more,' said Rios.

'I walked in and it was horrific, the crime scene itself and to see the adults and the children that were deceased in the classrooms - it was very hard obviously to comprehend what had happened.'

Adding to the tragedy, Chief Kehoe admitted that the year before he had visited the school to read a story to a class of Kindergarten students, some of whom would most likely have perished in the mass shooting.

'I may have read to some of these students that may have perished or not and that kind of hit me hard,' said Kehoe.

'I feel some sense of guilt - you know deep down inside I feel that our job was to keep kids safe and it is meant to be a learning environment.'

The interview follows yesterdays moment of silence for the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Connecticut
Governor Dannel Malloy had called for the state's residents to observe 
the moment at 9:30am to mark a week since 20-year-old Adam Lanza killed 
his mother and then stormed the Newtown school, where he shot to death 
20 children and six adults before killing himself.

Malloy's
fellow governors in Maine, Illinois, Michigan and several other states 
called on residents to follow suit with a moment of silence and rang 
bells to remember the dead.

The National Cathedral in Washington rang its bell 28 times as part of an interfaith memorial.

'We
have the moral obligation to stand for and with the victims of gun 
violence and to work to end it,' said Reverend Gary Hall, dean of 
Washington National Cathedral.

He called on Americans to pray 'that 
we may have courage to act, so that the murderous violence done on 
Friday may never be repeated.'

The
company that operates the Nasdaq stock exchange halted operations to 
observe a moment of silence at 9:30am, although the market opened 
trading at that time as usual.

The observances came just before a powerful U.S. gun rights lobbying group plunges into the national debate over gun control.

On the morning of Friday 14th December, Adam Lanza, 20, got into his car and left the house he shared with his mother, Nancy Lanza, who's lifeless body was now hidden within after Adam had shot her dead.

He traveled to the small school in rural New England and armed with an assault rifle began his attack on the Sandy Hook Elementary School - killing 20 children and six staff members.

And today the heartbroken families of Emilie Parker, Ana Marquez-Greene and Josephine Gay laid to rest their little angels today as the last of the funerals were held for the 26 Sandy Hook shooting victims.
