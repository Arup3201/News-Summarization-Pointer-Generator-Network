The family of a teenager who went missing from her home four days ago have made an emotional appeal for her to get in touch with them.

Alice Gross, 14, was last seen by her mother at 1pm on Thursday when she left her home in Hanwell, Ealing, west London. 

Alice, a pupil at Brentside High School, told her mother, Rosalind Hodgkiss, she would be home by 6pm but has not been seen since.

Police and her family are increasingly concerned for the teenager as she has a health condition that needs treatment.

Ms Hodgkiss said: 'What I would want to say is whatever she feels, or might have happened, we are not angry with her. We love her, we desperately miss her, we want to support her whatever is going on in her thoughts.

'We don't want to speculate about what might have caused her to go, if that indeed is what has happened. We want her to know how much we love her and miss her. 

'There is a huge hole in everybody's life and we can't believe that she is not here.'

Alice is white, 5ft 2in and slim, with shoulder-length, light brown hair. 

Appeal: Her family have issued an emotional appeal saying 'we want her to know how much we miss her'

Police are concerned for her whereabouts as she has a health condition. They are searching nearby parks

She was last seen wearing dark blue jeans, a dark green lacy cardigan and blue denim Vans shoes.

She may have had tartan-framed spectacles with her.

Sergeant Chris Naughton, from the Metropolitan Police, said officers had spoken with her friends, carried out house-to-house inquiries and searched parks and open spaces in their efforts to trace her.

He said: 'There is always a chance that she could have other friends that we don't know about and that is where parts of our lines of inquiry are going.

'Alice is a 14-year-old girl and like any teenager she goes online, and could have met people online.

Searching: They fear she may have met people online or could be with friends she met on a songwriting course

'Alice was up in Camden in mid-August doing a song-writing course at the Roundhouse and she may well have met some new friends up there that we don't know about, and that may be something we need to explore as a line of inquiry.'

He added: 'She has not been missing before and that is always concerning for both the family and ourselves investigating the disappearance. 

'It is important that Alice does come home so we can treat a health condition that she has.'
