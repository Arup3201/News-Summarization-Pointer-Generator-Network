We all make mistakes as teenagers that we would like to forget, but health and safely officer Roger has to live with his written all over his chest.

Roger, now 31, from North Yorkshire, had a bulldog tattooed on his chest when he was just 15.

Years later he lived to regret the decision but an attempt to have it removed made his situation even worse.

From bad to worse: When Roger tried to have to tattoo removed, he ended up with unsightly blisters when the treatment went wrong

When he was 26, he was injected with a chemical solution that was supposed to push the tattoo ink out of his skin, ridding him of his youthful mistake.

However, his body reacted badly to the treatment and he was instead left, not only with the tattoo still visible, but with unsightly bumps and scars on top of it.

Not only that, the treatment was incredibly painful and he needed to apply cream every day to sooth the damaged skin.

Mistake: Roger got the tattoo on his chest when he was 15

It also dented his self-esteem and made him too embarrassed to show his chest.

'It's all one big ball of embarrassment and a self-esteem killer,' he admitted.

Roger enlisted the help of the TLC TV show Last Chance Salon to see if they could help him.

Skin expert Dr Sam Bunting was horrified by the condition of Roger's skin.

She said: 'To be left with such a mess after one treatment is quite shocking.'

Shocking: Last Chance Salon expert Dr Bunting was surprised by the state of Roger's skin

No pain, no gain: She recommended Roger to have laser therapy treatment to remove the tattoo

Dealing with the problem with a skin graft was ruled out because this would lead to further scarring so Dr Bunting instead recommended Roger have a series of laser treatments.

However, she warned him this was not a simple solution as laser therapy can be extremely painful creating a hot, stinging sensation on the skin.

Roger would need thousands of laser shots into the area over a number of treatments to remove the tattoo. He would then need steroid injections to reduce the scarring.

On the mend: Roger's tattoo is now fainter, right, after laser therapy but he will still need steroid injections to rid him of the blisters

Gaining in confidence: He's delighted with his progress and can't wait till the tattoo is a distant memory

Returning to the Last Chance Salon after the first phase of laser treatment, the colours of the tattoo were already fading and Roger's self-confidence returning.

Dr Bunting said: 'He's a great example of how getting on the path of recovery can lead to an internal transformation.'

While Roger will still need further laser treatments and the steroid injections before his skin problem is completely resolved, he said he's delighted with the progress so far.

'The problem that was hovering over me I can really see it disappearing now,' he said.
