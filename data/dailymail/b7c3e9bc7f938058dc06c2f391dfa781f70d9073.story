It's not every day hundreds of tourists gather to worship at the spot of a severed tree branch.

But in the tiny village of Pocboc, Mexico, believers are coming from far and wide to pray next to a tree they believe contains an image of the Virgin Mary.

While it may not look so obvious to those without a large imagination (and a strong will to believe) religious villagers and tourists who are flocking to the site are so convinced of the likeness they insist it is a modern-day miracle.

Dozens of candles and flowers are being put daily in place at the foot of the tree as an offering to the image that they consider a miracle, despite skeptics saying it is nothing more than a pattern created by the tree rings. 

Pocboc is in the municipality of Hecelchakan in the south-eastern Mexican state of Campeche, where Prince Charles and Camilla recently visited.

Residents of the village say that the silhouette of the Virgin suddenly appeared in the trunk of the Melina tree (Gmelina arborea) and now locals are being joined by Catholic faithful from far and wide.

A 75-year-old villager, Dona Lidia, discovered the image while on an afternoon stroll to her work as a cleaner at the local high school.

'I have been working here for 18 years and always take this route and I can assure you that the image was not there before,' she said.

'I instantly had to tell my neighbours and when they came the word quickly spread.'

She said that soon people were arriving from far and wide to view the discovery of the 'Virgencita' (Little Virgin).

Another villager, Lidia del Socorro Moo, 55, said, 'Many hundreds of people have come to meet her, they bought her flowers and candles. All the villagers that believe have come here to visit.'

The director of the school where the cleaner was heading is Jose Francisco Farfan, 59, who said: 'Nothing like this has ever happened around here before, it must be a miracle.'

Maria del Rosario, 34, is one of many who ignore the sceptics.

'For me it is a miracle. I believe that God sent it to give us his blessing, so there will be an end to suffering,' she said.

The residents have planned a festival around the tree tomorrow (December 12). They are also going to ask the regional bishop if the image in the piece of wood could be considered as an official miracle.

The last time the Virgin Mary was 'seen' in a tree was in 2009 when a tree stump in Rathkeale, Co. Limerick, which workmen said bore her likeness was visited by believers with candles and prayers.

Sceptics said at the time that the believers were barking up the wrong tree.
