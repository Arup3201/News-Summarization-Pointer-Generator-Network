The number of companies going bust fell to its lowest level for seven years, it was revealed yesterday.

Some 548 firms fell into administration in England and Wales between July  and September, said the Insolvency Service.

That was nearly 20 per cent fewer than the same period last year and the lowest number since the first three months of 2005.

Despite the positive figures, economists warned that  recovery from recession will be long and slow as the crisis in the eurozone and slowdown  in the global economy take their toll.

A separate survey warned that Britain’s builders face ‘a long, dark winter’ despite an upturn in fortunes in October.

Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, said the UK faces ‘powerful economic headwinds’.

But experts welcomed the fall in businesses going bust, which coincided with the end of the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War. The economy grew by 1 per cent between July and September following nine months of decline.

Cash-strapped companies have been helped by record low interest rates and leeway from lenders, although that has not saved black cab maker Manganese Bronze or electrical goods chain Comet.

Corporate undertaker Mike Jervis, a partner at accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘We expect these lower levels of insolvencies to continue into the  New Year.

‘However, what happens after that depends crucially on the confidence of the consumer and the approach taken by the so-called zombie companies to rectify their balance sheets.’

A ‘zombie’ company is one which can pay the interest on its debts but not repay the debt itself, leaving it particularly vulnerable to a rise in  borrowing costs or a loss of business.

Lee Manning, of R3, the trade body for insolvency experts, said it estimated there are 146,000 zombie businesses.

He added: ‘Some of these have been running on empty for quite some time now, and with no reserves left in the tank, they may not be able to carry on for much longer.’ 

Personal insolvencies in England and Wales increased for the first time in a year  as more people struggled with unmanageable levels of debt.

There were 28,062 personal insolvencies in the third quarter of the year, up 2 per cent on the previous three months but still 7.2 per cent lower than the same period last year.

This figure could rise, said Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust charity. ‘Many households are running a budget deficit of their very own, and some are relying on credit to bridge the gap,’ she added.
