Transport for London (TfL) has been forced to apologise for an ‘extremely unhelpful’ tweet sent from its official Twitter account which told a disgruntled passenger to ‘leave early’ after he complained about being late.

The TfL Overground said it is ‘looking into the circumstances’ surrounding the message which was sent to frustrated customer @dan_down.

The Twitter spat started when @dan_down posted a message saying: ‘Sort it out @LDNOverground. If I’m late once more this month I lose 25 per cent of my salary. Are you lot reimbursing me?’

The Twitter spat started when @dan_down posted a message saying: 'Sort it out @LDNOvergournd. If I'm late once more this month I lose 25 per cent of my salary. Are you lot reimbursing me?'

However, it escalated when TfL responded to him with: ‘Leave early you will not be late next time. Hope this helps.’

The message sparked outrage from other customers on Twitter who branded it ‘arrogant’, ‘cheeky’ and ‘insincere’.

It prompted TfL to apologise for the brash message with the @LDNOverground account posting: ‘Apologies for the response you received earlier. I don't think it was meant to come across like that. I'll get this looked into.’

Vernon Everitt, TfL’s managing director for customer experience, marketing and communications, said: ‘We apologise to Dan for sending him this extremely unhelpful message.

‘Dan is absolutely right to complain and we are looking into the circumstances of how it came about.’

However, @dan_down said he wasn’t ‘accepting apologies’ and took to his Twitter page to inform his 450 followers he had emailed customers services ‘in the hope it’s taken seriously’.

He posted a stream of tweets berating the train company for its ‘insincere’ approach and ‘smart a**e answers’.

Despite an apology from TfL Overground, @dan_down said he wasn't 'accepting apologies' and took to his Twitter page to inform his 450 followers he had emailed customers services 'in the hope it's taken seriously'

In a series of tweets, he wrote: ‘Please
 enlighten me. Why should I have to compensate for your shoddy service? 
Why not run on time? @LDNOverground.

‘I arrive at the station expecting the trains to be on time. How dare you answer like that.

‘This can't be brushed aside with an insincere 'sorry'.

‘Stick to your timetable, and don't give smart a**e answers.’

Other users also jumped on the bandwagon and accused TfL Overground of being ‘arrogant’.

And @carolinehonour said: ‘How much time exactly should we be expected to leave early by? 3 hours? 5? Really quite surprised by your glibness.’

However, a few users seemed to find TfL’s tweet funny.

Neil Corry - ‏@LondonConcrete – wrote: ‘Whoever wrote this needs promoting not punishing.’

And
 @theaardvark said: ‘Don't see that you [TfL] should apologise for that 
at all. Seems eminently sensible to me. It's what I do.’

The message sparked outrage from other Transport for London customers who were shocked at its blunt tone

A recent customer charter performance report for Transport for London’s Overground service revealed all lines except one met the 95 per cent target set by the company.

The Public Performance Measure for 8 December 2013 to 4 January 2014 shows all services, except on the Richmond to Stratford line, exceeded the target of 95.2 per cent for timetabled trains that arrived at their destination within five minutes of their scheduled arrival time, having completed their full journey and having called at all booked station stops.

The average performance of the Richmond to Stratford line last year was rated at 93.85 per cent - just under the target.
