A U.S. gunmaker has cut ties with Taken star Liam Neeson and has urged other manufacturers to do the same after the actor said there were too many guns in America.

PARA USA said that they regret the decision to provide firearms for use in Neeson's latest film Taken 3 and add they will no longer be associating their brand with the actor while urging other companies to follow their lead.

The gunmaker is cutting ties with the actor after the Irish-born 62-year-old, who is the star of the ultra-violent Taken trilogy, waded into America's gun fraught gun debate last week during a press conference in Dubai for the launch of Taken 3.

Liam Neeson starring in the latest instalment of the Taken trilogy. where he plays a gun-toting father. A U.S. gunmaker has now cut ties with the actor after he said there were too many guns in America 

Mr Neeson waded into America's gun fraught gun debate last week during a press conference in Dubai for the launch of Taken 3

He told reporters that 'there are just too many f****** guns out there' and added that it was a 'f****** disgrace.'

In a statement on their Facebook page, PARA USA confirmed they would be no longer working with Mr Neeson.

They said: 'PARA USA regrets its decision to provide firearms for use in the film Taken 3.

'While the film itself is entertaining, comments made by its Irish-born star during press junkets reflect a cultural and factual ignorance that undermines support of the Second Amendment and American liberties.

'We will no longer provide firearms for use in films starring Liam Neeson and ask that our friends and partners in Hollywood refrain from associating our brand and products with his projects.

'Further, we encourage our partners and friends in the firearms industry to do the same.'

Action hero: Liam Neeson starred in a 2010 remake of the 1980s classic Saturday serial The A Team - where he played the commander of a framed special forces ops team

Neeson was quick to draw a line between guns in movies, and real life saying 'it's fantasy' and says movies like Taken 3 don't inspire people to buy guns

Taken again: In the sequel to Taken, called Taken 2, Liam Neeson used his particular set of skills to rescue his wife and shoot a lot of bad guys again

Their statement comes after Mr Neeson, who is reported to have been paid $20million for the latest instalment of Taken, spoke out last week about guns in the wake of the Paris terror attacks.

Her said: 'There's just too many f****** guns out there. Especially in America. I think the population is like, 320 million? There's over 300 million guns. Privately owned, in America.

'I think it's a f****** disgrace. Every week now we're picking up a newspaper and seeing, yet another few kids have been killed in schools.'

When asked if the issue extends to police responsibility Mr Neeson said 'let's not get into it'.

But then added: 'Let's put it this way: I think a light has been shone on the justice system in America, and it's a justifiable light.'

Mr Neeson, a supporter of gun control, is best known as gun-toting father, Bryan Mills, who will stop at nothing to get his loved ones back.

But he was quick to make the distinction between fiction and reality, and said his movies wouldn't inspire people to buy and use guns and argued that growing up watching cowboy movies had not turned him into a killer.

Runaway success: Liam Neeson has starred in three Taken movies since the release of the first film in the franchise in 2008 and each of the posters for the movies showed the actor sporting a gun

Biggest hit to date in the series: The latest Taken movie has grossed almost $40 million in its opening weekend and deposed the last Hobbit movie from the number 1 spot in the US box office

He explained: 'A character like Bryan Mills going out with guns and taking revenge: it's fantasy. It's in the movies, you know? I think it can give people a great release from stresses in life and all the rest of it, you know what I mean? It doesn't mean they're all going to go out and go, 'Yeah, let's get a gun!'

The Irish-born actor became an American citizen five years ago and currently lives in New York City.

Before speaking out about gun ownership in America, Neeson reflected on Said and Cherif Kouachi's shooting spree earlier this month that claimed a dozen lives.

He said: 'First off, my thoughts and prayers and my heart are with the deceased, and certainly with all of France. I've got a lot of dear friends in Paris.'

The wildly successful Taken trilogy has grossed almost $603 million to date in box office worldwide.

It has turned Mr Neeson from a respected character actor most famous for his portrayal of Oscar Schindler in Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning Schindler's List into a fully fledged action hero.

The star is reported to have been paid $20 million for his role as CIA operative Bryan Mills, joining the ranks of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks as Hollywood's best paid stars.

Since 2005, Liam Neeson has launched a lucrative second career as an action hero.

Change of career: No more historical dramas for 60 something action hero Liam Neeson

In a little under a decade, the Irish-born actor has starred in 10 action films, having previously starred in character-driven roles.

But from the box-office takings, it is clear that Neeson's career switch has paid-off, and handsomely.

Twleve of Neeson's 15 highest-grossing movies in the United States are action films and of those dozen, only three were released before 2005.

Indeed, studio bosses have been keen to utilize the actors bankability through his new-found action hero status.

In the United States, the average profit per Neeson action movie is $181 million, while his non-action offerings rake in $4 million.

That puts him up with stars such as Tom Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio, who make anywhere between $100 million and $300 million per film.

And of course, this new found stardom has boosted Neeson's net worth.

He was reportedly paid $1 million for Taken, $15 million for Taken 2 and $20 million for Taken 3 - seeing his bank balance shoot up to $75 million.
