A couple have been found dead in their remote cottage in a suspected suicide pact, it has emerged.

The pair, named locally as Brian Hainsworth, 64, and wife Sharon, 57, were discovered by paramedics at around 8.30am today.

Police are not treating their deaths as suspicious, but mystery surrounds events at the secluded stone property. The fire brigade were called, although it is not clear why.

Mystery: Detectives and forensic teams investigate the suspected double suicide of Brian and Sharon Hainsworth at their secluded cottage in Calverley, West Yorkshire

A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out to determine the cause of deaths.

Forensic teams have been on scene for much of the day at the property, which is owned by the nearby Woodhall Hills Golf Club in Calverley, West Yorkshire.

Mark Romans, manager of the golf club, said Mr and Mrs Hainsworth rented one of three terrace properties.

He said: 'They have lived in the cottage for about five years. They weren't members of the club so didn't come in, but I knew Sharon through various dealings with the property.

'I would speak to her every few months about maintenance of the property and that sort of thing.'

He said he last saw Sharon a few months ago when he was arranging to check something at the house.

Questions remain: The couple were discovered by paramedics at around 8.30am. A post-mortem is due to be carried out to determine the cause of deaths

He added: 'I don’t know what happened, no-one at the club saw anything. It's quite a secluded area, just the three cottages down a lane.

'I didn’t have much to do with Brian, but Sharon seemed like a normal, nice lady. Nothing unusual, she was just an everyday person.

'They didn't seem to have any problems, there was never any issue of them not paying their rent or anything.

'The police have been round to tell us there were two bodies found at around 8.30am. They couldn’t really tell us anything as they were still investigating.'

A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said the deaths were not being treated as suspicious.

He added: 'Inquiries into the full circumstances are continuing but police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.'

He said the couple would not be formally named until the next of kin had been informed and the post-mortem carried out.
