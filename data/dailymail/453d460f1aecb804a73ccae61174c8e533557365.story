Mike Dixon, 46, from Reading, suffered a massive stroke soon after boarding a nine-hour night flight from the US and was unable to move or tell anyone

A man who had a massive stroke on a plane has told how it left him stuck in his seat for nine hours, unable to alert anyone to what had happened.

Mike Dixon, 46, from Reading, was only given help and first aid after the plane landed and cabin crew spotted him still in his seat after everyone else had got off.

The Microsoft employee, who couldn't speak or move as a result of the stroke, was then rushed by ambulance to hospital, where he spent 16 days before being allowed home.

Mr Dixon, whose wife Moira and son were at home in Berkshire, was flying home alone to London from a business conference in Las Vegas when he was taken ill.

Before boarding the Virgin Atlantic flight, he suffered a mini-stroke at his hotel, but did not realise this and boarded the plane home assuming he was just unwell.

The father of one said: 'I didn't realise it was a stroke, I thought I'd slept funnily.  I assumed I could sleep it off and I'd be fine in the morning.'

He said that after the mini-stroke, also known as a TIA (transient ischaemic attack), he felt as though he was drunk.

'I was unstable and banging into things,' he said.  'I don't know how I got through security at the airport - I think they thought I was drunk.'

He then boarded the night flight and settled into his middle seat in a bank of three.

'The middle seat, when you're 6ft 4in, is bad enough, and I just lost all feeling.'

Once there, he suffered a second, massive, stroke, which left him unable to tell anyone or even move for the entire flight.

He said: 'I'm not sure exactly when it happened but it was pretty soon after I sat down.  My arm was twitching, so I sat on it, and then it just went numb.'

With the lights dimmed, Mr Dixon went unnoticed, even after the plane landed at Gatwick and passengers disembarked.  The man sitting next to Mr Dixon climbed over him to get out.

He said: 'He asked me to move and obviously I couldn't, so he just climbed over.  Everything after that is a blur.'

Cabin crew spotted Mr Dixon still in his seat in the otherwise empty plane, and came to his aid.

He said: 'I think I knew then I would be looked after - the ambulance came onto the forecourt to get me off the plane.

Mr Dixon said no-one suspected he had had a stroke because no-one expects someone in their 40s to have one

'At the hospital my wife was told I'd suffered a stroke.'

He added: 'I couldn't say many words, but there was a Scottish lady on my ward and I kept shouting 'Freedom' at her from the film Braveheart.

'I could sing, too - the nurse would sing Old Macdonald and I would make the pig noises.'

After being allowed home, it took several months for Mr Dixon to be able to use his right hand, and six months for him to be able to hold a proper conversation.

He said: 'My movement came back relatively quickly, but from my fingers to my elbow is still a bit sketchy.

'When I was in hospital I was given a coffee and because I couldn’t control my hand I squashed the cup. It just wasn’t working properly.

'It’s getting better every day and I look like a normal person apart from my right hand.

'The stroke has ruined me with numbers. I can’t do anything consecutively. I can’t do seasons or months - things that should be easy to do.'

Eighteen months on from the stroke, Mr Dixon, who praised Virgin staff for reacting quickly once they realised what had happened, and even calling him days later to check how he was, said he's not surprised he went unnoticed during the night flight.

He said: 'Nobody looks at you and thinks it’s going to be a stroke. If I was 10 or 20 years older then they might have thought about a stroke, but not at my age.'

Strokes can be revealed with an MRI of the brain (file image, above) but there are other, more obvious, symptoms

Mike Dixon suffered, as many stroke patients do, a TIA, or early-warning mini-stroke before having a second, massive stroke.

The Stroke Association says that one in 10 people who suffer a TIA go on to have a full-blown stroke within a week if they remain untreated.

A TIA is a sign that part of the brain isn't getting enough blood. Each year more than 46,000 people have their first TIA.

Doctors say people should remember the FAST test to help them diagnose if they or someone else has had a stroke or mini-stroke.

F is for face - has the face fallen on one side?  Can they smile?

A is for arms - can they raise both arms and keep them there?

S is for speech - is their speech slurred?

T is for time - it is time to call an ambulance if one of the above applies.

Peggy Johns, a Stroke Association coordinator who supported Mr Dixon, said: 'Mike’s story highlights the fact that when someone has a stroke, often they cannot communicate.

'That’s why it’s so important to be aware of the symptoms of stroke, use the FAST test, and seek urgent medical 
attention if you suspect a stroke.

'Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the UK and the emotional effects can be just as devastating as the physical.

'A stroke can happen out of the blue 
and be very frightening. But with the right help and support many people
 can build a life after stroke.'
