In Amsterdam's world-famous red light district, four attractive, half-dressed young women stand behind a window as visitors walk by.

In an all-too familiar scene, they flirt, pout and pose for the tourists, men seeking sex in exchange for cash and curious sightseers on the street outside.

'De Wallen' is the largest red-light district in the city and consists of a network of alleys containing hundreds of tiny one-room cabins rented by prostitutes to ply their trade.

Depressingly common: A typical scene in Amsterdam's red light district, but something unexpected looms

Routine: The 'prostitutes' begin a choreographed dance, drawing a crowd

Suddenly, one of the women begins to shake violently, causing those wandering by to stop and watch, unsure as to what is happening.

One by one the women join in with her curious actions, before amazing the crowd by launching into a storming, intricately choreographed dance routine.

The crowd is delighted, cheering their approval and applauding. Some even begin to dance along with them while on the floor above, two more dancers join in the show.

Amazingly, the dance is in sync, even though the women are in separate cubicles

At the finale, the crowd whoops and claps at the incredible scene that has just unfolded before them as the women stand triumphant.

But the watchers' grins suddenly sour as a projector displays a stark message in black and white across the front of the building.

'Every year, thousands of women are promised a dance career in Western Europe.

'Sadly, they end up here.'

Finale: The high-energy routine comes to a dramatic end

Adulation: The crowd launches into applause and wolf whistles as the routine ends

Denouement: A projector displays the awful truth

Abuse: Women throughout the world are tricked into sexual slavery with false promises of work

The crowd is left shocked and uncomfortably, starkly aware of the human misery that fuels the sex trade.

The statistics are raw: In the Netherlands, 33 per cent of the prostitutes come from countries outside of the European Union. This increases to half in the larger cities, according to the European Conference on Trafficking in Women.

Sobering: Realisation dawns as the true message becomes clear

Grim reminder: Trafficking for the sex trade is rife in Western Europe

And since 1990 in the Netherlands, the number of trafficked women from Central and Eastern European Countries has tripled.

The hard-hitting stunt was created by Dutch advertising firm Duval Guillaume for anti trafficking group, Stop the Traffik.

The group campaigns and acts to stop people being deceived or taken against their will and sold and transported into slavery for sexual exploitation, forced begging, the removal of human organs, sold as child brides or forced to work in sweat shops and domestic servitude.

The stunt was done by Stop The Traffik, a campaign group that fights modern slavery
