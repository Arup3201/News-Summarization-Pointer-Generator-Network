Sales of ukuleles are soaring as the quirky four-stringed instrument enjoys a dramatic resurgence.

The instrument, originally from Hawaii, was championed in Britain by the comedian George Formby.

His comic music hall songs like When I’m Cleaning Windows and Leaning on a Lamppost became smash hits of the Thirties and Forties.

Lately, however, it has enjoyed a resurgence thanks to new musicians – including London folk band Mumford and Sons – bringing it to the attention of younger audiences. 

Now, The Music Industries Association (MIA) in the UK said combined online and high street sales have doubled in Britain to about 250,000 a year over the past five years.

The rise in sales has been helped by the fact it is relatively cheap, with John Lewis selling the instruments for about £25.

Paul McManus, chief executive of the MIA, told The Times: ‘We’re seeing a global effect. 

'There is the Mumford effect, but also schools are using it as an alternative to recorders as an easy, cost-effective instrument to start learning.’

Hundreds of ukulele clubs have sprung up across Britain over the past few years.

The ukulele has also seen a dramatic rise in interest across the Atlantic. 

In America, the National Association of Music Merchants reported a 54 per cent jump in ukulele sales in 2013.
