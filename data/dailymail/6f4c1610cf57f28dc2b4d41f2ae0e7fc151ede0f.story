Running the line: Alberto Moreno is close to sealing a £16m switch to Liverpool from Sevilla

So tell me a little about Alberto Moreno...

He is a 22-year-old left back that plays for Sevilla, after emerging through the club’s youth system.

He has played three times for Spain and is rated as one of the most talented players in his position in Europe. Moreno made 40 appearances last season and was part of the Sevilla side that won the Europa League.  

Have Liverpool been watching him for long?

Yes, they have had their eye on Moreno for some time now. A deal looked close at the beginning of the summer but Liverpool baulked at Sevilla’s £20m asking price, valuing the player in the region of £14m.

So why have they gone back in for Moreno?

Ryan Bertrand emerged as the prime target but Chelsea were reluctant to do business with a potential title rival and the player also wanted to be guaranteed first-team football, as he will be on loan at Southampton this season.

Can we expect the deal to be wrapped up soon?

Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre is understood to be travelling to Spain this weekend to seal the deal. A compromise of around £16m is thought to have been reached between Liverpool and Sevilla.

Why have Liverpool been so keen to draft in a left back?

It has emerged as a problem position for Reds boss Brendan Rodgers. Jose Enrique suffered a long-term injury last season but some had already questioned his credentials as an elite-level full back.

Aly Cissokho’s loan spell was erratic and he has returned to Valencia. Jon Flanagan, 21, will provide stiff competition for Moreno though.
