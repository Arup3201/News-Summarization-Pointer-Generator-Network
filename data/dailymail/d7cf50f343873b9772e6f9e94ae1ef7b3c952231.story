After Lady Mary’s husband died, Downton Abbey fans naturally focused on the young widow and the bachelors vying to woo her.

But the growing bond between Carson and Mrs Hughes has offered hopes of a more mature romance, too – and the actors who play the two servants couldn’t be more delighted.

Yesterday, Jim Carter and Phyllis Logan said the interest in their friendship proves viewers want to see characters falling in love later in life.

Miss Logan, 57, who plays housekeeper Mrs Hughes, said there should be more such storylines on television.

‘As a person of a certain age – regardless of whether you’re a man or a woman – it would be nice to think that we’re not just confined to being “old”, but that we still have options to play a variety of emotions and parts,’ she said.

And it seems viewers agree, as romantic plotlines between older characters are proving popular.

The BBC scored a huge hit with Last Tango in Halifax, its recent drama about a romance between two widowed 70-somethings.

Last month Anne Reid, 78, who plays Celia in the show, was honoured with an Older People in the Media Award for her role.

Carter, 65, who plays the butler in Downton, said he was a big fan of Last Tango in Halifax: ‘It’s brilliant – I absolutely love it.’

For Carson and Mrs Hughes, who are in charge of the Downton servants, friendship has blossomed over after-hours chats.

And their endearing closeness has already seen them christened as the downstairs version of Lord and Lady Crawley.

Carter, 65, said: ‘I think people are very affectionate towards Mr Carson and Mrs Hughes.

‘And because we have our lovely scenes where we meet up at the end of the day and share a sherry, and we’re the only people downstairs of equal status so we can share confidences, I think people are busily reading romance into that – and the whole thing’s about love stories, isn’t it?’

Meanwhile Miss Logan said she is  glad the cliche of young females being seduced by older males has started to die out.

‘I think people now realise how ridiculous that is,’ she said in an interview with Radio Times, adding that she was pleased when BBC1 drama Cranford gave older characters interesting love lives.

‘[Cranford] had Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, Imelda Staunton,  Barbara Flynn, Deborah Findlay, Julia McKenzie.

‘They were up there in the front, and love’s young dream was pushed into the corner. That was successful and people enjoyed that.’

Last Christmas, Downton’s writers left fans distraught after one of the show’s best-loved romances, between Lady Mary and her husband Matthew Crawley, was cut short. He died in a car crash just after the birth of their first child.
