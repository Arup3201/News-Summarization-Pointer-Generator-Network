One Direction's Harry Styles scores as highly for angry as he does upbeat according to analysis of his tweets

While X Factor judge Simon Cowell may be known for his caustic comments to contestants on the talent show, his tweets reveal he is predominantly upbeat, analytical and personable. 

One Direction's Harry Styles on the other hand, known for his cheeky persona, appears to be angry.

Analyze Words, a website developed by researchers, uses the posts of Twitter users to reveal the main emotions they are portraying. 

The tool analyses the most recent tweets to rate them for emotional, social and personal style and gives scores for 11 traits including how worried or angry celebrities are, as well as how upbeat and 'plugged in' they appear. Each person is then given a score from very low to very high for each of the categories.

Some of the findings are quite surprising and challenge the public image of well-known figures.  

The most pronounced trait for Stephen Fry is one of arrogance or distant, with the comedian and presenter scoring very high for this category compared to a low score for personable.
