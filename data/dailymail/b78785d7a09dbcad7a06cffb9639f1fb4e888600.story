Threats: James O'Neill viciously beat his partner with a beer bottle before fleeing on a bus clad only in his boxer shorts

A man threatened to kill his partner while savagely beating her with a beer bottle, before fleeing on a bus clad only in a pair of boxer shorts.

James O'Neill, 46, attacked Hazell Peters 'completely out of the blue' with a Buddha-shaped bottle as she was lying on their bed watching Emmerdale.

O'Neill - who chanted the words 'I'm going to kill you' as he repeatedly hit his partner of seven years in a frenzied attack lasting 15 minutes - only stopped when Ms Peters told him her grandson was due to arrive at any moment.

He was later arrested after being spotted half naked on a bus.

O'Neill was jailed for over 12 years at Preston Crown Court for the attack on his 51-year-old partner, which left her needing more than 60 stitches to her head, face and arm, along with a broken bone in her ear and a perforated ear drum.

Ms Peters, who told how she desperately pleaded with her partner to stop hitting her at their home in Morecambe, Lancashire, said: 'He's not a man, he's a monster.'

'It was completely out of the blue,' she said.

'I was lying on our bed watching Emmerdale, and he came into the room. He was very calm.

'Out of nowhere he said: "You're going to die".

'It was as if he was telling me he had made me a cup of tea.'

As
well as hitting Ms Peters with the Lucky Beer bottle, which she kept as an 
ornament on her bedroom windowsill, O'Neill tried to strangle his partner and threw a kettle and a fan at her.

'He kept hitting me and hitting me,' Ms Peters said of the ordeal on September 13 last year.

'He wanted me to die. I didn't think he was ever going to let me out.

'I was pleading with him to stop but he was determined to kill me. I don't
know why, he didn't seem angry, he just wanted to hurt me,' she said.

It was only when she told him that her grandson would soon be arriving at their home that O'Neill relented.

'It was the only way I could think to get him to leave me alone,' said Ms Peters.

'Denton would come to us every Friday afternoon after school. He wasn't coming that week, but James didn't know that. It worked. It was almost like someone had flicked a switch.'

Recovery: Ms Peters, who needed more than 60 stitches after the 15 minute attack, has welcomed her former partner's 12 year jail sentence

O'Neill jumped up from the bed and stripped down to his boxer shorts before ordering Ms Peters to take off her clothes. 'I did what he told me, because I had no idea what he was going to do next,' she said.'There was blood everywhere, it had splattered up the walls and my clothes were drenched. He said that we needed to clean up and he began wiping the walls with his t-shirt.'

Ms Peters managed to grab a jumper and run outside, where a passing motorist spotted the bleeding woman and called the emergency services.

When police arrived at the house O'Neill had fled, but he was picked up by officers after being spotted on a bus wearing just his boxer shorts.

An original charge of attempted murder was changed to a section 18 wounding offence at an earlier hearing at Preston Crown Court. O'Neill pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years and eight months in jail.

Ms Peters said she was 'really pleased' with the sentence. DC Ian Cartwright, of Lancashire Police's Public Protection Unit, said: 'This was a vicious attack that left the victim fearing for her life. 'She is still suffering after the incident and, while most of her physical injuries are healing, she has found her confidence greatly shaken.

'Victims of domestic violence should know that the police take this kind of crime very seriously and we will not only do all we can to bring an offender to justice but to provide help and support to the victim so that they can find the path away from their abusive situation.'
