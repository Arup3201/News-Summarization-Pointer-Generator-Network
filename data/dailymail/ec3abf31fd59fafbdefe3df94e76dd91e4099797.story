There is growing concern that the United States could become gripped by a measles epidemic, according to the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said his agency is 'very concerned' about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in the U.S. 

His fears come as a growing number of people who have not been vaccinated against the disease are being exposed to the rest of the population.

Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC said his agency is 'very concerned' about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in the U.S.

Frieden said in an interview on CBS' 'Face the Nation' Sunday: 'What we've seen is, as over the last few years, a small but growing number of people have not been vaccinated. 

'That number is building up among young adults in society, and that makes us vulnerable.

'We have to make sure that measles doesn't get a foothold in the U.S. It's been actually eliminated from this country for 15 years. 

'All of our cases result, ultimately, from individuals who have traveled and brought it back here.'

At last count, there were 102 reported cases of measles in 14 states across the country.

However, this looks set to grow.

The CDC has now launched an aggressive campaign to combat the spread of the disease which can be highly contagious.

The organization aims to identify and isolate people who may have the disease in order to stop it spreading further.

Frieden advised that the best way to halt the spread of the disease is by getting vaccinated and said that the vaccine is both safe and effective. 

At least 92 percent of the population is vaccinated. However, the number of children who are not vaccinated, is higher in some states, particularly in California where the most recent outbreak of the disease was linked to Disney theme parks.

Yet, this outbreak, according to NBC probably came from overseas, carried either by a foreign tourist or by an American coming back with the virus.

To date, the virus from Disneyland has infected 94 people in eight states, and 67 can be clearly linked to the theme park,  health officials report.

'We don't know exactly how this outbreak started but we do think it was likely a person infected with measles overseas,' Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Outbreak: The outbreak of measles that started in California's Disneyland has infected 94 people in eight states, and 67 can be clearly linked to Disneyland, California health officials report

'We assume that someone got infected with measles overseas, visited Disneyland park, and spread the disease to others.'

According to CBS News, in southern California, eight percent of kindergarteners fail to get the required immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella. 

Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, it's 15 percent of kindergarteners, because many parents simply do not want to 'risk' getting their child vaccinated.

Frieden told the TV show that some parents who opt out of vaccinations cited a 'personal belief,' but it never appeared to be for a particularly strong reason.

He also warned that parents are putting their child at risk if they do not vaccinate them, and this also puts others at risk too.

The CDC is keen to avoid a devastating outbreak similar to the one which took hold in 1989 and 1991, when 55,000 people got measles and 123 died.

Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but a few imported cases come in every year. 

But the CDC director does not want to see widespread mandatory vaccinations rolled out, like in   Mississippi and West Virginia, which have nearly 100 percent vaccination rates.
