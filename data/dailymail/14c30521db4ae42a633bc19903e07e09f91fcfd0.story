The late tech guru supposedly said: ¿That¿s it?¿ in 2004 when the company¿s shares decreased two per cent following revelations he had undergone surgery

Steve Jobs was disappointed that Apple's share price did not go down more when he announced he had cancer, a new book claims.

The late tech guru supposedly said: ‘That’s it?’ in 2004 when the company’s shares decreased two per cent following revelations he had undergone surgery,

Jobs apparently thought the reaction of the stock market was not enough to reflect his importance to Apple, author Yukari Kane claims.

Her book on Apple after Jobs, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2011, adds to the portrait of a man who was unafraid to be blunt and speak his mind.

Jobs’ authorised biography already described how he rebuked even President Obama, and once said Microsoft founder Bill Gates should take drugs and live in an ashram as he had done himself.

Kane’s book, called Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs, suggests that since Jobs’ death, Apple has floundered and its future is not secure.

In an extract, published in the New York Post, Kane wrote that he is ‘really skeptical’ about the chance of a new smart TV succeeding because it costs too much.

Consumers can buy a good TV for $600 so she is not convinced they would be willing to pay more than three times that for the Apple version.

Kane dismissed the much-rumoured iWatch as a fashion accessory, too: 'I mean, would you want one?'

'On the innovation front, I guess we’ll see. But I do think its going to be difficult.’

The problem Apple faces is that Jobs was a ‘disruptive innovator’ and new chief executive Tim Cook is a different kind of person, according to Kane.

She said Cook is the right man for the job as Apple in a ‘new stage of life’: 'Tim Cook has to reset expectations for Apple. Right now Apple is caught in this spot where they’re saying: "We haven’t changed. We’re as innovative as ever" - when everything has changed.'

Jobs’ official biography was written 
by author Walter Isaacson who interviewed the notoriously private tech 
guru 40 times and was granted unprecedented access to his friends and 
family.

The book 
detailed how Jobs had a showdown with Barack Obama over his refusal to 
extend him a personal invitation for a meeting. After five days he 
backed down and grudgingly accepted the offer from one of Mr Obama’s 
staff.

But when he 
eventually spoke to the U.S. President he had harsh words for him and 
said: ‘You’re headed for a one-term presidency’.

Jobs also erupted when Google launched its Android operating system, which is similar to iOS but has become more popular.

During
 one discussion about a patent lawsuit over the Android Isaacson wrote 
that Jobs said: ‘I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this’.

In the memoir Isaacson delved into 
why Jobs did not undergo what could have been life-saving surgery 
earlier for the cancer that went on to kill him.

Instead he relied on alternative therapies for nine months whilst his wife and close friends looked on in horror.

Isaacson
 said in an interview: ‘I’ve asked Jobs why he didn’t get an operation 
then and he said, ‘I didn’t want my body to be opened…I didn’t want to 
be violated in that way’.

‘I
 think that he kind of felt that if you ignore something, if you don’t 
want something to exist, you can have magical thinking…we talked about 
this a lot.

He continued: ‘Our lawsuit is saying, 'Google you f****** ripped off the iPhone, wholesale ripped us off.

‘I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong. I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product.’

'He wanted to talk about it, how he regretted it….I think he felt he should have been operated on sooner.'

In a statement Tim Cook, Apple’s new chief executive, said that Kane’s book was ‘nonsense (that) belongs with some of the other books I’ve read about Apple.

He said: 'It fails to capture Apple, Steve, or anyone else in the company. I am very confident about our future.'
