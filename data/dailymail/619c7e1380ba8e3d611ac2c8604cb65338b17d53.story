They're the quadruplets who made 
medical history when they were born prematurely a year ago and now 
Caroline, Darcy, Alexis and Elisha are celebrating their first 
birthday.

After nearly a
 decade of trying, Justin and Christine Clark had almost given up hope 
of becoming parents and had resigned themselves to being childless. It 
was their first round of IVF that proved successful - quite 
spectacularly. 

And that is
 not the only reason the quads are extraordinary. Incredibly, they are 
also the result of just one embryo after it split into three and then 
one of those embryos split into two.

How they've grown! The famous Clark quads (L-R) Caroline, Darcy, Elisha and Alexis are today celebrating their first birthday

The odds of one embryo creating four babies is likely to only happen once every 4,000 years, according to experts.

‘We’re
 the first people it’s happened to and even some doctors find it hard to
 believe,' Justin told the Daily Mail at the time of birth.

Today, the four girls are celebrating with a party at their home in Rotherham, South Yorks.

'It’s
 been an incredible first year,' 44-year-old Justin told The 
Express.'That first night home was just chaos, they were all crying at 
different times and all needed constant feeding. I’d love to say it’s 
got easier but it hasn’t.'

Proud parents: Justin and Caroline Clark brought their four three-month-old daughters home from a special care unit last month- and they've had their hands full ever since

Miracle babies: Caroline, Darcy, Alexis and Elisha were born at 30 weeks after their mother was hospitalised

Little miracles: After nearly a decade of trying, Justin and Christine Clark had almost given up hope of becoming parents but their first round of IVF  proved successful and here they are today

Justin and Christine met in a pub 12 
years ago and married three years later. Like most young, married 
couples, they longed to start a family.

‘I’d
 always wanted to be a mum,’ Christine said at the time of the girl's 
birth. ‘I don’t come from a big family, but children were always on the 
agenda. We started trying before we got married, but nothing happened.

‘I was only 25, so I didn’t panic. 
But after two years we went to our GP who did lots of tests. It turned 
out I had polycystic ovaries and would probably need help to get 
pregnant.

Supermarket sweep: Trips to the supermarket are more fun - and their local has custom-built a four-seater trolley for their weekly shop

Quite a handful: The babies were getting through 200 nappies and are all lactose intolerant

‘It was very 
upsetting. Friends were getting pregnant and while I was always happy 
for them and never jealous, I would be thinking: “Why isn’t it happening
 for us?”’

The couple tried several treatments, including the ovary-stimulating drug Clomid, but the side-effects made Christine ill.

‘IVF was really a last resort because we knew what a rollercoaster it could be,’ she says. 

‘People
 don’t understand unless they’ve done it, and we discussed whether we 
wanted to put ourselves through it. It was our final hope.’

Justin and Christine were referred to Care Fertility in Sheffield, and were offered two rounds of IVF on the NHS.

Celebrations: The foursome will be celebrating with presents at their home tomorrow

Each to their own: The quads are developing their own individual personalities as they grow older, say their parents

She finally fell pregnant and was admitted to hospital 
for bed rest at 24 weeks and the twins were delivered by Caesarean 
section at 30 weeks on March 25, weighing between 2lb and 3lb each.

‘We had more than 42 staff and took 
up two surgical theatres,’ she says. ‘Everyone wanted a front-row seat. 
When the babies came out, they were whisked into a side room and Justin 
went with them. 

‘It was upsetting for me as I was desperate to see them, but I didn’t get anywhere near them for 24 hours. That was hard. 

‘Justin
 took 253 pictures of them to show me because I went straight to high 
dependency. The babies had bruised my lungs because they’d been kicking 
me so hard.’

Inseparable: The quads' parents say the four girls do everything together

Troublemakers: 'They get up to all sorts of stuff together and always seem to encourage each other. It¿s brilliant to watch,' said their father

Christine left
 hospital a week later, but her daughters remained in special care for 
nine more weeks until they came home at the end of May.

A year later, the lorry driver and his nurse wife 
Christine, 37, say that the girls are all coming into their own and are 
gradually becoming self-sufficient.

'They
 are always together,' said Justin. 'They get up to all sorts of stuff 
together and always seem to encourage each other. It’s brilliant to 
watch.'

Unfortunately, all 
four of the girls are lactose intolerant and allergic to dairy, soya and
 glucose, which sets the family back £2,500-a-month.

Trips to the supermarket are, however, easier - their local has custom-built a four-seater trolley for their weekly shop.
