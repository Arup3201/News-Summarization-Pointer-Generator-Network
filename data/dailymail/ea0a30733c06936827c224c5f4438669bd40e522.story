The Duchess of Cambridge has fought off competition from Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham to be crowned the UK's most influential beauty icon.

Women are three times more likely to buy products favoured by the Duchess than by the Croydon supermodel, according to a survey.

The Duchess' fresh-faced make-up look and glossy locks proved most popular with 30 per cent of women surveyed, compared to 15 per cent who wanted products favoured by Moss, and 12 per cent who chose products picked by Beckham.

Other popular sources of inspiration included model-of-the-moment, Cara Delevingne, reality star Kim Kardashian and actress Jennifer Aniston.

Angelina Jolie came seventh, while New York socialite Olivia Palermo ranked eighth in the poll (four per cent).

Palermo was closely followed by fellow reality star Millie Mackintosh whose dewy skin is emulated by three per cent of British women.

Made in Chelsea’s Millie’s look proved to be more influential with UK buyers than that of Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow who brought up the rear in 10th place.

'Kate and Kate represent two sides of really modern women and between the two of them they cover all style and lifestyle tastes,' commented Newby Hands, editorial director at Feel Unique, the beauty e-tailer which conducted the research.

Polished: Kim Kardashian's glossy look proved popular

'Moss is more party and rock n' roll, while Kate Middleton is more of a perfect wife and role model.

'Despite their differences they are both aspirational and fascinating. What was interesting was it was very equal, almost head to head with Kate Middleton just tipping the balance on popularity.'

Popular products loved by the Duchess of Cambridge include Elizabeth Arden's Rose Illumination, £19.55, and Lancôme's Génifique Advanced Youth Activating Concentrate, £92.

'We have seen first-hand the "Kate Effect" on sales of beauty products," says Siobhan McDermott, feelunique.com's general manager.

'Two years ago blonde shades were more than twice as popular as brunette tones. Immediately after the Royal Wedding we experienced a surge in brown shades and in particular, Kate's signature Natural Dark Brown colour.

'It's now our most popular shade and contributes to brown colours consistently outselling blondes by two to one.'
