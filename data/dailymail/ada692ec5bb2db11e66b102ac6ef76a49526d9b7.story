With 440 arrests in four years, he could never be accused of softly-softly policing.

Not least because, as his admiring colleagues put it, he just loves ‘sinking his teeth into criminals’.

But all good things come to an end and now Janus, a Belgian Malinois police dog, is retiring at the grand old age of nine and a half.

Happy retirement! Janus the police dog, who has chalked up a remarkable 440 arrests in the last four years, is calling it a day at the age of nine-and-a-half. Janus is seen here with handler PC Dan Thomas

Paired with handler PC Dan Thomas in 2008, Janus has used his tracking and searching skills to secure the arrest of 285 crime suspects.

He also assisted in a further 157 captures – scaling 6ft high fences and chasing down sprinting suspects.

On top of that, the sharp-toothed sleuth left around 60 criminals needing hospital treatment for bite injuries after coming off worst in their encounters with him.

PC Thomas said: ‘Janus has depended on me and I’ve equally depended on him many times when he’s come to my aid and fended off violent offenders.’

The officer and Janus have been nominated for numerous awards in the West Midlands including two Chief Constable Commendations – the force’s  highest accolade – and three local policing commendations.

‘You could tell he really loved the job,’ said PC Thomas. ‘A walk with Janus always had to involve some training as he wants to stay active and not just go for a stroll.

‘Janus been involved in some  fantastic arrests and used his search skills to uncover a huge array of stolen property and evidence that’s led to convictions.’

Described by PC Thomas as ‘one of the force’s finest’, Janus’s haul of recovered property has included knives, screwdrivers, clothing,  stolen items and cash.

In one incident he uncovered £5,000 stolen from a security van heist and in another sniffed out more than £10,000 worth of stolen power tools.

PC Thomas, who is keeping Janus as a pet, said: ‘He’s an excellent dog in so many ways: extremely sociable, very playful, agile, fast and highly driven to work. Janus will live out his days with my  family and I.

‘He’ll be given the best care and attention and rightly so.

‘He’s been a pleasure to train, work and live with and if I could turn the clock back and work him again I would.”

Janus joined West Midlands Police as a pup around eight years ago, but it was not until he joined frontline duties with PC Thomas that he really made his mark.  The officer will now work with police dog Zane, who graduated from the force’s breed and training scheme.

West Midlands Police Dog Unit manager, Inspector Russ Evans, said: ‘At the time of his retirement, Janus was among the oldest operational general purpose dogs we’ve ever had. There are no set retirement dates for our dogs.

‘It all depends on the individual dog and Janus was still scaling  6ft fences and chasing down suspects in his final few months with the force.’

West Midlands Police began recruiting Belgian Malinois, or shepherd  dogs, around ten years ago.

Inspector Evans said: ‘They exhibit energy levels that are among the highest of all dog breeds, love new challenges and are relatively easy to obedience train.’
