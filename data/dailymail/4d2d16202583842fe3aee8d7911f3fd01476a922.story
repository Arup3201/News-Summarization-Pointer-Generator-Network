This is the moment a swarm of termites descended upon a group of residents in a Chinese apartment block.

Disturbing pictures show a group of people covering their mouths and running for cover in the lobby of the apartment block in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality.

Another woman can be seen calling a lift while holding what appears to be a fly swatter and a cloud of the insects buzz around her head.

Eventually, one brave man attempts to kill the insects by squirting them with a bottle of insect repellant.

And his tactics pay off - with a later image showing hundreds of dead termites lying on the rather dirty looking floor of the apartment lobby.

The termite attack is believed to have taken place on Thursday.

It is not known how the insects got in to the building - or whether there is any suggestion the block of apartments is prone to this kind of infestation.

Termites are a group of eusocial insects - i.e. they work as a cooperative like ants. Each group can have anywhere from several hundred to several million members.

One resident squirts the insects with a bottle of pesticide - instantly killing scores of the creatures

They mainly feed on dead plants, wood, leaf litter and animal dung - and are of considerable ecological importance due to their role in recycling such substances.

They are believed to communicate to one another using a variety of activities and signals.

When they infest a home, they can cause substantial damage by eating through the wooden structures of the property

Termite infestations are usually dealt with by using a variety of chemical treatments or minimum risk pesticides.
