Manuel Pellegrini believes Manchester City have the firepower to propel themselves to the top of the Premier League – despite having no fit strikers available.

The champions can move into pole position on Saturday if they beat Crystal Palace by a four-goal margin.

But they must do so without Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko, who are out until the new year, and Stevan Jovetic, who will not be fit until Boxing Day at the earliest.

It leaves Pellegrini desperately short of options up front. James Milner could be used as a false No 9, while Samir Nasri, David Silva and 18-year-old Jose Angel Pozo are also contenders for the role. Pellegrini says he has faith in his squad to cope.

‘None of them are fit so we have to arrange without Jovetic, without Dzeko, without Kun (Aguero),’ the Chilean said.

‘We will try to play in another way. I hope that midfielders will arrive from the second line and we will score in another way.

‘We will have to change our way to play, a different system because when you don’t have strikers you must arrive at the goal in a different way.

‘I hope we will do it. I know that we play against a team that defend very well so we will see what is the best solution to play without them.’

Pellegrini says contract negotiations with Joe Hart and Milner are progressing, despite no announcement being made.

The 18-year-old Jose Angel Pozo is also an option for City to consider -he has made his first appearances for the club this season

Hart is poised to sign a five-year deal but reports have suggested talks over Milner’s proposed four-year contract have stalled.

‘We are talking with James,’ Pellegrini said. ‘It is not easy for all the players to sign a new contract.

‘There are a lot of things to talk, to decide, discuss. I hope finally James will sign his contract. I repeat, the same as with Joe Hart, he wants to stay and the club wants to keep him.’
