Police today cautioned publisher Iain Dale for wrestling a protester to the ground as he tried to disrupt a TV interview with controversial spin doctor Damian McBride.

The bizarre scene on the Brighton seafront saw Mr Dale grappling with anti-nuclear campaigner Stuart Holmes who regularly holds up placards during live TV broadcasts.

Mr Dale today attended Brighton police station to accept the caution, before issuing a grovelling apology including offering to buy Mr Holmes a new placard.

Protest: Even after being pushed to the ground, Mr Holmes tried to get his message across

Dignified: Viewers had no idea what was going on, as Mr Dale made his move

Mr Dale's extraordinarily intervention came as Mr McBride was plugging his explosive memoirs Power Trip on ITV's Daybreak on Tuesday morning.

Mr Holmes often appears in the background of TV broadcasts, holding up placards campaigning against nuclear power.

As he tried to use the interest in the McBride book to further his cause this morning, he came up against Mr Dale, who runs BiteBack, the firm publishing Power Trip.

The barking of the protester's dog - which eagerly joined in the commotion - could be heard by TV viewers as the struggle continued.

But the terrier - carrying placards reading 'No Nukes' on its back - failed to live up to the loyalty expected from dogs, jumping up and biting its owner on the rear. 

Sussex Police said a 50-year-old man from Pembury, Kent, voluntarily attended a police station today, admitted common assault and received a police caution.

Chief Superintendent Paul Morrison said: 'We respect the rights of people to protest peacefully. We will investigate fairly any allegation regardless of who is involved and we will seek the most appropriate resolution.'

Immediately after the incident Mr Dale remained defiant, writing on Twitter: 'Oh dear, I seem to have gone 
nuclear... Mirror photographer tells me I did what the snappers have 
wanted to do for years!'

But today he struck a more regretful tone, apologising to Mr Holmes as well as his own family, friends, work colleagues and even Labour leader Ed Miliband.

Writing on his blog, Mr Dale said: 'I
did apologise personally to Mr Holmes on Tuesday afternoon and we shook
hands. He agreed to let the matter rest, but I have no complaint that 
he changed his mind on reflection.

'Since the events of Tuesday I have 
gone through what happened over and over again in my mind. Whatever I 
felt at the time, nothing can justify what I did.

'In addition, having accepted my 
guilt, I feel I should make some sort of reparation to Mr Holmes. I will
pay for a new placard for him and also make a donation to a charity of 
his choice.'

Fight: Others piled in to help Mr Dale in his efforts to stop the broadcast being interrupted

Publicity: Protester Mr Holmes is a regular on the media circuit, hoping to see his banners caught on camera

Mr Dale said he has been told by police that they regard the matter as closed and he thanked them for 'the fair and courteous way they have dealt with me throughout'.

He went on: 'Above all I want to issue this public apology for my behaviour.

'I want to apologise and say sorry to Stuart Holmes, who is a passionate campaigner and well known to everyone who attends party conferences and was perfectly entitled to do as he did on Tuesday in trying to get attention for his causes. It was totally out of character for me to react to him in the way I did.

'I also want to apologise for the blogpost I wrote after the incident. It was full of absurd bravado and in the heat of the moment I behaved in a frankly idiotic way.

'I have embarrassed not only myself but my family and my work colleagues and I apologise to them.

'I also want to apologise to Labour leader Ed Miliband and his conference attendees.'

Explosive: Damian McBride's memoirs Power Trip have rocked the Labour party conference in Brighton

During Tuesday's TV interview Mr 
McBride defended his decision to release the book, lifting the lid on 
the culture of lies and smears in the last Labour government, during the
Labour conference.

He told Daybreak: 'Two separate things
- why I decided to write the book is I wanted to tell my story about my
time in politics and all the lessons that I learnt from it and, indeed,
the lessons that both the Labour party and other parties can learn from
the way that I got brought into the political system and the way that 
effectively started to operate in a way that was unacceptable.

'In
terms of why I’m publishing it now, I was always going to write this 
book at some stage, I had more lucrative offers to publish it close to 
the general election when it would have caused more of a distraction and
chose not to do that. I though the earlier I published it the better.'
