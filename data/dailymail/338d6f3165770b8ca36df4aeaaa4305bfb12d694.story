A security blunder at Downing Street today saw a bin lorry and its crew stuck at the gate for more than 20 minutes after being caught on an anti-terror barrier.

The SITA dustcart and its two crew members were left marooned at about 11.20am after driving through the gates to Downing Street and across the barrier which rises out from the ground to block unauthorised access.

However, as the lorry was about halfway across someone or something caused the barrier to rise and wedge itself under the vehicle.

Onlookers said it took about 20 minutes of back and forth between the driver and police at the gate before the barrier was eventually lowered and the truck was allowed in.

One witness said: 'It was an embarrassing blunder.

'I felt sorry for the binmen who were just trying to do their job.'

The incident, which completely blocked the entrance to Downing Street, happened after David Cameron had already left for Prime Minister's Questions at the House of Commons.

It is not the first vehicle to be hit by the anti-terror ring of steel surrounding the seat of power.

Trapped: The security barriers, designed to stop vehicles ramming the PM's residence, were released too early

In 2010 former cabinet member Peter Mandelson's gleaming silver Jaguar XJ 2.7 diesel was trapped on one of the ramps.

The four-door Jaguar, which was waiting to take Lord Mandelson on to his next appointment, had to be loaded on to the back of a breakdown lorry and carted off for emergency repairs.

Other powerful men and women have also come a cropper outside the iconic residence.

Home secretary Theresa May nearly fell over when her shoe stuck in a pavement crack in january 2012.

The 56-year-old had to remove her foot and rest it on the pavement while she fished her shoe out of the crack.

Luckily, she emerged unscathed - and saw the funny side as she shared a laugh with photographers.

Just weeks after the Coalition had made its first few faltering steps, Education Secretary Michael Gove took a tumble as he got out of his official car.

Mr Gove's left foot appeared to slip off the kerb and he ended up on his knees as he made his way to a Cabinet meeting.

Political mis-steps: Gabby Bertin, former press secretary to David Cameron breaks a heel in the same place that Theresa May got stuck in the pavement

Fortunately it seems only his pride was dented as he managed a deep breath and an abashed smile before hurrying inside No10.

And in march 2011 Gabby Bertin, David Cameron’s glamorous half-French press secretary, snapped a heel on her £375 Christian Louboutin designer leather stilettos in the same spot as Mrs May.

The high heel on one of the red-soled shoes embarrassingly broke in two as she walked up Downing Street.
