This hilarious video shows the moment a mother and her four children were left to deal with a wolf spider hiding in their curtains.

The two-minute clip shows Jennifer Marlowe, 27, waving a broom at her drapes and trying to bat the spider out of the window as one of her three daughters films the hysterics in their Vancouver home.

Daughters Madison, nine, Hailey, seven, Sophia, seven, and son Aiden, three, are heard screaming in the background, while their British Bulldog T.J. barks to add to the pandemonium. 

Jennifer Marlowe's children filmed as she tried to bash a wolf spider out of her home in Vancouver

The mother-of-four, who is clearly scared of spiders, hit the curtains with a broom as she tried to knock the arachnid off 

One daughter can be heard giving instructions to Mrs Marlowe on how to deal with the spider, suggesting that she knock it on to the floor so they can use a vacuum cleaner to suck it up.

Halfway through the chaos, one of the Marlowe girls, from Vancouver, turns the phone camera used to film the uproar around to film herself, explaining that they 'are recording this of a spider - a wolf spider'.

The arachnids, which can grow to up an inch-and-a-half in size, are known for their aggressive behaviour when threatened and can grow to up to four inches in size.

The spiders, which can bite but are not considered dangerously venomous, are common in Vancouver - but not in the Marlowe's seventh-floor condo, it seems.

After two minutes of bashing the spider with a broom, it falls to the floor, causing the family to scream.

The girls, and even Mrs Marlowe, let out piercing screams as they clamber on to a bed and scarper from the room.

Just after one of Mrs Marlowe's daughters (left) explains what they are doing, the spider drops to the floor and the family run from the screaming (right)

While the spider appears to have made an escape, man of the house Tim Marlowe revealed that it was caught before long.

He said: 'Jen sprayed the spider with spider spray, and it ran and hid. The next day she found it dead in the bathroom - another large event at my house.'

He also assured MailOnline that that he and Aiden are not scared of spiders.
