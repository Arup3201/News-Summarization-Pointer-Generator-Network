A couple whose baby was stillborn have spoken of their ‘horrendous ordeal’ after a hospital admitted she would have lived if it was not for a series of blunders.

Deborah and Richard Horners' daughter Abbie was delivered stillborn on August 17 2011 following an emergency C-section.

The couple say their baby cannot be brought back but that if the hospital were to apologise and learn from the mistakes then they would be able to move on with their lives.

Richard and Deborah Horners' baby, Abbie, was stillborn as a result of a catalogue of errors at St James's University Hospital in Leeds

The NHS trust which runs St James’s 
University Hospital in Leeds has admitted liability and agreed an 
undisclosed settlement with the family.

According to the family’s lawyers, an investigation found that Abbie’s death was caused by a catalogue of errors and poor communication by medics which led to her brain being starved of oxygen.

The midwife in charge of Mrs Horner’s care was referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council and given a 12-month suspension order, the lawyers said. She has now retired.

‘To this day we are still shocked and appalled by what we went through and the tragic loss of our daughter Abbie,’ said Mrs Horner, 46, who lives in north Leeds.

‘To know that our baby would have been born healthy had it not been for the failures to report her abnormal heartbeat is incredibly difficult to come to terms with.

‘Everyone makes mistakes but there are lives at stake and my baby deserved the best possible care but, sadly, both she and I were failed.’

Abbie was delivered by emergency C-section but she had suffered catastrophic brain damage

Mrs Horner added: ‘My family have not even received an apology despite the trust’s admission. This is just shocking and has left us very angry.

‘It is just beyond belief how you could treat someone like that.

‘We never want anyone else to have to suffer the same heartache we did, and although we know the trust said improvements would be made immediately, we want to see proof of this.

‘Nothing will ever bring our daughter back but if they can apologise and prove that lessons have been learnt and shared across the NHS then hopefully we can start to put this horrendous ordeal behind us and try and re-build our lives.’

Kelly Morris, a lawyer at Irwin Mitchell who represents the couple, said Abbie’s death was completely avoidable.

She explained how Mrs Horner’s pregnancy was considered high risk as she was 43-years-old and had previously suffered a miscarriage, yet no delivery or induction plan was agreed for her.

Ms Morris said an internal investigation into the midwife in charge’s actions found breaches including the misinterpretation of the foetal heart trace, inadequate and inaccurate record keeping, failure to keep mother and baby the focus of care and failure to act within trust guidance.

Ms Morris said: ‘The loss of baby Abbie has truly devastated Deborah and Richard because she should still be alive today.

‘Despite having the technology to identify when a baby’s heartbeat is irregular or weak through the CTG machine, changes on the monitor were not reported correctly for a period of eight hours which prevented the appropriate action, such as an emergency caesarean, being taken sooner.

‘This meant that Abbie suffered catastrophic brain damage.

‘We welcome the fact the trust has admitted responsibility for the failings but it is concerning that Deborah and Richard have not had an apology for their loss.

‘Abbie’s death was completely avoidable and we hope that the action plan drawn up by the trust has been shared throughout the NHS to ensure the same mistakes are not repeated and patient safety is protected.’

Julian Hartley, Chief Executive of Leeds
 Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ‘The events leading up to the loss 
of Abbie fell far short of the high standards of care we normally 
provide and for this I am very sorry.

‘A full investigation led by a senior
 doctor was undertaken into the failure to recognise and escalate 
concerns in the labour care.

‘This
 report has been shared with Mr and Mrs Horner and I can reassure them 
that we are committed to using this to ensure we learn from every aspect
 of what happened.

The hospital has accepted liability for Abbie's death and has agreed an undisclosed settlement with the family

‘Quite rightly our clinical staff have to be accountable for their actions.’

Mr Hartley said the midwife concerned was immediately removed from practice and referred to the Local Supervisory Authority Midwifery Officer.

He said she subsequently chose to retire and is no longer employed by the trust.

He said: ‘In 2012, our head of midwifery and lead consultant met personally with Mr and Mrs Horner to discuss their concerns and to express their profound condolences and apologies.

‘I am very sad to hear that Mr and Mrs Horner feel they have not had an apology from the trust, as we have done our best to provide this.

‘As chief executive I would like to reiterate how sorry I am on behalf of everyone concerned in this tragic case.’
