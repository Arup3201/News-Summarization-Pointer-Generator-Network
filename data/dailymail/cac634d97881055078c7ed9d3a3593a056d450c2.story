MacIntrye alleges Ford conspired with
 Payman Aboodowleh, who coached football with Ford, to have one of their
 former players, who was also in jail at the time, to hurt him

Just as you thought things could not get any worse for Rob Ford, Toronto's crack-smoking mayor was ticketed on Friday night for jaywalking in Vancouver --  the same night video and photos emerged of him allegedly partying and posing for pictures with fans.

Canada's most notorious public official was in town for the funeral of former staffer David Price's mother when he was stopped by police for crossing the street on a red light.

The Global News reported that the mayor was walking on North Road when he was flagged by an officer outside a Shell gas station.

Eyewitness Ian Currie told The Global News that
 he overheard the mayor tell police officers: 'I f-ed up, boys... I 
thought it was looser on the West Coast, I thoughts you were cooler over
 here.'

Currie
 earlier told The Global News that Mr Ford had told them he was being 
ticketed for 'public drunkenness.' He later retracted his statement.

Ford's
 latest run-in with police drew a sizable crowd in Vancouver, with the 
hapless public servant allegedly pleading with onlookers not to take pictures of 
him because he is 'going to get in a lot of trouble.' 

However, Ford, who has been battling drug and alcohol addiction, is also believed to have ducked
 into a nearby pub called Foggy Dew earlier in the evening.

Various bar attendees took to Twitter, posting messages 'Rob Ford is at the foggy dew' and 'Got hammered with Rob Ford tonight,' The Globe and Mail reports.

Witness Michael Spencer told the Toronto Sun that around 8:45pm, he noticed Ford posing for pictures with fans.

'He was there with his friend who was out of the way because everybody wanted to take his picture with him. He was totally cool with it,' Spencer told The Toronto Sun.

Ford has expressed his shock over the ticketing -- and has claimed he was merely on his way to a Chinese restaurant across from his hotel. He also claimed that he only had consumed a Diet Coke that evening.

'I am in shock,' Ford said, according to the Toronto Sun. 'They went out of their way to do this. I said I support you guys. Did you arrest me because I am a Broncos fan?'

The incident comes just days after the embattled mayor was named in a lawsuit filed by his sister's ex-boyfriend for allegedly conspiring to have the man beaten in jail to prevent Ford's illicit behaviors from becoming known.

A lawsuit submitted Wednesday by Scott MacIntyre alleges the mayor was behind an assault at a Toronto jail in March 2012 that was intended to keep MacIntrye quiet about Ford's abuse of alcohol and drugs.

The lawsuit alleges MacIntrye was threatened with 'dire consequences' if he did not remain quiet. He was in jail after being charged with threatening the mayor, for saying he would expose his 'unsavory activities,' the lawsuit says.

Rob Ford may have some secrets he'd do anything to keep quiet

MacIntrye alleges Ford conspired with Payman Aboodowleh, who coached football with Ford, to have one of their former players, who was also in jail at the time, to beat MacIntyre up.

Ford and Aboodowleh arranged for staff members at the Metro West Detention Centre to 'ensure 'there was no supervision or surveillance of the area' where the alleged assault occurred, the lawsuit says.

Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, said the allegations are 'without fact or foundation.'

When questioned further if the mayor had conspired in any way to harm MacIntyre, Morris said, 'The answer is no.'

Ford offered no comment when reporters asked him about the lawsuit.

The mayor acknowledged last year that he had smoked crack, but he has rebuffed pressure to resign.

The lawsuit also names Ontario's Ministry of Correctional Services, which is responsible for the province's jails, Aboodowleh and Aedan Petros, the former football player who MacIntyre alleges attacked him.
