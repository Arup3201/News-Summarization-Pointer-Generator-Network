When bad things happen in good houses, there's only one man desperate homeowners should call: Randall Bell, Master of Disaster.

Dr Disaster: Randall Bell is a real estate appraiser who specializes in properties where disaster has struck

Laguna Beach, California resident Bell, 54, works as a consultant in diminution value, or stigmatized real estate.

In other words, he puts a price tag on properties that have been damaged by natural disasters or stigmatized by actual or perceived horrors, such as murders, suicides or, as in one recent case, accusations of being haunted by reality television shows.

Bell's services don't come cheap - his rate is $375 an hour.

He
 provides his clients with reports - sometimes 100 pages thick, 
with details on the property's problematic history, cases studies of 
similar troubles and the unmatched expert's final appraisal.

Bell's dominance and expertise in the field of stigmatized real estate has earned him the title of 'Master of Disaster.'

He
 has valued homes where some of the most infamous murders in U.S. 
history occurred, including Nicole Brown Simpson's condo, JonBenet 
Ramsey's home and Charles Manson victim Sharon Tate's mansion.

The father of four carved out his niche from a career in conventional property appraisal. 
After the 1992 Rodney King riots in LA he was called in to assess the damage 
and found his calling, deciding to focus only on damaged property.

'I love a challenge - the biggest, baddest, bring it on,' Mr Bell told the LA Times.

'Every day of the week, there are new places to go and new disasters.'

Stigmatized: Bell was called in to value the Rancho, Santa Fe mansion where police discovered the bodies of 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult

Grisly assignments: Bell has consulted on the house in Boulder, Colorado where JonBenet Ramsey was killed

Media attention: The more notorious a case is, says Bell, the more a property's value will be damaged, as in the case of Nicole Brown Simpson's condo

He's in hot demand due to an uncommon skill-set: Bell has the ability to adjust for for stigma as well as physical damage when he values a property.

The National Association of Realtors describes a stigmatized house as one 'that has been psychologically impacted by an event which occurred, or was suspected to have occurred, on the property, such event being one that has no physical impact of any kind.'

Television show Ghost Adventures recently featured a Las Vegas mansion, the halls of which, they claimed, stalks a 'nasty, evil spirit.'

This came as news to the property's owner Keith Resnick who wanted to sue the Travel Channel for damages for lost property value.

Apart from the physical damage from ghost-hunting vandals who broke into the home (and performed satanic rituals in its rooms) Resnick had to account for the loss of value due to the stigma now attached to the house.

Who was he going to call?

Bell visited the home four times before making his final appraisal, according to the LA Times.

Ghost Adventures claimed the house was the site of mob murders, though Bell found no evidence of any such thing.

But that fact made no difference - the property had been stigmatized by the claims, so Bell made his valuation as though the house had played host to grisly murders.

Resnick eventually sold the house earlier this year, though the final figure of the damages he's suing for remains confidential.

Terrorism: Randall Bell was called in to consult on the World Trade Center attacks in New York

Bell's skills are based on thorough research - he is uniquely qualified in his area of expertise, having traveled to every state in America, not to mention each continent in the world several times over, to observe the effects of disasters, terrorism, murder and suicide on properties.His work has taken him to Chernobyl, Hiroshima, the World Trade center site and the West Bank, where he was searching for comparisons of properties damaged by terrorists.

Bell told the LA Times that near the city of Hebron, a man threatened to kill him and his guide with a machine gun. Before he could make good on his threats, an air-raid siren went off, a bomb exploded and machine-gun fire deafened him.

'I hit my limit with Hebron,' he says.

New path: Bell's first taste of appraising damaged property came after the 1992 LA riots

His meticulous research makes him the go-to guy for governments and 
organizations seeking  put a figure on losses after mass disasters.

Bell has consulted on 
Hurricane Katrina, the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, the September 
11 attacks at the World Trade Center site, and the United Airlines 
Flight 93 crash site in Pennsylvania.

He explained to Today's Realtor that any reduction in value of a property due to stigma depends on the scope of the tragedy and the media attention it received.

According to Bell, there is usually a 15- to-25 per cent decrease in value for two or three years after the event, which then diminishes over a one- to-25-year period. 

Some cases are special, though. The Milwaukee apartment building in which Jeffrey Dahmer lived and murdered his parents caused a mass exodus of the entire neighborhood.

'Dahmer's crimes were so horrific that not only the building was stigmatized but also the neighborhood, and that's very unusual,' he says.

'Occupancy went from 80 per cent to 20 per cent, as people in adjoining buildings wanted to leave the neighborhood.'

The house was eventually demolished.

Value restored: The home where Sharon Tate was murdered by the infamous Manson Family was eventually sold two decades after the murder

A seller is obliged to tell you if the roof leaks - but do they have to tell you about the dark event in the basement?

Bell advises real estate agents that disclosure is the best policy.

More
 than 20 states have laws that clarify real-estate agents' duty to 
disclose psychological stigma and protect sellers from liability. The 
statutes vary from state to state - California's requires sellers to disclose a 
murder, but only within three years of the crime, and there is no 
requirement to disclose other felonies or suicide.

In any case, says Bell, all stigmas eventually fade. He says the owner of the house where Sharon Tate was so brutally murdered along with her unborn baby held onto the house for 20 years, then sold it at market value without any trouble at all.
