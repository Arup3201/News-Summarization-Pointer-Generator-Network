Bolivia's glaciers are melting - much faster than first predicted, and the blame is falling on airborne aerosol particles.

The Chacaltaya glacier made its slow trek down the Cordillera Real Mountains for 18,000 years.

By 2009 the glacier in southern America had gone, and even that was sooner than expected for researchers, who estimated in the 1990s that it would survive into 2015.

Now researcher Franceso Zaratti, from the Higher University of San Andres, suggests that aerosol particles are landing on the glaciers and speeding up their demise.

The Andes in Bolivia are losing their glaciers, which date back tens of thousands of years, at a rate which is astonishing scientists

He said: 'The phenomenon that we believe contributes more and that we are going to measure, is airborne aerosol particles that deposit on the glaciers and in turn increase their capacity to absorb energy and solar radiation.'

Most atmospheric aerosol particles are produced by natural processes such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires.

But man-made chemicals through industry, mass transportation and agriculture, as well as smog from nearby cities such as La Paz and El Alto are thought to be contributing.

The researchers are now investigating the area to test their theories.

Zaratti said: 'The most attractive thing of Chacaltaya is the altitude; I mean we're at 5,200 meters.

'At this altitude we are at what is believed to be a free and clean atmosphere.'

The glaciers are important to the area, providing water for the millions of people who live in La Paz and El Alto.

But the glaciers are expected to disappear between 2035 and 2045.

The scientists expect to show that aerosol particles are settling in the glaciers, increasing their capacity to absorb energy and solar radiation which in turn, causes the glaciers to melt faster.

They said by sharing this information they hope to provide answers to similar questions being posed by scientists around the world.

However, while the Bolivian mountains are losing their glaciers faster than expected, the Himalayan glaciers are melting far more slowly than predicted, according to a satellite study in February from the University of Colorado Boulder.

Previous estimates of ice loss in the high Asia mountains ranged up to 50 billion tons a year, said the university's Professor John Wahr.

The actual figure is a mere four billion tonnes, according to a survey using data from Nasa satellites.

Previously, it had been claimed that Himalayan glaciers would have melted to a fifth of current levels by 2035, leading to sea level rises and drought.

Those predictions used ground-based measurements, whereas the new study measured the effect of gravity on twin Nasa satellites to give an accurate measure of the mass of ice being lost.

‘The results in this region really were a surprise,’ said Wahr.

‘One possible explanation is that previous estimates were based on measurements taken primarily from some of the lower, more accessible glaciers in Asia and were extrapolated to infer the behavior of higher glaciers.

'But unlike the lower glaciers, many of the high glaciers would still be too cold to lose mass, even in the presence of atmospheric warming.

‘What is still not clear is how these rates of melt may increase and how rapidly glaciers may shrink in the coming decades,’ said Professor Pfeffer.

‘That makes it hard to project into the future.’
