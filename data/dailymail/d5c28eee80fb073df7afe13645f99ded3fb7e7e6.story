It turns out that Aaron Hernandez, who currently stands accused of murder, isn't the only member of his family with a criminal past.

In 2001 Hernandez's mother Terri was arrested on gambling charges for working as a low-level bookie in a local gambling ring.

Though Hernandez , who now works as an administrative secretary at a local school, was charged with professional gambling and possession of gambling records, she never went to trial.

Terri Hernandez, mother of ex-pro football player Aaron Hernandez accused of murder, was charged with illegal gambling in 2001

Hernandez was arrested for accepting bets on basketball and football games from her home after police gathered evidence from a wire tape, The Hartford Courant reported.

The investigation turned up that Hernandez, mother of two, had been hired by Martin Hovanesian Jr., a local restaurant manger, to accept bets on college and professional basketball and football games, the paper reported.

A Statewide Organized Crime Investigative Task Force had been conducting a criminal investigation into Hovanesian's operation since late 2000, eventually executing a wiretap on Hernandez's phone lines.

Within two days the wiretap intercepted more than 200 telephone calls that 'constitute material evidence of the offenses 
of professional gambling' according to Bristol Superior Court court papers the paper cited.

With Hovanesian as the ring leader, investigators identified Hernandez as a low-level ranking player in the state-wide gambling ring in which she accepted wagers over the phone, The Daily News reported.

Mother of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez, was charged with professional gambling for taking illegal bets on sports games over the phone

Hernandez, who is now a secretary at a local elementary school, took bets on college and pro basketball and football games for $300 a week in 2001

'She wasn’t the brains of the operation. She was collateral, ' William Gerace, attorney for Hovanesian told The Daily News.

According to the newspaper Hernandez was paid $300 a week to accept bets over the phone and calculate gamblers wins and losses.

Hovanesian, who had been convicted of illegal gambling charges in the past, was charged with corrupted organization racketeering activity, the paper reported.

Instead of going to trial he plead guilty to the charges and paid a fine of $10,000.

Hernanez was never publicly tried for her crimes, though according to an arrest warrant affidavit cited by the news organization, she did speak to police about the ins and outs of Hovanesian's operation in an interview.

Her involvement in illegal sports betting came nine years before her son was signed to a NFL football team.

Terri Hernandez's son Aaron stands accused of the murder of Odin Lloyd and is currently being held without bail

Hernandez, now 54, leads a more quiet life as an administrative secretary at the South Side Elementary School in Bristol, Connecticut.

However, her life was once again been upended when her son, former New England Patriot's tight end Aaron Hernandez was charged with murder earlier this year. 

Hernandez, 23, is accused of killing Odin Lloyd, 27, who was found shot at an industrial complex just one mile north of the pro-footballer's mansion home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

After he son was charged with murder Terri Hernandez insisted upon his innocence.

'All I can say is that he will be cleared of all these charges in the end,' she told The Bristol Press. 'Just let it play out until the end.'

Since her son's arrest more tragedy has befallen the Hernandez family as his uncle died in a freak road accident just two months after Aaron was arrested.

Terri Hernandez's brother Michael J. Valentine was killed after he lost control of his moped in Bristol, Connecticut and crashed into a curb.

Valentine was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash.

All of these events seem to have taken their toll on Mrs. Hernandez.

'My brother’s dead and my son’s in jail,' she told The Daily News as she was leaving her home to go to work. 'No comment.'
