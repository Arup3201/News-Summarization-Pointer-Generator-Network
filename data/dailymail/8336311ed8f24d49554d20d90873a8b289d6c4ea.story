A globetrotting runner who set himself the challenge of running a mile every day has stretched his legs in 48 towns in five different countries.

Thanks to his work as a TV producer, Geoff Butler, 43, from Sacramento, California, ran in 22 states of the USA and visited cities in England, Scotland, Russia and France. 

Mr Butler, who took up running six 
years ago as a way to lose weight, carried a small camera with him on 
his runs and set it to film him as he completed his routes.

Mr Butler said: 'It took some planning, a lot of commitment and a little luck to pull off the challenge.

'I visit lots of different places for my job and I thought it would be neat to way to share my travelling experiences.

'I decided to run every day, and film short clips of me as I did so. I wanted to use the clips to make a short video as a way to share my travels with family and friends. 

'I knew I would be doing a lot of travelling in 2013 so it seemed like the perfect year to try it.'

The resulting video charts the epic challenge across the year, concluding with a sequence in which he and his wife Kim, 43, stop running to admire fireworks marking the start of 2014.

He said: 'I managed to lose a stone in weight while completing the challenge. 

'My daily run is my head-clearing time. Sometimes it’s difficult to think uninterrupted during the day and running really helps me sort out my thoughts.

Mr Butler, a television producer, said it was sometimes difficult to find time to run every single day. 

He said: 'In July I was travelling home from Scotland and my only chance to run was during a stop over in New Jersey.

'I took the airport train to the car rental office, changed in the toilet and ran circles around a car park. I cleaned up and put on fresh clothes before returning to the terminal to finish my journey home.'

Mr Butler’s work took him to London to produce coverage of Wimbledon, to Scotland to work on the Open Championships, to Moscow for the IAAF Athletics World Championships and all over the US for American football and basketball games.

He said: 'There were so many memorable runs during the year - routes which took my under the Eiffel Tower, along the Thames, through Gorky Park and on the John Muir Trail in Scotland.

'Running in Moscow was good. I mainly ran along the Moskva River. There is lots to see in that beautiful city. I hardly saw anyone else running and got lots of strange looks. Apparently running is not very popular there.

'I ran in several races too, including the Eugene Marathon in Oregon, a 5K on Wimbledon Common, and an 800-metre race on the track at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.

'In Sacramento, I once shared a trail with a coyote for about a mile while the sun set.'

Despite his globe-trotting challenge Mr Butler says his favourite place to run is his hometown of Sacramento, California.

'My city is a runner’s paradise. Of all the other places I travelled, Scotland had to be the most enjoyable for running. I loved the picturesque scenery and runner-friendly trails to explore.'
