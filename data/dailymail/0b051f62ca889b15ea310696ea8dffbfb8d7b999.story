Country music may be all about down-home values, but country musicians are displacing the biggest names in mainstream pop on the charts - and they're laughing all the way to the bank.

Forbes has announced its annual Country Cash Kings list, and the top five stars tallied a staggering $244 million combined over the past year.

And its not just music sales and concert tickets lining these crooners' pockets.

Country music mogul: Toby Keith has topped the list of top earners with $65 million from his restaurants, record label and music sales

Clothing lines, fragrances, restaurant chains and even a rum brand are bolstering business for these country moguls.

Number five on the list is Luke Bryan, who pulled in $34 million with the release of his album Crash My Party in August 2013.

He was the number-two selling artist overall, only behind Justin Timberlake, in 2013.

Next on the list is Jason Aldean, whose Burnin' it Down soared to number one on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, his ninth number one hit.

Third is Kenny Chesney with $44 million. He's been traveling on his No Shoes Nation tour, during which he plays shows to crowds in excess of 30,000 people.

Chesney is also launching his own rum, called Blue Chair Bay, which is likely to secure his spot on the list for next year, too.

Second is pop crossover Taylor Swift, whose huge success on the charts has resulted in endorsements from her own Ked's line and perfume to a film role opposite Jeff Bridges in the upcoming The Giver.

Swift may be the only female in the top five, but she more than holds her own. At just 24 years old, she raked in $64 million.

She was just pipped to the number one spot by Toby Keith, whose business interests range from a record label to a restaurant chain.

Here's what Forbes had to say about Keith:

'Keith doesn’t get as much mainstream acclaim as Diddy or Jay Z, but out-earned both this year with the help of a bevy of entrepreneurial ventures including his Show Dog label, a growing list of I Love This Bar And Grill restaurants, a multimillion-dollar endorsement deal with Ford, and his own Wild Shot mescal.'

In his own words, Keith said, 'I can put them on that 30-city tour. I don’t have to look for a place to play. It’s cost-effective as crap. They’re in Toby’s house. They’re drinking Toby’s liquor. That’s Toby’s act. And then we’re moving to the next town.'
