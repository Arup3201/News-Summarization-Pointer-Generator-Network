She has topped Vogue's list of the 
world's most stylish women, is the face of countless fashion brands and scores a much-coveted spot on every fashion show front row.

She
even inspired Mulberry's must-have Alexa bag which went on to sell in the thousands, so it is fair to say that Alexa Chung is one 
of the nation's best-loved fashion icons and influences.

And now the model and all-round style queen has caused a beauty flurry after she was snapped at the British Fashion Awards sporting this season's hottest new nail trend which - of course - isn't available to non fashionistas for another ten days.

Alexa Chung was spotted wearing the Nails Inc varnish when she collected her award at the British Fashion Awards last week

The 28-year-old, who took home the British Style Award for the third time, was rocking Nails Inc's Bling It On black leather and skulls set when she collected her shiny trophy and although the varnish hasn't yet hit stores the waiting already stands at 870 and is rising daily.

The model turned TV presenter caused a social media flurry when she tweeted: 'Aaaaannnnnndddd thanks @nailsinc for my leather nails! #kinky,' instantly transforming the leather effect black nail polish and crystal skull embellishments into a must-have beauty essential.

The Nails Inc Bling it On and Skulls aren't available yet but already have a waiting list of 870 which is rising by the day

Just like matte polishes, this polish applies glossy but will dry with a leather look texture to it and is sure to add a rock chick element to any outfit.

Sam Heath, Nails Inc Marketing Manager said: 'We presented the kit to press at our Spring Summer press showcase a few weeks ago and it started a social media frenzy as they all loved it so much.Â 

'The high profile BritishBeautyBlogger received 600 hits on her blog post about the leather polish in just one hour.

'Then we also presented to the US press and had a similar reaction,' she added.

The Nails Inc Leather & Skulls kit goes on sale exclusively with Selfridges and on nailsinc.com on 13th December and then nationwide on 20th December 2012.
