A late Formula One champion’s seven-bedroom mansion was today on the market for £5.8million.

James Hunt lived in the beautiful home in Wimbledon, south-west London, for more than a decade and was known for driving his Austin A35 van around the area before he died aged 45 in 1993.

The house, near Wimbledon Common, boasts a pool, half an acre of landscaped gardens, more than 7,000 sq ft of accommodation, five reception rooms, four bathrooms, a swimming pool and a library.

The Wimbledon residence was home to Mr Hunt between 1982 and his death in 1993

Going up: Knight Frank described the home as a 'country house in Wimbledon in an exceptionally wide plot'

Mr Hunt, who was twice married, once famously claimed to have slept with more than 5,000 women

The house was home to a menagerie of animals, including a German shepherd called Jackson, a foul-mouthed parrot called Humbert and budgerigars in a state-of-the-art aviary in the back garden.

Knight Frank described 
the mansion - where Hunt lived from 1982 to 1993 - as a ‘country house in Wimbledon in an exceptionally wide plot 
formerly owned by the Formula One World Champion'.

The estate agents'
description also said: ‘There is excellent entertaining space including
a large drawing room with character fireplace, library, dining room, 
family room plus a study.

‘Unusually
all the bedrooms are on one floor and there is a second staircase 
linking the two floors. There is a useful indoor exercise pool and large
integral garage plus plenty of off-street parking.'

Twice-married
Hunt had two children and famously once claimed to have slept with over
5,000 women. He was a poster boy for F1 in the Seventies and won the 
world championship in 1976.

The driver later proposed to girlfriend Helen Dyson, now 47, the day before he died of a heart attack.
