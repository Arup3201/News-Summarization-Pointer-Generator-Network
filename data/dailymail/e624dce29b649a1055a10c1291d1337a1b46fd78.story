Founder: The charity was set up by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996

A leading children’s charity is facing a crisis after three of its directors resigned amid an apparent row over funding, it was revealed yesterday.

Kids Company has received around £30 million of public money since 2008 and has celebrity backers including rock group Coldplay, businessman Sir Richard Branson and Harry Potter author JK Rowling.

Set up by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996, it supports 36,000 vulnerable children in London, Bristol and Liverpool and has been championed by Prince Charles and David Cameron. 

But concerns about the way the charity is run are understood to have led some senior managers to raise issues with its board of trustees. 

The resignations of interim finance director Diane Hamilton, human resources chief Adrian Stones and director of development Mandy Lloyd then followed.

A statement from Kids Company said: ‘It was with great regret that they felt unable to continue working within the organisation because of the uncertainty of funding, which led to high levels of stress in the workplace which was unsustainable.’

But a source close to the directors reportedly said: ‘These departures are a direct result of these employees’ doubts about the future of Kids Company ... The trustees were told of their doubts but they don’t seem to have reacted at all.’

Miss Batmanghelidjh, a trained psychotherapist, became known as ‘Mother Camila of Camberwell’ for her work with some of South London’s most disadvantaged children.

Michael Gove is said to have tried to prevent a grant of up to £8 million being given to the charity in 2012

Born in Iran, she is known for her colourful style. In 2013 she was named one of Britain’s 100 most powerful women by Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour and appointed a CBE.

The Sunday Times reported that the resignations were revealed as she denied persuading Mr Cameron to intervene after then education secretary Michael Gove tried to prevent a grant of up to £8 million being given to the charity in 2012.

Miss Batmanghelidjh said that an independent audit in 2014 showed ‘the charity was well run but lacked funding’. But critics have questioned whether it is over-staffed – it employs around 600 people.
