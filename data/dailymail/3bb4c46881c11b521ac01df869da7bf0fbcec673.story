A tourist has seriously injured his back and spine after 'tombstoning' 30ft off a pleasure pier into just 2ft of water.

Witnesses said the man in his early 20s was unaware the tide had been going out when he jumped from the Grand Pier in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.

He was dragged to the beach by friends and taken to hospital as police issued fresh warnings over the craze, which has led to several deaths.

Injured: Paramedics rescue a man who leaped from the Grand Pier in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, yesterday into 2ft of water. He suffered serious spinal injuries after reportedly thinking the water was deeper

Toll: Horrified onlookers watched as the man was stretchered off the beach and into a waiting ambulance

It is not yet known whether the man suffered lasting injuries.

The incident happened just before 11.30am yesterday, around an hour after high tide.

Paramedics and the Great Western Air Ambulance were called to the pier, which is one of Britain's most popular and had a £39million refit four years ago following a major fire.

A South Western Ambulance service spokesperson said: 'It was reported a man in his 20s had jumped from the pier.

'A bystander reported that he thought the man had jumped thinking the water was deeper than it was.

As the tourist was taken to hospital, a police spokesman said: 'It may seem like fun but people are gambling with their lives against the power of the sea by jumping into unknown waters. It is just not worth it'

'The man sustained serious leg and back injuries. We sent a fast response vehicle, an ambulance and the Great Western air ambulance.

'He has been taken by land ambulance to Southmead Hospital in Bristol.'

A witness added: 'The guy was with some friends who were on holiday and he jumped off the pier, but he didn't know the tide was going out.

'The water is very still at the minute and it's hard to tell the tide is moving but underneath it's like somebody has pulled a plug.

'He must have jumped 30ft and landed in 2ft of water. He was badly hurt and they had him on a stretcher giving him oxygen.'

Injury: The craze of tombstoning has lead to several deaths. It is not known if the man suffered lasting injuries

Tombstoning is not illegal but police have branded it a 'potentially lethal pursuit'. 

The craze of tombstoning has lead to a number of deaths in Britain. The UK's first known fatality was Stephen Royston, 24, who jumped 100ft into a water-filled quarry at Kit Hill, Cornwall, in 2003.

Last month 18-year-old Cameron Lancaster was found in Preston Hill Quarry in Inverkeithing, Fife, after reportedly jumping into the deep water in a new take on the 'ice bucket challenge'. 

And last year 15-year-old Dan Mccullagh drowned after he jumped into the River Nene, Northamptonshire, while ‘tombstoning’ with friends on the hottest day of the year.  

A police spokesman said: 'This is a reckless activity and even in calmer waters it can be extremely dangerous.

'We, along with the Coastguard, are trying to deter young people from this potentially lethal pursuit and we strongly advise against it.

'It may seem like fun but people are gambling with their lives against the power of the sea by jumping into unknown waters.

'It is unfortunately the case that if they carry on they are likely to end up with serious, life-changing injury or even death. This risk-taking behaviour is just not worth it.'
