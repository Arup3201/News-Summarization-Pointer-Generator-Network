Edwin van der Sar believes Brazil are the favourites to win the World Cup because they will be able to handle the conditions the better than any other team.

Luiz Felipe Scolari's side are going in search of their sixth World Cup and will have the advantage of playing at home.

And former Dutch keeper Van der Sar, who won 130 caps for his country, says Brazil are the team to beat.

Van der Sar told Laureus Sport: 'I think Brazil are clear favourites because of the weather, the humidity, the warmth, the expectation from the people. 

'And besides, there are so many good football players that they can put two or three teams in the World Cup. So I think it will be very hard for an outsider, or maybe a European team, to get to the final and try to win it.  I think Brazil will win for the sixth time.'

But when it comes to individual star, the ex-Manchester United keeper is in no doubt who will shine, he added: 'My friend Cristiano Ronaldo. I played a couple times against him in 2006 and 2008.  We always lost and I think it is fair to say that Ronnie could well be top scorer of the tournament.'

Van der Sar has also tipped England's Joe Hart to have a long and successful career ahead of him – despite suffering difficulties earlier this season when he was dropped by City earlier in the season.

Van der Sar added: 'I think sometimes it is not bad to have a period that you are making mistakes and maybe you are on the bench for a couple of games.

'Maybe that helps to bring back your focus and the desire and the will. I think the second part of the season, he really performed at the level that he is capable of.

'The save that comes in my mind is the one he did against Everton for Manchester City.

'Those are the saves that you want to make and shows that you are ready for business. Hopefully the pressure of the nation is not going to be too much on him.

Turning it around: Joe Hart can be one of the best keepers in the World

'He is 27. I was 28 when I went to Juventus; I was 30 when I came to Fullham and I was 34 when I went to Manchester United.

'So, it is a long path that you have to go.  Hopefully he has a long career, and normally as a goalkeeper, you keep getting better and better by the games you play.

'I think the little dip he had at beginning of the season he was not meant to have.  Hopefully you get the right captain and the right motivation and right hunger and desire back.

'Of course I made mistakes also and everybody makes mistakes. You need to learn from them.'
