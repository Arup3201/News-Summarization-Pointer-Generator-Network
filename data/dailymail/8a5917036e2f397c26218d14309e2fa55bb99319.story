A 100-person brawl has landed a police officer in hospital and ended with 12 people being arrested.

The fight took place at North Ipswich Reserve - west of Brisbane in Queensland - about 5pm on Sunday.

Queensland Police Service officers were trying to arrest a man at a football match and they allege 'a large number of other people' tried to intervene.

A police officer was injured during a 100-person brawl in Ipswich - west of Brisbane in Queensland

While the man was being placed into a police vehicle, it is also alleged a senior constable was punched in the head, causing him to fall face-first onto a concrete gutter.

Other police units were called to the scene to break up the fight and 12 people were arrested.

Ipswich Police District Inspector Keith McDonald told Daily Mail Australia they had arrested the first man because he was acting 'inappropriately' after the game.

'He was arrested and subsequently things have gone down hill from there,' he said.

'Members of his family and the crowd have then become involved and the crowd swelled.'

Spectators were the only people involved in the brawl. 

It started off with just a few members of the crowd and then escalated

Insp McDonald later told reporters the man had been making obscene gestures at a group of people leaving the venue and despite being asked by police to stop, he continued with the behaviour.

It was then that police arrested him for failing to obey police directions.

'The rest of the family and other members of the crowd have become involved in a continual movement of harassment towards police officers,' he said. 

Insp McDonald said alcohol played a role in the incident and condemned those who were involved.

'Police aren't going to be punching bags or assaulted by members of the community,' he said.

He added that the senior constable who was hospitalised was 'extremely lucky' he did not suffer more severe injuries. 

The senior constable was taken to St Andrews Private Hospital with facial injuries to the forehead, nose, right cheek and jaw but has since been released.
