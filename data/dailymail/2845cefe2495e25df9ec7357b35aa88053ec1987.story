Parts of Britain have woken up to scenes straight out of a fairy tale this morning, as freezing conditions cast a magical spell over the country.

This stunning icicle creation has appeared alongside an Dorset road after passing cars splashed water over a small tree in the freezing temperatures.

The breathtaking results are long icicles that dangle precariously from the branches and bushes.

It is likely that they have formed due to freezing conditions over the weekend which dipped at a low -4 degrees celsius.

Passers-by could be seen admiring the icicle wall and taking photographs of the unusual sight. Drivers could be seen craning their necks to get a good look at the scene as they pass through the road in Bournemouth, Dorset

Driver Paul Collins, 33, said: 'It looks like an ice sculptor has placed it there, you could imagine it on a display somewhere.

'It's also the sort of thing you would expect to see in places like Alaska.

'I have seen several other drivers stopped their cars and get out to have a look and take some pictures. It's very pretty.'

Helen Chivers, a weather forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'There is a big puddle on the road in the picture so when cars drive through, it is splashing on the hedge and freezing.

'The temperatures over the weekend got down to -4 degrees celcius and although it has increased to around 5 degrees celcius during the days now, it is still very cold at night.

'What has caused the cold temperatures is a weather pattern that has brought cold air over from Scandinavia and west Russia.

'We also had North Easterly winds blowing with clear skies at night which has made the temperature drop.

'It's definitely still winter and February is the coldest month.'

Britain could be facing the coldest 
Easter on record as freezing temperatures show no sign of letting up 
before the Bank Holiday.

And more snow could also be on the way bringing potential travel misery for those planning a weekend getaway.

Bookies
have cut the odds of a white Easter break to just 2-1 and are offering 
8-1 that it is the coldest ever amid warnings that temperatures will 
remain below average throughout March.

February could yet turn out to be the 
coldest since 1996 with many parts of the country finding themselves covered in blankets of snow.

Although spring officially begins on March 1 the chilly weather looks set to delay its arrival for a good while longer.

Temperatures fell to as low as -8 in Aviemore and Braemar in Scotland yesterday and will not reach more than 5C across the country before the weekend.

The first days of March will be largely dry but bitterly cold as Arctic winds continue to blow in from the north.

The north will see temperatures as low as -1C while the south will stay hovering around 2C.

Sunday will prove to be a little warmer with temperature rising to 3C in most parts of the country.

A Met Office spokeman said although it was too early to predict whether there will be more snow at Easter, temperatures in March will 'certainly be lower than average.'

Motorists could be hit by more blizzards such as these which affected County Durham last weekend

Freezing temperatures have brought snow to many parts of the UK during February and look set to continue

Travellers could face more misery if snow arrives before Easter and disrupts Britain's airports
