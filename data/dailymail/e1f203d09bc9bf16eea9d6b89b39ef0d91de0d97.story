Aussie sport stars spent their whopping pay cheques wisely last year by investing in multi-million dollar luxurious homes to comfortably live in with their families.

Some of Australia's biggest male sportsmen splashed out on properties in Sydney's exclusive eastern suburbs with uninterrupted million-dollar ocean views.

However, it wasn't all about buying property in 2014 with many sporting champions selling up before moving onto an even more extravagant place to call home.

Proving that even A-listers are not immune from the unpredictable property market - not all of the sporting legends made a profit from their sales.

Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke, and his wife Kyly, made the big move from the Sutherland Shire to Sydney's affluent eastern suburbs in May last year before the devastating death of Clarke's best mate and fellow cricketer Phil Hughes.

The harbouside five bedroom mansion nestled in Vaucluse demanded a cool $8.5million which is believed to have had an original price tag of around $9.5 million.

The couple had to place their waterfront Lilli Pilli property on the market in November after it failed to sell in August for $2.4 million - $470,000 below what he originally purchased for in 2006. 

The Clarke's eventually pocketed $2.55 million - a big drop from the $2.87 million they paid for the property.

In a slightly more modest move, Sydney's glamorous power couple Anthony Minichiello and Terry Biviano bought a run-down  property for more than $3 million, also in Vaucluse.

The new neighbours to The Clarke's sold their  waterfront Bondi Beach penthouse, also in Sydney's eastern suburbs, for nearly $2 million in July.

Their recently purchased harbourside home was built in the 1970s and is in its original condition.

Another eastern suburbs sale was made in March last year, by cricketer David Warner and his fiancee iron-woman Candice Falzon coughed up  $6.5million for a South Coogee waterfront mansion.

The property made headlines in 2013 as the set for vulgar UK reality show Geordie Shore and then again as Kylie Minogue's Australian base during filming of The Voice's live shows.

The six bedrooms and five bathrooms home has three levels of 180-degree views from Coogee to Bondi, a terrace and a swimming pool.

The latest cricketer to jump on the property bandwagon, and forking out one of the biggest price tags, is Australian batsman Shane Watson and his wife Lee who paid bought a $9million home in Bronte, also in Sydney's exclusive eastern suburbs.

The lavish four-year-old property was sold before the auction date of November 1 2014, with records suggesting it was settled in December. 

The home is positioned in one of the most privileged streets in Bronte, with an elevated position that offers spectacular ocean views of Bronte and Tamarama beach - and a full-size pool for the days you feel like avoiding the crowds.

Meanwhile, bookie and racing identity, Tom Waterhouse, snapped up a luxurious waterfront home in Balmoral, on Sydney's north shore, for $13million in October last year- so keen he is believed to have paid $2million over the asking price.

The home delivers an outstanding beachfront allotment set upon a peaceful and private heaven.

It's one of only five privileged homes with direct waterfront views of the beach, and features four bedrooms and four bathrooms.

With inspired design elements which capitalise on the magnificent setting, the home has expansive formal living and dining areas and an entertainment area with striking panoramas.

The property features a gated entry, an elevated garden terrace with superb views, and rear and side alfresco terraces for private entertaining.

AFL star Lance 'Buddy' Franklin sold his Melbourne home for a generous $1.73 million after settling into Sydney and his new role with the Sydney Swans.

The 27-year-old made a profit of $95,000 from the November sale of the four-bedroom house in Brighton East in the city's southeast.

The former Hawthorn player purchased the modern two-storey house on a 678 square metre block for $1,635,000 back in 2010, with his recent sale reflecting an annual price gain of under 1.5 per cent.

It took more than 250 days, but tennis ace Lleyton Hewitt, and his wife Bec, finally sold their Palm Beach home in November last year.

The couple who mainly reside in the Bahamas, put the property on the market back in February for $5.5million, a price which was later reduced to $5million in July.

The designer crash pad is mere metres from the golden sands of Northern Sydney's famous Palm Beach, where Bec, 31, once filmed scenes for the hit soap Home And Away.

An enormous sun-filled terrace looks perfect for al fresco dining or throwing a shrimp on the barbie - it would certainly have suited the active Aussie family with their three little ones, Mia, 8 Cruz, 5 and Ava, 3.

It comes several months after the tennis legend sold his Adelaide home and re-listed his Melbourne apartment for sale.

The West Lakes Adelaide residence served Lleyton up a loss after he bought it in 2003 for $3.2million and sold it for an amount Daily Mail Australia was told was 'in the mid $2millions.'

Meanwhile, his St. Kilda penthouse was put up for $10million - almost $2million more than the $8.325million Property Observer reported he bought it for in 2004.

Lleyton and his family primarily reside in their home at the Bahamas which was reportedly purchased for $3.8million.
