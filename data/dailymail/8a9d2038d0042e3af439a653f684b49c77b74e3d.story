Innocent victim: Sabrina Moss, 24, was shot dead while out celebrating her birthday with friends

A young mother caught up in a double shooting in London while out celebrating her 24th birthday has died of her injuries.

Sabrina Moss was one of two women gunned down in North-West London early yesterday. The other casualty, also 24, was last night in hospital with injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening.

Detective Chief Inspector John Sandlin of the Metropolitan Police said: ‘I believe the two women were innocent parties who were caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.’

Scotland Yard said officers were called shortly after 4am following reports of shots being fired in Kilburn High Road, Kilburn, North-West London.

Police and London Ambulance crews found two women suffering from gunshot injuries. Both were taken to hospital and Sabrina was pronounced dead later.

She had been celebrating her birthday  with friends.

Chief Inspector Sandlin said: ‘I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the shooting, or who saw anything suspicious in the Kilburn area early yesterday morning, to call police.

‘In particular, I need to hear from anyone who saw two males who came into the High Road from its junction with Messina Avenue and, after the shooting, made off on foot back along Messina Avenue.’
