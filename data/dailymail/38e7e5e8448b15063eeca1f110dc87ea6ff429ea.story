Growing up, Cheikhou Kouyate always dreamed of following in the footsteps of his idol Patrick Vieira. His journey to London, signing for West Ham for £7million this summer, and development as a player have been so similar to the Arsenal great they could practically have worn the same shoes.

Both were born in Dakar, Senegal, but travelled through Europe to gain their footballing education as teenagers in various countries before ending up in the Barclays Premier League.

Vieira moved to France and then Italy before landing in England at Arsenal. Kouyate’s route was even longer. In pursuit of football he moved first to Greece, leaving his family behind, then to France and finally Belgium before he found East London this summer.

But their similarities stretch further than simple geography. They are both 6ft 4in and of a similar imposing build. Both are known on the football field for their immense physicality and tough tackling. 

t was not long before the comparisons came when Kouyate finally broke into the first-team at Brussels in 2007 aged 18.

‘When I started playing in Belgium I played 10 matches and people began comparing me with Patrick Vieira,’ Kouyate said. ‘It was an immense pleasure to be compared to such a fantastic player because he was a role model for us Senegalese and an inspiration.

‘When he showed how good he was, he made us dream and aspire to achieve similar things. I know it will be tough. Now it is up to me that I deserve the comparison.

‘To do that, I need to give the best to my team. I hope to achieve just a bit of what he achieved. I know it will be difficult. It is now up to me to show my qualities and play like I can.’

It was that ‘obsession,’ as Kouyate describes it, to get to England that drove him on when he felt lonely and homesick and wanted to give it all up. The first three months away from home were the hardest, but it is this experience which, he believes, gives him the mental strength for the English top flight.

‘It was so difficult that I wanted to go back to Senegal,’ he said. ‘It was the first time I had left my country without my family, I had nothing and was completely on my own. It was really cold. It was the first time I had seen snow.

‘But I spoke to my grandmother and my mum on the telephone and they told me to stay put. I was on my own a lot of the time, but I got used to it. It was then my mental strength began to increase, I became tougher.’

Big move: Kouyate moved to Belgium from Senegal and made his debut for Anderlecht at the age of 18 in 2007

His mother and brother are getting loose ends tied up with work in Senegal but plan to move over here. There is talk of December, but they may wait until next summer so the temperature is not such a shock to the system.

Luckily, through his travels, Kouyate is fully prepared for the cold, wet and windy evening and afternoon games ahead. He played with Romeleu Lukaku at Anderlecht, where he signed from this summer, and garnered advice from him. He also spoke to other Senegalese players El Hadji Diouf and Mo Diame. He added: ‘Diouf said I need to work hard, concentrate in training and that I mustn’t hold back.’

When Kouyate takes to the field at Upton Park against Tottenham this afternoon [SAT], provided he does not hold back he will be a step closer to emulating his idol.
