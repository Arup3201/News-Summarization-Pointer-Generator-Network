Ian Poulter weathered one storm but could not hold off another on Friday as he charged to the top of the leaderboard at the Turkish Airlines Open.

The Englishman blew away overnight leader Miguel Angel Jimenez with six birdies and only one dropped shot in 14 holes to take his tally to 13-under-par for the tournament.

But a huge thunder and lightning storm meant the early abandonment of play and forced tournament organisers to contemplate the possibility of a reduced format in the penultimate event of the European Tour season.

With more storms expected on Saturday, there is a race to conclude the second and third rounds in the space of a day, though on current form that is unlikely to disrupt Poulter.

The 39-year-old, who was five under for the day when he was called off, continues to thrive after the equipment change made in the wake of a disappointing Ryder Cup.

His mediocre Cup showing was the latest lowpoint in a year dominated by injuries and poor form, which saw him slide from 12th to 44th in the rankings – leaving him at risk of his lowest year-end ranking since September 2006.

But having finished sixth in China last week, he has used a dusted-off old putter from two years ago to open up a three-shot lead over Brendon de Jonge. His putting has been impressive this week, but his scorching form on the par fives has made the difference, with nine shots gained from the nine long holes he’s played so far.

Poulter, who on Thursday reflected on a ‘****’ season in which ‘there was no good’, said on Friday: ‘I’m playing great and to be on the top of the leaderboard is always nice. It would have been nice to finish the round off but I guess it wasn't meant to be.

‘The weather was perfect for a while until we got onto the 11th green and then things changed quite significantly. The wind switched 180 degrees and really started to blow 20, 30 miles‑an‑hour. It was tricky for probably two holes and then obviously the storm come in pretty quick from there.

‘I’m playing well. It's obviously a great feeling to be on the golf course when you're playing like that, and making birdies is always fun. Right now I'm pretty happy.

‘Saturday is just going to be a longer day, so rest up, get to bed nice and early, come out again.’ 

The slim chance of a player snatching the Race to Dubai crown from Rory McIlroy appears all but gone. Only Welshman Jamie Donaldson, Sergio Garcia or Victor Dubuisson – who had to stuff a tissue up his nose on Friday to stop a persistent nosebleed - are still able to usurp the Northern Irishman but would need to win both here and in Dubai next week while hoping McIlroy fails to finish in the top five in the season-ending event.

However, none of that trio sits inside the top 55 here in Turkey.
