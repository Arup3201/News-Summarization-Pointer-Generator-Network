The deputy leader of a council has been suspended after sending messages to a radio station pretending to be different people – so he could praise his own authority.

Paul Shotton used names including Alison, Jean and Dave as he sent in texts during debates on BBC Radio Stoke backing Stoke-on-Trent City Council and criticising the opposition.

In messages sent in to the breakfast show with Stuart George and Charlotte Foster, the Labour councillor of 11 years also pretended to be from different areas of Stoke-on-Trent including Smallthorne and Fenton.

'Hi, I'm Dave': (aka Paul Shotton)

'Hi, I'm Alison': (aka Paul Shotton)

But after six months, BBC staff eventually became suspicious after they spotted that the messages- around 16 of them - were coming from the same mobile number under names such as Alison, Jean and Dave.

Mr Shotton, who will now face a council standards board hearing, has since admitted sending the texts and apologised ‘fully’ for his actions.

He said: 'I apologise fully for my actions. They were plain stupid. I will never do anything like this again.'

But he has now been suspended by West Midlands Labour Party, which said in a statement: ‘The Labour Party takes these matters very seriously.

'Cllr Paul Shotton has been suspended pending an investigation.’

The cabinet member for economic development and ward councillor for Fenton East is also managing director at Bar O2 Limited, which specialises in supplying firms with Oxygen and associated equipment.

A BBC spokesperson a journalist recognised the phone number and referred the issue to the council.

He added: ‘Audience interaction is an important part of our programmes and we read out texts from our listeners in good faith but we are reliant on the audience being upfront and honest about who they are.’

Mr Shotton was not at a meeting of the council's cabinet held on Thursday night but the council's leader Mohammed Pervez has taken on his cabinet responsibilities.

Mr Pervez, said: 'I was informed of the issue yesterday and immediately contacted the Labour party. The Labour party suspended councillor Shotton pending investigation.'

Gerry Clarke, The Council’s Deputy Monitoring Officer said: 'The Council has been alerted to allegations made against the Deputy Leader of the Council. On the basis of information that has been provided, the Council will initiate a standards board process to enable the facts of this case to be appropriately investigated.

'We understand that an internal investigation is also being undertaken by the Labour Party, and it would therefore be inappropriate for the Council to comment further until such investigations have been concluded.'
