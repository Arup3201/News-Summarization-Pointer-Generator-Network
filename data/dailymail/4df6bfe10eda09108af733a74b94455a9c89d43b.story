An Air Algerie plane has skidded off the tarmac after landing at Paris Orly and forced the closure of one of two runways at the airport.

Runway 26 at Paris’ second-biggest airport was closed and would remain so for several hours until the plane is cleared away after its nose and left main gear sank into a grass verge next to the strip.

A picture posted on Twitter by @ZeuHaKim shows clear skid marks from the plane's tyres after it came to a stop with its front end left stranded on the grass.

It is believed either human error or a technical fault is to blame for Flight AH1004 from Algeria to Paris Orly, which landed at 2.30pm local time today, going off course.

Air traffic tracker Flightradar24 tweeted the path of the plane after it ran off the runway describing Air Algerie's mishap as a 'runway excursion'. 

A spokeswoman for Paris Orly has ruled out any kind of terror attack and said the passengers, none of whom were injured, were safely waiting for their luggage within the terminal an hour later.

But Orly’s Runway 26 will remain closed until the 220-seater Airbus A330-202 can safely  removed.

‘The front of the plane is in the grass’, said the spokeswoman. 

‘It happened after the landing. It will take a few hours to get it out. 

‘We’re down to one runway. 

‘We don’t yet know what caused it to happen. The police will have to make an inquiry’.
