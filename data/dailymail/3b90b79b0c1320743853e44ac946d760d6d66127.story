Families face a high street Easter egg hunt following evidence some supermarket websites have run out of supplies.

The Tesco website carries a red letter warning stating: ‘Sorry this product is currently not available’ on the vast majority of popular big brand eggs.

Similarly, the Morrisons website is listing many top brands as ‘out of stock’, while Asda’s web store also has only a limited range left.

Families face a high street Easter egg hunt following evidence some supermarket websites have run out of supplies 

The Tesco website carries a red letter warning stating: ‘Sorry this product is currently not available’ on the vast majority of popular big brand eggs

Easter eggs listed as unavailable at Tesco include a host under the Cadbury brand, including the Dairy Milk giant egg, Roses, Caramel, Milk Buttons, Oreo, Flake, Twirl, Heroes and Wispa.

Other branded eggs that are apparently sold out include Rolo, Galaxy Indulgent, Kitkat Chunky, Toffee Crisp, Terrys Chocolate Orange and Ferrero Rocher.

The evidence suggests that the supermarkets have miscalculated demand for the eggs, which have been at the centre of a price war give-away as part of a wider battle to tempt shoppers through the door.

Industry research suggests the average price of an Easter Egg is down by 9.7per cent this year following a series of special promotions.

Morrisons triggered the Easter Egg crunch by slashing the price of many medium versions of the big brands, such as Smarties, Rolo and Maltesers to just £1.

Tesco responded by offering Galaxy and Minstrel eggs on sale at a half-price £3 each with more pricey Thornton Premium eggs for sale with £2 off. Asda and Sainsbury’s have been offering their own deals.

Shoppers reported that Tesco stopped selling many big brand Easter eggs on its website before the weekend and more popular products were added to the list by this morning.

All four big brand giant eggs are unavailable, as are six out of eight large eggs and seven out of nine medium eggs. The firm’s website is still offering some more expensive luxury eggs and its own label creations.

Despite the evidence from Tesco’s own website, a spokesman said: ‘We have a fantastic range of Easter eggs available in stores and online, all at great prices and offering some amazing deals for customers.’
