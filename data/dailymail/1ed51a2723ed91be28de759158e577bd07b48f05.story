Businesses that fail to protect their webcams against hackers face being fined for breaching their customers’ privacy.

The crackdown comes after a Mail on Sunday investigation revealed how foreign criminals were hacking into webcams to spy on British offices and shops.

Firms have been warned by data protection watchdog the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Federation of Small Businesses that they could be in breach of the Data Protection Act if they fail to safeguard their cameras with secure passwords.

Education watchdog Ofsted has also warned schools that their cameras must be protected.

In one disturbing example, the ICO found hackers had gained access to a webcam provided by a nursery in the North West of England that enabled parents to monitor their children there. 

The hackers streamed a live feed from the nursery webcam to an Eastern European website.

Tory MP Michael Ellis said: ‘It’s right that business should make sure customers’ data, including that provided by webcams, is protected.’
