A bed and breakfast owner made a cracking discovery - after one of his hens laid what could be the world's smallest egg.

Paul Rae spotted the tiny egg, smaller than a 20p piece, when collecting the eggs for breakfast at his farmhouse in Humshaugh, Northumberland.

The 52-year-old said: 'It was so tiny, about the size of a 20p piece. Because it was with the other eggs, I knew it couldn’t be anything else.

Record breaker? Paul Rae believes one of his hens could have laid the world's smallest egg

'We were in with a chance for having the largest egg for the record books last year and now it’s at the complete other end of the spectrum.'

Dad-of-three, Paul who runs runs Walwick Farm House Bed and Breakfast with his wife Margaret, 54, is not sure which of their four hens, known as ‘Margaret’s Girls,’ laid the unusual egg.

But the couple are hoping that their discovery will be a world first and feature in the Guinness Book of Records.

Earlier this year, Harry Evans found an egg he claimed was barely bigger than a 5p piece at his farm near Bakewell, Derbyshire.

Paul said: 'His weighed 7.3g but mine was just five grams. It’s certainly not longer than 2.5cms which his was, it’s less than that in length.'

Tiny: The mini egg measures just 2.5cm high by 2cm across and weighs only 5g

Mystery: Bed and breakfast owner Paul Rae has no idea which of his hens laid the tiny egg or why

The former catering manager said: 'After I found it I had a quick look online then I took it to the pub. I carried it in my pocket.

'My friends said I should get in touch with the Guinness Book of Records.'

Paul, a trained chef who set up the bed and breakfast last year with his wife of 16 years, said: 'There is no category for the world’s smallest chicken egg as far as I know, so I am going to try and get it recorded.

'I have been a chef all my life, doing catering work around the world and I have never seen anything like that in my life.

'You would need pretty small soldiers for that one.'
