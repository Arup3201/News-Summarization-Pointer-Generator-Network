Manchester United's famous Class of '92 are set to take to the field once again this week - to take on the team some of them own.

Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and the Neville brothers, Gary and Phil, are expected to play a part as the '92 vintage take on Salford City on Thursday at the AJ Bell Stadium.

The quintet bought the club earlier this year and intend to get them from the Evo-Stik League Division One North - the eighth tier - to the Football League

A large crowd is expected at the 
12,000-capacity venue as the United legends team up with other members 
of the side that beat Crystal Palace to win the FA Youth Cup 22 years 
ago.

Robbie Savage, another member of that 
side, laid down the gauntlet on Twitter, writing: '@salfordcityfc 
looking forward to smashing into one or two of you on Thursday night 
haha !'

Speaking when the 
friendly was announced back in May, the Class of '92 stars said in a 
statement: 'We are really looking forward to the match, it will 
certainly be competitive.

'It
 will be good to play with each other again, it's been a long time but 
more importantly we will want to give Salford City a tough game.'

Ambition: The Class of '92 intend to take Salford from the eighth tier to the Football League
