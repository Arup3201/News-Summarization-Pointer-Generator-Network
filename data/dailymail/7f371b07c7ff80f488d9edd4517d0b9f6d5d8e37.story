With the exception of the adventurous few, indulging in a passion for pink, lacy lingerie has been the preserve of women. Until now.

One fashion firm hopes to change the way we shop for underwear with the launch of a range of racy lingerie exclusively for men.

The HommeMystere collection, which includes padded bras, lacy teddies and frilly thongs with names like Jungle Fever, Moulin Rouge and Forget-me-not, is said by the firm to be 'comfortable' and 'great for all day wear'.

They specialise in, they say, 'comfortable
 men's panties that really do
 fit, bra straps that don't fall off the shoulder, teddies that don't 
ride up halfway through the night and quality soft fabrics that feel 
great for all day wear'.

The Fun Teddy sleepsuit is a 'lovely soft fabric teddy for men' and a 'full cut that stays in place' priced £35.70

The Australian label - which has distributors in the UK and U.S. - say attractive undergarments feel great and make dressing more fun and enjoyable for men.

They say they understand that men want 'quality lingerie style underwear made with care, attention to detail' that fits your body perfectly'.

The brand itself not new but has gained a recent surge of publicity thanks to a video of its recent runway show at the International Fashion Show in Las Vegas which took place this month.

The video features an array of pouting men modelling the range, strutting up and down the catwalk clenching their buttocks, doing body rolls and posing.

While cross-dressing is not specific to sexual preferences, HommeMystere's advertising images are of men and women posing as a couple.

In their FAQ section they address this, saying they cater to all customers - whether straight or gay.

'We provide our lingerie for guys,' 
they say. 'We are not concerned if you are gay, straight, vegetarian, 
republican, anglican, martian or any other persuasion. 

'We just design and manufacture attractive luxury underwear for men.'

They ship to anywhere in the world for $5.00, and 'always respect your privacy by being as discreet as possible'.
