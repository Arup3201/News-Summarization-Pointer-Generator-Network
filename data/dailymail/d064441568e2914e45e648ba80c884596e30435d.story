Call off the search, close the polls, the votes have been cast and the winner of this year's most shamelessly adorable commercial has been decided.

Featuring 30 snuggletastic fluffy bunnies, a magical online advert for hotel giant Ibis has been named the cutest of the year by marketing magazine Adweek. And they might just be right.

To the dulcet tones of Richard Hawley singing Hushabye Mountain, the downy, lop-eared darlings flop about a London hotel room, all twitchy noses, stubby tails and teeny tiny yawns, weaving in and out of soft pillows and silk pyjamas and eventually huddling together in the centre of the bed to take a nice, long, cosy nap - some so sleepy they just drop with their little legs up in the air.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The star of the cutest advert of the year is this fluffy grey bunny, who flops on his back at the end of the commercial and falls asleep with his legs aloft

And as the video of the world's cutest sleepover steadily climbs the YouTube ranks - with over 70,000 hits in its first two days just - pet shops should probably prepare for a markedly steep rise in the number of enquiries into bunny rabbit purchases.

Ibis, the largest hotel chain in Europe and part of Accor, launched the online film - entitled simply Snuggling Bunnies - to promote the brand's soft new Sweet Bed.

The film was devised by creative agency BETC London and shot by Independent Films on location over two days in a top floor room at the the ibis London Blackfriars

It captures the bunnies as they seek out the comest place to sleep... and decide on the bed.

Naming it 'this year's most shamelessly adorable commercial', Tim Nudd from Adweek said: 'Cats get most of the Internet love, but bunnies can put on quite a show of devastating cuteness as well -as displayed in this new spot from BETC London for Ibis Hotels.'

Neil Dawson, executive creative director, BETC London, said: 'We really wanted to highlight the ultimate comfort of the Sweet Bed by ibis.

'Bunnies snuggle up to each other and find cosy places to sleep. And what better evidence of the ultimate comfort of the bed than for the bunnies to seek out and sleep there on their own.'

Director Ornette Spenceley of Independent Films captures the bunnies' adventure through the soft, diffused lighting and framed visuals the cinematography brings the scene to life as a visually outstanding film.

The lullaby soundtrack is a contemporary remake of Hushabye Mountain from childhood film favourite Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, originally sung by Dick Van Dyke and here performed by Richard Hawley.

No bunnies were harmed during the making of this super-cute commercial... but many of them did fall asleep

Karelle Lamouche, VP Marketing ibis Brands Northern Europe said: 'The video is a light-hearted way of emphasising the essential part of the ibis brand - the uniquely designed bed - and reminds people that ibis places a happy sleep at the centre of its offering.'

Ibis' new beds - which are at the heart of the ibis megabrand campaign - have been rigorously engineered and include high-tech mattresses, a luxury mattress topper and an engineered box spring bed.

Well, who is THIS rather dashing young chap?
