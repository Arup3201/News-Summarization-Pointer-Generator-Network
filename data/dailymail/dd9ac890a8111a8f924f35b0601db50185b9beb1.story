When BBC bosses relocated from London to Salford, critics warned that the corporation’s flagship morning news show would struggle to attract high-profile guests.

Now it appears those sceptical about the 200-mile move north might have been right – as it emerged yesterday that filming of BBC Breakfast’s ‘light news’ slot could be returned to the capital.

Preliminary discussions have been held at the Corporation about whether to turn the latter segment of the BBC One show into a separate programme – possibly called Breakfast Extra – which could be based in the South.

Insiders suggest there are concerns the section of the show between 8.30am and 9.15am – described as ‘the bridge’, after its transition from morning news into daytime schedules – is not working well enough.

Among the concerns about the segment, which features celebrity interviews, are that its live guests are not of a high enough calibre.

It was revealed in July that the show, hosted by Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid, was forced to conduct 12 interviews via video link in one week because guests were based in London.

Among the ideas – said to be at an early stage – is to create an entirely separate show, which one executive suggested could be called Breakfast Extra.

This would be similar to ITV’s Daybreak in which Lorraine Kelly has her own separate show after the news-based section has finished.

Another option is to turn the last 45 minutes into a studio debate, or to dump this part of the programme altogether and ‘stick to more news’. Supporters of this point out that at the moment the BBC News channel stops taking footage from BBC Breakfast at 8.30am, when it could run through to 9.15am.

A senior BBC insider said: ‘There has been a bit of discussion about what to do after 8.30am. One of the suggestions is a completely different programme for it – a Breakfast Extra. There are options. Should it be a separate programme, or not? And at what cost?’

However, many believe the BBC will ultimately decide against returning the 45-minute slot to London, because it will look like ‘an admission of failure’, another well-placed source at the broadcaster said.

They added: ‘I would be surprised if they move [part of it back to London]. It does not look good after such a short amount of time of it being up there.

‘It is a crucial part of the schedule so it’s important it works. The celebs are not brilliant and it doesn’t feel quite right.’

A BBC Breakfast spokesman said: ‘There are no plans to move any part of BBC Breakfast back to London. On the contrary, the show is working very well from Salford and we’re delighted with the calibre of guests and experts regularly appearing.’
