Wasps fans have been told to accept the reality of professional sport following the watershed purchase of Coventry’s Ricoh Arena in a move which paves the way for NFL-style franchises in rugby union.

The two-time European champions, who came close to going bankrupt two years ago, on Wednesday confirmed they will play their first match at their new ground in December after Coventry City Council agreed to sell them a 50 per cent share in the ground in a deal which could end up being worth almost £19million.

The decision to relocate the former north London club from their current High Wycombe home — where they have played home games for the past 12 years — has incensed supporters, and there is also unease among rival clubs in their new territory, including Worcester, Leicester and Northampton.

Some Wasps fans have indicated they intend to protest at Sunday’s Aviva Premiership clash with Bath at Adams Park, and Northampton boss Jim Mallinder sympathised with them on Wednesday.

‘I feel sorry for the loyal, local Wasps fans,’ Mallinder said. ‘If Northampton Saints decided to move there would be a bit of an uproar.’

The move was welcomed by Wasps captain James Haskell, whom Sportsmail understands received a ‘slap on the wrist’ for tweeting a picture of his new Range Rover on Tuesday ahead of the club’s announcement of a new sponsorship deal with the Coventry-based car manufacturers.

‘I know people will be sceptical about change but this club have been just an hour away from bankruptcy in recent years,’ Haskell said. ‘We have losses of £3m a year and there was no other option but to look for a new stadium.

‘I know this will be difficult to explain to a young Wasps fan but Coventry isn’t a million miles away.’

Doubts remain over contractual issues facing players who signed deals to play in London but prop Matt Mullan insisted: ‘As players we’ve put our trust in people at the club that they are making the right decision for the club’.
