High street banks are using Wonga-style bullying letters to chase customers for payments.

Barclays, Lloyds, Halifax, RBS and HSBC are among firms who have sent customers letters that look like they are from outside firms when they are not.

The letters appear to be designed to put pressure on customers by making them believe requests for debt repayments have been passed on to third parties.

Barclays confirmed it has been using the name Mercers Debt Collection for Barclaycard debts but it said it dropped the pretence of using a different name earlier this year and the change came into effect this week

Energy giant Scottish Power and Anglian Water, which supplies families in the East of England, are also using the letters.

A major row erupted last week when it was revealed that payday loan giant Wonga had made up the names of two firms to harass people who were behind on loan repayments.

The firm was ordered by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to pay £2.6million in compensation to the 45,000 people affected.

The City of London police are investigating whether Wonga has broken one of several laws, ranging from the Theft Act to the Administration of Justice Act, which covers the harassment of debtors.

It later emerged the Student Loan Company was using the same tactic to chase graduates for their student loans, and it can now be revealed that the threatening tactics go well beyond the ‘legal loan sharks’ such as Wonga, with a string of household names using the controversial ploy.

Barclays has been using the name Mercers Debt Collections, while Lloyds, which is part-owned by the taxpayer, has used Sechiari, Clarke and Mitchell Solicitors, which is actually its in-house legal department. Its subsidiary, Halifax Bank of Scotland, has used the name Blair, Oliver & Scott to chase debts.

Anglian Water created a brand called Frontier Debt Collections to pressure people into paying up.

One customer targeted in 2010 said: ‘I felt angry and deceived by Anglian Water when I discovered that it was actually them and not a debt collector.

‘I was appalled at the lies they were prepared to tell to deceive me and try to add immense worry to an already stressful situation.’

MPs and consumer groups last night said it was ‘dishonest’ for banks and utility firms to be ‘distressing and intimidating’ their customers.

Consumer Action Group founder Marc Gander said: ‘These are dishonest tactics, however they are widely used, even by so-called reputable companies.

‘This is not just about Wonga. All the companies that employ these tactics, whether it is the Student Loans Company, the banks or utility companies, should face equal scrutiny and equal sanctions.

‘Action needs to be taken.’

Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy added: ‘It is dishonest of lenders to disguise letters chasing people for money as being from third parties.

'People who are heavily in debt are under immense financial strain and need to know where to go for help, not be harassed by bogus companies exerting undue pressure and in some cases charging them for it.’

All the companies identified by the Daily Mail insist that while they have used third-party names, any letters sent to consumers made clear who they were owned by.

Barclays confirmed it has been using the name Mercers Debt Collection for Barclaycard debts.

But it said it dropped the pretence of using a different name earlier this year and the change came into effect this week.

Lloyds Bank confirmed it has been using the name Sechiari, Clarke and Mitchell Solicitors as a pseudonym for its in-house legal department since at least 2011, but has decided to phase the name out.

tactics should face equal scrutiny and equal sanctions'

Scottish Power created the name Sterling Collections.

The company said: ‘Sterling Collections is a part of Scottish Power’s debt recovery process. All customer communications referencing Sterling Collections clearly state “Sterling Collections is a trading name of Scottish Power Energy Retail Ltd”.’

Last night, Labour MP Stella Creasy said: ‘These letters seem to have been designed to frighten people into thinking that they are further along in the debt process than they are.

'At best, they are not being transparent, and at the worst they are being downright deceptive. It’s disgraceful.’

The Solicitors Regulatory Authority said it was looking into several complaints about the tactic.

The watchdog’s executive director, Richard Collins, told the Law Society Gazette: ‘We will shortly be issuing guidance for in-house solicitors on our existing requirement that publicity must not be misleading.’
