Drones have been banned from parks near Buckingham Palace and other senior Royals’ homes amid fears they could be used by spies or would-be terrorists.

The remote-controlled aircraft cannot be used in any of the open spaces near the Queen’s London residence. 

Signs have gone up in every Royal park across the capital warning: ‘The flying of drones or model aircraft in the park is prohibited.’

Their proximity to historic buildings, including Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, has prompted speculation that the gadgets pose a risk to the Royal Family’s security. 

But a Royal Parks spokesman insisted the signs could also be found far away from palaces, including Richmond Park and Greenwich Park.

He said: ‘They can have a very negative impact on the wildlife in the parks and interfere with the safety and comfort of park visitors.’

Insiders say there have already been ‘a handful of incidents’ involving drones inside London’s biggest parks. 

Just before Christmas a man was given a warning after flying a drone over the Winter Wonderland fairground inside Hyde Park, while videos posted online show tourists flying drones, most of which carry high-definition cameras, close to landmarks including Buckingham Palace.

Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed that the Metropolitan Police – who are responsible for security in the Royal Parks – want the power to seize unmanned aircraft being flown illegally. 

Drones are already banned from the parks, under existing legislation that prohibits the use of ‘any kite or model aircraft’. 

Under aviation law, it is also illegal to fly them within 50m (164ft) of a building or person.
