Apple has been accused of resorting to technological trickery in an effort to obscure their 'apology' to Samsung after losing the latest round of their ongoing tablet legal battle.

Visitors to the Apple UK website homepage have to scroll down to see the statement after an apparent quirk of the new JavaScript code pushes the mea culpa out of sight.

The re-sized code seems not to affect the U.S. version of the technology giants website and only appears on the UK one, which has led to users on websites such as Reddit to smell sour grapes from Apple.

Visitors to the Apple website in the UK could not obviously see the link to read Apple's statement regarding Samsung today

According to tech experts, the piece of code that Apple used ensures that an advert for the iPad mini takes up the whole page - pushing the apology out of sight.

One software developer who has spoken to CNET, explained that the new JavaScript forces the central image on the website to take up a larger amount of space on the page, showing the new iPad Mini, but not a link to the statement.

This is significant because on October 18, UK High Court Judge Colin Birss ordered Apple to post a message on its British website for one month stating that Samsung did not infringe any of Apple's patents in the production of their Galaxy Tab and did not break any laws.

However, Samsung complained to the UK Court of Appeal that Apple's statement posted on October 25 was inaccurate and it was ultimately deemed to be 'non-compliant' with the original order made earlier this month.

It made reference to their victories against Samsung outside the UK, and as such the original release upset the South Korean technology company.

'A U.S. jury also found Samsung guilty of infringing on Apple’s design and utility patents, awarding over one billion U.S. dollars in damages to Apple Inc,' read the original statement.

'So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, Samsung willfully copied Apple’s far more popular iPad.'

Furthermore this was placed not on the front page but tucked away accessible only through at least two links and the appeal court demanded that Apple change this on Thursday and gave them 48 hours to do so.

The judges, Lord Justice Longmore, Lord Justice Kitchin and Sir Robin Jacob called the statement 'untrue' and 'incorrect' and Apple did eventually remove it.

However, it was only today that technology experts noticed the new 'apology' and its lack of visibility.

'On 25 October 2012, Apple Inc. published a statement on its UK website in relation to Samsung’s Galaxy tablet computers,' said the new 'hidden' posting.

'That statement was inaccurate and did not comply with the order of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. The correct statement is at Samsung/Apple UK judgement.'

It is unclear whether the re-sized code was a deliberate attempt to conceal their statement or if it is simply because Apple are innocently trying fit as many images onto the page as possible.

But regardless, this is just the latest installment in the spat between the Californian and South Korean companies which began back in 2010.

The original notice posted on Apple's website, which a court said on Thursday did not comply with its orders

Apple have accused Samsung of copying patents and designs for their respective smartphones and tablets and have opened lawsuits in countries across the world.

In the UK lawsuit, Apple contended that Samsung had used their European 'registered design' for the iPad tabler - but Judge Birss disagreed and found against Apple in July.

Samsung said that the original statement from Apple contained potentially confusing references to German and U.S. court decisions as well as the British ruling, was 'inaccurate and misleading'.

statement on its website after a court decided its first version did not
comply.

Judges agreed and said Apple must post the new statement within the next 48 hours, although the U.S. company said it would need two weeks to post the notice.

Judge Robin Jacob told Apple's lawyer, Michael Beloff, he did not believe that it would be difficult to post a new statement on the website.

'I would like to see the head of Apple make an affidavit about why that is such a technical difficulty for the Apple company,' the Press Association quoted Jacob as saying. 'This is Apple that cannot put something on their own website?'

Apple declined to comment on the ruling until they posted the new statement today.
