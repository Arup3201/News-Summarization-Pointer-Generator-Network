Newcastle have appealed against Fabricio Coloccini’s red card during Sunday’s 3-0 defeat at Everton in the hope of having their captain available for the Tyne-Wear derby.

The defender was sent off following a lunge on Aaron Lennon in the second half and immediately hit with a three-game ban, ruling him out of the trip to the Stadium of Light on Easter Sunday.

Newcastle are to appeal Fabricio Coloccini's red card he picked up during defeat against Everton

Coloccini was sent off for a challenge on Everton's Aaron Lennon

But United feel they have a case for overturning the dismissal and their appeal will be heard on Tuesday.

Were it to fail, they would have just one fit centre-back – Mike Williamson – for the games against Arsenal, Sunderland and Liverpool.
