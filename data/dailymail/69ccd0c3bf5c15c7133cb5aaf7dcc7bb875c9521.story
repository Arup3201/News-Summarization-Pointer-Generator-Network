Tokyo has more than 100 cat cafés serving cakes and coffee, 
filled with free-roaming felines for customers to play 
with. Since the success of these establishments, bunny cafés have followed.

And the trend for coffee shops which double up as petting zoos shows no signs of slowing.

Now, the first ever owl café has opened in the Tsukishima region of the Japanese capital.

Animal cafés are so successful in the Far East country because pets are often forbidden in apartments.

Dubbed the Fukuro no Mise, or the Owl Store, the establishment opened recently in Tsukishima, Tokyo.

The coffee shop's birds are tethered to plastic and wire trays and can be petted and held by customers. 

It has attracted much local media attention, and popular website Rocket News 24 paid them a visit and reported back on what they found.

Reporters said the shopfront windows had their curtains closed, so no outside light can filter in - and no pedestrians can stop to look either.

Owl enthusiasts queued outside to wait for a time slot to pet the birds and drink coffee.

The café doesn’t have a booking system so customers must come on the day hope there will be an opening.

'Once you’re let inside the cafe, the first thing they have you do is settle into a seat and choose a drink,' writes Preston Phro.

'The menu is pretty simple: You can choose from iced, hot, or alcoholic drinks like coffee, tea, and beer.

'Since there’s no cover charge, you have to buy at least one drink – which will cost you 1,000 yen [£6.30] for non-alcoholic drinks or 1,200 [£7.50] yen for alcoholic drinks. While this might seem expensive, it also gets you one hour with the owls.'

Phro explains that the café has strict rules governing contact with the birds.

'It’s nothing too extreme, but some of the owls can’t be held and others cannot be touched at all.

'Also, while photos are completely fine, you’re not allow to use your flash or take videos.

'Finally, when holding an owl, or, rather, when an owl is perched on you, you have to hold the tether tightly.'

He goes on to say that though the birds are quite mellow, if they get spooked or irritated, they’ll try to fly away. So by hanging onto the tether, you can prevent them from smacking into a wall or getting attacked by another owl.

Furthermore, customers are warned that there might be issues with owl droppings.

With the introduction finished, writers were allowed to handle the owls.

'When petting the owls, there are two things you have to careful of. The first is to pet softly, from front to back. You need to go with the feathers; going against the feathers can hurt the birds,' writes Phro.

'The other thing is just being aware that they might try to nibble your hand. This is how they communicate, so unless it really hurts, just continue petting. If you start and stop too much, it will annoy the owls.

RSPCA warns wild animals and have specialist needs which are hard to cater for in a captive environment

Some of the owls were off-limits to customers for various 
reasons. One was born blind, so couldn’t be petted for fear of 
surprising him, and there were two owls that were just too 
tired.

MailOnline contacted the RSPCA for their opinion on the owls' welfare. They responded with the following comment.

'We would have serious concerns for the welfare of wild animals kept in captivity in this way in the UK,' said senior RSPCA wildlife scientist Dr Ros Clubb.

'Owls
are beautiful animals which appeal to many people but they do not make 
good pets and are not suitable to be used in this way. They are wild 
animals and have specialist needs which are hard to cater for in a 
captive environment.

'Owls
are by nature generally shy and reclusive birds, preferring to spend 
most of their time roosting in a secluded place, and most species are 
nocturnal. They also have sharp talons and strong feet that can inflict 
deep puncture wounds and scratches.

'Owls need very large aviary with a sheltered roosting area and a specialist diet.

'The conditions shown in the pictures are totally unsuitable.'
