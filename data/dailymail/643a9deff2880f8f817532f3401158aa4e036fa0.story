A teenage girl who murdered her 'best friend' along with a female classmate kept up a disturbingly normal social media presence in the months before she confessed to the brutal killing.

Rachel Shoaf, along with her friend 
Sheila Eddy, lured 16-year-old Skylar Neese out of her house in July 
2012, before stabbing her to death and hiding her body in a Pennsylvania
 wood.

It was six months before Shoaf and Eddy confessed to the killings - and remained active on social media through the frantic search for their friend. On July 7, 2012, just a day after she and Shoaf killed Miss Neese, Eddy tweeted a 'happy birthday' message to a friend.

Eddy kept up a steady stream of tweets about watching Law And Order on TV, doing homework and going to parties, according to a new episode of ABC's 20/20 to be aired on Friday.

She also tweeted about how close her friendship was with Shoaf, writing: 'no one on this earth can handle me and rachel is you think you can you're wrong.'

Shoaf finally cracked on January 3, 2013 and confessed to investigators what had happened and where
 to find their friend's body.

Eddy and Shoaf 
lured Skylar out of her ground-floor bedroom in Star City and drove her 
to a secluded spot near the unincorporated West Virginia community of 
Macdale. The girls then stabbed her to death at an agreed-upon moment.

Authorities
 said the girls covered the body of the University High honors student 
with branches when they couldn't bury her, and left it in a wooded area 
across the Pennsylvania border for months.

Eddy tweeted this message shortly before her arrest for the murder of Skylar Neese. Fellow murderer Rachel Shoaf had already admitted to police that the girl's decided to count to three and then stab the 16-year-old

Days after Rachel Shoaf admitted to killing her friend Skylar Neese along with Eddy, the latter was back on Twitter posting messages about TV

However a few days later, Eddy was back on Twitter, posting messages about watching her favorite TV shows.

In March, authorities announced that the remains found belonged to Skylar Neese. Even then, Eddy was still keeping up the act.

She posted a picture montage of the girls together with the message: 'Rest easy Skylar, youâ€™ll ALWAYS be my best friend.'

She then tweeted that it was the 'worst day of my whole life'.

Shoaf and Eddy plotted Neese's murder at school, Shoaf admitted during her confession in January 2013. They planned to pick up Neese at her home then stab her to death in the woods, after counting to three.

On March 30, 2013, before she was arrested for murder, Eddy tweeted: 'We really did go on three.'

Eddy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced in January to life as part of a plea agreement that makes her eligible for parole after 15 years.

Shoaf, 17, pleaded guilty last May to second-degree murder in the July 2012 slaying. She'll be eligible for parole after 10 years.

Rachel Shoaf pleaded guilty to murdering her friend Skylar Neese in July 2012 for no apparent reason other than she didn't want to be friends with her anymore. She was sentenced to 30 years in March (pictured)

At her sentencing, Shoaf asked the court for forgiveness just before she was handed 30 years in state prison.

She also made a chilling admission that they'd done it 'because they didn't want to be friends with Skylar anymore'.

Eddy refused to address the court 
other than to say guilty. The victim's father, Dave Neese, later said he
 found her silence 'unacceptable'.

Her lawyer said it wasn't a signal of any lack of remorse.

Speaking
 at Eddy's sentencing, Skylar's family revealed how their daughter's 
friend had comforted them and joined in their grief to try and cover her
 tracks.

Skylar's aunt
 Carol Michaud said: 'She came and acted as if she knew nothing. She 
pretended and stayed with us and comforted us and swore she had no idea 
what was going.To come to this day and admit she did just shows how evil
 she can be.'
