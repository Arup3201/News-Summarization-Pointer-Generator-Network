Royal dentist Sir Nicholas Sturridge, whose son Dominic has been stymied by Home Office officials who have refused to give his wife UK residency

As the son of the Queen’s Harley Street dentist, Dominic Sturridge had every reason to believe that returning to Britain with his new bride after six years abroad would be a formality.

But Dominic, whose father Sir Nicholas Sturridge received his knighthood after 32 years as surgeon dentist to the Royal Household, faces heartache after Home Office officials refused to grant his young Thai wife residency.

‘We are a perfectly legitimate couple and really didn’t expect all this trouble,’ says Dominic, 44.

‘My troubles started when I returned from Thailand where I’ve been working with major property dealers for six years. I met Eed there and fell in love.’

Speaking at a Chelsea cocktail party, Dominic — a cousin of actor Tom Sturridge, the beau of film star Sienna Miller — tells me: ‘Eed and I got married in Bangkok but neither of our parents came.

‘I suppose my father had more conventional lifestyle hopes for me, as we come from five generations of medics and he looked after the Queen Mother’s teeth as well.

‘Even though Dad didn’t really understand my relationship with Eed, he turned up at Heathrow to greet us with a bottle of champagne when we came to England.

‘This is no bought Thai bride situation. I love her deeply.’

While Dominic is continuing to work in property in London, Eed, 24, has found work, too. ‘She is not living off me and has got a job at a Covent Garden cocktail bar and I’m proud of her,’ he says.

According to Sturridge, the Home Office has rejected her request to settle here. 

‘It has got very strict and said we didn’t have joint bank accounts or a joint electricity bill.

‘I’m sure my father was shocked when this all happened, but he has been brilliant and when it’s sorted out I’m thinking of having a traditional English wedding or blessing, too, so he can be there and share our happiness.

‘I just hope this doesn’t drag on for too long.’

The Home Office says it has strict entry requirements for foreign spouses of British subjects.

‘These range from financial stipulations to showing the couple have actually met and proving the relationship is genuine and subsisting,’ says a spokesman.

Romantic novelist Santa Montefiore, pictured right, has had her dramas over the years — not least when she called the fire brigade and declared: ‘My name is Santa and my chimney is on fire.’

But friends of the best-selling author were a little alarmed to receive an email begging for money because she and her family had been ‘mugged in an alley by a gang of thugs’ in Naples. It said she needed £1,600 for hotel bills.

Santa, a skiing pal of the Prince of Wales, was indeed embarrassed — not through a lack of funds but because the email  was bogus. And, in fact, she had become  the latest celebrity victim of a pernicious internet scam.

‘I was inundated all morning about it,’ mother-of-two Santa, 43, tells me from Belgium, where she is  on a book tour.

‘It’s happened to me about three times in the past, so I think by now all my friends are smart enough to realise that the messages are just spam.’

Other victims have included TV presenter Claudia Winkleman, veteran newsreader Sandy Gall — who was said to have been taken prisoner — and opera impresario and restaurateur Christopher Gilmour, who was said to have been robbed on holiday in Spain.

Adds Santa: ‘I’ve changed my password now. As long as no one sends any money to the hackers then we’re all OK.’

Hollywood heart-throb Leonardo DiCaprio could find himself upstaged at the Cannes Film Festival tonight by the arrival at the premier of his Great Gatsby movie of a chauffeur-driven dancing dog.

Britain’s Got Talent  star  Pudsey will watch DiCaprio’s red carpet arrival as he prepares for his own photocall to launch Pudsey: The Movie.

He and owner Ashleigh Butler drove to the South of France from Northamptonshire in agent Jonathan Shalit’s limo.

‘Pudsey went on Simon Cowell’s private jet to the U.S. to appear on TV, so his own limo is nothing less than he is accustomed to,’ says Shalit.

Angelina Jolie had been anticipating the day she would undergo a double mastectomy all her adult life.

After her mother Marcheline Bertrand was diagnosed with cancer — which has claimed the lives of all the maternal side of the family — Angie wrote a prescient script  about the Bertrand curse.

According to Andrew Morton’s 2010 biography, Jolie’s first script, Skin, written  in 1999, was about a girl  with a terminally-ill mother and a family history of cancer who discovers she has the disease in one breast but decides to have both removed.‘It was very hardcore,’ says a friend who read the script.

Serious: Richard de la Poer and Flora Richardson

The last time the Earl of Tyrone’s polo-playing son Richard de la Poer broke a bone he had the Marquess of Milford Haven’s pretty daughter, Tatiana Mountbatten, to soothe his agony.

But while his collarbone has healed, that youthful relationship has long since bitten the dust.

Now Richard, 25, who bears the courtesy title Baron La Poer, has a new woman in his life even more ideally placed should he suffer another injury in the saddle.

For his latest love is glamorous hospital doctor Flora Richardson, 26, whose brothers Jack and Ralf are polo players. All of which,  she says, means she is brilliant at first aid.

‘We’re in love and Flora is just about to move in with me,  so it’s very serious,’ says Richard at the polo season launch party  at PJ’s in Chelsea.

‘Polo can be risky so it’s an added bonus that Flora is a medical lady who appreciates the game.’

Adds St Mary’s Ascot–educated Flora: ‘They have very good first aiders on duty anyway, but it does help I’m not the squeamish type!’

With his plans for a reunion tour with the Boomtown Rats in disarray after gigs Down Under were cancelled because of poor ticket sales, Sir Bob Geldof has one thing to celebrate.

He has just been immortalised in oils by artist Mitch Griffiths, but with one bizarre twist — the grizzled rocker is depicted covered in rats.

Griffiths has also painted actor Ray Winstone and it was the movie hardman’s daughter Lois, a friend of Bob’s daughter Fifi Trixibelle, who persuaded him to pose. But famously foul-mouthed Geldof, 61, had no idea about the rodents.

Griffiths says: ‘I wanted to use the rats as a symbol of degradation and poverty so I contacted a rat breeder. I then had a body double pose up and just poured 20 rats all over him.’

The rats came as a ‘complete surprise’ to Bob when he saw the painting but, adds Mitch: ‘His response, though colourful, was thoroughly positive.’
