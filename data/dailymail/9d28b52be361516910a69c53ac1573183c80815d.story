A rapper known as 'Big Paybacc' was shot and killed inside a Mcdonald's in California on Thursday as he sat and ate a meal in the fast food restaurant.

The 38-year-old whose real name is Habeeb Ameer Zekajj, was reportedly eating lunch in the restaurant in Palmdale, when someone came into the restaurant and shot him once.

Sheriff’s homicide detectives responded just before 12:30 pm to the restaurant in the 37200 block of 47th Street East, officials said.

Death: The 38-year-old was reportedly eating lunch in this Mcdonalds in Palmdale, when he was shot and killed

But he was pronounced dead at the scene.

According to eyewitnesses,  there were about 15 people  inside the restaurant at the time of the murder.

LA County Sheriff’s Department Lt. John Corina told reporters: 'There was no altercation. This guy just walked in through one door, shot him and left out another door. 

'So it looked like something personal. He had something against this individual. It wasn’t like he shot up the McDonald’s. He just shot him and left.'

Meanwhile, his distraught girlfriend Jessica Jefferson said Zekajj has left behind three children.

She tearfully told CBS2: 'I just knew it. I drove by and saw his truck.'

'I had just seen him. He left my house to come here.

Body: Workers from LA county coroner's office remove his body from the scene after the fatal shooting

Grief: His distraught girlfriend Jessica Jefferson, pictured here, said Zekajj has left behind three children.

Investigation: LA County Sheriff’s Department Lt. John Corina told reporters: 'There was no altercation.'

She said he was a well-liked person and the killer was very bold to shoot him in broad daylight, in front of all of the people in the restaurant.

She added: 'For them to be that bold to run up to someone in a McDonald’s in daylight, in front of people, kids you know, and to just take some kind of vengeance on somebody, it’s, it’s inhumane.'

And despite his image as a tough gangster rapper she wants people to know he was a really nice person.

'Everybody loves him,' she said, 'everybody loves him, and he’s a good rapper, and he has so many followers, and people who stand behind him. He really is a good, solid person.'
