A 23-year-old American girl nearly won a Middle Eastern talent competition.

Jennifer Grout, 23, from Cambridge, Massachusetts placed third in Arabs Got Talent on Saturday, ultimately losing out to Syrian dance troupe Sima.

'I'm really happy I was in the top three and it was such a good experience, but I'm so happy for Sima because they deserved it,' Grout told CNN.

Grout became a favorite to win the competition early on, with her performances of classic Arabic songs.

While some questioned whether an American who can barely speak Arabic should be allowed to compete in a Middle Eastern talent competition, there was still overwhelming support for Grout - especially amongst the judges.

'You don't speak a word of Arabic, yet you sing better than some Arab singers,' said judge Najwa Karam, a popular Lebanese singer. 'We have for so long imitated the West, and this is the first time that a person who has no link whatsoever to the Arab world, an American girl who does not speak Arabic, sings Arabic songs.'

Karam said Grout's third-place achievement is something that's made her 'very happy'.

'It shows music is universal. When it comes to the arts, there are no barriers between us and any other people in the world.'

Foreign singers have always learned English to conquer the pop market - but it rarely works the other way round.

Swedish 1970s pop icons ABBA launched their career in English instead of their mother tongue to win over more foreign fans.

Colombian diva Shakira (above) had a huge audience in Latin America but hit the big time when she released her fifth album Laundry Service in English in 2001.

Spanish-American crooner Enrique Iglesias was born in Madrid but sang his hit single Hero in English, earning himself global fame.

Puerto Rican singer Enrique Martín Morales had limited success in a boy band - until he adopted the stage name Ricky Martin for his hit Livin' La Vida Loca (the crazy life).

Iceland's postmodern darling Bjork sings in English, earning her an eclectic audience all over the world.

And radio stations in France have even tried to stop singers deserting their mother tongue - by dictating that at least 40 per cent of playlists must be in French

Jennifer - from Cambridge, Massachusetts - is the daughter of a pianist and a violinist and started studying music at the age of 5. She says her ethnic background is English, Scottish and Native American.

She was studying opera at McGill University in Montreal when she first discovered Arab music.

In 2010 she found a video by the Lebanese singer Fairouz and got hooked on Arabic music, buying a traditional lute-like instrument called an oud.

'I've been working on it and practicing a lot and I listen to it all the time,' she told the show. 'I get a translation or I have one of my Arab friends do a translation for me.

'It was a little bit strange for my family in the beginning, but now they totally support what I do.'

She asked for a one-way ticket to Morocco for her college graduation gift and she has been living there since last year.

For a brief period, Grout moved to Paris to busk on subways.

'I would step onto the train and hold out my hat and start singing Arabic music,' she told the New York Times. 'Some days I made decent money, other days hardly anything. But, eventually, I figured out which train lines had the most Arabs on them. Once a man on the train shouted at everyone to be quiet so that he could listen to me.'

She won over the audience on the talent show by singing Baeed Anak (Away From You) by Umm Kulthum, one of the most celebrated singers in Egypt's history.

She also sings in the Berber dialects of traditional communities in Algeria, Morocco, Lybia, Mali, Niger and Tunisia.

She told Good Morning America: 'About 30 seconds into it, I think everybody was very surprised. I felt really proud, because the audience went from not taking me seriously to like, wow she's good.'
