A Maryland woman drove her car into a lake Tuesday while texting.

The 25-year-old woman told police that her car ended up in the Waldorf, MD., lake just before 12:30pm Tuesday because she was texting.

Preoccupied with tapping away on her phone, the unidentified woman drove off the roadway into a tree and then 60 feet down an embankment into the lake, officials said.

The car was submerged in five feet of water, but the woman climbed out and swam to safety by the time police arrived.

The driver was taken to a local hospital, her white Hyundai was pulled from the lake. She sustained minor injuries, said police.

An investigation is ongoing and charges are pending, a Charles County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson told MailOnline, but would not speculate as to which charges the woman may face.

‘Texting and driving is against the law, but [won’t comment] which charges she's looking at,’ the spokesperson added.
