Cuban authorities are scrambling to contain a cholera outbreak that has infected dozens of people in Havana, the capital city of 2.2 million residents and a popular tourism destination.

The Health Ministry said the outbreak was first detected on January 6 and was being contained.

'Fifty-one cases have been confirmed to date,' the statement read, without mentioning fatalities.

Outbreak: Cuban authorities are scrambling to contain a cholera outbreak that has sickened dozens of people in Havana, the capital city of 2.2 million residents and a popular tourism destination

Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.

It has a short incubation period, from less than one day to five days, and produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given.

Vomiting also occurs in most patients.

But recent outbreaks in nearby Haiti have killed more than 7,200 people.

'Due to the measures adopted transmission is in the phase of extinction,' it said.

But in off-the-record discussions with a ministry official and doctor directly involved in fighting the outbreak, a different picture emerged with hundreds of suspected cases.

They said the first cases were traced to a baseball game at the Latin American Stadium in the Cerro municipality of the Cuban capital, where fans come from all parts of the city to watch their team, the Industriales, play.

'We know what happened. Either the pork sandwiches or Tan Rico soda pop was contaminated at a game earlier this month,' the official said.

'Even some of the baseball players became sick,' she added.

The Health Ministry statement said the outbreak had begun in Cerro and 'later spread to other municipalities in the capital.'

Tens of thousands of British tourists Cuba every year and in particular visiting Havana, but there have been no reports of foreigners catching the illness.

Several European diplomats have told AP they are considering issuing travel advisories to citizens planning visits to Cuba, and have been concerned that the government is not sharing information with them in a timely manner.

They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Tourism is the top sector in Cuba's flagging Communist economy, with 2.8 million visitors a year, making Â£1.5billion.

In 2010, 174,343 tourists from Britain visited the country.

A major cholera outbreak is sure to make some visitors think twice about a trip, despite Cuba's sterling reputation in responding to epidemics and natural disasters.

Community clinics and family doctors are on high alert and giving out instructions to prevent the disease, transportation hubs have passengers sterilizing their shoes before leaving town and eateries are being systematically inspected and sometimes closed, residents say.

The official said Havana had been preparing to fight the disease since Cuba's first cholera outbreak in decades last year in eastern Granma province.

There have been scattered cases since then, but all were traced to the Granma area and quickly contained, she said.

'This time is different. There are many cases, but we are well prepared in terms of supplies and the protocol,' she said, adding, 'let's just hope we can stop this before it becomes much worse.'

The lack of official information until Tuesday has led to rumors that dozens have died in the Cuban capital, though the official and doctor said there had been only one fatality.

The family of one man, 46-year-old Ubaldo Pino Rodriguez, told The Associated Press last week that he died of cholera in Cerro on Jan. 2, about two weeks after going to the hospital with severe vomiting.

Rodriguez's sister, Yanise Pino, said her brother had a drinking problem and lived in squalid and unhygienic conditions in a tiny makeshift wooden dwelling.

'When he began to feel bad he thought it was from drinking and nothing else,' she said, adding that he left the hospital of his own accord last month.

She said that following his death authorities sealed off Ubaldo's room and told her to burn all his belongings.

Three Havana hospitals have been designated to handle cholera cases - one for adults, another for children and a third for pregnant women.

Another doctor working at the designated adult hospital, the Center for Tropical Medicine, said they were swamped at the weekend with suspected cases.

Cholera is generally not fatal, but can kill in just a few hours when diarrhea and vomiting cause dehydration, especially among the elderly.

The illness runs its course within a week, making it relatively easy to track, but at the same time is highly contagious, spreading from hand to mouth, through contaminated food and the water supply.

'So far there is no indication its in the water supply, but we are dumping more chlorine in the system,' the Health Ministry official said.

Until 2012, there had been no cholera outbreaks reported in Cuba since well before the 1959 revolution and the creation of a national health system by the Communist government.

Hundreds of Cuban doctors and nurses have worked for over a decade in Haiti which has battled a cholera outbreak that has killed more than 7,000 people since that country's 2010 earthquake.

Cuba lies closer to Haiti than any other Caribbean country, with the exception of the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the crisis stricken country and has reported more than 20,000 cholera cases and 350 deaths since the Haiti epidemic began.
