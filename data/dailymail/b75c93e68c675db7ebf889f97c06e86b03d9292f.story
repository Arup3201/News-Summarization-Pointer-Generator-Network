Gadget maker Samsung is believed to be set to reveal a radical new 'portrait' TV screen next week.

The firm today teased the new set with an online video and teaser claiming it will reveal 'A true innovation of TV design is coming up with an unprecedented new TV shape and timeless gallery design.'

The firm is expected to make the announcement at the annual Consumer Electronics Show being held in Las Vegas next week.

It is where all of the major electronics manufacturers, with the exception of Apple, show off their new products.

The image is accompanied by a video that was recently added to Samsung's YouTube page.

In the video, an array of standard sized televisions are shown travelling to see the new Samsung TV, which appears covered in a sheet.

'As Samsung prepares to unveil a new TV at CES that is unlike anything the world has ever seen, all the other TVs are rushing to see the new TV,' the firm says.

However, a new shape would raise major questions over what viewers would actually be able to watch without requiring Hollywood studios and TV broadcaster to produce material in a new shape.

Samsung often reveals prototype products at CES, last year debuting its 'Smart Window' technology, which featured a touch-controlled interface atop transparent glass, which the firm showed off running twitter and other apps.

Multiple reports have suggested that Apple is exploring this market as well, though it is not clear when Apple will introduce its own television product - although believe it could be later this year.
