Scot Young pictured with his ex-fiancee Noelle Reno - who called off their longstanding engagement before his death

The final, desperate moments of the tycoon who plunged to his death on to spiked railings outside a £3 million apartment can be revealed today. 

Neighbours said there was a furious row between businessman Scot Young and his ex-fiancee Noelle Reno. She  made a frantic call to police – moments before he fell from a fourth-floor window. Noelle Reno had been angrily attempting to order him out of their shared apartment on Monday before he died.

A source  said: ‘He just turned up unannounced inside the flat. She said, “What are you doing here? You’re not supposed to be here.” He was manic, crazy and probably high. It escalated.

‘Noelle removed herself from the situation by leaving the building and called the police on the way out.

‘She told them, “You might want to turn up, there’s a crazy man here. He’s gone mental. He won’t leave.” Noelle headed off to a girlfriend’s house. The police turned up at the apartment and then found him.’

Police say foul play was not involved and have given no credence to reports that Young’s death, on Monday, was connected with the Russian mafia. New details have emerged about the relationship between Ms Reno and Young in the days and weeks leading up to his death, and about the shady business deals he became embroiled in. We can reveal that:

Ms Reno, 33, had told friends that Young had been drinking heavily and using cocaine.

The American-born model turned TV presenter had said before he died that he was ‘in a terrible state’ and had been threatening to harm himself if she refused to go back to him.

Although they had split up, they had continued to share the apartment until a few days before the fatal incident, when Noelle had ordered him to live elsewhere. She had been making arrangements to change the locks.

She had said that Young ‘was not in a good place’, had embarrassed her at a number of society events and had at times smelled of alcohol. 

Noelle, it is said, had been reluctant to publicise the news of their split because of his fragile mental state. Young had already attempted suicide, had been into rehab and been sectioned twice under the Mental Health Act.

It is believed that he had arranged to be admitted to a mental health unit on the day he died.

Property tycoon Young had already attracted considerable notoriety thanks to a bitter divorce dispute with his former wife Michelle, who in a series of high profile interviews and court hearings had accused him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters. 

The courts had found in Michelle’s favour, ordering Young to pay £20 million, and he spent time in jail for refusing to disclose details of his complicated finances.

There was further controversy when it emerged that high-profile individuals, including Sir Philip Green the Top Shop owner, had loaned him considerable sums of money. 

However it seems that on a day-to-day basis Ms Reno was funding his activities – and that this had become a major bone of contention.

One friend said Ms Reno had told her: ‘It’s not OK to have to pay for a 52-year-old.’

It is understood that Ms Reno spent time discussing the death with the police on Friday, and later met Mr Young’s daughters.

An indication of Young’s state of mind before his death was given by his close friend Jim Creed, a 64-year-old businessman from Ealing, West London.

Mr Creed said: ‘He kept phoning and phoning me on Monday. He was in a terrible state. He told me he had booked himself into a mental institution, that he was not well but that he would be out next Thursday.

‘He was very animated and emotional saying I was his best friend and how much he loved me. Scot was bi-polar and had been in and out of clinics, he wasn’t well. It was the stress of it all, he deteriorated in the past five years.

Mr Creed added: ‘I didn’t think he was suicidal. He had hopes and plans for the future, he wanted to start a new life and was convinced he would make his money back.’

Noelle had said that Young ‘was not in a good place’, had embarrassed her at a number of society events and had at times smelled of alcohol

Young always described himself as a property developer who grew fabulously rich on the back of the building boom of the 1990s and 2000s.

By 2006, he had accumulated a £60 million property portfolio, including a £21 million nine-bedroom mansion in Oxfordshire, a string of properties in London’s exclusive Eaton Square, and a £6 million mansion in Miami Beach. 

It is said Young and his associates owned a complete terrace of six stucco-fronted townhouses in Regent’s Park and a 118ft yacht registered in Palma, Majorca.

In addition, he had an investment portfolio of stocks and shares which netted him around £2 million a year, and businesses which paid him a similar amount in commission. His total fortune was estimated at a conservative £400 million, and he liked to spend it.

On Michelle’s 40th birthday, he presented her with £1 million of Graff jewellery. Other presents included a new Range Rover stuffed with couture clothing.

But it has been claimed that his fortune was based on devising schemes to launder money belonging to the super rich through a web of offshore accounts. He used the money to finance huge deals, usually involving property, but sometimes buying and selling fine wines, works of art or vintage sports cars. 

The burgeoning assets market meant that the shrewdly-chosen deals almost always made money for his clients, while providing ways to make shady or undeclared money legitimate.

Former business associates claim that inventive book-keeping could even provide tax shelters for his wealthy clientele. He and his partners would, say, pay £250,000 for a vintage Ferrari, but claim in accounts that it actually cost far more.

Thus, when the car was later sold on, the declared profit would be tiny and the outlay, which could be claimed against tax, large.

Young soon came to the notice of businessmen with huge sums of money to launder. One was the Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who amassed an estimated £2 billion fortune amid the collapse of the Soviet Union and moved to London in 2000 after falling foul of President Putin.

Young and his associates, it is claimed, would take 30 per cent commission on every pound they laundered.

And as their personal wealth increased, they would increasingly take personal stakes in the quick-turnaround property deals they executed.

At one stage in the last decade, Young was said to be the single most important client of the upmarket estate agency Knight Frank, which specialises in palatial properties.

But as he grew wealthier, and his work on behalf of exiled Russian oligarchs increased, Young began to move in circles where even his famously deft mind could not help him. 

It is said that Berezovsky masterminded a secret property investment codenamed Project Moscow, which collapsed with enormous debts ten years ago. 

Young at one time owned 50 per cent of the venture, which was based on plans for a giant retail complex in the Russian capital. He later sold off five per cent shares to eager associates.

No one knows whether the Russian government pulled the plug as part of a ‘sting operation’ against Berezovsky, but it is certain that Young and his accomplices were badly burned. Leading figures in the Russian mafia are also said to have lost heavily.

Several of Young’s closest associates are known to have invested and have since died, including Berezovsky, property tycoon Robert Curtis and Paul Castle, a polo friend of Prince Charles.

A fifth member of the so-called ‘Ring of Death; around Young, Johnny Elichaoff, 55, the former husband of TV presenter Trinny Woodall, died in November after falling from a shopping centre in West London. 

A sixth, lawyer Stephen Curtis, who introduced Young to his Russian contacts, died in a mysterious helicopter crash in 2004, a week after telling friends he feared for his life.

Young’s fortune was built on a reputation for trustworthiness and discretion. So when ex-wife Michelle engaged on a messy and high-profile divorce after he left her for another woman, it is understood his business associates became instantly alarmed. She hired lawyers and forensic accountants to unravel his secretive businesses.

Police say foul play was not involved and have given no credence to reports that Young’s death, on Monday, was connected with the Russian mafia

In 2009 he was sentenced to six months in prison for refusing to reveal details of his wealth. After six years of litigation between the couple, described as ‘quite extraordinary’ by a judge, Young was ruled to be worth £40 million and ordered to pay his former wife half. 

He never paid a penny, while his daughters’ school fees and rent for Michelle’s home was paid by friends and a series of shadowy companies.

While claiming penury, Young continued to lead an extravagant lifestyle – living in a luxury penthouse, driving a Ferrari – and then meeting glamorous Noelle. When challenged, he insisted he was living off the goodwill of friends.

Michelle believed Young had hidden millions from her. After his death, she may find that if there is a fortune somewhere, it will be a whole lot harder to track down.
