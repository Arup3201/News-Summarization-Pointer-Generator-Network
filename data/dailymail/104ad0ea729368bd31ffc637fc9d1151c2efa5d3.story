A seaside 'land train' run by the same family for 46 years has been scrapped by a local council, so it can instead put its own trains on the route.

The novelty attraction near Bournemouth - thought to be the first of its kind in the country - was hand-built in 1968 by Roger Faris and is still run by his 88-year-old widow Joyce.

But more than 17,000 people have protested after Bournemouth Borough Council told the pensioner it would not renew her licence for the three motorised trains in November.

Outrage: Joyce Faris, 88 (pictured) has been told she will no longer be able to run the 'land trains' introduced by her late husband 46 years ago - so Bournemouth Borough Council can run its own service instead

Hitting the buffers: The council told Mrs Faris its decision is final despite a petition signed by thousands

Popular: The train runs every hour at Mudeford beach, pictured, which has 350 upmarket beach huts

All aboard: Mrs Faris employs five drivers and a mechanic on her set of three novelty land trains

Instead the council will run its own 'land trains' on the one-and-a-half mile path from Hengistbury Head to Mudeford beach in Dorset.

The council claims its trains will be better because they will have 50 per cent more seats, disabled access and modern engines with lower emissions.

They will also eventually run directly along a six-mile route from the beauty spot to Bournemouth seafront, once they link up with the trains the council already runs.

But fans of the current trains, which have eight carriages each, criticised the 'insensitive' news - which was delivered to Mrs Faris on the same day her grandson died.

A petition calling on the council to keep the current service, which locals affectionately nicknamed the Noddy train in 1960s as an adaptation of its original name of 'toy town train', has gained more than 17,000 signatures in a few days.

It was also given a mention by BBC breakfast radio presenter Chris Evans today, who said: 'I just feel sorry for the Noddy Train and the people that run it and the kids that enjoy it.'

History: Joyce Faris with her late husband Roger with one of their trains in the 1970s. She said the train was her 'life' and she runs it more as a hobby than to turn any profit. There are fears that fares could go up

The first train, pictured when it launched, was built by Mr Faris with the help of driver Robert Jowitt, pictured.

Cheery: The hand-built trains, pictured in 1977, were thought to be the first of their kind in the country

The good old days: An early version of the train when its engine more resembled a ride-on lawnmower

Despite the council promising to freeze fares at their current level for the next year, day trippers 
fear they will then rise sharply so the authority can turn a profit.

Mrs Faris - who employs five drivers and a mechanic - said she makes almost no money from the trains, which she runs every half hour charging £1.20 for an adult one-way ticket.

A full-day fare on the council's 
trains costs £5 or £18 for a family. However, a spokesman said a one-way
 ticket on the same route would be frozen for a year.

Support: BBC breakfast radio presenter Chris Evans said he felt sorry for the train staff

Mrs Faris said: 'I had no idea they were planning this. I thought the council were going to renew the contract like they do every year.

'I wasn’t in a very good state at the time because I found out my grandson had died and I told the people from the council that but they went ahead with the meeting.

'I couldn’t take it in at and I wasn’t ready for it and just agreed with them.

'I don’t have the words to describe how I am feeling. Really it’s just disgraceful and a total shock.

'The train is my life and I have run it more as a hobby than a business.

'The current profit margins are such that you would have to have another job because you can’t make a living out of it.'

Alan Barnard, 51, who has been the 
land train mechanic for 22 years, said: 'If the council aren’t shamed by
 this they ought to be. I feel we have been stabbed in the back.

'Someone who has spent 45 years working with them deserves more respect than has been shown here.'

He said Mrs Faris had continued investing in the trains, replacing the carriages and buying new parts as recently as last year.

'The
 council say they'll offer us a transfer but I'll refuse out of 
principle,' he told MailOnline. 'They can offer me whatever they want 
but I'm not joining them.

'It's
 fantastic that we've had so much support but I don't think the council 
will change their mind. They've done things despite public protests 
before.'

Iconic: The train has been a Bournemouth tourist attraction for 46 years and features in postcards

Scenic: Another postcard shows the train on a summer's day while holidaymakers ride animals alongside

Affectionate: The origins of the Noddy train's nickname came when it was originally named a 'toy town train'. Its official name is the Hengistbury Head land train

Devoted: Mrs Faris still runs the service along this stretch of coastline 364 days a year at the age of 88

Mr Faris built the train after the 
council called on people to find an alternative way of travelling to the
 beauty spot, which was overrun with cars.

His construction was believed to have been the first novelty land train in the country.

The
 engineer was granted a one year trial and the service was deemed so 
successful he continued running it until his death in 1980.

Mrs Faris then took over the running and still works in the office today.

The train also takes visitors and the owners of 350 exclusive beach huts to the Mudeford sandbank.

One resident posted on an internet forum: 'My family have been using the train for years. My mum went on it as a girl, I did and now my children. It is more valuable than numbers on a spreadsheet.

'It is also very disrespectful to the lady who has dedicated her life to running it. Where is the morality in this decision, some things are more important than money.'

Happy memories: Roger and Joyce Faris, together far right, with staff members in the 1970s

On track: The train had a party to mark its 40th anniversary in 2008. Right, Mr and Mrs Faris in the 1970s

Derailed: Mrs Faris said she received the shocking news shortly after discovering her grandson had died

Bournemouth council's cabinet member 
for tourism, Lawrence Williams, claimed Mrs Faris had agreed to the 
closure and derided the online petition because those signing it had not
 given their addresses.

He told the Daily Echo: 'If they want us to take the petition 
seriously, they should take the names and addresses of people who live 
in Bournemouth, as we do not know where these people are from.'

The council also denied its 5.5ft-wide trains will struggle to pass each other on the 10ft-wide path, and said rumours that the train will be branded by Disney are untrue.

In a statement, he added: 'The existing land train service at 
Hengistbury Head has served the area well for a number of years and I 
would like to thank Mrs Faris for her dedicated work during this time.

'With
 the current licence set to expire and after much consideration we feel 
that the time is right for the council to take ownership of the 
service.'
