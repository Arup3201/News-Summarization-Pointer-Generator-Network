It may only just be summer, but one experimental chef is already getting busy in the kitchen preparing to offer us a range of Christmas treats we'll remember until spring 2013.

Heston Blumenthal, the Michelin star-winning chef famed for the snail porridge served in his unconventional Bray restaurant The Fat Duck, has announced the festive collection he will be cooking for and selling through supermarket chain Waitrose.

And this year his menu - which arrives 167 days before the big day - is as bananas as ever. In fact, one dish even contains bananas....

Ho ho ho: Chef Heston Blumenthal has already unveiled his crackers Christmas menu for Waitrose

Sweet treats: Heston's Christmas pudding will actually taste of chocolate brownie

Among the items Blumenthal has devised are a traditional fruit cake 
that looks like a Christmas pudding but is decorated in white chocolate and tastes like a chocolate brownie - after all, why have one dessert when you can have three?

There will also be a cranberry sauce made 
with vodka, a bread sauce with truffle oil and a gammon baked in mulled cider.

One of the festive favourites promises to be a baked Alaska with a raspberry parfait, encased in chocolate, surrounded by a caremalised banana parfait instead of ice cream.

But none of these offerings should come as much of a surprise to anyone who knows the sort of cooking Blumenthal is famous for.

Last year the chef brought us pine-sugar mince pies that smelled like Christmas trees, the year before was all about the Hidden Orange Christmas Pudding, so popular it sold out two years running and was eventually being sold on eBay for £250.

Anyone who missed out on the pudding last year shouldn't worry too much, as they will be able to try again this time around when it goes on sale for the third year in a row.

Speaking about his baked Alaska, Blumenthal said: 'Baked Alaska is a childhood favourite of mine. I love the juxtaposition of the soft meringue against the smooth creamy interior, but I hated the idea that it all melted so quickly.

'So I was inspired to create my take on the old school classic by creating a raspberry mousse centre which gave the creaminess without melting and adding one of my favourite flavours – bananas!'

Waitrose spokesman Andrea Watson said: 'In recent years Heston has really captured our shopper’s imagination at Christmas.

'I’m sure that just like our Hidden 
Orange Christmas puddings his version of the Baked Alaska will be 
extremely popular with Waitrose shoppers this Christmas.'

The Heston From Waitrose range will be available from October 2012.

It seems Blumenthal's fellow Waitrose 
chef patron Delia Smith had better get experimenting if she wants to 
compete for our attention....
