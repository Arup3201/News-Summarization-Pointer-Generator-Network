Prices have plunged downhill at ski resorts, offering British winter sports enthusiasts good value for money this year.

In-resort costs have slid as much as 23 per cent compared with last winter, a survey by Post Office Travel Money in partnership with Crystal Ski Holidays found.

The 23 per cent fall was in the Andorran resort of Soldeu, one of 19 destinations out of 27 surveyed where costs were lower than last year.

How different resorts compare in Europe - Austria and Switzerland remain a pricey option for families

The survey covered costs such as equipment, six-day passes, lessons and food and drink.

Total costs were at their lowest in Bansko in Bulgaria (£261), while other good-value resorts were Kranjska Gora in Slovenia (£300), Ellmau in Austria (£311) and Livigno in Italy (£322).

Priciest of the European resorts surveyed was Zermatt in Switzerland (£687).

Ski holidays across Europe are now cheaper

The best-value of the six North American resorts surveyed was Tremblant in Quebec, Canada, where the costs were £566. Costs in Breckenridge in Colorada, US, have fallen 17 per cent to £682, but they have risen 21 per cent at another Colorado resort - Winter Park - where costs are £607.

Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'Although skiing is still cheapest in Bulgaria and Slovenia, growing competition for business means there are great bargains to be struck in many of the most popular European resorts this season.

'What's more, the continuing strength of sterling against European currencies provides the added bonus of more pounds in their pockets for UK skiers.' 

Among 10 World-Class Resorts surveyed, prices are down 13 per cent in Sestriere to £354, making the Italian resort best value in this category for the second year running. 

There has also been a 16 per cent fall in Courchevel (France) to £503, although the reverse has proved true in Zermatt (£687). High ski hire and lift price charges will make the Swiss resort 16 per cent more expensive than last year and highest-priced overall in Europe.

In the Best for Families category, Bansko (£848) remains the cheapest skiing for a family of four. However, Kranjska Gora (£1,110) has lost its runner up position because of a significant 18 per cent price fall in both Soldeu (£982) and Ellmau (£985).

Mr Brown added: 'It's great news that families can look forward to lower prices in most ski resorts this season. However, it is important for them to check all the resort costs they will face and add these to the package price before deciding on a ski destination so they have a true picture of what their holiday is likely to cost them.'

After the Sochi Winter Olympics spotlighted the growing number of winter sports now available and Crystal Ski Holidays confirmed mounting demand for these, the report includes prices for activities ranging from tobogganing, snowmobiling and ice skating to high adrenaline sports like snow tubing, ice climbing, paragliding and husky sledging. 

In almost all cases the charges for these are payable once holidaymakers reach their resort and can add hundreds of pounds to the cost of a skiing holiday.

'Enthusiasts can now try out a wide range of winter sports activities but these extras come at a price and careful budgeting is needed to make sure the ski budget does not go 'off piste'. Paying on plastic can incur transaction charges and so too can using an ATM abroad, said Mr Brown.

Bulgarian resort Bansko is the best option for families, costing £848 for a family of four once there

Best value transatlantic ski resorts, with Canada coming in with the cheapest prices

Other items will cost skiers extra as well – not least the cost of airport transfers if you don't book with a ski operator, which can add at least £50 per person for the return trip. Plan ahead and allow enough money to cover transfers and après ski events as well as extra ski equipment hire.'

In North America, Tremblant (£566) emerges as best value of six Transatlantic Ski Resorts surveyed for this year's Post Office Travel Money Ski Resort Report. A nine per cent price fall – mostly the result of a weaker Canadian dollar – has compounded the impact of last season's 21 per cent drop. 

By contrast, prices in Winter Park, last year's best value tip, have risen 15 per cent to £607. Rising rates for ski equipment, lift passes and tuition account for the increase. 

For those who want high-end, these are the prices of world class resorts around the world, per person

Elsewhere in Colorado prices have plunged 17 per cent in Breckenridge (£682), mostly as a result of a fall in ski-related charges, and almost eight per cent in Vail (£751). 

Tamsin Todd, Crystal Ski Holidays managing director, said: 'We've seen that Britain's successes in the Olympics and Paralympics have renewed interest in snow sports with people looking for fun and active holidays. 

'Now that ski resorts are open for the season, we can't wait to get back to the mountains and are ready with our digital and mobile advances to help make customer experiences better than ever.'
