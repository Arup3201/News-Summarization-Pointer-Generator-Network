General Sir Walter Congreve VC. Sir Walter's remarkable letter revealing his reluctance to fraternise with German soldiers during the Christmas Day truce in 1914 is set to go on public display tomorrow

As the artillery fell quiet, Tommies and German troops famously put down their weapons, emerged from the trenches, played football and swapped gifts in no man’s land.

But General Sir Walter Congreve, VC, shunned the Christmas Truce of 1914 – because he didn’t trust the Germans to resist shooting an officer of his high rank, a letter he wrote to his wife reveals.

Congreve, who led the Rifle Brigade, wrote the letter after visiting troops in a section of trench known as Dead Man’s Alley in northern France on December 25, 1914.

He describes what he saw there as ‘an extraordinary state of affairs’ and tells of troops and officers from both sides ‘walking about together all day giving each other cigars and singing songs’.

Congreve, then 52, who won his Victoria Cross during the Second Boer War in 1899 and was known as ‘Squibs’, adds: ‘I was invited to go and see the Germans myself but refrained as I thought they might not be able to resist a General.’

The letter came to light during research to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. It was donated to Staffordshire’s archive service by the Congreve family decades ago and was recently unearthed by researchers.

In the letter, Congreve, whose parents were from Stafford, shows little sense of lasting Christmas spirit towards the enemy.

After being told ‘the best shot in the German army’ was among the cigar smokers enjoying the truce, he tells how he ‘devoutly’ hopes ‘we down him tomorrow’. The letter also illustrates the unofficial nature of the truce and how it was not upheld along the entire Western Front.

‘Next door the two battalions opposite each other were shooting away all day and so I hear it was further north, 1st R.B. playing football with the Germans opposite them – next Regiments shooting each other,’ Congreve wrote.

Congreve, who was educated at Harrow School and Oxford University, later lost a hand in action but survived the Great War. He went on to become governor of Malta, where he died in 1927 aged 64.

British and German troops put down their weapons and mingle in No Man's Land during the Christmas truce of the First World War in 1914

His son Major William ‘Billy’ la Touche Congreve was honoured with the VC after being killed at the Battle of the Somme in 1916 – making them the only instance of a father and son in the same regiment to be awarded the Army’s highest military honour.

Historians say Congreve’s reasons for not joining in the truce were not without foundation.

World War One author Alan Cleaver said: ‘Some soldiers died on Christmas Day 1914. They got out of the trench thinking there was a truce and they got shot by Germans who didn’t want a truce. So it was a very courageous thing for them to do.’ Anthony Richards, head of documents and sound at the Imperial War Museum, said: ‘There are various accounts of the Christmas Truce story and this is a particularly interesting addition.’

The letter is being displayed at the council record office in Stafford.

÷ The Advertising Standards Authority said there are no grounds for further investigating the Sainsbury’s Christmas TV advert recreating the 1914 truce which some viewers found ‘distasteful’. The watchdog received 727 complaints, but said ‘the ad is not likely to break the rules surrounding serious harm or offence’.

On Christmas Eve, 1914, British and German troops in Flanders, Belgium, put down their weapons for a 48-hour truce.

It was part of a series of widespread, unofficial ceasefires that took place along the Western Front. 

Many soldiers, from both sides, independently ventured into No Man's Land where they mingled, exchanging food and souvenirs.

Troops collected their fallen and held joint burial ceremonies. Several meetings also ended in carol-singing. 

The most famous event of this day was the game of football played between the two sets of soldiers.

The match reportedly started when a football was kicked by one of the British troops into No Man's Land.

Sadly Christmas Truce of 1914 was never to be repeated. Next year, strongly worded orders came from the high commands of both sides prohibiting troops from fraternising with each other.

By 1916, after battles of the Somme and Verdun, warfare had become unprecedentedly bloody and no more truces were sought.

In it, the senior commander detailed how news of the Christmas Day football match spread quickly along the front-line, and his own fear that he might be shot by the enemy during the truce
