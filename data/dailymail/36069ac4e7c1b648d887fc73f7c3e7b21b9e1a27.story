A woman tossed a baby and a toddler out of a second-story window of a Las Vegas home Thursday before jumping from the window herself.

Authorities said the three were transported to University Medical Center.

Police responded to the scene in a middle-class neighborhood in northeast Las Vegas at around 5.50am to discover a 35-year-old woman lying on the ground next to her 1-year-old daughter and 6-month-old son.

The two children suffered apparent head injuries, and the mother sustained a spinal injury.

The toddler was listed Thursday in extremely critical condition and his sister was in critical condition, reported KTNV.

Investigators believe the woman was trying to kill her children before taking her own life. Her family  told police she has been battling depressed, Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

'We don't know why she did it,' said Officer Larry Hadfield.

Maria Cortes, who lives down the street in the 3700 block of Spiritual Way and saw ambulances Thursday morning, described her neighbors as a couple with three children.

Cortes said she didn't know them well but said hello from time to time.

'They looked like a happy family,' she said.
