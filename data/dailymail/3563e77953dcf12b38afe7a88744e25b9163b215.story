August and Arthur are two lucky cats, with quite a tale to tell.

Back in August, the kittens brought the subway in Brooklyn to a standstill for several hours after they wandered onto the tracks - causing delays for commuters and even sparking a mayoral debate.

Now, the cheeky duo have been adopted by a couple who live in the borough.

Keith Lubeley, 33, and his wife Katherine Lynn, 30, were among the hundreds of people who wanted to adopt the now 11-week-old felines.

'We don't really know what made us stand out, since the application didn't exactly have an essay question,' they told the Daily Intelligencer.

The couple, who live in a Brooklyn Heights apartment, added: 'Maybe our desire to help rescue animals came through in the few words we were allotted to describe our interest in these guys.

'That and the fact that we've each been cat owners in the past, live in a relatively quiet place, and don't have kids or other pets.'

Katherine, who works for a theatre consulting firm, and Keith also said they would be voting for mayoral hopeful Bill de Blasio - and not Joe Lhota, who himself played an indirect role in the furry saga.

The two kittens were caught between the rails on subway tracks in the Brooklyn borough of New York at the end of the August

The pair caused an outage on the B and Q lines which lasted several hours

candidate Joe Lhota said that he would not have shut off subway service 
to rescue the kittens

Lhota, the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, said he wouldn’t have stopped the subway as the kittens scrambled along the tracks.

A spokesman for Lhota told the New York Post at the time that the candidate did not think stopping service for wayward cats was appropriate.

He said Lhota believed it should be the MTA’s call whether to shut down the line.

Passengers on the lines were stranded while police officers chased the cats down the tracks 

Back on August 29, power was cut on B and Q lines in Brooklyn for more than an hour as the two lost kittens scurried around the tracks.

They were finally rescued about seven hours later and were treated at an animal shelter.

Lhota’s rivals in the mayoral race, among them Anthony Weiner, told the paper they would’ve stopped trains to save the pets.

A spokesperson for the disgraced former congressman went even further, saying that the candidate would have risked his own life to rescue the helpless critters.

'If Anthony is elected mayor, he will not only stop trains for kittens, he will personally crawl over the third rail to do it,' Barbara Morgan told the Post.

Campaigning outside a subway stop Friday, Mr Weiner jokingly told the New York Daily News that if elected mayor, he would put in place a comprehensive subway kitten rescue policy.

Other candidates also stated their position on the issue of whether or not to stop the trains for the kitties. Christine Quinn came out on the side of the furry felines, as did Bill Thompson's campaign.

The aptly named John Catsimatidis deferred to the MTA or police, but noted that he is an animal lover who once owned a beloved feline named Cottonball.

For former City Councilman Sal Albanese, it was a no-brainer.

‘What are we, nuts? Of course I would’ve stopped,’ he said. ‘This almost never happens, but when it does, we can’t just go running over kittens.’

While the mayoral hopefuls were opining on the fate of the kittens, August and Arthur were recuperating at an Animal Care & Control shelter in the East New York section of Brooklyn.

The then 8-week-old pets were kept together as they are underwent physical and behavioral tests.

August and Arthur, who each weighed around 2lb at the time of rescue, were vaccinated and  transferred to a foster home.

When the two tiny felines were spotted frolicking on the train tracks near the Church Avenue station in Brooklyn about 11am, MTA workers turned off the power.

Passengers on the B and Q lines were stranded for about two hours while police officers chased the cats down the tracks.

According to the Wall Street Journal,
a spokeswoman said police officers went onto the tracks to roust the 
cats so they wouldn't be at risk. She also said the MTA did not wish to 
accidentally 'fry' the kittens.

Crews suspended regular service from 
DeKalb Avenue to Brighton Beach and Stillwell just after 11am and provided shuttle buses.
