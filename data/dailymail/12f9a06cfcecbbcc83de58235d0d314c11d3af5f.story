This music is guaranteed to send shivers down your spine.

The incredible sounds are the work of Ice Music, a Swedish orchestra from the town of Luleå, who have taken the concept of being ‘cool’ literally.

That’s because their instruments - including guitars, violins, cellos and even xylophones - are all hand-carved out of ice sheets.

Swedish musical group 'Ice Music' work with instruments made almost entirely out of sheets of ice

Different bands show up to use the icy instruments which were all crafted by ice connoisseur Tim Leonhard.

Mr Linhart said he creates the ‘ICEstruments’ by hand before adding strings, fret boards and other parts to his designs.

The songs are performed inside an igloo-like concert hall, which is also covered in ice, and seats around 170 people.

All the instruments stay in tune, as long as the temperature stays cold enough

This isn't the first time someone has tried to make instruments out of ice

Terje Isungset from Bergen in Norway became known as the Iceman after he started making music with instruments carved out of blocks of ice drawn from a nearby lake.

His amazing frozen creations include harps, trumpets, horns, guitars, marimbas and even a iceridoo - a frozen version of the Australian didgeridoo.

Mr Isungset claims every instrument he makes has a unique sound and while one ice horn he created was used for 50 performances many only last for a single session.

Both the instruments and the concert hall are lit up in colours representing the northern lights.

The video, showing the local band Whiteroom covering Avicii’s ‘Hey Brother’, reveals the impressive sound that a few slabs of frozen water and some strings can make.

What's amazing is that all the instruments stay in tune, as long as the temperature stays at -10°C.

According to Mr Linhart, the instruments have to be re-tuned after every performance as the breath of the musicians partly melts them.

For this reason, the violins are suspended from the ceiling so that the musicians body temperature doesn't melt them.

53-year-old Mr Linhart arrived in Luleå a decade ago from New Mexico. He helped build one of the world's first ice hotels, but claims music is his real passion.

‘My personal interest in this is to make it real music, not just clinking and dinking on a bunch of hanging ice cubes,’ he told CNN in an interview.

Mr Linhard claims that because Ice is stiffer, it picks up all the vibrations, making the listener's hair stand on end.

'You might think the sound on a normal instrument is perfectly 
clear--until you hear an ice instrument and go, "Ah ha!" The clarity is 
crystal,' he said.
