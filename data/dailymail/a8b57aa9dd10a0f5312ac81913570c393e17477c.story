They are the ultimate accessory to the world's rich and famous - elite and fearless lookalikes prepared to brave even the most open of open spaces to protect their employer.

And while Michael Jackson, Marilyn Monroe and Adolf Hitler all had at least one, the latest celebrity to apparently get her own body double was revealed today - as six-year-old Suri Cruise.

The daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes was allegedly replaced by a doppelganger during a day out in New York in a daring bid to hoodwink pursuing paparazzi, according to a local newspaper.

Body double? This is the girl reported to be Suri Cruise's body double. The girl appeared to be wearing the exact same clothes as Suri when she came out of the SUV and entered a sandwich shop in New York

The real Suri? The New York Daily News claims the real Suri Cruise was carried out of another SUV that arrived at a side entrance of the eatery minutes later

The New York Daily News said
its reporters spotted Ms Holmes collecting Suri from her Manhattan 
school before heading in an SUV to the city's TriBeCa district for a 
bite to eat.

But when  the car stopped at the 'Wichcraft sandwich shop on Greenwich Street - with the usual phalanx of photographers in toe - a different girl in an identical outfit leapt out with a nanny, the paper claimed.

She
was wearing the same purple puffer coat as Suri, the same black 
leggings and pink-soled Ugg-type boots and had the same colour hair. 

But the Daily News claims it was not Suri at all.

The paper told how, minutes later, another SUV arrived at a side entrance of the eatery and out popped the real Suri Cruise with a different nanny.

The identity of the imposter is unknown, nor is it clear whether the young pair are friends of just colleagues.

The only clue is that she was seen chatting to Ms Holmes in the street a month ago, the Daily News claims.

It has been reported that Tom Cruise has recently beefed up security surrounding Suri and met with risk analysts and abduction experts.

A source told the Daily News: 'They have talked with them specifically in relation to Suri and her well being.

'These guys deal with kidnap threats of families and children for super rich people and corporations.

'They work in high risk territories and targets around the world. They advise on how to best prevent subjects being placed in compromising situations, while offering protection solutions, too.'
