A kit to build a toy car which has stayed in its original packaging for more than 80 years is expected to sell for more than a new, full-sized car.

A red Meccano kit which dates from 1930 has been unearthed by auctioneers Bonhams, and will be put on sale later this month.

The kit contains its original instructions, and is bundled in a wooden case with a more recent silver edition of the same kit.

Set: The classic red Meccano set, from 1930, is bundled with a silver version from 1995

Intricate: The red toy car, seen here inside its box, has never been unpackaged

The ornate miniatures - touted for decades as 'the Perfect Miniature Motor Cars' - are powered by a wind-up clockwork motor.

They go on sale as a bundle during Bonhams' two-day 'Gentleman's Library' sale taking place on 28-29 January in Knightsbridge.

The toys are stored in a brass-banded box, which holds both kits - which have never been assembled - in a 56cm x 44cm x 22.5cm space.

The lot has been given a guide price of between £10,000 and £15,000.

The older kit forms the Meccano number 2 model constructor clockwork motor car, famous for its vivid red body and light blue trim.

Package: The Meccano sets were once touted as the 'perfect miniature motor cars'

Instructions: This manual from 1930 shows how to construct the vehicle

Bundled: The 1930 red car is being offered at auction alongside this silver version from 1995

The silver model dates from 1995, and is branded with the maker's mark for Garrard and Co Ltd, London.

A statement from Bonhams said: 'The inter-war years saw Meccano produce some of the finest quality mass-produced metal toys ever made in the UK.

'After 1920, its range expanded, with the successful Aeroplane and Motor Car Constructor sets appearing on the market in consecutive years.

'The motor car models consist of custom parts that allow a range of car variations, and are driven by powerful Clockwork Motors, fueling long, speedy runs on just one winding.'
