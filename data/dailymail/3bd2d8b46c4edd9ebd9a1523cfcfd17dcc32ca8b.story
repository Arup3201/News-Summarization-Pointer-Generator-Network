Scandal-hit security firm G4S is to be responsible for protecting the world’s most powerful men and women after to winning a contract to stand guard at next month’s G8 summit.

The much-criticised firm made such a mess of providing security of the London Olympics last year that the army had to be drafted in to keep the event safe.

But today ministers insisted the company had learned the lessons of last summer’s fiasco and could cope with preventing an attack on the leaders of the world's eight wealthiest countries at the summit in Northern Ireland.

G4S security staff have been drafted in by the government to protect the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, despite last year's fiasco where it failed to provide enough guards for the London Olympics

The scandal-hit firm will be tasked with securing the site when it plays host to world leaders including British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, US President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande and Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper

The company is to supply 450 employees to guard the G8 event at Lough Erne golf resort in June.

The leaders of the G8 include US President Barack Obama,  Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, French President François Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, Russian President Vladimir Putin and UK Minister David Cameron, who plays host this year.

After the Olympics debacle, G4S’s chief executive Nick Buckles was hauled before MPs, where he admitted it was a ‘humiliating shambles for the company’

Failed to train enough guards for the London Games which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave

A guard at Heathrow ordered Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse to change out of her uniform before flying to the US because it was 'offensive'

In 2011, staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over Birmingham Prison Workers put an electronic tag on criminal Christopher Lowcock's artificial limb

Despite claims at the time that the company would struggle to win government contracts again after putting the world’s biggest sporting event in jeopardy, it landed the deal to provide security to the G8.

Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers insisted the government was confident that G8 could cope this time, despite police warnings of thousands of protestors descending on the site.

‘The G8 is considerably less than the numbers that were required for the mammoth operation at the Olympics,' she said.

However Ms Villiers declined to say 
how many extra troops would be deployed to Co Fermanagh for the two-day 
summit next month but said military assistance would be used to back up 
the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).

Army helicopters will be used to fly world leaders and their entourages to and from the event outside Enniskillen.

Northern Ireland-based company Event Sec will also be used to secure perimeters and to carry out searches.

Ms Villiers added: 'Of course in relation to the Olympics very serious concern was expressed about the failings of G4S.

'Lessons have been learned and the contracts awarded by the Foreign Office take into account those lessons.

'In fact one of the reasons why we have two firms in this instance, not just G4S but Event Sec as well, was to build in further resilience.'

A total of 3,600 police officers from forces in England, Scotland and Wales are being drafted into Northern Ireland to bolster the 7,500 from the PSNI.

The UK government chose the Lough Erne Resort in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland to host the gathering of the world's most powerful leaders

However, the Secretary of State refused to be drawn on further details of the Army's role.

The leaders of the world's eight wealthiest countries are expected in Fermanagh on June 17 and 18.

Meanwhile, PSNI chief constable Matt Baggott said he expected thousands of protesters to descend on Northern Ireland during the G8 Summit.

He said: ‘We are expecting demonstrations in Belfast and we are expecting some in Enniskillen as well. I would anticipate thousands. There are many routes into Northern Ireland.’

The Government had to draft in additional security helpers from the Armed Forces after G4S failed to fulfill its contract for the Olympic Games

With just weeks before the London 
Olympics opened in July last year, G4S admitted it would not be able to 
provide the thousands of guards it had promised.

Its reputation was severely damaged when 3,500 troops were called in to provide security at the biggest events.

GFS chief Nick Buckles admitted the Olympics fiasco had been a 'humiliating shambles'

G4S was left nursing losses of £88 million after it failed to provide all of its 10,400 contracted employees last year.

The fiasco wiped millions of the value of the firm, which has an annual turnover of some £7.5billion.

The company provides security at 14 UK
airports and four ports, and also runs six prisons, four children's 
homes and two immigration centres, and tags 14,000 offenders.

It has also made major in-roads in to carrying out police work, providing security at 500 police stations and 30 custody suites.

And last month it emerged staff from the company were being hired by police forces to run murder and rape inquiries.

Senior investigators from the firm – ridiculed for the Olympics security fiasco – are even helping overworked officers on the Jimmy Savile sex abuse case.

Retired detectives are earning more than £60,000 a year in their new roles, on top of lucrative gold-plated public sector pensions.

For the G8, the company said its staff will provide stewarding, monitoring of site perimeters and securing access to venues.

The company has previously provided support to a number of international summits on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, including the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles and the G20 Summit in London.

Eric Alexander, managing director of G4S Events, said: ‘We are delighted to have been awarded this contract and be given the opportunity to use our proven expertise to help the PSNI secure this extremely high profile event.’
