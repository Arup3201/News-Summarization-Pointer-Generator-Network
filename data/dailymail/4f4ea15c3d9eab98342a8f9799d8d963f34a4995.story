Home-owners on the brink of having their homes repossessed may be offered an unexpected reprieve, after it emerged it may take up to 62 years for banks and the courts to process the backlog of claims.

At the current rate of repossession, analysts calculated it would take lenders in New York state 62 years to process the 213,000 threatened houses - the longest in the country.

In New Jersey it would take a staggering 49 years to clear the backlog, while it would take a decade to repossess all the outstanding homes  In Florida, Massachusetts and Illinois - all of which use the courts to process claims.

Speaking to the New York Times, Herb Blecher from Real estate data firm LPS Applied Analytics said: 'If you were in foreclosure four years ago, you were biting your nails, asking yourself, ‘When is the sheriff going to show up and put me on the street.'

'Now you’re probably not losing any sleep.'

For those in the 27 states who do not use a court based repossession process, the outlook however is not so rosy.

LPS calculated that in California it would take just three years to clear the backlog, while in Nevada and Colorado it would take only three.

Despite the grim outlook for some, repossessions are down nationally by a third since last fall.

The news came as it emerged almost one in every 100 households are receiving foreclosure notices in a Western state.

The number of home-owners being put on notice for being behind on their mortgage payments dropped in May to its lowest level since 2006.

But despite the slowing housing market and lingering delays in bank foreclosure processes, one in 103 households in Nevada went on notice.

The second-highest rate is one in 210 in Arizona, followed by one in 259 in California, but Nevada has now topped the list for more than two years.Five states created more than half of foreclosure filings, led by California at 51,906 - but this was far ahead of second-placed Florida, on 19,192.

Mortgage lenders also took back fewer properties in May for the second month in a row, foreclosure listing firm RealtyTrac said on Thursday.

Many mortgage lenders are still working through foreclosure document problems that surfaced last autumn.

The delays continue to push the two million U.S. homes already on banks' books or in some stage of foreclosure further into limbo.

They also suggest banks will repossess 200,000 fewer homes in 2011.

‘The problem with that, even though it sounds better, is that all of those foreclosure auctions we should have seen this year roll into next year,’ said Rick Sharga, a senior vice president at RealtyTrac.

‘That means it's going to take that much longer for the housing market to recover.’

The pace of homes entering the foreclosure process and those ending up as bank-owned properties began slowing sharply last autumn.
