Battered, bruised and blood-stained, this is the face of an a 82-year-old man who bravely fought off two burglars.

Joseph Carter was beaten and stabbed in his head and body when he confronted the thugs in his £400,000 house.

The men pinned the retired scrap yard owner to the ground and slashed him several times with a kitchen knife.

Despite the severity of his injuries,
the pensioner, who lives alone in Guildford, Surrey, found the strength
to see off his attackers.

Dripping in blood and badly injured, Mr Carter managed to chase the men out of his home.

He then staggered to a nearby garage 
where shocked mechanics tried to stem his blood with paper towels. 
Witnesses said he looked like something out of a horror film.

One employee described seeing the OAP
walking towards him soaked in blood. The man, who did not want to be 
named, said that he had known Mr Carter ‘all his life’ but failed to 
recognise him at first.

He said: ‘There was this man standing
there just covered in blood from head to toe – the blood was literally 
dripping into his shoes.

‘I was standing there just thinking 
“How can he still be alive”, but then I realised who it was and said 
“Joe, Joe, is that you?"

‘He said he had been pinned down on 
his kitchen floor by two men and that they had used a kitchen knife to 
stab him in the head several times.’ He added: ‘He had been beaten to 
within an inch of his life, but he could still speak to me.

‘Joe used to run a scrap yard and 
he’s super tough, but he’s a harmless old man who would never do anyone a
wrong turn.

'These people need to be tracked down and caught as soon as 
possible – if they are capable of doing that to an old man they are a 
danger to everyone.’

Photos released by Surrey Police show the severity 
of Mr Carter’s injuries including deep gashes across the top of his head
and a cut to his nose so deep it exposed the bone.

He also suffered serious wounds to his hands and arms as he struggled to defend himself during the senseless assault.

Mr Carter is currently in a stable condition in intensive care at Frimley Park Hospital in Camberley.

Police have released these shocking photographs of Joe Carter as they appeal for witnesses to the attack

Mr Carter was attacked in his own home on Aldershot Road in the Normandy area of Guildford. Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward

His neighbours said that he had never
married and had no children. It is believed that his only living 
relative is a sister in her 90s who lives nearby.

The pensioner, who was described as 
being in good shape for his age, rents out two houses next to his own 
home and is often seen mowing his lawn or pruning trees in his garden.

Local resident Sandra Grayson, 53, said: ‘Joe is well known around here –
he’s always out and about and loves speaking to people. He’s the 
friendliest soul in the world and for him to be attacked like this in 
his own home is truly awful.

‘He put up a good fight though and wasn’t about to let people like this steal his belongings without standing up for himself.’

Another neighbour, a man aged in his 
30s, who didn’t want to be identified, said he believed Mr Carter had 
been beaten with an iron bar during the attack. However, police refused 
to confirm this.

Detective Constable Dan Chant said 
the attack, which took place between 12pm and 4.30pm on Friday, was 
‘horrific’ and appealed for witnesses to come forward.

He said: ‘This was an horrific 
unprovoked attack on an elderly man and I am appealing for any 
information which might help locate these offenders.’
