Diego Costa was lucky not to be seriously injured in Chelsea's latest pre season outing, just managing to get out of the way of a terrible two-footed tackle from Fenerbahce defender Bruno Alves.

It might have been a friendly but the uncompromising Portuguese centre back seemed to be taking it seriously - diving in for a dangerous challenge on Chelsea's £32million forward.

Combative Costa was right in the 32-year-old's face immediately after to let him know what he thought of the foul, but the guilty party was let off by the referee with just a yellow card.

Aggression: Costa makes it clear what he thinks of Alves after his terrible tackle in Istanbul

 The summer signing from Atletico Madrid had earlier put the Blues ahead, escaping four defenders to score a brilliant goal to set up a 2-0 win - but Alves was determined to make sure he wouldn't be doing the same thing again.

With the Fenerbahce centre back left as the last man on a Chelsea counter attack, Costa pushed the ball slightly too far forward and Alves saw his opportunity to take it before sending his man tumbling in a tackle that could have broken his leg if it was a split second earlier.

With just Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres as backup, Chelsea are pinning their title hopes on the Spain striker - and will be relieved to see him escape from Istanbul unharmed.
