Syria has agreed to allow UN inspectors access to sites in suburbs of Damascus where alleged chemical attacks occurred on Wednesday.

The concession follows accusations that Bashar Assad's regime is responsible for a chemical attack which killed more than 350 people - many of them children - on Wednesday.

Syria has denied that it is to blame while many Western officials claim the 
poisoning was caused by a chemical agent used in a rocket attack carried
out by government forces.

Negotiations: UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Angela Kane, has been pushing for weapons inspectors to be able to access the site since the chemical attack on Wednesday

Under fire: The heavy shelling came just hours after Syria reached an agreement with the United Nations to allow a UN team of experts to visit the site of alleged chemical weapons attacks outside Damascus

A statement released by the Syrian government said: 'The Syrian government and the United Nations agreed on a common understanding ... to allow the United Nations to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use in the Damascus suburbs.'

Many hundreds of people were poisoned to death on Wednesday before dawn in what appears to have been the world's worst chemical weapons attack since Saddam Hussein's forces gassed thousands of Iraqi Kurdish villagers in 1988.

The incident took place just three days after a UN chemical weapons team arrived in Syria to investigate other smaller allegations of poison gas use. The inspector team's movements must be agreed with the Syrian authorities.

The two leaders want to send a clear warning to dictator Bashar Al-Assad over the deaths of as many as 1,300 people, many of them children

The Syrian statement said that the date 
and time of the inspectors' visit to the site had been agreed, but it 
did not say when it would take place.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem met UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Angela Kane - who was in Damascus to negotiate access - this morning.

Moualem stressed 'Syria's readiness to cooperate with a team of investigators to uncover false allegations by terrorist groups that Syrian troops used chemical weapons.'

U.S. President Barack Obama and top advisers are debating options for responding to the reported use of chemical weapons in Syria amid what Britain called 'increasing signs' that the Syrian government was responsible for the attack.

Warning: Iran has warned the U.S. President Barack Obama, pictured on Friday as he walked across the South Lawn of the White House, of 'severe consequences' should America cross the 'red line' on Syria

President Obama appeared on CNN's 'New Day' on Friday to discuss the alleged attack, saying it was a 'big event of grave concern' that requires American attention

A senior U.S. government official told 
Reuters: 'Based on the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of 
those who were killed or injured, witness accounts, and other facts 
gathered by open sources, the U.S. intelligence community, and 
international partners, there is very little doubt at this point that a 
chemical weapon was used by the Syrian regime against civilians in this 
incident.

'We are continuing to assess the facts so the president can make an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use of chemical weapons.'

Meanwhile Iran has warned the United States it will face 'severe consequences' if it crosses the 'red line' on Syria.

Deputy chief of staff of Iran's armed forces Massoud Jazayeri said: 'America knows the limitation of the red 
line of the Syrian front and any crossing of Syria's red line will have 
severe consequences for the White House.'

Prepared: Chuck Hagel, right, says the President has ordered the Pentagon to prepare potential military options

David Cameron and Barack Obama discussed the plan in a 40-minute phone call at the weekend and will finalise the details within 48 hours

President Obama has been holding talks with David Cameron over the growing crisis in Syria.

The Prime Minister and the U.S. President discussed the conflict by telephone last night and have ordered officials to examine 'all options'.

A Downing Street spokesman said the leaders spoke for around half an hour.

'They are both gravely concerned by the attack that took place in Damascus on Wednesday and the increasing signs that this was a significant chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian regime against its own people,' he said.

'The UN Security Council has called for immediate access for UN investigators on the ground in Damascus. The fact that President Assad has failed to co-operate with the UN suggests that the regime has something to hide.

'They reiterated that significant use of chemical weapons would merit a serious response from the international community and both have tasked officials to examine all the options.

'They agreed that it is vital that the world upholds the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons and deters further outrages. They agreed to keep in close contact on the issue.'

President Obama previously suggested that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would be a 'gamechanger'.

But he has stopped short of committing to direct intervention in the troubled country - a step that would risk inflaming tensions with Russia.

Mr Cameron would also face domestic resistance to military action, with Tory MPs already having insisted there should be a Commons vote before arms are supplied to rebels.

Accusations: The Syrian opposition has accused the government of carrying out a deadly chemical attack on its own people

Confirmation: The charity said around 3,600 people in total were treated for nerve gas symptoms in Syria

However, there is speculation that the U.S., Britain and France could back limited airstrikes to demonstrate that deployment of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.

Mr Cameron also spoke to Canadian PM Stephen Harper, who agreed that the 'international community must respond appropriately'.

Medecins Sans Frontieres said hospitals it supports in Syria treated some 3,600 patients with 'neurotoxic symptoms', 355 of whom died.

It said the patients had arrived in three hospitals in the Damascus area on Wednesday. Staff described people suffering from convulsions, extreme salivation, contracted pupils and sight and respiratory problems.

However, the organisation stressed it could not 'scientifically confirm' the use of chemical weapons.
