The Victoria’s Secret worker disfigured in an acid attack has condemned police as ‘incompetent’ for mistakenly suggesting she was responsible.

As a former friend began a 12-year jail sentence for the attack, Naomi Oni, 22, said the police accused her of lying when she claimed she had been stalked by her attacker, who was wearing an Islamic veil.

Speaking about her horrific experience, Miss Oni said she did not understand the police’s tactics when evidence pointed to Mary Konye being the attacker.

‘All I’ve done is receive pain and backlash for her actions and other people’s incompetence,’ she said. ‘All I’ve done the whole time is just say what’s happened to me and I’ve been accused of doing it to myself, accused of lying basically.

‘The police are incompetent in terms of accusing me of doing it to myself when I’ve said that someone followed me from my workplace.

‘When I was in court and I saw the CCTV footage, you can blatantly see that what I said is what happened, so where did that accusation come from?’ She claimed the police missed key evidence from the CCTV film.

‘The police weren’t acting on what I was saying,’ said Miss Oni. ‘I was even told that they watched the CCTV footage and saw no one following me.

‘We saw the footage and there was a person in a veil following me. Why was this not found at the beginning? Nobody has answers.’

Miss Oni was attacked by Konye, 22, a university student, who followed her home from work wearing a niqab that covered her face, Snaresbrook Crown Court was told. When they were alone, Konye threw sulphuric acid in her face, nearly blinding her. Miss Oni now has to wear a silicone mask.

Konye, of Canning Town, east London, claimed her friend asked her to carry out the attack because Miss Oni wanted ‘fame and fortune’ like Katie Piper, the model who suffered a similar attack. But her claims were rejected by the jury.

Miss Oni told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday that when the police finally told her the identity of the attacker, she could not believe it.

‘I couldn’t eat for days,’ she said. ‘I didn’t want to believe it, it didn’t make sense.

‘I even asked maybe did she send someone to come after me. They looked at me like, “You still don’t get it. She is the person under the veil,” and I cried, I cried and cried.’

The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ‘The investigation was complex and officers had a duty to explore every avenue of inquiry.

‘The CCTV evidence took some time to analyse but then clearly showed a veiled suspect trailing the victim.

‘Konye was arrested as the investigation progressed.’

CCTV footage obtained by police after the attack showed a figure in a niqab following her as she left work at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford at around 11.30pm
