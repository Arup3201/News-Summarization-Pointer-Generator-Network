The day before Brodie Smith died he told his girlfriend he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.

But before he could propose, the West Australian man died while on a trip to take Ibogaine - a 'miracle' cure for his drug addiction, reportedly ice, derived from an African plant that tribes use as a hallucinogen.

Mr Smith died on Ko Phangan - an island in the Gulf of Thailand - as his girlfriend, Kara Spark, watched helplessly as he stopped breathing, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

They were in Thailand to get treatment for Mr Smith's drug addiction and were planning the rest of their lives together. 

Just 24 hours before he died, the man from Mandurah, Western Australia, told Ms Spark he was going to propose to her.

Ms Spark said her boyfriend died after ingesting Ibogaine - a hallucinogenic drug from Africa 

'The night before was the most amazing, he said he was going to propose, it was the best feeling I've ever felt, I would say yes, I wanted nothing more then to marry you,' Ms Spark wrote on Facebook.

'I knew Brodie was the one... I've honestly never been happier.

'We celebrated, made plans for "Brand New" tattoos, this was meant to be a new beginning for Brodie and myself.'

Ms Spark said they exchanged vows of love and he 'held me in his arms' that night.

But these dreams were shattered when the couple went to the Ibogaine Thailand retreat on October 20. 

This is where Mr Smith started a treatment program that cost $5,300 and would take place over four days. 

There are conflicting reports about the circumstances of Mr Smith's death. 

Ms Spark told Fairfax Media they he was administered his first dose of the African plant at 8.30pm.

The plant has been classed by the World Health Assembly as likely to cause harm to humans, and has been identified as having psychedelic and psychoactive properties.

Ms Spark claims Mr Smith was given another dose of Ibogaine at 9am the next day.

More than two hours later Ms Spark claims Mr Smith was told to take two blue-coloured tablets which was meant to be Valium and make him drowsy.

But she claims it all went wrong when Ms Spark said her boyfriend was short of breath 20 minutes later.

'Then he stopped breathing. He was staring at me with his eyes wide open,' Ms Spark said.

She then tried to revive him but was unsuccessful in trying to bring him back to consciousness.

The director of the Ko Phangan treatment centre Mike Picone told Fairfax Media Mr Smith was never given Ibogaine.

Mr Picone claims Mr Smith was battling a methamphetamine addiction and as part of the treatment program he had to be clean for at least five days before he could start taking ibogaine.

He said the Australian died in his hotel room after he overdosed 'from injecting illegal narcotics' that Mr Smith brought into Thailand from home.

'After he died his girlfriend, Kara, produced a freshly used syringe and gave it to the police as she was reporting to them that he had shot up in the shower and overdosed,' the director said.

The Mandurah man died after he stopped breathing. Ms Spark said she tried to revive him but was not successful

'All my hopes dreams were shattered and now become impossible,' Ms Spark wrote on her Facebook

Ms Spark denies Mr Picone's version of the events surrounding her boyfriend's death.

Her Facebook page is filled with constant tributes to her 'soulmate' who loved to sing in the shower and her chocolate lasagne.

'All my hopes, dreams were shattered and now become impossible,' Ms Spark said.

'I love you so much Brodie Noel Smith with every single part of me.'

On her Facebook page dedicated to Mr Smith, Ms Spark wrote she would 'fight to death for justice' as his family calls for a inquest into his death and the use of ibogaine.

His mother, Dianne Tucker, said she never wanted what happened to her son to be repeated.

'The parents of anyone with an addiction problem have usually been to hell and back, dealing with all the traumas that come with drug use,' she said.
