U.S. narcotics agents with Top Secret clearances had wild 'sex parties' with prostitutes hired by Colombian drug cartel members, according to a blockbuster report from the Justice Department's internal investigations arm.

The Drug Enforcement Agency has yet to comment on the findings in the exposé from the DOJ's Office of Inspector General. At least seven DEA agents admitted to investigators that they had sex with hookers while on overseas assignments.

But instead of firing or prosecuting them, the agency treated their cases as a 'local management issue' and suspended them for between 2 and 14 days.

The IG cautioned in the report, released Thursday morning, that U.S. law enforcement personnel who engage in illicit sex – even in places where it's legal or unofficially tolerated – can be vulnerable to 'coercion, extortion, and blackmail.'

The Republican chairman of the congressional panel that specializes in inter-governmental investigations lobbed rhetorical bombs at the Justice Department after the report surfaced online, calling its allegations 'truly stunning.'

'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz.

'We need to hold them accountable and, given the clear evidence in the OIG report, they should be fired immediately,' he said of the offending agents. 

'We need to weed out those who risk our national security, embarrass the county, and skirt the law.'

Chaffetz promised that his panel, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 'will pursue this vigorously' after next week's congressional recess. 

In all, the IG report flagged 621 cases where agents in the FBI, DEA, ATF and U.S Marchalls Service were accused of a wide variety of sex-related offenses. 

They ranged from sexting and sexual liaisons between supervisors and subordinates to the consumption of child pornography and sexual abuse of minors and prison imnates.

In the prostitudion cases, the IG wrote, 'DEA supervisors treated the alleged misconduct as a local management issue' even though the 'these special agents held Top Secret clearances.'

One case involved agents 'patronizing prostitutes and frequenting a brothel while in an overseas posting. ... It was also alleged that one of the subjects in the supervisors’ group assaulted a prostitute following a payment dispute.'

'The Acting Assistant Regional Director who supervised the two special agents in this case,' investigators wrote, 'was also alleged to have solicited prostitutes ... In that case, the AARD allegedly engaged in sexual relations with prostitutes at a farewell party in the AARD’s honor.'

'There were also allegations operational funds were used to pay for the party and the prostitutes who participated.'

In all, six hookers attended that soiree. Supervisors allegedly knew about it but never referred the case to the DOJ for disciplinary action.

A tipster ultimately blew the whistle on two of the agents, claiming in an anonymous letter to DEA higher-ups that they had frequented prostitutes on a regular basis while on oversead tour-of-duty assignments.

In a separate case, the inspector general describes DEA agents who attended prostitute 'sex parties arranged by a Colombian law enforcement officer and funded with money from drug cartels themselves.

The parties, the IG said, happened in the agents' government-leased apartments over a period of several years.

Agents' laptops, BlackBerry devices, and other government-issued equipment were typically lying around, creating 'potential security risks' and potentially making agents vulnerable to 'extortion, blackmail, or coercion.'

Foreign officers later claimed they held on to the American agents' guns  while they were indulging in the hooker-fests.

They also claimed they gave three DEA supervisory agents 'money, expensive gifts, and weapons from drug cartel members.'

Ultimately, 7 of the 10 agents the IG interviewed admitted taking part in the 'sex parties.' They were suspended for between 2 and 10 days, but never prosecuted criminally. 

Overall, the DEA limited its punishment to a maximum of 14 days, in part because Colombian authorities generally turn a blind eye to the sex trade.

'The DEA Inspector told us that prostitution is considered a part of the local culture and is tolerated in certain areas called "tolerance zones",' the GI wrote. 'According to the Inspector, it is common for prostitutes to be present at business meetings involving cartel members and foreign officers.' 

ANGRY: 'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz

The DOJ's inspector general found a wide range of sex-related offenses in the case files of the FBI, DEA, ATF and US Marshals Service, including sex with prostitutes and sexual assault of minors

The U.S. Marshalls Service also got a black eye in the inspector general report.

In one 2010 case described in detail, two deputy marshalls traevled to Thailand to pick up a criminal defendant who was being extradited to the United States.

Every time the State Department tried to contact one of the men, one of two women with foreign accents would answer his phone and say he couldn't be disturbed.

'A local investigator for the State Department spoke to one of the women in Thai' and 'confirmed she was a prostitute,' the IG wrote.

When he got home, the deputy was forbidden to travel overseas again. But he fuond a way to conduct at least one more extradition mission anyway and kept his security clearance.

A nother deputy 'entered into a romantic relationship' with the spouse of a fugitive criminal suspect. 

When his supervisors told him to break off the fling, it took him a year to do it. 

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was relatively unscathed by the IG investigation, with one glaring exception.

An ATF Director of Industry Operations, investigators wrote, 'solicited consensual sex with anonymous partners and modified a hotel room door to facilitate sexual play.' 

Management at the hotel caught him disabling a fire detection system; he insisted he had done it before with no problem. 

Separately, an FBI Assistant Section Chief who trained his fellow agents on child exploitation and human trafficking issues 'engaged in multiple consensual and commercial sexual encounters over a 7-year period,' according to the report.

His partners included 'foreign nationals, including prostitutes, strippers, students in his classes, and members of foreign law enforcement.'
