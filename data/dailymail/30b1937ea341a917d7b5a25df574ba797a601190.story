A hospital trust at the centre of a police investigation over allegations staff were forced to change cancer waiting times data has been placed in special measures.

Last week it was revealed the head of cancer services at Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust had been put on leave after a report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) suggested a number of cancer patients had suffered 'undue delays'.

CQC inspectors found that there were 'inaccuracies' with waiting time data relating to cancer treatment.

Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust has been placed in special measures after a Care Quality Commission report found a number of cancer patients suffered 'undue delays'

Staff told inspectors they were 'pressured or bullied' to change data relating to patients and their treatment to make it seem as though people were being treated in line with national guidelines.

As a result some patients may not have had the treatment they needed in time, according to the CQC.

The Daily Mail last week reported how Rachel 
West, who is in charge of cancer services at the trust, had not been seen at work for several weeks, although the trust 
denied she had been suspended. Insiders said, however, she was on 
'special leave'.

The health sector regulator, Monitor, has now put the trust in special measures 'to ensure all its patients receive good quality care'.

A formal investigation by Monitor found the trust had breached its licence to provide health services.

Under special measures, the trust will be required to 'put right the patient quality, safety and governance concerns highlighted by the CQC', Monitor said.

Trust chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts (left) said the trust was contacting all 30 patients - or their next of kin where patients have died - identified by the CQC report. Chief inspector of hospitals, professor Sir Mike Richards (right), welcomed Monitor's decision to accept the recommendation to put the trust in special measures

An improvement director will also be appointed by Monitor to ensure the trust turns itself around.

The hospital will also be matched with a high-performing trust which can offer support and expertise.

The trust must also publish and update an action plan that can be viewed by the public, Monitor said.

Adam Cayley, regional director for Monitor said: 'Following the urgent actions already taken to safeguard patients at the trust we have stepped in formally to assure the health and wellbeing of patients using the cancer pathway at Colchester.

'The trust has been given an explicit set of actions to improve the service it offers patients. We will be monitoring progress closely and we will not hesitate to take further regulatory action if required.

'The leadership of the trust will be reviewed as part of our scrutiny of the trust's governance arrangements and, if necessary, further regulatory action will be taken.'

Trust chief executive, Dr Gordon Coutts, said: 'Everyone at the trust was extremely concerned about the problems identified in the CQC report.

'We are truly sorry that in some cases 
cancer patients, their carers and families have not been given the high 
quality of care this trust always aims to provide.

- Monitor has ordered the trust to 'put right the patient quality, safety and governance concerns highlighted by the CQC'

- The regulator will appoint an Improvement Director to ensure the trust 'turns itself around'

- The trust will be matched with a high-performing trust which can offer support and expertise 'in delivering improvement to the cancer pathway'

- The trust will be required to publish and regularly update an action plan that can be viewed by the public

- The regulator has also imposed an additional licence condition to make sure the trust has the 'necessary capability in place to run the trust'. The regulator said: 'If the leadership of the trust fails to act appropriately, this condition allows Monitor to take further action'

'We have already taken action in response to the findings of the CQC report and we are continuing to address all of the concerns that were raised.

'Our priority is the safety and well-being of all our patients.'

Dr Coutts said the trust was contacting all 30 patients - or their next of kin where patients have died - identified by the CQC report.

Chief inspector of hospitals, professor Sir Mike Richards, said: 'We welcome Monitor's decision to accept my recommendation to place Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust in special measures.

'I am pleased that information from CQC's inspection has resulted in the action that is being taken by Monitor to improve services at the trust. CQC will continue to monitor the trust in line with its regulatory responsibilities and this will include further inspections.'

Last week a spokesman for Essex Police said it had been contacted by the CQC and was reviewing the information to establish whether a criminal investigation was necessary.

Every year around 6,000 people go to Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust to be treated for cancer.

Unison
regional head of health Tracey Lambert said: 'The decision to take 
Colchester Hospital into special measures is the right one.

'The trust board has lost the confidence 
of patients and the public in north east Essex and people want to see 
strong, positive action to improve health care at the hospital.

'Unison members alerted executive directors at the hospital that they were being bullied into falsifying data relating to the treatment of cancer patients, but their concerns were not dealt with.

'We know that our members in other departments also believed they would not be listened to if they spoke out about their fears. Unison repeatedly made this point to the trust .

'In light of what has happened at Colchester, there is a need for a significant change of leadership and we look forward to working with the new regime.'

A police officer died following a 'disastrous' childbirth at Colchester General Hospital, an inquest has today heard.

Diane Patt, 34, died just hours after giving birth to her second child at the hospital in September 2011.

Mrs Patt, a police constable based near to her home in Colchester, Essex, suffered a ‘massive haemorrhage’ losing five litres of blood.

Today an inquest at Chelmsford Coroners’ Court heard damning criticism from hospital staff about failures to replace lost blood.

Professor Mohammed Khaled, consultant on call at the hospital on the night PC Patt died, said: 'I did not have any concerns because I thought the blood had been replaced.

'We expect most women to recover, even from such blood loss, and it is very unfortunate that she did not get the blood replacement. I do believe if she had been given blood, she would still be with us.'

PC Patt was admitted to Colchester Hospital on the evening of September 18, 2011.

She gave birth by ventouse at 8.20pm, following a failed forceps delivery, but sadly died just hours later at 11.57pm. Her newly-born daughter survived.

A post-mortem gave the cause of death as a massive haemorrhage which triggered cardiac arrest.

PC Patt had been keen to have a normal delivery following a caesarian section for the birth of her first child. But problems came when a qualified registrar conducted a failed forceps delivery with Neville Barnes forceps.

Professor Khaled said: 'Seeing the report, it could have been better. The registrar was not able to use Keilland’s forceps - she should have called me.

'I was busy in another room. She did not even tell me she was going to use them.'

Prof Khaled had been busy writing notes yards away in a neighbouring room.

He explained his weekend on call had been ‘horrendous’ with only brief opportunities to catch up on paperwork.

He said: 'I commenced duty at 8.30am on Saturday, September 17.

'Unfortunately, that weekend was a horrendous weekend where I spent most of my time in hospital.'

Prof Khaled returned home shortly after helping stitch up PC Patt following her daughter’s birth but was called back by panicked midwives.

He said: 'She rang me and said "Khaled they did not ask me to call you but I would like you to come straight away as we need your calming hands".

'That call indicated disaster as she is not someone who panics. For her to call me without the doctors asking means a big problem.'

Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray suggested notes revealed ‘a bit of light-heartedness’ between staff as they looked to stabilise PC Patt’s condition.

Widower Sergeant Major Jason Patt, of Colchester’s 7th Parachute Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, was in court alongside other members of PC Patt’s family.

The inquest, which is scheduled for three days, continues.
