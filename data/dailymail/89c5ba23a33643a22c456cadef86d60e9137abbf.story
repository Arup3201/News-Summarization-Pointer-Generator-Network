An aide to Wisconsin governor Scott Walker has been fired after posting an anti-Latino rant on Twitter.

Taylor Palmisano, the Republican's deputy campaign finance director, was sacked yesterday following the posts on the social media site. 

In one post, the 23-year-old complained about an individual who was doing custodial work in a library where she was working.

She posted: 'I will choke that illegal mex cleaning in the library. Stop banging f****** chairs around and turn off your Walkman.' 

Two months earlier, she posted a tweet about her bus trip from Pasadena, California, to Las Vegas after watching the Wisconsin Badgers play.

She wrote: 'This bus is my worst f****** nightmare Nobody speaks English & these ppl dont know how 2 control their kids #only3morehours #illegalaliens'

Her Twitter account has since been deleted.

In August another aide of Walker's, Steven Krieser, assistant deputy secretary of the Wisconsin department of transportation was fired after writing on Facebook that illegal immigrants were the spawn of Satan.

Walker's re-election campaign risked a Scrooge image last week with a Black Friday promotion asking parents to make campaign contributions instead of buying their children Christmas presents.

'Instead of electronics or toys that will undoubtedly be outdated, broken, or lost by the next Holiday Season,' a Walker re-election campaign email instructed, 'help give your children the gift of a Wisconsin that we can all be proud of.' 

Two months earlier, she posted a tweet about her bus trip from Pasadena, California, to Las Vegas

It was 'a Black Friday special that is better than any deal found in stores,' the campaign claimed: 'Donate $5, $10 or $25 to help Governor Walker get reelected and save your children from a future of double-digit tax increases and billion dollar budget deficits.'

Walker is riding a wave of popularity in his home state that has political wags speculating about a presidential run in 2016.

It was Taylor Palmisano, who had served as the campaign's deputy finance director since July, who signed the email.
