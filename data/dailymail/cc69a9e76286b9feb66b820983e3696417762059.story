Stacey Warren and Kelly Acres are identical twins - but you would have no idea by looking at these photos of the pair.

Stacey, 40, shed half her body weight after gastric bypass surgery - and now she's half the size of 20-stone sister Kelly.

The cleaner, from Exeter, Devon, once weighed 20 stone like her sister but has now dropped a staggering 11 stone, leaving her weighing just 8.8 stone.

Stacey, who has dropped from size 30 to a svelte size eight had her operation paid for on the NHS because she has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can make losing weight naturally difficult.

And now envious Kelly wants one too - but has to wait for the green light from NHS.

Stacey said: 'We joke that we're not identical anymore, but while it's great for me, I think Kelly finds it hard.

'I feel like half the woman I was and my husband jokes that he's got a new wife.

The twins both once weighed 20 stone but since her operation, Stacey is half the size of her sister

'There has been times when jealousy 
has set in. Kelly has accused me of rubbing her face in how good I look 
now, but I'm just happy.

'Before,
if we were ever teased about our weight, at least we could console each
other. Now she says she no longer feels like a twin.

'In the past if she ever lost weight I did feel envious - so I know how she is feeling.'

Two
years ago Stacey had the op after fertility experts warned her and 
husband Colin, 45, she would have to lose weight to conceive.

Over 12 months Stacey shed half her weight and gave all her old clothes to Kelly.

The twins were once bullied at school for their weight and would gorge on kebabs and crisps

Kelly also wants to have the operation but has to lose another stone before she can be considered

Although Kelly is jealous of her sister's remarkable weight loss, she is proud of her and says she deserves it

Shop assistant, Kelly, mother of Tristan, 18 and Matthew, 22, also suffers from PCOS and arthritic joints related to her weight.

However, doctors say she needs to lose a stone before she can be considered for the surgery.

Stacey said: 'When we were younger we were simply known as The Twins. People used to say to us, "which one are you?'".

The pair were dressed the same by their mother and they were truly inseparable.

'We were bullied at school and called "the fat twins" but we always stood up for each other when the other was getting picked on.

'We used to stock up on sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks each day before school because our mum wouldn't let us eat them at home.

'After leaving home I continued to eat a lot of the wrong things like crisps, pasties and kebabs.

'Over the years we've tried diets and weight loss classes but the weight has always come back.'

Stacey was already a size 18 and weighed 14 stone when she met her husband, aged 20, but over the years her weight crept up due to crisp binges and weekly Chinese takeaways and kebabs.

She said: 'I always considered myself pretty and I had a big personality - but I didn't want people to look at me and say nice face, shame about the body.

'Now I'm half the person I was and so much healthier. Even friends of the family I haven't seen for a long time haven't recognised me.

'I was always a skinny person in a fat persons body. I know that Kelly is too and I hope we can be identical again in the future.'

Size 26 Kelly, who is engaged to bar worker Muhammed Choudhury, 27, says she has suffered with PCOS for the last five years, during which her weight has fluctuated wildly.

She said: 'I went from 26 stone to 20 stone then up to nearly 23 stone. Now I'm 19.5 stone and working hard to lose enough to get the go ahead for surgery.

'Although I'm ecstatic for Stacey, it's definitely been traumatic seeing the transformation she's gone through.

Stacey lost 11 stone, taking her to 8.8 stone, and from a size 30 to an eight

'Sometimes I look at her and think "you're nothing like me anymore" and I think she thinks the same.

'When she was big neither of us liked having our pictures taken and now that she's slim she's more, "look at me now".

'Every time she has her picture taken it goes up on Facebook and I'm like, "here we go again".

'But I'm not jealous of what she's achieved. If anything I wish it was me that had lost the weight.

'At the end of the day she's done so well and she deserves it. We're still best mates and it will take more than this to make me see her differently.'
