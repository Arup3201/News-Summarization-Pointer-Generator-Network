Norwich defender Martin Olsson is back on West Ham manager Sam Allardyce's radar.

The Sweden international is likely to leave Carrow Road this summer following the club's relegation in the Championship.

Allardyce has identified left-back as key position to strengthen this summer and is eyeing a move for Olsson.

Free fall: Norwich were relegated from the Premier League after a terrible run towards the end of the season

The 26-year-old worked under Allardyce during his time at Blackburn Rovers, while the manager tried to sign Olsson in January 2013.

Allardyce was waiting for concrete information regarding his job before pressing ahead with a swoop for Olsson.

But after yesterday being told his job as Upton Park boss is safe, Allardyce is keen on pursuing his interest in the Scandinavian.

Allardyce is also tempted by a move for Manchester City's out of contract defender Joleon Lescott.

The 31-year-old will officially leave the Etihad Stadium next month when his contract expires.

Allardyce was keen on taking the central-defender in January, but a deal collapsed towards the end of the transfer window.

But the Hammers boss is keen on adding Lescott to his ranks this season, though his current £90,000-per-week wages could prove a stumbling block.

Pricey: The West Ham manager was also after Joleon Lescott, but his £90k per week wages proved too much
