This is the adorable moment Britain’s dinkiest dog embarked on her first walk despite being too small to fit the littlest of leads.

Pocket-sized puppy Mini is just 7ins long and slips out of every shop-bought collar.

But owner Emma Williams was determined to let her enjoy a walk like other dogs and had to use the handle end of a lead to keep a rein on her.

Even
then, there was little chance Mini would have run off from her owner as
Emma’s walking pace is still as fast as the puppy going at full pelt.

Emma, 29, also wrapped Mini up in an adjusted child’s sock to keep her miniature pet warm.

Despite being pointed at by members of the public and even mistaken for a rat at one point, Mini ran along the seafront at Sandbanks, Poole, Dorset, quite happily.

She encountered a large St Bernard dog which towered over the diminutive dog and appeared bemused by her.

After the walk the Yorkshire terrier-Chihuahua cross breed was so exhausted that she had to take a well-earned rest in Emma’s handbag.

Mini was the runt of a litter of six puppies and weighed just 1.3ozs - little more than an egg - when she was born.

When the tiny dog was born, owner Emma, a marketing accounts manager, fed her milk formula every two hours

Emma, a marketing accounts manager, became a surrogate mum to Mini and fed her aa milk formula every two hours.

The pooch is now almost fully grown but still weighs less than one pound. Dogs of the same breed weigh double what she does at this age.

Emma said: 'When I took Mini out for a walk everyone stopped to talk to her, a few people even thought I was walking a pet rat which was very funny.

'She got a bit chilly when we are out, but I couldn’t find a little coat for her, so I made her a coat out of a children’s sock.

'She can’t fit into a collar yet, she had one made but still hasn’t grown into it and I have the same problem with leads.

'During the walk pretty much everything was an obstacle, so we mainly walked along the beach.

'Mini loved meeting new dogs, although most don’t know what to make of her.

'She may be small but she is the boss at home and she seems to have no idea just how tiny she is.

'Her favourite place in in my Mulberry handbag, which has now become the dog carry case; she obviously has expensive taste.'
