Amanda Knox is at home in America awaiting the verdict of the latest Meredith Kercher murder trial while her co-accused Raffaele Sollecito attended the final hearing in Florence today.

Knox, who yesterday unveiled a dramatic new short haircut in Seattle, is being retried in her absence for the brutal killing of her former roommate in Perugia, Italy, in 2007.

Italian judges at the appeal court have now retired to consider the evidence and are expected to announce their verdict later today.

Knox, who was pictured with her new short bob leaving the downtown branch of Gene Juarez salons on Wednesday, has admitted her 'heart will be in her mouth' today as she awaits the latest verdict.

She told Italian television via Skype
 that she would be at home in Seattle with her mother and family and 
that her lawyer would inform her of the outcome.

Insisting
 she was not involved in the murder, she said: 'The proof is in the 
facts. There is no proof that I was there when this happened. I remember
 Meredith as a person who gave me friendship from the very beginning.

'If I am convicted I understand that I will be seen as a fugitive but I will continue to fight until the end.'

While Sollecito arrived at court today for the final hearing ahead of the verdicts, Knox has already said she will not return to Italy, where there is no statute of limitations for murder, if she is found guilty.

The court hearing today began with the last round of rebuttals by Knox's defence team closing four months of arguments in the third trial for the brutal 2007 murder.

Knox's lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova told the court he is 'serene' about the verdict because he believes the only conclusion from the case files is 'the innocence of Amanda Knox'.

It comes after six years of trials and investigations have so far failed to clear up mysteries surrounding the murder of Kercher, 21, who was found stabbed to death in her bedroom in the picturesque town of Perugia, where she shared a student flat with Knox.

Knox, 26, and Sollecito, 29, were convicted of the murder in 2009 and spent almost four years in jail, but the verdicts were overturned on appeal and Knox immediately returned home to the United States upon her release in 2011, where she has remained.

However, last year, Italy's highest court quashed the appeal ruling due to what it called 'contradictions and inconsistencies' and ordered a retrial.

The case has played out through the 
media as much as through the courts, propelling Knox and Sollecito to 
something approaching celebrity status in their home countries. Armies 
of bloggers battle over disputed evidence about the case online.

Supporters
 of Knox in the United States have done much to transform an initial 
public image of her as a sex-obsessed party girl, which critics say 
prevented a fair trial, to one portraying her as a victim of a faulty 
justice system.

The 
Kercher family has repeatedly called for the full truth to come out 
about the case, and the victim's brother Lyle and sister Stephanie are 
expected to be in court today to hear the verdict.

Knox
 has pleaded her innocence in an email to the court. Sollecito arrived at court for the final hearing today ahead of the verdict later today which could
 lead to his immediate detention or house arrest.

The
 prosecution has asked for Sollecito and Knox to be jailed for 26 years 
for the murder and for staging a robbery to cover it up.

It
 has also asked for a separate sentence of four years for Knox for a 
standing slander conviction, for falsely implicating Congolese bar owner
 Patrick Lumumba in statements to police in which she described hearing 
her roommate scream.

The prosecution says this points to her guilt, but Knox has said she was confused and spoke under duress.

Lawyers
 for Sollecito and Knox argue that only one person is guilty of the 
murder: Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, who is serving a 16-year sentence 
for sexually assaulting and stabbing Kercher. His trial found that he 
did not act alone because of the number and variety of Kercher's more 
than 40 wounds.

The 
initial case argued that Knox and Sollecito had killed Kercher in a sex 
game gone awry, but the prosecution has moved away from this 
interpretation in the current appeal.

The retrial has focused on a re-examination of DNA evidence.

In
 closing defence arguments, Sollecito's lawyer argued that a trace of 
his client's DNA on a metal hook on Kercher's bra clasp was there due to
 contamination, because it was not collected from the crime scene until 
more than a month after the murder and was repeatedly touched.

The
 defence and prosecution contest whether Kercher's DNA was on the blade 
of a kitchen knife from Sollecito's apartment, which had been used by 
Knox.

Whatever the 
verdict, one side is likely to challenge it, and it will have to be 
confirmed by Italy's high court to become definitive.

Italy could ask for Knox to be extradited to serve any sentence, but her legal team is likely to challenge this.

Additionally,
 Knox has appealed her slander conviction to the European Court of Human
 Rights, one of a plethora of spin-off cases from the trial, and could 
do the same if convicted again of the murder.
