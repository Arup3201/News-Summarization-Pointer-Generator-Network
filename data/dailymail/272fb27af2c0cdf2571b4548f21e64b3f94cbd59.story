Rufus the hawk, family pet and patroller of the Wimbledon skies was found safe and well yesterday after being stolen from his owners four days ago.

He was handed in to the RSPCA yesterday and by 8pm was back with his owners.

The four-year-old Harris hawk has become a well-known fixture at the South-West London club as he is used to scare away the pigeons on Centre Court.

Reunited: Rufus has been returned to his owner Imogen Davies

But he was taken from his owners’ 
car, which was parked on their private drive, along with his travel box 
and handling glove on Thursday night.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police,
who had been leading the search for the hawk-nappers, confirmed he’d 
been safely returned to an RSPCA branch in Putney.

Rufus’ Twitter account, written by his
owners, said: ‘We can confirm the news is true RUFUS HAS BEEN FOUND 
safe and well & reunited with family!! Thank you so much for your 
support #FindRufus’.

His owner Imogen Davies, 25, and her family who run Avian Environmental Consultants had been out looking for him all weekend.

A huge Twitter campaign, supported by Merton Police, was launched to try to find him.

Last night Miss Davies posted her thanks on his Twitter account, adding: ‘We are so overwhelmed by all your support.’

Hopes were raised of finding him safe after his box was spotted abandoned in a hedge just north of the All England Club.

The manufacturer, Falcon Fabrication, 
was contacted by somebody who said the box was in Southfields, 
South-West London, and that it contained ‘an eagle’.

Rufus has become so popular among 
Wimbledon fans that they often ask for photos with him. His Twitter 
account has almost 2,000 followers.

This year for the first time, he was 
kept overnight in a parked car instead of being driven home to Corby in 
Northamptonshire each day.

Pigeons are not the Harris Hawk's natural prey, and they are trained not to attack but to circle and fly around the courts to scare the birds

Ms Davis said Rufus was reared by the family-run business, Avian Environmental Consultants.

She added: ‘We work as a team together. To have him taken away like that is just  horrible.

‘It’s a family business, the birds are brought up around us. They’re part of the family. It’s just the way it is.’

Ms Davis said she originally thought 
it was a prank when Rufus was snatched, but was not sure as a falconry glove and falconry hood 
were stolen at the same time.

‘Initially I was almost hoping that it
was a prank because there was more possibility of us getting him back, 
and somebody would realise it was a  stupid thing to do,’ she added.

‘But because the hood and the glove were taken, I’m not sure. I suppose at least it means he’s being looked after.

‘We have another hawk and we can still do our job but we would like Rufus back because we’re very fond of him.’

Bird's-eye view: Rufus even has his own pass for Wimbledon which reads: Bird Scarer

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 
‘Rufus is also a family pet and the family has become very attached to 
the bird.

'They are distressed over the theft and are appealing for help 
to recover the bird.’

Rufus has become a well-known fixture 
at the South-West London tennis club, with visitors often stopping to 
ask for photos with the hawk.

He even has his own Twitter account, but there has not been a tweet for a day.

His last tweet was before Rafael 
Nadal’s shock exit from the tournament, when he said: ‘Murray is 
through, Rafa is down 2-1 (!), Ward played  brilliantly but lost to 
Mardy Fish, and Italy are beating Germany 1-0!’
