A Hawaiian girl had the birthday surprise of a lifetime last week when her biggest wish came true – to see her mother.

Riley Higa, of Wahiawa, who turned 10 on Monday, was missing her mother, Melissa Higa, so much she wrote a letter to President Barack Obama asking if her mother could come home.

Her mother is a senior airman for the US Air Force and has been deployed in South Korea for nine months.

Riley’s grandmother said she could see the distance was painful for the young girl.

‘She was pretty sad, and after her mom talked to her and said she couldn't come home, she told me "I want to write a letter to the president' and I said 'OK we can do that",' said her grandmother, Charline Rich, to KITV.com.

The letter says, ‘Can you please call her boss and tell him or her to please let her off so she can come home for my birthday on Monday?’

Riley ended it with: ‘I miss and love her very much and if she can't come I'll be very, very sad, love Riley Higa grade 4th.’

Life as a solider: Melissa Higa is a senior airman in the US Air Force and has been deployed in South Korea for nine months. She decided to come home when she heard about her daughter's letter to Obama

Her mother decided it was time to come home after hearing about the letter.

And the surprise, which was filmed by a KITV camera crew, was overwhelming.

The girl had just finished reading the letter for the camera crew with tears rolling down her cheeks, saying: ‘I want my mom to come home for my birthday and I haven't seen her since February … I miss her so much’.

Then her mother appeared to surprise her, and hugged her little girl who was overwhelmed with emotion.

‘Everyone says they don't know how we do it, but I think it's the families that sacrifice more. They are the ones that have to wait ... you try not to think about it too much, so when my mom told me that, you know, I wanted to make it big for her,’ said Melissa. ‘It had to be, it had to be big.’
