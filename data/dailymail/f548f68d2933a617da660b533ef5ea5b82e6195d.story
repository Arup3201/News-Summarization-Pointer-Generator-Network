The Duchess of Cornwall has spoken of her pride at opening a new cancer support centre in Aberdeen today.

Camilla was without her husband Prince Charles but was still in royal company as the Queen of Norway, Queen Sonja, also attended the opening of the Elizabeth Montgomerie Building, next to the city's Royal Infirmary hospital.

The building is named after golfer Colin Montgomerie's mother and is a branch of the Maggie's Cancer Care charity which he set up in her memory after she died of cancer in 1991.

Apt choice: The Duchess of Cornwall arrives in tartan for the opening of a new Maggie's cancer centre in Aberdeen

Royal protocol: The Duchess curtseys as she greets the Queen of Norway

Similar taste in clothes: The royal pair, both in dresses and blazers, were given a tour of the centre

Known as the Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, Camilla donned a green Roy
Allen Lord of the Isles tartan dress and blazer for her visit. While 
it's usually the Duchess of Cambridge who is known for her style 
credentials, Camilla's look is on trend with numerous designers 
featuring tartan and window-pane check in their London Fashion Week 
shows recently.

Camilla teamed her patriotic outfit with beige shoes and a matching handbag and accessorised with a string of pearls round her neck.

Mother's legacy: Golfer Colin Montgomerie, who set up Maggie's cancer support in memory of his late mother helped to show the Duchess around

Warm welcome: The Duchess meets children who attended the opening

Gifts: Flowers were given to the two royals by Leigh Bonthrone, 15, and Jemma Findlay, eight, whose families have been affected by cancer

Meanwhile, Queen Sonja wore a similar outfit of a blazer and dress but opted for less colourful shades of grey and pale blue with stripes instead of checks, accessorised with a chunky silver necklace.

Camilla curtsied to the Queen as they greeted one another before being given a tour of the new building, which they first saw plans for during a previous meeting in Oslo. 

Two girls, Leigh Bonthrone, 15, and Jemma
Findlay, eight, whose families have been affected by cancer presented 
bouquets to the Duchess and Queen.

Proud patron: Camilla said she was delighted with what the charity have achieved with the new centre

Camilla said of the charities support centres: 'These places are the most uplifting places you could ever be, and you come out feeling better'

Camilla has been president of the cancer charity since 2008 and has visited many of its 17 centres.

Today she met Maggie’s staff, supporters and fundraisers, and unveiled a commemorative stone to mark the event. They also broke a Kransekake, a Norwegian celebration cake, to mark the opening.

Addressing guests, Camilla, said: 'As a
very, very proud patron of Maggie’s, I just want to thank everyone here
today for everything they have done to make this building so special.

'These places are the most uplifting places you could ever be, and you come out feeling better.

'That
is surely the point of Maggie’s. You see so many smiling faces and that
is what you want if you’re facing this terrible disease.'

Commemorative: The Duchess made a speech as she unveiled a plaque

Montgomerie and his family members also attended the event.

Montgomerie said: 'The opening of the centre is a very special day for myself and my family and I want to thank everyone involved in making this dream a reality.'

Earlier, the Duchess and Queen Sonja spent time talking with Leigh, from Kirkcaldy, Fife, whose father recovered from cancer, and Jemma, of Aberdeen, who lost her mother to the disease.

Leigh said: 'The Duchess was asking about how Maggie’s can support people. I told her how the centres had helped my family and how much one was needed here in Aberdeen.'
