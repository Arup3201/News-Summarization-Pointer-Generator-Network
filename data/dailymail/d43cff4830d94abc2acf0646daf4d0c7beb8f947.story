Identified: This photo provided by the California Department of Motor Vehicles shows Alan Oliver Frazier, named as the Reno gunman

Officials in Nevada have identified the suspect in Tuesday's deadly hospital shooting as 51-year-old California resident Alan Oliver Frazier.

Frazier is accused of killing a doctor and wounding two other people before turning a 12-gauge shotgun on himself inside Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno.

On Wednesday, investigators converged on Frazier's one-story home in Lake Almanor in Plumas County, California - some two hours northwest of Reno. Officers executed a search warrant at the alleged shooter's home on Evergreen Circle in the hopes of discovering some clues or information on his relatives.  

Police were able to identify Frazier and locate his home after running the license plate number on a GMC pickup truck that was abandoned in the parking lot of the Center for Advanced Medicine in Reno.

Frazier's neighbor Mike Hawthorne recalled to Reno Gazette Journal that the last time he saw the man alive, the 51-year-old told him 'he wasn't coming back.'

Mr Hawthorne's wife, Jeannette, described the gunman as an avid hunter and fisherman who enjoyed playing with his dog and was a good neighbor.

During snowstorms, Mrs Hawthorne said, Frazier would plow everyone’s driveways with his Bobcat.

While police are still looking for a motive behind the crime, people who knew Frazier believe the shooting may be related to a medical procedure he had undergone in Reno.

Neighbors Bob and Jan Hammill had 
known Frazier for 20 years. According to the couple, the man suffered 
from medical complications following a surgery performed on him a few 
years ago.

It remains 
unknown if either of the two doctors shot Tuesday had treated Frazier in
 the past. So far, detectives have been unable to establish a 
relationship between Frazier and the three victims: two physicians and a
 relative of a patient.  

The Hammills said that Frazier used to work at a wood-burning power plant that closed two years ago.

‘He’s a very good man and I’m shocked he hurt other people,’ Mrs Hammill told the paper.

Officials
 from the local sheriff's department said that over the past decade, 
they were called to Frazier's address twice: once for a disturbance, and
 the second time for an act of vandalism targeting the homeowner. 

Police believe Frazier was on a mission of violence when he entered a third-floor urology office and opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun after warning patients and their children in a waiting area to ‘get out.’

Charles G. Gholdoian, 46, was shot and killed at the scene. His colleague Dr. Christine Lajeunesse and a visitor to the hospital, Shawntae Spears, 20, were each shot once, but survived.

As Spears and Lajeunesse try to recover in the very hospital where they were shot, police have undertaken an investigation of the unnamed gunman, who motive eludes them thus far.

‘But the fact the shooter went through
 the first and second floor, made his way to the third floor of the 
building, would indicate to me it is not a random event,’ said Reno 
Deputy Police Chief Mac Venzo.

A
 witness who was among those the shooter passed in the waiting room said
 Wednesday that Frazier could have killed many more 
people at the Reno medical complex if that was his intent.

Detectives
 have not been able to establish any relationship the man may have had 
with the two doctors and the relative of a patient who were shot Tuesday
 before the gunman killed himself.

‘While
 we piece this thing together, we are trying to figure out what that 
relationship is, if there is a relationship at all,’ said Chief Mac 
Venzo.

Innocent victim? Lajeunesse is a urologist at Urology Nevada and remained listed in critical condition on Wednesday as police struggled to determine why a still unnamed Northern California man burst into her department and shot up the place before killing himself

Gholdoian, a 
urologist at Urology Nevada within the Center for Advanced Medicine on 
the campus of the Renown Regional Medical Center was killed at the 
scene.

‘Urology Nevada 
is shocked and saddened by the events that occurred,’ the medical center
 said in a statement. ‘At this time we have no information as to why 
these terrible events occurred, and we are cooperating with the 
authorities in every way possible to learn more.’

Dr.
 Michael Morkin, an emergency room surgeon and the incoming chief of 
staff at Renown, where the victims were taken, said both doctors were 
his friends. He described them as ‘exceptional physicians.’

‘It is a very difficult time for the medical community,’ he told reporters.

Spears' condition improved Wednesday from critical to serious, the hospital said.

Friends told Reno Gazette Journal the mother of two was in good spirits Wednesday and wrote on Facebook, ‘I am OK. Message me if you want to visit.’

‘She has two little boys and she so enjoys being a mom,’ said Spears' friend Denna Tinnin Klink.

Lajeunesse was conscious Wednesday but remained in critical condition at Renown, hospital officials said.

Police were withholding the name of the killer because they said they still have not been able to reach his next of kin.

'I am OK': Spears has two sons and friends say she is a deeply devoted mother. Thankfully, it appears she'll be reunited with her boys very soon

No connection? Police had yet to find a connection between the victims including Spears (left) and the unnamed shooter, who was a resident of the Northern California town of Lake Almanor

Plumas County Sheriff Greg Hagwood said Frazier was a long-time resident of the community of Lake Almanor and lived alone.

‘Part
 of the investigation and service of the search warrant was to help 
identify next of kin,’ Hagwood told AP, adding that authorities have 
established he has California relatives outside of Plumas County. He 
said investigators were ‘taking every measure possible to make 
notification of family as quickly as they can so they're not watching 
the news and having the unsettling experience of finding out that way.’

Police said there were about 100 people in the office building when authorities were alerted at 2.05pm Tuesday about an ‘active shooter.’

Venzo said investigators have talked to 29 witnesses, with more interviews pending.

Vitalis Ozoude, a state auditor, was in the reception area of Urology Nevada with his wife and 3-year-old son waiting for his child's appointment when the gunman walked in and eventually told them and others to leave.

‘I don't think he meant to kill everybody because if he did he had ample opportunity to do that,’ Ozoude told AP. He said the dozen or so people in the waiting room didn't immediately react to the sight of a man carrying the gun because he seemed calm.

‘He looked like he belonged. I thought he worked there, and he was just getting a gun from his car or taking it to his office,’ he said.

Vicki Green, another patient who said she was standing within an arm's length of the shooter at one time, said he ‘seemed calm, yet agitated at the same time.’

‘He started swinging the gun and telling everybody in the waiting room, `You need to get out, you better get out, you should get out,'‘ Green told KRNV-TV. ‘People started picking up their stuff and their kids and running.’

Venzo said the gunman went past the front desk at the urologist's office and entered the patient examination rooms.

Moving through the exam area, Frazier fired at least four rounds from the shotgun, striking the three victims, before making his way back to the office's waiting area and turning the gun on himself, police said.

The shooting comes nearly two months after a 12-year-old boy opened fire at an area middle school, killing a math teacher before killing himself. Two victims from that attack were treated at Renown Regional.

The medical center also has treated 
victims of other recent tragedies, including a crash at a Reno air race 
in 2011 that killed 11 people and a shooting rampage at a Carson City 
restaurant the same year that killed three uniformed Nevada National 
Guard members.
