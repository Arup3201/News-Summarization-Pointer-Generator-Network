Transgender convicts are set to get their own wing in an L.A. women's jail in what is believed to be an unprecedented move.

The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) will begin housing arrested transgender men and women in the city’s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) by the end of the month.

The announcement was made by Captain Dave Lindsay, commander of the department's jail division, in a speech to transgender people in Hollywood yesterday.

Transgender arrestees will be detained in a wing all their own at the women's Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) from the end of the month

One of the sections in the center, which houses male and female inmates, will be reserved for up to 24 transgender people.

It comes on the back of a new LAPD policy with new guidelines on interacting with members of the transgender community during stop and searches.

The policy was spelt out in a memo issued to all department personnel, telling officers to 'respect the expressed gender and do not question it'.

In the memo, it cautions officers to think twice before calling a member of the transgender community 'sir' or 'ma'am'. 

The memo also banned officers from frisking people or questioning them to solely learn their anatomical gender.

Capt. Lindsay claimed it 'is a major change' that will allow for 'an environment that's safe and secure, as there's been a history of violence against transgender people' in jail, according to the L.A. Times.

Karina Samala, director of the Transgender Working Group, which has been discussing changes in police policy and regulations with LAPD officials since 2007, said: 'We've pushed for this.'

City jails are designed for holding people until they appear in court to face the charges for which they were arrested - typically a maximum of three days.

They are then transferred to the LA County Jail, run by the Sheriff’s Department.

The planned changes do not apply to the county jail.

Up to now, transgender men and women arrested by LA police have been housed in the station closest to where they were arrested.

Biological men who identify and dress as women were housed with the male population, leaving them vulnerable to violence.

At the new module in the city, transgender people will have their own area and be able to receive male and female clothing and medical treatment, including hormones, Lindsay added.
