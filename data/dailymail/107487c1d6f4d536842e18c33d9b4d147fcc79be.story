A man has died after being knocked to the ground with a single punch by a stranger in a New York City square.

Jeffrey Babbitt, 62, had been left brain damaged after being punched in Union Square last week in an apparent racist attack.

Mr Babbitt died after allegedly being hit by Lashawn Marten, a 31-year-old African American, who reportedly said that he wanted to attack the next white person who walked by.

The 62-year-old, the sole carer of his 92-year-old mother Hedda, was hit so hard that he fell to the ground but later managed to stand. His condition deteriorated soon afterwards and he died at Bellevue Hospital.

Killed by a single punch: Jeffrey Babbitt, 62, has died at a New York City hospital after being left brain dead when he was punched by a stranger in an alleged racist hate crime

Charged: Lashawn Marten, 31, in custody in a police cruiser He allegedly stood up from a chess table in Union Square Park, said 'I'm going to knock out the next white person who walks by' and assaulted Jeffrey Babbitt

His mother Mrs Babbitt, who the retired train 
conductor shared a Brooklyn apartment with, had been at his hospital's 
bedside since Wednesday.

Two other white men, aged 48 and 18, 
suffered minor injuries after allegedly being attacked by Marten as they
 tried to help Mr Babbitt who was lying on the ground.

Footage of the aftermath of the assault shows the victim on the ground, with blood pouring from his head.

Marten, who has a previous criminal record and uses various aliases, was charged with assault and is due in a Manhattan court on Tuesday. It is likely his charges will now be upgraded.

According to one female witness last week, Marten said: 'The next white person who 
walks by I’m going to f***'.

She added: 'His fist went in 
and the man’s head bobbed and he hit the ground and you could hear his 
skull hitting the ground.'

Michael Benson, who also saw that attack, told ABC Local: 'The
 guy got agitated for some reason or another and he said, "The 
next white person that bumps into me without saying excuse me, I'm going
 to knock him out".'

After his racist rant and attack, witnesses said Marten stayed at the park and waited for police to arrive.

Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said 
Marten's alleged comments about targeting white people before allegedly 
punching Mr Babbitt could lead to hate crime charges being made against 
him.

'Our Hate Crimes Task Force is involved in aspects of that case,' he added.

Marten is being held on a $1 million bond as police decide whether to also charge him with a hate crime.
