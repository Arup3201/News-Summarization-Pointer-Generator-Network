A couple who had their first date at a theme park nine years ago have got engaged at the foot of their favourite ride.

Stephen Kelly, 25, surprised his girlfriend Danielle Manton, 25, by popping the question at Thorpe Park - where they have visited on her birthday every year since their first date when they were seventeen.

Danielle was stunned when Stephen got down on one knee at the bottom of their favourite ride - Nemesis Inferno - surrounded by her closest friends and family.

Stephen says of his choice of venue: 'Thorpe Park is such a special place for us, it just felt right to do it then and there'

Stephen and Danielle had their very first date at Thorpe Park at the tender age of 17 having met in college

The couple from Poole, Dorset, met in psychology class at school and bonded over their love of roller-coasters.

Eventually 17-year-old Danielle plucked up courage to ask Stephen to visit Thorpe Park with her for her birthday.

Danielle, who has two daughters with Stephen, said: 'I met Stephen at school and instantly fell in love with him - I really wanted to ask him on a date, but didn't have a clue how to do it, or where to go.

'I suggested Thorpe Park, my favourite place in the world and he said yes, I was so excited I could hardly contain myself - we arranged to go for my birthday.

Danielle, pictured with Stephen on their first date, both aged 17, said she fancied him from the moment they met

'I spent the car journey with my stomach in knots, not because I was scared of the coasters, but because I was sat next to him.

'We arrived, and the first ride we went on was Nemesis Inferno - we got together at the end of that day - just after riding Nemesis Inferno for the last time.'

Since that day the couple have returned to the park on the 11th of May every year, now with their two daughters, Bella, four and Connie, eight-months-old.

Stephen, who waited until he had completed his apprenticeship as a carpenter before proposing, planned the stunt in secret and invited the couple's closest friends and family to meet them as they came off the ride.

Stephen said: 'Danielle had no idea at all, I've been waiting so long to propose - it had to be in the right place at the right time.

The family now make their annual pilgrimage to Thorpe Park together, and Bella even helped her father with the proposal

'I thought about doing it at the theatre, but Thorpe Park is such a special place for us, it just felt right to do it then and there.

'My daughter was there and she told Danielle to close her eyes and open her hands, when she opened her eyes I was down on one knee.'

Stephen and Danielle are now hoping to hold their wedding reception at the park - which nine years later remains one of their favourite places.

Danielle said: 'I fell pregnant with my first daughter Bella when I was still at university and it was really hard - without my great friends and Stephen I wouldn't have been able to get through it.

'We have always struggled with money and being able to afford to get engaged is a massive step for us.

'When Stephen proposed I couldn't believe this amazing thing was happening - we are both incredibly happy and excited to get married.'

A spokesperson for Thorpe Park said: 'We were thrilled to hear that Thorpe Park has played such a romantic part in Danielle and Steve's engagement and we're speaking to them about their wedding day plans and a honeymoon in our new Thorpe Park hotel.'
