Similing as they come face to face with some of nature's most dangerous predators, these visitors to a controversial zoo can cuddle up to lions and tigers without fearing they might not live to tell the tale.

Even the most feared mammals appear no scarier than a domestic cat at Argentina's Lujan Zoo, where animals are raised alongside dogs and are used to human contact.

Since it opened in 1994 there has not been a single report of an attack, although many critics of the zoo believe that this record has been achieved through drugging the animals.

Domesticated: Officials also say that the animals are raised alongside dogs, and learn to mimic the domestic pets' friendliness towards people

Although in their natural habitat the big cats such as lions and tigers would be feared, these creatures don't seem to mind the tourists cosying up to them for a photograph, and even young children are allowed to pet them.

The zoo claims that the animals are so passive and friendly because they are so well-fed that they would have no cause to ever think of humans as food.

Lethargic? Some animal rights groups say the creatures have been sedated

New start: Many of the animals at the zoo are said to be former illegal house pets, offered to the zoo after they have outgrown their homes

The zoo has been criticised by some visitors and animal rights groups who say that the creatures seem lethargic - as if they had been drugged, according to Atlas Obscura.

However, keepers maintain that if they animals were sedated to the extent suggested the drugs would kill them.

As well as bears, tigers and lions the zoo holds two female elephants, a wide variety of reptiles and birds.
