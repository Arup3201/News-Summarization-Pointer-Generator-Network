A conservationist embroiled in a multi-million pound court battle with her estranged husband over funds from the charity they set up with the aim of saving endangered Chinese tigers had become 'blinded by her desire for revenge', a judge has said.

Sir Paul Coleridge, sitting in the Family Division of the High Court in London, said that desire had led Li Quan - a 'very intelligent person' - to 'fabricate where she thinks it will assist her case'.

The judge was giving his findings in a round of a legal fight between Ms Li, a Chinese conservationist, and former banker Stuart Bray - who are both in their 50s and live in London, which followed the collapse of their marriage.

Ms Li told the judge during proceedings earlier this year that money put into the Save China's Tigers charity was used to fund their personal lives.

Li Quan claimed that money put into the Save China's Tigers charity was used to fund the personal lives of her and her husband former banker Stuart Bray. A divorce judge said she was 'blinded by her desire for revenge'

The judge said Li Quan was 'passionate' about not only saving the Chinese tiger from 'disappearing from the planet altogether'

Mr Bray, who comes from America and used to work for Deutsche Bank, hotly disputed her case that a trust was established not only to advance the cause of the tigers, but also to provide financial benefit and support for the husband and wife personally over the long term.

In a written ruling, Sir Paul said today that there was 'no evidence of past, present or future benefit to the parties'.

He said the trust has assets 'which are worth tens of millions of dollars or pounds'.

The precise figure 'is far from agreed, but on the most optimistic view not more than £25m, but there are now almost no assets, relatively speaking, outside it'.

The judge added: 'Accordingly, the determination of this preliminary issue necessarily has a profound impact on the wife's claim.'

The couple lived together from 1997, marrying in 2001. In 2000 Ms Li established Save China's Tigers in the UK. File picture

Giving the background to the case, the judge said the wife was 'passionate' about not only saving the Chinese tiger from 'disappearing from the planet altogether', but also breeding them for reintroduction into wild reserves in China - the Chinese tiger (panthera tigris amoyensis) no longer exists in the wild.

He added: 'To that end she has invested huge amounts of time and energy and some money.'

She met Mr Bray in 1990 and 'he too, over time, became infected with the same passion for the cause of saving the Chinese tiger'.

The judge said: 'And he too has invested even greater sums of money in the venture, loosely and frequently described as the Chinese Tiger Project, and a great deal of his time and energy.'

The couple lived together from 1997, marrying in 2001. In 2000 Ms Li established Save China's Tigers in the UK (SCT UK), which secured UK Charity Commission registration the following year.

'Between that time and July 2012 the husband and wife worked tirelessly and more or less cooperatively on this patently bold, imaginative, charitable and laudable venture', said the judge.

Sir Paul continued: 'The wife's expertise in the field of tiger conservation and her Chinese contacts and cultural background combined with the husband's profound understanding of, and experience in, complicated international finance and financial structures undoubtedly produced a dynamic partnership.'

But he said: 'Tragically for all involved the personal relationship of the wife and husband deteriorated over time. Part of the problem seems to have been disagreements over the future policy and precise presentation of the project.'

Sir Paul said that in July 2012 the wife was removed as director of SCT UK and the following month filed a divorce petition.

He said: 'From the word go the wife has been beside herself with grief and anger at the way that she has been unjustifiably, as she sees it, removed from SCT UK and the Tiger project which she has always seen as 'her baby'.

'She has gone as far as saying that if she cannot lead the project she would rather it was destroyed.

'She has since her departure set up another charity with similar objectives and which the husband believes is an attempt to try and usurp SCT UK's function.'

The judge said he was 'driven' to find 'overall' that 'she is an unreliable witness upon whom the court cannot rely'.

That was 'especially so' when it came to deciding where the 'truth lies' about the underlying purpose of the trust 'and any discussion which took place at the time of its creation'.

Sir Paul said: 'The wife is a very intelligent person but she has become blinded by her desire for revenge and this has led her to fabricate where she thinks it will assist her case.'

He said that in contrast, he found the husband's evidence 'bore all conventional hallmarks of honesty and accuracy'. 

In a statement issued after the decision, Ms Li said: 'I am surprised and disappointed by the now retired judge's decision.

'I want to ask the Court of Appeal to right this wrong.

'It is a terrible precedent. However as there will probably be an appeal, I am advised that it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further at this time.'
