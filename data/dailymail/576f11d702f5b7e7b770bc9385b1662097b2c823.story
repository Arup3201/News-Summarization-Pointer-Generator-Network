A two-year-old California boy who was born paralyzed from the waist down has been denied a wheelchair from his parent's insurance company.

Aubrey and Joe Allred, the parents of toddler Crue, said they wanted their son to have a new wheelchair, however Anthem Blue Cross refused to grant him one because he is too young. 

Aubrey said she was also told her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old.

Crue, who was born with spina bifida, currently gets around in a $1,100 ZipZac, which is a miniature wheelchair that is low to the ground and often gets stuck on cracks in the sidewalk.

Aubrey, 29, a mother-of-two, said she is heartbroken because she believes her son should have the freedom to be independent,  according to Fox News.

The family submitted a claim for a wheelchair which was rejected in October. They resubmitted the claim which was also rejected a few weeks ago.

On March 3, Aubrey wrote on Facebook that the claim had been denied.

She wrote: 'I know that our son is only two but his mobility shouldn't be determined by a doctor that works for the insurance company, who has never met him. 

'Crue is such an amazing and determined little boy and is capable of a lot more than they think. I don't know where he would be without his little ZipZac chair. That chair has given him his own independence and the ability to explore and learn on his own. 

'He's been using that chair for almost two years now (no thanks to the insurance). I just wish that insurance companies would understand that if they gave young disabled children the chance to have mobility at a young age, the difference they'd be making in their lives. 

'An able child learns to walk at the age of one so why is it not okay for a young disabled child to learn to use a chair at the age of two?'

Anthem Blue Cross has said the child's doctor is at fault for not submitting the required documents ahead of the legal deadline.

'Our records reflect that claim was denied because their doctor, despite efforts by Anthem to obtain this information, did not provide necessary documentation before the legal deadline to process a claim expired,' Darrel Ng, spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross told Fox News. 

The insurance company also said the family can appeal the decision that the chair is not necessary for Crue, according to ABC.

The toddler's parents plan to appeal the decision and keep fighting for their son.

Aubrey began sharing her son's story on Facebook, which led a close friend of theirs to start a donation page to help raise funds so that Crue could have a new wheelchair.

As their friend, Chanda Clark Steggell, was only intending to raise $10,000, by Saturday $15,995 had been raised in donations.

Now Crue will also be able to have a standing walker and standing wheelchair.

The donations will also help with many other of his other medical needs that are incurred on both a weekly and monthly basis.

Since Aubrey shared her son's story on Facebook, which led a close friend to help raise nearly $16,000 by Saturday. Now Crue will get a new wheelchair, as well as a standing walker and a standing wheelchair (above the Facebook post thanking people for generous donations)

Aubrey said she gets teary-eyed thinking about all of the donations, and that she along with Joe are determined to show Crue that he can do whatever he wants in life (above Aubrey and Joe)

'This little boy is beyond shocked and so grateful for all the donations he has gotten,' a recent Facebook post said. 'He just wants to thank each and every one of you for all you love, support, prayers, and kind words.

'We are truly blessed to have such amazing people in our lives.'

Aubrey said she gets teary-eyed thinking about all of the donations, and that she along with Joe are determined to show Crue that he can do whatever he wants in life.
