 Ever the supportive and dutiful girlfriend, Kim Sears was once again courtside last night to watch boyfriend of eight years Andy Murray take on German Matthias Bachinger on day four of the US Open.

The 25-year-old artist chose a pretty cream chiffon dress with a colourful bird design, which showed off her tanned, lean legs.

Clutching her new favourite £500 Milli Millu tote, having forsaken the Aspinal of London Marylebone bag she carried throughout Wimbledon, Kim looked tense as she entered the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York.

Kim looked rather miserable, despite Andy's success on court

Despite Murray winning in straight sets, Kim’s mood didn’t seem to lift much, with her face remaining as poker-straight as her hair as she watched Andy win 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in one hour and 46 minutes.

With her heavy eye make-up only serving to emphasis her glum expression, Kim barely cracked a smile.

The young Briton was similarly sullen watching Murray beat Robin Haase of the Netherlands on Tuesday.

Andy won against German Matthias Bachinger in straight sets - though you wouldn't know it from Kim's face 

Despite her mood, Kim's hair and make-up looked as immaculate as ever 

Kim became famous during Wimbledon for her animated and emotional courtside support, but this passion seems to have cooled somewhat since arriving in the US.

Murray will no doubt be hoping that his girlfriend's mood improves before he plays against Andrey Kuznetsov tomorrow.

The Scottish tennis star, 27, has famously praised her ability to gauge when he needs company and when he wants to be alone as ‘fundamental’ to their relationship.

He said: ‘Kim sees all of the emotions when I win or lose a match, she can tell how I’m really feeling.’
