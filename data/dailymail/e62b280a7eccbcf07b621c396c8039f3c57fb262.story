The man poised to become Pakistan's next prime minister has pledged to help Nato forces withdraw from Afghanistan safely next year by allowing them to use his country's roads to move troops and equipment.

Nawaz Sharif, who is facing renewed allegations of vote rigging after video purporting to show election officials in Karachi stuffing ballot boxes with votes, said he thought Pakistan had a good relationship with the USA.

But he described the CIA's ongoing drone campaign in the country's tribal region as a challenge to national sovereignty.

Pledge: Nawaz Sharif, who is poised to become Pakistan's next Prime Minister, said he would allow Nato forces to use Pakistan's roads to withdraw safely from Afghanistan next year

In a press statement given at his opulent villa near Lahore, Mr Sharif said: 'American troops are being withdrawn in 2014. We will extend full support to them. We will see that everything goes well and smoothly.' 

The U.S. is reliant on Pakistan for help in neighboring Afghanistan, where it will likely play a strong role in any reconciliation deal with Taliban militants.

Much of the American military equipment that must be shipped out of Afghanistan when the international coalition there ends its combat mission in 2014 will go through the port city of Karachi in southern Pakistan.

It comes as fresh allegations of vote-rigging were being aimed against Sharif’s PML-N party after video emerged appearing to show election officials stuffing ballot boxed with votes.

A video released by the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, which finished fourth winning just ten seats, allegedly shows several women stuffing stacks of papers into ballot boxes at a polling station in Karachi.

The video is one of several that have been aired on Pakistani television purporting to show evidence of vote rigging

One of the women in the grainy video smiles towards the camera and puts a finger to her lips, appearing to make a 'be quiet' gesture.

It is one of several videos purporting to show vote-rigging which have been airing on Pakistani television news channels following Saturday's result.

On Monday Munsif Ali Khan, an independent candidate from Pakistan's remote tribal areas, presented a mobile phone video to journalists showing ballot papers scattered on the ground near a polling station with sound of gunfire heard in the background.

Despite the allegations, Sharif, a devout Muslim and a populist, is expected to supplant President Asif Ali Zardari as the international face of Pakistan following his party's resounding victory in Saturday's election.

The 63-year-old Sharif often hit out at the U.S. in statements while lobbying for votes, and he accused the outgoing government ruled by the Pakistan People's Party of selling out the country's sovereignty in exchange for U.S. aid.

However, analysts have cautioned that while such rhetoric sells on the campaign trail in a country where anti-American sentiment is high, Sharif is likely to take a more nuanced approach to U.S. relations once in office.

'I think we have good relations with the United States of America. We certainly have to listen to each other,' said Sharif. 'If there are any concerns on any side, I think we should address those concerns.'

Sticking point: Mr Sharif described the CIA's ongoing drone campaign in the country's tribal region as a challenge to national sovereignty

Pakistan and the U.S. have had an extremely fraught relationship in recent years, especially following the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden in a Pakistani army town in 2011. The U.S. didn't tell Pakistan about the operation beforehand, and the government was outraged at the breach of its sovereignty.

Even before the raid, the U.S. accused Pakistan of supporting Taliban militants who use the country's rugged northwest tribal region to launch cross-border attacks against American troops in Afghanistan - allegations denied by Islamabad.

The relationship has improved somewhat over the last year, but U.S. drone attacks targeting Taliban and al-Qaida militants in Pakistan's tribal region continue to create serious friction between the two countries.

The strikes are extremely unpopular in Pakistan, where many people believe they mostly kill innocent civilians - something Washington denies.

'Drones indeed are challenging our sovereignty,' said Sharif. 'I think this is a very serious issue, and our concern must be understood properly.'

But Pakistan has a long history of 
officials condemning the strikes in public and supporting them in 
private, and how aggressively Sharif pushes the U.S. may depend on how 
much he needs it in other areas.

Pakistan
relies on the U.S. for hundreds of millions of dollars in aid every 
year. More importantly, Pakistan would likely need U.S. support to get a
bailout it desperately needs from the International Monetary Fund 
because of the government's shaky financial situation.

Sharif spoke with reporters at his palatial estate in the rural town of Raiwind near the eastern city of Lahore.

The
estate is filled with acres of plush lawns and manicured gardens, where
scores of majestic peacocks roam freely. The inside of his house is 
opulently decorated in a style reminiscent of Louis XIV and features two
stuffed lions - the symbol of Sharif's party - at the entrance to his 
living room.

Sharif's 
supporters believe his pro-business background and years of experience 
in government make him the right person to tackle the country's many 
economic woes, like growing power cuts, painful inflation and widespread
unemployment.

His stance on reining in violent Islamic extremism, however, remains uncertain.

Critics have accused his Pakistan Muslim League-N party of being soft on radicals because it hasn't cracked down on militant groups in its stronghold of Punjab province.

Even if Sharif wanted to shut down the U.S. drone program, he would have to contend with the wishes of the Pakistani army, which is considered the strongest institution in the country and often plays a dominant role in national security issues.

The army is known to have supported the drone program in the past. That cooperation has decreased over time as the relationship between the two countries has deteriorated.

Many analysts believe there is still grudging acceptance of the strikes - both because of U.S. aid and because of the harm it would do to the relationship if Pakistan really put its foot down.

The number of strikes targeting militants has dropped from a peak of more than 120 in 2010 to close to a dozen so far this year, but it's unclear how much this trend has been driven by U.S. decisions about targeting versus the political sensitivity of carrying out strikes.
