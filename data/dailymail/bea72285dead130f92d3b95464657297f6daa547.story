Manchester United have been paired against League Two outfit Cambridge United in the draw for the fourth round of the FA Cup. 

Louis van Gaal side's will travel to Abbey Stadium in late January as the Dutchman aims to end United's 11-year wait to get their hands on the FA Cup. 

The Red Devils progressed to the third round with a 2-0 win against League One side Yeovil Town and they have been handed another away trip to a Football League outfit.

January's clash at the Abbey Stadium will see ex-Manchester United midfielder Luke Chadwick face his former side. 

Elsewhere, holders Arsenal will travel down to the south coast to take on Chris Hughton's Brighton after defeating fellow 2014 FA Cup finalists Hull City at the weekend. 

Southampton will host Crystal Palace in one of two potential all-Premier League ties of the round if they can eliminate Ipswich Town in a replay at Portman Road.

The only other all-Premier League tie will see Burnley or Tottenham face Premier League strugglers Leicester.

One of the ties of the round could be an all-London affair between Chelsea and Millwall if Ian Holloway's side can win their replay against Bradford. 

New West Brom manager Tony Pulis will be hoping he can win his first derby match since taking over the reins at The Hawthorns when his side travel to St Andrew's to take on Birmingham. 

Emile Heskey will make a return to Anfield following Liverpool's win at AFC Wimbledon.

The draw was made by Lawrie Sanchez and local grassroots football coach Stef Loucaides at the Cherry Red Records Stadium before Liverpool's third round match against AFC Wimbledon. 

Following Everton's 1-1 draw with West Ham at Goodison Park and Scunthorpe's 2-2 draw against Chesterfield on Tuesday night, both will be replayed a week later on January 13.
