A family proved to be four of a kind after quitting their day jobs to become card-playing poker champions.

Michelle and Matthew Shiels and their sons Richard and Brandon are all aces at the game, honing their skills at their 'house of cards' in Edington, Birmingham.

Only last week, 19-year-old Brandon scooped £9,200 in the UK and Ireland Poker Tour tournament, staged in London.

But former Birmingham University economics graduate Richard, who did his dissertation on the game, has gone one better.

The 23-year-old scooped £27,000 in the Deep Stack contest, staged at Nottingham's Dusk Till Dawn Poker Club.

For 24 hours, Richard battled with 328 of the best players in the country, and came out on top.

In fact, between them, Brandon and Richard have made a whopping £75,000 since November.

As a family, the Sheils take part, on average, in three competitions a week - and they claim there is a reason for their staggering success.

Guided by 48-year-old Matthew, a former accountant, and Michelle, who sold her nursery business to concentrate on poker, they say they have replaced the luck, chance and risk with a mathematical formula.

Richard, who began playing in earnest after leaving university in 2012, said: 'In our house, there is a fine line between gambling and poker.

'I did my dissertation on poker, the science and maths behind the game. You can see where the gambling is, and where it is not.

'It would be extremely silly to go down the gambling route. If you meet gamblers, you are going to make money from them.'

But Richard admitted you can't completely eradicate luck.

'If I played you 100 times, I wouldn't beat you 100 times,' he explained, 'but I would beat you more than 50 times, which would mean I'd make money.'

Richard, who spent two months playing the Vegas tables, was introduced to cards at a very early age. He learned to count using a deck.

'Old school poker is very touchy-feely,' he said, 'but nowadays it's all about the maths and theory. Mind you, when we're in a tournament together it becomes very competitive.

'I'm getting better and better. At the moment, I'm a better player than Brandon, but he's improving all the time. I taught him how to play.. I've made the mistakes and made sure he doesn't make them.

'My ambition is to be good enough to play for a living, but rich enough not to have to.'

Michelle and Matthew are no slouches and have appeared in tournaments on satellite television.

'Mum ran a nursery,' Richard explained. 'She sold that, semi-retired and played poker. She's been on Channel 4's Late Night Poker a few times, and her biggest win is £12,000.'

Michelle, 41, said: 'Richard and Brandon are better players, to be fair.

I'm always asked if I'm better than my husband and he says I am, but I'm not sure.

'I have no fixed plans for the future. Sometimes I get bored with it and go off the boil, then return.'
