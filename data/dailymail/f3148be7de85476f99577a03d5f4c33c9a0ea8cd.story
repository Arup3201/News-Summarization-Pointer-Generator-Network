Gamers have waited for years for a Metal Gear Solid title to arrive.
And just as patience was beginning to wane, two come along.

Metal Gear Solid V is composed of both Ground Zeroes and The Phantom
pain. Ground Zeroes takes place after the events of the previous Peace Walker
game - acting as a prologue to The Phantom Pain.This, in turn, takes place nine years after the Big Boss falls
into a coma.

Welcome back: The latest game uses the in-house Fox Engine allowing Snake to be rendered better than ever

Powered by Kojima-Productions’ Fox Engine, the game follows Big Boss
and McDonnell Miller investigating an organisation called the XOF – who are responsible
for destroying the Mother Base.

Although the gameplay trailer initially looked beyond current
generation hardware, the Fox Engine is capable of running on both Xbox and PS3. There has been no word yet on what next-gen platforms the games will be available on.

Although details are being kept under wraps, Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima has
described The Phantom Pain as an open world game – giving the player more
choice than ever before.

Fan-favourite David Hayter, however, will not be featuring in the games. Speaking to the website Gamestrailers, Kojima didn't involve Hayter because he wants to create a 'completely new type of Metal Gear game'.  

Strange: On watching the gameplay video (below), expect to see imagery not yet seen in the series

Keifer Sutherland, who played Jack Bauer in 24, is speculated to be playing Snake.

Haytor is not the only long-standing voice actor to be replaced. Notably last year, Ubsisoft dropped Michael Ironside for the upcoming Splinter Cell: Blacklist. The 63-year-old voiced lead character, Sam Fisher, since the series' inception in 2002.

The Metal Gear games have sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, amassing widespread critical acclaim and awards in the process.

Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots was Snake's only outing on current gen hardware - bar HD remakes - while the spin-off, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, features Raiden as the main character. Both (especially the former) rank among the console's best-scored games.
