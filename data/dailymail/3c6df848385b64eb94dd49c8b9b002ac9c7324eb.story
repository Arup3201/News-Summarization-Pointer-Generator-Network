Toyota is recalling more than 6.5milllion cars spanning nearly 30 models - including 2.3 million in North America and 35,000 in the UK - after it discovered a number of faults.

The car manufacturer found in some models  airbags can deactivate, seats may move and steering columns could break, the company said today.

No injuries or crashes have been reported related to the recalls but two reports of fires are linked to one of the problems, a defective engine starter that can keep the motor running.

Mass recall: 35,000 Toyota vehicles, including the RAV4, have been found to have potentially dangerous faults

Faulty: The models involved include the Corolla, RAV4, Matrix, Yaris - one of which is pictured here, the Highlander, and Tacoma.

By region, the latest recall affects 2.3 million vehicles in North America, 1.09 million vehicles in Japan and 810,000 vehicles in Europe. Other regions affected by the recall include Africa, South America and the Middle East.

The models involved include the Corolla, 
RAV4, Matrix, Yaris, Highlander, and Tacoma. The Pontiac Vibe and the 
Subaru Trezia are also affected.

In some RAV4 and Hilux models, Toyota said there was a risk that the driver's airbag may be deactivated because turning the steering wheel could damage certain circuits, causing the airbag warning light on the instrument panel to illuminate. 

In some Toyota Yaris and Urban Cruiser models a spring mechanism locking the driver and, in three-door cars, the front passenger seats in position on the adjustment rails may be under-strength and could break if seats are frequently moved back and forwards. 

If the spring breaks, seats may not lock in position and could move in a crash, Toyota said.  

In the same models, a weld connecting the steering column bracket to the instrument panel might break when the steering wheel is repeatedly turned with full force, which could cause the steering column to tilt out of position. Drivers would not lose control of their vehicle.  

Toyota said customers would have their cars inspected and repaired free and urged people to check if their vehicle was affected by looking up its registration on the company website.

Toyota was embroiled in a massive recall crisis in the U.S. starting in late 2009 and continuing through 2010, covering a wide range of problems including faulty floor mats, sticky gas pedals and defective brakes.

Danger: Models including the Urban Cruiser are affected by a global Toyota recall after concerns were raised over airbag faults and fire risks

Last month, the Japanese automaker reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department to pay a $1.2 billion penalty for hiding information about defects in its cars. It earlier paid fines of more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration problems.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never found defects in electronics or software in Toyota cars, which had been targeted as a possible cause.

The Pontiac Vibe, which is a General Motors Co. model, is involved because Toyota and GM made cars at the same plant in California and the recalled model is the same as the Toyota Matrix.

Subaru is partly owned by Toyota, and the model was the same as the Toyota Ractis.
