Joran van der Sloot, who is currently serving 28 years in a Peruvian prison, is to be extradited to the U.S. in 2038 on charges of extortion and wire fraud relating to the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway. Van der Sloot is also a chief suspect in Holloway’s disappearance.

Natalee Holloway disappeared during a 2005 high school graduation trip to the Dutch Caribbean island of Aruba, where Van der Sloot lived. She was last seen leaving a bar with him.

Holloway's body was never found, and no charges were filed against Van der Sloot in the case. A judge later declared Holloway dead.

The date is a chilling one to the Holloway family, as it was five years to the day after the 18-year-old was last seen.

Never found: Natalee Holloway (right) disappeared during a 
2005 high school graduation trip to the Dutch Caribbean island of Aruba,
 where Van der Sloot lived

Victim: Van der Sloot is serving 28 years in prison after being convicted of killing Peruvian student Stephany Flores, 21, after meeting her in a Lima casino and going back to a hotel room

U.S. prosecutors allege Van der Sloot 
accepted $25,000 in cash from Holloway's family in exchange for a 
promise to lead a lawyer for the family to her body in early 2010, just 
before he went to Peru.

A 
decree published Sunday in Peru's official gazette says he will be 
extradited under an indictment in U.S. District Court in the state of 
Alabama.

Van der Sloot is 
serving 28 years in prison after being convicted of killing Peruvian 
student Stephany Flores, 21, after meeting her in a Lima casino and 
going back to a hotel room.

Investigators
 say they think van der Sloot killed Flores when she found something 
related to the Holloway case on his computer in the hotel, CNN reports. 

False hopes? U.S. prosecutors allege Van der Sloot accepted $25,000 in cash from Holloway's family in exchange for a promise to lead a lawyer for the family to her body in early 2010, just before he went to Peru

In 2010, he was charged with 
attempting to extort $250,000 from Natalee Holloway’s mom in return for 
details about her daughter’s death.

Van der Sloot took a $25,000 down payment and then traveled to Peru on May 14, 2010, 
a trip that ended with the murder of Miss Flores, whom he met in
 a Lima casino, on May 25.

He
 took cash and credit cards from Miss Flores before fleeing to Chile, 
where he was caught two days after her decaying body was found.

He
 confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after
 she found out about his suspected involvement in the Natalee Holloway 
case.

Reports had surfaced last year that Leydi Figueroa Uced was pregnant with Van der Sloot's child, although no reports of the baby's birth have ever been released

Miss Holloway's body has never been found 
and repeated searches turned up nothing as intense media coverage 
brought the case worldwide attention.

Together with a Dutch investigative 
journalist, Beth Holloway spoke to Van der Sloot in a Peruvian jail 
where admit to extortion, but not to the truth about what happened to 
her daughter.

Natalee Holloway was 17 when she disappeared on Aruba, the Dutch island in the southern Caribbean Sea, during a school trip.

Van der Sloot admitted to killing 
Flores, but blamed post traumatic stress disorder for being accused of 
Holloway’s disappearance for making him kill the Peruvian.

In prison letters released last July, Van der Sloot said hoped the Flores family could forgive him for his crimes.

'I ask God every day that Stephany's parents can find it in their heart to forgive me,' he wrote.

But he also made an attempt to paint himself as the victim.

He
 said he believed he was misled by his attorney when he pleaded 
guilty to Flores’ murder and that he suffers from ‘psychological’ problems that should have been weighed in the murder case.

Mr Van
 der Sloot wrote: 'My rights have been constantly abused. My lawyer 
promised me I would receive 15 years if I plead guilty, I did.'

He
 also referred to himself as a psychological 'mess' in the letters, 
which were written in English and contain numerous misspellings and 
grammatical errors.

'I have a history of psychological problems which were never taken into consideration,' he said.
