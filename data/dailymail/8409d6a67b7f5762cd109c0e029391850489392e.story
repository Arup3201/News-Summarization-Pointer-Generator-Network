A family has been left distraught after it was revealed four brothers slipped out of Australia last week to join the fight with the Islamic State in the Middle East.

As authorities attempt to contain home-grown terrorists  from leaving the country, the latest recruits from Western Sydney have been labelled 'cleanskins' by police agencies because they were completely unknown to intelligence.

It is thought that the four brothers made their way to Syria after they told their parents they were going on a trip to Thailand, according to the Daily Telegraph.

More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State

Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee on Thursday that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar', the Guardian reported.

'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police. 1

Authorities were alerted last Saturday when the family contacted a member of a local community after they failed to hear from their boys since they fled the country, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the family was seeking his help but unfortunately, it was too late.

'Australia has lost yet another four young kids. This is why we are so adamant in trying to prevent people leaving to join these foreign fighters', Mr Morrison told The Daily Telegraph.

It follows after 'ginger' jihadist Abdullah Elmir disappeared from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west in June and made his way to the Middle East.

The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video.

According to The Daily Telegraph, counter terrorism officers have been deployed to all Australian international airports.

This comes just days ahead of the G20 summit to be held in Brisbane, which will be attended by a large number of world leaders. 

Police commissioner Neil Gaughan also told the committee he believed that federal police officers needed greater controls urgently, so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects. 

Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised

'But the fact is there’s still people travelling and regardless of what we’re doing, we’re not stopping that so we need some other tools,' he said, according to The Telegraph.

Though he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled, Gaughan said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere.

'Unfortunately, once they get into Syria or into Iraq, there is nothing the AFP can do except wait for them to basically pop their head up somewhere on the way back.' 

Khaled Sharrouf is also fighting with IS militants in the Middle East, and made headlines when he posted a photo of his young son brandishing a severed head

Gaughan was speaking at an investigation into new legislation which aims to give security agencies power to issue control orders on people who are enabling or supporting terrorism.

He also revealed that authorities were struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people being radicalised in such a short time - often less than six months.

Authorities said the ability to put restrictions on who suspects can communicate with and where they can go would allow them to greatly reduce the change of an attack on home soil.
