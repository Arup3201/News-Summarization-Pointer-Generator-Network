'People really enjoy it': Medical student Maggie Rostron, 28, president of the Glasgow University Pole-Dancing Club, rejected claims of 'sexualisation'

Writhing semi-naked as they perform their raunchy routines, these young women look like  professional pole-dancers.

In fact, they are students at a leading Scots university, where undergraduates as young as 17 are taking part in the ‘sport’.

Dozens participated in the show, which was open to the public as well as students, and all paid a £5 entry fee.

Organisers say pole-dancing – once seen exclusively as a feature of strip bars – is increasingly popular among female students.

About 170 students are now members of a Glasgow University society dedicated to promoting the activity.

But last night the disclosure fuelled concern about the growing ‘sexualisation’ of teenage girls and young women on university campuses, while organisers admitted some parents had voiced concern.

Mike Judge, of the UK evangelical group Christian Institute, said: ‘This is not what parents would expect their daughters to be doing at university.

‘Those who fought for the right of women to go to university would be appalled by this club.

‘The pornification of our culture is forcing young women to do things many of them later regret. It’s yet more evidence of our hyper-sexualised society.’

Wednesday night’s show at Glasgow 
University students’ union, entitled Journey Through Time and Space, was
billed as a showcase of pole-dancing routines.

The
dancers performed to an audience of around 50, mainly made up of other 
students, though any member of the public was able to come and watch.

A
total of 62 students were involved in the show – 59 female and, perhaps
surprisingly, three male, all between the ages of 17 and 28. It 
involved a series of  routines on four poles – most were danced in 
groups but there were eight solo performances.

The outfits varied from cut-away backless leotards, to a gold bikini-style top and pants.

In a routine entitled The Swinging 
1960s, dancers wore small pink hot-pants and a see-through top with a 
pink bra underneath and performed moves such as doing the splits in the 
air whilst wrapped around the pole.

In another routine, The Roman Empire, nursing students stripped off togas and performed in black and gold pants and cropped tops.

The pole-dancing revelations come after a Safer Sex Ball  brought notoriety to Exeter University earlier this month, after footage of two revellers engaged in an intimate act was posted on the internet.

Female students in Exeter have also taken explicit images of themselves and uploaded them on to Facebook.

Some are naked from the waist up, their modesty barely protected by a bar bearing the words ‘Original Sin’, the name of the London-based events company that organises themed student parties at Exeter nightclubs.

Meanwhile, earlier this week, it 
emerged a website is offering cash-strapped female students at Scottish 
universities the chance to link up with ‘sugar daddies’ – strangers who 
will help to cover their university costs.

Medical student Maggie Rostron, 28, 
president of the Glasgow University Pole-Dancing Club, rejected claims 
of ‘sexualisation’ but admitted some parents had concerns.

She said: ‘People really enjoy it, as
it is a great sport that can be for everyone. It is fantastic for your 
fitness, which is why we have so many students who come along.

‘We run classes for all abilities and it is amazing to see what a confidence boost it gives people.

‘We
had girls performing in the show who have never done anything like this
before, but doing this has given them the confidence to get up on 
stage.

‘As a society, we 
also compete professionally in the sport and some of us have competed in
the UK Professional Pole Championships.

'The university has been really 
supportive of us since we began and we try to keep away from the stigma 
that is attached to pole exercise.

‘For us, it is a great physical workout 
that is a lot of fun and we’ve really established ourselves firmly as a 
sports club on campus.

really enjoy it, as it is a great sport that can be for everyone'

Maggie Rostron, 28, president of the Glasgow University Pole-Dancing Club

‘We have had problems with parents who are unhappy with it but we always encourage them to come along to a class and show them what our sport is about.’

Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, said it was wrong for the students’ union to allow ‘an activity with such dubious associations’ to take place on its premises.

He added: ‘It is certainly not something that most parents would want their daughters engaging in at university.’
