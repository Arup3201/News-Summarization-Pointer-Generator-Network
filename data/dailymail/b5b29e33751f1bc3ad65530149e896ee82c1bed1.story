The widow of radio icon Casey Kasem has been dumped by a second set of attorneys, the MailOnline can reveal.

According to documents filed with the Superior Court in Pierce County, Washington, Jean Kasem was let go by Seattle based law firm Ryan, Swanson and Cleveland.

The firm was representing Jean in a legal battle over her dead husband’s remains after Casey’s daughter Kerri blocked moves by Jean to have her father cremated.

This comes after another legal group last week dumped Jean and is suing the former actress for not paying their fees.

LA based Haney & Young claims it entered a contract on June 5 with Jean, who they allege ignored subsequent bills.

The firm represented her in the fight to keep Casey on life-support while he was in hospital.

According to TMZ the lawyers claim Jean rarely responds to their emails - and refuses to communicate by phone.

She's also ignored mounting fees against Casey's Estate which they say could end up totaling $500,000.

A private investigator hired by Casey’s daughter Kerri to investigate Jean said she is 'out-of-control' and rapidly losing support.

Logan Clarke told MailOnline: ‘Jean is out-of-control and has now been dumped by all of her attorneys, she’s flying without a plane.

‘She’s been playing games with the family and dragging them through court but she’s losing any support she had, soon she’ll be all alone.’

Casey Kasem passed away June 16 at the age of 82 following a battle with dementia and Lewy body disease.

His declining health sparked a bitter family feud over his care and treatment.

In October 2013, Kasem’s children with his former wife, actress Linda Myers, as well as Kasem’s brother and a business associate, went public.

The group held a protest outside Kasem’s home, alleging Jean wouldn’t let any of them see Casey and had been rebuffed in their efforts for three months.

In May 2014, Jean told a judge that Casey was no longer in the United States, however, he turned up several days later in Washington state.

On June 6, a Washington state court recognized the legal rights of Casey’s eldest children to see their father and gave daughter Kerri full conservator control of his affairs.

Haney & Young initially won a ruling on Jean’s behalf that same month, when a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered the legendary broadcaster to continue to be cared for at the Washington state hospital.

That decision was reversed two days later when the judge authorized Kerri to remove her father from life support.

Casey, the radio host of America's Top 40 and voice of animated television characters like Scooby-Doo's sidekick Shaggy, died June 15 at a hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington.

Kerri asked a Pierce County Superior Court judge for authorization to seek an autopsy on her father as well as a temporary restraining order to ensure his body was held in cold storage and not cremated until that autopsy is completed.

But since winning the order Kerri and the rest of the Kasem family have no clue where Casey’s body has been taken.

It’s believed it was moved from a funeral home in Washington to one in Montreal, Canada.

The Santa Monica police department is currently investigating claims of elder abuse against Casey in his final months.
