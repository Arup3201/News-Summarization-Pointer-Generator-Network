A woman whose nude photos were posted online by a bitter ex-boyfriend has spoken out about her struggle to remove the shots from the internet which cost her thousands of dollars.

Anisa Salmi, 27, found the images of her after a friend told her to type her name in Google.

The first page featured a link to The Dirty, a US site where users share naked pictures, and her intimate images were on the homepage.

Angry: Anisa Salmi, 27, was told she is to blame for the photos emerging as she consented to them

But despite going to the police in Richmond, Canada, Salmi was told she was to blame because she shared the photos with her former partner willingly.

She has now paid $2,000 to remove the shots from the internet but lawyers warn she will struggle to make a legal case against her ex under the current laws.

If she decided to sue on the grounds of defamation, cyberbullying, breach of privacy and a violation of copyright, the civil case could cost Salmi $30,000.

'I felt helpless,' the occupational therapist told The Vancouver Province.

'If anybody — an employer or client — were to Google my name and were to find these photos and the posts and the comments that were made about me, I felt it would jeopardize my integrity.'

Salmi's ordeal came at the same time celebrities' nude photos were leaked on the blogging site 4Chan.

Trauma: The occupational therapist has spent $2,000 taking the images offline to preserve her reputation

Legal holes: Criminal lawyer Deanne Gaffar said victims of image leaks are not properly protected by law

The America-based celebrities face the same legal struggles as Salmi: the offense is not a criminal one.

More than a dozen of the hacked stars are now suing Google for breach of copyright.

Criminal lawyer Deanne Gaffar, based in Vancouver, said: 'The problem that exists right now is there is a gap in the jurisdiction.

'In this day and age, with Internet and digital images which can be shared in a millisecond, you lose control over those things if you're placing the trust in someone else.'

Canada's House of Commons will soon debate a voyeurism bill which could give victims of hacking and leaked photos rights.

If Bill C-13 passed, it will criminalize the publication of intimate images without the consent of the subject of those images.
