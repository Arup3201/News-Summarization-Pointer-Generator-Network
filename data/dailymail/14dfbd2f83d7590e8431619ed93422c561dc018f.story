The BBC has spent £43,000 of licence fee payers' money on alcohol in the past year, new figures show.

The Corporation allows staff to buy alcohol with licence fee funds in order to treat presenters and guests. Drinks may also be bought for awards shows and to celebrate the completion of a series.

But the BBC insists that it aims to get value for money, mindful that it is public money being spent.

The £43,000 covers the 12 months to the end of October and is £1,000 higher than the previous year. It was all spent at Majestic Wine, the Corporation's favoured supplier. 

The amount is equal to the cost of nearly 300 colour television licence fees, priced at £145.50.

A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC has clear policies to ensure spend on hospitality is proportionate and we are always mindful that we are spending public money.

'Production teams do on occasion provide hospitality for guests and presenters.'

They added: 'Drinks may be purchased where there is an appropriate business purpose, for example at award ceremonies or to celebrate the successful completion of a series.

'The BBC has a rigorous expenses policy, which has been progressively tightening and we are careful to ensure value for money.'

The spending has been disclosed by the BBC in response to a Freedom Of Information Request.

The Corporation stated that the figure related to 'non-production related and production related spend'.

It added: 'The total spent on alcohol for the period 1st October 2013 to 26th October 2014 with the BBC's single preferred supplier Majestic Wine PLC was £43,000.'

It comes as up to 50 MPs called for the licence fee to be scrapped and replaced with a voluntary subscription service in its place.

The Tory politicians have written to Culture Secretary Sajid Javid arguing the licence fee is 'becoming unsustainable and out of keeping with the modern media environment.
