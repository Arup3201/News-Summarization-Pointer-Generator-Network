Fowl play: Seth Grim, 21, was arrested in West Virginia after he overturned his SUV containing up to 40 live chickens, weapons, ammunition and drugs  

Police responding to the scene of a car crash in West Virginia early Friday morning discovered weapons, altered fireworks, marijuana and dozens of live chickens inside a wrecked SUV.

The driver of the vehicle, 21-year-old Seth Grim, from Emmaus, Pennsylvania, has been charged with felony possession of marijuana with intent to deliver.

State Police spokesman Lt. Michael Baylous said additional charges were pending against Grim, who is being held on $25,000 bond.

The incident took place at around 3.30am Friday when officers got a call about a crash on Interstate 79 in Amma, West Virginia.

Responding officers found an overturned Ford Explorer filled with chickens, some of which took off running along the highway.

Mr Grim suffered a cut and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment before being taken into police custody.

The station WCHS reported that when questioned by investigators, the 21-year-old said that his dog tried to jump out the window of his SUV, causing him to lose control.

When officers searched the 1998 Ford, they found nearly 40 chickens, as well as an AK-47 and a large cache of ammunition, WOWK-TV reported.

Bomb scare: Officers discovered inside the SUV what at first appeared to be improvised explosives, which ultimately turned out to be harmless altered fireworks 

In the back of the SUV police discovered 'improvised explosives', which were later determined by the West Virginia State Police Bomb Squad to be altered but harmless fireworks.

Officers also seized a quart jar containing what was believed to be marijuana.

The accident shut down the West Virginia highway for hours. The fate of Grim’s chickens remains unknown.
