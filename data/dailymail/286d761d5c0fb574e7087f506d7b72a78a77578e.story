Chloe Wilkes, 17, who left school last year, was found collapsed at home in Singleton, Kent, and died in hospital later that same day

A father has appeared in court accused of the manslaughter of his 17 year-old daughter who died after taking MDMA at home.

Jason Wilkes, 44, has also been charged with conspiracy to supply the illegal drug following the death of Chloe Wilkes.

She was found collapsed at her semi-detached home in Ashford, Kent on July 27 and taken to the William Harvey Hospital but pronounced dead later the same day.

Wilkes appeared before magistrates in Folkestone two days later and was remanded in custody to appear at Canterbury Crown Court on August 18. 

Today her teachers and friends paid tribute to the 'sweet' teenager on a Facebook page set up in her memory.

Jon Whitcombe, headmaster of The North School in Ashford, which Chloe left last year, said: 'These are a desperately sad set of circumstances and our thoughts are with family and friends at this most difficult of times.'

Chloe's friend Tiffany King set up a Facebook page in her memory called 'Chloe Wilkes - Little Angel Who's Now In Good Hands', and wrote on it: 'Night Wilkes, have a nice time up there won't ya!

'Will never forget ya and just thinking about our old childhood memories in the garden and toy room - funny times! Think I will dig out the old baby photos of us on the bouncy castle!

'Miss you loads, can't believe this is really happening.'

Luke Payne wrote: 'RIP. Can't stop thinking about you.

'I miss you so much, can't believe I won't ever see you again. I love u so much! You will never be forgotten.'

Hayley Anne Powell wrote: 'Been thinking of you today, Chlo, just like every other day.  Still can't actually get my head round that you're now in a beautiful place called heaven and watching over us all.

'So sad and such a shock to many.

'I love you always our gorgeous angel you'll never be forgotten, not ever. You've got so much support and love behind you, your an amazing character. Keep resting peacefully princess. We all love you!  xxxx'

Rhiannon Leah Hamilton wrote: 'This time last week my world fell beneath me. You are dearly missed, beautiful.

'It still hasn't sunk in. I hope you're okay up there baby! Sleep tight - love you and miss you always.'

Group members have been selling candles and collecting donations to give to Chloe's family.

Chloe was found collapsed at home on July 27 and taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford.

The inquest into her death was opened in Folkestone, Kent and adjourned to a later date.
