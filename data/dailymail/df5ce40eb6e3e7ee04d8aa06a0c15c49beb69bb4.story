Michael Sam, the first openly gay football player in the NFL, broke down in tears as he received a courage award at the ESPYs, telling the audience: 'Great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself.' 

Sam, who was selected by the St Louis Rams in the 2014 NFL draft, received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the annual sports ceremony hosted by ESPN on Wednesday in Los Angeles.

The football star, who had earlier walked the red carpet hand-in-hand with his boyfriend Vito Cammisano, told the audience he feels it rests on his shoulders to stand up for those 'who want nothing more than to be themselves openly'.

He said: 'To anyone out there, especially young people, that feel like they don't fit in and would never be accepted, please know this - great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself.' 

Sam also spoke about how he had helped a friend's sister after she contemplated suicide rather than tell her family she was gay. He broke down as he said: 'She told me that that my example had helped her.'

The athlete, who is from Hitchcock, Texas, thanked the coaches who supported him throughout his career along with his mother who raised him with seven brothers and sisters by herself.

Two of Sam's siblings have died and one disappeared and has not been found.

The football player saved his final word of thanks for boyfriend Vito, saying: 'He is my inspiration.'

Sam, a 2013 University of Missouri graduate, has been publicly out since 2011.

ESPN gave Sam the honor for 'his courage and honesty that resonates beyond sports'.

Sam joins a prestigious list of winners ranging from Jim Valvano, the first recipient in 1995, to Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King, Cathy Freeman, Nelson Mandela and Pat Summitt.

The award is named for Ashe, the inspirational tennis star who died in 1993 after contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.

After learning he had the disease, Ashe campaigned to raise awareness about AIDS.

'Arthur always believed in and practiced leading by example,' said Ashe's widow, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe earlier this year.

'When Michael Sam announced that he is gay, he courageously stepped forward to engage an issue that still remains a pervasive problem in many professional sports. Michael has displayed true leadership both on and off the field.'

Maura Mandt, executive producer of the ESPYs, called Sam a 'humble guy who isn't looking for any accolades'.

'In deciding to give Michael this honor, while his courageous act of coming out is a part of it, the story is about the life he led growing up,' Mandt added. 'A man who has consistently lived his life with integrity, is never afraid of living this truth.'

Other notable winners at the awards show included Richard Sherman, of the Super Bowl champions the Seattle Seahawks, who received a gong for Best Breakthrough Athlete.

Stuart Scott, an ESPN anchor who is battling cancer, received the Jimmy V Perseverance Award.

In his emotional awards speech, Scott said: 'You beat cancer by how you live, why you live and the manner in which you life. So live. Fight like hell.'
