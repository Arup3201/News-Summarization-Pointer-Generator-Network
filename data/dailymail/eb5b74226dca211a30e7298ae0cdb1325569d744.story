Real Sociedad midfielder Gonzalo Castro scored one of the goals of the season but it wasn't enough as David Moyes' side had to settle for a share of the spoils in San Sebastian.  

After an evenly-contested opening half hour, Sociedad took the lead through a Xabi Prieto penalty strike in the 31st minute. 

Deportivo midfielder Jose Rodríguez appeared to handle the ball in the box with referee Pedro Jesus Perez Montero pointing to the spot.

Sociedad captain Prieto duly stepped up to convert to fire his team into the lead at the Anoeta Stadium. 

The home side's lead did not last long, however, as Deportivo were awarded a penalty of their own in the 38th minute.

Sociedad goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli did brilliantly to save Lucas Perez's penalty effort but the Deportivo striker followed up his shot and fired home at the second time of asking to even up the scores.

Sociedad seized the lead once more in the 57th minute with a goal of the highest quality when Gonzalo Castro volleyed home Sergio Canales' cross. 

But Deportivo came roaring back once more as Verdu Nicolas capitised on some poor defending to head home with 12 minutes of the contest remaining.
