When a star TV presenter told his wife his urge to become a Church of England curate was a ‘higher calling’ she dismissed it as a fad.

However, it seems he also could not resist a rather lower calling and, after his ordination, he embarked on an affair with a pretty parishioner who is 20 years younger than him.

Just 13 months after being ordained, he has quit the Church in disgrace, left his wife and moved in with his mistress, 38-year-old Jody Morgan.

Regarded as one of the most authoritative voices in international broadcasting, Charles Hodson presents TV company CNN’s World Business Today, attracting a worldwide audience of 200million.

In a blog, Mr Hodson, 58, who was at Eton with Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote about the moment he told his wife Heike Bernhardt about his decision to take up ordained ministry.

He said: ‘My beloved smiled knowingly and indulgently. “The latest fad,” she remarked, “You’ll have forgotten all about it by next week.”’

However, Miss Bernhardt supported him as he commuted between the B&B they ran on the outskirts of Taunton in Somerset, theological college in Oxford and CNN’s television studios in London.

In June 2012, at Wells Cathedral, the Bishop of Bath and Wells ordained Mr Hodson as a non-stipendiary deacon.

At the time, Mr Hodson joked that his boss at CNN had told him:  ‘Anything you can do to make this place a bit holier, Charles, will be very welcome.’

Soon afterwards, he wrote in his church newsletter: ‘The two lives of curate and TV presenter may seem strange bedfellows – though the transferable skills are many – and I shall be taking care to operate in different modes and disciplines in the parish and in the studio.’

And last January, in a speech to leading City of London figures, he urged his audience to confess their wrongdoings and repent.

Miss Bernhardt, 51, confirmed yesterday that her husband had moved out of the B&B and was now living with his mistress.

She said it had been ‘a big surprise to me’ when she discovered her husband was having an affair with a parishioner at St Andrew’s Church in Taunton.

She told The Times: ‘I still have not met her and I have not made any attempts to know her.

‘It was a woman he met at his parish after he was ordained. He is not living with me any more.’

A spokesman for the Diocese of Bath and Wells said: ‘Mr Hodson resigned his post as assistant curate at St Andrew’s, Taunton, after declaring he had engaged in an adulterous relationship with a woman.

‘He agreed to a penalty by consent under the provisions of the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003 prohibiting him, for a period of five years from August 12, 2013, from exercising any of the functions of his orders as a deacon.’

Mr Hodson began his broadcasting career as a BBC trainee after leaving Oxford University and he moved to Channel 4 News before joining CNN International in 1995.

He is the fourth son of Henry  Hodson, a former editor of The Sunday Times who was also a master of the Worshipful Company of Mercers, as were Charles’s elder brothers Anthony and Daniel, who is a former deputy chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society and former chief executive of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange.
