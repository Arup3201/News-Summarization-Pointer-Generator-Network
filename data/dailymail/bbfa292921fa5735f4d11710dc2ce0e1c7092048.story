A woman on board an Air China flight forced the plane into an emergency landing  after allegedly claiming she had a bomb on board.

The CA1336 flight from Nanning to Beijing was forced to land at Chongqing. A passenger on the plane said the alert was sparked after a woman claimed there was a bomb in the cabin of the aircraft. 

The woman told staff that she wanted to commit suicide after her boyfriend had ended their relationship, and she decided there was no longer any reason to live.

A SWAT team boarded the grounded plane to apprehend the female passenger who claimed to have explosives on her; the passengers were then led off safely

An Air China flight was forced into an emergency landing at Chongqing after a female passenger allegedly said she had a bomb on board

Upon landing, the airbus A321-200 was met by police, ambulances and fire engines. The plane landed safely and there are not believed to be any injuries.

No suspicious devices had been found on the plane following security searches at the airport meaning that it appeared the woman's claim had been a false alarm.

SWAT officers also boarded the plane in front of terrified passengers, before all disembarked safely.  

The woman, named as Wang Li by local media, said the device was on a timer and would explode before they landed in Beijing, causing the pilot to head to the nearest airport and make an emergency landing.
