Shhh! Don't make a sound. This dog is lost in deep concentration.

Kristina Patrick from Alaska filmed her German Shepherd Pakak performing a very skillful trick.

Video footage shows the pup lying on her back with a tennis ball neatly clutched between her front paws. 

Keeping her eyes fixed on the toy, she then proceeds to lift it into the air being careful not to drop it. 

After freezing still for several seconds, Pakak  lowers the ball slowly down.

She then places it in between her teeth, back to where it started.

Pakak's owner says she loves playing with balls. 

Other videos reveal the pup also has a passion for swimming and being by the sea.
