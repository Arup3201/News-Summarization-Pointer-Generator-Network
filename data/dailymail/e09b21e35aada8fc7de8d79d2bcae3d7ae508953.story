Young Lithuanian civilians are swapping their suits and ties for camouflage and joining a paramilitary group amid concerns that Ukraine is 'only the beginning' for Russia.

Lithuania is among the Baltic states calling on NATO to intervene and ward off any potential threat from Russian forces.

But as they wait, a force of students, businessmen, civil servants, 
journalists and politicians are among hundreds who have joined 
the Lithuania Riflemen's Union.

Young Lithuanian civilians are swapping their suits and ties for camouflage and joining a paramilitary group amid concerns that Ukraine is 'only the beginning' for Russia

Russia's takeover of Crimea and increasing signs of its involvement in Ukraine's east are sparking a sharp rise in paramilitary recruits  who have joined the government-sponsored Lithuania Riflemen's Union, a group first set up in 1919 but banned in 1940 under Soviet rule.

The group - which was first set 
up in 1919 but banned in 1940 under Soviet rule - now has around 7,000 members, three times the number since the beginning of the crises in Ukraine, and almost the same the amount of its military personnel.

It comes after a respected Moscow political scientist and editor claimed Vladimir Putin is plotting to rebuild much of the old Soviet Union after being stung by a Barack Obama jibe that he rules a mere 'regional power'

The analysis from Yevgenia Albats came as the West assessed whether the Kremlin leader's seven point peace plan for Ukraine was serious, or a stunt to confuse NATO leaders at their Welsh summit today. 

She claimed recent comments from Putin suggest he has his eyes on grabbing back Kazakhstan and could also swallow up Belarus, Moldova, and even the staunchly Western Baltic states like Estonia, where Obama visited to deliver a message of support for eastern Europe.

Putin said several days ago that the world's ninth largest country Kazakhstan, part of the old tsarist and Soviet empires,  was a recent appearance on the map, adding: 'I am confident that a majority of its population supports development of close ties with Russia.'

The ailing 74-year-old Kazakh dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev - who single-handedly created the state - was 'prudent' and would 'never act against the will of his country's people' by leaning too far to the West, he said.

Albats said the comment was revealing about the intentions of Putin,  who makes all his decisions in 'close contact' with the former KGB.

'Ukraine is only a beginning, and those 'slips' about Kazakhstan are not at all coincidental,' she predicted, adding:  'We will see how it all unfolds in Belarus, Moldova, perhaps the Baltic states, to Kazakhstan, and so on.'

She claimed that Russia's population is falling but if Putin rebuilt the old Soviet empire he would have larger numbers.

'We can only oppose the USA if we are big. The USSR could have done it, even though half of the country was starving,' she said.
