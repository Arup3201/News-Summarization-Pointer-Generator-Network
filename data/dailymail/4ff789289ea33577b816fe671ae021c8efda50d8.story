Police have launched a murder investigation after a father of three was shot dead, after confronting two robbers as he closed his business for the night.

Pragaret Singh, 35, was shot in the chest and abdomen as he left Manchester Food Traders in Openshaw, Greater Manchester, just after 6pm on Friday.

Detectives said Mr Singh, known to friends as Charlie, was believed to have grappled with at least one of the men.

Police have launched a murder investigation after father-of-three Pragaret Singh was shot dead outside his business in Openshaw, Greater Manchester, on Friday evening

Armed police who attended the scene found Mr Singh lying in the road. He was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary but pronounced dead at 7.30pm.

Mr Singh, who had children aged two, five and seven, had run the wholesale food firm on the Manchester industrial estate for more than 15 years.

The victim’s brother, known as Tiggy, said Mr Singh ‘worked 24 hours a day’ to provide for his wife Sukhwinder and children.

‘He was robbed of his life. He was happy, jolly and full of life – he never said anything bad about anyone.

‘He was the kind of person who’d go out of his way to help anyone in need. They could have shot him in the leg, they could have hit him with a stick – but instead they shot him twice.

‘He’s the kind who probably would have put up a fight. He was fit and full of life.’

Detectives said Mr Singh, known to friends as Charlie, was believed to have grappled with at least one of the robbers

Police described one of the attackers as black, in his 20s or 30s, with spiky knotted hair, clean shaven, tall slim build and wearing a jacket with the sleeves rolled up.

They are appealing for information about the movements of a small silver car, possibly a Vauxhall, which may have been used by the thieves.

Detective Superintendent Jon Chadwick, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘His family are absolutely and utterly distraught and our thoughts are with them.

‘We believe this is the tragic death of an innocent businessman and father of three simply trying to protect his livelihood from criminals.

‘As a result, Charlie’s entire family have suffered an unimaginable loss.’

Police said the robbers made off with a ‘large amount of money’.

Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
