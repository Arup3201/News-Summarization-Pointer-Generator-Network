Lionel Messi has had a shirt made up to celebrate getting to 10 million followers on Instagram.

The Barcelona star took to the social networking site on Monday to show a snap of his commemorative kit, with the message: 'leomessi10M muchas gracias a todos. Thank you very much to all.'

Despite his impressive total, Messi still lags behind the most-followed footballer on Instagram Neymar, who has 15.2 million followers, and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo, who has 12.2 million.

Messi had earlier been enjoying some well-earned relaxation time with his girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo after demolishing Athletic Bilbao on Sunday night.

Messi, who scored one and made two goals in the 5-2 thumping of Bilbao, also took to Instagram earlier in the day to post a snap of him and his girlfriend Roccuzzo at their home.

It also gave the Ballon d’Or runner up the chance to reveal a glimpse of his new tattoo.

It’s his third and is the biggest of the designs so far, taking up the majority of the 27-year-old’s upper arm.

Messi also has a tattoo of his mother’s face as well as the hand of his son Thiago with his name underneath.
