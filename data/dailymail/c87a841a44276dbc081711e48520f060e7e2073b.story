In all his years on the pitch, former England footballer Gary Lineker was never even booked with a yellow card.

But watching his home-town club Leicester City beat Manchester United 5-3 on Sunday, the Match of the Day presenter couldn’t quite contain his emotion - and may have stained his squeaky-clean image in the process.

As he watched the relative minnows Leicester score more and more goals against the Premier League giants, his excitement was reflected in a series of foul-mouthed messages he posted on Twitter.

Watching his home-town club Leicester City beat Manchester United 5-3 on Sunday, the Match of the Day presenter couldn’t quite contain his emotion

In all his years on the pitch, former England footballer Gary Lineker was never even booked with a yellow card

First he wrote ‘B***** hell!’, then ‘F****** hell!’ and then rounded it off with: ‘S*** on Man United!’

There were reports yesterday that the presenter - who fronts the Saturday night highlights programme that is supposed to present an impartial view of Premier League matches - was reprimanded by his BBC bosses.

But 53-year-old Lineker later Tweeted to say this was not the case, while the BBC confirmed he had not even received a wrap over the knuckles.

It all happened during the nail-biting match between Leicester City and Manchester United on Sunday afternoon, which ended in City winning 5-3 after being 3-1 down.

The fightback secured their first victory against United since 1998. Lineker played for Leicester in the late 70s and 80s, and was made an honorary vice president after helping save the club from liquidation in 2002.

Lineker posted his Tweets while becoming wrapped up in the drama. While the use of the F word may have been bad enough, the insult towards Manchester United - who are often the main focus of Match of the Day - may be considered more offensive.

There were reports yesterday that the presenter  was reprimanded by his BBC bosses but he denied that

Yesterday reports emerged that Lineker had been given a telling off by BBC bosses, but he appeared to kill off speculation by Tweeting: ‘Dear papers, if I can’t swear when Leicester come from 2 goals down to beat Man Utd 5-3 then I never can. Thanks though for your concern.’

The father-of-four, whose wife is Welsh model Danielle, later posted: ‘It possibly amuses you to make stuff up, but the BBC has never expressed concern to me about any of my tweets.’

And appearing to joke about the situation, Lineker then wrote: ‘Anyway enough of that! I’m done swearing until Leicester beat Manchester...f******...City.’

Last night a spokesperson for the BBC said Lineker was regularly reminded to Tweet responsibly, but that he had not on this occasion been ticked off for his potty mouth.

The father-of-four, whose wife is Welsh model Danielle, was born in Leicester in 1960 and played 194 times for the club, before going on to represent Everton, Barcelona, Tottenham and Nagoya Grampus Eight in Japan

The spokesperson said: ‘Gary’s is a personal twitter account but we regularly remind him of his responsibilities around football based tweets. He has not been reprimanded and he is not going to be reprimanded. That is the end of the matter.’

Lineker was born in Leicester in 1960, the son of a local greengrocer who had inherited his well-established business from his own father and grandfather.

Lineker played 194 times as a striker for Leicester City, before going on to play for Everton, Barcelona, Tottenham and Nagoya Grampus Eight in Japan.

He is the second highest goalscorer for England and was the top scorer in the 1986 World Cup,

As well as forging a successful career as a broadcaster after his playing days ended, he still fronts the advertising campaigns for another well-known Leicester export - Walker’s Crisps.
