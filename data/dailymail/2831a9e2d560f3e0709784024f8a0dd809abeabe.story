If you dream of living beside the seaside, you’d better move fast because house prices are soaring.

The average price of a home in a seaside town has been rising by nearly £500 a month for the last decade. Some of the most popular resorts have seen house prices double in that time.

On average, a home by the sea now costs nearly £200,000, according to Halifax. In places such as exclusive Sandbanks in Dorset and Salcombe in Devon, the average is around £600,000.

Craig McKinlay, mortgage director at Halifax, said: ‘Seaside towns provide a unique lifestyle opportunity and remain popular places for people to live. They also attract people looking for second homes or holiday properties which can place additional upward pressure on house prices.’

Salcombe, where the average home costs £615,344, is the most expensive place to live beside the seaside.

The town is in Devon’s South Hams district, one of the country’s most popular second home hotspots.

It is close to the mouth of the Kingsbridge Estuary, lies within an area of outstanding natural beauty and is loved for its unspoilt beaches and magnificent coastal walks.

Sandbanks, the so-called millionaires’ resort where a tatty bungalow can sell for more than £2million, comes second.

Residents include football manager Harry Redknapp whose QPR team could win promotion to the Premier League today.

Aldeburgh is the only seaside resort in Suffolk to make it into the top ten most expensive seaside towns.

Residents of the picturesque town, whose high street still has traditional sweet shops, recently fought a bitter battle against the opening of a new Tesco.

The average seaside home costs £196,826, but many are a fraction of this and Mr McKinlay said: ‘Living near the seaside remains an achievable dream for many.’

To find an affordable place your best chance is to look north. Mr McKinlay said the ten cheapest seaside towns are all below £95,000, including Newbiggin-by-the-Sea in Northumberland (£83,769), Port Bannatyne (£85,605) and Girvan (£85,868).

The latter two are in Scotland  which has eight of the ten cheapest seaside places.

The annual Halifax report looks at house prices in 196 British seaside towns based on Land Registry and the Registrar of Scotland figures.

It comes after an Office for National Statistics report found some English seaside resorts are among the most deprived places in the country, blighted by high unemployment and poor health.

The investigation laid bare the crisis facing resorts such as Blackpool, Clacton, Ramsgate and Margate.
