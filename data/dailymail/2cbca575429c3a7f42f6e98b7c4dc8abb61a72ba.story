Their manager might claim to be the most sophisticated in this Premier League of riches, but it was a 39-year-old substitute goalkeeper who made a point. In doing so, he also claimed one for West Ham.

It turns out there are some saves left in old Jussi Jaaskelainen, the long-lost Finn who came off the bench and made a quite magnificent block to deny Dejan Tadic in stoppage time.

Without that contribution from a player who has not played in the Premier League since January 1, 2014, West Ham would have lost this game.

Not that Sam Allardyce thought he should have been on the pitch. The fact that he was came down to a questionable judgement from Adrian, Allardyce’s first-choice stopper, and an equally dubious call from the referee to send him off.

The flashpoint came on 61 minutes when Adrian impulsively decided to round Sadio Mane, the Southampton striker, instead of a simple clearance. He made a hash of the move and then handled outside his area in attempting to atone for the error.

The handball was blatant but Allardyce was angry that Craig Pawson and his officials did not spot Mane tugging Adrian’s shirt after the first error. 

Coupled with a late knee injury to Andy Carroll which will keep him out for more than two weeks, it took the shine away from what looked to be an impressive point.

On the sending off, Allardyce said: ‘He (Adrian) made a mistake at the beginning, but he was recovering and the opposition player had two hands on him.

‘If you (the assistant referee) have seen handball on his blinside (but not the grappling), I suggest Mike Riley (the referees’ chief) does something. I can’t suggest publicly because I will get fined. I will appeal the red card immediately.’

The early diagnosis of Carroll was equally grim, considering his recent struggles. 

Allardyce was forced to leave the striker on after a tackle from Maya Yoshida because he had already used all his substitutes. 

Allardyce said: ‘The sad thing is the injury to Andy which we can ill afford. It’s the same knee (he injured against Liverpool on January 31).

‘He got kicked in the back of his knee and he stayed on as nuisance value. We just hope staying on has done no more damage.’

At the very least it helped salvage a point from a game that will have done nothing to make £5bn from Premier League television rights look like a bargain. This was dull, often uninspiring football.

But that is not to say no one deserved the win because Southampton often dominated. They had won six of eight Premier League games coming into this one, but Ronald Koeman has been increasingly concerned about their ability to take chances. This game did nothing except reinforce that view.

He said: ‘It was frustrating. If you are the better team with more ball possession, more chances and you play 25 minutes 11 against 10 you expect to score at least one. We didn’t and that shows a little what has been happening in the last few games - we are struggling to create and score.

‘It was not god enough. We don’t have really have the sharpness and creativity that we had in the beginning of the season. It was another clean sheet but if you play another game like this, in my opinion, you have to create more.’

To that end, West Ham managed only one shot in the first half, while Southampton frequently danced to the edge of the visitor’s error before falling in a muddle.

Mane had an effort hacked off the line by Carl Jenkinson and Cheikhou Kouyate did the same to keep out a Florin Gardos header.

Yoshida required lengthy treatment to a gash beneath his left eye after being caught by a high boot from Cole – making his first appearance since his aborted deadline-day move to West Brom – and West Ham were then cut down by Adrian’s two moments of impulse.

On came Jaaskelainen, the ‘old master’ in Allardyce’s words, and he saved from Tadic. It was brilliant; perhaps the only moment in this match that was.
