When detectives investigate hit-and-run incidents, it often involves illegal drivers in high-powered cars.

But after a 77-year-old woman was sent flying into the air during a horrific hit- and-run in Norfolk, police are searching for a slightly more sedate form of vehicle - a mobility scooter.

Great-grandmother Pauline Potter was left with a broken foot after she was hit outside a garden
centre in Norwich following a shopping trip with her daughter.

Denise Maskell said her ailing mother, who walks with a stick, has not been able to walk properly or sleep since the incident.

Mother-of-three Ms Maskell said: 'It's disgusting that she's having to go through this.

'She has a lot of health problems and just didn't need this.'

The
crash happened at about 3pm on Saturday. The duo were returning to 
their car after Ms Maskell had taken her mother to buy some plants at 
Mousehold Garden Centre.

'We'd had a nice day out.
We'd put her plants down ready to open the car door and I heard her 
scream out and as I turned round this mobility scooter had ploughed into
her,' said Ms Maskell.

'She went right over the top of it.'

She immediately tried to pick her mother up from the floor to avoid her being struck by passing cars.

Ms Maskell was even helped by four Good Samaritans who went to her aid.

'Mum just couldn't stand up,' she said.

'Four people came to help me get her up and I wanted to thank them, they were brilliant.'

Ms Maskell took her distraught mother home.

Accidents involving mobility scooters are not as rare as some might think.

Following an increase in accidents in Norfolk, its police force launched a Safe Scoot campaign, which was also rolled out nationwide.

There are about 330,000 people in the UK who use mobility scooters, with models capable of speeds from 4mph to 8mph.

Some of them are difficult to manoeuvre and have led to accidents.

The course teaches basic manoeuvres such as starting off, reversing, negotiating shopping aisles.

But
she was unable to walk and they called an ambulance which took Mrs 
Potter to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital for an X-ray, which showed 
she had broken a foot.

Her foot had to be put in a temporary plaster but she has now been given a boot to wear to try and help it heal.

Ms Maskell said her mother has been in agony and can hardly get up off the sofa or sleep.

'I'm very upset that the person responsible failed to stop.

'I think it's disgusting,' said Ms Maskell. 'It was a big scooter.

'He or she knew they hit my mother and they just carried on going and that's what makes me really angry.

'They were coming up behind us and so saw my mother had a stick.

'They just came from nowhere and my poor mum flew up in the air.'

Ms Maskell urged anyone with information about the incident to contact police, who have launched an investigation.
