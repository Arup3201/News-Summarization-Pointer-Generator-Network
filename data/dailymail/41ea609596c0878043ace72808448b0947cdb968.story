Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis has returned to France for some rest after collapsing on the pitch against Tottenham last Wednesday.

The French striker caused panic when he fainted at White Hart Lane during Swansea's 3-2 defeat to Spurs.

But the forward confirmed afterwards that he was fine, and that the collapse had been brought on by emotional stress caused by his father's illness.

With the Swans not playing again until next Monday, Gomis took the chance to return home to visit his family, stopping off for a meal at his favourite restaurant.

'Back in Lyon,' he wrote on his Instagram account. 'Family and some rest during the break, before restarting. I took the opportunity to pay a visit to my friend Marco in one of my favorite places.'

Swansea have a week off as they are not involved in the FA Cup quarter-finals, and do not face Liverpool until Monday of next week.
