Two New York police sources have said they would not miss Alec Baldwin should he move to Los Angeles

New York police sources have reportedly said Alec Baldwin will not be missed should he move to Los Angeles.

The actor revealed yesterday in New York magazine that he ‘probably’ needs to move out of the city and said he was considering L.A.

Baldwin said he misses the days when New Yorkers would signal their appreciation of celebrities briefly and politely while taking care to maintain privacy.

An NYPD police officer responded however 
by telling The New York Post: ‘I say: Don’t let the door hit you on the 
way out of the city.’

The officer, who has not been named, reportedly knows Baldwin from the actor’s neighbourhood, Greenwich Village.

‘I
 don’t like the guy. It’s a pain in the ass to deal with him every time 
he blows his top at the press and we’re called in to clean up the mess.’

The source said that Mr Baldwin shows ‘respect’ to police officers, but said he wasn’t sure if it was ‘sincere’ or not.

Another police source also told the paper: ‘Good riddance.’

They also said that his life would not get any better if he moves to L.A., pointing out that the press would 'hound' him there as well.

In
 the New York interview, headlined 'I Give Up', he talks about beginning to ‘crave’ Los Angeles
 after more than 30 years in the Big Apple because he thinks he would be able
 to give wife Hilaria and their six-month-old daughter Carmen a more 
peaceful and private life.

'I give up': Melodramatic Alec Baldwin laments his A-list life as he predicts he will 'probably' have to leave New York in candid new interview

Revealing: The interview is said to detail the former 30 Rock star's feud with fellow actor Shia LaBeouf and the dispute with MSNBC that ended his short-lived Up Late talk show

In the same interview, Mr Baldwin also claims Shia LaBeouf verbally attacked him while making Orphans, leading to their bust-up.

The
 55-year-old star and Mr LaBeouf were engulfed in a feud after clashing while 
making the Broadway play partly because he claims the Transformers actor
 'began to sulk' because Mr Baldwin didn't learn his lines ahead of 
rehearsals.

He said: 'One day he attacked me in front of 
everyone. He said, “You’re slowing me down, and you don’t know your 
lines. And if you don’t say your lines, I’m just going to keep saying my
 lines.”

'We all sat, 
frozen. I snorted a bit, and, turning to him in front of the whole cast,
 I asked, “If I don’t say my words fast enough, you’re going to just say
 your next line?” I said. “You realise the lines are written in a 
certain order?” He just glared at me.'

Mr Baldwin claims he asked for a break to cut short the incident and went to speak
 to the stage manager with director Dan Sullivan and offered to quit the
 project and insisted they didn't fire Mr Labeouf.

But
 the actor recalls Mr LaBeouf, who he had heard was 'potentially very 
difficult to work with', was 'shocked' when he was given his marching 
orders from the show.

Love-hate
 relationship: The volatile star has long lamented the intrusion into 
his private life and several homophobic rants have notably affected his 
career, with his short-lived Up Late talk show cancelled in November 
following an anti-gay slur at a photographer

Elsewhere in the article, which features an accompanying close-up of Mr Baldwin as he 
stares into the camera with a neutral, if
 a little sour, expression on his face, the Oscar-nominee discusses his 
feelings about MSNBC, on which he had short-lived talk show Up Late.

The programme was pulled off air for good in November after five episodes 
following what was initially a two-week suspension, reportedly 
due to Mr Baldwin's use of yet another anti-gay slur during an altercation with a
 photographer outside his home.

While the official word was that the two
 parted ways mutually, sources say the star's 'diva-like behaviour 
towards co-workers', along with the homophobic comment, played a 
deciding factor in the decision.

But
 in his New York magazine chat, he insists he 'never wanted' to be on 
MSNBC in the first place and describes it as 'the same s**t all day 
long' as well as slamming several stars of the channel including talk 
show host Joe Scarborough.

Speaking about the channel, he said: 'Morning Joe was boring. Scarborough is neither eloquent nor funny. And merely cranky doesn’t always work well in the morning. Mika B. is the Margaret Dumont of cable news. I liked Chris Jansing a lot. Very straightforward. I like Lawrence O’Donnell, but he’s too smart to be doing that show. Rachel Maddow is Rachel Maddow, the ultimate wonk/dweeb who got a show, polished it, made it her own. She’s talented. The problem with everybody on MSNBC is none of them are funny, although that doesn’t prevent them from trying to be.'

However, Ms Maddow - who he described as 'phony who doesn't have the same passion for truth off-camera that she seems to have on air - seems to have dismissed his claims, highlighting that they have never even met.

She tweeted: 'I have never met Mr. Baldwin, either on-camera or off-camera. I wish him all the best.'

Around the same time the Up Late talk
 show was pulled, Baldwin lamented the invasion of privacy he and his 
family faces on a daily basis, ranting in an open letter on the Huffington Post that he was willing to give it all up to protect his loved ones.

'If
 quitting the television business, the movie business, the theater, any 
component of entertainment, is necessary in order to bring safety and 
peace to my family, then that is an easy choice,' he wrote.

'This country’s obsession with the private lives of famous people is tragic.'

'It is an easy choice': In November, the former 30 Rock actor said it was a no-brainer that he would give up his career for the sake of protecting his family - pictured here with wife Hilaria Baldwin and six-month-old daughter Carmen in Madrid earlier this month
