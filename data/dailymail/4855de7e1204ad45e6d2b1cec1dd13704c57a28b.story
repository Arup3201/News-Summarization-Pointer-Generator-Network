Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf is facing calls to step down as the new head of the independent inquiry into child sex abuse

The new chairman of the government inquiry into child sex abuse faced calls to resign last night over her dinner party links to Leon Brittan.

Fiona Woolf has now admitted she entertained the former Home Secretary and his wife three times at dinner parties at her house, and twice went to his central London home for dinner.

But despite their social contacts she insisted she did not have a ‘close association’ with the peer. Lord Brittan is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry about allegations – which he denies – that in his time as Home Secretary in the Eighties he was at the centre of an Establishment cover-up of sex abuse claims.

Mrs Woolf, who lives on the same street as the peer, also met his wife for coffee several times, sat on a prize-giving panel with her, and sponsored her £50 for a charity run.

Former Home Secretary Lord Brittan is accused of failing to act on a dossier about alleged VIP paedophile rings given to him by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983.

The peer has denied the claims. Mrs Woolf, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday, insisted the inquiry would ‘relentlessly uncover the truth for the victims’.

But Labour MPs called on her to resign, and victims’ representatives said she was not an appropriate person for the job. Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, who led the campaign for an inquiry, said Mrs Woolf and Lord Brittan were ‘clearly good friends’ and she should stand down.

Mr Danczuk said she seemed ‘out of her depth’ in her appearance before the MPs’ committee yesterday. And he made the extraordinary claim the Home Office may have been trying to ‘protect’ Lord Brittan with the appointment.

‘I have serious concerns about the relationship between Fiona Woolf and Leon Brittan,’ he said. ‘He is surely somebody who has to be investigated as part of the inquiry – not least because of his role as Home Secretary at the time.

‘The public will be concerned they are trying to protect Lord Brittan.’

He added: ‘The vast majority of people I know, if you have somebody round for dinner in your home, you would consider them a good friend. She should not be doing this job.’

Details of Mrs Woolf’s contacts with the Brittans emerged in a letter she sent to Home Secretary Theresa May, published yesterday.She said they lived on the same street since 2004, and invited the couple to a party at her home in January 2008, October 2008 and February 2009.

She also attended dinner parties hosted by Lord Brittan in November 2009 and February 2012. Mrs Woolf told the committee she was given Home Office help in drafting the letter.

Labour MP Keith Vaz, the committee chairman, said it was a ‘bit odd’ a draft of the letter was seen by the Home Office before it was sent to Mrs May. ‘Surely you should have written your own letter?’ he asked.

Labour MP Paul Flynn pointed out the first choice as inquiry chair, Lady Butler-Sloss, had withdrawn because her brother was Attorney General during some of the period in question. ‘You seem to be an Establishment figure as well. Shouldn’t you resign in the interest of the report being accepted?’ he asked.

Labour MP for Bassetlaw John Mann said it was ‘totally impossible’ for Mrs Woolf to chair the inquiry.

Alison Millar from law firm Leigh Day, who is representing several victims, claimed the inquiry would amount to little more than a ‘reheat’ of past reviews, adding: ‘Yet again we call on the Government to appoint an appropriate person.’

Mrs Woolf was given the full backing of Downing Street and the Home Office. A Number 10 spokesman insisted Mrs Woolf had the Prime Minister’s confidence, and she and the panel would ‘carry out their duties to the high standards of integrity required’.

Before MPs Mrs Woolf, a former president of the Law Society and the current Lord Mayor of London, insisted she was not a member of the Establishment and was an ‘ordinary solicitor’. She said Lord Brittan was ‘one of thousands’ of people she knew in London.

Lord Brittan is accused of burying a dossier given to him by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983.

It documented the alleged involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring. He has denied the claims. These are the unanswered questions:
