You’ve had the announcement that Carl Froch and George Groves will meet again in what I believe to be the biggest British fight of all time.

They have been slagging each other off privately on Twitter for weeks – more of that later – and now it’s time to work out some of the logistics.

I can reveal here that my two frontrunners for the venue on May 31 are the Emirates Stadium and Wembley.

War of words: Carl Froch and George Groves have been trading blows already via direct messages on Twitter

Shake on it: Eddie Hearn completed the deal for Froch to fight Groves (pictured signing his contract live on TV) last week

People have suggested that I have ruled out Wembley because England will have a football match there against Peru on May 30. That’s not true.

It is a massive logistical challenge to stage a fight of this magnitude just a day later but I am doing everything I can to make sure I have the best options available. That includes Wembley.

We are also looking at Old Trafford and the City Ground in Nottingham, but my heart says this is a London fight. This is a statement fight, a fight that will show where boxing stands.

Front runner: The 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium could host the British Fight of the Year between Froch and Groves on May 31

Big event: Wembley Stadium remains in the running to host the big bout too despite England playing Peru there 24 hours beforehand

For me, I want nothing less than the challenge of getting a massive stadium and filling it because I think this fight merits that. As part of making that statement, I think it doesn’t get much bigger than Wembley.

The Emirates would be superb as well. I was there at the weekend to watch Arsenal beat Liverpool and the facilities are outstanding. Like anything in boxing, we have to crunch the numbers and see what offers the best value, but, like I said, I do not want to undersell this fight. I believe we can fill a huge arena.

Vintage: Late great Henry Cooper and legendary heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali fought twice - the first at Wembley Stadium in 1963

Rematch: Highbury hosted the 1966 rematch between Cooper and Ali, where the American retain his heavyweight title with victory

Some people in the industry tell me this is a fight for 60,000 people. That would be perfect for the Emirates. But I do think we can do 80,000 people. More than 20,000 people have already signed up to our ticket alert site and I think we could sell 40,000 tickets in a day. That is also why, as much as Carl would love to fight in Nottingham, I want to look at bigger venues.

Arsenal would love to stage it. They staged Muhammad Ali-Henry Cooper at Highbury in 1966 and one of their directors, Ken Friar, was telling me how much they want to be involved. It’s going to be a special night.

I can also reveal here the depth of the hate between Carl and George. I became aware a few weeks back, while George was making his appeals to the IBF, that they had started sending direct messages to each other on Twitter!

George was accusing Carl of ducking him, Carl was biting back and saying he was going to knock him out. They must have sent 12 messages each, George goading Carl and Carl responding.

Tricky trees: Froch, pictured with former Nottingham Forest striker Nathan Tyson in 2006, would love to fight at his beloved City Ground... and it remains a possibility

On the list: Old Trafford, home of Man United, could see Froch and Groves return to the city of their first fight

Joshua will prove he is the BEST of British by going after Fury and Chisora... but superstar must wait until next year

Froch-Groves II MUST happen this year... and my dream is to have it at Wembley in front of 80,000 fans

It’s that animosity that has made this the single most challenging promotion I have ever been involved with.

There is so much genuine hatred there that every point of negotiation has been a battle. Neither man wanted to give up anything. It got to the point where, among a bunch of other things, they were arguing over what seats their guests would have at ringside and no-one wanted to back down.

Thankfully we got there in the end. George has worked tirelessly to force this fight and Carl appreciates what the public wants. He has never ducked a fight in his life and after some of the things that were said following the last one I think he feels he has a few scores to settle.

Unfinished business: Froch wants to put the Groves saga behind him once and for good when they meet again

Bitter feeling: Groves remains upset over his controversial stoppage by referee Howard Foster when he lost to Froch last November

It has bothered him, some of the stick he has taken from the public, because Carl has spent his career proving he is one of the great warriors in the history of the sport.

Now he is going in with some real purpose. That makes him an extremely dangerous man fighting an extremely talented young fighter who is convinced he can win. I am so excited.

This fight is huge and whichever stadium we end up in will reflect that. Imagine the build up, the anticipation and that epic night with the biggest crowd in post-war boxing history as both of these great fighters put it all on the line. It’s making the hairs on my neck stand up just talking about it.

Ready to rumble: Froch and Groves can't wait to meet each other in the ring again as they prepare to embark on a huge nationwide roadshow to promote their blockbuster bout

Ricky Burns is back in Glasgow on March 1 for the most important fight of his career. It says everything about the guy that he’s excited to face such a quality fighter as Terence Crawford in his first fight since what happened against Raymundo Beltran.

I’ll never forget visiting Ricky in the hospital after that fight, I’ve never seen a man is so much pain. He was lucky and unlucky that night.

He was lucky to get a draw, but unlucky to fight for half an hour with a broken jaw. Boxers are different to normal people, but not many could endure what he did that night.

Last time out: Ricky Burns managed to keep his world title despite being floored by Raymundo Beltran in his last contest

Pain game: Burns escaped with a draw in a hard-fought warn with Beltran back in September last year

Hurt: Burns suffered a broken jaw during the Beltran clash in Glasgow

When I saw him on the hospital ward, he 
was screaming. He was in so much pain, pure agony. The fact he fought 
through that just makes you appreciate how tough he is.

He needs to be ready for this Crawford fight. Crawford is red hot, dangerous and has won all 22 of his fights - 16 by knockout. He is tough, he is Ricky’s mandatory challenger and I think it is the best fight in the lightweight division. Oddly enough, it’s the kind of fight Ricky will love.

He is a raw fighting man. He is so humble. He does nothing flash. I’m sure he doesn’t even spend what we pay him – he doesn’t go in for Ferraris, mansions and all that. He still works each Saturday in his mate’s sports shop. He doesn’t need to do it, but he does. That’s Ricky.

Can he win this fight? A lot of people don’t think so, but I think he will, possibly by a late stoppage. It’s interesting that before this fight Crawford didn’t have a passport and has never been outside the US. How will he travel? How will he adapt when he sees and hears 10,000 Scots screaming for Ricky?

I think that will be a big factor. From that point of view, I am calling on all Scots to make yourselves heard and get Ricky over the line, he is a true champ.

Challenger: American Terence Crawford will arrive in Scotland with an unbeaten record from 22 fights with 16 victories coming by the way of knockout

On the undercard, we have John Murray fighting John Simpson. That is set up to be a belter.

And Anthony Joshua fights Hector Alfredo Avila. This guy took Dereck Chisora nine rounds less than a year ago, so people are going to get a real idea of where AJ is in his development.

Big time: Unbeaten Anthony Joshua will fight this Saturday in Hull against tough opponent Hector Alfredo Avila

Luke Campbell has his fifth fight on Saturday in Hull. Every time I watch him I admire just how talented he is.

Like AJ, he is an Olympic champion, one of the finest talents I have ever seen and we are plotting the early stages of his career.

My view is that this will be his last tune-up fight and then we will put him in at title level. I would say that by the end of the year he will have a British title and by the end of 2015 he’ll be a world champion.

Heading for the top: London 2012 Olympics gold medal hero Luke Campbell has been tipped to become a world champion by the end of 2015

Head-to-head: Eddie Hearn captured Campbell (L) sparring with Kevin Mitchell last week and posted this picture on his Twitter account

He is more experienced than Anthony – he had well over 100 amateur fights – and I’ve been amazed by how well he has equipped himself in sparring people like Ricky Burns and Kevin Mitchell.

He is a 5ft 9ins southpaw lightweight – he is heading for the top.

A few of you might have noticed on Twitter than I am running in the London Marathon to raise money for the Haven House Children’s Hospice.

There’s another story behind that. My dad, Barry, watched that film The Bucket List a while back and one of the things he wants is to see me run a marathon.

He’s done nine and always gives me stick about it.

It’s better than his last tick off the list. He went to Las Vegas and got his first tattoo – a heart with fire on his arm saying family. It’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen!
