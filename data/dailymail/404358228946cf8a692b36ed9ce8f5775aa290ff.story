FIFA’s warring ethics chiefs effectively passed the buck over World Cup bid corruption onto another Zurich official on Thursday to complicate the long-running controversy yet further.

Michael Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert met at FIFA’s Zurich headquarters on Thursday to sort out their differences. This followed the unprecedented situation of investigator Garcia disowning the summary of his report made by judge Eckert that cleared Russia and Qatar to stage the next two World Cups and apportioned most blame for violating bid integrity on the England 2018 campaign.

The only common ground that the pair could find was that Swiss financier Domenico Scala, chairman of FIFA’s audit and compliance committee should receive full copies of all reports before determining how much of that information should be made available to the FIFA ExCo.

Yet taking the report verdict back into the FIFA house rather destroys the point of having set up supposedly independent investigatory and adjudicatory chambers in the first place although Scala is not a full time FIFA employee.

There was no clarity on whether New York attorney Garcia was still taking his misrepresentation case at Eckert’s judgement summary to the FIFA appeals committee.

Garcia has opened up a number of formal cases against individuals as a result of his inquiry which will remain ongoing.
