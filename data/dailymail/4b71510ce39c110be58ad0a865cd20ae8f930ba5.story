It's been at the forefront of British politics for months.

And last night the issue of Scottish Independence weighed heavy on the hearts of British TV stars too, as the nation's favourite actors lined up  for the premier of the latest series of Downton Abbey.

Speaking from the red carpet in Leicester Square, London, the characters from the beloved ITV drama gave their views on the issue ripping the nation apart.

Laura Carmichael, who plays Lady Edith on the ITV drama said she 'didn't know' how she felt on the matter 

Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes said he would be sorry to see the union lost but that it was a matter for the Scottish people to decide 

Jim Carter, known to many as the grumpy butler Carson, refused to comment as an Englishman but said he hoped 'they all' vote (in Scotland)

Their comments come as polling stations across Scotland prepare to open in a matter of hours. 

The programme's creator, Julian Fellowes, said: 'I would be sorry to see the union lost.' 

'But I feel quite strongly this is a matter for the people of Scotland and, you know, we keep harrying them from down here and telling them what they can't have if they vote this way and so on. 

'I think we should leave them alone to come to their decision. You know, I wish at the beginning we'd said we will discuss all the terms if and when you vote for independence, we hope you don't.'  

Lesley Nicol, who plays Mrs Patmore the cook, was less sure on the matter. 

'I don't know. If I was Scottish , I'm half Scottish, but I'm not fully Scottish so I think it's very different if you live up there so I don't think I'm the person to comment on it.'

Laura Carmichael, who plays the unlucky-in-love Lady Edith, admitted: 'I don't know... I don't know really,' while Jim Carter, the face of the grumpy butler Carson, was even less forthcoming. 

Mary Berry offered a more emotional opinion saying she thought the union should 'stay as a family'

'I won't comment on that I'm English for god's sake. Let them vote and all I want is them all to vote.'  

Mary Berry of Great British Bake Off took a more emotional stance. 

'We should all stay as a family... It's been like that forever and I think that's how it should stay,' she said. 

Downton Abbey will begin again on ITV this Sunday.

Welsh singer Charlotte Church took to Twitter to share her views on today's referendum. 

'Go on Scotland... Do it!!!!!' was her first post, followed by a link to the Bjork song Declare Independence. 

'If it was Welsh independence being decided upon I would be fighting HARD!!' she continued. 

Meanwhile singer Charlotte Church offered her view on Twitter, writing last night: 'Go on Scotland... Do it!!!'

Later she posted a video to the Bjork song Declare Independence, accompanied with the caption: 'If it was Welsh independence being decided upon I would be fighting HARD!!!!'

Earlier in the week celebrities Bob Geldof, Eddie Izzard and Al Murray were slammed for taking part in a pro-union rally in London by critics pointing out that none of the three men were Scottish. 

Speaking to a packed Trafalgar Square, Sir Bob implored crowds to stay in the UK, saying; 'We're all f****** fed up with Westminster,' while Yemeni-born Izzard, who has previously spoken of plans to enter politics himself, took a softer approach. 

Sporting a Union Jack manicure, the comedian told voters: 'We care.' 

Sir Bob later appeared on a special edition of Newsnight, in which he suggested a vote for independence meant Scots were 'going off in a huff'.

Unwelcome opinions: Eddie Izzard and Bob Geldof were met with bemusement by some critics when offering their views on the matter at a pro-union rally in Trafalgar Square earlier this week
