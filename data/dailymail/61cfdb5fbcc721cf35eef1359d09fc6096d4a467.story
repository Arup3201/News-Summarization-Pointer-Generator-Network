Sci-fi nuts in Chicago have staged the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol entirely in Klingon, the fictional language of the villainous alien race in Star Trek.

The play is being staged at the Raven Theatre in Chicago in the language created more than 30 years ago for the Star Trek race of long-haired, ridge-foreheaded warriors.

Those who do not speak the language can enjoy the unfolding drama thanks to English subtitles.

Although Klingon has a small vocabulary of between 2,000 and 3,000 words, it is the most spoken fictional language in the world, according to Guinness World Records.

Last month a Swedish couple were married in a Klingon wedding ceremony at a Star Trek convention in London.

Arika Okrent stated in her book 'In the Land of Invented Languages' that there are probably around 20-30 fluent speakers of the language.

The play's synopsis states: 'SQuja' (Scrooge) has no honor, nor any courage. Can three ghosts help him to become the true warrior he ought to be in time to save Tiny Tim from a horrible fate?

'Performed in the Original Klingon with English Supertitles, and narrative analysis from The Vulcan (the highly logical race to which Spock belongs) Institute of Cultural Anthropology.'

A review from ChicagoTheaterBeat said: 'It holds up surprisingly well; the storyline is easy to follow, and the actors imbue their characters with a Dickensian energy infused with a healthy dose of bloodlust.'

The play includes a puppet with the race's distrinctive clothing and alien features that is used to represent Tiny Tim.

It was written by Christopher O. Kidder and Sasha Walloch and was originally translated by Laura Thurston, Bill Hedrick and Christopher O. Kidder.
