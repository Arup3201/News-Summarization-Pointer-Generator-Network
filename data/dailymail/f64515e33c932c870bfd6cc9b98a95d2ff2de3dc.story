Kai Lambe, from Hatton, Derbyshire slipped into the weir at Tutbury Mill and got into difficulty. His parents paid tribute to their 'happy, outgoing' son

A nine-year-old boy has died after slipping into a weir while playing with friends.

Kai Lambe is thought to have drowned after he fell into the river Dove in Tutbury, Staffordshire, on Friday evening.

The youngster was pulled from the water by firefighters - but died later in hospital.

It is believed his horrified pals witnessed the incident, and raised the alarm.

Kai's devastated family was being supported by specially trained police officers.

In a statement they said: 'Kai was a happy, outgoing and lovely little boy. We are heartbroken and devastated at the loss of our vibrant, happy, bubbly little man, Kai Joseph, 'ginge' to all who knew him.

'He was our ray of sunshine who brightened up the darkest day. We, as a family, are overwhelmed with the support of everyone in the close-knit village of Hatton and from people afar.

'He was always out and about, whether it was fishing, taking his beloved dogs for a walk with his dad or just in the village. He would smile and put his thumb up to everyone.'

'He was a much-loved son of Dawn and Ali, little brother of Ellie-May and Tom, grandson, uncle, nephew, cousin and loved by many. RIP wee man.'

Staffordshire Police have now launched an investigation to work out exactly what happened, but Kai's death is not being treated as suspicious.

It is believed he was playing with a group of other children at the weir, around half a mile from his home in Hatton, Derbyshire, at 6.15pm when he fell into the river.

Bunches of flowers were left at the scene of the tragedy, and tributes have also been paid online to Kai, where a fund has been set up to raise money for a memorial.

Leanna Turner wrote: 'Such a special boy that has touched the community, RIP little man, you will be missed.'

Chloe Springall said: 'My thoughts are with his family and friends, He deserves something special from all of us! Sweet dreams Kai.'

And Lisa Cook posted: 'RIP Kai. Such a lovely boy taken too soon.'

On Facebook, the community group Hatton through the years posted: 'Hatton is such a close community and today it mourns the death of a beautiful little boy who was tragically taken away from us.

'I know this will have an effect on everyone in the village. He was such a little character. I'm sure everyone will join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to his family at this very sad time, I can't even begin to think how they are feeling. He was taken away from them far too young.'

A spokesman for Staffs Police said: 'He was rescued from the water by colleagues from the fire service and taken to Queen's Hospital in Burton where he sadly died.

'His death is not being treated as suspicious and a report will be prepared for HM Coroner.

'Specially trained officers are now supporting the boy's family and friends at this very difficult time.

'We are continuing to work with colleagues from the other emergency services to understand the exact circumstances of what happened.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'A team responded to Tutbury on Friday evening to reports of a nine-year-old who had fallen into a weir on the river Dove.

'Our thoughts are with the family, friends & our emergency services colleagues who were involved in the tragic incident.'
