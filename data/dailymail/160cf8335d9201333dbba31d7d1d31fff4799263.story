The deal signed by the eurozone countries still faces huge hurdles, because of simmering tensions between the member states – and growing disenchantment within their own borders.

A startling poll last night showed that only a third of French people believed that their country should stay in the euro indefinitely.

The situation in Germany was scarcely better with support for staying in the single currency long-term standing at just 41 per cent.

The figures were revealed in a ComRes survey for CNN last night. It shows how the leaders pressing for closer integration are dangerously out of touch with their own people.

The poll was conducted across seven eurozone countries. It also found that only 38 per cent in Greece and 37 per cent in Ireland and Portugal wanted to remain in the euro.

The study found that almost half of the French and Germans believe they would be better off outside the euro. Some 42 per cent in both countries said they should never have joined the currency.

Just 37 per cent of people in Germany and 35 per cent in France believe their economies are in better shape because they are in the euro.

In Germany about 40 per cent were 
also opposed to the idea of closer European integration as championed by
 Angela Merkel. Only 15 per cent thought EU officials could be trusted 
to run Germany’s economy. In France, just 20 per cent of people thought 
EU officials should be handed sweeping powers over the economy.

The
 financial markets gave a muted welcome to the new agreement. Italian 
bond yields remained close to the critical 7 per cent figure.

The
 credit rating agency Moody’s reacted by downgrading three major French 
banks. Moody’s downgraded BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit 
Agricole by one notch, saying the ‘severity of the euro crisis has 
increased’.

Mats Persson, director of the think tank Open Europe, said the deal failed to tackle the fundamental debt problems that had brought the single currency to its knees.

Mr Persson said: ‘This was meant to be the summit to solve the eurozone crisis, but fundamentally little has changed.

‘The fiscal sanctions lack teeth and credibility, huge questions remain unanswered over the role and firepower of the bailout funds, and the fundamental problems owing to a lack of competitiveness and growth prospects are only superficially addressed.

‘The failure to address these substantive issues has nothing to do with the UK veto.’

Bill Gross, head of the world’s biggest bond investor Pimco, also gave the deal a far from ringing endorsement.

In a message on Twitter he said: ‘Oh what a tangled web the EU has weaved. Never ending story – hard to trust.’  France and Germany, who have forced the deal through, are also still divided on several key details, such as the extent to which sanctions for countries that breach the new budget limits should be automatic.

Mrs Merkel had been keen to persuade David Cameron to sign up to the deal – seeing Britain as a counterbalance to French protectionism which now threatens to dominate the EU.

British officials question whether the deal is focused on the right issues. A government source said it was unclear if new rules on budget deficits would be adhered to when similar rules in the original deal to set up the euro had been flouted. Britain wants the eurozone to focus on improving competitiveness.

The deal will face significant democratic hurdles in some countries – potentially slowing it for years.

Ireland’s minister for Europe, Lucinda Creighton, said there was a ‘50-50’ chance that Ireland’s constitution would require a referendum. Prime minister Enda Kenny said he would need legal advice before deciding whether to call a referendum.

‘Every country has to do its own thing,’ he said. ‘In our case, the attorney general will have to analyse that and give formal advice to the government.’ A referendum in Ireland could prove extremely difficult to win. That prospect diminished further when it emerged Paris and Berlin are pressing for corporation tax to be ‘harmonised’ across the EU.

With corporation tax at just 12.5 per cent, Ireland has the lowest rate in the EU – a status it guards jealously as an incentive for foreign firms to invest.

Hungary, the Czech Republic and Sweden said they would need to consult their parliaments before signing up. There are also doubts about whether the Danish government will survive if it tries to push the deal through. In some of the EU’s smaller countries there is growing resentment at the idea of Berlin taking charge of their economies.

Last night General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the American Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he was ‘extraordinarily concerned’ over the potential for civil unrest in Europe.

He warned: ‘We are extraordinarily concerned by the health and viability of the euro because in some ways we’re exposed literally to contracts but also because of the potential of civil unrest and breakup of the union that has been forged over there.’
