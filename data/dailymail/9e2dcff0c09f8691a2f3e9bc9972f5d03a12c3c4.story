Police in Los Angeles distributed DVDs today featuring surveillance video of a man wanted for questioning in connection with a rash of suspicious car fires in the city.

The person of interest is a white male between 20 and 30 years old with a receding hairline and a shoulder-length ponytail, according to Officer Sara Faden. 

The man was seen on video Saturday after emerging on foot from inside an underground parking structure on Hollywood Boulevard that was the scene of a car fire.

Detectives estimated the man, who was wearing a bulky jacket, is between 5'6" and 6'1" tall.

Faden said investigators are asking for the public's help in identifying the man on the video.

Detectives spent early Sunday 
analysing security video camera footage and following up on other leads 
after a half dozen more vehicles were set on fire on New Year's Eve.

The arson attacks have left a trail 
of smouldering debris across the city since Thursday after 39 fires were
set. Most were set in parked cars and in several cases, flames spread 
to carports and apartments.

Authorities haven't said how the car 
fires started and were unsure if the blazes were the work of one arsonist or copycats.

Police Commander Andrew Smith said his force was 'working on hundreds of clues, interviewing dozens of witnesses, picking up countless pieces of evidence'.

No one has been injured in the attacks so far but extra patrols were out in force on New Year's Eve.

One
of Saturday's attacks occurred at the Hollywood and Highland 
entertainment complex, a popular tourist destination. Firefighters 
responded after reports of a small car fire in a parking structure that 
was out by the time they arrived.

Fire
crews said this recent spate has been unusual because of the frequency 
and location of the fires. Crews have been responding to other 
emergencies despite the focus on solving the arsons, fire spokesman Erik
Scott said.

Response: The fires started shortly after midnight and occurred over a four-hour span before dawn

Police urged residents to check their cars for any signs of tampering and take precautions such as locking their cars, keeping the garage lights on at night and reporting suspicious activity.

'We are not going to rest,' Los Angeles Fire Department assistant chief Pat Butler said at a joint police-fire news conference. 'We are going to work tirelessly.'

Four car fires broke out in the Los Angeles area on New Year's Eve, 
leaving authorities to probe for any links to a series of arson blazes 
that burned dozens of cars in previous days.

In a sobering counterpoint to the typical revelry of the night, fire 
trucks were stationed in neighborhoods, police patrolled the city, 
switchboards took hotline calls and thousands in rewards were offered.

Fire fighters quickly put out a car fire at about 6pm in Hollywood that 'fits the profile of concern' authorities have been following for the arsons.

A crew of ten put out the fire in minutes. The flames did not spread beyond the car and no one was injured. Officials were unsure how the fire started.

Shortly before 9 pm, firefighters made quick work of two car fires in a carport in West Hollywood.

Fire dispatch supervisor Robert Diaz said the fires were put out before they could spread.

The fire closely resembled more than a
dozen set before dawn on Saturday, mostly in North Hollywood, and nearly 
two dozen fires set in and around Hollywood a day earlier.

Though some of the fires spread and damaged homes and apartments, none have brought injuries.

'We're pulling out all the stops,' 
fire department spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 'We're hoping that the 
person or people responsible will be brought to swift and complete 
justice.'

At least 16 more cars were set alight over a three-hour period early Saturday. Authorities have offered at least $35,000 for information leading to the capture of the arsonists.

Destroyed: Authorities inspect the damage at a garage. They believe the arsonist could have travelled by foot or bike as the fires broke out in a limited two-mile area

San Fernando fire captain George Villegas told ABC News some people have been questioned in connection to the blazes.

'We've
detained a number of people, none that we can say are legitimately 
connected to this investigation at this point,' Villegas said.

Detectives
are looking for a male driving a white and tan mid-1990s Lexus ES300 
that was seen at one or more of the fires, ABC News reported.

Fallen star: A blaze ravaged the former home of Doors frontman Jim Morrison

West Hollywood Mayor John Duran 
heatedly spoke directly to the person or persons suspected of starting 
the fires, reports the LA Times.

'What
were you thinking?' he said. 'This is the most dense part of Los 
Angeles. If you’re trying to say something, this is not the way to say 
it.'

Authorities are now scouring 
surveillance footage across the area hit by Friday's fires in a bid to 
capture the arsonist who forced residents from their homes.

There
have been no civilian injuries but one city fireman was treated 
and released from a hospital after a fall while battling a blaze on Friday.

One of the blazes happened at the former home of late Doors lead singer Jim Morrison, who died in Paris in 1971 aged just 27.

He
used to live in the house with girlfriend Pamela Courson in the 1960s 
and it provided the inspiration for the Doors song ‘Love Street’.

The home was listed for nearly $1.2 million earlier this year, according to real estate website Zillow.com.

Witness Sandy Gendel said he heard explosions 
from what he later determined were likely car tires.

He saw flames 30 
feet high coming from the deck of the house and a gutted
Mazda Miata.

'It was just like a towering inferno,' Gendel said.

Other Hollywood residents recounted their fear as the fires spread.

'I
woke up really scared,’ evacuated resident Daniel Meza told KABC. ‘I 
heard somebody saying, “Fire, fire”. The smoke was in my face.’

Mr Meza had to run and get his little sister as well as wake up his parents and tell them all to get out of his block of flats.

‘It was a long, tough night,’ a Los 
Angeles County fire spokesman said, adding that the department does not 
yet have any suspect description.

'Thank
goodness no one was seriously injured or killed,” Mayor Antonio 
Villaraigosa said at an afternoon news conference on Friday, where he was joined 
by county and West Hollywood officials.

‘If you see something, say something,’ the L.A. County fire spokesman said.

County
supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky told Msnbc.com that the county is putting up
$25,000 and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is 
adding another $10,000.

Yaroslavsky added around $350,000 worth of damage was caused to property in West Hollywood by the fires on Friday alone.
