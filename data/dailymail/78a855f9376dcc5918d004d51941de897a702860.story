Warning: David Willetts said there had been a significant increase in grant applications from Romanian and Bulgarian students

Colleges have been hit with a surge in applications from Romanians and Bulgarians wanting taxpayer-funded loans and grants to study in this country.

More than 5,000 students from the two countries enrolled on vocational courses in England last year – accounting for a staggering one in six of all applicants – with many entitled to up to £10,000 in grants and loans.

Yesterday leaked documents exposed government concerns over 'weaknesses' in checks on applicants, prompting fears of potential mass fraud.

Ministers have now announced a freeze on new grants and revealed all applicants from the EU had been asked for extra evidence they were eligible for the cash.

One college – which officials have refused to name – has had all its funding stopped while an investigation is carried out.

Experts also raised fears that Romanian and Bulgarian students could make cash in hand at the expense of the taxpayer while studying for these courses, which officials admit have less stringent entrance criteria.

Currently students from the two countries are allowed to work limited hours in the UK but can avoid checks if they are self-employed or take black market jobs. But from January 1 they will have full rights to live and work here when EU controls expire.

Overall, numbers enrolling for higher national diplomas (HNDs) and certificates (HNCs) have more than doubled from 13,000 to 30,000 in only 12 months.

The rush of applications has left an £80million blackhole in the finances of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, which is responsible for higher education.

Officials have written to all EU applicants asking for evidence of their eligibility. But nearly three quarters are yet to respond.

The applications surge has apparently caught officials unprepared, and half of colleges have been sent a letter this week telling them to cap student numbers.

HNDs are equivalent to two years' study on a university course and can be used to gain entry to a university in England and Wales. HNCs are equal to one year of study in higher education.

The vocational qualifications can be taken in subjects including hair and beauty management, coaching and sporting development and applied biology.

EU residents can apply for a loan of up to £6,000 to cover the cost of tuition fees. Those already living in the UK are also entitled to a maximum £3,400 maintenance loan for living costs.

Around four in ten students receiving 
financial support for the qualifications are from abroad, compared to 
just one in 20 in higher education generally.

Details
of the problem emerged in a letter from chief executive of the Students
Loans Company, Mick Laverty, to a senior official at the Department for
Business.

He said: 'There 
may be legitimate reasons for this [surge] but as the weaknesses 
identified in the residency check process for Romanian and Bulgarian 
students may also be exploited by students from other European nations, 
these numbers are cause for concern.'

Professor
Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment 
Research at the University of Buckingham, said the courses provide a 
convenient route to government funding, adding: 'The students could be 
working in the black economy because the courses are not as demanding as
degrees.'

Sir Andrew 
Green, chairman of MigrationWatch said: 'This is a remarkably large 
number. It must surely be an indication of the kind of immigration 
pressures that we will face from these two countries.'

In
a written statement to Parliament yesterday, Universities Minister 
David Willetts said: 'We identified that there had been a significant 
increase in the number of Bulgarian and Romanian students applying for 
full student support in England this year.

'This support is usually only 
available to EU citizens resident in the UK for a minimum of three 
years.

'We have asked each 
of these students to supply additional information to support their 
applications for maintenance, before any further public funding is made 
available to them or to their institutions.

'We have asked all EU citizens applying for maintenance support in England to supply this additional information.'

Referring
to the college which has had its funding withdrawn, a Business 
Department spokesman said: 'The Student Loans Company is working with 
the college to confirm some details. While that process is going on we 
have suspended payments to the college and students.'
