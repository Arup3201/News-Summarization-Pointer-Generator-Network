A bald eagle rescued by a nature photographer from central Illinois has recovered and been returned to the wild, yet the man credited with saving him faces four misdemeanor charges of interfering with wildlife.

Steve Patterson has said he came across the two baby eagles and their nest knocked out of a tree in June 2013. One appeared to have been seriously wounded. 

So, he took them to his home in Oglesby, along the Illinois River, and called the nonprofit Flint Creek Wildlife Rehabilitation, which took them in. The second eagle is still in rehabilitation. 

Patterson's case has become a rallying point for those pushing for a state law to shield good Samaritans who help injured wildlife, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

Republican State Rep. Bob Pritchard, of Hinckley, has already filed Good Samaritan legislation for the session starting January 14, according to the newspaper.

'It's no different than a domesticated animal or even a human; if you have an injury and you can treat and rehabilitate, we ought to try and do that,' he told the Sun-Times. 

If convicted of all four misdemeanors, Patterson could spend 12 months behind bars, the newspaper reported. Steve Patterson's earlier trial had a hung jury - and his second, upcoming trial  is scheduled for February 23.

Patterson is accused of violating the state's wildlife code by taking the eagle chicks inside his residence, the Sun-Times reported. 

Good Samaritan? Steve Patterson is accused of violating Illinois' wildlife code by taking two eaglets into his residence back in June 2013Patterson is accused of violating the state's wildlife code by taking the eagle chicks inside his residence, the Sun-Times reported.

Patterson contacted the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) - but failed to tell the state agency the birds were inside his garage by the time it returned his call, the newspaper reported. The agency reportedly instructed Patterson to not disturb the eaglets.

Patterson contacted Flint Creek Wildlife Rehabilitation before hearing from DNR, according to The Chicago Sun-Times.

Dawn Keller, the director of Flint Creek, told the newspaper both eaglets suffered wing fractures. She stated that the male bird, Sam, was released on New Year's Day and and named 'in honor of the good Samaritan law that helped show us there was a dramatic need for.'

Keller said Patty will likely be released further down the road. She told The Chicago Sun-Times the female bird was named for Patterson. 

However, La Salle County State's Attorney Brian Towne has condemned Patterson's actions.

Speaking to The Chicago Sun-Times, Towne said 'He did more harm to that eaglet than he did good. Had Patterson not intervened with the experts dealing with the situation, that eaglet would not have had to be released after 18 months of incarceration.'

Patterson was convicted in Wisconsin of tampering with wildlife and previously faced off against conservation police, according to Towne.

'I just didn't want to see these two birds die on the ground,' Patterson told the Sun-Times.
