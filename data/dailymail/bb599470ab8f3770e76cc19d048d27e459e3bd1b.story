Real Madrid's Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez have starred alongside Barcelona's Lionel Messi in an advert revealing how they cope with fans giving them abuse during games.

All four players admitted that they do hear some of the tirades that have been sent in their direction but added that it is not something that bothers them.

'You hear some of the things being said but you are purely concentrated on the game and focused on doing what you are doing,' Bale said.

James Rodriguez  believes receiving criticism is all part of playing professional football

Messi said that abuse does not break his concentration levels when he is playing. 

'You focus on what you have to do, on playing, on doing things properly,' Messi said. 'We must go through it in every match but it's no problem.'

Madrid's France international striker Benzema said it helps him hit higher levels of performances during matches.

'When one is criticised, you demand more of yourself,' Benzema explained. 'I don't listen, I keep focused on the pitch, on what I must do, on my football.' 

'When you're not playing, they're always going to tell you about it,' Rodriguez added. 'That's the daily routine. I'm focused on what I have to do. I am only concentrating on the game. They are always going to talk, no matter what.' 

The advert was part of Adidas' advert for its new range of football boots.
