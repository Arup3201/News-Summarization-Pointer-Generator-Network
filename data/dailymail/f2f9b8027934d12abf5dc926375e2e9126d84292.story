A police officer who allegedly sent more than 800 tweets criticising his force and calling bosses 'lower than slime' has been sacked.

Tony Ryan, 33, was found to have sent tweets from @TheBritishCop - including posts labelling his officials 'scum' - despite denying that the Twitter site was his.

However, his seniors matched his tweets with his duties and ruled it must have been his.

PC Tony Ryan who has been sacked for allegedly running a Twitter page criticising Avon and Somerset police

PC Ryan, who was based in Filton and had 10 years service, was dismissed for gross misconduct after a Professional Standards Department (PSD) investigation carried out by Avon and Somerset Police. It is believed to be the first time the force has sacked someone because of their Twitter use'

He was dismissed for gross misconduct after a disciplinary panel decided on the 'balance of probability' he was the anonymous officer.

Ryan was found to have called professional standards officers 'lower than slime' and 'scum' and said bosses treated 'hard-working staff like garbage'.

The tweets, posted between March and October last year, criticised officers in Bristol and described management and resources as 'so bad'.

Investigators could not directly attribute the posts to him but decided they matched his 'intimate knowledge'.

But Mr Ryan, who has been with Avon and Somerset force for ten years, is adamant he has nothing to do with the account and has been 'hung out to dry' by an online impostor.

He said: 'My reaction is simply disbelief. I am, and always have been, 100 per cent innocent of this garbage and tried to conduct myself with dignity through the whole process.

'@TheBritishCop on Twitter has allowed them to hang me out to dry. Whoever they are can do what they like and get away with it, because I am their scapegoat.'

He was first accused of being behind the messages in October when officers from the professional standards department (PSD) presented him with print outs of the tweets.

He said he offered up his mobile phone, computers and email account to investigators to prove he was innocent - but the standards board did not take him up on the offer.

Instead an investigation was carried out by the force who decided the tweets matched the police officer's personal and professional experiences.

They said he was responsible for 'persistent undermining through social media of the leadership and function of Avon and Somerset Constabulary, so as to undermine confidence in the police'.

The panel concluded: 'We considered there to be sufficient strong indicators of the identity of @TheBritishCop to be PC Tony Ryan, supported by the weight of more general indicators of the identity as an officer with intimate knowledge of Avon and Somerset.'

The decision came despite a tweet from @TheBritishCop to deny they are even employed by Avon and Somerset Constabulary.

They tweeted: 'I know many Avon and Somerset and Devon and Cornwall officers, as well as a couple of Gloucestershire police officers.

It is not the first time Twitter has been used to apparently bemoan the bureaucracy of the police force.

A senior police inspector  working for an unnamed police force until last year blogged under the name Inspector Gadget detailing the often farcical nature of today's policing. 

Last year, Inspector Gadget, whose blog recorded more than 12 million hits, unexpectedly tweeted that he was 'going state 11' – off duty – and deleted postings dating back to 2006.

Another blogger,  NightJack, wrote an anonymous chronicle about his life as a Lancashire police officer.

But his identity was disclosed against his wishes by a national newspaper and he was reprimanded by his force.

And a conman who tweeted as a Metropolitan Police officer supposedly  tackling London riots was jailed for five years.

Ellis Ward, 29, of Bishops's Cleeve, near Cheltenham, had also conned three women out of a total of £42,000 and posed as an army major injured in Iraq.

His 'riots' tweets - in which he claimed he was helping combat riots in Tottenham and Croydon -  were followed by 3,000 people including newspapers.

'What they've done to the officer in A&S is a disgrace. They will no doubt do the same to me if I go public.'

Chief Inspector Kevan Rowlands, the deputy head of PSD, said: 'Our attention was drawn to inappropriate and offensive comments being made on social media between March and October last year, which were suspected to have been posted by a serving police officer.

'Following an internal investigation, a misconduct hearing was held. As a result, the officer was dismissed.'

He said tweeting officers have to adhere to a code of ethics and added: 'We will not tolerate any offensive or inappropriate comments being made on social media by our staff - whether at work or outside. This will result in us looking into the matter and may result in criminal action or possible misconduct enquiries.'

Mr Ryan is now planning to take his case to the Police Appeal Tribunal.
