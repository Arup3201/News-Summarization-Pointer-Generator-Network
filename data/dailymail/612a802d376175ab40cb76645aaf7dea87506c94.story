One of the two Chris Christie aides revealed in a newly-released report to have been romantically involved leading up to last year's traffic closures is fighting back.

The lawyer for Bridget Anne Kelly, who infamously sent an email saying 'time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee', and whose judgement was called into question after a failed relationship Christie's former campaign manager Bill Stepien, slammed the findings of the Bridgegate inquiry.

Attorney Michael Critchley said in a statement to the Star-Ledger that 'the report's venomous, gratuitous, and inappropriate sexist remarks concerning Ms. Kelly have no place in what is alleged to be a professional and independent report.'

Under examination: Bridget Anne Kelly, the Christie aide who sent the infamous 'time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee' email, was reportedly dating one of her colleagues for months before the scandal

The report released by a law firm 
Christie hired to investigate the scandal, said that the two had been a 
couple for months but had called things off a month before the George 
Washington Bridge lane closures.

Critchely called the report 'a preemptive strike' meant to 'isolate Ms Kelly and impugn her credibility,'

'Ms. Kelly is not a liar,' the statement continued. 'She is a single mother of four children who was deeply devoted and committed to her job at the Office of the Governor.

'She worked tirelessly to pursue the goals of the Office during her tenure.'

Stepien, 36, worked as the Republican governor's deputy chief of staff and then when he left the post in April to become Christie's campaign manager, he was replaced by Kelly, 41.

'At
 some point after Stepien’s departure to run the campaign, Kelly and 
Stepien became personally involved, although, by early August 2013, 
their personal relationship had cooled, apparently at Stepien’s choice, 
and they largely stopped speaking,' the report by Randy Mastro states. 

'Because Stepien was her "benefactor," Kelly relied heavily on him during this transition' ahead of their August break up.

The
 report also concluded that the governor was not involved in a plot to 
create gridlock near a major bridge as part of a political retribution 
scheme.

The taxpayer-funded 
report released by Mastro, a former federal prosecutor, relies on 
interviews with Christie and other officials in his administration and 
250,000 documents, many of them emails and text messages.

'We
 found that Governor Christie had no knowledge beforehand of this George 
Washington Bridge realignment idea,' Mastro said at a news conference.

His report comes out ahead of any results from independent investigations by federal prosecutors and a special committee of state lawmakers.

Some of the key figures would not cooperate with Mastro's investigation, leading Democrats to question the credibility of the report and its thoroughness.

Assembly Select Committee on Investigation Co-Chair John Wisniewski released a statement effectively calling the report an attempt by Christie to move past the issue without critically examining the scandal.

'Lawyers hired by and paid by the Christie administration itself to investigate the governor’s office who then say the governor and most of his office did nothing wrong will not be the final word on this matter,' he said in a statement.

During a media conference call Thursday, Wisniewski said that the mention of Kelly and Stepien's romantic entanglements was 'irrelevant' especially because neither were interviewed for the report so there was no clear connection between their love life and the lane closures.

'It is very difficult to tell who is telling the truth when you don't hear from both sides,' he said.

'It reads more like a novel than a work of fact.'

Defending the report at a news conference Thursday, Mastro said, 'We believe we have gotten to the truth or we wouldn't be reporting it.'

The September closure of lanes near the bridge that caused four days of massive gridlock in the community of Fort Lee have become a major scandal for Christie, a possible 2016 Republican presidential contender.

Christie said on a radio show Wednesday that the events will not affect his decisions about his political future.

In his view: Governor Christie's office hired Randy Mastro, a former federal prosecutor, to investigate the scandal and the report released Thursday declares clears Christie of wrongdoing

The lawyer hired by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to review a traffic-blocking scandal that has engulfed Christie's administration released this report which a published report said clears the governor of any role in the plot

The report, issued at Mastro's New York law office, concludes that former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey official David Wildstein and ex-Christie aide Bridget Kelly were behind the closures and that they were targeting Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich.

But it did not conclude why they wanted to hurt the Democrat and said there was no evidence that it was because he refused to endorse Christie for re-election last year.

Mastro says that Kelly, who did not cooperate with the report, tried to cover her tracks when Christie began asking what happened last year by asking a colleague to delete an email about the plot but the other staffer retained the email anyway, the report says.

Mastro also says that Wildstein suggested he mentioned traffic issues in Fort Lee to Christie at public event during the lane realignment.

Wildstein says Christie did not recall it being brought up and if it was, it would not have registered as significant to Christie — something Christie has said before.

The report also finds that a claim by Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer, that Christie's administration told her that Superstorm Sandy would be tied to a private redevelopment plan, is 'demonstrably false'.

A spokesman for Zimmer did not immediately return a call.

Mastro calls for Christie's office staffers to cease using personal email accounts for official business, eliminating the office where Kelly had worked and appointing an ethics officer in the governor's office.

He also recommends major changes to the structure of Port Authority, an agency jointly run by the states of New York and New Jersey.
