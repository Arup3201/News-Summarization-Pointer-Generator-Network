Mauricio Pochettino would be forgiven for having some concerns that the referee who started the Jose Mourinho ‘campaign’ eight weeks ago — when cautioning Cesc Fabregas for diving when he was clearly fouled — is taking charge of Sunday's League Cup final.

It is Anthony Taylor’s first Chelsea match since he apologised to Chelsea for that.

Taylor won’t be concerned as he steps out at Wembley but, however strong mentally he feels he is, there must be some level of trepidation at how he will react when (and not if) Chelsea have a penalty appeal.

Referees have two ways of dealing with this kind of pressure: they either avoid all contact with any form of the media and go into games unaware and unconcerned by the hype, or they prepare by accepting the pressure that this game brings and work to ensure that they have the coping mechanisms to deal with any ‘baggage’ from previous incidents — theirs or those of their colleagues.

Taylor is a good referee, sometimes a very good referee. Mentally he is very strong and has the use of a sports psychologist if he feels the need to refer to him.

I hope that he is strong enough because Mourinho — the undoubted master of the dark arts — will have his players fully briefed to exploit any weakness. He believes that is fair game, particularly when silverware is at stake.

Jose Mourinho is clearly unhappy with the decision after seeing one of his players booked for simulation
