President Barack Obama spoke out for the first time since General David Petraeus resigned from his post as CIA director in the wake of the extra martial affair that has resulted in the unravelling scandal, saying that he does not think the country is in danger of a threat from any leaked intelligence.

'I have no evidence at this point from what I’ve seen that classified information was disclosed that would have in any way have had an impact on our national security,' the President said.

He went on to focus on Petraeus' legacy before his affair with biographer Paula Broadwell was unveiled, saying that it was a matter for the four-star general and his family.

'By his own assessment, he did not meet the standards that he felt were necessary as the director of CIA with respect to this personal matter that he is now dealing with with his family and with his wife.

'And it’s on that basis that he tendered his resignation, and it’s on that basis that I accepted it. But I want to emphasize that, from my perspective at least, he has provided this country an extraordinary service.

'We are safer because of the work that Dave Petraeus has done. And my main hope right now is — is that he and his family are able to move on and that this ends up being a single side note on what has otherwise been an extraordinary career' he said.

'My hope right now is that he and his family are able to move and that this ends up being a single side note on what has otherwise been an extraordinary career.'

One of the tricky areas for the President is whether or not he should have been notified about the then-ongoing investigation before the election.

Focusing on the positive: Obama said that he hoped that by the end of the investigation the scandal would just be a side note to the legacy of Petraeus' long career

He said that he did feel it appropriate to 'meddle' in the FBI's process, referring all further logistical questions about the timeline of the investigation.

'I am withholding judgment with respect to how the entire process surrounding General Petraeus came up. We don’t have all the information yet, but I want to say I have a lot of confidence generally in the FBI,' he said.

When asked by NBC's Chuck Todd whether he felt that he- and voters- should have been told earlier than November 8: 'It is also possible that had we been told, you'd be sitting here asking why we were interfering with a criminal investigation.'

The White House first learned about the investigation into Petraeus' affair with Paula Broadwell- and the ensuing chain of harassing emails from Broadwell to another four-star general and a possible love rival- on Wednesday November 7, the day after Obama was re-elected.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told unspecified staffers at the White House on Wednesday, telling them that there was a chance that the CIA director may resign. President Obama himself was not actually told anything about the investigation until Thursday.

The President spoke with Petraeus that day, but did not immediately accept his resignation. He waited until Friday to allow him to quit, and it was announced publicly that same day.
