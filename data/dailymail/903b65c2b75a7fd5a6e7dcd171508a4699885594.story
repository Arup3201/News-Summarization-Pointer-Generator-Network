A former consultant at the hospital where Jimmy Savile had an office was last night charged with carrying out five sex attacks.

Dr Michael Salmon, who worked at the world-renowned Stoke Mandeville Hospital is accused of rape and four counts of indecent assault.

The 78-year-old is alleged to have carried out the attacks in hospitals across Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, over a 13-year period between 1972 and 1983.

Accused: Dr Michael Salmon, 78, who is charged with rape and four counts of indecent assault

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said the charges stemmed from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree - the investigation into the Jimmy Saville abuse scandal.

Salmon, from Woodgreen, Hampshire, was arrested by detectives yesterday and then later charged.

He has been bailed to appear at Aylesbury Magistrates' Court on December 17.

The doctor was praised in 1987 by Princess Diana for arranging a trip to Disney World in Florida for 300 disabled children.

A
 police spokesman said: 'We have charged a 78-year-old man with one 
count of rape and four counts of indecent assault following advice from 
the Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service.

'Michael Salmon, from Woodgreen, was arrested on November 20 and charged the same day.

Operation Yewtree is the national investigation prompted after claims were made against the disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile.

Scotland
 Yard has led the probe, and separated its inquiries into those 
involving Savile, those involving Savile and others, and those involving
 others.

including Stoke Mandeville

Inquiry: Hundreds of Jimmy Savile victims have now come forward to tell police about his crimes

Entertainer Rolf Harris, former Radio 1 
DJ Dave Lee Travis and PR consultant Max Clifford are among the high 
profile figures already arrested and charged with sex offences following
 Operation Yewtree.

They all deny wrongdoing.

Comedian Jim Davidson, who was arrested in January, learned in the summer that he would not be charged.

Paul Gambaccini last week admitted he was the latest celebrity to be arrested by detectives investigating the Savile scandal.

Fellow entertainer Freddie Starr remains on police bail, as prosecutors decide whether to charge him.

Former pop star Gary Glitter is also waiting to learn his fate after his arrest. Gambaccini was the 15th suspect to be arrested under Operation Yewtree.

Police confirmed another man, aged 74, was arrested as part of the investigation. Both men have been bailed to a date in early January.
