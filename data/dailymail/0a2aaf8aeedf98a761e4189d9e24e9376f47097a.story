For most of us, one heart will last a lifetime. Summer Carss, however, is on her third – and she has only just turned four.

The youngster has had two transplant operations after being born with a heart that did not work properly.

The most recent operation took place 12 months ago and so far it has been a case of third time lucky. The organ seems to be working well and, much to the relief of her parents, Summer is now living life to the full.

'so inspirational': Four-year-old Summer Carss has had two heart transplant operations after being born with an organ that did not work properly

It is extremely rare for such a young child to have had two heart transplants and she could even be the youngest ever.

Her mother Julie Carss, 31, a former nursery nurse, said: ‘Summer is an amazing little girl. Nothing scares her and that is what has helped get her through.

‘This time last year we were at her bedside. When we look back it’s hard to think that we got through it, but we’re quite positive people and hopefully that rubbed off on our daughter.’

At three months old Summer, from Alnwick, Northumberland, was diagnosed with aortic stenosis, a condition which means the valve on the left side of her heart does not open properly.

She had two heart operations to tackle the problem, but when she was about a year old she got a cold which developed into pneumonia.

In January 2012 she had a cardiac arrest and was admitted to intensive care at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital. She went to the top of the transplant list, but had to wait nine months for a suitable heart to become available.

Mrs Carss said: ‘It was horrendous waiting for a heart as you pray for the day that you get the call to say one has become available.

‘But at the back of your mind you’re always thinking about the other family as you know someone has had to say goodbye to their child. We are so grateful to the donors and their families.’

The transplant was a success. However, a year later the family were given the devastating news that scans had revealed coronary artery disease.

‘It was a shock to be told Summer needed another heart transplant and we’d have to go through it all again,’ said Mrs Carss. This time it took three months for a donor organ to be found before she could be given a transplant.

Mrs Carss and her husband Paul, 37, a warehouse worker, hope their traumas are now behind them. ‘It has been a difficult few years but we’ve got to the end of the rocky road,’ said Mrs Carss. ‘We have a beautiful little girl who is so inspirational. Twice we thought we were going to lose Summer and we know of people whose child has not made it to the first heart transplant so we’re very lucky that our daughter has had two.’

Lynne Holt, transplant co-ordinator at the Freeman Hospital, said: ‘It is very unusual for a child to have two heart transplants.’
