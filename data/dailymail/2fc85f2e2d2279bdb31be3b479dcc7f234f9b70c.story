This is the moment a brushtail possum gets caught 'bread-handed' as it gets distracted in the kitchen during a home invasion. 

The critter, native to Australia, was filmed by YouTube user Alex Steel as it nibbled away on a loaf.

After repeatedly telling the critter it must leave, Steel takes a wooden spoon to its derriere, forcing it out of the window. 

It takes almost three minutes to get rid of the gutsy late-night intruder.

When hunger calls: YouTube user Alex Steel caught a possum 'bread-handed' when it got distracted in the kitchen during a home invasion

As the hungry possum moves outdoors into the darkness, it keeps the piece of bread firmly gripped in its paws. 

'What you doing?' Steel is heard saying when he first encounters the creature.

He then kindly asks it to 'vacate the premises.'

When the possum fails to obey his orders, Steel brings out the spoon. 

'I know it's a nice bit of bread but you've just got to move along,' he says, tapping it gently. 

Gutsy: The possum refused to leave Steel's kitchen as it pecked away on a loaf of bread

So long, buster! Finally Steel used a wooden cooking spoon to coax the critter outside 

'I want to go to bed. You're nocturnal, this isn't fair.'

The possum attempts to amble into the kitchen at one point but gets stuck in between a toaster and kettle.

Finally Steel manages to point it in the right direction by nudging it with the wooden cooking implement.

'You've been evicted.' he says victoriously as the bandit returns to its natural habitat with its loot in tow.

To date, Steel's video titled 'So I was a victim of a home invasion last night' has been watched more than 65,000 times.

'This is the cutest home invasion I have ever seen,' one viewer exclaimed after watching the greedy possum in action.
