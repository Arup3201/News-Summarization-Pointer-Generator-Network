The Premier League cash cow is set to produce a record £4billion deal when the television broadcast rights for 2016-19 are sold on Tuesday.

But Sportsmail can reveal the staggering extent to which the Premier League already dwarfs Europe's other big leagues in terms of TV cash earnings, even before the new deal.

England's top flight rakes in so much money that Manchester United earned over three times more than German champions Bayern Munich last season - and even Cardiff City, who finished bottom of the league and were relegated, took home double that of the Bundesliga giants.

Cardiff were relegated from the Premier League last season but earned twice as much TV money as Bayern

The Bluebirds' limp fight against the drop earned them £62.1million while Pep Guardiola's juggernaught were awarded £27.34m. Just as remarkably, Cardiff also raked in around double the amount of Atletico Madrid, last year's La Liga champions. Diego Simeone's side were just the fourth-top earners in Spain, behind Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, with £31.12m.

United, despite finishing outside of the Premier League's top four, also easily outstripped Bayern. The embarrassment of falling from champions to flops under David Moyes didn't prevent £89.2m from flooding into the coffers at Old Trafford.

Perhaps even more staggering is that United and Everton both earned more from the Premier League than the combined total awarded by the Bundesliga to the three teams other than Bayern who qualified for the Champions League. Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke took home a combined £75.88m, while the Toffees pocketed £85m.

Liverpool, who finished second, earned far more than Manchester United who struggled under David Moyes

Real Madrid earned more than £100million, the same as Barcelona, but three times as much as rivals Atletico

Liverpool (£97.5m) earned the most TV money of any Premier League club last season, despite being pipped by Manchester City (£96.6m) to the title. Chelsea were third-top earners with £94.6m. 

And all three English giants earned more than the three top-earning clubs in France's Ligue 1 combined. Those French 'minnows' are PSG, Marseille and Lyon.

The money awarded to English clubs is, strictly speaking, derived from Premier League central funds. The vast majority of this is TV money, but each club is also awarded £4,270,850 from central commercial income. That includes revenue from the likes of Barclays' sponsorship of the league and Nike, who sponsor the matchballs. 

Bayern have long been Germany's dominant club but earn only slightly more than Borussia Dortmund

Earnings of close to £30m have not prevented Dortmund facing a relegation battle this season

The huge sums handed down to even the most underachieving Premier League clubs make for staggering reading, but so too does the vast inequality between the haves and have-nots in Spain. Simply, that means Real Madrid and Barcelona on one side and every other club on the other.

Real and Barca both trousered a whopping £103.74m last season, which makes them Europe's chief beneficiaries from domestic TV broadcast rights. The five lowest earners in La Liga - Granada, Elche, Valladolid, Rayo Vallecano and Almeria - all took home just £13.34m last term. That means Real and Barca scooped almost eight times more than the Spanish strugglers.

By contrast, although each Premier League club is awash with cash, the differential from top to bottom is much fairer. Liverpool were handed 1.6 times more money than Cardiff last season.

Juventus continued their domination of Serie A last season, and also earned £10m more than Inter Milan

Spanish daily AS are reporting that the LFP, the body in charge of La Liga and the Spanish second division, want to address the huge gulf between top and bottom by selling their TV rights centrally, rather than letting Real and Barca negotiate their own separate deals.

The aim is for the lowest-earning La Liga club to take home no less than £29.7m per season. That would be more than third-placed Valencia were given last season, and more than Bayern and PSG reaped in winning their domestic leagues.

But with Sky Sports and BT Sport set to up their bids for Premier League TV broadcast rights amid competition from Discovery and beIN sport, even that figure will look paltry compared with the embarrassment of riches in England.
