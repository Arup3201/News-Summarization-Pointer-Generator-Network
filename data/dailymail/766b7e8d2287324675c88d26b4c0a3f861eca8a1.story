The 20-year-old mother who abandoned her baby girl on a sweltering Manhattan subway platform unleashed a bizarre expletive-ridden rant at Jay-Z during a court appearance.

Frankea Dabbs, who moved to New York from North Carolina just days ago, has been charged with abandoning a child after she left her 10-month-old daughter, Milani Edmonds, alone on a train platform at Columbus Circle on Monday morning.

Relatives said that Dabbs, who was homeless after arriving in New York on July 2, had been plagued with troubles in North Carolina, including possible mental health issues and witnessing the killing of her baby's father.

Arrest: Dabbs, 20, said that she left the child alone because she was overwhelmed with caring for her

In an appearance at Manhattan Criminal
 Court on Tuesday she turned to a television camera and verbally attacked Brooklyn 
rapper Jay-Z, real name Shawn Corey Carter, according to the New York Post.

She said: ‘Is that rolling? Tell Shawn Corey Carter I said f*** him. Piece of s***.’

Earlier,
 NYPD spokesman Stephen Davis said: 'She felt she couldn’t take care of 
the baby and thought she was leaving her in a safe public space,'

Dabbs was forced to cower under the bed in their home in Clinton, North 
Carolina as masked intruders shot the father of her baby dead, her 
father Franklin Dabbs told the New York Daily News.

'She was there hiding under the bed,' he said. 'I told her, "It could have been you".'

Relatives
 said they also believed she was battling mental health issues and said 
she was recently kicked out of her stepfather's home for insisting on 
always having the lights switched off.

'Stuff
 is wrong with Frankea's mind,' her aunt Lawanna Edmonds said. 'She walks around 
with dark shades... She even sleeps in dark shades.'

Found: Dabbs was arrested after she was spotted by a passerby who recognized her from cop information

Online 
records and mug shots also show she has previously been arrested for possession 
of marijuana, assaulting an officer, breaking and entering and 
solicitation for prostitution.

On
 Tuesday, Dabbs was found around 12.30am near 72nd Street and Broadway 
after a passerby recognized her from security footage and alerted a 
nearby police officer, DNAinfo reported.

She allegedly admitted to the officer that she was the mother of the baby girl and was able to provide her name, age and medical history.

On Tuesday, she was pictured being hauled in handcuffs to her arraignment by NYPD Transit Robbery Squad detectives.

On Monday morning, Dabbs had allegedly
 pushed the baby's stroller from a
 northbound 1 train at Columbus Circle before darting back inside the 
train.

Surveillance
 footage released by the NYPD showed the woman entering the subway with 
the baby in the stroller earlier in the day, but there were no cameras 
on the platform where the incident occurred.

Mother: Police released surveillance footage
 of the woman, identified as Frankea Dabbs, suspected of abandoning the baby as she pushed the little girl in her stroller through the subway station earlier that day

Held: The woman, pictured in another frame with her daughter, was taken in to police custody on Tuesday

A
 33-year-old bystander saw the baby alone on the platform and stayed 
with her for about 20 minutes, waiting for the woman to return.

When no one came to claim the child, the witness contacted the MTA who took the baby to Transit District 1 Police Station.

The baby was then taken to St Luke’s Roosevelt hospital for evaluation before she was handed over to the NYC Administration for Children's Services.

The girl 
had a rash on her face and bandages on her hand but is said to be in 
good condition. She was reportedly wearing a red and white blouse with 
red leggings and pampers.

Authorities believe the mother left her there intentionally because no one came forward to claim the baby girl.

Patricia 
Floro, 44, who got off the train at the station with her two-year-old 
daughter in a stroller, told the Daily News it appeared like a desperate
 act.

'She
 must have her reasons for doing that. I mean something else is going 
on, something deeper that would make her do that,' Floro said.
