Former BBC director general Mark Thompson has accused the chairman of the BBC Trust of 'fundamentally misleading' Parliament

Former BBC director  general Mark Thompson has accused the chairman of the BBC Trust of ‘fundamentally misleading’ Parliament over the severance pay scandal, leaked documents reveal.

In an extraordinary submission to the Commons public accounts committee (PAC), he accused Lord Patten of peddling ‘specific untruths and inaccuracies’ over the extent of his knowledge of huge payoffs to senior executives.

On Monday, Mr Thompson – who is now chief executive of the New York Times – will appear before MPs with Lord Patten to explain the debacle, in which departing BBC staff were paid £369million over eight years.

In a 25-page statement provided to the committee this week, Mr Thompson challenged evidence given by his former colleague to an earlier hearing in July.

Lord Patten has consistently denied the Trust was aware of the details of severance payoffs and has suggested the Corporation’s governance body was misled over the issue.

But Mr Thompson said: ‘The picture painted for the PAC by the BBC Trust witnesses on 10 July 2013 was – in addition to specific untruths and inaccuracies – fundamentally misleading about the extent of Trust knowledge and involvement.

‘The insinuation that they were kept in the dark by me or anyone else is false and is not supported by the evidence.’

Mr Thompson claims to have emails showing Lord Patten was wrong to tell MPs he ‘didn’t know’ about two huge payments to departing executives – a £1.02milion payout to former deputy director general Mark Byford in 2011 and a £390,000 settlement reached with Sharon Baylay, the former director of marketing.

Mr Thompson said that Lord  Patten was told both had received more than they were contractually entitled to.

He said: ‘In fact, Lord Patten was himself fully briefed, in writing as well as orally, about the Mark Byford and Sharon Baylay settlements soon after his arrival as chairman in 2011.’ Mr Thompson also accused the BBC Trust of withholding key information from the National Audit Office’s investigation into severance payoffs.

The BBC’s under-fire HR boss has admitted making a mistake in her evidence to Parliament over excessive pay-offs to senior staff.

Lucy Adams initially told a hearing of the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that she had not seen a note detailing plans for pay-offs to deputy director general Mark Byford and marketing boss Sharon Baylay.

But she has now admitted she helped write it.

Ms Adams, who announced last month she was quitting the BBC, said in written evidence published today: 'During the July 10 hearing, the chair referred to a memo of October 7 2010.

'At the time, I was not clear which document the chair was referring to and so I could not recollect with absolute certainty whether or not I had seen the memo sent by Mark Thompson to the then chairman on October 7 2010. 

'Since the hearing, I am now clear which document was being referred to and I can confirm that I was involved in drafting that memo, although I had not seen the final note sent to the Trust until recently.'

He said evidence given to the NAO and the PAC in July was ‘inadequate, and in some important instances, very misleading testimony’.

The public spending watchdog revealed this year that the BBC paid £25million to 150 departing bosses between 2009 and 2012. 

This week after further scrutiny of the BBC accounts, the NAO said the broadcaster paid out a total of £2.9million in payments that went beyond contractual entitlement between 2006 and 2012.

In a humiliating U-turn on Wednesday, the BBC Trust was forced to reveal it had been shown a secret memo – codenamed Project Silver – detailing plans to pay Mr Byford far more than it was contractually entitled to.

It is expected MPs will put pressure on Lord Patten to explain why the Trust, which has a responsibility to make sure the BBC meets its Charter obligations, failed to get a grip on the issue despite being made aware of the wrongdoing.  

Mr Thompson said: ‘The BBC Trust witnesses failed to mention the warning I had given them about misleading the PAC, or the extent to which they themselves had been briefed about these cases.

Nor did they explain, given how much outrage they claimed to feel and how much they actually knew about the cases, why they did nothing about senior management severance until they themselves came under criticism for the payment made to [former BBC director general] George Entwistle.’

Speaking before details about Mr Thompson’s evidence to the committee had been made public, PAC chairman Margaret Hodge said she had seen evidence of ‘total chaos’ at the BBC.

Asked by Radio 4’s Media Show if she thought the committee had previously been misled, Hodge said: ‘We will have to discover that next Monday. 

‘Certainly those individuals we are having in front of us don’t agree with each other on what happened or who knew what and until we can unravel that we won’t know whether or not we were misled.’

Also giving evidence on Monday will be former Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons and Marcus Agius, the former chairman of the BBC Executive Board Remuneration Committee which was responsible for approving significant payoffs.

Last night a BBC Trust spokesman hit back at Mr Thompson’s account, saying: ‘This is a bizarre document. 

‘We reject the suggestion that Lord Patten and Anthony Fry misled the PAC. 

‘We completely disagree with Mark Thompson’s analysis, much of which is unsubstantiated, in particular the suggestion that Lord Patten was given a full and formal briefing on the exact terms of Mark Byford’s departure, which in any event took place before the current chairman’s arrival at the Trust.

‘It remains the case, as noted by the NAO in its original report, both that the Trust under the chairmanship of Sir Michael Lyons was told that these payments were within contractual terms and that the Trust did not have a role in the approval process. 

‘The Trust has already published its own account of events, which took place well before Lord Patten’s arrival, and we look forward to answering fully and openly further questions at Monday’s PAC hearing. 

‘For Lord Patten and Anthony Fry the overriding concern remains the best interests and good standing of the BBC.’
