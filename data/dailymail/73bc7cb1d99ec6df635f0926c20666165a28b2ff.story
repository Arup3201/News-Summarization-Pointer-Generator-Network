The Queen appeared in much better health as she arrived to sign the Commonwealth charter

The Queen signed the Commonwealth's historic charter tonight despite still recovering from the symptoms of gastroenteritis.

Making her first official public appearance for more than a week she 
described the document as capturing 'the core values and aspirations' of
the family of nations, before putting her name to it.

The Queen was forced to miss the annual Commonwealth Day service this afternoon as she was still recovering.

But she looked well and in good spirits when she arrived at Marlborough 
House in central London, home of the Commonwealth, with the Duke of 
Edinburgh for the signing.

Before the ceremony began she told guests who included High 
Commissioners from across the globe: 'The Charter I will sign today, on 
behalf of you all, represents a significant milestone as the 
Commonwealth continues its journey of development and renewal.

'We have now, for the first time, a single document that captures the 
core values and aspirations of the Commonwealth and all its members.'

For the first time one document has been agreed by the 54 member states 
which enshrines a comprehensive range of principles and values, from 
gender equality to rule of law.

But it has proved controversial among gay rights groups with the words 'other grounds' under the human rights topic being seized upon by 
activists, with one group claiming the Queen is supporting lesbian and 
gay issues, while another suggests she has made no commitment to gay 
equality.

The charter states: 'We are implacably opposed to all forms of 
discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political
belief or other grounds.'

The Queen had been due to attend the Commonwealth Day Observance at London's Westminster Abbey that saw High Commissioners from across the globe in the congregation and a key-note address from Sir Richard Branson.

Her husband the Duke of Edinburgh was the only senior royal representative.

The monarch, who turns 87 next month,  spent 24 hours in hospital last week being treated for the illness which leaves sufferers with vomiting and diarrhoea.

Buckingham Palace had said on Friday that the Queen would attend today's service and it was 'business as usual'.

The 86-year-old was struck down by 
the stomach bug just over a week ago and spent last Sunday night at the 
private King Edward VII's Hospital in central London before being 
discharged on Monday.

Concerns were raised about the 
Queen's general well-being as it was the first time she had been 
admitted to hospital in almost 10 years.

But she left the hospital looking well and cheerful.

Her engagements for last week were cancelled, including a brief visit to Rome to meet Italy's president.

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: 
'This time last week she was in hospital but she's in great spirits and 
apart from this is in good health.

'It's just the tail end of the symptoms, her condition has not worsened at all.'

The Palace announced the cancellation in a short statement: 'The Queen will regrettably no longer attend the Commonwealth Observance at Westminster Abbey today as she continues to recover following her recent illness.'

It added: 'The Queen hopes to undertake some of her official engagements planned for the rest of this week.'Â
