A five-year old boy was raped in the toilets of a prestigious international school in Jakarta International, reports today suggest.

It is alleged the boy, who is thought to have turned six last week, was attacked in the toilets of the Jakarta International School by two cleaning staff wearing blue uniforms.

The pair twice attacked the boy during school hours in the bathroom nearest to his classroom, reports suggest.

Indonesian security officers stand guard in front of the Jakarta International School - where the alleged rape of the boy, then five, is said to have taken place

It is thought the boy contracted herpes and a bacterial infection during the horrific attack.

The staff, who are believed to be employees of contract cleaners ISS, are now in police custody following the attacks in February and March - according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

Officers in Jakarta have said two other men and one woman are also under investigation. 

The boy is reportedly the son of a Dutch father and an Indonesian mother.

The mother decided to go public with the details of her child's attack after the school was slow to act following the allegations, she says.

Reports suggest the boy was attacked by two out-sourced cleaning staff in the bathroom near to his classroom on two occasions in February and March

The family's lawyer Andi Asrun has said the boy's parents believe the school should have been aware of the boy's absence from class -  and his teachers should have noticed he was in distress when he rejoined the class.

The lawyer told the newspaper the child was locked inside a janitors' closet during his ordeal so his screams could not be heard.

The school's head, Tim Carr, says the school has made security changes and installed CCTV cameras following the horrendous attacks. He added the school was cooperating with the authorities.

In a letter to parents, the school said outsourced staff now had restricted access to the school - and that ISS staff no longer worked on campus.

Police have asked parents to monitor their child's behaviour and to report anything suspicious to officers.

The Jakarta Education Agency has similarly notified all local schools of the attack and advised them to improve security measures.
