An estate agent in Wales has whipped up a treat for those in the market for a new house - the former summer home of the family behind the Bird's custard empire, which has gone up for sale for £595,000.

Villagers can remember the eccentric Bird family arriving at the country house in a fleet of custard yellow Rolls Royces.

The Birds used the property in the Welsh hills as a fishing and hunting lodge during the summer months. And more than 100 years later it is being advertised as perfect holiday home for anyone who wants to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.

The house was built with the vast fortune the family made from the housewife's favourite custard powder which is egg-free. It was invented in Birmingham by chemist Sir Alfred Bird in 1837 because his wife was allergic to eggs.

The Birds built Plas Tanat, near Welshpool, Mid Wales, to join the wealthy Victorian set on weekend hunting and shooting parties.

Sir Alfred and other wealthy businessmen set up the local fishing club on the River Tanat and Rhaeadr.

Plas Tanat - Tanat Place in English - still has its own fishing rights which come with the asking price of £595,000.

House about that: The summer home of the family behind the Bird's custard empire is up for sale and is positioned right next to a river in Wales

Country living: The five-bedroomed house is near Welshpool, in mid Wales, and comes with its own fishing rights

Rural idyll: The house stayed in the Bird family until 1970 when it was sold to a local buyer

To the manor lawn: The house comes with a beautifully landscaped garden

Keen: Estate agent Victoria Pocock said there has been a lot of interest in the property, describing it as a 'gem, with a fascinating history'

Grand: The new owners will enjoy a wood-panelled living room - but sadly the furniture isn't part of the deal

Llife on the wild side: The Bird family mainly used the house as a fishing and hunting lodge

Food for thought: The kitchen is more than ample in size, with plenty of room to whip up some Bird's custard

Dream property: The country air will definitely help with a good night's sleep - and so will the spacious and comfy bedrooms

Quaint: The estate agent said that there are 'arts and crafts influences running through the house'

Stately: Even the bathroom features angled timber work

Water sight: A wooden walkway crosses the river from the house's front garden

Relaxing retreat: The house is set in gloriously tranquil countryside

Gill-seekers: Sir Alfred Bird set up a fishing club nearby and little wonder, as the river is perfect for peaceful angling

Sight to behold: The mansion is one of the grandest houses in the area

The benevolent Birds also donated money towards the building of the village hall in 1926, and gave a cottage to their gardener as a thank you for his hard work

Clever: Bird's Custard was invented in 1837 - by Sir Alfred Bird

Bird's Custard was invented way back in 1837 in Birmingham by Sir Alfred Bird, who was egged on by the fact that his wife was allergic to eggs - which has always traditionally been one of the product's key ingredients, used to help thicken it.

Mr Bird used cornflour instead of egg to create an imitation of custard. It was originally intended only for his wife. It was only when the custard was accidentally fed to guests that Mr Bird realised that his invention had a wider use.

Soon afterwards he founded Alfred Bird and Sons Ltd, which would go on to become the famous Bird’s Custard company and brand.

Bird was not content to revolutionise custard but went on to invent baking powder - he formulated it in 1843 so he could make yeast-free bread for his wife.

By 1844 the company, which had a factory in Digbeth, Birmingham, was promoting custard powder nationally and making baking powder, too.

Alfred Bird died on December 15 1878 and is buried at Key Hill Cemetery in Birmingham.

Famously his obituary in the journal of the Chemical Society, of which he was a fellow, discussed at length his skills and research but did not mention his other activity – the by then famous Bird’s Custard.

His son, Alfred Frederick Bird, continued the work of his father. Bird junior went on to invent egg substitute powder in 1890, blancmange powder and jelly powder.

Captain Scott took Bird’s products on his ill-fated Antarctic expedition in 1912 and in World War I, Bird's Custard was supplied to the British armed forces.

The company was one of the early users of promotional items and colourful advertising campaigns.

The famous 'three bird' logo, however, was relatively late in arriving, only introduced in 1929. World War II saw rationing and serious 
production limits.

Shortly after the war, Bird's was purchased by the 
General Foods Corporation, which was itself taken over by Phillip Morris
 in the 1980s and merged into Kraft Foods.

Although the Bird's Custard 
product remains, the company itself is now just a brand.

Production was relocated to Banbury in 1964, along with the factory gates, featuring the company logo. In 1981, a dust explosion occurred at the Banbury factory when corn starch powder mixed with air, forming an explosive mixture which blew out one of the factory walls.

In late 2004, 
Kraft sold Bird's Custard and some other brands to Premier Foods, who 
now produce the Brand at their Knighton site in Staffordshire.

A food and drink survey carried out in 2000 found 99 per cent of customers recognised the brand, which accounts for 45 per cent of the custard consumed in the UK.

Bird's Custard is also exported to several countries around the world, including the United States, where it is popular among several ethnic groups.

In 2012 Bird’s sold 108million pints of custard (as consumed), which equates to 21 Olympic sized swimming pools.

The original Custard factory in Digbeth is now a centre providing space to artists.
