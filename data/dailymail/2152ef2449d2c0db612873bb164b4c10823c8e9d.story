England legend Paul Gascoigne looked relaxed and healthy just a month after he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. 

Former England star Gascoigne was seen out for one of the first times since  he was sectioned following an apparent alcohol binge in October.

The 47-year-old, who according to friends has been boosted by a fresh diet and exercise regime and the support of his new girlfriend Mandy Thomas, 44, was spotted out shopping, and smiled at cameras.

The England star has always had his troubles with drink, as he highlighted with his controversial celebration

The ex-Newcastle, Spurs and Rangers midfielder bought groceries including milk and air freshener, alongside a copy of The Sun and Hello! magazine.

He visited an off-licence, but only to buy cigarettes.

The former superstar has struggled with alcohol addiction for several years since retiring from the game in 2004.

He made 57 appearances for England, but later entered rehab seven times and was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel.

The star was placed on a three-day emergency detox after being rushed to hospital in the early hours of October 24 following an apparent alcohol binge.

On Sunday the  Newcastle United legend made a 700-mile trip to his home city to encourage budding players

But he has now been recovering at his seaside apartment with his girlfriend Ms Thomas, who he started dating only recently.

He is making daily trips to the gym, concentrating on his diet and abstaining from alcohol, friends told the Sunday People. 

The trip to the shops was earlier this week - and on Sunday the Gateshead-born Newcastle United legend made a trip to his home city to encourage budding footballers.

He grinned as he posed with young players from Wallsend Boys FC, with the reaction on Twitter proving his enduring popularity.

'The lads with Gazza after the game today,' said one supporter. 'Absolute legend'.
