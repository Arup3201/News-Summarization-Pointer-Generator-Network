Devastating mistake: The blood used in the transfusion was HIV positive, the hospital said

Saudi Arabia has erupted in outrage over the case of a 12-year-old girl who was reportedly given a transfusion of HIV-positive blood.

Reham al-Hakami received the transfusion on February 12 at the main hospital in her village of Jazan. But hours later medical staff visited her home to tell her family that the blood was HIV-positive.

The potentially lethal mistake has prompted an unprecedented reaction in the ultraconservative Islamic kingdom with angry calls for the health minister  Abdullah al-Rabiah to resign.

Subjects such as HIV and AIDS remain strictly taboo in Saudi Arabia where open criticism of government officials is extremely rare.

Reham, who suffers from sickle cell anemia, was airlifted to the King 
Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. It is unclear 
whether she has tested positive for HIV, CNN reported.

The Health Ministry says it is investigating the matter.

On Twitter, it said it was 'acting on behalf of the family as the legal guardian in seeking compensation and to ensure that the legal procedures and the decisions made by the legal health councils will be carried out in her case.'

The case has prompted a furious backlash across Saudi Arabia, with angry calls for the health minister Abdullah al-Rabiah to resign, CNN reported.

Seven ministry officials were sacked and some were fined, including the coordinator of the region's AIDS program, said the statement.

Ibrahim al-Hakimi, the family's 
lawyer, said the family plans to sue the Health Ministry 'starting from 
the most senior official and including all employees involved in this 
medical mistake,' CNN reported.

By
 law, every Saudi citizen who is infected with HIV or has AIDS is 
entitled to free medical care, protection of their privacy as to how 
they got infected and employment opportunities.

But there is still a strong stigma surrounding those living with the disease.

While
 the government has designated several hospitals to treat those infected
 with AIDS or HIV, some hospitals often refuse to care for patients.

Because
 of strong taboos and the stigma attached to how the virus can be 
spread, hospitals and schools are often reluctant to distribute 
government information abotu the disease.

In
 2008 a new law was enacted, demanding all Saudi couples seeking to 
marry to get tested for AIDS-HIV. Previously the rule only applied to 
foreigners wishing to marry there.
