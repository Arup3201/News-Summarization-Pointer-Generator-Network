A mother suffered an extreme and terrifying form of postnatal depression which caused her to hear voices and fantasise about killing her baby daughter.

Having never suffered any form of mental illness, Lyndsey Walker, 20, experienced rare postpartum psychosis following the birth of her daughter Elizabeth, now 15 months old.

The psychosis manifested itself as a male voice inside Miss Walker's head which told her she was an unfit mother and that her family would be better off if she were dead.

Recovered: Lyndsey Walker, 20, with fiance Andrew, experienced rare postpartum psychosis following the birth of her daughter Elizabeth, now 15 months old

Troubled: The psychosis manifested itself as a male voice inside Miss Walker's head which told her she was an unfit mother and her family would be better off if she were dead

The voice even encouraged her to imagine asphyxiating Elizabeth, resulting in Miss Walker attempting suicide.

While postnatal depression is relatively common, affecting around one in ten women, postpartum psychosis is 100 times rarer.

Miss Walker, a former hairdresser, said: 'After Elizabeth was born I didn't feel anything towards her, good or bad. I had no emotions at all.

'I pretended I was delighted in order not to make other people alarmed. But I was steadily getting worse, and soon resented having to change and feed Elizabeth.

'A deep male voice started talking to me, coming to me at times I couldn't predict. He told me I was so bad at being a mum that Elizabeth would be better off if I were dead.

'I had visions of smothering Elizabeth with a pillow, which I believed would make the voice leave me alone, although I never came close to hurting her.'

Arrival: Baby Elizabeth was born in December 2012 after an exhausting 39 hour labour

Miss Walker said: 'I loved having the bump. I felt really close to my daughter from an early stage. The labour really took it out of me. But when they gave me Elizabeth to hold, I didn't feel anything

Elizabeth, Miss Walker's daughter with her fiance Andrew Jackson, 29, a car detailer, was born in December 2012 after an exhausting 39-hour labour.

Miss Walker, of Preston, said: 'Andrew and I found out I was pregnant almost as soon as we decided to start trying. We were really happy.

Postpartum psychosis affects about 1 in every 1,000 women (0.1 per cent) who have a baby. It is much less common than Baby Blues or postnatal depression.

It is a severe episode of mental illness which begins suddenly in the days or weeks after having a baby.

Symptoms vary and can change rapidly. They can include high mood (mania), depression, confusion, hallucinations and delusions.

Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency and help must be sought as quickly as possible.

Postpartum psychosis can happen to any woman.

It often occurs ‘out of the blue’ to women who have not been ill before.

Women usually recover fully after an episode of postpartum psychosis.

'I'm close to my mum and loved the idea of passing on that love and having a little life to care for.

'I loved having the bump. I felt really close to my daughter from an early stage. The labour really took it out of me.

Then, when they gave me Elizabeth to hold, I didn't feel anything. I wasn't sad, or surprised. I didn't feel any strong feelings whatsoever. I thought, 'I'm holding a baby, and it's OK, but I'm not that bothered'.

'Over time, things became unbearable. Washing, dressing and feeding Elizabeth was just a chore. Andy and my mum Amanda could tell I was suffering so they asked me to go and see a doctor.'

At the GP's office, Miss Walker was scared to reveal a troubling development - that she had begun hearing a voice in her head.

She said: 'I wasn't sleeping very much and was very shaky. I was terrified that if the doctor heard about the voice then Elizabeth would be taken away from me.

'The voice told me that Elizabeth was sent by the devil. Then, when I began fantasise about hurting her, I knew it was time to seek help.

Problems: As time went on, Miss Walker struggled to  wash, dress and feed Elizabeth, because it felt like 'a chore'

'I told mum everything and she took me back to the doctor, who diagnosed postpartum psychosis and prescribed anti-depressants and anti-psychotic medicine. But by then I was doing everything to voice told me to do.

'It tried to make a bargain - it said it would leave me alone if I swallowed all my medication at the same time while drinking an entire bottle of wine.'

Recovering from her overdose, Miss Walker volunteered to be placed on a psychiatric ward, where she would stay under close supervision for two weeks.

She said: 'It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It was strange having to line up for medication every morning with the other patients, and being away from everyone.

'Although I was allowed visitors, I wasn't permitted to see Elizabeth for a week.

Battle: Miss Walker began to hear a voice in her head that said Elizabeth was sent by the devil. When she began fantasise about hurting her, she knew she had to seek help

Apart: Miss Walker was banned from seeing Elizabeth for a week - during which time she began to long for her

'Being away from her had an effect I didn't expect - I started longing to be with her. It was the first sign of a change within me.

'When I came out of hospital I started to notice things about Elizabeth - how beautiful her smile was, and what fun we had when we're together.

Miss Walker hopes to raise awareness of postpartum psychosis to help others affected

'I knew I loved her and would do anything for her.'

Today Miss Walker says Elizabeth is the light of her life. She has been given a clean bill of health by psychiatrists and doctors and, following several months of aftercare at home, she will be completely discharged from the mental healthcare services next week.

She now hopes to raise awareness of postpartum psychosis in order to give hope to parents affected by it.

Postpartum psychosis, or PPP, affects approximately one in 1,000 mothers. Most women who experience it have no history of mental illness themselves, or within their families.

She said: 'I've had to accept that the experience has changed my life.

'Women who have suffered postpartum psychosis after their first pregnancy have an even chance of developing it again after following pregnancies, so there are risk factors to consider if I want to have more children in the future.

'What I went through was terrible and even though it's rare it can happen to anyone.

'But when people ask me about it, I don't shy away from it. It's important that all aspects of mental health are discussed openly and honestly in order for people to understand it better.'
