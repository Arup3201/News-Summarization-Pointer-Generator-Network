Drug addict tenants are leaving squalid bedsits filled with piles of rubbish, discarded food, ripped up carpets and broken doors.

Filthy kitchens crammed with dozens of packets and rotting food left behind by tenants have been discovered in bedsits in South Somerset where floors are strewn with discarded clothes and alcohol bottles, walls are damp and covered in mould, and doors left hanging off their hinges.

Housing inspectors are trying to get private landlords who own more than 400 bedsits across the county to clear up the properties which have turned to squalor, frequently after use by drug addict former tenants, so they are safe for the 1,000 people living in them.

Bedsits across south Somerset have been found littered with rubbish, with damp walls and broken doors and handrails - putting many of the 1,000 vulnerable and elderly people living in them in the county at risk 

They said some of the problems are often caused by one tenant who may make the mess, but landlords are not then stepping in to deal with the problem and clear up properly or fix broken items and damp rooms - making them unsafe for people who need to live there. 

Inspectors visited a number of bedsits across the county and found damp, mould, disrepair, trip hazards and dangerous electrics as well as inadequate handrails and rubbish on the floor.

Piles of rubbish were found in bedsits inspectors and the council wants landlords to take more responsibility

Kitchens were found in filthy states of disrepair - with food and takeaway packets spilling out of cupboards 

Other bedsits were found to be filled with litter, including old food waste, wrappers, newspapers, bottles and old clothes.

The bedsits have become filthy as demand for properties in  in the area has increased in recent months because of rising rental costs. 

In some cases inspectors said private landlords were not clearing up properly so that bedsits were unsafe when vulnerable people moved in, and they called on private landlords to step up to deal with the issues.  

Private landlords have been accused of neglecting their duties, by not making repairs where they are needed 

Inspectors who visited bedsits in South Somerset said a number of vulnerable people are forced to live there

Councillor Peter Seib, the district council's portfolio holder for environmental health, said: 'With increasing housing pressure it is important for us to work with private landlords to ensure everyone is provided with a good standard of accommodation.

'Likewise we need to ensure that private homeowners get the help they need to ensure their homes are kept in good repair.

'The housing standards team is here to help where help is required and to enforce relevant legislation as necessary to ensure that standards are maintained.'
