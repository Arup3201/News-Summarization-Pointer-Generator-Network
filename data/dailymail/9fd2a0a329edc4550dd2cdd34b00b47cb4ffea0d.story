AS the name would suggest, it really can hurt a fly.

But quite how that makes a fly-swat an offensive weapon – and one which a 33-year-old mother needed ID to buy – is a mystery.

Nicola Butcher visited her local hardware shop to buy the flimsy utensil when her kitchen became plagued with flies.

'Offensive weapon': Nicola Butcher was eventually allowed to purchase the flimsy fly swat, deemed an 'offensive weapon' at her local store, once she showed them ID

But she was stunned when the assistant refused to sell it to her unless she produced her driving licence or passport.

The till - at Home Hardware, in Romsey, Hampshire - flashed up a warning sign, which indicated the fly swat was classified as an 'offensive weapon'.

It means bosses considered the swat as dangerous as knives, fireworks, and lighters, which can only be sold legally to over 18s.

Mrs Butcher - mum to two-year-old daughter India - said: 'The fly swat is a flimsy piece of plastic - certainly not an offensive weapon.

'I’d like to say it wouldn’t hurt a fly but that’s probably the only thing it could come close to hurting.

'I could swat somebody with it using all my strength and I doubt it would leave even the slightest of marks or bruises.'

Mrs Butcher, who was recently made redundant from her project manager job at insurance firm Aviva, took the request for ID as a compliment.

Only once the 33-year-old produced her passport did the shop attendant at the hardware store in Romsey, Hants (pictured), let her buy the swat

She said: 'The number of flies has 
rocketed in the hot weather and unfortunately some of them have made 
their way from my garden into my kitchen.

'I broke my old fly swat from overuse and went to the local shop to buy a replacement.

'I only expected to be in the store for a couple of minutes but it turned into a bit of a drama at the checkout.

'The
shop assistant - who was in her fifties - told me a warning had flashed
up telling her the swat was an "offensive weapon" and she should check 
the customer is over 18.

'I thought she was having a laugh but she invited me round the other side of the till to show me the screen.

This is not the first time shops have asked people for ID when buying apparently innocent items.

Parents
Kirsty Breeze, 19, and Ian Jackson, 24, had to prove their age when 
buying a Fireman Sam DVD from Sainsbury’s in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs.

Office
worker Christine Cuddihy, 24, was told she had to be aged over 21 to 
buy a cheese and onion quiche from Tesco in Coventry, West Midlands.

And writer Elinor Zuke, 25, was asked for ID when buying a £1.19 pack of six teaspoons at Sainsbury, in Crawley, West Sussex.

Anybody convicted of selling a knife to a person aged under 18 can be jailed for up to six months or fined up to £5,000.

An offensive weapon is any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person, including knives and hidden knives.

'We were both laughing and joking but she asked if I had my driving licence or passport on me, which I thought was ridiculous.

'I’m
33 years old and think I look my age but I did take her request as a 
compliment. In the end I had to get my driving licence out.

'How can an innocent plastic fly swat be an offensive weapon? What is the world coming to when you can’t buy a fly swat without producing ID for it.

'I can understand why you would ask for ID when you were buying fireworks, alcohol, or a high voltage electric fly swat - but not a cheap plastic one.

'The shop also sells spades and frying pans which would cause much more damage if I smacked somebody over the head with one of them.'

Lindsey Waude, the store’s assistant manager, said: 'We think it might be an error on our till system.

'Sometimes it flashes up that something is an offensive weapon, but our guy who does the computers has been on his honeymoon for three weeks

'I’m sure the member of staff asked for it in jest.'
