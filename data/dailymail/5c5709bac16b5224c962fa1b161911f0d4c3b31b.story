A voicemail message in which John Edwards's mistress makes fun of her lover's cancer-stricken wife has been released as the former Democratic politician stands trial accused of using campaign money to hide his affair in 2008.

Rielle Hunter, who was pregnant with Edwards's child as he vied to become Barack Obama's running mate, left the message for his aide Andrew Young as she watched the then Senator on television.

She can be heard laughing down the phone as she points out the awkward body language between Edwards and his wife - who had terminal cancer.

'The have footage of it on ABC News 
World News Tonight, Obama leaving the house shaking his hand, um, and 
Elizabeth, and, and, Johnny and Elizabeth couldn't be further apart from
each other (laughter),' she says.

'They're so far apart': Rielle Hunter left a voicemail for Edwards aide Andrew Young laughing at this news video which shows John Edwards (right) and his wife Elizabeth (left) standing apart from one another

Running mates? The clip showed then-candidate Barack Obama leaving a private meeting at the home of John Edwards, seen shaking hands here

Close: Mr Obama and Edwards hugged goodbye as many speculated that Edwards wanted to be his vice president

'I mean, on either side, like of the driveway. So, so, yea, interesting,' she continued.

The video that Hunter was referring to, shown above, was captured from a helicopter who spotted Mr Obama, who was the front-runner in the Democratic race, making a private visit to the Edwards' North Carolina home after a meeting with the Senator.

In the short clip, it shows Mr Obama leaving their house, shaking Edwards' hand and giving him a hug before riding off in his black SUV.

Once Mr Obama leaves, Edwards and Elizabeth walk back into the home standing several feet apart from one another.

The voicemail messages come on day four of the Democrat's corruption trial and was one of about 13 between Edwards, Young, and Hunter that the prosecution put into the record of evidence.

A number of the other voicemails consist of Edwards calling Young and 'checking in'. At the time, Young and his family were travelling with the pregnant Hunter, after Young initially claimed the paternity in order to keep the heat off of Edwards.

In several of the messages, Edwards makes mention of his wife being in his presence, effectively stifling what he really wants to say.

The prosecution also put pictures of the expensive hotels where the Youngs and Hunter stayed during this trip, allegedly on the campaign's dime.

John Edwards' defense lawyer on Thursday picked apart ex-aide Andrew Young's story that he was asked to conceal Edwards' affair with a mistress with campaign money, accusing him of making up stories about the former presidential contender to make money off of the scandal.

Letter from donor: This handwritten note from 'Bunny' Mellon shows her lamenting over the fact that the press skewered Edwards' $400 haircuts, and she said that she would take care of bills

Payments: Ms Mellon would write that her donations were for expensive furniture, like the Table this $10,000 check was for, rather than the alleged payments to hide Hunter

Andrew Young took the witness stand for a fourth straight day at Edwards' campaign finance fraud trial.

The star prosecution witness is key to the government's case that while campaigning for the White House in 2008, Edwards directed a scheme to use nearly $1million in secret payments from two wealthy donors to conceal an affair with his pregnant mistress.

Edwards has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts and faces up to 30 years behind bars if convicted.

The defence argued in opening statements that Young spent most of the money at issue in the case to build a $1.5million house for his family, not to buy the silence of Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter.

The defence sought to undermine Young's credibility and paint him as a pathological liar.

Defence
lawyer Abbe Lowell pointed out inconsistencies with Young's account of 
the scandal at trial this week and in multiple other accounts, including
grand jury testimony and his 2010 tell-all book about Edwards.

Repeatedly,
Lowell accused Young of lying. Referring to the timing of a 
conversation with a law partner of Edwards, Lowell asked, ‘And you made 
that up too, didn't you?’

December 14, 2007John Edwards to Andrew Young'Uh, if that's, if I'm calling saying what happened, how did this happen, what's goin' on, then that's because Elizabeth's standing there with me. 'Cause I have to, I think I've gotta tell her about this because it's moving.'

December 27John Edwards to Andrew Young'I'm just checkin' in with you and, and makin' sure you're safe and, and in a place where you're good and you can just call me back

January 8, 2008John Edwards to Andrew Young'Uh, just wanted for all of you, including her, to know that I am thinking about you.'

January 10, 2008Fred Baron to Andrew Young'(Edwards) wants you to know that he's not taking your call or her call right now because of, uh, his circumstances with, uh, the EE, and not to take it personally, but it'll get better soon. But right now he's in a bad place. So, don't get your feelings hurt if your calls are not being returned or her calls are not being returned.'

February 17, 2008 Rielle Hunter to Andrew Young 'They have footage of it on ABC News World News tonight, Obama leaving the house shaking his hand, um, and Elizabeth, and, and, Johnny and Elizabeth couldn't be further apart from each other (laughter). I mean, on either side, like of the driveway. So, so, yea, interesting.'

‘No, sir,’ Young responded.

Lowell asked Young whether he first learned Hunter, was pregnant in May 2007, as his book says: in June 2007, as he testified; or in early July, a date backed by phone records and Hunter's medical records.

The timeline issues could challenge the accounts of conversations Young said he had with Edwards in a car discussing who to ask for money to help take care of Hunter and discussing Hunter's pregnancy.

Young said he couldn't recall the exact date for either event.

Lowell also challenged Young on which amount of secret money a wealthy heiress said she would provide to help make Edwards president - $1.2million, as he testified this week, or $900,000 and $925,000, figures he had previously given.

Young said the number he provided this week is the correct one.

Young
had falsely claimed paternity of Edwards' daughter, Frances Quinn 
Hunter, while Edwards was campaigning for president. Edwards 
acknowledged he had fathered the child two years later.

As
Lowell's detailed questioning continued, some jurors appeared 
distracted and even U.S. District Court Judge Catherine C. Eagles grew 
impatient.

‘I'm not quite 
following,’ the judge told Lowell after he asked Young a question about 
whose idea it was for Young to claim paternity of Hunter's child. ‘We're
about to beat a dead horse here.’

She warned the attorney she might cut off his questions if they weren't relevant to the criminal charges facing Edwards.

‘You're going to get to the money, right?’ she asked Lowell.

Young was expected to remain on the stand throughout all of Thursday. His wife, Cheri Young, could take the stand on Friday.
