Forced to fight other dogs in Afghanistan, and beaten and mutilated by uncaring humans, Wylie the dog was on the brink of death.

But since being rescued by British soldiers from the former Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, the plucky mongrel has become a star performer.

After being whisked to safety in England, Wylie has now won an award run by the Kennel Club - and could be set for even more glory.

The four-year-old dog yesterday triumphed in the Best Crossbreed Rescued dog class event staged in the Scruffts competition at London’s Earls Court.

Scruffts is the crossbreed competition run alongside Crufts, which is for pedigree dogs - and Wylie will now next March be one of the six finalists for the title of overall Scruffts champion. Some 1,200 dogs were entered at the start of the competition.

When he was found, Wylie had suffered as his ears and tail were cut off, and had been brutally beaten.

Happy: He now lives with owner Sarah Singleton in Yeovil. They travelled together to London for the contest

Saved: He was discovered by Nowzad Dogs charity in 2011. They have saved a further 550 Afghan dogs

But a charity named Nowzad Dogs and run by former Marine Commando Pen Farthing leapt in to save him, along with another 550 Afghan dogs it has now rescued and sent to happy new lives in the developed world.

Wylie was first spotted at a bazaar in Kandahar in February 2011, where British troops came across a crowd watching a dog fight. Poor Wylie was being beaten with sticks to encourage him to rejoin the fray.

Happy: Wylie's new life in Somerset includes regular walks, lots of cuddles and a caring new owner

On a roll: He has already won a few regional rounds and had a starring role in this year's Crufts competition

Celebration: Members of the charity that found Wylie celebrate as Miss Singleton presents his award

After he was patched up he was set free - but returned with new injuries. The pattern repeated itself until he was handed to Nowzad, who sent him back to Britain, to kennels in the West Country.

He was eventually given a home by Sarah Singleton, 35, a groom and retail worker from Yeovil Somerset, who described her relationship with him as a ‘love affair with a lovely dog’.

Miss Singleton said: ‘Wylie is a stray feral dog from Afghanistan and despite all the abuse and human inflicted trauma, he has a wonderful temperament and is incredibly friendly with people.

‘He now lives happily with me and my other two dogs. Despite everything he’s been through he is a gentle, trusting dog who loves everyone.’
