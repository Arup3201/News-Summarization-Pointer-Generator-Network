A big-game hunter from
 Montana is suing a Canadian outfitter and a world-renowned hunting 
guide in Tajikistan he accuses of turning his once-in-a-lifetime 
adventure of bagging a rare, wild argali sheep known as the 'Marco Polo'
 into a nightmare.

Rick Vukasin said in a 
lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Reno last week that he spent 
more than $50,000 pursuing the animal in the Pamir mountains of 
northeast Tajikistan near China's border in December 2012.

The
 65-year-old electrician said he felt like he was literally on top of 
the world after he tracked, shot and killed a 400-pound, big-horned ram 
with the coveted, spiraling horns at an elevation of 14,000 feet. But he
 was mortified two months later when he opened up the box shipped to his
 home in Great Falls to find the horns were not the 58-inch-long ones 
from his trophy animal.

'Marco Polo': Rick Vukasin claims the horns he was sent are not the horns that were on the animal he shot

'I could tell right away,' Vukasin said. 'I was sick.'

The
 native Montanan who grew up hunting deer on the eastern front of the 
Northern Rockies had stalked moose in Saskatchewan and red stag elk in 
New Zealand.

'But the thing I really wanted to
 do was a Marco Polo sheep hunt,' he said. He poured over books, guides 
and websites before settling on the excursion halfway around the world.

'The
 biggest of the species is in Tajikistan. So I figured if I was only 
going to be able to do this once, I'm going top shelf,' he said.

Vukasin
 and his guide, Yuri Matison, saw animals the first day but had 
difficulty tracking them partly because it's hard to breathe at that 
altitude, he said. But the next day he said he 'felt lucky' to land a 
prize with a rack in 'pretty good shape ... not all busted up from 
fighting.'

The horns he ended up with are 
missing a few noticeable chips and weathered to the point he suspects 
they are at least two years old.

Vukasin said 
Matison and the booking outfitter - Ameri-Cana Expeditions Inc. of 
Edmonton, Alberta - first insisted the horns were the originals, then 
offered to send a replacement.

Rare: The wild argali sheep can be found in the Pamir Mountains and is one of the rarest sheep in the world

He's demanding 
reimbursement or his original horns, but he said a possible exchange is 
complicated by international treaties governing hunting of argali, a 
threatened species in Tajikistan. Only 60 permits are issued there 
annually for the sheep named after the 13th century explorer.

The
 Safari Club International considers the argali's horns the 'most 
spectacular' of all the world's sheep, according to its record book. 
Vukasin shot his in the same region where Matison had served as guide 
about a month before for Soudy Golbachi of Augusta, Ga., when he set a 
club record for landing one with horns more than 71 inches long.

Vukasin said Ameri-Cana co-owner Dan Frederick dismissed his concerns, telling him 'it's just hunting.'

'Granted,' Vukasin said, 'you can have bad weather or you might not see any animals or you might miss the shot. That's hunting.

'But to shoot the animal and take pictures of it and then not to get it, somebody has to be responsible.'

Frederick didn't immediately return calls or email seeking comment. The Associated Press was unable to locate Matison.

Tajikistan: Vukasin traveled all the way to the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan for a chance to hunt the rare sheep

Vukasin
 said he contacted an FBI agent in Great Falls, who indicated he 
probably was a fraud victim but there was little authorities could do 
unless they found a number of other hunters who'd also been duped.

FBI spokesman William Facer in Salt Lake City said on Friday the agency could not comment.

Linda
 Linton, a Reno lawyer, said she filed Vukasin's lawsuit there because 
Matison and Ameri-Cana advertise and do business there regularly at 
conventions of the Safari Club International and the Wild Sheep 
Foundation, the latter of which named Matison to its Mountain Hunter 
Hall of Fame in 2009.

Vukasin is seeking $75,000 in damages for lost money, 'worry, anxiety, loss of sleep, physical and mental distress.'

'I've
 been fighting them more than a year. I finally got fed up and decided 
to do something about it,' he said, adding he's convinced others have 
been victimized. 'I have this stuff sitting in my living room and every 
time I look at the horns, I just get that much more mad.'
