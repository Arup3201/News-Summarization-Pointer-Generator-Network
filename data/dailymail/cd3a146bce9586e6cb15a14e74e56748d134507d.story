Three female tourists were hit in the face and head with a hammer in a brutal attack at one of London’s biggest and busiest hotels just yards from busy Oxford Street.

One of the women is in a critical but stable condition after the assault in a room at the Four Star Cumberland Hotel in the early hours of yesterday morning.

The women, understood to be sisters from the United Arab Emirates, were staying at the hotel with children as young as seven-years-old in adjoining rooms when they were attacked.

Officers today said the thief gained access to their rooms after one of the women left her door unlocked.

He then attacked the first women before going into the adjoining room through a connecting door where he beat the other two women shortly before 2am on Sunday morning.

One of the women is in critical condition but the other two have non-life threatening injuries.

Detective Supterintendent Carl Mehta said that they are looking for a white male who maybe have been 'covered in blood' when he fled the hotel during the early hours of Sunday morning.

He revealed that police are now examining CCTV from Oxford St in a bid to reconstruct the family's movements and to see if they were followed.

Det Supt Mehta said that the room, on the seventh floor of the hotel, was deliberately left unlocked by the occupants as they had other family members staying at the hotel.

Three women and three children shared the two rooms which had an adjoining door.

Mr Mehta said: 'It was a vicious attack. We will be putting together the moments preceding the attack in the hotel to establish what happened.

'We are keeping an open mind at this early stage but theft does appear to be the motive.

'We are relatively comfortable there was no breach of hotel security and the door had been left unlocked.

'There is no evidence of the key being stolen and the family had deliberately left the door open.

'He went into the woman's room and attacked the woman. The children were not disturbed or harmed. The man left behind the hammer.'

Police are putting together CCTV images in an attempt to work out what happened before the attack.

'I don't know if he followed them but they had been shopping on Saturday in major retail places like Oxford Street. They are clearly a wealthy family.

'It's an unusual attack in London and it's unprecedented.'

Manhunt: Police are appealing for any witnesses of the incident on Sunday morning at the Cumberland Hotel, pictured, to come forward

The family arrived in London separately between the 3rd and 5th of this month. The children are aged between seven and 12-years-old.

Det Supt Mehta added: 'The children remain unharmed and are being looked after by other family members.

'There are other members of family in the UK and family liaison officers are with them giving them support and information as it arrived.

'We are conducting a detailed forensic investigation looking at the scene and the CCTV images from the hotel and surrounding area.

'I am making a desperate appeal for witnesses who saw a single white male leaving the hotel possibly covered in blood.

'It's a large London hotel and lots of people were around that time of the morning. It's extraordinarily rare and there's no indication that this type of incident had taken place previously.'

Hotel guests have described horrifying scenes following the attack with one man revealing how he saw a woman in blood stained pyjamas screaming 'he attacked me, he attacked me' running down the corridor.

Faleh Al Rashidi, a media executive from Kuwait who is staying at The Cumberland hotel on his honeymoon, said the woman screamed before collapsing in the corridor outside his room.

The 28-year-old said the woman was dressed in black pyjama bottoms and a light blue dress spattered with blood.

Mr Al Rashidi said: 'I think she had run down from the seventh floor. We were staying on the first floor.

'She was screaming so loudly "he 
attacked me, he attacked me, help me, help me" then she fell in the 
floor and a man came to help her.

'She
 was wearing black pyjama bottoms and a light blue dress on top which 
had blood on it. She was shaking uncontrollably. I think she was about 
25-years-old.

'I'm not sure she was attacked, I think she was a witness. I don't feel safe here after seeing that.'

Another guest, Hasan Mohamed who is also from the UAE, was woken up by the screaming at about 1.45am.

The 28-year-old businessman said: 'She was screaming that she regretted coming to London, she was shouting about what had happened to her sisters. She said two of her sisters' heads were bleeding.

'I was very afraid - we didn't see her we just heard her screaming. It was very loud and woke us both up.'

The women, who are in their thirties, had travelled to London for a shopping spree from their home in the United Arab Emirates

Scotland Yard has launched a nationwide manhunt to trace the attacker, who was not a guest at the hotel.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Andy Chalmers said: 'This was an unusually violent 
attack on three women and I am very keen to speak with anyone who was in
 or around the hotel between 1am and 2am on Sunday morning.

'Did you see or hear anything that could be of use to my officers? If so, we would like to hear from you as soon as possible.'

At
 this stage, police are retaining an open mind regarding the motive for 
the attack. One line of inquiry is that the assault came after a bungled
 robbery by an opportunist thief.

Detectives
 have retrieved CCTV footage and are questioning staff and other guests.
 A spokesman for the hotel said everything has returned to normal at the
 Cumberland following the incident.

He said: ‘It’s an ongoing investigation 
and we are helping police with their inquiries in order to get this 
sorted as soon as possible.’

There have been no arrests following the incident.

A spokeswoman for London Ambulance Service said: 'We were called to reports of an assault at Great Cumberland Place.

'We sent a responder in a car and three ambulance crews. Staff treated three patients, all women, and two were reported to be in their 30s.

'All patients were taken as priorities to hospital.'

The area surrounding the hotel, near Marble Arch, is popular with tourists from the Middle East.

Prices for a night at the 1,000-room Cumberland Hotel, which also has a Jimi Hendrix suite as the musician gave his last ever interview there in 1970, range from £142 for a single room to £316 for the junior king suite with breakfast and dinner included.

The hotel’s website boasts of its ‘cutting edge contemporary design’ in the heart of London ‘where Oxford Street meets Park Lane’.

It adds: ‘The spectacular, spacious lobby creates a striking first impression with contemporary, original art and lighting.

'Every feature is beautifully considered at this iconic Hyde Park hotel, from the unique Jimi Hendrix Suite to London’s finest restaurants and bars.’

Mike DeNoma, CEO of the Guoman Hotels group, said: 'We are very concerned for their family and our employees. We are doing everything we can to assist the police with their enquiries.

'We just don't know at this stage how it happened.'
