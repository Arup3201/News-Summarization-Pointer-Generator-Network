Move over Lionel Messi and Tim Cahill. James Rodriguez scored the goal of the World Cup so far in the first half of Colombia’s last 16 clash with Uruguay at the Maracana.

Controlling a header on his chest 25 yards from goal, Colombia’s No 10 let the ball drop and then – with two Uruguay players closing in – unleashed an unstoppable left-foot volley that crashed against the crossbar before bouncing down and into the net.

The goal was Rodriguez’s fourth of 
the tournament and he scored another shortly after the break from yards 
out to double Colombia's lead and put him clear at the top of the 
goalscoring charts for the tournament. 

'You always try to score goals like 
that in training, and I have to say it was nice to get one,' he told 
FIFA.com.

Before the tournament the odds on the 
Colombian star to be top goalscorer at the World Cup were 100/1 after he
 had an up-and-down season with Monaco.

Even before the match against Uruguay, Rodriguez had a decent claim to being the tournament’s best player so far.

His
 evasive runs and sharp shooting caused havoc against all of Colombia’s 
group stage opponents and he continued in a similar vein against 
Uruguay.

Rodriguez continued: 'It’s
 not easy to achieve what I’ve done, but my view is that when you have a
 dream and you really pursue it and picture things like this happening, 
then it can become a reality.

'If you 
want something and you work hard for it, then it can happen. The
 boss has helped me improve in everything. He talks to me a
 lot and it’s thanks to him that my tactical appreciation of the game 
has improved along with my mental strength.'

Colombia manager Jose Pekerman added:
 'In my long experience in football, I've had in my teams extraordinary 
footballers, elite players of a very high technical level.

'I
 place everything in James because I saw the extraordinary conditions 
that he had. What is most surprising is that at his young age he does 
not have any objection, any problem in being responsible for doing 
things that football players take many years to understand.

'Football
 forces you to deal with a lot of situations, you have to handle these 
situations and we have a technical player who has every attribute of a 
top-notch player at a world level.

'I
 greatly praise what he has been doing and I never had any doubts that 
this was going to be his World Cup. James Rodriguez's World Cup.'
