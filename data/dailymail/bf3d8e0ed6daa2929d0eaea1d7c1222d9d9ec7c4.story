Killer: Mathew Hodgkinson, 36, allegedly shot dead his lover before trying to take his own life

The British host of a U.S. TV show who left England after he was accused of sexually abusing boys at a dance school he owned has been shot dead by his son-in-law lover.

Scott 
Rogers, 52, was allegedly killed by 36-year-old Mathew Hodgkinson, who is also British, in a murder-suicide attempt at their Baton Rouge, Louisiana 
home last Wednesday, according to local police.

Hodgkinson survived the suicide attempt and is in a coma. He was a former student of Rogers' in the U.K. and his lover, and he had married Rogers' daughter Kimmy in order to be able to stay in the U.S., WBRZ reported.

Rogers, who was well-known locally as the host of the feel-good weekend show 'Around Town', was found dead under covers in bed.

Beside him was a suicide note apparently written by Hodgkinson, reading: 'They broke our happy loving home. 
They do not get to take Scott too.'

The note was an apparent reference to troubles they had been experiencing with authorities in regards to Rogers' children earlier this month.

He was under investigation for fraud and the state had taken custody of his 
two kids - a 10-year-old adopted son and a two-year-old boy he was
 in the process of adopting - The Advocate reported.

His show had also been canceled on Monday, WBRZ reported.

 TV personality Scott Rogers, 52, was shot and killed at his Baton Rouge
 home on Wednesday by Hodgkinson, a British man who had married his daughter to be able to stay in the country

'Suicide note': The
 Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office said this suspected suicide note was found in the home. It apparently references the recent struggles the couple had had with authorities over Rogers' children

Scott Rogers, who was known as Richard Scott-Rogers in the UK, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds in 1983. 

But the school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council in 1995, and they warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending their children there.

According to the Bury Free Press, Rogers was acquitted of child molestation charges involving a 13-year-old boy in 1993.

Parents also told the paper about 'sleepovers' Rogers would have with some of his young students, during which he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags.'

In 1995, Suffolk County Council voiced concerns about 'a senior member' of the academy following a High Court case in 1993.

In a statement released at the time, the council warned parents of an 'unhealthy atmosphere' at the academy and compared it to that of 'a religious or supposedly religious cult' .

It said: 'There was also considerable anxiety felt as to levels of intimacy that existed between the senior member and pupils.'

But at the time head teacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cult-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts.' 

Rogers left the UK and moved to the U.S. in the mid-90s. 

Iberville 
Parish Sheriff Brett Stassi told the Times-Picayune
 that the marriage between Hodgkinson and Rogers' daughter was a sham to
 keep him in the country. She was reportedly testifying before a federal
 grand jury when her father was killed.

As a result, Stassi said Rogers' 
home had been the scene of a 'bunch of stress' in the past several 
weeks.

'It
 looked like a murder and failed attempted suicide,' Stassi said. 'It's 
been topsy-turvy at this residence... We responded to a couple of calls.
 It's been a high stress environment for this family and looks like it 
culminated in this.'

Rogers
 had been involved in three child molestation cases before he moved to 
the U.S. in the 90s, Stassi said. He was cleared in one, but two others 
are still pending overseas, he said.

'There
 were some other accusations that come up that were not totally resolved
 when he left England,' Stassi told WBRZ. 'I think the past history was 
catching up.'

Rogers,
then known as Richard Scott-Rogers, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, 
Suffolk in 1983.

The
 school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council 
bosses, who in 1995 warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending their
children to the school.

On Thursday 
two men, appearing anonymously on a Louisiana radio show, alleged that 
Scott Rogers had sexually 
abused them as young boys in the UK.

One
 of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at the dance academy, 
claimed to have been intimately involved with Rogers from the age of 13.
 He said that the encounters 'increased in frequency' until he was 18. 
The other alleged victim described him as a 'monster'.

Rogers, was acquitted of child molestation charges involving a 13-year-old boy in 1993, according to the Bury Free Press.

bags'.

'unhealthy atmosphere' at the academy and compared it to that of 'a 
religious or supposedly religious cult'.

It said: 'There was also considerable anxiety felt as to levels of intimacy that existed between the senior member and pupils.'

At
 the time head teacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cult-style 
brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the 
performing arts. Some of our pupils have moved on to appear in the West 
End theatre and on television.

'People
 are still coming here for classes from all over Suffolk. We are not 
involved in any cult activities and to say we are is ridiculous.'
