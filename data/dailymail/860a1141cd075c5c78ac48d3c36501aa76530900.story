They could easily win the award for the cutest pets in Britain, but these 11 micro pigs already have another accolade to their name.

While the animals themselves are miniscule, this litter of micro pigs is believed to be the biggest in Britain.

And these adorable images show the 11-strong litter in the first few weeks of their lives, complete with their wrinkled little snouts, oversized ears and tiny trotters

Owners Marc Cox and Caroline Chaplin, pictured above, were stunned when Poppy gave birth to 11 micro pigs

The micro pigs from the litter, which were born on June 7,  were all snapped up within one day of being born

Owners Marc Cox, 53, and Caroline Chaplin, 52, said they were amazed when their pig Poppy gave birth to the 11-strong litter

The couple, who run PetPiggies in Ridgmont, Bedfordshire, have been breeding pigs for the last five years and had never known a micro pig to have a litter so large.

Mr Cox said: 'It’s definitely the biggest litter we’ve ever had. On average micropigs have a litter of six, 11 is exceptional. It’s a new record for us and I’ve never heard of a bigger micro pig litter.

'We had no idea Poppy would have so many - she was big but there was nothing to indicate we’d be expecting a litter as large as this.

The couple said it is by far the largest litter they've seen and said a litter usually consists of an average of six

'Once she’d gave birth to four, I was thinking we’re nearly there but she just kept going.

'She gave birth to another and then another and another, I kept thinking: gosh how many are in there?

'But we love them all, they each have there own little personalities, some are very playful and others like their own space.'

Marc said it took less than 24 for the pets to be snapped up after they were born on June 7. 

They have just a few more weeks with their mother before they move into their new homes.

When they are fully grown, aged two, they weigh between 40 and 65 lbs and grow to about 16 inches tall

He said: 'They were all sold within a day, even though we weren’t expecting so many we always have a huge waiting list of people wanting to own one.

'We make sure we meet all the owners and they know exactly what’s involved in keeping a micro pig and are well equipped to take care of it.

'So we have no doubt every one of these pigd will be going to a loving new home.' 

Micro pigs, which can live up to 18 years, are much smaller than a standard farm pig and weigh 9oz, about the size of a tea cup when they are born.

At two years old they are fully grown and weigh between 40lbs and 65lbs and are between 12 and 16 inches tall.
