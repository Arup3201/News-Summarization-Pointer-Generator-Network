Darren Fletcher £75,000 a week move to West Ham is in jeopardy after he returned to Manchester United on Saturday after failing to agree to terms at Upton Park.

Fletcher, 30, returned to Manchester this morning as West Ham consider their options ahead of his proposed move to Upton Park.

The Manchester United midfielder's contract expires at the end of the season and he has been told by Louis van Gaal that he is free to leave Old Trafford.

After his side beat Leicester 3-1 at Old Trafford on Saturday manager Louis van Gaal was at a loss to explain why the move has broken down and expects the Scot to remain at Manchester United.

'I think so (he will remain a man utd player). He is my third captain so it is not a problem for me. Manchester United just want to help him play more. For him now that is a big pity.'

'I don't know what is happening. When you allow your player to go to London for the medical, there is no problem. At the end there is no agreement, it is strange.

'We want to help Fletcher. That is my only concern. I am very happy he is coming back. He is my third captain. Because of the competition he is not playing much.

'Because of that I want to help him. I don't know what is happening there but the agreement is different there. On Saturday it is off. I cannot say anything about it.'

Fletcher now faces an uncertain weekend after the results of his medical and West Ham now have a decision to make ahead of Monday's transfer deadline.

Fletcher is keen to make the move and was about to sign a three and a half year contract with the Hammers when he travelled to London on Friday.

Hammers midfielder Mark Noble feared he was on his way out of the club to make way for Fletcher's arrival.
