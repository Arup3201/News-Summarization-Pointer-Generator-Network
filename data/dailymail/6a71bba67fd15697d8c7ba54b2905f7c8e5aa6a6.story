Cycling for six hours on a hilly 40-mile route is difficult at the best of times.

But, when that route involves travelling along the most dangerous road in the world, it makes it all the more tricky.

These pictures show a group of cyclists from the UK during a ride along the notorious North Yungus Road in Bolivia.

The single-lane track - which is also known as Death Road - is estimated to take the lives of around 300 travellers each year.

Risky: Cyclist Nick Smith sits on the edge of the most dangerous turn as he cycles along the most dangerous road in the world

Dangerous: The single-lane route, formally known as the North Yungus Road, is a 40-mile stretch of path in Bolivia

Nerves of steel: Enveloped in a deep mist, these cyclists hang their bikes over the edge of the roadside

With no railings, the exposed and narrow road runs alongside a 700-metre sheer drop.

The trek takes around six hours to 
complete, including time for a break on the most dangerous turn on the 
road, which has claimed the most lives.

The bravest cyclists can sit on the edge of the notorious bend and dangle their legs into the valley below.

Nick Smith, 34, a graphic designer from Birmingham, travelled the length of the road during a cycling holiday.

But to make sure he stood the best chance of survival he sipped a sacred drink and prayed to 'Pacha Mama', or Mother 
Earth, in the hope that she would help him complete the journey safely.

Mr Smith, 34, said: 'We drunk some of the Pacha Mama before splashing it on our wheels and the ground as a ritual.

Lethal: It is estimated that about 300 travellers are killed each year on the road, which runs narrowly alongside a 700-metre drop

Beginning: The team of cyclists are pictured at the start of the North Yungas Road, surrounded by mist-covered mountains

Scary: These cyclists sit on the edge of the famous road, during their six hour ride

'I was scared of heights when I went but I was soon forced to confront that.

'I had tried to prepare myself for the road but after actually being there, there's nothing quite like it.

'It was terrifying to begin with but by the end of the trip I was sitting on the edge, dangling my legs above the drop!

'The views were incredible, I have never experienced anything like it.'

As
one of the few routes to connect the Amazon rainforest of northern 
Bolivia to its capital city, the road ascends to more than 15,000ft 
before drastically dropping to 3,900ft.

Hazardous: This picture shows the bleak conditions which face the cyclists on the dangerous road

Important: Cross markings on the road indicate where cars have fallen, but while the road is legendary for its extreme danger, Bolivian natives are forced to use it as a crucial transport route

Difficult: The brutal road snakes through the Bolivian mountainside . It ascends to more than 15,000ft before drastically dropping to 3,900ft

The
South-American climate creates a concoction of conditions for visitors 
to the road. The rainy season brings rain and fog to hamper visibility 
while the summer sees rockfalls and dust.

Cross markings on the road indicate 
where cars have fallen, but while the road is legendary for its extreme 
danger, Bolivian natives are forced to use it as a crucial 
transport route.

Local road rules specify that the downhill driver never has the right of way and must move to the outer edge of the road.

This forces the faster downhill vehicle to stop so that passing can be negotiated safely.

Unlike the rest of Bolivia, vehicles are required to drive on the left side of the road, to give the driver a better view of the vehicle's outside wheel and making passing safer.

No chances: Cyclist Nick Smith drinks a good luck drink which is used to see the traveller back safely

Mr Smith added:Â  'The road, in most places, is just under three metres wide so it's only really big enough for one car.

'When you see two cars trying to pass it looks impossible.'

Mr Smith took part in an organised cycling tour where experienced guides help to direct groups along the road, warning them of potential danger spots.

During the trek, they stopped for a photo opportunity on one of the most lethal corners of the road, a section that is famous for claiming most lives.

'It was refreshing to have someone who knew the road so well,' Mr Smith said.

'We stopped every so often and were told of the terrain coming up and anything we needed to be wary of.

'The start of the ride is a 21km modernised wider section which is covered in concrete tarmac, before the track turns treacherous.

'It gives you time to get used to the drops before the main part of the Death Road.'

But the group weren't without injury, as Mr Smith soon discovered.

The graphic designer said: 'One girl in the group fell off her bike and cracked her head open.

'On any other route it wouldn't have seemed such a big injury but I think as it was on the Death Road it seemed much worse.'

The track then winds around the mountain where it widens and becomes safer.

He added: 'As the road becomes safer, you begin to enjoy the surroundings which are stunning.

'Once you get you mind past how sheer the drops are, it's fascinating.

'Starting off among the clouds and then dropping down is quite magical.

'Now I have done it and survived it, I would definitely give it another shot as it was an amazing experience.'
