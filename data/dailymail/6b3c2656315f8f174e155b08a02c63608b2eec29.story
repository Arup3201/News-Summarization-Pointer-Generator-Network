This shocking CCTV footage shows a callous owner punching his dog in the head four times.

The RSPCA, who released the clip, are hunting the man after the incident in Norwich earlier this month.

The video shows the dog sitting on the pavement before his owner approaches and bends, appearing to secure a lead on his pet's collar. 

He then suddenly launches into the vicious attack, punching the dog 'with considerable force' four times - before calming crossing the road.
