Joe Launchbury has identified the key reason why he has spurned interest from Saracens and other clubs to sign his new contract with Wasps.

The 23-year-old England lock was destined to become the subject of a transfer-market stampede had he not agreed terms before the new year, which would have allowed potential suitors to pursue him.

Instead, following Wasps’ confirmation of their move to Coventry, Launchbury has signed for another three years. He pinpointed Dai Young, his director of rugby and a former Lions prop, as a major factor in that decision.

‘I am really pleased to have extended with Wasps,’ said Launchbury. ‘There were a number of factors to consider, but uppermost in my mind was where I would become the best rugby player I could be. Also, with a baby on the way, where my family would be happiest long-term. Wasps is that place.

‘I love this club, I have huge respect for the players and coaches and continuing to work with Dai Young was a huge factor. He is so knowledgeable about the game and I feel I have learnt so much from him.’

Approval for Wasps’ purchase of a 50 per cent stake in the Ricoh Arena as their new home — ending years of a nomadic existence — was another major factor. Launchbury added: ‘Since I have been at Wasps, we as a club have searched for our own home and to have finally secured that is massive. It has proved the ambition chairman Derek Richardson and the club have to re-establish ourselves as one of Europe’s most successful clubs.

‘When I saw the plans for our new training base I was blown away by the standard of facilities Wasps players will have access to on a daily basis. This is very much an environment and culture I believe in and I want to be part of it.’

Young was ecstatic, having told Sportsmail earlier this season of his belief that the club would manage to keep hold of Launchbury, their ‘crown jewel’.

‘I am over the moon that Joe has decided to stay at Wasps,’ he said. ‘It is a significant reflection of the positive direction the club is moving in that we have retained a player of his calibre and reputation within the world game. I’m not daft, I know how sought after Joe is in world rugby and imagine he will have had clubs lining up to talk to him about possibly joining them. It’s not simply Joe’s talent which marks him out as a world-class player, it is also his attitude and commitment to the team.

‘He is a very loyal and down-to-earth guy. He has weighed up all options and decided Wasps is the best place for him.’

Meanwhile, Wales centre Jonathan Davies has admitted that he needs to raise his game after a disappointing start at his new club Clermont Auvergne in France.

The 26-year-old Lion was hampered by a foot injury after his move from the Scarlets, but said: ‘That shouldn’t serve as an excuse. I must do better, I know that.’

Davies — who has been recalled for Sunday’s visit of Sale, after missing the defeat at Saracens last Saturday — revealed that his coach, Franck Azema, has been brutally honest in assessing his contribution for Clermont so far.

Davies added: ‘He’s been very clear with me. My performances have not been good enough and he’s waiting for a lot more from me. He’s right. I’m also frustrated with my performances. I must improve.’

Kurtley Beale has been allowed to join the Wallabies for their autumn internationals after avoiding the sack 

Maverick Australia back Kurtley Beale has been cleared to join the Wallabies’ tour of Europe after being fined AU$45,000 (£24,500) but avoiding the sack at a tribunal on Friday. He was found guilty of a serious breach of conduct for sending an offensive photograph to an ARU employee.

‘I will work to regain the respect of my team-mates, fans and the general Australian community,’ said Beale in a statement. ‘I am satisfied with tonight’s outcome. There was conjecture about my contract being terminated, however the tribunal agreed that, on the basis of the evidence, a fine was appropriate. I’m relieved there is no termination and no suspension and I can now continue playing rugby.’
