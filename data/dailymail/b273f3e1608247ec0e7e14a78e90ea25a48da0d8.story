The biggest play from Pinstripe Bowl was saved for halftime...in the broadcast booth.

While he's not known for choking in the commentator's box, ESPN's Chris Fowler yesterday needed the help of TV partner Jesse Palmer after downing a dry chicken sandwich.

Seeing his co-host in distress, the former Florida quarterback performed the 
Heimlich maneuver on Fowler, saving his life.

'Never before needed a Heimlich at halftime. (Or any time)!' Fowler tweeted during the game at New York's Yankee Stadium.

'Thanks Jesse Palmer! He saved me from death by dry chicken sandwich. Really.'

Fowler was doing play-by-play for the
 game at Yankee Stadium between Notre Dame and Rutgers.

Palmer, the 
former Florida and New York Giants quarterback, was the analyst.

Fowler also tweeted: 'Not bad to have quick thinking, ex-NFL player around when Heimlich needed. I'll take bruised ribs to avoid choking!'

Palmer, the 2004 'Bachelor' on the ABC reality show, said he had never before performed the Heimlich maneuver.

'It happened in the green room/viewing room behind ESPN's outdoor set during halftime,' Palmer told Front Row.

'Ed Placey (senior coordinating producer of ESPN's college football coverage) was standing with us at a high table while we were eating. The rest of the stage crew was in the room as well.

'I was watching Chris chew his food, and his eyes began to get big. He tried to swallow some water to clear his throat, then he had a look of panic on his face.'
