Islamic State has published a list of punishments ranging from 80 lashes for drinking alcohol and losing a hand for theft, to death for committing blasphemy.

The Sharia code of conduct will be enforced in areas under its control which now covers large swathes of Iraq and Syria.

Those who commit adultery will be stoned to death if the adulterer was married and lashed 100 times and exiled if he or she was unmarried.

Executions: The UN human rights office has condemned numerous executions of civilians in the country by Islamic State

Those engaged in sodomy (homosexuality) will be sentenced to death, along with those who 'spy for the unbelievers'.

Those who steal 'as part of banditry' will have their right hand and left leg cut off, and the punishment for terrorising people is exile.

Charlie Winter, a researcher for the counter-extremism think tank Quilliam, said the document appeared to be authentic. 

He told The Independent it was released on 16 December from the Aleppo branch of Isis. 

Last week, ISIS published pictures of the crucifixions of two men accused of being bandits, and of a woman being stoned to death, allegedly for adultery.

The terrorist group also released a video showing the two men being thrown off the top of a tower block in Raqqa, Syria, for being gay.

A masked Islamic State fighter announced the charges against the accused using a small handheld radio, before declaring them guilty of engaging in homosexual activities.

He said they should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State's radical interpretation of Sharia law.

The men were then bound and blindfolded before being pushed off the 100ft tower block to their deaths.

Back on the ground, men accused of banditry hung from the crosses in agony as their wrists were tightly bound with yellow and green ribbon

Down on the ground, two men accused of banditry have been tied to makeshift metal crosses.

Strung up tightly with yellow and green ribbon around their wrists, the men were hanged from the crosses, wincing in agony’. 

And it's believed the ISIS militants killed three of at least 15 pigeon breeders in Iraq after deciding it is against Islamic religion to keep birds this week.

The extremists also executed 13 teenage boys for watching the Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan last week.

The young football fans had been caught watching the game on television in the Iraqi city of Mosul, which is controlled by the Islamic State.

The teenagers were rounded up and publicly executed by a firing squad using machine guns, according to anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently.

The small activist group said the teenagers were rounded up by militants in the Al-Yarmouk district of Mosul after 'breaking religious laws' by watching football. 

Images also emerged of a woman, dressed in a black burqa, being stoned to death by a horde of ISIS militants.  

Four doctors were recently killed in central Mosul, allegedly after refusing to treat ISIS fighters.

The group also reportedly executed 15 civilians in front of a large crowd in Fallujah on January 1, on suspicion they had cooperated with Iraqi security forces, and 14 more in a public square in Dour, north of Tikrit, for refusing to pledge allegiance to ISIS, Shamdasani said.
