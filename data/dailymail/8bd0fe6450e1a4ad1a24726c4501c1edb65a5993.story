A woman has been jailed after she bit off another woman's ear while the pair's partners were fighting in a drunken pub brawl.

Paula Hammond attacked Gail Lowe at a working men's club and proceeded to sink her teeth into the victim's ear as their spouses argued about a pint of beer.

The 42-year-old attacker told Mrs Lowe she would 'bite her f***ing ear off' and repeatedly punched her, before tearing off a chunk of flesh and spitting it out.

A bystander put the piece of ear into a glass to preserve it, and the organ was re-attached during an operation which required Mrs Lowe, 39, to have 30 stitches.

The victim is still undergoing reconstructive surgery, and has suffered lasting psychological damage due to the traumatic assault at the the Alverthorpe Working Men's Club in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

Hammond, a shopkeeper, had denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent, claiming she was acting in self-defence, but was found guilty at Leeds Crown Court last Friday and sentenced to five years in prison.

Graham O'Sullivan, prosecuting, said that the attack came after Mrs Lowe had gone to the club with her husband Dean, 42, to watch a gig in November 2013.

He added: 'During the evening the victim's husband got into an altercation with a man. Paula Hammond then assaulted her.

'They fell to the floor or into a table. It was at this point Miss Hammond threatened to "bite her f***ing ear off".

'One witness saw her biting her ear. There was after that several punches delivered to Mrs Lowe's head.'

He continued: 'The severed ear was picked up by someone who had the presence of mind to put it into a glass.'

He said the victim later needed 'something in the region of 30 stitches in the hope it would heal', adding: 'Mrs Lowe has been left with an area of tissue which is dead and has needed reconstruction which is ongoing.'

Defence barrister James Littlehales claimed the offence came 'on the spur of the moment', adding: 'This clearly is a tragic case for all concerned. It is a very unusual case for a woman and totally out of character.

'She has appreciated what she has done and its psychological effect effect on the victim. She has genuine remorse.'

Judge Neil Clark told Hammond: 'You have been convicted of a very serious offence.

'Gail Lowe described being hit on the hit on the back of the head and falling forwards. She remembers you shouting you were going to bite her ear off.

'The witness could see your jaw moving. It was clearly a deliberate act. You then delivered a number of punches to her and walked away without showing any emotion.'

He told her that her five-year prison sentence had been aggravated by the fact that she was drunk at the time of the attack.

Speaking after the case, Mrs Lowe said that she thought the row had been sparked by a misunderstanding after her husband picked up a drink belonging to Hammond's partner.

'No one really knows why the fight kicked off between our partners,' she said. 'It seems he got angry when Dean picked up his pint glass by accident.'

The victim added: 'Life will never be the same again - the attack has affected me and all my family. I have teenage daughters and I get anxious every time they go out.

'I used to be a fairly confident person but my self-esteem has taken a big knock. I've been having counselling to help me move on.

'I've been left disfigured and obviously that's not a nice thing for a woman. I can't do little things like put my hair up because I'm worried people will look.

'Doctors said it would be impossible to re-attach my ear but I begged them to do it. They had to stretch the skin across as part of the reconstruction, but it's not the same shape as it used to be.'

Mrs Lowe said that the trauma had been worsened by Hammond's refusal to accept responsibility for the crime.

'She should have just pleaded guilty,' she said. 'She wouldn't own up to it and now she's been given a longer sentence as a result.'
