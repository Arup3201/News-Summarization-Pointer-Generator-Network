Customers at some Woolworths stores were in for an unexpected bargain late this afternoon when items they scanned came up as free.

A computer glitch affected customers scanning items under $10 at self-service lanes in some stores in NSW, Victoria and Tasmania, reported The Herald Sun.

A Woolworths spokesperson confirmed less than 20 stores stopped trading, but did not close their doors.

'And even then (trading stopped) just for a few minutes while they got confirmation from IT what was happening,' the spokesperson said.

Woolworth offered an apology to customers for any inconvenience caused but has not confirmed how much stock left the store for free.

The issued was resolved quickly, according to spokesperson, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

Social media reports that the glitch had forced the stores to close were incorrect, the spokesperson said.
