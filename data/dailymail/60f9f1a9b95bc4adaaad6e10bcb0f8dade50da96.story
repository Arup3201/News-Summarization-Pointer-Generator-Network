'A true gent': Mr Banks' death has stunned family and friends and has led to a slew of tributes to the musician and sculptor, who is described as 'one of life's nice guys and a true gent'

A musician died as he tried to retrieve a set of keys he dropped down a drain.

Father-of-two, Andy Banks, had been out at a pub in Liversedge, West Yorkshire, on New Years Day and he is believed to have fallen down the drain.

The 49-year-old is believed to have been walking home to nearby Dewsbury when the accident occurred.

It is not known exactly how he ended up falling down the roadside drain but it is believed he may have taken the grate off the top and he fell when he reached down for the keys.

Police were called at around 12.16am to a street in Heckmondwike.

Mr Banks' family and friends paid 
tribute to the musician and sculptor, who one described as 'one of 
life's nice guys and a true gent'.

Police were called at around 12.16am on Wednesday to a street in Heckmondwike, and neighbours reported seeing about seven response cars, a video van and a winch at the scene along with a special rescue unit from West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Team.

Friend Sharon Brogden had known him 
for about 20 years, she said he was a sensitive and generous man who had
recently opened rehearsal rooms in Dewsbury for bands to practice in.

'That's
something he decided to do, because that's the sort of person he was,' 
she said. 'He was very sensitive and very honest. I still can't get my 
head round what's happened.

'It wasn't his time to go. He had everything going. Everything seemed to be going well,' she added.

A well-loved local musician Mr Banks played in a number for bands but was perhaps best known for working with the eccentric Eric and the Viaduct.

He was also a member of Dewsbury Socialist Society, which lowered the Union Flag outside its club to half-mast yesterday.

Mr Banks was best known for playing the mandolin, but also played the banjo, flute and violin.

Michael Shepherd said: 'A wise, intelligent and talented musician, artist, 
sculptor, thinker and father who loved life.

'I
remember in his youth he had the words, "We were born to go as far as 
we can fly," written on his bedroom wall, which I have never forgotten.'
