A high profile barrister has been arrested after his teenage boyfriend died of a suspected drugs overdose.

Henry Hendron, 34, was questioned after waiter Miguel Jimenez was discovered at a flat in the Temple, London’s legal centre.

He was released on bail while toxicology tests are carried out on the body to determine the cause of death.

Mr Hendron, whose clients have included Tory MP Nadine Dorries and Apprentice winner Stella English, was fined last year for an online attack on witnesses due to testify at the rape trial of his friend, former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans.

The barrister, who as a teenager addressed the Conservative party conference demanding the return of corporal punishment, was yesterday too upset to comment about Mr Jimenez’s death.

But he posted a picture of his boyfriend on his Facebook page with the tribute: ‘it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all.’

His brother, Richard Hendron, said he was ‘completely devastated’.

Mr Jimenez, who described himself on Facebook as originally from the city of Cali in Colombia, was a popular barista at the Kahaila café in Shoreditch, east London, where fellow staff described him as an ‘amazing person.’

A statement from his family described him as a ‘young man with a bright future ahead of him.’

‘He was popular and was about to embark on an exciting career in marketing.

‘His has come as a complete shock to his friends and family and we are all devastated by his loss.’

A spokesman for City of London Police said: ‘Police were called at 08.58 on Tuesday 20 January to a residential address in the Temple following reports of a sudden death.

‘London Ambulance Service and City of London Police attended the scene. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

‘A post mortem began at Poplar Mortuary on Thursday 22 January. The coroner awaits the results of toxicology tests.

‘The death is being treated as unexplained at this time.

‘A 34 year old man has been arrested in connection with the investigation. He has been bailed until a date in March.’

A former Crown Prosecution Service prosecutor, Mr Hendron now works at Strand Chambers in London and charges up to £1,750 a day to represent clients in civil cases. 

'He is described on his website as 'impressive, determined and tenacious'. 

Law chiefs found him guilty of professional misconduct in November after he described alleged victims as 'manipulative and duplicitous’ on the eve of start date of the trial of Mr Evans. 

The Bar Standards Board fined him £2,000. 

Mr Evans, the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, was cleared in April of nine sexual offences against Parliamentary researchers, including raping a young man at his Lancashire home. 

As a 17-year-old schoolboy Mr Hendron was cheered as he addressed the 1998 Tory party conference calling for the reintroduction of corporal punishment.

The following year he was hailed by a newspaper as a potential next leader of the Conservative party after he made a citizens arrest on a would-be bank thief.
