The European Parliament has blocked Tory moves to scrap its second headquarters in Strasbourg to stop the monthly travelling circus between France and Brussels.

Most of the European Parliament’s work is done at a huge complex of offices and debating chambers in Brussels.

But once a month 766 MEPs, their 3,000 staff, and 25 trucks carrying documents move from Brussels to Strasbourg for a week long session at a cost of £150million-a-year.

The costs and CO2 emissions have soared as the Parliament has become bigger and more powerful.

The French have led opposition to the cost-saving move because the Strasbourg economy depends heavily on the monthly influx of MEPs, their officials and an army of lobbyists on fat expenses accounts.

An additional £12 million would be saved on maintenance on the Strasbourg building which is empty 300 days a year.

With the French economy on the verge of slipping into a triple dip recession the country’s MEPs are desperate to protect the historic and economic importance of the town ahead of the European Parliament elections in May. Hotels in Strasbourg are known to double or even triple their costs during the parliament’s sessions.

Strasbourg symbolises the European reconciliation after the Second World War as Germany is on the opposite bank of the river.

Last year the French government, which
 has plumbed record lows in popularity as the economy hovers close to 
triple dip recession, took legal action when MEPs tried to cut the 
number of sessions in Strasbourg each year.

Only
 last week a report by the British Tory MEP Ashley Fox was adopted by 
483 votes to 141 in favour of ending the link with Strasbourg on cost 
and efficiency grounds.

But the parliament’s Constitutional committee, in a closed session, quietly this week shelved the report.

With the eurozone also in a deep recession MEPs were trying to put an end to the cost of having two parliamentary bases and to use Brussels as the sole HQ. There are a further 2.400 staff working in Luxembourg.

More than one million EU citizens have signed a petition calling for the Parliament to be restricted to Brussels.

Ashley Fox, the Tory MEP for South West England and Gibraltar, whose report was accepted by three quarters of MEPs, said: ‘The vote this week is very disappointing.

‘Rotating between two different countries costs at least £150 million a year and is an unacceptable waste of taxpayers’ money.  Over the parliament’s seven-year long term budget this will in fact cost taxpayers a staggering £928 million. In hard economic times, there are so many better things that could be spent on rather than empty buildings and needless and often complex journeys.’

The transport alone to Strasbourg creates an estimated 19,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

‘Think how foolish the parliament looks when it allows this while lecturing its citizens about climate change,’ said Mr Fox.

‘The French led the opposition as they are desperate to stop this happening before the European elections in May when the ruling Socialists are going to be hammered because of the state of their economy.’

Dan Hannan, a fellow British Tory MEP, said: ‘The principle that the European Parliament should meet in just one place is a small thing – a tiny thing, when we consider the billions squandered in regional, structural and agricultural boondoggles. But, in the current economic climate, saving £150 million a year matters.‘

But one French MEP Constance le Grip defended Strasbourg’s role. ‘You are turning your backs on the history and the founding principles of the EU,’ she said.
