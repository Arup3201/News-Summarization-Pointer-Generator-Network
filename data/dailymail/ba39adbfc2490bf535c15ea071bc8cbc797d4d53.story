Lewis Hamilton’s inspiration, of a sort, hid in the trees at the sun-kissed Hockenheim circuit on Friday.

At the apex of the Einfahrt Parabolika, the acute right-hander at the end of the first sector, lies the resting place of the man regarded as the greatest motor racing driver produced in Britain — a double world champion cut down in the prime of his life.

A simple memorial, encroached upon by weeds, shrouded by firs and white flowers, marks the spot at which Jim Clark — or James Clark as Hamilton recently referred to him — crashed and died during a Formula Two race in April 1968.

Eyes on the ball: Mercedes drivers Rosberg and Hamilton played on their friendship rather than their rivalry

That Clark even participated in an unglamorous sideshow represents a difference from the Formula One mentality of today: there is no time for anything but the one-dimensional top rung in 2014.

The fear of death stalked the paddock in Clark’s day. A few years later another great British champion, James Hunt, said that although people would deny it  forever, they came to see someone get killed.

Up on the screens here at Hockenheim they played out old rivalries, Ayrton Senna and Damon Hill among them. Oh, they were less sanitised days.

Here the two protagonists for the world championship, Hamilton and Rosberg, were more keen to play on their friendship than play up their animosity.

The two Mercedes men arrived for Saturday’s German Grand Prix in the Eichelgarten woods with the comments Hamilton made about Rosberg being less than a genuine Teuton providing the background.

Hamilton half-joked that his old mucker was really a Monegasque. He lives in Monaco (as does Hamilton) and grew up there. His father, the 1982 world champion Keke, is Finnish. His mother, Sina, is German.

Chase: Hamilton trails Rosberg by four points at the top of the drivers' standings going into Germany

But Rosberg, who leads Hamilton at the top of the drivers’ standings by four points, said: ‘I really don’t get into such things. Everybody’s free to have his opinions. I was there and it was more or less a joke, so for me it’s not relevant. I have two home races.’

This is Rosberg all over: focused, unwilling to countenance distractions.

The rivalry may have blown up this season at Monaco, when Rosberg’s diversion off the road brought about a yellow flag that blocked Hamilton’s quest for pole. The Brit thought it deliberate; the German said not.

But cordiality has broken out (even if Lewis was not among the small group of family and friends at Rosberg’s wedding to Vivian last week — in Monaco). The corporate blanket has doused the fire.

That may be something to do with the predicted attendance of 50,000 for race day, 25,000 short of capacity. ‘We have to analyse the phenomenon,’ admitted Mercedes’s commercial boss Toto Wolff.

The other reason for the poor crowd is that home favourite Michael Schumacher is sadly on his back in a Swiss hospital rather than out here racing.

Rosberg was fastest in Friday’s first practice session; Hamilton fastest in the second. Red Bull also seem to have narrowed the gap to Mercedes.

The consensus is that Hamilton’s win at Silverstone a fortnight ago has given him extra belief, even if he won by default after Rosberg broke down.

The other news here was that Susie Wolff, 32-year-old wife of Toto, completed her second and final practice session for Williams. She managed to get herself an £800 fine for speeding in the pit lane.

Apart from that it was a respectable showing but, given her age, she probably won’t take part in a race weekend again.
