Her profile is one of the most famous in the world and is seen every day on coins, stamps and bank notes, but now, the Queen is to get a new look.

A new coin portrait of Her Majesty has been unveiled by the Royal Mint and will be used on currency from this year.

The effigy, which was designed by engraver Jody Clark, is only the fifth official coin portrait made during the Queen's 63-year reign and replaces the current one, which first appeared in 1998.

New look: The latest coin portrait of the Queen has been unveiled by the Royal Mint

Familiar: The profile, which shows the Queen in the George IV diadem, will be used on coins from 2015 on

Unlike the previous one, which shows Her Majesty in the Girls of Great Britain tiara, the new portrait shows her wearing the George IV State Diadem and a delicate pair of  drop earrings.

Commissioned in 1820 by George IV, the diadem, which is most often seen during the State Opening of Parliament, has 1,333 diamonds and 169 pearls, arranged in rose, thistle and shamrock designs to represent England, Scotland and Ireland.

Like its owner, the diadem also has a long history of appearing on coins and bank notes, having appeared on currency belonging to the UK, Australia, Canada and the British Caribbean territories among many others.

The new portrait was chosen from a selection of anonymously submitted designs, with creator Jody Clark becoming, at 34, the youngest engraver ever to create a royal coin portrait.

Creator: 34-year-old engraver Jody Clark, from the Lake District, created the winning design 

New look: The new coin portrait is only the fifth to be produced during the Queen's reign, with the first in 1953

'I really liked the four previous coin portraits - each one is strong in its own way,' says a delighted Mr Clark. 'I hope that I’ve done Her Majesty justice and captured her as I intended. 

'The news that my design had been chosen was quite overwhelming, and I still can’t quite believe that my royal portrait will be featured on millions of coins.'

Speaking about the decision to award Mr Clark the job, Kevin Clancy, director of the Royal Mint Museum, said the judging panel’s decision was 'pretty unanimous'.

Mr Clark, who is originally from the Lake District, says his family are 'really proud', adding: 'They’ve had to keep quiet about this.

'It’s going to be hard to top this. It’s going to take a while to sink in. I’m really happy with how it’s turned out. I can only hope everyone appreciates it.' 

The first coin portrait of the Queen's reign appeared in 1953, shortly after she took the throne, and was designed by Mary Gillick.

Although the four subsequent designs show her wearing a crown, her first portrait showed a fresh-faced young Queen wearing nothing more than an evergreen wreath.

That all changed when a new coin portrait entered circulation in April 1968, which showed a sterner version of the Queen in the George IV diadem.

The image, which was designed by Arnold Machin, was replicated on stamps and remains one of the most famous portraits of the Queen ever created.

In 1985 came another new coin portrait, this time by Raphael Maklouf who once again showed the monarch in the George IV diadem.

Unusually, the new portrait proved controversial with Maklouf accused of making the effigy 'flatteringly youthful'.

Unimpressed, he swiftly hit back at critics, telling them his intention had been to create something 'regal and ageless'.

For the fourth coin portrait of the Queen, which replaced Maklouf's design in 1997, Her Majesty chose to wear the magnificent Girls of Great Britain tiara.

The gem, which was made for Queen Mary on the occasion of her wedding in 1893, is one of the most spectacular in the Royal Collection and features 13 brilliant-cut diamonds as its centrepiece.

Along with its appearance on the 1997 coins, it was also worn by the Queen to marry the Duke of Edinburgh in November 1947.
