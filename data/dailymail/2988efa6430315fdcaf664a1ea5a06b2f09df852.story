It is one of the most well-known buildings to pierce London's skyline.

And for house hunters scouring the capital for their new abode, Battersea Power Station could soon be a place they call home.

But securing one of the most sought-after new addresses in London will come with a price tag to match, as experts predict penthouses will fetch up to £30million each.

For sale: More than 250 apartments and townhouses built within the iconic Battersea Power Station are set to go on the market on May 1

Sought-after: Prices will be released by developers in April but experts predict that penthouses will sell for up to £30million each

More than 250 flats built in the imposing Grade II* listed building are set to go on the market on May 1.

The new homes will range in size from studio apartments to sprawling five-bedroom 'villas' positioned beneath the four distinctive towers that have stood on the banks of The Thames since 1933.

The 254 properties will be located within the existing facades of the western and eastern flanks of the former Power Station and on top of the central boiler house.

Those positioned on the boiler house will frame a new 'garden in the sky'.

Prices will not be announced until April and the Battersea Power Station Development Company said this second phase of the development will only be up for sale in London.

Prospective buyers will have to register their interest and attend allocated sales appointments.

The redevelopment of the building will create 15,000 new jobs, 3,500 new homes and a privately-funded extension of the London Underground at Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station.

New home: The flats range from studio apartments to sprawling five-bedroom 'villas' with roof terraces boasting views across The Thames

Redevelopment: The newly-modelled Power Station will feature 200 shops and restaurants a state-of-the-art performance venue, cinema, six-acre riverside park and a new Underground tube station, which will connect to the Northern line

Second phase: The latest stage in the development will see flats marketed in London alone, as developers aim to entice people already living in the capital to the new community

Rob Tincknell, Chief Executive of Battersea Power Station Development Company,said: 'This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to own one of a relatively small number of fantastic homes being created in the iconic Power Station itself.

'Having awaited development for 30 years, this famous London landmark is now being restored and given a new lease of life and will be home to events space, shops, restaurants, offices and a limited number of new homes.

'There has been a lot of comment recently about London’s housing problems and we believe the only way to try and solve this is to build great homes and create a community that people actually want to live in.

'We are proud to be launching these new homes in London only, and this decision is part of a wider strategy to create a product well-suited for owner occupiers and people who will help us create a real and lasting community here in Battersea.'

The Power Station will form the heart of a wider 40-acre development, which will include office space for around 5,000 people, around 200 shops and restaurants, a state-of-the-art performance venue, cinema and a boutique hotel as well as a new six-acre riverside park.
