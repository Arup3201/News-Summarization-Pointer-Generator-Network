There was nothing surprising or unexpected in watching Alan Pardew explode with rage at St James’ Park this weekend. 

The Newcastle United manager has two distinct sides to his character: a sort of Jekyll and Hyde. The one seen away from the heat of battle is a smiling, charming, innocent ‘cheeky chap’ who is ‘doing ever so well’ on limited resources at Newcastle. The other will do whatever is needed to try to wring out any advantage for his team.

As we have seen, he is also prone to combustible behaviour — and he seems to think that whatever is said or insinuated when under pressure can be forgiven and forgotten with an apology.

Unsavoury: Pardew later apologised for calling Pellegrini a 'f****** old c***'

Bone of contention: Pardew was raging because referee Mike Jones disallowed Cheick Tiote's goal

I remember Pardew best for his comments in the tunnel at half-time, when he was always looking to sow seeds of doubt and open up the possibility of gaining his side an advantage. He would try to influence you by painting the picture that his team were already getting the rough end of the stick.

Those observations were delivered ‘in passing’ and usually out of earshot of others, which tended to make them hard to ignore and impossible to report. 

He certainly put his own slant on one particular match when I was refereeing his Charlton team and the whole episode left me open to accusations of favouring his team. 

After that game at The Valley between Charlton and Reading, Pardew said how well I had done in signalling to the bench that one of his players, the on-loan Alex Song, was one foul away from a red card.

This, he said, had afforded him the opportunity to replace Song. I had no issue with what had happened, but he made it appear that we had arranged the whole thing in the tunnel at half-time, which was untrue.

Giving some back: Pellegrini and Pardew had a fiery exchange of words on the touchline

It's not over yet: Pardew pointed the finger as Jones made his way down the tunnel at half-time

History: Graham Poll (left) talks to then West Ham manager Pardew after a 0-0 draw at Fulham in 2004

Before the 2004 First Division play-off final, when he was manager of West Ham, Pardew had a word with me about Tomas Repka at the exchange of team sheets. We all knew Repka was a physical player whose effectiveness was often nullified after a yellow card, so Pardew tried to pressurise me into not cautioning him on such a big stage. Repka was the first West Ham player cautioned that afternoon.

Pardew had every cause to complain after Mike Jones disallowed a perfectly good goal for offside on Sunday. It would have equalised Manchester City’s opening effort and put Newcastle back in the match. But there can be no defence of the disgraceful outburst to which Pardew subjected City manager Manuel Pellegrini.

One can only assume that Martin Atkinson, the fourth official, did not hear the comment, which was picked up on TV. Perhaps Atkinson’s hearing was muffled by his ‘beanie’ hat. 

Being the fourth official in the middle of warring managers is an almost impossible task, made even more difficult by the trend not to report players — let alone managers — for abusive or insulting comments. 

The last thing the referee needs is to be called over to the technical area to dismiss a manager, particularly the home one after denying them a goal. He’s better off in the middle, away from the angry crowd — and there are few more vocal than the Toon Army. Imagine the reaction if Atkinson had reported Pardew to Jones and they had removed him from the technical area.

Friend or foe? Jose Mourinho, during his first spell at Chelsea, gives Graham Poll an earful at Stamford Bridge

On the receiving end: Sir Alex Ferguson was renowned for his bullish approach with match officials

Atkinson found himself in a tough position, one that wasn’t helped by the fact that there really has been no clear directive on what is and what is not seen as acceptable behaviour. Too much is left to interpretation, which encourages managers to push their luck.

Pardew was not the first, nor the only manager, to try to get inside my head. Arsene Wenger adopted a similar approach, carefully making a comment at a time he thought it would have maximum impact and might influence your thinking.

His demeanour and gravitas meant he was more effective than Pardew, complaining and pleading for more protection for his players. It was delivered so well that you often found yourself giving more free-kicks to Arsenal early in the second half.

Sir Alex Ferguson was quite the opposite: subtlety was not a tool he employed. It was full-frontal, in-your-face fury. The first season I refereed at Old Trafford he was into my dressing room after the final whistle to give me the full ‘hairdryer’ treatment over the fact that I had not added on enough time. United drew that game!

Wily: Mourinho's preferred tactic was to befriend officials in a bid to curry favour on the pitch

Jose Mourinho worked quite differently: he wanted you to think of him as a friend — and as a result he expected favours, which meant he would be hurt when you dealt with his team in exactly the same way as any other.

In his first pre-season at Stamford Bridge he invited me to a meeting with all of his players and introduced me as the best referee in Europe!

As for Pardew, he is well aware that he went way too far and his apology should not have prevented the FA from imposing a touchline ban. 

Whatever the provocation, however bad the decision, all managers must remember their position and keep their composure and dignity.

Bad day: Mike Jones made the wrong call for Newcastle's 'goal'

The incident has led to calls for the offside law to be revised.  But the law is clearly defined and needs no adjustment — it just needs to be applied correctly. This is the law in its simplest form:

When the ball is played forward to a colleague in the opponents’ half of the field:

WHY MIKE JONES GOT IT WRONG

Three Newcastle players were in offside positions when the ball was played forward, but they should not have been penalised as they did not touch the ball, interfere with opponents or obstruct Joe Hart’s line of sight.
