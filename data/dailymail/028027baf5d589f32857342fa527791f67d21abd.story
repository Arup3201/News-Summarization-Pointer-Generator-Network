A stylist employed by hairdresser Daniel Hersheson was left scarred for life after her clothes were set on fire by a candle at his flagship beauty salon, a court heard.

Gail Purcell was badly burnt after the horrific accident at Mr Hersheson’s boutique in Conduit Street in the heart of London’s West End.

Mr Hersheson is the head of a family beauty dynasty which includes his wife Ruth, son Luke, and daughter Lauren, and whose clients have included the Duchess of Cambridge, the socialite Tara Palmer Tomkinson, the model Pixie Geldof and the actress Sienna Miller.

His firm, Rudan Ltd, accepted responsibility for the fire which broke out at the salon on May 29, 2009.

Sarah Lefevre, prosecuting on behalf of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, told Westminster Magistrates’ Court: ‘Ms Purcell felt a warmth to her legs and when she looked down she saw flames.

‘No fire alarm was sounded, nobody appeared to know what to do, and no first aid was administered to her.’

Ms Purcell was taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital following the fire, which was caused by candles placed around the salon for atmosphere.

‘She will be scarred for life and has suffered considerable discomfort’, said Ms Lefevre.

‘She has been away from work for a period of time and has been advised to keep out of the sun for a period measurable in years.’

Fire investigators found the fire alarms at the salon were faulty, staff were untrained at dealing with emergencies, and there was a substandard fire risk assessment in place.

It also emerged fire doors at the luxury boutique were routinely propped open.

Ms Lefevre added that a proper risk assessment at the salon was carried out by LFEPA after the fire, showing why the original document was ‘far from satisfactory’.

The company admitted two offences under fire safety legislation at magistrates’ court and faced a maximum £10,000 fine.

But District Judge Andrew Sweet decided his sentencing powers were not enough and opted to send the case to Southwark Crown Court at a date to be fixed where unlimited fines can be handed out.

‘I reached my view based on the facts brought to my attention today’, he said. ‘My powers of sentencing in this court are not adequate to reflect the appropriate sentence, and for that reason I’m of the view the case should be sent to the crown court.’
