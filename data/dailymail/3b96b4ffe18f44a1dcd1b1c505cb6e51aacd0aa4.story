A 53-year-old woman has been banned from owning an animal for 20 years after neglecting her two dogs so badly they needed to be put down.

Peta Brien was convicted of animal cruelty offences in the Perth Magistrates Court on Friday after failing to provide sufficient food and water for the dogs and failing to take steps to alleviate harm to them.

She was also sentenced to a one-year, community-based order and ordered to pay costs of $1083.

Both had been abandoned at a Maylands property and were emaciated, but one of the dogs, a two-year-old Maltese shitzu cross named Little Man, was found lying lifeless and whining, suffering dehydration, conjunctivitis and ulcerated eyes.

Little Man also had severely matted fur and grass seeds embedded in his skin, which had caused severe infection and maggots in and around his hind region.

RSPCA WA chief inspector Amanda Swift said the penalty was appropriate because a person who treated dogs so poorly did not deserve the privilege of owning one.
