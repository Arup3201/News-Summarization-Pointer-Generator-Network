A cat is up for a top moggy award after tapping on a next-door neighbour's window to get their attention after his owner collapsed at home.

Tomcat Slinky Malinki came to Janet Rawlinson's rescue by rapping out an SOS with his paw which alerted Mel and Stephen Sharp.

Former nurse and mother-of-one Janet, of Cornholme, Lancashire, was drifting in and out of consciousness for five days after suffering a reaction to morphine she was taking for back pain.

But the normally aloof two-year-old cat saved the day and has now been nominated for a hero award at the Cats Protection charity's National Cat Awards in London.

Ms Rawlinson, 48, credits Slinky with 'saving my life'.

She said: 'Slinky was on the fence outside, trying to get the neighbours' attention.

'He was tormenting their dog as well to get their attention.

When Slinky's owner collapsed the moggy tapped on his neighbours window to raise the alarm

'They realised they hadn't seen me for a few days so tried the front door with the spare key, but my key was in the door.

'They got in through the back and managed to wake me up. My neighbour said he thought I was dead.'

Ms Rawlinson, a former nurse at Royal Blackburn Hospital who had to give up work due to ill-health, said Slinky now keeps a closer eye on her.

Ms Rawlinson said Slinky has become even more attentive since the incident, checking on her regularly

She said: 'If he doesn't see me go in for a couple of hours he will come into the house and find me, and if I don't see him he will tap me on the leg or arm until I respond.

'He never did that until the incident with the morphine.'

Ms Rawlinson said Slinky is also playing carer to two 12-week-old kittens she has rescued.

Slinky is up against two other felines for the hero award which will be announced on August 7.

If he wins he will also be in the running for the overall title of National Cat of the Year.

Ms Rawlinson said: 'He is like a gentlemanly uncle. That is how he treats everybody.'
