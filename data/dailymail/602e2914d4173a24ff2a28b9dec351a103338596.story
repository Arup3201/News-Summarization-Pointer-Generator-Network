Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari should keep his job because of the good work he did during his 19 months in charge, the president-elect of the Brazilian Football Confederation has argued (CBF).

The Selecao were humiliated 7-1 in the World Cup semi-final by Germany to be eliminated from a tournament hosted in their own country but Scolari should not be sacked according to Marco Polo Del Nero.

'To me, he stays,' Del Nero told the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper.

Right man for the job? Brazil Football Confederation's president-elect thinks manager Luiz Felipe Scolari is still the right man for the job despite the humiliating 7-1 semi-final loss to Germany in their home World Cup

'What happened was a tactical error. That was the problem. But we all make mistakes. It can happen to anyone.

'The important thing is that he did a good job. The campaign and the preparations were good. A base exists.'

It was the first time Del Nero or Jose Maria Marin, the man he will replace as head of the CBF next April, have spoken about the historic defeat.

Scolari, who led Brazil to their fifth World Cup title in 2002, has not revealed his long term plans. He will lead Brazil in Saturday's third place play-off match against Holland.

The former Chelsea and Portugal manager has lost just three times in 28 matches since taking over in November 2012.

However, many fans called for his head after Brazil's heaviest ever World Cup defeat against Germany.
