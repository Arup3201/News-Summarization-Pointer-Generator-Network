You might want to think twice about stopping off at a motorway service station for a bite to eat - you don't know who you'll be sharing the rest-stop with.

Bait was used to attract rats at the South Mimms M25 service station to illustrate the vermin problem which one man puts down to service station design.

Photographer Tony Margiocchi believes the rats are living in the hedges placed around service stations.

Unwelcome visitor: This rat got more than a mouthful when he stumbled across a carefully placed sardine at South Mimms Service Station

Rats appeared several times over a two-hour period and feasted on carefully placed sardines as the sun went down.

'I believe the main reason these vermin are present is because they have a purpose built living environment of close hedging which allows them to access all outside areas of the services,' said Margiocchi.

'In short they have been given a very good home when to remove the hedges would make the area less prone to vermin.

'This I believe is a prevalent mistake by many services throughout the UK in an effort to make their parking look more pleasant to the eye rather then safe from vermin.' 

Any remaining bait was removed after the photos were taken.

The vermin, attracted by bird food and rubbish, has the potential to 
spread a wide variety of diseases including Weil’s disease and food 
poisoning like salmonella.

What do we have here? Rats at South Mimms are taking whatever they can get their paws on

The South Mimms services are operated by Welcome Break at Junction 23 in Hertfordshire.

The services boast a Waitrose, KFC, Burger King, Coffee Primo and Eat In. There is also a picnic-area and a children's playground outside.

A comment left about South Mimms by Mel Day on the Motorway Services website reads: 'If you like to see rats running about this car park is the place for you! There are several large ones scuttling about from bin to bin in the service area car park. I dread to think where else they may be on the site; I prefer not to eat there. Definitely a case for a good rat catcher.'
