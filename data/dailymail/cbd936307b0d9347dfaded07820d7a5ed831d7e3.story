You stay classy, North Dakota!

His witty one-liners, similar to those in 2004's Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, had the program hosts in stitches.

'Amber, you look lovely tonight. Are you married?' Ferrell asked a giggling Schatz.

When she said no, he responded: 'Well I am, so don't get any ideas.'

The hilarious actor read news updates for the weather and sport, and introduced a light-hearted story about facial hair.

When one of the hosts asked 'Ron' how long it took him to grow his famous mo, the dapper journalist joked: 'Twenty minutes'.

Ferrell is doing the promotional rounds ahead of the December 18 release of Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.
