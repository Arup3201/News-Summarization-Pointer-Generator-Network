Speaking at the event, he said: 'It was absolutely wonderful. We really weren't expecting that many people to arrive, not as many as this.

'There are about three hundred people here, maybe more. It wasn't organised by the family but by a lady who wishes to remain anonymous., but we heard about it and decided to come.'

He added: 'Lots of people have been holding events in Becky's memory but we haven't heard about them until after, so it was great we heard about this one in time to come.

Following the ascent, which included heart-shaped balloons and balloons in the shape of teddy bears, the crowd let out a small cheer.

Becky's father watched the balloons float away, with the rest of his family, before bursting into tears.

Fundraising buckets were also being passed around at the event, to raise money in Becky's memory.

Lara Carpenter-Beck, a relative of Becky's, who is organising the fundraising efforts, said: 'It was quite touching, it was wonderful.

'It was all bright and colourful which was a bit of a twist to how things turned out. It is a nice way to leave things.

'It's nice to know people are thinking about Becky and that people really do care. It was amazing so many people turned out, especially considering the weather wasn't great.'

Becky disappeared from her father's home in St George, Bristol, on February 19.

Mr Galsworthy reported her missing the following afternoon and police issued their first public appeal three days after she was last seen.

Avon and Somerset Police launched a huge search operation involving six police teams and Becky's distraught family made emotional public appeals for her to return home.
