A startling new picture has emerged showing a gun-toting pro-Russian rebel posing in front of the same type of BUK missile launcher that is believed to have shot down MH17.

Evidence is continuing to mount up that Moscow and Russian-backed separatists were behind the plane crash.

Fresh satellite imagery also suggests that there were two BUK launchers in the vicinity of the incident which happened last Thursday.

'Smoking gun': This picture has emerged of a pro-Russian rebel posing in front of the same type of BUK missile launcher that is believed to have shot down MH17

Something to hide? The rebel, named as Sergei Paschenko, deleted his social media account soon after the image spread across the internet

A pro-Kiev news website directly links
 the image to the stricken plane, with a headline claiming: 'Right 
before the crash of Boeing 777, a terrorist from Donetsk People's 
Republic proudly posted his pictures in front of BUK.'

The website obozrevatel.com includes a 
message for the man, named as Sergei Paschenko, saying: 'You are a real 
hero. You did NOT betray Ukraine. You provided clear evidence that BUK 
was Russian. Well done.'

Soon after the picture spread across the web today, Paschenko, who is said to have served previously in Russia's air defence troops, suddenly deleted his account.

A video showing a user browsing his account clearly shows this.

Satellite images have also been obtained which show two Buk-M1 air defence missiles in the bottom left hand corner.

If Russian BUKs were supplied to the rebels in Donetsk, it is unclear when exactly they were sent.

Some accounts suggest they were secretly smuggled across the border this month, while others say earlier. 

Other pictures indicate that he did indeed belong to the pro-Russian rebels in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and held strong views hostile to pro-Western campaigners in Kiev, although there is no clue as to where the picture was taken.

The message in the top left corner reads: 'Zaroshchenskoye'. The message in the bottom left corner reads: 'Two self-propelled turrets Buk-M1 Air Defence Missile System'. The message in the bottom right corner reads: 'one armoured vehicle'

Nor is it clear when the image was actually taken.

Despite
 this, another source of this picture was blocked in Moscow on the 
orders of the Russian prosecutor-general two days after the plane was 
blasted out of the sky, it appears.

This source cannot be opened.

Paschenko's deleted social media site contained dialogue with a woman called Viktoria dated June 25.

She asked: 'So what detachment you are serving in?'

He replied: 'In a secret one.'

She asked: 'Is it really so secret?'

He replied:  'Yes, this is the most secret air defence ever.'

Offending launcher? A driver filmed this BUK missile system on the back of a military track rumbling back across the Russian border on Saturday

Before its deletion, it also carried a picture of a Ukrainian flag in a toilet, apparently to show his views.

The image of the rebel with the BUK missile launcher was made public as the Russian and Ukrainian sides have stepped up accusations of 'propaganda' and 'lies' over the downing of MH17.

It comes after a series of apparent sightings of the smoking gun BUK in recent days.

Over the weekend, footage emerged taken by a driver followed this military truck on a main road for two kilometres in a 'border area' of Russia before uploading the footage, filmed with a dashboard camera, on the internet.

The cargo had no escort and Ukrainian sources have seized on it, captioning the footage: 'A Russian blogger filmed the BUK M1 in Russia, the one that shot the Boeing.'

It was filmed at around 8.45pm on Saturday.

Reports from Ukraine suggested the BUK had been smuggled in the dead of night into Russia soon after the plane was blasted out of the sky on Thursday last week.

Other images have been released of a launcher rumbling through Torez, held by pro-Russian separatists, just two hours before the Malaysia Airlines flight was shot down.
