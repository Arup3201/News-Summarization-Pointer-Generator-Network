A pair of burglars have been jailed for breaking into a cafe late at night because they 'fancied a piece of quiche'.

Barry Kirsopp and Dean Thompson sparked a six-hour police siege after they refused to leave a roadside cafe near Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland.

The pair were surrounded by 30 officers and 15 patrol cars, while Kirsopp threatened the police with kitchen knives and a broomstick which he had fashioned into a spear.

Yesterday they were jailed at Newcastle Crown Court after both pleading guilty to burglary and affray.

Kirsopp, 21, was given a 26-month sentence after the judge ruled that he was the ringleader, while Thompson, 20, was sentenced to 22 months.

The incident took place at Cafe@Marshalls, in Stremerton, on August 12 this year.

Police officers and negotiators, who were waiting outside the building with tasers, took six hours to convince them to give themselves up.

During sentencing yesterday, prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw said: 'The offence of burglary develops into a stand off between the defendants and the police.

'Various threats are made, particularly by Kirsopp who states he is not coming out. He arms himself with two kitchen knifes and he gets a hold of a broomstick and makes a spear.

'This continues for some time, both defendants behave in an aggressive and threatening way from 12.30am until 6.30am.'

Ian O'Rourke, defending, said the only explanation they offered for the break-in when they finally surrendered was that they 'fancied a piece of quiche.'

He added: 'That remark was picked up by the media and this case attracted a lot of publicity. They have had the mickey taken out of them.

'It is not something that was planned in any way, in fact it is something that was carried out under the nose of the police. Of course the offence was aggravated by the fact that both of them took drink and drugs on that night.'

Recorder Paul Camp told Kirsopp: 'You made a spear out out of a broomstick and held out from 12.30am to 6.30am in the morning.

'I think the picture that emerges is someone who without drink is a hard working, reasonable man. The combination of drink and drugs turns you into a very different person.'

He told Thompson: 'You played the lesser part in this affray. Although you did not arm yourself, you are jointly responsible and there is not much difference in terms of responsibility.'

Kirsopp was sentenced to an additional 40 weeks in jail for breaching a previous suspended sentence imposed when he was convicted of burglary.

After the incident in August, Howard Marshall, co-owner of the cafe, said: 'We were called out at one o'clock in the morning by police.

'The burglars had got in to our cafe through the back window and trashed the place. They grabbed the kitchen knives and were refusing to come out.

'They left the cakes and ate the quiche. They also found a bottle of wine which we used for cooking.'
