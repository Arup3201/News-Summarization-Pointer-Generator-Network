Ed Miliband today accused TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson of ‘belittling’ people with mental health problems.

The Labour leader used a speech in central London to criticise the Top Gear host, who he claimed was responsible for promoting a culture of ‘intolerance’.

Mr Mililband said stars were wrong to make light of mental illness, as he unveiled plans to tackle what he called ‘the biggest unaddressed health challenge of our age’.

Ed Miliband criticised celebrities who 'belittle' people with mental health problems

In a speech at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Labour leader set out what he called a One Nation approach to mental health

He praised the example of people like cricketer Marcus Trescothick and television presenter Stephen Fry for speaking out about their battles with depression.

But he said ‘far too often’ there was ‘scepticism and abuse’ that reinforced the taboo about mental health meaning many people who struggle with it do not feel able to discuss it or seek help.

‘It's not just casual name calling in the streets or the school playground. There are still people who abuse the privilege of their celebrity to insult, demean and belittle others,’ he said in a speech at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

He added: ‘Jeremy Clarkson, who may have at least have acknowledged the tragedy of people who end their own lives, goes on to call them "Johnny Suicides" whose bodies should be left on train tracks rather than delay journeys.

‘It is attitudes like these that reinforce the stigma that blights millions of people's lives, and holds our country back.

'The fight against racism, against 
sexism and against homophobia, made the acceptable unacceptable. So we 
should join the fight against this intolerance. It is wrong, it costs 
Britain dear, and it has to change.’

Mr Miliband criticised celebrities like Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson who made fun of people with a mental illness

Jeremy Clarkson caused controversy last December after criticising people who kill themselves on train lines.

The
 notorious presenter said that anyone who committed suicide in this way 
was 'very selfish' for traumatising train drivers and inconveniencing 
commuters.

The outburst came just days after a joke about executing public 
sector workers for going on strike cause outcry.

In a newspaper column he
 wrote that killing oneself by jumping in front of a train 'is a very 
selfish way to go because the disruption it causes is immense.'

He went on to label those who killed themselves 'Johnny Suicide'.

Clarkson claimed that train drivers involved in these cases are 
'traumatised for life', and complained that passengers would 'have to 
sit around for hours'.

And 
he added that trains should not wait until all the remains of the body 
had been removed from tracks, saying - grotesquely - that drivers should
 instead 'get the train moving as soon as possible and let foxy woxy and
 the birds nibble away at the smaller, gooey parts that are far away and
 hard to find.'

However, in
 his article for The Sun Mr Clarkson stressed that he had 'the deepest 
sympathy for anyone whose life is so mangled and messed up that they 
believe death's icy embrace will be better.

    He accepted that politicians had also largely failed to take a lead on the issue.

‘For far too long leading politicians from all parties, including my own, have maintained an almost complete silence about mental health,’ he said.

Mental illness creates additional costs for the NHS of £10 billion in the provision of extra physical care, while the wider economy loses £26 billion a year to sickness absence, replacing staff and reduced productivity caused, he said.

'Now there will be some people who say that mental health is the kind of subject we can talk about in the good times, but not when the economy is such a priority.

'In my view, that is the opposite of the truth. Because mental health is an economic challenge holding back prosperity.

'Because however hard the economic challenges, we cannot forget about people's quality of life. And, finally, if we want a politics that talks directly to the challenges that British people face in their everyday lives, we cannot allow the silence to continue.'

Mr Miliband announced the creation of a taskforce headed by the chair of Barts NHS Trust, Stephen O'Brien, to draw up a strategic plan for mental health in society.
