'Emotionally fragile': PC Jamie Hillman funded an extramarital affair by fraudulently raking in £70,000 bank loans

A policeman who funded an extramarital affair with by fraudulently raking in £70,000 in bank loans walked free from court after a judge branded him as 'emotionally fragile'.

PC Jamie Hillman, 37, defrauded more than half a dozen high street banks, including Northern Rock and Barclays, by applying for loans and credit cards.

He made several false claims during the applications - including that he was a sergeant in the Metropolitan Police and even that he was a soldier serving in Afghanistan.

However, he was using the cash to fund a 'double life' as he conducted an affair with a colleague at Avon and Somerset Police.

The greedy PC fled to Australia with the cash but was finally cornered when he returned to Britain to meet up with his lover.

But
Hillman - who claimed he had amnesia while committing the fraud - was 
spared jail by Judge Carol Hagen at Bristol Crown Court.

She
branded him 'emotionally fragile' and 'brave' for admitting his 
misdemeanours - handing him a 12 month prison term suspended for two 
years.

The court heard that 
father-of-two Hillman had come to Britain from Australia with his wife 
and began working as a PC for Avon and Somerset Police in 1999.

But his deception began after he struck up an extramarital affair with a colleague.

Web of lies: Hillman defrauded more than half a dozen high street banks, including Northern Rock and Barclays (pictured)

Between January and April 2008 he defrauded half a dozen high street banks by using false information to apply for loans and credit cards online.

The total amounted to £64,300 - rising to £73,366.30 with interest.

Stephen Mooney, prosecuting, said: 
'He embarked upon a course of obtaining loans and credit cards which he 
used in part to finance his double life.

'He lied about significant personal details, knowing if he said the truth it would not be granted.

'When it was granted he used it to fund his lifestyle and created excuses for his bizarre behaviour.

'Lying had become a way of life for this defendant.'

The
court heard he secured a £12,000 loan from Co-Op Bank and £12,000 from 
Halifax by claiming to be a sergeant in the Metropolitan Police.

He
also secured a £10,000 from Northern Rock and £9,500 from Tesco 
Personal Finance by claiming to be a civil servant in the Met.

The
court was told he also applied for a number of credit cards - from 
Halifax Bank of Scotland and Barclays Bank, again saying he worked for 
the London force.

'Lying had become a way of life for this defendant'

During the
application process for a credit card with Santander, Hillman claimed 
to have been training in Canada with the armed forces and was shortly to
be deployed in Afghanistan.

He
then claimed to be serving in Afghanistan on another credit card form -
asking for correspondence to be forwarded to his 'brother' in Yeovil, 
Somerset.

Hillman emigrated 
to Australia with his family in 2008 but was finally snared after coming
back to Britain to visit his mistress and finalise his divorce in 2009.

The rogue cop initially denied the allegations against him and indicated that he would blame his ex-wife for some of the fraud.

But
he was charged with nine counts of fraud by deception in October 2010 
and finally pleaded guilty after a jury was sworn in for his trial.

Edward
Burgess, defending Hillman, said his client claimed he had 'amnesia' at
the time of the fraud and also had the symptoms of post traumatic 
stress.

He said this stemmed from attending a firearms incident with the force back in 2007.

Mr Burgess said the effect of a prison sentence would be 'devastating' and 'crushing' on the defendant.

As well as the 12 month suspended sentence, Hillman, from St Anne’s Park, Bristol, was handed a 300 hour unpaid work order.

Judge
Hagen said: 'If you received a custodial sentence I think there is a 
very real chance your mental state would deteriorate fairly swiftly.'

Hillman, who resigned from the force when he was charged with fraud, refused to comment when coming out of court.

A confiscation hearing is likely to take place in September to discuss his further repayments.
