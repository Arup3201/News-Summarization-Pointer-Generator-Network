A Native American schoolgirl was suspended from playing in a basketball game as a punishment for speaking in her native language.

Miranda Washinawatok, 12, was told off by her teacher for saying ‘I love you’ in the language used by the Menominee Tribe of Indians and was later banned from playing in the game.

‘She sort of threw her hands down on her desk and said, "Don’t be talking like that. How would you like it if I started talking Polish?"’ Miranda told NBC26.

Teacher: Julie Gurta reportedly asked Miranda, 'How would you like it if I spoke Polish and you didn't understand?'

The teacher, Julie Gurta, and the principal of Shawano Sacred Heart School in Wisconsin have now apologized for Miranda’s benching from the match.

School Principal Dan Minter said he wasn't told the nature of the incident when he made the decision to suspend Miranda from the basketball game.

University of North Dakota teams risk being banned from games if their athletes, cheerleaders or band wear or display the school's Fighting Sioux nickname and American Indian head logo.

'We ask that the university take measures to minimize or eliminate the presence of the imagery or nickname brought to an NCAA championship venue,' Bernard Franklin, an NCAA executive vice president, said in a letter.

The NCAA has long said the nickname and logo are 'hostile' to American Indians, but the mention of forfeiting games is a new development.

‘We knew going in that this was a possibility, but it's in black and white now,’ Brian Faison, the university's athletic director, said.

In March 2011, the North Dakota Legislature approved a law that required the university to use the logo and the Fighting Sioux nickname.

Miranda’s mother, Tanaes, has described the treatment as ‘unfair’ and is lobbying for Julie Gurta to be fired from her post.

'It was unfair treatment I thought,' Tanaes told NBC26. 'It could have been handled differently.'

Tanaes said the school has a majority of Native American children attending, who shouldn’t be restricted with their languages.

'I’m not going to let anybody tell me they can’t speak that language,' said Tanaes.

The Catholic diocese of Green Bay also issued an apology to the entire Menominee nation on Tuesday.

'It is our hope that with greater awareness, we can begin to repair any harm that has been caused, and be able to build new and improved relationships,' said Joseph Bound, director of education for the diocese.

Bound's letter states the diocese recognizes a need for cultural diversity training for students, staff and families at Sacred Heart and plans to create a partnership with Menominee tribal members to implement cultural training at the school in the coming months.

The diocese also plans to invite other cultural groups, including the Menominee, to bring ideas to create cultural awareness and sensitivity to all Catholic schools in the diocese.
