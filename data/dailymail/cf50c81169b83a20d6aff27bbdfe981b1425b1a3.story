Britain’s regime for controlling dangerous paedophiles is fundamentally flawed, a damning police review has concluded.

It leaves thousands of serious sex offenders free to leave the country to abuse youngsters overseas.

There are some 65,000 registered sex offenders in the UK, but only 50 orders stopping such individuals travelling abroad have been obtained in the past five and a half years.

Yet every year the Foreign Office is notified of dozens of alleged paedophiles arrested overseas for child sex offences. There were some 66 such arrests last year.

At the same time, the protection of children in Britain is ‘compromised’ by the system of court orders for child rapists and molesters, the report states.

Only 2,658 Sexual Offender Prevention Orders supposed to control dangerous paedophiles in Britain were imposed in 2011/12.

The review was commissioned by the Association of Chief Police Officers and written by a leading QC, Hugh Davies, and police experts. It found gaping holes in the regime for stopping paedophiles from travelling overseas.

Police can apply for a Foreign Travel Order to keep them in the UK, and anyone on the sex offenders’ register must notify the police if they intend to go abroad.

But the report said the number of such orders was ‘absurdly small’ compared to the number of known sex offenders and ‘even the lowest estimates of extra-territorial offending by identifiable British nationals’.

It added that this ‘tends to demonstrate... that the orders are intrinsically flawed’.

In 2007 not one order was handed down by the courts.

The report said: ‘The UK’s ability effectively to police the conduct of high-risk sex offenders abroad is highly compromised.

‘The irresistible conclusion is that serious sexual offending against children has occurred and is occurring in many jurisdictions in a culture of near impunity.’ The report is also damning about the Sexual Offender Prevention Orders which can be used to put strict controls on a sex offender’s behaviour in Britain.

But police can apply for an order only for someone who already has a conviction for sex crimes, and must show evidence of subsequent threatening behaviour – which is often hard to prove.

The report says the ‘fundamental flaws’ in the orders are ‘serious and in need of immediate remedy’.

It adds: ‘The existing regime simply serves to compromise effective child protection.’ The report was uncovered by Tory backbencher Nicola Blackwood, who today launches a major campaign designed to fix flaws in child protection.

Campaign: Nicola Blackwood MP is seeking to fix flaws in child protection

The Oxford West and Abingdon MP is demanding new laws to protect children in the wake of the Oxford sex ring scandal. Her Childhood Lost campaign is backed by leading children’s charities including Barnardo’s, the NSPCC and Save the Children.

Miss Blackwood is suggesting a new ‘Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Order’ which would consolidate all existing orders into one and be easier for police to obtain.

It would last five years and could be used on someone without a conviction if there was evidence of the danger they pose to children.

Miss Blackwood is also petitioning David Cameron to set up specialist child sexual exploitation centres and for new guidance for judges to ensure tough sentencing in child sexual abuse cases.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Whilst we have some of the toughest powers in the world to deal with sex offenders, we keep them under constant review, and will consider proposals like this.’

Cases which have caused alarm include that of Gary Glitter who was jailed in Britain in 1999 and listed as a sex offender for downloading child abuse pictures.

Despite this he was able to travel to South East Asia. In 2005 he was arrested by the Vietnamese police and convicted of molesting two girls.

At the time critics raised concerns about the apparent ease with which Glitter was able to travel. A Sexual Offender Prevention Order could have restricted his movements, but was not imposed.
