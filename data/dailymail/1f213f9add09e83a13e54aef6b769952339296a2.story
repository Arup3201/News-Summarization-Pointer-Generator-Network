The movie director father of Elliot Rodger, who shot six people dead in Santa Barbara last month, said he initially thought his son was a victim and only discovered the truth when looking online.

Peter Rodger, who worked on the Hunger Games, spoke about his 22-year-old son for the first time in an interview with Barbara Walters, which was aired in full on ABC on Friday.

'I thought he was a victim,' he said. 'It wasn't 
until 4.30, 5am that I found out by going on the internet that he was the
 main suspect and there was only one killer.

'When I saw that, it was like - it's one's worst nightmare. I can't describe the feelings.'

Grief: Director Peter Rodger has given an exclusive interview to ABC about his son, 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, who killed six people before taking his own life in Santa Barbara last month

Breaking his silence: Rodger spoke with ABC's Barbara Walters and said that while he thought his son could be suicidal, he never believed he would have been capable of killing other people

Just hours earlier, he had found out in a Home Depot parking lot that his son had been killed, after he and his ex-wife raced to Santa Barbara after receiving their son's 137-page manifesto.

In the manifesto and in YouTube videos, the younger Rodger had outlined his murderous plans, which he said were 'retribution' for years of girls ignoring him and refusing to have sex with him.

Still, Peter Rodger says he did not think his son was the killer until hours later. After arriving in Santa Barbara, they were met by a sheriff in the parking lot.

'I'll remember this forever the rest of my life,' he said. 'The way [the sheriff] just looked me in the eye, and he said, "We've found a deceased person and we found a license in his pocket that fits your son's description".'

Killer: Elliot killed six people after releasing this video entitled 'Retribution'. He explained in a lengthy manifesto that he was getting back at all the women who had never wanted him

Later that night, after learning that 
his son had been the killer, he was overwhelmed with sorrow for the 
victims of Elliot's crimes.

In the interview, Walters asked Rodger if he wished his son had never been born.

'That's a really loaded question,' he said, pausing. 'A part of me says yes. And the reason is because he did an awful lot of harm to young men and women who didn't deserve to die, and my son did it.'

In the interview, he described how his son changed from a happy boy - 'he would laugh so much that sometimes we were worried he would choke' - to a subdued and anti-social teen with no friends.

Rodger said his son has become obsessed about not having a girlfriend and being a virgin, but when his father offered to take him to Las Vegas 'to do something about it' he declined.

Rodger told Walters he believed his son was jealous of how he looked, and said: 'This is the American horror story. When we have someone who on the outside is one thing and on the inside is something else.'

He added that his son was an 'incredible liar' but said: 'Elliot was far from evil ... Something happened to him. He was the most beautiful, kind, sweetheart of a boy. And something happened to him.'

Now that he is trying to cope with the death of his son and his victims, he said every day is a nightmare.

Scene: Rodger opened fire on students in Isla Vista before plowing into a skateboarder and eventually crashing his black BMW. Police wounded him before he took his life inside the car

'Every night I go to sleep, I wake up 
and think of those young men and women who 
died, who were injured and terrorized. And my son did that,' he said. 
'My son caused so much pain and suffering for so many families.'

Walters asked if the father had any clue that his son was suicidal or even homicidal. 

Rodger replied: 'There
 is no way I thought that this boy could hurt a flea. The most 
unbelievable thing, what I don't get, is that we didn't see this coming 
at all.'

Rodger said he would like improvements made to the mental health system and questioned why, when police do welfare checks, they don't also run a gun check.

'It takes 90 seconds,' Rodger said, adding that if police had performed that check on his son 'it would have thwarted his whole plan'.

Elliot Rodger's mother, Chin, declined to speak to Walters on the show, sending a statement instead saying she believed the focus should be on the victims' families.

The special episode of 20/20 aired
on June 27 at 10pm. It was Walters first return to television since 
retiring on May 16.

While she won't have a regular show 
anymore, Walters will continue contributing to ABC for special projects 
like the interview with Mr Rodger.

Elliot 
Rodger killed six people between the ages of 19 and 22 on May 23 after 
years of what he claimed was rejection and ridicule and sexual jealousy 
because he was a virgin.

The
 bodies of James Hong, David Wang and George Chen were found at a 
beach-side apartment near the University of California, Santa Barbara 
campus.

Rodger also fatally shot three at random - Christopher Martinez, Katherine Breann Cooper andVeronika Elizabeth Weiss.

He
 took his own life after his shooting rampage and it was claimed in the 
days afterwards that his family had tried to get him professional help 
weeks before the massacre.

In the days after the killings, Mr Rodger met up with Richard Martinez, the father of one of the victims, and they were pictured embracing.

The parents of two young men shot dead by Elliot Rodger spoke out this week about losing their sons in a tragedy that they feel could have been prevented.

David Wang, 20, and George Chen, 19, were stabbed to death by their roommate Elliot Rodger, 22, at their beach-side apartment near the UC Santa Barbara Campus on May 23.

Rodger also killed James Hong, Christopher Martinez, Katherine Breann Cooper andVeronika Elizabeth Weiss before taking his own life.

George's mother Kelly Chen broke down as she told CBS: 'We have love in our heart, tears in our eyes, responsibility on our shoulders, and we hear the voice from our children from heaven. We want to do something.'

The devastated parents of David Wang, Charlie and Jane Wang (right) and George Chen, Johnny and Kelly Chen (left) spoke for the first time about their sons who were the joy of their lives. Both young men were killed along with four others by 'virgin killer' Elliot Rodger in May

Kelly Chen and her husband Johnny along with Charlie and Jane Wang believe that there were 'missed opportunities' that could have prevented Rodger's killing spree.

They also expressed their outrage at the media attention focused on the killer and an interview with the victim's father Peter Rodger.

They said that Mr Rodger had not reached out to them to offer his condolences. Following the interview, Mr Rodger sent the families a letter of apology. 

The two families, who both immigrated to the U.S. from China to give their sons' better opportunities, had said they did not want to speak out following their sons' deaths.

However they feel strongly that they must do all they can so no other family would have to endure their pain.

Just a month on from their sons' deaths, the parents said they struggle to cope with the idea that their boys are never coming home. 

Charlie Wang, David's father, said: 'I still think my son is alive and not gone. I still don't understand why this happened to such beautiful heart, beautiful lives.'
