Dramatically, and perhaps decisively, Lewis Hamilton poked the nose of his Mercedes ahead of Nico Rosberg to win the American Grand Prix.

The moment the Briton seized the race – and moved significantly closer to the world title itself – came in the 24th lap at the Circuit of Americas, his run down to the inside of left hairpin at the end of the back straight too brisk and too daring for his team-mate to withstand.

Hamilton’s victory under the Texan sun was his fifth in succession and 32nd of his career – making him, in terms of grand prix wins, the most successful British driver in Formula One history, eclipsing Nigel Mansell, and in 41 fewer races.

But it is not race victories that Hamilton is most avidly chasing but a second world title that would put him behind only Sir Jackie Stewart, who was watching from the paddock in his trademark tartan trews, in the pantheon of our motor racing greats.

Hamilton’s lead over Rosberg, who finished second, is now 24 points. There are 75 still available, with Sao Paulo the next call on Sunday and Abu Dhabi a fortnight later, when points ludicrously count double. So the mathematics says that the contest is far from over, but the psychology says it is.

Rosberg has provided Hamilton a far tougher test than many imagined possible at the start of the season yet ultimately he may have to concede defeat to Hamilton’s one stupendous gift: improbable speed.

Hamilton, starting second, had little chance at the start to sweep past Rosberg, who had claimed pole position so strongly. The pole side of the track here, heading into the giant first corner climb, is a bigger advantage than usual and Rosberg had got away cleanly.

But, as the German admitted afterwards, he was struggling for rhythm. But he still emerged clearly ahead after the first round of pit stops. At that stage his lead was 2.5sec. But Hamilton refused to give up. With his race-stealing move, he made the event worthwhile in front of the American fans he has taken to heart.

‘I was just waiting for the moment to throw it up the inside,’ he said. ‘I was deciding how much of a risk to take. Nico was not defending and I almost caught him unawares.’

At the end he safely picked his way through the backmarkers – even with financially stricken Marussia and Caterham missing there were some – to secure his third victory in America.

Daniel Ricciardo, the rising star of Red Bull, was third in another impressive drive but he never looked like overhauling either of the Mercedes with their superior engines. 

The race itself was balm after the fevered talk of a possible boycott by Lotus, Force India and Sauber to highlight their demands for a greater share of Formula One’s revenues. But, lo and behold, when the last strains of the Star Spangled Banner faded, and the marching band with their sousaphones and assorted brass marched off the grid, every single car took part.

But it took no time for the field to be reduced. Ironically, it was two of the rebels whose cars retired. Sergio Perez had a rush of blood in front of about 10,000 fans who had made the short trip from his homeland of Mexico to cheer him on. He hit the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen from behind and skewed into Adrian Sutil’s Sauber.

Raikkonen’s machine was no more than bruised and he continued. Perez’s car was mangled. Sutil’s was stationary. The safety car was deployed for two laps until bits of broken chassis were cleared.

Force India’s participation ended in the 18th lap when Nico Hulkenberg ground to a halt on the back straight. So they did not need a boycott to sit out most of the race.

As for the boycott threat, it was a farrago that could have walked straight off the pages of Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop. If a correspondent in Ishmalia reported that war had broken out, war broke out. The story begat the event, not vice versa. Here reports of a possible boycott added impetus to a fanciful notion.

Nobody was ever serious about going on strike in the most important marketplace in the sport. But the conspirators loved the spotlight the speculation shone on their complaints so went along with it.

There is talk of a possible resolution between the malcontents and Bernie Ecclestone and the sport’s owners CVC in the next few says. If there is none we could go through the same charade in Brazil next Sunday.

Back to the sharp end of the title fight. Hamilton, who donned a sheriff’s hat after his win, can now afford to finish second in both the final races and claim the title. It is that close.
