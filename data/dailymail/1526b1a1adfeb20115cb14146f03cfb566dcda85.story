A free-running daredevil has filmed his incredible leaps from vertigo-inducing heights using a headcam.

Adrenaline junkie James Kingston gives online viewers an incredible first-person view of his death-defying stunts, filmed from the rooftops of Cambridge.

In one video, the 22-year-old edges along a narrow ledge before leaping across a 14ft gap between two three-storey buildings from a standing start.

Mid-flight: The incredible perspective the videos provide has won Mr Kingston a legion of online fans

He then effortlessly bounds across the tops of other buildings using a free-running technique known as parkour.

The video of his exploits, filmed on a headcam, have already clocked up 140,000 views online.

Last month Mr Kingston had another viral video hit of himself dangling one-handed from a 250ft-tall crane in his native Southampton.

Compared to that, he said, his run across the roofs at Cambridge was 'just another day in the park'.

But his antics have angered Cambridge University who say he was trespassing on many of their buildings.

But James and parkour partner Scott Bass, 21, insist they do no harm and can't understand the people who try to stop them.

James, who started 'free-running' six years ago, said: 'I've got quite a few good friends in Cambridge, and the rooftops there are the best in the whole UK for what I do.

'It had always been in our minds to go there and shoot something, so I finally did.

'As for the jump at the beginning, I didn't even need to prepare because there was no doubt in my mind that I'd make it.

'I've trained hard, so I know what I can do, and for me it's just another jump, just another day in the park.

'I've heard a lot of stories of people training in Cambridge and being stopped. I don't know what makes some people hate free-running so much.

'Perhaps it's because they think we don't know what we're doing and are causing damage.

'Some people can't understand it and therefore are afraid of it and want to get rid of it as soon as they can.

'I'm not reckless, I care about what I'm doing and we're careful not to damage the buildings we're on.'

A spokesman for Cambridge University said James was endangering himself and others.

He said: 'Not only is it trespassing, but endangering public health and their own health.

'We would not encourage the activities from the video in any way.'

He said: 'I wasn't scared. You can't afford to be scared when you're hanging by your fingertips. I did it for the adventure'

James has also completed other hair-raising stunts on tall structures in Los Angeles and Italy.

Last month he played down his stunt with the crane and said he climbed the structure as a way of living life to the full.

He said: 'I wasn't scared. You can't afford to be scared when you're hanging by your fingertips. I did it for the adventure.'

'I didn't go up there to die. I went up there to live.'
