Boris Johnson’s new ‘masterplan’ to become Tory leader was revealed last night as he prepared to use the Eastleigh by-election this week to upstage globetrotting David Cameron.

The London Mayor will take advantage of Mr Cameron’s latest foreign trip – three days in India –  to join the Eastleigh by-election campaign in a bid to revive the flagging Tory vote in the UK.

Rebel Conservative MPs plan to reopen the question of Mr Cameron’s leadership if, as many Tories privately fear, they do badly in Eastleigh, where disgraced former Lib Dem Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne was forced to resign.

'Masterplan': Boris Johnson's hopes to become Tory leader were reveal last night as he prepared to use the Eastleigh by-election this week to upstage globetrotting David Cameron

The latest episode in the lifelong 
rivalry between Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson came as The Mail on Sunday 
learned that the London Mayor’s camp have devised a new plan for him to 
take  control of the Tory Party.

Under their proposal, if Mr Cameron loses the General Election, due in 2015, and resigns, Mr Johnson will allow a ‘caretaker’ leader – possibly Home Secretary Theresa May, chairman Grant Shapps or Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt – to take control and clear up the aftermath of the election defeat.

Mr Johnson hopes to return to the Commons in 2017, ask the ‘caretaker’ to step down and lead the Tories to victory in 2020.

Mr Johnson’s allies say he has ruled 
out plans to return to the Commons before 2015 on the grounds that he 
would be accused of undermining  Mr Cameron.

‘He
 is terrified of falling into the Heseltine trap,’ said a prominent 
Johnson supporter, a reference to Michael Heseltine, whose ambition  to 
succeed Margaret Thatcher was destroyed by claims that he had betrayed 
her.

Lord Heseltine’s plan to force her out succeeded in 1990, but the Tory crown was snatched from his grasp by John Major, who lacked Heseltine’s charisma, but who had stayed loyal  to Maggie.

Mr Johnson’s allies say the only circumstances whereby he would return to Parliament before 2015 would be ‘if we [the Tories] are so far behind in the polls that even Cameron begged him to come back to save them’.

Mr Johnson’s army of Tory fans are hoping Conservatives will turn out in force as he visits Eastleigh on Wednesday to boost his ambition to take over the party.

Mr Cameron will be 5,000 miles away in India, trying to drum up trade with the UK. 

When Mr Johnson visited India last year, he was mobbed in the street by enthusiastic locals and made front-page news in the UK.

If Mr Cameron fails to make a similar impact, while Mr Johnson is mobbed in leafy Eastleigh, comparisons are bound to be drawn between the appeal of the two.

Tory whips have told No  10 that rebel MPs are planning new attacks on  Mr Cameron if the party loses in Eastleigh. ‘With Lib Dem support at a pathetic nine per cent nationally,  if we cannot win Eastleigh – where Labour is non-existent – we are not going to win a General Election,’ said one MP.

The Mail on Sunday disclosed last month how Windsor Tory MP Adam Afriyie, backed by up to 20 Conservative MPs, is planning his own leadership campaign.

Undeterred by widespread derision, allies of ambitious Mr Afriyie are said to have drawn up a ‘Matrix’ which lists all Tory MPs and how  to persuade them to join an anti-Cameron coup.

One MP who claims to have seen the ‘Matrix’ said: ‘It lists every  Tory MP with a grudge against  Cameron, whether they have been sacked or overlooked by him, and any other grievance.’ 

Other sources claim that rebel Tories are making separate plans for a ‘post-Cameron’ leadership  contest by drawing up a list of 250 MPs who would be left if the party is badly beaten in 2015. 

They are using the list to calculate which of the current potential leadership candidates would have most support from a defeated Tory ‘rump’.

Mr Johnson was unavailable for comment last night.

Tony Blair famously heralded the era of ‘cool Britannia’ with a cocktail party for Britpop stars. A few years later, Gordon Brown let slip that he had a penchant for achingly trendy bands Arctic Monkeys and Coldplay.

Now David Cameron has gone one better by allying himself with Britain’s biggest boy band, One Direction, and securing a guest appearance in their latest video.

Looking somewhat overwhelmed – and a little older than the average ‘1D’ fan – the Prime Minister posed on the steps of No 10 with the members of the group – Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne – to publicise their charity single One Way Or Another (Teenage Kicks).

The clip featuring Mr Cameron will form part of the video for the song, a hybrid of 1978 tracks by Blondie and The Undertones, which is the official single for this year’s Comic Relief campaign.

While it is believed to be the first time a serving Prime Minister has appeared in a pop video, Mr Cameron has shown his interest in contemporary music before.

Last October, London Mayor Boris Johnson told the Tory Party conference he had danced to Korean rapper Psy’s single Gangnam Style with Mr Cameron.
