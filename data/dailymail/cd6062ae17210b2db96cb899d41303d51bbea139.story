A 19-year-old Maryland woman who survived being shot by an ex-boyfriend has broken her silence with an emotional Facebook post just two weeks after the attack.

Kristen Loetz first thanks both those who've helped her in her speedy recovery and CJ Abbott, the 19-year-old who died while protecting her from her attacker.

Loetz then compassionately addresses Ryan Shallue, the angry high school flame who took his own life after forcing his way into her home near Salisbury University, shot her in the face, and murdered her heroic friend.

Speaking out: Kristen Loetz (right) took to Facebook to speak for the first time since her jilted ex-boyfriend shot her in the face and murdered her friend who tried to protect her

'Everyone needs to know how you saved my life that day,' writes the honors nursing student in her loving ode to CJ Abbott.

Loetz had spent the 12 days previous recovering from wounds she incurred the night Shallue shot her and Abbott with a semi-automatic rifle before before going into a bathroom and shooting himself in the head.

'My fast recovery is greatly because of all of the love and support I have received from everyone,' Loetz writes.

That support came first and foremost from Abbott, whose sister said he died a hero trying to stop Shallue from assaulting Loetz.

'I love ya ceej': Loetz thanks all her friends and family, but she gives extra thanks to the man who helped her keep her life but lost her own--CJ Abbott

'Thanks for being my hero': Loetz wrote an emotional thanks to CJ Abbott, the 20-year-old who sacrificed himself to help save her life when ex Ryan Shallue pulled out a gun to exact his revenge

'It is so unfair that it was you and not me,' she writes. 'CJ, the most kind gentle hearted person who would jump at the chance to lend a hand to anyone.'

Loetz writes of Abbott's 'fantastic family' and says 'one day I hope to meet them and tell them how amazing of a person I knew you to be.'

'I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for me,' she writes in a post dated September 15.

Loetz goes on to thank the friend named Michelle 'for being so strong during this tragedy' and calling 911 after the shooting.

Then Loetz writes something unexpected, a largely friendly acknowledgement of the ex-boyfriend who tried to kill her.

'You were never a bad person,' she writes of Shallue. 'I hope you have found a better place where you can find peace.'

The 450 word letter closes: 'I love ya ceej, thanks for being my hero.'

Police
 say Ryan Shallue became increasingly disturbed after his high school 
girlfriend Kristen Loetz, 19, dumped him four months ago. Shallue began stalking her and 
bought a gun two weeks before the shooting.

On the night of September 4, he showed up at Loetz's off-campus house, where she 
discovered her with 20-year-old Charles 'CJ' Abbott. When Shallue began 
fighting with Loetz, Abbott tried to intervene, police said.

Shallue pulled out a semi-automatic pistol and pulled the trigger.

Friends: Loetz, left, took to Facebook to thank all her friends. She especially thankful to CJ Abbott, who tried to stop the enraged Shallue when he entered Abbott's home September 4

The Salisbury Daily Times
 reports that Loetz and Shallue graduated high school together in 
Stevensville, Maryland, in 2010. The Facebook profiles for both Loetz 
and Shallue show dozens of photos of them embracing - appearing a happy 
couple at the beach and at prom.

After
 high school, Loetz left and attended Salisbury University, an hour and a
 half away. She became a promising nursing student whom teachers called 
bright and attentive. She joined a sorority on campus and worked at a 
community center for special needs children and teens.

Shallue stayed behind and appears to 
have done little with his life. His Twitter page shows a man becoming 
increasingly bitter and obsessed with alcohol.

Police say Shallue forced his way into his ex-girlfriend's house, just off the campus of Salisbury University on Tuesday night

Police say Loetz dumped Shallue months ago and that he spiraled into obsession and anger.

Shallue's
 Twitter page includes tweets like 'I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare 
me to drive!' and 'I found the cure and its name is vodka!'

Abbott was a skilled car mechanic in Salisbury. His bosses described him as hard-working and dedicated.

His sister told the Daily Times that Abbott and Loetz had been seeing a lot of each other recently.

She
 said her entire family - including his twin brother - are devastated by
 the shocking murder, but said no one was surprised he died trying to 
protect a friend.

'It’s just like CJ to be a hero,' April Abbott told the newspaper.

Police say Shallue became increasingly unstable after Loetz dumped him four months ago. She had moved away from their hometown and was a promising nursing student
