A racehorse owner rammed her Audi into a jockey’s Mercedes late at night, sending it smashing through his front door and causing him to jump naked from his bed.

Sheila Lockhart, 63, who had previously visited a pub, then drove home where she was breath-tested by police – and found to be over the limit.

Mrs Lockhart, a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, was duly found guilty of drink driving and banned for a year by magistrates.

But she has had her conviction overturned after claiming that she had drunk nothing until she arrived home, where she had half a bottle of Prosecco and, to settle her nerves, a ‘homeopathic tonic’ she had bought in Switzerland, not realising it was 15 per cent alcohol.

Appeal: Go Ballistic owner Shelia Lockhart, left, had her conviction for drink driving overturned after a court heard she had driven round to the home of Warren Marston, right, and rammed his car over an alleged breach of confidence

The prosecution at Gloucester Crown 
Court had claimed that Mrs Lockhart rammed Warren Marston’s car because 
she was angry with him for breaking a confidence.

She insisted, however, that she had accidentally put her automatic car into ‘drive’ mode when she meant to reverse.

The court heard that the strange 
incident of the bump in the night took place a year ago at 40-year-old 
Marston’s home in Condicote, near Stow-on-the-Wold.

Mrs Lockhart, whose most famous horse 
is Go Ballistic – which came second in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1999 –
 had a long-standing friendship with the National Hunt jockey.

Marston, who himself retired from racing in April, rode Go Ballistic on its last competitive outing.

Last October, said Mrs Lockhart, she 
was approached by the British Horse Racing Assocation to help with 
‘undercover inquiries’ into a trainer who worked with Marston.

She immediately told the jockey 
because he was a long-standing friend who had gone out with one of her 
daughters and she wanted to keep him out of trouble.

Shortly afterwards, she said, she 
received an ‘abusive and insulting’ call from the trainer under 
investigation. She realised the jockey must have told all to the 
trainer, and set off to see him.

According to prosecutor Simon Emslie, 
she angrily leapt in her car, drove from her home in Cold Aston, near 
Cheltenham, to a pub and then on to Marston’s home to confront him.

According to Mrs Lockhart, she was sober at the time and although she had visited the pub, it was only to look for Marston.

If her speech sounded slurred it was 
because she had taken Mogadon tablets that afternoon. She said: ‘I rang 
the front doorbell and tapped on the windows. I remember banging his car
 and kicking the bonnet, thumping it, in the hope that I would set off 
the alarm and wake him.’

The alarm did not go off so she 
resolved to ‘gently nudge’ his car with hers, she said. She then decided
 to go home – but put her car in the wrong gear.

‘I went into “drive” and walloped his car,’ she said.

‘I could easily have just driven away because there was no sign of anybody but I wouldn’t dream of doing that.

‘I climbed over the damaged door 
frame. Mr Marston was naked at the top of the stairs. He had some very 
fruity words to call me – quite rightly – and told me in no uncertain 
terms to get the hell out of it.’

She said she told Marston she would 
pay for repairs, then drove home. 

She phoned him and was told that 
police had arrived at his home so she invited the officers to come and 
see her. She gave a breath reading of 46 micrograms when the legal limit
 is 35.

Granting her appeal, Judge William 
Hart said: ‘We find that had she been driving when drunk, the last thing
 she would have done would be to invite the police around to see 
evidence of just that.’
