A university boss is under investigation over claims he ‘kissed’ student reps and sexually harassed female staff.

William Taylor, a retired crown court judge, has stepped aside from his role as chairman of Plymouth University while the inquiry goes on.

He has denied any wrongdoing and says that he will ‘robustly defend’ himself against the allegations.

Mr Taylor has been accused of embarrassing colleagues by holding their hands and making smutty remarks – including a lewd comment about one of their cats.

The allegations are said to concern seven women, ranging from recently graduated student representatives to senior staff at the Devon university, whose alumni includes TV wildlife presenter Monty Halls.

According to the BBC, the group claim they were subjected to unwanted touching in the form of kissing or hand-holding for minutes at a time.

They are also said to have complained about lewd jokes or innuendo in conversations.

Three members of staff claim the retired judge joked about a sex act that might be performed on a male colleague, according to the BBC.

And a woman student representative described an occasion at an awards dinner when Mr Taylor, upon seeing a picture of a cat on her mobile phone, made a crude double entendre which she said made her ‘uncomfortable’.

One senior member of staff told the BBC Mr Taylor – who became chairman of the governors in 2012 - was ‘a person who was very comfortable abusing his power’, adding: ‘He was very comfortable making statements that were insinuating sexual commentary. It wasn't a person who was respecting the work that I did at the university. It was a person who decided he wanted to have titillating conversations and didn't care that I was uncomfortable, didn't care that it was unprofessional.’

South West Devon MP Gary Streeter said the scandal was ‘very unfortunate’

Mr Taylor denies the claims, which come amid a bitter internal rift that has seen vice-chancellor Wendy Purcell ‘placed on leave’ in July.

Prof Purcell is believed to have submitted the sexual harassment claims on behalf of herself and other women just before she was suspended from her £288,000-a-year post.

The university has not revealed the reason for Prof Purcell's suspension.

A senior barrister was appointed by the university in August to support its investigation into the first set of allegations against Mr Taylor, which were received by the board in July.

Plymouth University has also come under fire in recent weeks after it emerged management spent £95,000 on seven ceremonial chairs and £24,000 sending six members of staff to a conference in Miami.

South West Devon MP Gary Streeter said the scandal was ‘very unfortunate’. He said: ‘I am in regular contact with the university about this. We all want this matter to be resolved as soon as possible.

‘We need a clearer message from the university that its students are being educated and it is still a good university which we can be proud of.’

Tim Jones, chairman of the Devon and Cornwall Business Council, has accused those involved of ‘washing their dirty linen in public’ and creating a ‘firestorm’.

The clash has prompted the Higher Education Funding Council for England to call for an external, independent review of the university's governance.

Mr Taylor’s lawyers, RPC, said: ‘Save to say that the allegations will be robustly defended, it is not appropriate to comment until that investigation is concluded.’
