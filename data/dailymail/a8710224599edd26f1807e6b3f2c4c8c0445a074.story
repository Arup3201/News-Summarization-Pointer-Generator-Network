Chairman of the company which owned the runaway train that derailed and exploded in a small Quebec town, killing at least 13 people, believes the train may have been tampered with, according to a new report.

'We have evidence of this,' Ed Burkhardt, the president and CEO of the railway's parent company, told the Montreal Gazette on Tuesday. 'But this is an item that needs further investigation. We need to talk to some people we believe to have knowledge of this.'

However Burkhardt said he doesn't 'believe that the event was malicious or an act of terrorism'.

'There are a number of missing pieces here - but we'd like to have a complete idea about the cause.'

Thirteen unidentified victims have been recovered in the town of Lac-Megantic after the Saturday explosion but nearly 40 people are still missing -Â  leading to fears they may have been vaporized in the blast with no remains to be found.

Authorities believe several victims were vaporized in the intense heat of the blaze.

Investigators looking for the cause of a fiery oil train derailment are zeroing in on whether an earlier blaze on the same train may have set off a chain of events that led to the explosions.

Officials were looking at a locomotive blaze on the same train in a nearby town a few hours before the derailment.

Transportation Safety Board investigator Donald Ross said the locomotive's black box has been recovered, and investigators were examining whether the air brakes or the hand brake malfunctioned.

'The extent to which (the fire) played into the sequences of events is a focal point of our investigation,' Ross said.

All but one of the train's 73 cars were carrying oil. At least five of the train's tankers exploded after coming loose early on Saturday, speeding downhill nearly seven miles and derailing into the town of Lac-Megantic, near the Maine border.

Officials said on Tuesday that the fire 
is finally under control and that 1,200 out of about 2,000 evacuees will
be able to go back to their homes.

The search for bodies continued but police declined to update the death toll or take questions about that.

The
rail tankers involved in the derailment are known as DOT-111 and have a
history of puncturing during accidents, the lead Transportation Safety 
Board investigator said on Monday.

Ross said Canada's TSB has gone on 
record saying that it would like to see improvements on these tankers, 
though he said it was too soon to know whether a different or modified 
tanker would have avoided last weekend's tragedy.

The DOT-111 is a staple of the American freight rail fleet. But its flaws have been noted as far back as a 1991 safety study.

Among other things, its steel shell is too thin to resist puncturing in
accidents, which almost guarantees the car will tear open in an 
accident, potentially spilling cargo that could catch fire, explode or 
contaminate the environment.

The train's 72 
oil-filled tanker cars somehow came loose early Saturday morning, sped 
downhill at nearly seven miles into the town, derailed and 
began exploding one by one. At least five exploded.

The eruptions 
sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling through the streets under the 
intense heat of towering fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the 
night sky.

The district is a popular area packed with bars that often 
bustles on summer weekend nights. Police said the first explosion tore 
through the town shortly after 1am local time. Fire then spread to 
several homes.

'I have a friend who was smoking 
outside the bar when it happened, and she barely got away, so we can 
guess what happened to the people inside,' Huot said. 'It's like a 
nightmare. It's the worst thing I can imagine.'

Around
30 buildings were destroyed by the massive blaze, including the 
Musi-Cafe which was packed with revellers when the tankers erupted just 
ten yards away.

'On a 
beautiful evening like this with the bar, there were a lot of people 
there,' said Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant near the blast site. 
'It was a big explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the 
population.'

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was like an atomic bomb. It was very hot. Everybody was afraid.'

About a third of the community of 6,000 was forced out of their homes. The town is about 155 miles (250 kilometers) east of Montreal and just west of the Maine border.

Transportation Safety Board investigator Donald Ross said the black box of the locomotive has been recovered. Edward Burkhardt, the president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic because the engineer had finished his run. The tanker cars somehow came loose.

'We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,' Burkhardt said. 'Well, I think we've blown it here.'
