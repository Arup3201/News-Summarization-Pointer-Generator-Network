She thanked fans for their kind words of congratulations after confirming the pair were engaged.

And last night Melanie Sykes and her new fiancé Jack Cockings couldn't wait to celebrate their happy news and were seen heading out to toast their engagement.

The 42-year-old presenter was seen flashing the diamond ring presented to her by the roofer as the pair went to meet a friend for drinks.

Melanie had opted for a flirty printed white dress for the occasion, which she teamed with a black leather jacket.

Jack, 26, dressed in an extremely tight white T-shirt and grey jeans.

Given that the pair met on the social networking site it was fitting that Melanie Sykes chose Twitter to announce her engagement to a builder 16 years younger than her.

The
42-year-old former model yesterday revealed she will marry her toyboy 
lover Jack Cockings following a four-month whirlwind romance.

Miss Sykes, who is divorced and has two sons, Roman, 10, and Valentino, eight, who suffers from autism, proclaimed:
‘To my beautiful twitter friends just want to let you know that me 
& Jack are engaged to be married and we are very giddy xxx.’

The couple now plan to marry in May next year, according to friends.

An
acquaintance of Mr Cockings claimed the roofer proposed with a ‘small 
diamond ring’ that he bought using a loan from his father.

The happy couple are planning on 
splitting the costs of the wedding equally, with Mr Cockings footing the
bill for the honeymoon which could be in Bora Bora.

Mr
Cockings has told friends he expected the wedding to be inexpensive  as
venues would ‘give things free in return for publicity’.

Cockings, 26, grew up in Dorset and apparently owns his own roofing contracting company.

He has a five-year-old son from a previous relationship.

Miss Sykes is no stranger to brief affairs resulting in marriage proposals - she walked down the aisle with her previous husband actor Daniel Caltagirone - just three months after meeting.

The couple were married for eight years up until their split in 2008.

A close friend said Miss Sykes’s sons got on ‘extremely well’ with Cockings, saying: ‘For Mel, the children are key in everything, they come first and foremost. Especially with Valentino, whom Mel is so protective over.

Excitement: Melanie announced the news on her Twitter page

‘This wedding would not be happening if the boys did not get on with Jack.’

Mr Cockings is believed to have proposed last week by presenting the star with an album of photographs including pictures of him and Miss Sykes and four pages of words about how he felt about her.

On the back page he attached the engagement ring with a ribbon, with the words ‘will you marry me?’.

He told friends that Miss Sykes ‘cried continuously while looking through the album’.

The roofer revealed the details to work mates during a job in Didcot, Oxfordshire.

A friend revealed that Cockings had said of the proposal : ‘I don’t believe in grand gestures, I just wanted it to be just me and her, nice and intimate.’

‘When you know you’ve found the one, you just know. Melanie is my best friend. It’s like hanging around with your mates.’

Mr Cockings first contacted Miss Sykes with flirty messages on the micro-blogging site in April.

He had previously sent messages to Cheryl Cole and former glamour model Jodie Marsh begging them to date go out with him - but they did not respond.

Miss Sykes finally agreed to an actual date with him in May and the pair quickly hit the headlines with their public and graphic flirtation.

In one of the racy posts she tweeted that she had ‘the giddiest knickers of my life’ and told him: ‘I’ve got the raging horn, please take me’.

In another, the star wrote: ‘Jack the rabbit I need some bunny love so hop to it!! Xxx boing boing!!! Loooooool xxxxxxx’.

She was condemned by many for playing out her private life in public.

But she defended herself in a recent interview with the Daily Mail: ‘I don’t even consider the people who follow me on Twitter as fans. They’re friends, my community. It was just giddiness, banter; silly fun.

‘Nothing rude was actually happening, we were in different counties at the time. And I didn’t mean to offend anyone because I’m not an offensive girl. I’m nice! If I did upset anyone, I’m really sorry. I just got a bit carried away.’

She also insisted the 15 year age gap did not bother her.

Miss Sykes explained: ‘Some older men find my independence threatening. Younger men don’t. It’s a generational thing.

‘It’s quite a big ask for a man to be with someone as insanely independent as me, and younger men have the confidence.’

‘My ex-husband was two years younger than me.

‘I’ve always gone out with younger men. They’re more fun and love to have a laugh.’

In the 1990s, she also dated Bros star Matt Goss and actor Max Beesley.
