England fans may be desperate to see Sam Burgess in the centres but Bath head coach Mike Ford believes the star’s future will be as a ‘barn-storming’ back row.

After the former Great Britain and England rugby league player made his debut against Harlequins on Friday night, both Ford and Burgess faced a barrage of questions about the 25-year-old’s future position.

Burgess, who was at Twickenham for England’s win over Australia yesterday, came on in the centres at The Rec on Friday.

While Ford plans to play him in the midfield over the coming weeks, he will eventually be moved into the forwards - despite England’s shortage at No 12.

‘He’ll play his first few games at 12 but we’re going to have a look at him in the back row as well. I think that will suit him more,’ said Ford.

‘He’s a guy who carries a lot and tackles a lot, you can’t stick him out in the centres and let him do nothing because that’s not his skillset.

‘Can he get over the gain-line with six, seven or eight on his back? Course he can.

‘After six or seven weeks we’ll know what his best position is. My vision is for him to be a barn-storming back row.’

Burgess was given 18 minutes of action for Bath but made a limited impact, despite two positive carries and one clear out at the breakdown.

‘I just wanted to touch the ball,’ he said. ‘It’s great to get that monkey off my back and to be part of the team.’
