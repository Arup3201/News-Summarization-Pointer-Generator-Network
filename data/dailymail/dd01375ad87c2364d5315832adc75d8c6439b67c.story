A 32-year-old teacher who is accused of having group sex with a 16-year-old student and her 24-year-old colleague has pleaded not guilty to a separate felony charge relating to the teenager.

Shelley Dufresne, an English teacher at Destrehan High School, allegedly participated in the threesome with the unnamed student and faculty member, Rachel Respess, on September 12.

The married mother-of-three also reportedly had sex with the 11th grade teenager on another occasion at her home in Montz, Louisiana, at some point between August 22 and September 27.

During a 10-minute arraignment on Tuesday afternoon, she entered a not guilty plea via her attorney, Deanne Williams, to a felony count of having carnal knowledge of a juvenile.

Dufresne remains free on $200,000 bond, but will stay under house arrest until her trial. She had no comment as she left the courthouse in Hahnville, according to The Times-Picayune.  

According to prosecutors, Dufresne had an ongoing affair with the student, whom she taught at the high school in Destrehan, a sleepy commuter town west of New Orleans.

The teacher, whose children are aged three, five and seven, was also separately booked on October 1 in Jefferson Parish on suspicion of having group sex with the student and Respess.

The threesome allegedly occurred at Respess's Kenner apartment on September 12, after Dufresne picked up the teen from a Friday Night Lights high school footbal game.

The teachers were caught after the boy told friends that he was sleeping with them, police say. Word soon traveled around the high school campus and school authorities brought in the cops.

Following the incident, both teachers were booked by police on charges of having carnal knowledge of a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile.

The Jefferson Parish district attorney's office is yet to decide whether or when it will file charges against the pair, whose bonds total $7,000, for the alleged threesome. 

Earlier this month, Judge Anne Simon agreed to loosen the rules of Dufresne's house arrest, allowing her to attend a Jazzercise program as part of her treatment for depression.

Under the new rules, the suspect can also play a greater role in helping her husband Wesley care for their three children by taking them to school, doctor's appointments and extra-curricular activities.

Dufresne and Respess remain on unpaid leave from their jobs at Destrehan High School.
