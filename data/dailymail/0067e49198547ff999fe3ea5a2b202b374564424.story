After a string of failed romances, Stefani Germanotta – aka Lady Gaga - is finally engaged to the man of her dreams - Chicago Fire star Taylor Kinney.

What does he have that her other guys didn't? Well, take a look for yourself in these Daily Mail Online exclusive modeling photos taken in 2011.

'When she met Taylor on the set of her 2011 music video, You and I, he was cast as the mad scientist opposite her bizarre mermaid character and by the end of the six minute video – the two were shown getting married. Who would have imagined that scene might actually play out in real life?' says a friend of the couple.

'Stefani never thought she'd find lasting love. But she never stopped hoping it would happen.'

Strike a pose: Taylor Kinney did this modeling session while he was co-staring in The Vampire Diaries. He won his role as Lieutenant Kelly Severide in Chicago fire the following year

We've seen the transformation right before our very eyes. Somewhere under the bizarre outfits, strange makeup and wild wigs there was a style star waiting to emerge and now she has arrived. It looks like finding love and settling down with her hunky hubby-to-be has affected Lady Gaga's taste in fashion and we like what we see.

Back in September the Born This Way singer wore a custom Alexandre Vauthier ensemble to an event for Harper's Bazaar. Draped in a black and white blazer with a plunging neckline and sheer skirt, the neutral palette was pretty tame. But leave it to the newly engaged crooner to spice things up with a thigh-high side slit and fishnet stockings. Sometimes old habits die hard.

Gaga, 28, was instantly attracted to 33-year-old Kinney's dark good looks and blue eyes when they met on location in Nebraska. But she was surprised when he planted an unscripted kiss on her lips during the shoot.

'There was a steamy scene between them, and Taylor just reached over and kissed her,' says the friend. 

'When the director yelled, 'cut,' she asked him why he'd kissed her, since it wasn't part of the script, and he just gave her this sexy smile and walked off. She knew then and there they were going to hook up.

'These two are really in love. And they've found a way to make their relationship work despite the fact he's often stuck in Chicago shooting 'Fire,' and she's out on the road.

'They understand they are on two separate journeys and they allow each other the space to do what they have to do. That way, when they come back together, there are always fireworks.'

According to the friend, the singer was totally taken by Taylor, who plays Lt. Kelly Severide on Chicago Fire.

'Taylor and Gaga are not only lovers, they are best friends,' says the pal. 'He is totally supportive of her career, her bizarre way of dressing and her freaky performances, and she loves the fact he's an adventurer who likes to surf, paddleboard, hike in the mountains, sky dive and ride fast motorcycles. She also appreciates his great sense of humor and she loves how he's super sexy, while still being so sensitive that he cries when she sings love songs.'

Taylor further endeared himself to his lady love in early 2013 when she broke her right hip and suffered a labral tear that required surgery.

'During the six months it took Stefani to recover, he was constantly by her side, pushing her around in the wheel chair and waiting on her hand and foot,' says another source. 'And he encouraged her to heal herself through exercise, yoga and meditation. She also loves the fact he fell in love with Stefani, not her famous Gaga persona.' 

The source says Gaga's parents, Joe and Cindy Germanotta, also adore Taylor. And they are thrilled over their daughter's engagement. 

'Last fall, after three years of togetherness, Joe asked Taylor what his intentions towards his daughter were and the following weekend, Taylor booked a table at her parent's New York restaurant, Joanne Trattoria, and showed them he meant business.'

In front of her folks, and a few close friends, Taylor announced it was his intention to marry Stefani, and that he wanted her parents to know he was serious. Then, on Valentine's Day he returned to the restaurant to purpose.

'Taylor got down on one knee in front of Mr. and Mrs. Germanotta to ask for their daughter's hand in marriage,' says the source. 'Joe and Cindy were thrilled to be part of the proposal and Joe even brought out a few bottles of Dom Perignon Champagne to toast the occasion.'

And a source says the happy couple can't wait to marry and have kids.

'Taylor and Stefani are planning to marry later this year,' says the source. 'And they want to have children right away. They would love to have at least three kids, because they both come from large families.'

Super rich Stefani – who according to Forbes Magazine earned $33 million over the past eight months –  is obviously a real catch for her actor beau.

'But take one look at Taylor and you know right away that Gaga didn't do too badly either when it comes to finding love,' the source added.
