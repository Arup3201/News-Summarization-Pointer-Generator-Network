A teenage girl in a coma after a catastrophic car crash came round just as doctors were about to declare her brain dead.

Carina Melchior had had life support withdrawn on the advice of medics and was being prepared for organ donation.

But to the astonishment of staff at the Aarhus Hospital, in Denmark, the 19-year-old suddenly opened her eyes and started moving her legs.

Miracle: Doctors had turned off the life support machines when Carina Melchior woke up from her coma

She is now making a good recovery at a rehabilitation centre and is able to walk, talk and even ride her horse Mathilde.

Her family is now suing the hospital for damages, claiming that doctors had been desperate to harvest her body parts.

'Those bandits in white coats gave up 
too quickly because they wanted an organ donor,' her father Kim told the
 Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet.

The family’s lawyer Nils Fjeldberg said that Ms Melchior keeps asking if doctors were trying to kill her.

'Of course this is a great trauma, 
both for her and her parents who were convinced that there was nothing 
else that could be done and agreed to donate her organs,' he told the 
newspaper.

Hospitalised: When her brain activity began to fade, doctors believed there was very little chance of survival, and if she ever was to recover, she would be in a persistent vegetative state

Ms Melchior, now 20, crashed her car in October last year.

She was in hospital for three days 
before doctors realised her brain activity was fading and consulted her 
family about stopping treatment.

It was at this point they agreed to donate her organs.

In a documentary about her life called
 'The girl who wouldn't die', Carina says she is convinced she will 
recover and that hopes to move in to her own flat in the future.

‘And I will be working as a graphic designer and be able to ride Mathilde properly,’ she said.

No hope: After speaking to her parents it was decided that the apparatus which kept her breathing was to be turned off and organ donation was prepared

Awake: The family had already said goodbye when the hospital called and said Carina had opened her eyes

The case has sparked a public debate 
in Denmark about donations and end-of-life treatments, with registered 
donors withdrawing consent in fear of doctors acting too quickly.

The Danish government is drawing up 
new guidelines to prevent doctors from making preparations to remove 
organs until the patient is officially declared clinically dead.

However, medical experts say the 
preparations made before a patient is declared brain dead are vital to 
ensure that correct matches are made between organ donors and receivers.

One Danish doctor who spoke to 
MailOnline said it was an unfortunate case of miscommunication between 
Carina’s family and the doctors at Aarhus.

‘The story says a lot about the 
importance of communication in a doctor-patient relationship,’ the 
doctor said. ‘If the doctors had expressed themselves differently, the 
parents would not have felt so maltreated.’

‘From a medical point of view, no mistakes have been made. The girl was never declared brain-dead, that was never the case.

'In fact, the doctors saved her life 
with the treatment they gave her.

'And they were not going to ‘take’ her
 organs, it was merely a conversation about organ donation if she would 
become brain dead.’

The doctors at Aarhus hospital has 
apologised for the failures in communication during Carina's treatment 
and have said they made a mistake.
