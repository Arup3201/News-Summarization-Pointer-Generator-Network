She was cast as the 14-year-old daughter of Sarah Platt in Coronation Street after producers were tricked into believing she was 19-years-old.

But it has emerged that actress Katie Redford is 25 – making her 11 years older than her character and just two years younger than her on-screen mother, played by Tina O'Brien. 

The actress has now been fired and ITV is re-casting the role of 'tearaway teenager' Bethany who will be arriving unannounced in Weatherfield from her home in Milan in the spring.

Soap fans unearthed a variety of evidence which reveals the actress's real age after ITV announced that  'Nottingham-born Katie, 19' would be playing the young character.

A former online CV for the actress listed her date of birth as 2 March 1989 and her Twitter username has changed from 'katieredford89' to 'Katieredfordtlc'.

Public records also show that Ms Redford's date of birth is 2 March 1989 - meaning she would be 12 years older than the character in two months time.

Fan Dave Harrison said: 'On her Twitter account there were pictures of the actress at her 25th birthday last year.'

Cal tweeted: 'Why are all the press releases for the new Bethany casting saying Katie Redford is 19? She's 25 as she was born in 1989. #Corrie'

Megan said: 'It's hilarious how ITV are desperately trying to remove all traces of Katie Redford's real age from the internet.'

The actress's agent Jo McLintock revealed that ITV was not aware of her age and said Ms Redford was 'understandably' upset today.

She said: 'Katie went in there acting as a young actress with a playing age of 16-20. ITV did not know her age. We were at fault as we let her go in there without the producers knowing her age.

'She is being re-cast and casting was adamant that they would not be using us again unfortunately.

'She is a brilliant young actress and very talented. We ill-advised her, but she just went in there and acted much younger than her age.

'Understandably she is very upset today.'

Ms Redford trained with The National Youth Theatre and was nominated for Best Actress in award winning film, Pitfall at The Underwire Film Festival. 

The character Bethany was last seen in 2007 when she moved to Italy with her mother who had landed a job working for Gail Platt's half brother Stephen Reid in Milan.

She was previously played by three child actors - Mia Cookson and twins Amy and Emily Walton.

Producer Stuart Blackburn said: 'Full of mischief and with a real lust for life Bethany is an unpredictable force of nature who will bring joy and chaos in equal measure, turning their household upside down.

'Life has just got a lot more interesting for The Platts and anyone who crosses Bethany's path.' 

A spokesman for ITV said: 'Coronation Street have taken the decision to recast the part of Bethany Platt.' 

It is thought that the programme already has someone in mind for the role.
