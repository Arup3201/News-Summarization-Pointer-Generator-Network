Ronny Deila knows his success at Celtic will be gauged on silverware. On his ability to deliver Champions League football and domestic dominance on an annual, undisturbed, basis.

And yet for this educated, single-minded Norwegian, the cups and trophies are not his prime motivation. They are not his raison d’etre.

Dermot Desmond, Peter Lawwell and Celtic supporters may feel differently, but for Deila it’s about the experiences. The sensations. Here is an idealist who wants to manage Celtic in Europe and feel goosebumps on his arms.

New challenge: Ronny Deila is looking ahead to a new challenge with Scottish giants Celtic

Vision: Deila wants Celtic to make a mark on European football playing the right way

‘My dream with Celtic is to go to Celtic Park for a Champions League match, play a really big European team and control the game. I want to have more passes than the opposition and really just blow them away. That’s my dream,’ he said.

‘For me, it is about moments. Trophies are important, but I don’t remember the trophies I won in Norway.

‘I remember the moments - driving to the stadium, seeing the people happy. Playing fantastic football to win the game and the young kids are smiling - I get goosebumps from that.

‘When I came to watch Celtic play Barcelona at home last season, it was unbelievable. Think what it would be like if Celtic could also control the game? That would be awesome, fantastic - and that’s my dream.’

All of this is well and good. But the truth is this. Ronny Deila will only hang around to sample these moments as a Celtic manager if he wins games. If he consistently delivers trophies and Champions League qualification.

He takes a major step towards that goal in Poland this evening. Celtic arrived in Warsaw, the country’s capital city, to soaring temperatures of 31 degrees centigrade. The tar may not be melting on the streets, but a certain degree of expectation is bubbling under the surface here.

Excited: Deila is relishing the opportunity to take Celtic to the next level

All ears: Celtic players listen to a team talk from Deila during a pre-season friendly

Scotland’s champions are marginal favourites. Yet Legia Warsaw fancy their chances of an upset. Even if no Polish team has competed in the Champions League group stage for 17 years.

In this old city, they speak freely of Celtic being weaker than they used to be. Former Parkhead striker Maciej Zurawski claims his old team are nowhere near the calibre of line-up he performed in under Gordon Strachan.

There can’t be many who recall Dion Dublin or Paul Telfer being world beaters, but Zurawki has given rise to a common view in Poland.

Under Henning Berg, Legia Warsaw are no great shakes themselves. But their confidence is pinned on a growing conviction that the same might be said of Celtic.

‘We are meeting a team who could fight for playing in the Champions League group stages,’ acknowledged Deila. ‘They have a goal to do this and they are capable.

‘I think we are going to have two very close games and small details are going to prove the difference, as it did last year for Celtic and the year before. They had some very close matches.’ Deila, a coach with precious little real experience at this level, declared himself ‘comfortable’ with his team’s chances.

Yet there are plenty of observers – and they are not all Polish - who suspect that this Celtic team lack the depth and quality to reach the group stages for a third successive year.

Gary Hooper, Victor Wanyama, Kelvin Wilson, Joe Ledley and Georgios Samaras have gone, while captain Scott Brown is injured.

Fraser Forster and Virgil van Dijk have not departerd yet, but the only new faces are Craig Gordon - a goalkeeper who hasn’t played a competitive game for two years - and Jo Inge Berget, a Cardiff City loan signing who has barely kicked a ball in six months.

Unfazed, however, Deila said: ‘I have seen my players for a month now and I’ve seen the quality in the squad. So, if we can manage to get the best out of them for this match then I know we have a very good chance to beat Legia.

Confident: Deila will back himself to do well in the Parkhead hotseat

‘Of course we want a good result here and if we win then it’s a good result. But it’s not easy to win away from home and I know at their own ground they will attack us very hard.

‘The players have to prepare, have to know what they are going to meet and how we’re going to go into the game.

‘If we do that well, I see in the squad we have a lot of good football players.’

On the persistent suggestions from current and former Legia players that Celtic are no longer the team they were at this level, Deila is dismissive.

‘Maybe there is a bit of disrespect. But they can say a lot of things,’ he said. ‘I think how we are feeling is much more important than how the others are thinking.’

The arrival of attacker Berget strengthens Deila’s options. Yet it’s hard to see how the new man can be fit or sharp enough to make a positive contribution to a team in need of first-choice, quality signings.

As he must, Berget believes he can make a positive difference to the squad and claims he can play some role against Legia and his former Lyn coach Henning Berg.

‘I’m not expecting to go right in and start,’ said the 23-year-old Norwegian international, ‘but if I get the chance then I can tell the coach that I’m ready and I’m going to take it.

‘It’s not bad to maybe get a debut in the Champions League qualification, so I hope I can make a contribution.

Competitive: Deila wants to make Celtic a force to be reckoned with in Europe

‘I am match fit. I haven’t played many first-team games for Cardiff, but many for the second team and I played three or four national games during that time. I also played pre-season, so I feel fit.’ 

Deila knows Berget well after taking him on loan from Udinese for 18 months while coach of Stromsgodset.

Neither is Legia coach Berg a stranger to his abilities.

‘Henning was my coach at Lyn and we were together for some years,’ explained Berget. ‘When I first started up at 15 he was my first coach and introduced me to senior football.

‘He played a big part in my development so it will be fun with the two coaches involved tomorrow night.

‘Playing under Ronny was kind of where I made my breakthrough. I owe him a lot - and I hope I can repay him here.’
