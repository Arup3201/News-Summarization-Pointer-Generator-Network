Plans by the University of London to sell four of Shakespeare's folios at auction, including a rare first edition, have been described by an expert as 'stupidity of the highest order'.

Academics fear if the sale goes ahead, the manuscripts, all of which were printed in the 17th century, will be snapped up by a private collector and will be moved overseas.

Only 232 of the first press, which dates back to 1623, are believed to have survived intact. It contains the famous engraving of the Bard by Martin Droeshout.

Rare: An example of the First Folio, printed in 1623. This edition contained the famous picture of the Bard, by Martin Droeshout

The university hopes to raise about £5million when the folios go up for sale at auction house Bonhams, in November.

The books were bequeathed to the university's Senate House Library by American philanthropist, Sir Louis Sterling, when he died in 1958, on the condition they were not sold later.

Because the library holds two copies of the first folio, which is regarded as being the most reliable, director Christopher Pressler told The Times one could be sold because they are 'essentially duplicaties'.

The claims drew derision from Shakespeare expert and visiting professor at University College London, Sir Brian Vickers.

He described it as 'rubbish', and pointed out no two books were the same because printing practices in the 17th century meant that every time a page was printed, the press would be stopped and corrections made.

Strong words: A detail of Hamlet's famous soliloquy from the 1623 First Folio edition of Shakespeare's plays. The book contains 36 plays, 18 of which had not been seen before

Historic: Shakespeare's were not printed in their entirety until 1623. Before then they had not been considered worthy enough

He added: 'One of these copies may contain a correction that has puzzled people for many years and has never been solved.

'So to sell them is an act of stupidity of the highest order.'

The majority of the first folios have already moved overseas and in a letter to Mr Pressler, Professor Henry Woudhuysen, rector of Lincoln College at the University of Oxford, warned Senate House would harm its reputation if it went ahead with the sale.

He wrote: 'It will, I fear, make many
who are supporters of the library and possible donors to it turn their 
charitable interests elsewhere.

'The rationale for the sale is muddled and prompts questions about the current management of the collections.'

The Bard: An early portrait of the English poet and playright, whose works are being put up for sale by the University of London to the horror of experts

Lecturer in Shakespeare at the University of Nottingham and trustee of the British Shakespeare Association, Dr Peter Kirwin, said: 'It's deeply surprising that the library would sell books of this nature when they have been bequeathed as a permanent gift.

'My view is that the key issue here is these books were intended as a permanent gift to the university's library, and any sale could move the books to a private collection.

'Not being made available to the public is a really serious matter.'

Senate House plans to use the money raised through the sale to add to its collection by buying manuscripts from the 20th and 21st century, a plan described by Prof Woudhuysen as a 'gamble'.

He said: 'The sale would leave the library as Hamlet without the prince.'

In his view the most likely fate for the rare editions would a 'very rich, private individual' would make a move for them.

A consultation on the plan began last week and the manuscripts are set to leave the country this month for a tour of cities in the US.
