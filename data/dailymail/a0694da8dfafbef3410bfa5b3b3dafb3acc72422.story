Kevin Pietersen fired another shot
 in his verbal battle with Matt Prior on Friday when he hit back over 
the wicketkeeper’s claim that the England dressing room will be a 
better place without him.

Prior,
 whose relationship with Pietersen deteriorated badly towards the end of
 the Ashes, became the first player to publicly express his feelings 
over the maverick’s sacking when he spoke at a question-and-answer 
session in Dubai about the need to ‘rediscover the honour and pride of 
playing for England’.

Pietersen responded on Twitter when he referred to Prior as the ‘Big Cheese’, a nickname given to him in his early days at Sussex, and mocked the Ashes vice-captain’s demotion from the team for the last two Tests in Australia.

‘Fewer Q&As, more Sussex nets methinks,’ said Pietersen, who had earlier revealed details of Prior’s leading role in a team meeting after the Melbourne Test through his mouthpiece Piers Morgan.

Then Pietersen, who name-checked Jos Buttler, Prior’s rival for a Test place this summer, responded to a follower’s tweet which said, ‘This is why KP isn’t in the England team any more’, by saying, ‘Neither is the Big Cheese Prior’.

It is a tiresome extension of a row that does little credit to anyone but it is further evidence Pietersen will be lurking in the background to provide a distraction to England’s attempts to move on without him.

That new era continued without Pietersen 
here with a slightly shambolic start to the first of three 
one-day internationals when Paul Collingwood was promoted from his role 
as temporary coach to be 12th man.

England had been hit by  injuries 
to Eoin Morgan and Alex Hales, bringing one-day international debuts for
 Moeen Ali and Michael Lumb and also the  need for an extra substitute 
to complete the complement of four demanded by the ICC.

Collingwood, 
who retired from international cricket three years ago, is still active 
with Durham and was considered a better bet than fast bowlers Jade 
Dernbach and Harry Gurney should a second sub, in addition to Steven 
Parry, have been required.

Yet the ICC, never short of a petty rule, 
would not let him take the field wearing another player’s shirt so Phil 
Neale, the England operations manager, was deputed to head into the 
stands to borrow one from a fan, Dave Whelan from Devon.

Whelan was 
wearing the shirt, a Christmas present from his wife, for the first time
 but said he was happy to help out England while Neale promised he would
 get it signed by the team once Collingwood had finished with it.

Back
 on the pitch, where Collingwood was not required, there was early 
encouragement for an England side who are using this series to prepare 
for the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. The low, slow pitch at a stadium 
where an unfit outfield forced the abandonment of a Test in 2009 
encouraged stand-in captain Stuart Broad to use three off-spinners in 
the first 15 overs of the West Indies innings.

Replacing Graeme 
Swann, who was sitting in the stands in his new role as a BBC radio 
summariser and calling Pietersen’s response to Prior ‘fairly childish’, 
is arguably England’s most pressing need.So Broad gave the new ball 
to Joe Root after England had won the toss and he took the first West 
Indian wicket, thanks to a stunning, one-handed catch from Barbados-born
 Chris Jordan.

There was a tidy contribution from James Tredwell, who
 conceded only 23 runs from his 10 overs, and an encouraging start from 
Moeen, principally a batsman with Worcestershire but clearly no mean 
spinner, too.

Moeen trapped Darren Bravo lbw and held the catch in 
an improved England fielding  performance which ended the resistance of 
Lendl Simmons, who initially held a stuttering West Indies together with
 65.

Yet Broad’s faith in spin backfired when he gave Root the 47th 
over and saw it go for 23 as Darren Sammy and Dwayne Bravo gave the home
 side late impetus with some spectacular hitting to take them to a 
competitive 269 for six. The last 10 overs brought 116.

That gave 
England food for thought during an interval when the Antiguan government
 honoured the island’s glorious cricketing past by knighting Richie 
Richardson, Curtly Ambrose and Andy Roberts.
