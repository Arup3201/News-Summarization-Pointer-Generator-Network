British warplanes have begun a 'walls of Jericho' strategy to destroy Colonel Gaddafi's homes and finally end his regime.

Hopes that the dictator's days are numbered grew yesterday when Libya's interior minister abandoned the Gaddafi clan.

In the most high profile defection since foreign minister Musa Kusa fled to Britain earlier this year, Nassr al-Mabrouk Abdullah flew to Egypt on his private plane with nine family members.

With rebel forces yesterday  closing 
to within 30 miles of the dictator's Tripoli stronghold, defence sources
revealed that Tornado bombers and unmanned drones are knocking out the 
walls of his presidential compounds and homes.

Intelligence analysts believe that 
visibly destroying the barriers Gaddafi has hidden behind for four 
decades will encourage a coup.

The known addresses and headquarters of Gaddafi's 10 closest aides have also been targeted to drive him from power.

A senior defence source told the Mail 
that the plan was based on the Biblical story of the walls of Jericho, 
where an invading army wins the day by forcing the city walls to 
collapse.

'We are literally making Gaddafi's walls come tumbling down,' the source said.

A second MoD source said: 'There are 
about 10 people around Gaddafi who matter. We are targeting them too. 
They know we can get  at them. It makes them think,  “Why am I sticking 
with this guy?”'

Muammar Gaddafi today urged his supporters to 'get ready to fight' as the rebels began to strangle the Libyan capital of Tripoli by halting food and fuel supplies from Tunisia. Meanwhile his deputy minister of security, Nasser al-Mabrouk Abdullah (right) has reportedly fled to Cairo with his family

Gaddafi is not thought to be hiding in a palace but in 
an underground bunker. Intelligence reports have also suggested that he 
moves between hospitals at night to avoid being bombed by Nato 
warplanes.

In a barely audible telephone call to 
state television overnight, a defiant Gaddafi called on his followers to
fight rebels he called 'rats'.

But the rebel forces' advance was 
raising fears among residents that fighting might soon reach there. 

Cars carrying fleeing civilians crossed checkpoints on a desert road 
near the key coastal town of Zawiya, headed for the rebel-held western 
mountains.

'We are afraid of whatever is coming,' said Mohammed 
Bilkheir, an accountant who was with his family.

Gaddafi's forces fired mortars  and 
rockets yesterday in a crucial battle for Zawiya where rebels  captured 
the town centre at the weekend.

Rebels said they captured the town of 
Garyan, south of Tripoli yesterday.

A UN envoy arrived in neighbouring 
Tunisia yesterday as behind-the-scenes talks began about  Libya's 
political future, further fuelling speculation that the bloody conflict 
could be ending.

Gaddafi's government denies talks with rebels are taking place.
