A woman prison officer was found naked in bed with a convict dubbed 'one of the most feared men in Scotland' after helping him abscond from jail, a court heard.

Police hunting escaped convict James Holland burst into Christine Robertson's flat and found the couple in bed together, after she had allegedly helped the notorious thug flee prison.

Robertson, 45, was found in the compromising position after previously 'appointing herself' as Holland's 'personal officer', it is alleged.

Relationship: Christine Robertson, pictured arriving at court today, was discovered naked in bed with violent career criminal James Holland (right) in March last year, a court heard

She had aided and abetted career criminal Holland in helping him abscond from Castle Huntly open jail in Perthshire, a jury at Dundee Sheriff Court heard today.

Violent Holland, who had spent the last 20 years in jail for various crimes, absonded prison on March 16 last year while serving an eight-year term for assault and robbery.

He was described as 'one of the most feared and dangerous men in Scotland' today, but amazingly had been kept in open prison conditions before absconding last year.

The court heard that when riot police raided Robertson's flat in Angus, near Dundee on March 17 last year and found her naked in bed with Holland, she told an officer: 'That's my job f****d', before giggling.

Police had broken down the door of Robertson's flat after receiving intelligence she was there with Holland, before having to Taser the wanted prisoner when he waved a large kitchen knife at officers.

The trial was told that Holland had been moved to Castle Huntly open prison from Saughton in Edinburgh after being deemed 'low risk', despite his track record of violence.

Prison officer Graham Tait told the court he was later moved back to Saughton in October due to 'behavioural issues'.

Fled: Robertson is accused of aiding and abetting Holland after he absconded from Castle Huntly open prison near Dundee last year

Violent: Career criminal Holland, who has spent 20 years in jail, was moved from Saughton prison near Edinburgh due to 'behavioural issues' but was later taken to an open prison despite his criminal past

But despite that Holland was again moved back to open conditions - first at Noranside in Angus and then again at Castle Huntly just weeks later.

Fiscal depute Douglas Wiseman asked Mr Tait: 'Were you aware that Christine Robertson had changed the prison records to make herself James Holland's personal officer?

He replied: 'I heard that after the fact.'

Mr Wiseman asked: 'She made herself personal officer?'

Mr Tait replied: 'Yes.'

Mr Wiseman asked: 'She wasn't appointed to that post - she self appointed herself to that post?'

Mr Tait: 'I believe that is the case.'

Mr Tait also told the court that Robertson’s role as Holland’s personal prison officer at Castle Huntly began when she conducted an interview with him when he entered the jail.

The court earlier heard that personal officers act as an 'advocate' for prisoners - and accompany prisoners on escorted leave from jail.

The trial was earlier told that Holland and Robertson had left the jail together on one occasion for a day out to Crail and Anstruther in Fife - visiting a chip shop.

Trial: A jury at Dundee Sheriff Court heard Robertson said to an officer when she was caught in bed with Holland: 'That's my job f****d'

On another occasion she accompanied him to visit a social worker in Glasgow.

The trial has already heard how police received intelligence that Holland was at Robertson's Angus flat - before breaking down her door in a planned operation to locate him.

When they burst in they found Holland and Robertson naked together in her bed.

Holland then had to be blasted with a Taser stun gun to subdue him as he waved a knife at officers.

Robertson, 45, Monifieth, Angus, denies aiding and abetting James Holland in absconding and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.

The trial continues.
