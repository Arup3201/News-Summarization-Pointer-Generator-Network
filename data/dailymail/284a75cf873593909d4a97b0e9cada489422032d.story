Singapore Airlines is spending £200million fitting out their fleet of aircraft with new deckchair-style seats.

The airline is embarking on a major revamp of its 19 Boeing 777 planes.

The changes will include equipping the aircraft with seats that feature two new settings - ‘Sundeck’ and ‘Lazy Z’.

Singapore Airlines' first class seats will be as long as 82 inches and as wide as 35 inches in first class

New, bigger seats will also be added to the airline’s first class cabins.

The seats will be as long as 82 inches and as wide as 35 inches in first class following the move.

Television screens will be expanded to 24 inches in first class and 18 inches in business class.

Economy class customers will also get bigger seats and screens.

The revamp of the existing Boeing 777 planes starts early next year and is projected to be completed in 2016

Singapore Airlines has three newer 777s that have already been fitted with the larger seats and screens on routes to cities such as London and Tokyo.

The revamp of the existing Boeing 777 planes starts early next year and is projected to be completed in September 2016, said Nicholas Ionides, the airline’s spokesman.

The investment comes after Emirates Airways, and Etihad Airways both unveiled a raft of luxury offerings, including showers and butlers on their flights to the Middle East.

‘A revamp prevents defection to other carriers,’ said Timothy Ross, the head of Asia-Pacific transport research at Credit Suisse Group AG in Singapore.

Singapore Airlines, which is Asia’s third-biggest carrier, is also spending around £50million to upgrade its airport lounges over five years, with the first one completed in Sydney last December.

It was earlier this year that a Singapore Airlines executive said the launch of the New Generation Cabins were being introduced as a way of thanking passengers for continued patronage of the airline.

Sinapore Airlines are revamping their cabins after Qantas Airways, and Etihad Airways both recently unveiled a raft of luxury offerings, including showers and butlers on their flights to the Middle East

SIA regional vice president for Southeast Asia Philip Goh said: ‘Singapore Airlines is committed to make air travel more comfortable and hassle-free, and we have been investing heavily in new aircraft, seat and cabin products and services.’

Goh said the new seats would also be fitted on the new A350 aircraft joining their fleet by next year.

According to Goh, the seats are a result of more than two years of effort, a design collaboration with world-renowned design companies like BMW Design-works USA and James Park Associates of the UK.

Goh said the B777-300 aircraft fitted with the new seats are now in service on their flights to London.
