A huge fire has brought to end a mock Mars mission being held in the middle of the Utah desert.

The mission involved four 'astronauts' living in isolation for two weeks in the hope of recreating the psychological effects of life on Mars.

But instead, they were dealt with a real-life emergency when an accidental fire destroyed part of the Mars Desert Research Station, with flames reaching 10ft (3 metres) high.

The Mars Society, who runs the missions, said that no one was hurt among the crew who attempted to battle the flames on their own for over an hour.

According to Space.com, crew Commander Nick Orenstein, spotted smoke billowing from the greenhouse and ran outside to take a look.

'This is a moment where instinct took over, the instinct of fight or flight, and we had fight,' Orenstein told Space.com. 'There really wasn't a question at the moment.'

The middle of the greenhouse, which was called the GreenHab, was destroyed and an investigation found that an electrical heater placed too close to shelves caused the flames.

Orenstein's crew stayed in Hanksville, four miles from the habitat, and commuted back and forth to MDRS and coordinated with emergency officials before deciding to end the simulation on December 31.

The GreenHab that was destroyed was the second greenhouse built at MDRS, after the first one collapsed under heavy winds.

'The GreenHab fire was very unfortunate, and the crew that bravely dealt with the incident ended their simulation early,' Michael Stoltz, the Mars Society's Director of Media told MailOnline.

During their stay, the astronaut's home is the Habitat Module, a two storey silo-shaped building with lab areas and living spaces, eight metres in diameter

'But the Mars Desert Research Station is up and running, albeit temporarily without greenhouse experiments, which is just one aspect of the important research being done at the facility. 

'Another crew arrived at the Utah station a week or so after the fire to begin their two week Mars field simulation. We're back to preparing for Mars exploration and settlement.'

A volunteer for the mock mission, Elizabeth Howell, had previously told MailOnline that the mission can be overwhelming.

'When I was in a spacesuit I felt like I was in an outside world,' she said. 'It makes you think and behave differently.'

The Mars Society said they will aim to have a replacement structure ready in time for next batch of 'astronauts' to live at the Utah station

sending a manned mission to Mars is 'necessary if the human race is to survive', Nasa chiefs have said. 

Speaking at the Humans to Mars summit in Washington, head of the US space programme Charles Bolden, said last year: 'If this species is to survive indefinitely we need to become a multi-planet species, we need to go to Mars, and Mars is a stepping stone to other solar systems.'

Mr Bolden revealed plans for the series of 'stepping stones' to the red planet, which included 'lassoing' an asteroid.It also included growing plants in space, and using 3D printers for onboard repairs.

Nasa plans to capture an asteroid by 2015 and take it into the moon's orbit, send a spaceship to it and collect samples before returning home in less than a month round trip. 

The experiments being conducted in Utah and a sister station in the Arctic are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a trip

Leaving the Habitat Module requires a request to Mission Support a day in advance.

Even then, they have to put on an unwieldy spacesuit. The suits worn by the scientists come with their own air-conditioning, radio units, heavy helmets, and boots.

Contact with the outside world is strictly limited, with a very slow internet connection restricted to allow just a few emails in and out each day.

Most communication is with 'mission control', who asked the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two-week shifts. That includes details on their food intake, exercise, and psychological status.

The shortest possible journey to Mars is 140 million miles, a trip that is thought to take around seven months.
