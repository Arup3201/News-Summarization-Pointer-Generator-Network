Pets do like to be pampered, we know. But these particular treats are almost certainly designed for the owner’s benefit.

Some 55 per cent of animal lovers will give their pets a Christmas stocking, while 25 per cent give them an advent calendar.

Eighteen per cent will spend more on their cat, dog or gerbil than on their mother-in-law.

Nearly one in five pet mad Britons spend more on their pet than their mother-in-law

Most owners (53 per cent) spend more on their pet than on their colleague

An RSPCA poll of almost 900 pet 
owners revealed that 91 per cent will buy their furry friends a present 
this year, spending a total of £300million.

While 54 per cent will spend up to £10 on their pet, a dedicated 3 per cent will fork out more than £50.

And
 it’s not just mothers-in-law who may feel left out. Some 53 per cent of
 animal lovers will buy their pet a more expensive gift than for a 
colleague, and 7 per cent will lavish more on Fido or Tiddles than on 
their partner.

Incredibly, 3 per cent said they would buy more presents for their pet than for their child.

There are an estimated 18million cats, dogs and rabbits in the UK and the charity says owners are expected to clock up an estimated £300million on gifts for their furry friends.

Extravagant gifts seem to becoming increasingly the norm for pet-mad Brits with a quarter of pets (26 per cent) now having an advent calendar.

Darren Parrish, manager of the RSPCA South Godstone Animal Centre in Surrey, said: 'It's lovely to hear that a vast majority of pet owners consider them to be part of the family and really include them in the Christmas celebrations.

'It goes to show we really are nation of animal lovers with nine out ten owners buying their pet a pressie, a quarter having an advent calendar and more than half having a Christmas stocking.

'It's amazing that animals lovers will be spending about £300 million  on their pets this year - that would pay for Christmas dinner for our animals until the next millennium.'
