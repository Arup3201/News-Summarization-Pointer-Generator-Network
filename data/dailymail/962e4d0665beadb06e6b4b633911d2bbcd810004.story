A middle school history teacher who was suspended after teaching students about the use of blackface in entertainment during the 1800s has been allowed back into the classroom after a protest by parents and pupils.

Alan Barron, 59, from Monroe, Michigan, was placed on paid administrative leave two weeks ago after an assistant principal at Monroe Middle School sat in on Barron's lesson about Jim Crow racial segregation laws.

As part of the lesson, Barron showed the class a video about the use of blackface by white performers of the time to imitate African Americans.

The administrator objected to the video, and Barron, a teacher for 36 years in Monroe, was suspended just weeks shy of his retirement.

Back in play: Residents of Monroe, Michigan protested a decision by the school board to suspend history teacher Alan Barron after teaching a lesson about the use of blackface

Alan Barron, 59, was suspended two weeks ago for showing his class a video about the use of blackface in the entertainment of the 1800s

'I have no words that can express my gratitude and thanks for the support you have shown toward me during this turbulent time of my career,' Mr. Barron said on his Facebook page.

'Each day I preach to my students far more than history. I preach about choices, commitment and community service as I try to practice what I teach.'

Parents and students were outraged at Mr Barron's suspension with almost everyone defending his character as well as his choice of lesson plan.

'She was more offended that they stopped the video,' Adrienne Aaron, mother to one of the students in the classroom said about her daughter's reaction to seeing the video.

'It had nothing to do with racism.' said Mrs Aaron, whose husband is African American. 'History is history. We need to educate our kids to see how far we’ve come in America. How is that racism?'

Many other students and parents took to Facebook to voice their dissatisfaction over Barron's suspension and it appears their voices have been heard.

'We want you back Mr. Barron' wrote Cody Leach, a student of Barron's 
that posted with the hashtag '#freemrbarron'. He also posted a picture 
of a t-shirt made with the hashtag printed on it.

In a recorded message sent to district employees on Sunday night, Monroe Public Schools Supt. Dr. Barry Martin said the information that was reported was incorrect and that the district was not opposed to Mr. Barron’s teaching methods.

'As a result of incorrect information presented within the community, there is a perception that the district was opposed to a teacher providing students with information about the history of racial issues in this country,' Dr. Martin said in a phone message and through a posting on the Monroe Public Schools Facebook page.

'This simply is not true and is a misinterpretation of the concern.'

'Mr. Barron is very pleased that he will be allowed to return to the classroom and the students that he has dedicated the past 36 years of his career to,' Mr. Barron said in a statement released through his lawyer.

'He looks forward to spending the final three weeks of his career doing what he loves: teaching the young people of Monroe.'
