Whilst she still proves her worth as a supermodel, Cara is in the midst of rebranding herself as a Hollywood star.

Speaking to The Guardian's G2 supplement, he admitted that he didn't actually know who she was before meeting her, despite her global fame, but claimed she is a 'quality' actor.

'I didn't really know who she was, but as soon as I met her I knew she'd be perfect for [the role],' he said.

'The film is pretty much entirely scripted so she is acting, but it's a quality of hers which she's projecting.'
