High school students in Florida have caused concern among religious leaders after posting a picture online of a drinking game called 'Jews vs Nazis' beer pong.

The picture, which features cups set out in the shape of a swastika and the Star of David, was apparently submitted to a Twitter feed by students from Cape Coral High School, in Florida.

The @HSConfessional post, which has now been retweeted nearly 1,800 times, also makes the claim that: 'This is what we play at parties.'

Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz, of the Chabad Lubavitch, of Southwest Florida, told Fox4 said: 'As a rabbi, I like to look at the world as a beautiful place.

'So, my first assumption is let's assume it's just children that are immature with no ill intent, not trying to be malice.'

He added: 'This is a wake up call. We are not doing enough of a job educating people to be nicer, kinder, more polite.'

Beer pong is a drinking game which sees players throw a ping pong ball across a table towards cups of beer, which are traditionally arranged in the shape of a triangle.

If the ball lands in a cup the opposition has to drink the contents and the cup is removed from the table. The winner is the first team to remove all of the opposition's cups from the table.

This is not the first drinking game that has been brought to the public attention this year.

The NekNominate craze, which is thought to have originated in Australia, has been heavily criticised by alcohol awareness charities for promoting dangerous levels of binge drinking.

The drinking challenge has claimed at least five lives in the past year.
