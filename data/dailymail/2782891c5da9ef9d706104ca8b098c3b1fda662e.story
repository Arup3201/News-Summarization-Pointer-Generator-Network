Lurking in the Swedish forest lies the most unusual holiday hideaway, perfect for those travellers desperate to get away from it all.

Suspended above the forest floor, up among the trees, is an invisible room - a mirrored tree house hidden in the foliage.

The hideaway can barely be seen, as reflections from the surroundings obscure the exclusive room.

The Mirror Cube is the star attraction at the Tree Hotel, which also offers guests the chance to rent out a UFO and a bird house.

For travellers wanting to escape it all, an unusual hotel, lurking in the depths of a Swedish forest, could offer the answer... The Mirror Cube

The stunning room is one of those on offer to guests staying at The Tree Hotel in Harads, in northern Sweden

Nestled high in the treetops, the 4x4metre room, accessed by a 12-metre rope bridge, features a queen size bed  

Nestled high in the treetops, the 4x4metre room, accessed by a 12-metre rope bridge, features a queen size bed.

The nearest house is 500metres away and owners Britta and Kent Lindvall say stress quickly fades away as guests enjoy the peace and purity of unspoiled nature.

But complete anonymity doesn't come cheap - the unusual room costs £213 a night.

That price includes breakfast at Mr and Mrs Lindvall's guest house further into the forest but if you fancy something special, the couple will put on a traditional Swedish three course meal including moose, reindeer and bear.

But there is one problem with the room, birds can struggle to spot it too.

To prevent birds from flying head-on into the mirrored walls, the four sides were clad with infrared film that only birds can see.

While the invisible tree house has just enough room for two, the Birds Nest can accommodate four who access via a retractable staircase.

And the eerie UFO can house two adults and two children for families who want a sci-fi themed holiday.

Mr Lindvall said: 'People appreciate sleeping high up in the trees with an incredible view and a feeling of freedom.

'The architects were given complete free reign to create their design and it feels great to create a new reason for travelling to Sweden and Swedish Lapland.

'The hotel is built around the ecological values in which substantial resources have been devoted to finding sustainable construction and energy solutions.'
