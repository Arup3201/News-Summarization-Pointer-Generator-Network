In a stadium named after a Greek war general from the early 1800s, Harry Kane and Andros Townsend set about proving they were worthy leaders in Tottenham Hotspur’s attacking quartet.

The Europa League has become the pair’s stomping ground and both started in the visit to the Theodoros Kolokotronis Stadium against Asteras Tripolis in Group C.

That is a luxury neither has been afforded in the Premier League by Mauricio Pochettino but, with a goal apiece in Greece in this 2-1 win, they staked their claim.

Townsend was named in Roy Hodgson’s 26-man England squad on Thursday for games against Slovenia and Scotland, despite playing just 108 minutes in four Premier League appearances so far this season.

The attacker has not enjoyed life under Pochettino as much as he did under Andre Villas-Boas.

But here in Greece, he had a point to prove to himself and his critics a year after scoring a 25-yard strike against Montenegro that all but guaranteed England would travel to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup.

Nacer Chadli, Erik Lamela, Christian Eriksen and Ryan Mason remain ahead in the pecking order at White Hart Lane, but Townsend’s first goal of the season for the north London club can go a long way.

In the 37th minute a penalty gave him that very chance. Immediately after Tottenham were awarded a penalty, Townsend grabbed the ball, making it painfully clear that no-one else was taking it but him.

A tidy finish rippled the right of the net, despite Asteras goalkeeper Tomas Kosicky diving the correct way, and the relief was there for the travelling Tottenham fans to see behind the goal.

Then, Townsend turned provider as Pochettino switched him from the right side to the left, which later turned out to be a shrewd move.

It may be a sign of Pochettino’s faith in Kane that the striker played as a lone forward. The Tottenham youth product isn’t always used in that sense, sometimes blending in to the attacking three behind.

But, with Adebayor left behind in London, Pochettino’s apparent third-choice striker took to the stage.

A fine cross by Townsend was inviting, and Kane nodded it beyond Kosicky to double the lead before half-time.

This was a Tottenham attack led by two potential England stars tearing apart a team that had not been beaten at home in four months.

Kane, absent in Hodgson’s 26-man list, must continue to battle for a Premier League place under Pochettino but his tireless efforts in Greece could prove his downfall, however.

Kane is poised to lose his starting place in Sunday’s Premier League match against Stoke City after this energetic performance, despite scoring a last-minute winner against Aston Villa a week ago.

The mood in Tripolis was that this was the biggest match in the Greek club’s history. Win, and Group C was tipped on its head.

The feeling was mutual for Pochettino whose honeymoon period is over, having found himself under pressure for the first time since beginning his Premier League managerial career.

But the Tottenham boss has now beaten Villa, saw off a pesky Asteras, and has Stoke in his sights. What a difference a week can make.
