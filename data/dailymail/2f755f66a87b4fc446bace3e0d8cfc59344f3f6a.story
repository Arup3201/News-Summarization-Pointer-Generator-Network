The UPS cargo jet that crashed in Alabama this week, killing its two crew members, was flying on autopilot until seconds before impact, even after an alert that it was descending too quickly, authorities said on Saturday

'The autopilot was engaged until the last second of recorded data,' said Robert Sumwalt, a senior official with the National Transportation Safety Board.

He said information retrieved by investigators from the flight data recorder aboard the United Parcel Service jet showed that its auto throttle also was engaged until moments before the fiery crash.

Crash site: Federal investigators say the pilots of a UPS cargo plane that crashed in Alabama on Wednesday were warned their descent was too steep, but that air-traffic controllers didn't receive a similar warning

Shorter runway: The UPS plane was attempting to land on runway 18 which is 5,000 ft shorter than the main runway which was closed for maintenance

Alternate approach: The plane was trying to land on runway 18 which is 5,000ft shorter than Birmingham airport's main runway. There is a hill and some trees at one end which can make it 'tricky' for larger jets

The Airbus A300 jet was approaching 
the runway at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth airport before dawn on Wednesday 
when it clipped the trees in an adjacent residential area and crashed 
into a steep embankment well short of the runway.

Sumwalt,
 who spoke at a media briefing near the crash site, had said on Friday 
that the pilots received a low altitude warning barely seven seconds 
before the sound of impact. He repeated that in his remarks on Saturday 
but did not say whether the alert had triggered any attempt by the crew 
members to disengage the autopilot as part of a last-ditch attempt to 
abort landing and re-gain altitude.

The pilots did not issue a distress call.

Sumwalt
 stopped short of saying there was anything unusual about a so-called 
'instrument approach' to the airport using autopilot.

But
 he said the NTSB would be looking closely into 'UPS's instrument 
approach procedures' and how it typically went about guiding a large 
cargo hauler to touchdown on Birmingham-Shuttleworth's Runway 18.

That's
 the runway the UPS jet was approaching when it crashed and Sumwalt said
 the investigation would include a flight test at the airport in a UPS 
A300.

'We haven't ruled anything in, haven't ruled anything out,' he said.

The aircraft went down less than a mile from the end of Runway 18 at Birmingham's airport before dawn Wednesday. UPS has identified the victims of the crash as Capt. Cerea Beal, Jr., 58, of Matthews, N.C., and First Officer Shanda Fanning, 37, of Lynchburg, Tennessee.

Landing on the runway can be tricky for pilots, an expert said, particularly those flying big jets like the twin-engine UPS cargo carrier. Sumwalt said the plane was being flown by the captain — who had 8,600 hours of flight experience, including 3,200 hours in an A300 — but investigators don't know whether Beal or Fanning had ever before landed on Runway 18.

'We're going to do our best to find out,' he said.

Sumwalt said investigators will analyze the airplane's weight to determine whether it should have attempted a landing on the runway, the shorter of two runways at Birmingham Shuttlesworth International Airport.

With a large hill and trees at one end, the runway lacks the electronics for a full instrument landing. That forces pilots to make key judgments about altitude while aiming a descending aircraft at a runway that's 5,000 feet shorter than the airport's main runway, which was closed for maintenance work at the time of the crash.

Some pilots simply avoid landing on Runway 18 when possible, said veteran commercial pilot Ross Aimer.

'When I heard they were using Runway 18 it caught my attention because of that hill,' said Aimer. 'It's sad, but it didn't surprise me.'

Aimer, a retired United Airlines captain, is now chief executive of Aero Consulting Experts, a firm based in Los Angeles.

Kevin Hiatt, president
 and chief executive officer of the Flight Safety Foundation, an 
Alexandria, Virginia-based international watchdog group, told Reuters in
 an interview on Thursday that a 'full instrument' landing was not 
highly advisable at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth.

The airport can be tricky to land at because it is nestled among hills and that is especially true of Runway 18, said Hiatt.

Hiatt, a former Delta Airlines pilot, said he had touched down on the runway many times himself.

'It
 is not a full instrument landing. You have to visually fly into that 
runway,' he said. 'Sometimes it takes nuance to land there. You have to 
realize that hill is there or you could come in too low.'

The crash occurred shortly before dawn in rainy conditions as low-lying clouds hung over Birmingham.

So far, Sumwalt said there was nothing to indicate the crash was caused by engine failure or any mechanical issues.

He
 also said the runway lights were examined and found to have been 
'within one one-100th of a degree of being properly aligned' at the time
 of the crash.

UPS has 
identified the dead crew members Cerea Beal Jr., 58, of Matthews, North 
Carolina, and Shanda Fanning, 37, of Lynchburg, Tennessee.

As
 a standard part of any accident investigation, Sumwalt said the NTSB 
was looking into the physical and mental well being of Beal and Fanning 
in the 72 hours before the accident.

Beal,
 the captain of the downed aircraft, had about 8,600 hours total flying 
experience, including more than 3,200 hours in the Airbus A300, 
according to the NTSB.

The
 NTSB previously said a preliminary investigation didn't reveal any 
evidence of engine failure before the plane struck trees about one mile 
away from the end of the runway. It crashed into the bottom of a hill 
less than a quarter mile after hitting the trees.

The
 A300, which weighs about 172,700 pounds when empty, was at the end of a
 45-minute flight from Louisville, Ky., to Birmingham when it went down.
 A flight summary from flightaware.com, which tracks airplanes, shows 
the aircraft made a descent in steps, which Aimer said is a 'dive and 
drive' method common on runways with the same navigational guidance as 
Runway 18.

Sumwalt said 
the aircraft went down during its first landing attempt. Sumwalt said 
investigators have not found any problems with the runway's lights or 
navigation system, which typically provides pilots with information 
about their lateral position but not about their altitude, unlike those 
on runways where pilots can land using only instruments. 

Tragic: Fire crews investigate where a UPS cargo plane lies on a hill at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport after crashing on approach

National Weather Service records from 
the morning of the crash show the plane would have descended through 
overcast conditions to only a few clouds at 1,100 feet. Within seconds 
after the plane hit a tree and at least one turbine sucked in wood, the 
twin-engine plane crashed.

It
 hit the base of that large hill mentioned by Aimer, who said he had 
landed on Runway 18 about a half-dozen times, including on some flights 
as a cargo pilot.

Located 
near the southern tip of the Appalachian foothills, Birmingham's airport
 is nestled in a low spot between Red Mountain to the south and hills 
that lie at the northern end of Runway 18, which is 7,000 feet long. The
 main runway is 12,000 feet long and runs east and west, meaning pilots 
don't have to negotiate the rough terrain.

The
 NTSB said the longer runway was closed for maintenance work on its 
lights early Wednesday, leaving the shorter runway as the only path to 
the ground. Runway 18 is an approved runway with a valid approach, Aimer
 said.

'It is definitely legal, but it I had a choice I'd use another runway first,' he said.

Disaster: What appears to be parcels are strewn across a field after a UPS cargo plane came down shortly before dawn in Alabama

A
 key task for investigators will be determining why the UPS jet was low 
enough to hit trees. The impact sheared off pieces of the aircraft and 
sent them crashing onto two homes along with large pieces of limbs.

Keenen
 Brown, 17, said he witnessed the crash while getting ready for work 
before dawn. Brown, who lives with relatives across the street from the 
crash site, said it was unusual to see such a large aircraft attempting 
to land on the runway.

'I 
saw the sky turn orange and I looked up and I saw it in the air on 
fire,' Brown said. 'I watched it hit the ground and dirt flew up. This 
whole area just shook.'

Aimer said the flames could have been shooting from the plane after it struck the trees.
