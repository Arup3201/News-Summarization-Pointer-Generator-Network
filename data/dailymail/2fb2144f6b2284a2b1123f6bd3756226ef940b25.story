'Confidence coach' Lydia Frempong, from Cheam, Surrey, falsely claimed £5,000 in benefits by pretending she was unemployed

A life coach hired by Channel 4 to give confidence lessons to staff swindled £5,000 in false benefits by pretending she was unemployed.

Lydia Frempong, from Cheam, Surrey, pocketed more than £4,500 in Jobseeker's Allowance and more than £500 in Council Tax Benefit, despite a raft of experience as an events organiser and 'confidence coach'.

Frempong, who has a life coaching diploma from Cambridge University, boasts on her website about her 'extensive' experience in the life coach sector, including with the TV broadcaster.

Her website also says that she has worked
'extensively' with media professionals and celebrities 'to aid career progression and 
improve confidence'. 

But Camberwell Green Magistrates' court heard how Frempong scammed taxpayers out of Council 
Tax Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance, between 
July 2012 and January 2013.

The businesswoman, who now runs her own business Butterfly PR, pleaded guilty to two charges of dishonestly failing to notify Sutton Council about a change in her circumstances, which meant she was no longer entitled to the benefits.

After her convictions, she told MailOnline it was an 'oversight' and that she had not intended to 'utilise the system'.

She said: 'I have always been a industrious person who has contributed towards society and this particular incident was an oversight as I was trying to establish a new career.

'It was not my intention to utilise the system in this way and I have been working hard since I was a teenager.

'I would like to now put this regrettable incident behind me, pay back what is owed and move forward.'

Frempong's scam was revealed during a probe by the benefit investigation team at Sutton Council which found she had been falsely paid £4,525 in Jobseeker's Allowance and £520 in Council Tax Benefit.

She was sentenced to 110 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £60. She also paid court costs of £85.

Frempong - who was described in court as being of previous good character - was also ordered to pay back 
the money. 

Speaking after the case, Councillor 
Nick Emmerson, lead member for revenues and benefit at the council said: 'Thanks to our benefits investigation team we found that Ms 
Frempong lied in order to falsely claim thousands of pounds in benefits.

'We
 believe in a fair council that supports residents with the benefits 
they are entitled to. Ms Frempong has abused the system and must now 
return this money.'

Frempong pleaded guilty to two counts of benefit fraud at Camberwell 
Green Magistrates' Court after falsely claiming Jobseeker's Allowance - 
even though she was employed as a life coach, including by Channel 4

On her website, Frempong describes 
herself as a self-made entrepreneur who spent 
four years working at the Media Trust - which works with charities in 
the media and of which Channel 4's Jon Snow is chair - where she says 
she generated £1m worth of revenue 
from scratch.

She then 
created her own business, Butterfly PR, which 'has been responsible for 
the success of myriad personalities, events, organisations and 
partnerships'.

In 2011, Frempong 
was also given the 'Leadership in the 
Workplace Award' by Business in the Community - a charity endorsed by Prince Charles.

'I would like to now put this regrettable incident behind me, pay back what is owed and move forward'

Lydia Frempong

She began working for Channel 4 as an ambassador and workshop leader for a careers advice roadshow, before being hired on a 'freelance basis' to 'deliver
 life coaching sessions, encourage personal development and further
 career progression for their employees'.

At the time of her appointment, Channel
 4 described Frempong as 'an exceptionally talented coach and trainer'.

It says: 'As a confidence coach, Lydia is passionate about developing the potential in people, and has a particular interest in coaching young people to develop professionally and emulate her success.'

According to her website, her other work includes delivering motivational talks and appearing on key industry panels such as the Ernst & Young and Future 100 Awards.

A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'Lydia Frempong has worked with Channel 4 on an ad-hoc freelance basis. She is not an employee of the corporation.'
