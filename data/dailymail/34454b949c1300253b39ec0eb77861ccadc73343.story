A Second World War veteran quite literally had a blast from the past when he was given the chance to fire a 25-pound field nearly 70 years since he last operated heavy artillery.

Retired sergeant major Arnold Woodward, 88, served in Italy, Greece, Palestine and Egypt from 1942 to 1947.

But he took a trip down memory lane thanks to son Stuart who arranged for him to fire the howitzer at a historical reenactment during the ‘Explosion of History’ fair at Pendennis Castle, in Falmouth, Cornwall.

Blown away: Second World War veteran Arnold Woodward fires a howitzer field gun at a historical reenactment in Falmouth, Cornwall, nearly 70 years since he last operated heavy artillery

Grandfather-of-one Arnold said: 'We went in there because we heard they had this gun. My son Stuart did the dirty on me by telling the people there I used to fire the gun.

'They came over and asked me if I would like to fire it. I was quite shocked to be asked at first, but I wasn’t going to turn down the opportunity of having another go.

'It was an experience. It was 68 years ago when I last fired one of those guns so it felt really exhilarating.

'The first time was a bit emotional but the second time I got used to it. It felt different because I was only shooting blanks this time, but in the army I was obviously firing real rounds, that is a completely different kettle of fish.

Down memory lane: Mr Woodward's son Stuart arranged for him to fire the howitzer at a historical reenactment during the 'Explosion of History' fair at Pendennis Castle, in Falmouth, Cornwall

Weapon of choice: The Ordnance QF 25-pounder was a standard piece of British Army field artillery from 1940 right up until the 1980s

'It brought back so many memories for me, some were nice, although some were not very nice obviously.

'But at the end of the day I am glad that I went down and had a go on the gun after all this time.'

The Ordnance QF 25-pounder was a standard piece of British Army field artillery from 1940 right up until the 1980s. The 1.6ton howitzer could fire a single shells 7.6miles.

Stuart, 46, added: 'Everyone there loved him, they loved that they could talk to someone who used the gun in the war.

'It was a bit emotional but he had a big smile on his face by the end of it. I was so proud to see him behind the gun again.

'He is typical old school and doesn’t want a fuss but I told him it is a bit of history.

'When people speak about the war they always go on about the spitfires and they do not recognise the artillery very much.

'I am hoping that people can soon realise that every part of it was needed for us to win the war.

'But seeing him do it on the day was amazing, I was thrilled to bits for him.'
