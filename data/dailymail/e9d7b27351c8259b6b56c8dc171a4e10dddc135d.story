As Britain celebrated the beginning of 2014, pictures taken of last night's New Year's Eve revelry reveal many will have woken with a very sore head this morning and some may even have slept in a police cell or a hospital bed.

From Swansea to Manchester, Birmingham to London, and Liverpool to Newcastle, partygoers were drunk and dishevelled as they spilled out of bars, clubs and parties and onto the streets last night.

As usual, while the majority enjoyed an evening with friends and loved-ones, the drunken minority were unable to control themselves after taking the opportunity to let their hair down.

And in some instances they ended up on the wrong side of the law, with Scotland Yard revealing that 100 people were arrested for drunken, violent or sexual crimes during the celebrations in central London.

Meanwhile Ambulance trusts said they received one phone call every 15 seconds last night as they dealt with the results of excessive drinking.

Liverpool: Liverpudlian revellers partied hard as they celebrated the arrival of 2014 but the streets where lined with extra police to control the crowds and in case trouble broke-out

Officers made 39 arrests for drunk and disorderly behaviour and 21 for assault, with others arrested for drugs offences, affray, sexual offences, theft and carrying an offensive weapon.

Chief Inspector Robyn Williams said: 'Visitors were not put off by the threat of wind and rain and the viewing areas filled up quicker than ever before.

'Officers worked hard, alongside stewards, to keep people safe during the event and ensure that everyone who came into central London was able to make their way home at the end of the night.

'Crowds were good natured and there were no major issues reported to police.'

The force had 3,800 officers on duty 
for fireworks alone, while London Ambulance Service received 1,100 calls
 between 7pm and midnight, and 469 in the first hour of 2014.

Devon and Cornwall Police said they made nearly 120 arrests on New Year's Eve - with one standing out.

Custody Sergeant Howard Brugge based in Torquay said: 'How to get arrested on New Year's Eve - crash into a police car while drunk.'

He said there were 21 people in custody at Torquay, Devon, which was 'not too bad for New Year's Eve'. Around the force area there were a total of 199 people detained for various offences.

It is thought the bad weather and torrential weather put many partygoers off going out and yesterday the lashing rain meant the Exeter horse race meeting had to be called off.

A mammoth clean-up operation has begun
 after millions of people across the UK celebrated the start of 2014 
with fireworks, music and late-night drinking.

Events
 attracted party-goers across the country with 80,000 descending on 
Edinburgh for its famous Hogmanay street party and firework displays in 
Cardiff and Belfast.

Thousands
 of revellers in London braved the threat of rain to enjoy what was 
billed as 'the world's first multi-sensory fireworks display', when 
peach snow and orange-scented bubbles descended on a section of the 
crowd.

London mayor 
Boris Johnson said there was 'no better way to celebrate the highs of 
2013 and the start of an exciting new year' than enjoying 'one of the 
world's most dazzling fireworks displays'.

But the festivities created an estimated 85 tonnes of waste, including up to 15,000 champagne bottles, in central London.

Westminster
 Council deployed 52 vehicles and 119 members of staff through the night
 to ensure the streets were cleared for the capital's New Year's Day 
parade at midday.

Around half a million people are expected to attend the annual pageant, which could be hit by rain and strong winds.

The
 celebration parade will feature music from around the globe, leaving 
the Ritz Hotel at noon and winding through Piccadilly, Pall Mall and 
Trafalgar Square before ending in Parliament Square.

Meanwhile an air and sea search resumed today for a person swept out to sea on New Year's Eve after going for a paddle in rough water.

The missing person, who has not been named, had gone for a paddle with friends last night in the sea at Loe Bar, near Porthleven, Cornwall.

HM Coastguard said that when some of the group were up to their knees in the sea a large wave swept the person off their feet.

One of the group called 999 and spoke to Falmouth Coastguard who immediately sought help from Coastguard Rescue Teams at Penzance, Porthleven, Mullion and Porthoustock, RNLI lifeboats from Penlee and Lizard and a rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose.

The coastguard rescue teams, lifeboats and helicopter searched in atrocious weather conditions but were unable to find any sign of the missing person.

By 4.30am they had covered the search area many times over but were unable to find the person.Â 

Filthy work: More than 250,000 people turned out to watch the fireworks in central London but the result was piles and piles of mess, including here on Parliament Square

In front of the Eye: At the spot where many watched the fireworks street cleaners and rubbish collectors take part in a huge operation to clean up the streets of central London following New Year's Eve celebrations

Starting afresh: Council workers have already started clearing the mess from the streets of central London this morning as many dumped bottles and rubbish

The search was suspended until first light when the coastguard teams began another search.

Phil Mathias, Falmouth Coastguard watch manager, said: 'The weather for searching has been particularly challenging and as the night has gone on, conditions have deteriorated.

'There have been south to south westerly gale force to severe gale force winds with very rough sea and rain.

'The teams have conducted a very intensive search for the missing person.

'We have been able to focus our efforts into a relatively tight area because of onshore winds but have still been unable to locate the missing person.'
