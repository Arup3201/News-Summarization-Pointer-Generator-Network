Tragic: Ray Dibbs 36, died after a single punch sent him reeling to the floor and he hit his head on the pavement

A father of two was fatally injured when a single punch knocked him to the floor and he smashed his head on a kerb after he tried to defend a pensioner in his local pub.

Raymond Dibbs, 36, had popped 
in for a Saturday afternoon pint in his local public house when he went 
to the aid of an elderly drinker who he heard being mocked as 'a bloody 
retard' by a younger man.

An inquest heard it led to a fight outside, during 
which Mr Dibbs was punched once in the face, fell and hit his 
head on the kerb.

The businessman, whose father Tory Cllr Roland Dibbs is deputy leader the deputy leader of Rushmoor Borough Council, was airlifted to hospital but died 24 hours later.

The tragic death shocked regulars at the Old Courthouse public house in Farnborough, Hampshire.

Police arrested 37-year-old Luke Boswell but he was later released without charge.

Mr Dibbs was operations manager at global education firm WRS International and the only son of Cllr Roland Dibbs, the deputy leader of Rushmoor Borough Council.

Alton Coroner's Court heard he was angered when he heard Mr Boswell call pensioner John Hayter a 'retard' while he was drinking with him in the bar.

Mr Dibbs confronted 6ft 1ins tall Mr Boswell but the pair were separated by the barman and Mr Boswell went outside for a cigarette.

Mr Dibbs was then heard to say “I’m not being spoken to like that” before he rushed past punters, out of a side door and began wildly swinging at Mr Boswell outside of the pub, the inquest heard.

The animated reaction was said to be out of character for Mr Dibbs who was described as intellectual and placid.

Barman Fred Lamont told the inquest jury: 'You could tell Ray wasn’t the fighting type. He was swinging both arms in an uncontrollable manner. He was "wind milling".

'As Ray got closer, Luke put up his left foot and right hand to block him and Ray has obviously connected with his foot as it’s raised and taken a huge stumble backwards - he was right on the edge of the kerb.

'As he was stumbling backwards, Luke swung at him. The first punch came across his shoulder but from where I was standing I couldn’t see if that connected.

'Ray tripped off the kerb and where he was trying to correct himself, he span around and landed on the side of his head.'

A post-mortem established the businessman died from a head injury. He had a fractured skull and signs of haemorrhaging on the brain.

Toxicology tests found he had around twice the legal alcohol limit for driving in his system, but not enough to be 'rolling drunk' at the time of the fight.

Mr Boswell, who had been banned from pubs in the area in the past, was seen by several witnesses to punch Mr Dibbs in the side of the head during the altercation.

Accidental death: A jury at Alton Coroner's Court ruled that Mr Dibbs died of accidental death

One drinker, Sean Hunter, said: 'Ray was a lovely fellow but he was not a fighter. He swung a few punches and Luke blocked them. Luke threw one. It was not a decent punch, but Ray went down. It connected to his face, probably the cheekbone area.'

It emerged at the inquest that frail Mr Hayter would often pick fights with drinkers at the Old Courthouse after he’d had a few drinks - especially Luke Boswell - and is known to shadow box at the bar. But Mr Dibbs was not a regular and wouldn’t have realised this when he went to the older man’s defence on April 14.

Giving evidence, Mr Boswell said: 'John Hayter is always causing trouble. He is who he is. He does it all the time, and if it’s not to me it’s to someone else. He does it every time you go in the pub, it does get to you, it’s annoying.

'I was sitting there in the corner with my friends. He (Hayter) kept going on - he’d clearly already had more than his two pints that day. It’s always the same with him. I just told him to shut up to be honest.

'Ray had literally been in the pub three or four minutes when I said to John - and I feel sorry for saying it now - "shut up you bloody retard".

'Ray turned around and said "who are you calling a retard?" and I said "I ain’t talking to you, I’m talking to him".

'Then Ray said "you’re the bloody retard" and I said "I’m sick and tired of this. I’ve had him [Hayter] starting now I don’t need you starting" and then I walked out of the pub.'

Mr Boswell told how he smoked a cigarette and then he saw Mr Dibbs coming towards him outside of the pub.

He said he reacted to defend himself, adding: 'One blow and that was it. I stood there just in shock. I looked at him covered in blood and I panicked a bit. Someone came out of the pub and said "Luke, the best thing for you to do is go" and that’s what I did.

'It should never have happened, never in my eyes. I thought if I go outside and have a cigarette and it would all have calmed down. He’s come towards me swinging his arms, I stuck my foot out to stop him, missed him and after that it was literally seconds before he was on the floor.'

Mr Boswell added: 'I would like to know whether it’s my fault that he came off the kerb or if he just slipped. I don’t know and I’m never going to know...I think about it all the time.'

After questioning Mr Boswell, police released him as there was no evidence to suggest that it was a murder case or that the suspect intended to cause serious harm.

Mr Dibbs lived in affluent West Heath Road, Farnborough, Hampshire, with his partner Rachel, their two children Harley, aged three years, and Lily, aged 10 years; and Rachel’s eldest son from a previous relationship, Zack, aged 17 years.

Rachel and Mr Dibbs’s father were in court for the inquest. A jury of four men and four women returned a verdict of accidental death.

Paying tribute to his son, a tearful Cllr Dibbs said: 'He was a good son and a very good father. He’s hugely missed by his whole family.

'I don’t think there can ever be closure. Rachel has got two children and I’ve got two grandchildren who will grow up without a father who, of course, they miss terribly.

'We cannot understand how this has happened. Ray was not a violent person or likely to get into any fights.

'He was a very successful businessman who worked hard all his life and has never been out of work. He was very popular and well liked.'
