Australia coach Darren Lehmann has no intention of saving Mitchell Johnson for a World Cup assault on England and will recall the paceman as soon as possible.

Johnson was the runaway man-of-the-series in last winter's Ashes and there are serious concerns about how England will react should he find his very best form again in the tournament opener in Melbourne on February 14.

He has been missing for the last few weeks with fitness niggles and undisclosed personal reasons, and there have been suggestions Lehmann might hold his strike bowler back until that match, denying England closer look should they reach the final of the ongoing Tri-Series.

But Lehmann intends to reintegrate the left-armer at the first opportunity, potentially as soon as Monday's match against India.

'He'd be close. He's bowling (in the nets) and will be full training on Sunday, so hopefully he's available for selection,' said Lehmann.

'There's no resting. It's a final so there's a trophy up for grabs and we've got to try and win that so that's important for us as well.

'For us it's a case of worrying what we do well and keep doing that. We can't worry about England, we can only worry about what we're doing.'

The Australia line-up that beat England in Hobart on Friday was also missing captain George Bailey (banned), David Warner and Shane Watson (both hamstring).

Bailey will return having served his over-rate suspension, Warner is inked back in at the top of the order but Watson may take longer.

'Warner will be fine, he'll come back in, with Watson we'll just see how he goes at training,' added Lehmann.

'We want to get everyone 100 per cent fit for the final and then the World Cup so that's what we're looking at.'
