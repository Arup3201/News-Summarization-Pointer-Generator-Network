Still the shock waves from Salvador are shimmering through this World Cup. Holland 5, Spain 1: no matter how many times you read the statistic, it never makes a scrap of sense.

The finest team the modern game has seen were systematically dismantled by a Holland side whose best days had seemed behind them.

‘The end of an era’ was the instant critical reaction. A cliche, certainly, yet it may well be true.

End of an era? Spain's period of dominance has been questioned following Friday's 5-1 loss to Holland

Football teams are like fighters; the more savage the beating, the more likely are they to lose their appetite for the fray. And beatings rarely come more savage than that which the Dutch handed out in the Arena Fonte Nova.

The search for scapegoats began with the final whistle. England followers will readily recognise the process.

The manager, Vicente del Bosque, has to go; immediately if not sooner. True, his team had lost just eight of 85 matches before Friday but that will not save him.

And he can take with him his hapless goalkeeper Iker Casillas, the ancient midfielders Xavi and Andres Iniesta and the entire back four. As for Fernando Torres, how did he get here anyway?

Time to go? Vicente del Bosque has only lost just nine of 86 matches as Spain coach

Carnage reigns. It appears that King Juan Carlos had a feeling that something like this might happen, which is why he abdicated the other day. Had he opted to hang around, he would surely have become another casualty.

But before axes flash and blood is spilled, we might remember just what Spain have meant to the game.

Between 2008-2012, they became champions of Europe, world champions and European champions once again, when they scored four unanswered goals against Italy in one of the most accomplished performances a major final has ever produced.

Yet recitation of the bald facts cannot convey the poise, the daring, the imagination, the sheer beauty of this extraordinary football team.

When they were at their best they expanded our notions of how the game might be played. They were wonderfully audacious.

They took chances and accepted the consequences when their plans proved unfruitful.

They knew that the game is infinitely better than bloodless pragmatists would have us believe and they clung to their expansive creed.

They never could understand the English obsession with physical contact. Xabi Alonso, once of Liverpool and now of Real Madrid, expressed his feelings succinctly: ‘I just don’t understand football in those terms.

Tackling is a last resort and you will need it, but it isn’t a quality to aspire to. It’s more important to construct a good team, to know how you are going to play, how to read the match. You have to truly understand the game.

‘From a Spanish perspective, what matters is the ball; possession of it, knowing what to do with it and when. Technique is vital and intelligence is fundamental.’

There are tactical minds in England who will suggest that Alonso might have flung a tackle or two at Holland in Salvador.

Why, there are pundits in Spain who are probably calling for his head at this very moment.

But his argument is a lucid exposition of a philosophy which brought his country so many prizes and so many more admirers.

Of course, the Dutch can boast a similarly excellent tradition of producing thinking footballers. Certainly this World Cup will be enhanced by their extended presence.

Yet the thoughts of many will be with the team that imploded so dramatically on Friday.

They lost their opening World Cup match last time, before twinkling through to the trophy, but that was quite different; a defeat rather than a disaster.

If they discover even a smidgeon of their old form, they can surely qualify second in their group. But they must be feeling like the golfer who shoots 90 in the first round of an Open; his task is not impossible but nobody is backing his chances.

For this generation of Spanish footballers, it may never be a glad, confident morning again. If so, there must be consolation in the memories.

For they endowed their sport with grace and style and, that inescapable word, beauty. They did the game some service and for that we should all be thankful.
