The consumer version of the much anticipated Oculus Rift virtual reality headset is just months away - and experts have started to speculate on what it could look like.

Facebook purchased the company earlier this year in a $2bn (£1.2bn) deal.

However, one expert says its success could depend on its design - and has created his own.

The sleek design has been made to resemble a set of hi-tech goggles - and its creator says he hopes people could mistake wearer's for simply having 'the world's fanciest goggles'.

CEO Brendan Iribe told the audience at Web Summit 2014 in Dublin earlier this year, that a consumer-version of the company's VR headset is 'close'.

MailOnline has been using the latest version of the headset, the $350 (£215) DK2 version aimed at developers wanting to write VR apps.

At first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when attached via straps.

However, once you are immersed in a virtual world, doubts were quickly forgotten.

The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good.

While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world.

The number of demos and games is already growing by the day, and feature everything from virtual rollercoaster rides to being lost in space, all made more immersive with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as your head moves.

It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality. 

Syed Rahman says he was inspired by the project - but not its design.

However, Rahman believes the firm still has a major task ahead - making it look attractive. 

'From a functionality standpoint, the Oculus Rift is spectacular, he said.

'I had the opportunity to visit their headquarters this past summer and was swept away by my incredible experience there. Virtual Reality is our future. But in order for widespread adoption they've got to overcome one last obstacle. Design.'

Rahamn says the technology must be made to look attractive. 

'As great as the Rift might be, how are we going to start sitting around with big black boxes strapped to our faces? Picture walking into a room, only to see your friends and family sitting around with boxes on their faces. I don't see that being a common scene anytime soon.'

'Ultimately I settled for a clean, sleek look,' he explains on his web site.

'The headset resembles ski goggles, a familiar object, finished with a reflective front. 

'To a passerby, you'd appear to be wearing the world's fanciest goggles on your face. 

Currently Oculus only sells its headset to developers.

CEO Brendan Iribe told the audience at Web Summit 2014 in Dublin earlier this year, that a consumer-version of the company's VR headset is 'close'.

He admitted the latest prototype, codenamed Crescent Bay, is 'largely finalized for a consumer product.'

'We're all hungry for it to happen,' he told the audience.

'We're getting very close. It's months, not years away, but many months.'

He also revealed one area holding back the product was the lack of a controller. 

He said keyboards, mice and gamepads aren't up to the job and neither is gesture-control.

'You want to feel it when you touch a button,' he said. 

Oculus acquired Carbon Design, the designers of the Xbox 360 controller in March.

Iribe also revealed that although the technology is currently similar to ski goggles, future versions will look like sunglasses. 

Iribe also revealed the company has changed significantly since it was acquired by Facebook in March. 

The current design: The Crescent Bay virtual reality headset (pictured) was unveiled at the Oculus Connect conference in Hollywood. It is lighter than its predecessor and features 360-degree tracking, but Oculus VR is yet to release the full list of specifications for the device.

Operating as an independent subsidiary, Oculus has grown from 75 people to over 200 employees and now operates a separate R&D division.

Asked about the threat of rival VR products, Iribe said his main concern is shoddy implementation.

In recent months dozens of firms have revealed low cost headsets using a movbile phone as the display. 

'We're a little worried about bigger companies putting out products that aren't ready. 

'Disorientation and motion sickness is the elephant in the room. 

'We're encouraging big companies not to put out a product before it's ready.

'We want to get it right, we don't want it to be four or five years. We're eager for this to happen.'

Rahman's 'ski goggle' design is far sleeker

Earlier this year the Facebook-owned firm has unveiled its Crescent Bay model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor, and now features 360-degree tracking.

Reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $200 (£122).  

Iribe says it is too early to say what the 'killer app' is - but said it could even be face to face talking.

'One that resonates with us internally is that this will have a big aspect of gaming, where you feel like you're in the game or movie.

'But when we can have face to face conversations, that's a big change'If in the future you can throw in a pair on sunglasses and have the same conversation we are having, that's really transformative.'

The 360-degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer's head movements, which in turn will make games more immersive and true-to-life.  

Elsewhere, the headset has a higher resolution, per eye, than the current second-generation development kit – DK2 - and these displays are powered by Samsung devices.

Rahman even design the headset's internals, showing how each part fits together

The headset resembles ski goggles, a familiar object, finished with a reflective front.

A teardown of the DK2 revealed that the headset uses Samsung Galaxy Note 3 displays, and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship Note 4.

By comparison, the DK2 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye, and the Note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution.

Aside from these specifications, Oculus VR is yet to release the rest of Crescent Bay's features.

'There are plenty of technical challenges left to solve for the consumer Rift, but Crescent Bay is truly the best virtual reality headset we've ever built,' said Mr Iribe.

The price of the Oculus Rift consumer model, which does not have a release date yet, was revealed by Oculus VR co-founder Nate Mitchell.

Speaking with Eurogamer, Mr Mitchell said the price could go up to $400 (£240), but that the price range was an estimate.

He also cautioned that nothing is set in stone.

'That could slide in either direction depending on scale, pre-orders, the components we end up using, [or] business negotiations,' he said.

Previously, Oculus VR said it was aiming to launch the consumer model for around $300 (£185).

Developers can currently buy protoype versions of the headset for $350 (£215).  

The firm also revealed earlier this month it has been working with Samsung on a mobile version of the headset, which will go on sale this year, but will not feature the advanced head tracking or high resolution display the Oculus version is expected to have.

Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when its $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved.

It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg.

A commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015.

The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, which has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year.
