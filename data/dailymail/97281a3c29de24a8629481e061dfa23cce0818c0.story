Indecent exposure: Robert Payne exposed himself to his neighbours and fired a shotgun into the air, a court heard

A former town councillor who urinated from the side of his houseboat while brandishing a gun has been found guilty of indecent exposure.

Robert Payne, 67, was accused of drunkenly exposing himself to his neighbours and firing a shotgun in the air near Shem Creek in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, as families marked Memorial Day weekend in 2011.

A court heard Payne, who was also convicted of presenting a firearm, pulled the stunt to 'irritate' his neighbours, who had complained that his houseboat was moored to close to their homes in Bayview Acres.

They said he had been spied drinking on the deck and urinating into the water.

Payne was cleared of a charge of assault and battery by a jury in Charleston County following a trial, the Charleston Post and Courier reported.

Police were called to the area on March 29 2011 amid reports of a man walking around drunk and naked in a marsh near Shem Creek.

Officers
attending the scene that evening found Payne clad only in a pair of 
swimming trunks and carrying a shotgun, according to an incident report.

It
said Payne was arrested after officers heard a gunshot, then saw the 
defendant walking towards them with while holding the weapon with the 
barrel pointed in the air.

Defence
lawyer Ashley Pennington had argued that Payne was not trying to harm 
anybody, but had fired the weapon to irritate his neighbours.

'This
was a case about annoying someone, not assaulting them,' said the 
lawyer, who added that the one-time town councillor was making a 
constitutionally protected 'symbolic statement' when he raised his 
middle finger at one neighbour.

Julie
Cardillo, prosecuting, had said two neighbours, including one 
accompanied by a young boy, had thought Payne - who served on Mount 
Pleasant's town council between 1976 and 1980 - was aiming the shotgun 
at them.

Payne was found 
guilty of indecent exposure and pointing or presenting a firearm today. 
He was found not guilty on a charge of assault and battery.
