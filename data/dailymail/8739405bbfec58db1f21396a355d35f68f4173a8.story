Demi Moore was rushed to hospital last night to be treated for problems rumoured to be related to 'substance abuse' and 'anorexia', it has been claimed.

The 49-year-old actress, who has appeared increasingly frail in recent weeks, was taken to hospital by ambulance following a call to 911 just before 11pm last night after the actress allegedly suffered a seizure.

The mother-of-three was with a female friend when she allegedly began shaking, it has been reported.

After being admitted to hospital, website Radar claim she is being treated for anorexia, among other substance abuse issues.

The news emerged as her young 
husband, 33, from whom she is estranged, was pictured enjoying a beer as he 
partied with friends at a Bruno Mars gig in Brazil.

Ashton has been in the South American country for its fashion week.

Seeking help: Demi, seen here earlier this month with her daughter Rumer was admitted to hospital on Monday night

The 49-year-old Ghost star has become
 frighteningly thin since her split with husband Ashton Kutcher, and a 
source close to the actress described what happened to her.

A source told Radar: 'She collapsed after having an epileptic seizure... she has not taken care of her health at all lately and has lost a ton of weight.'

'Demi is in getting treated for anorexia, as well as other issues that caused her seizure,' the source added.

In the weeks before her hospitalisation, Demi was spotted letting loose on a wild night out with her daughter Rumer, 23.

On the night of January 11 she joined her eldest child at Hollywood hot spot Beacher's Madhouse where sources tell Us Weekly magazine she was 'table 
dancing while three guys sat there watching.'

At least one onlooker claims she appeared intoxicated, although others only saw her drinking Red Bull.

Representatives for the star refused to directly comment on the substance abuse allegations. But her spokesperson said the actress is seeking 'professional assistance' after the stresses of recent months.

Moving on: The Two And A Half Men star is said to be dating someone his own age

Demi and Ashton's six year marriage 
foundered in 2011 after Star magazine's shock report that Ashton cheated
 on Demi with starlet Sara Leal the weekend of their wedding 
anniversary.

She announced that she was separating from him but has yet to file divorce papers.

According to TMZ a 911 call was 
placed at 10:45pm last night. The actress was assessed at home before 
being taken to a local hospital.

Her spokesperson told 
MailOnline in a statement: ‘Because of the stresses in her life right now, Demi has 
chosen to seek professional assistance to treat her exhaustion and 
improve her overall health.

'She looks forward to getting well and is 
grateful for the support of her family and friends.’

Unaware: Demi's estranged husband Ashton was seen out drinking beer at a Bruno Mars Concert in Brazil last night while Demi was rushed to hospital

Demi's frail and gaunt appearance in recent weeks has caused considerable concern.

The
 actress, who announced last November that she was divorcing husband 
Ashton Kutcher, has lost a considerable amount of weight over the past 
four 
months.

And today it was announced she has pulled out of a cameo appearance in the film about porn star Linda Lovelace  in which she had been cast as feminist icon Gloria Steinem.

While Demi is seeking treatment her estranged husband is currently in Sao Paulo where he has been attending the Fashion Week.

He was seen enjoying a beer with friends at a Bruno Mars concert, oblivious to the drama involving his wife.

The Two And A Half Men star is also said to have moved on following the breakdown of his marriage.

Demi last appeared in public on January 14 at the Cinema For Peace event at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills.

Her frail appearance shocked fans, 
although she appears to have been losing weight steadily since claims 
emerged Ashton had cheated on her with 22-year-old Sara Leal.

Demi,
 who looked a shadow of her former self, wore a slim fitting black dress
 which showed just how much weight she had lost from her usually toned 
physique.

On November 17 2011, Demi announced that she was filing for divorce from her toyboy husband after six years of marriage.

In a statement she said: 'It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton.

'As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life.'

He is now reportedly dating screenwriter Lorene Scafaria, who, at 33, is his own age.

The pair spent Christmas together in Europe.

Earlier this month Demi was seen in a parking lot with a 26-year-old actor and personal trainer Blake Corl-Baietti.

Her representatives refused to comment on speculation that the actress was in a relationship with the younger man.

Demi recently opened up about her fears and heartache in an interview with US Harper's Bazaar.

She admitted: ‘What scares me is that I’m going to ultimately find out at the end of my life that I’m really not lovable, that I’m not worthy of being loved.

'That there’s something fundamentally wrong with me.’

As well as speaking out about her anxieties, she also opened up about her body image.

The actress - who went through a gruelling fitness regime for her role in GI Jane - admitted to having had a ‘love-hate relationship’ with her body but said she had a more positive view of it now.

She said: ‘I sit today in a place of greater acceptance of my body and that includes not just my weight but all of the things that come with your changing body as you age to now experiencing my body as extremely thin.’

Demi added: ‘Thin in a way that I never imagined somebody would be saying to me, “You’re too thin, and you don’t look good".'
