Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford could yet be back in the Premier League with Middlesbrough after helping fire them into an automatic-promotion place.

The 21-year-old harbours ambition of returning to Stamford Bridge as part of Jose Mourinho’s senior set-up next season.

But given Bamford’s tender years and the likes of Diego Costa, Loic Remy and Didier Drogba ahead of him in the pecking order, Boro boss Aitor Karanka could well use his friendship with Mourinho to secure the striker for another season should they win promotion.

‘I was very pleased when Patrick extended his loan here (on January 1). He looks a better player every day,’ said the former Real Madrid assistant manager.

‘He is more mature. He takes more responsibility. It was important for Patrick to score tonight (after six games without a goal).’

Karanka’s side travel to Manchester City in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday but, Bamford apart, there was little to worry the team who also sit second in the Premier League.

The Teessiders have struggled for goals in recent weeks and that much was apparent during the first half.

The best chance was fashioned after just 30 seconds, Bamford escaping down the right and drawing back for Kike, unmarked on the edge of the area.

A heavy first touch robbed the Spaniard of space and the resulting snap shot was blocked by the sliding Ben Turner. That excitement was not a sign of things to come.

Just before the break Bamford drilled wide from 30 yards and that was as close as either side came to an opener.

But the England Under-21 star got his goal on 63 minutes. Adam Reach scampered down the left and centred for Bamford and, when his first effort was blocked, he seized on the loose ball before smashing home.

Substitute Albert Adomah had the chance to put the game to bed when freed by Bamford but his low blast was smothered by Moore.

However, Lee Tomlin was to make no mistake on 79 minutes with Reach again the provider from the left, the striker accepting the invitation of a side-footed finish from close range.

There was a late scare when former Sunderland forward Kenwyne Jones headed a response for the visitors but Boro held on to move within one point of leaders Bournemouth after their surprise defeat at Leeds.
