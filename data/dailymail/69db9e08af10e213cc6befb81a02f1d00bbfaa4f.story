At first it was seen merely as a way for friends and minor celebrities to share gossip and pointless babble.

Now, as well as self-promotion, Twitter is used to organise campaigns and even revolution.

So it is no surprise that tweeting is de rigeur for our politicians – even if there are a few surprises in the people they choose to follow.

Who they follow: A full breakdown of MPs' online habits... which reveals some very surprising results

Unlikely fans: Labour leader Ed Miliband follows reality TV star Joey Essex from The Only Way is Essex

The MPs’ list includes such unlikely fonts of wisdom as Keith Chegwin, The Fonz, X Factor judges and lads’ mag models.

Ed Miliband, it seems, likes to keep up with the utterances of Joey Essex, who used to appear on ITV2 series The Only Way Is Essex and came fourth on I’m A Celebrity.

The 23-year-old’s recent profound musings include: ‘Had a nice lay-in today... Best sleep in ages! ... Now getting prepared for the day :-)’.

Others followed by the Labour leader include The Fonz from Happy Days – or at least Henry Winkler, the actor who played him – presenter Myleene Klass and rock star Bruce Springsteen.

Five years ago David Cameron famously declared: ‘The trouble with Twitter is the instantness of it – too many twits might make a t***.’

Twitter fans: London Mayor Boris Johnson gets regular updates from X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger

Today, the Prime Minister has more 
than half a million followers and follows 331 twitterati, including 
Tory-supporting X-Factor judge Gary Barlow, TV presenter Phillip 
Schofield, DJ Chris Evans and singer Ellie Goulding.

The two leaders also keep tabs on many fellow politicians but are not alone in peppering their choice of who to follow with some wild cards.

Boris Johnson follows comedian Ricky Gervais and X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger, with whom he opened the Westfield shopping centre overlooking London’s Olympic stadium in 2011.

Foreign Secretary William Hague follows the witty comments of Jimmy Carr and Victoria Coren Mitchell, while the 1,271 people followed by Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman include Speaker’s wife Sally Bercow.

Labour peer Oona King follows one-time TV star Keith Chegwin and Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander keeps up with the latest from former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, who likes tweeting pictures of her dog.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage follows model Imogen Thomas and Strictly Come Dancing’s Aliona Vilani, while Respect leader George Galloway follows Right Said Fred... whose biggest Nineties hit was I’m Too Sexy.
