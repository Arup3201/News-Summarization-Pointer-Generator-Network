They were comrades in arms who died on the battlefields of Syria, fighting for the Islamic State - but just years earlier they were well mannered boys at one of London's top schools.

Mohammed el-Araj, 23, became only the second British fighter to be killed during an ambush on Assad forces last year.

And during the first day of Ramadan, his former school mate, Mohammed Nasser, 21, died after shrapnel hit him in the head.

The pair attended Holland Park School, where they held open doors for teachers and handed out books in class. The school is so well thought of, David Cameron is considering sending his eldest child Nancy there.

Hamzah Parvez, who is still believed to to be fighting President's Assad's forces, also attended the school, as did three others linked to ISIS. 

Today their former teacher at the school known as the 'Eton of comprehensives', remembered the duo were mannered and full of potential.

The ex-teacher who declined to be named, told the Sunday Express: 'I remember these grown-up men as gorgeous, funny, warm, gentle boys. 

'Mohamed el-Araj was a naughty little bugger but in the right hands he could have been amazing; he was a bright spark.

Mohammed Nasser, left, and Hamzah Parvez, right, were described as a 'double act' and were well mannered

'He should be running a business or doing stand-up, not standing in a Godforsaken desert being cannon fodder.'

Last year Araj, left his family's flat in Blenheim Cescent, in Ladbroke Grove, and headed for Syria where he took the name Abu Khalid. Pictures of him on the internet showed him in a paramilitary uniform, holding an AK-47.

Not long afterwards he was dead.  

His teacher of five years said Araj was a 'little firecracker'. He was bright, she said, but often in trouble and would have fights with other boys.  

She said: 'He was properly naughty, properly disruptive and would shout and swear.

'He had a problem with being told what to do but probably half the boys I taught at Holland Park were just like him.'

Although Holland Park, in the heart of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, about 60 per cent of its pupils come from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds and speak English as a second language.

The teacher said Araj was a 'boundary breaker' and she wasn't surprised he wanted to become a jihadi. 

She said: 'I would not have been surprised if I had found out that he had got into a gang or into crime because like so many of his peers he was searching for meaning and a community and the school was not able to give it to them.' 

She described Nasser and Parvez as 'softer and sweeter boys'.

The boys were two years below Araj, who left the school in 2006, and also lived in Ladbroke Grove.  

On May 15 this year, the 21-year-old friends vanished. Three months later Parvez featured in an ISIS video where he made a call to arms. 

He asks the camera: 'What are we doing sitting in the UK?

'Sitting in the land which kills Muslims every day?

'It's not the land for us.

'Are we content with eating Nando's every week? Come to the land of Allah.'

He then reveals his friend, Nasser, had been killed in battle. 

The boy's teacher said he had the 'most beautiful little smile' and was 'so keen to please and do well'.

She said the boys were inseparable, a 'real double act'.   

Smoke and flames fill the air after U.S-led airstrikes in Kobane, Syria, which has been under siege by ISIS 

The teacher was at a loss to make sense of why the school was a breeding ground for extremists.

She said: 'That just goes to show the power of the radicalising message that even the loveliest ones can make terrible mistakes.'

The deaths, the teacher said, were 'horrific' and 'heartbreaking'. 

Another British Muslim to join the 'holy war' was Mohammed Hassan.

The 19-year-old's parents had thought he was beginning his first term at Surrey University to study international politics, when they received a letter from him saying he was now in Syria.

As the news sunk in his mother said, 'the whole room was spinning'. 

Hassan had said he was going to help victims of the civil war, but in reality, he and five friends from Portsmouth, had joined ISIS.

According to online reports, he is now near Kobane, which ISIS are being bombed by American airstrikes. 

Hassan's mother, who did not wish to be named, described her son as popular, and blessed with good looks. 

She said the turning point in her son's life, came after he took a 'gap-year' and started hanging out with an older crowd, among them, con man, Mashudur Choudhury, 31. During this time he become increasingly militant. 

On October 8 he travelled to Syria, via Turkey, along with Choudhury and three others. Choulhury returned to the UK a month later and was convicted of terrorist training and two others were shot dead. 

Hassan's father, Zahid, said his family were 'heartbroken' their son had been 'brainwashed' and prey for his safe return.
