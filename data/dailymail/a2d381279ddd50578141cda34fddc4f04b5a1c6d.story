Tributes have poured in for the 'gifted' and 'deep thinking' actor Paul Bhattacharjee, who starred in the James Bond film Casino Royale, after his body was found near cliffs two days after he went missing.

Mr Bhattacharjee, who also appeared in the soap Eastenders, had last been 
seen leaving rehearsals at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square, 
London, on Wednesday July 10 and appeared to walk in the direction of a 
nearby Tube station.

The 53-year-old was said to be in good spirits that evening but after sending his girlfriend a text message at 9pm, no-one heard from him and he was reported missing.

Scotland Yard was contacted by 
officers in Sussex this morning and told that the body of a man matching
 his description had been found near cliffs at Splash Point in Seaford, 
East Sussex, last Friday.

Mr Bhattacharjee, from Redbridge, 
north-east London, was formally identified today and his next of kin 
have been informed. His death is not being treated as suspicious.

Meera Syal, who appeared alongside him in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Much Ado about Nothing, said: 'Paul was an incredibly gifted, versatile and generous actor but also complex, deep thinking, engagingly opinionated and politically committed as a personality, truly wonderful to share a stage with.

'I don't think any of us who saw him recently or were working with him had any idea this awful tragedy was going to happen.

'We are all sending our love and prayers to his family and partner.'

Mr Bhattacharjee, of Redbridge, north-east London, was due to appear in this week's play Talk Show at the Royal Court. His role in the play, which began on Tuesday, was recast.

The theatre's artistic director Vicky Featherstone said: 'We are deeply shocked and completely devastated at the loss of our dear friend and brilliant colleague.

'Paul has been such an important part of the world of theatre in so many ways and we shall miss him terribly.

'We can't even begin to imagine the impact his loss will have on everyone who knew him and all of our thoughts are with his loved ones. '

His friends and family had made pleas
 for his safe return, including his 24-year-old son Rahul 
Bhattacharjee-Prashar, who told the Evening Standard the disappearance 
was 'completely out of character'.

Paul Bhattacharjee also made several TV appearances. Here he is seen opposite Peter Firth in the BBC spy series Spooks

Paul Bhattacharjee's theatre work included Moazzam Begg in the docu-drama Guantanamo at the Tricycle Theatre, north-west London, and Malvolio in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night at the Albery in London's West End

He added: 'He was doing well in his career and everything seemed to be going okay.'

Mr Bhattacharjee's agent had said he seemed 'completely fine' the last time she heard from him.

Sally Long-Innes, who works for the Independent Talent Group, said there
 were 'no clues' as to why he disappeared in his last text to her.

She said: 'He seemed completely fine to me. As far as we could tell there was nothing wrong with his state of mind.

'There were no clues in the last text message at all I'm afraid.'

The actor, who also appeared in The 
Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, White Teeth and Dirty Pretty Things, had 
been due to appear in this week's play Talk Show at the Royal Court. His
 role in the play, which began last night, was recast.

He was part of the theatre's company 
of 14 actors performing in the Weekly Rep series, which sees six plays 
staged in six weeks, and had already appeared in two of the productions.

Colleagues had taken to Twitter to 
express concern for Mr Bhattacharjee as news of his disappearance 
spread.

Bend It Like Beckham actress Parminder Nagra, Sex in the City 
star Kim Cattrall and Stephen Fry - who went missing for a week in 1995 -
 all appealed to their followers for information about the actor.

Tributes were last night being paid to the actor with many from the theatre world taking to Twitter to express their sadness.

Paul Bhattacharjee, who went missing after leaving the 
Royal Court Theatre on July 10, played the lead role of Benedick last year in the 
RSC's production of Much Ado About Nothing with Meera Syal as Beatrice

Director Jamie Lloyd wrote: 'Very sad to hear about the death of Paul Bhattacharjee. He was a very fine actor. My thoughts are with his family.'

Muzz Khan, who appeared in Much Ado About Nothing alongside the late actor, said: 'Rest In Peace, Paul Bhattacharjee. I can't believe you're gone, mate.'

Playwright Duncan Gates wrote: 'When you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave'. RIP Paul Paul Bhattacharjee.'

Actor Rick Warden wrote: 'Having a bad time with the news about friend and colleague Paul Bhattacharjee's death. An intelligent & charismatic man. Very sad.'

Mr Bhattacharjee had been due to 
perform in a production by Nitin Sawhney, who described the actor as a 
friend and wrote on Twitter that he was 'really worried' about his 
disappearance.

He played a doctor in Casino Royale 
in 2006 and was in several episodes of EastEnders as Inzamam between 
2008 and 2010. Other television credits for the actor included Waking 
the Dead, Spooks and The Bill.

Last year he appeared as Benedick opposite Meera Syal in an Royal Shakespeare Company production of Much Ado about Nothing.
