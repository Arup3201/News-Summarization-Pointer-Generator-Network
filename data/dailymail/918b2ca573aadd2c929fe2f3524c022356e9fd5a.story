Strawberries are certainly a versatile fruit, but not many take the shape of an animal.

Matthew Edmonds, 11, was stunned when he went to pick up couple of strawberries from his family garden in Portchester Fareham in Hampshire and spotted a rather unusual looking piece of fruit.

Instead of its usual heart-shape, the strawberry instead had a distinct likeness to a guinea pig.

The schoolboy, who has been learning gardening with his parents over the summer said: 'I saw it and I immediately thought it looked like a guinea pig.

Good spot: Matthew Edmonds, 11, who has been learning gardening over the school holidays, spotted the strangely-shaped fruit while picking strawberries in his garden

'I decided to leave it for a few more days so it could grow bigger and it just began to look more and more like an animal.

'Some of my friends saw it. They just said "wow" - they thought it looked a lot like an animal.

'I didn't want to eat it so I've just kept it.

'Hopefully I will find some more funny looking strawberries but we only have a small pot plant.'

Matthew's discovery came just a few weeks after another keen gardener found a strawberry which resembled a man's penis.

Mother-of-two Carole Collen, 52, from Dartford, Kent, brought it inside to show her family - and then took a photo so her friends could see it.

Ms Collen said: 'When I saw it, I just thought "Oh my God".

'It immediately reminded me of a man's bits and I just had to take a photo.

'At first, I thought a snail must have eaten into it, but it hasn't - it's all natural.

'It's funny how a strawberry can grow like that and my family couldn't stop laughing.

'I must admit though, I did think it was a bit small. It would be nice if it grew a bit bigger.'

Ms Collen, a professional housekeeper, popped the sexy strawberry in her fridge to preserve it for a charity raffle.
