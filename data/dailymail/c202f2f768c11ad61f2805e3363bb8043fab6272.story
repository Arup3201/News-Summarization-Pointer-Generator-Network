An Indiana woman was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2001 death of her 10-week-old daughter whose remains were found in an Arkansas storage unit.

Jurors deliberated about an hour before finding Krissy Lynn Werntz, 34, guilty in the death of her two-month-old daughter, Montana.

Her boyfriend, Jason Hann, 38, became angry that their daughter, Montana, was crying. He struck her in the head and killed her.

Hann has already been sentenced to death for his role in the baby's killing.

Convicted: Krissy Lynn Werntz, 34, has been found guilty in the death of her daughter, Montana, whose decomposed remains were found in an Arkansas storage unit a year after she was killed

Her body was stuffed into a ‘blue Tupperware-type 
plastic container’ and moved away.

The couple kept it in trailers and motorhomes
 for nine months as they moved from state to state living a ‘transient, 
gypsy-style life’ doing odd jobs,

Her decomposed remains were found in an Arkansas storage unit in 2002, a year after she was killed.

The remains were found after the storage unit’s contents were sold because Werntz and her boyfriend Jason Michael Hann failed to pay the bill.

Montana’s remains were kept in a plastic storage container in a trailer in a Arkansas storage unit.

But when Hann and Werntz stopped making payments, the trailer was auctioned off in February 2002 to an Arkansas man, who found the baby’s body.

The person who bought the contents found the child’s body stuffed in a plastic container.

The discovery triggered a nationwide search for Werntz and Hann.

Hann, who was also the baby's father, was convicted of murder last December for inflicting the fatal injuries and was sentenced to death in February.

Werntz sobbed when the verdict was read. She now faces 15 years to life in prison.

Werntz chose a 'gypsy lifestyle' with Hannm, Deputy District Attorney Lisa DiMaria told jurors in her closing argument Monday.

The couple traveled the country with their child, Jason, yet in July 1999 the infact suffered fatal injuries.

Werntz claimed she thought he may have been bitten by a spider. Bizarrely, she didn't call authorities and hid the baby’s remains by keeping them with her.

Less than a year later, the couple had a daughters, Montana.

Before she was even a month old, her leg was 'snapped in half like a twig,' and her mother Werntz ignored what happened.

Montana died in February 2001, and just like last time, Werntz didn’t call for help and concealed the baby from law enforcement.

'The only reasonable interpretation is the defendant was part and parcel of all of this,' prosecutor Di Mario said, telling jurors 'the only way that Montana’s suffering ended was when her parents ended her life.'

'This baby was abused and killed while in the care and custody of the defendant and Hann. Either she co-abused the child, or failed to protect the child,' DiMaria said.

'It was like some twisted, baby-killing Bonnie and Clyde,' she went on.

Hann and Werntz were arrested in April 2002 at a motel in Portland, Maine.

In February 2006, Hann entered a plea of no contest  in Vermont to the boy’s murder.

He was convicted of second-degree murder and was sentenced to 27 to 30 years in prison.

Hann was then brought back to Riverside County and tried for Montana’s murder. In that case he was convicted and sentenced to death.

The following day, police found their son Jason’s remains in a plastic container in a storage unit in Arizona.

Authorities said the couple had trekked around with the boy's body for 18 months.

Hann
 was serving a 27- to 30-year prison sentence for that death when he was
 extradited to California in 2009 to be tried for Montana's death, and 
it took four years for the death-penalty case to make its way through 
the system and into opening arguments.

The couple’s third child, a month-old boy named Michael, who was found to have numerous broken ribs, bleeding under his 
skull and other internal injuries when he was found.

That boy survived and was later adopted by his foster mother.

Werntz faced 15 years to life in prison for her part in Montana’s murder when she is sentenced on June 27.

She was never charged in the death of her first baby boy.
