Condoleezza Rice has said she was stunned when she learned the classified mission to thwart Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions had been leaked to the press.

The former national security adviser to George W. Bush's administration told the trial of ex-CIA case officer Jeffrey Sterling on Thursday that it was one of the most closely held operations during her tenure.

Prosecutors say Sterling told journalist James Risen about the program involving a key Russian asset because he was bitter about his treatment at the agency. 

Defense lawyers however say that the leak could have come from anywhere and that Sterling has faced unfair suspicion because he sued the CIA for racial discrimination.

In testimony Thursday in federal court, the CIA manager testified that more than 90 people knew about the covert operation.

The mission involved using a Russian asset nicknamed 'Merlin' to funnel deliberately flawed nuclear blueprints to Iran.  

In the trial that began on Tuesday, Sterling was accused of unnecessarily exposing one of the agency's top assets.

Sterling, 47, was charged back in 2010 but his trial has been delayed for years, largely due to wrangling over whether Risen could be forced to testify about his dealings with Sterling. 

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court turned aside an appeal from Risen seeking immunity from a trial subpoena on First Amendment grounds. 

Ultimately, though, prosecutors opted against putting Risen on the stand after free-press advocates lobbied Attorney General Eric Holder to avoid a legal showdown that could have ended with the reporter being thrown in jail for contempt of court for refusing to testify about his confidential sources. 

From 1993 until 2002, Sterling was a CIA agent assigned to a classified, clandestine operations. In 2011 he was indicted, accused of leaking defense secrets.

Risen is a Pulitzer award-winning journalist and author of the 2006 book State of War which details the CIA's covert spy war with Iran.

Earlier this week the Justice Department announced revised guidelines for obtaining records from the news media during criminal leak investigations, removing language that news organizations said was ambiguous and requiring additional levels of review before a journalist can be subpoenaed.

The updated policy revises protocols announced last year amid outrage among news organizations over Obama administration tactics.
