A Tinder date ended up violently in Louisiana and a 22-year-old man has been arrested on a rape charge after allegedly attacking a woman he met on the mobile dating app.

Massage therapist Jacob Hirsch Witz was charged with rape after allegedly attacking a woman he met on the dating app Tinder

The woman told the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office this was her first encounter with 'Jake,' a massage therapist and weight trainer she'd met through the app's matching system, WAFB reported.

They set up a rendezvous Saturday evening at her apartment near the Louisiana State University campus.

At first, they talked on the couch. But soon things got heated and the two moved to the bedroom, where they began to make out.

She told police that 'Jake' — later identified as Jacob Hirsch Witz, 22 — started to get handsy, touching her legs and chest.

Each time, she moved his hands away.

Then he became angry, ripping her shorts off and slapping her 'very hard across the face with an open hand,' the Times-Picayune reported.

He ripped her shirt and bra off and raped her while she begged him to stop, she told cops.

The woman said Witz then picked up her phone and deleted all the text messages they exchanged.

He also made her shower while he watched, she said.

'Pretend this did not happen,' he told her, according to The Advocate. 'Don't tell anybody. I did not rape you. I got to get out of here.'

When police found him, Witz refused to 
answer any questions and requested an attorney — even before officers 
told him he was under arrest and read his Miranda Rights, according to WAFB.

Witz was taken to East Baton Rouge Parish Prison and charged with forcible rape. He's being held on $35,000 bail.
