Jackie Stretton will never make a full recovery from the injuries she suffered in the crash in April and she now walks with the aid of a back brace

A judge has launched a stinging attack on the justice system after he was powerless to hand longer sentences to two men who left a young woman crippled in an horrific car crash as they fled from police.

Judge Rodger Hayward-Smith QC, had to sentence prolific offenders Jason Young, 21, and Tyrell O’Donnell, 20, to less than 18 months after they stole a car and fled police in a 100mph chase across two counties, which ended when their Fiat Stilo smashed into Jackie Stretton’s car leaving her severely injured.

Judge Hawyard-Smith, who is bound by strict sentencing guidelines laid down by the government, handed the maximum 
possible sentences of two years each for aggravated vehicle taking but 
both terms were automatically reduced by a third due to the men’s guilty
pleas.

However, he stunned Chelmsford Crown Court, Essex when he said the pair deserved much longer behind bars.

He said: 'You will get out of prison and 
will get your life back but Jackie Stretton will never get over this, 
physically or mentally.

'It is absurd - if I just pass sentence and allow credit for your guilty pleas, because I have to - it will not be enough.

'It is awful. I am stuck with it because of what the law says, and I can’t abide it.

'Jackie Stretton has suffered a very great deal and both defendants are in their twenties with appalling previous records.

'You
deserve, both of you, to go to prison for a very long time and I 
greatly regret that I am restricted in what sentence I can give you 
because of what Parliament has decided.

'You say you are sorry and I hope that you are because the sentence I have passed is nothing like enough.'

Miss Stretton, 25, of Maldon, Essex,
suffered 'appalling injuries' as she broke her back and suffered 
bleeding to her brain in the crash and was left clinging to life in 
hospital.

Her kneecap was also broken and she was airlifted to Queen’s Hospital, Romford, and placed in a drug-induced coma.

She had completed charity marathons and coast-to-coast
adventure races, but will never make a full recovery from the injuries she 
suffered in the crash in April and she now walks with the aid of a back 
brace.

Young and O’Donnell, both from Devon, were both sentenced after they admitted charges of aggravated vehicle taking.

The court heard that O’Donnell was arrested at the scene but Young fled and did not turn himself in to police until five days later.

Law graduate Miss 
Stretton looked on in tears as the two men were sentenced - 18 months 
for the driver of the stolen car O’Donnell, and 16 months for his 
passenger Young.

The pair - who both have a long string of motoring offences - were banned from the roads for five years.

Miss Stretton is no longer able to 
drive, so had to catch the bus from her home to be at court to witness the men
who ruined her life being sentenced.

She said: 'I just feel so relieved that it is over but my life has changed and I won’t get that back.

'I have been told that I may need my kneecap replaced when I reach 50 and I won’t ever get compensated for that.

'I
love my sports but I have not been able to compete and it has also 
affected my relationships with people because I have changed since it 
happened.'

Miss Stretton welcomed the men’s ban from the roads.

She
added: 'I am really happy that they have been disqualified from driving
for five years - that is the bit that is hopefully going to make a 
difference.

'They have so many previous driving offences - their records went on for pages.'

Richard
Stevens, prosecuting, had told the court the men had stolen the Fiat 
from a caravan park in Suffolk at 5.30am on April 5.

Miss Stretton used to compete in gruelling physical competitions - but after the accident will never be able to compete again

The pair headed towards London at incredibly fast speeds - often over 100mph - and at one stage going 80mph in a 30mph residential area.

The car was seen cutting between lanes on the A12 as police followed them.

They finally lost control on a right-hand bend causing a massive crash involving Miss Stretton’s car, a police car and a Porsche on the A414 at Danbury.
