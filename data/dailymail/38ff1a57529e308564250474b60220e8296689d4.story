Rafael Nadal made his long-awaited return to the court on Thursday with victory over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in an exhibiton match in Kazakhstan.

The world No 2 had not played since a fourth-round defeat at Wimbledon in July after injuring his wrist during a training session in Mallorca.

Nadal lost the first set against Tsonga but battled back to win 6-7(2), 6-3, 6-4 in front of a packed crowd in the Kazakh capital of Astana.

The Spaniard later tweeted: 'Happy to be back on court. The best feeling is this one.'

Nadal now travels to China where he will make his competitive return in Beijing next week, followed by the Shanghai Masters.

Despite the layoff of almost three months, Nadal has already booked his place in the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals at London's O2 Arena in November.

Nadal had not played since losing to Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round at Wimbledon on July 1
