Amazon has accused one of the world's leading publishers of taking too big a cut from ebooks at the expense of authors.

The online bookseller said French firm Hachette, which acts for JK Rowling and Ian Rankin, is handing 'too small a portion' of the revenue to authors.

It is the latest blow in a long-running war of words between Amazon and Hachette, the fourth-biggest publisher in the U.S.

Amazon's comments follow reports that it had been demanding 50 per cent of the ebook price as its cut from any sale as part of a shake-up of its policies. 

But writing on its Kindle forum website the company said it was happy with its 30 per cent cut but believed Hachette should take less.

Currently, Hachette takes 45 per cent. That leaves only 25 per cent for the authors.

Under Amazon's new proposals it will no longer carry the whole cost of discounting allowing the price of ebooks to go down, the company claimed.

However authors have dismissed Amazon's claims saying slashing the price of ebooks could devalue their work and accusing the company of 'thuggish behaviour', The Guardian reported.

The dispute has seen Amazon remove pre-orders and slow deliveries for some of Hachette's best-selling authors.

Hachette's biggest names include David Baldacci, David Foster Wallace and JK Rowling's crime alter ego Robert Galbraith.

A post signed by the Amazon books team said: 'Ebooks can and should be less expensive. Keep in mind that books don't just compete against books.

'Books compete against mobile games, television, movies, Facebook, blogs, free news sites and more. If we want a healthy reading culture, we have to work hard to be sure books actually are competitive against these other media types, and a big part of that is working hard to make books less expensive. 

'While we believe 35 per cent should go to the author and 35 per cent to Hachette, the way this would actually work is that we would send 70 per cent of the total revenue to Hachette, and they would decide how much to share with the author.

'We believe Hachette is sharing too small a portion with the author today, but ultimately that is not our call.' 

Ebooks sell for around $15 in the U.S., which Amazon says is too high.

The online retailer is able to reduce that price but only by paying for the discount itself. By allowing bigger discounts and lower prices, it claims it could sell 1.74 times as many copies of the average book.

Quoted in The Guardian, writer Roxana Robinson, the president of America's Authors Guild, said: 'Amazon is using PR to try to sway public opinion.

'I don't feel it is to writers' benefit in the long term to start devaluing the product. Not every book is going to sell that much more if you drop the ebook price. There is not an infinite demand for books.'
