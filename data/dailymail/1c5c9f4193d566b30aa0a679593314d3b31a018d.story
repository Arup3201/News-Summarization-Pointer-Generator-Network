A 28-year-old groom has been formally charged following the wedding-night crash which killed his bride, 25, as they left their reception.

Ryan Quinton had a blood-alcohol level of 0.114, above the legal limit in Georgia of 0.8, when he sped off with new-wife Kali Dobson on the night of December 29.

Quinton swerved to miss a stray dog in the road and lost control of the Pontiac Firebird he was driving.

Dobson wasn't wearing a seat belt, so when the sports car careened off the road she was ejected and it rolled on top of her - crushing her to death.

In addition to losing his wife just hours after getting married, Quinton is now facing criminal charges over her death.

On
 Wednesday Quinton was charged with driving under the influence, 
vehicular homicide, reckless driving and failure to maintain lane.

He was released from jail after posting $25,000 bond.

After the crash, he ran to the road where, with his clothes torn and covered in blood, he flagged down help.

Chris Thomas told Channel 2 that he was driving along Ball Ground Highway when he spotted Quinton wearing a shredded tuxedo and stumbling along the road.

Tragic: Quinton was distraught after the wreck according to witnesses who said he looked 'scared to death'

'His shirt was all torn up and he was 
bleeding,' he said. 'He had blood all over his face and blood coming out
 of his hands and stuff and just looked bad. And it scared me to death.'

He comforted the sobbing man as they waited for emergency responders. He held the Quinton's hands and they prayed together.

'There was nothing that could be done,' Thomas said after returning to the crash site. 'The car was on top of her. You couldn't even see her.'

After the tragedy, distraught friends and family visited the spot where Dobson had lost her life.

'Some bridesmaids showed up and then things got really, really sad and hopeless for a minute,' witness Chris Thomas told Fox5. 'It was horrible all the way around. And tragic.

'Me and my wife were discussing it, and I said, "I bet it was the most beautiful day of her life".

'What
 should have been the greatest, most beautiful day of their lives is the
 end of one and what could very well be something hard for this young 
man to get over. I pray that he will.'

Happier times: A Facebook image shows Dobson's engagement ring. The couple were married December 29

Friends and relatives expressed their heartbreak on Facebook pages and shared photos of the couple grinning and dancing at the reception just hours before the tragedy.

Their wedding photographers, Still Pearl Photography, also shared stunning images of the beautiful bride before her vows and dancing happily with her new husband afterwards.

Patsy Jordan, a Cherokee School Board member, who once worked with Dobson’s mother, told the Marietta Daily Journal that the community is still stunned by the tragedy.

'It’s traumatic,' Jordan said. 'Just to think she just got married and started on her beautiful journey of life and it just ended so suddenly. It was just hard to wrap my brain around something like that.'

Jordan said Dobson, who had sisters and was close to her new sister-in-law, had a beautiful singing voice.

'Our
 thoughts and prayers are with the Dobson and Quinton families,' the 
company wrote on its Facebook page. 'May Kali and the love this 
beautiful couple shared never be forgotten.'
