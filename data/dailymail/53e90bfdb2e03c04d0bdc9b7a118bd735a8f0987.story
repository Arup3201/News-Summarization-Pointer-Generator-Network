Britain's top one per cent are now paying almost 30 per cent of all income tax - despite only earning 10 per cent of all income.

Research shows the share paid by the highest earners, those who make £160,000 a year or more, jumped to almost a third from just 11 per cent when Margaret Thatcher came to power.

It comes a month after government figures last confirmed the rise, crediting the coalition's policies for lower and middle income earners.

The rise since 1979 was revealed in research by the accountancy firm BDO UK for the Sunday Times.

The top one per cent of earners in 1979 paid just 11 per cent of the nation's income tax - despite the highest rate of income tax being set at 83 per cent.

What they pay in proportion to everyone else has risen sharply since then, the paper reported, to a new high of 29.8 per cent this year.

That is despite the super-earners, who number about 300,000 people, accounting for a far smaller 10 per cent of all Britain's income, according to the left-wing think tank The Resolution Foundation.

When it comes to their assets, however, the super-rich are far better off - with the richest 10 per cent owning 44 per cent of the nation's wealth, or at least £437,000 each.

The figures come after Chancellor George Osborne argued those with ‘broadest shoulders must take the biggest burden’.

Low earners have seen their income tax bills cut, with the amount people can earn without getting taxed rising steadily to £10,000. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg wants to raise that further to £10,500.

But the top one per cent of earners, who paid 20.8 per cent of all income tax just ten years ago, have seen the proportion they give to the taxman rise.

It will be welcome news to the coalition, which faced attacks after lowering the top rate of tax from 50 per cent to 45 per cent.

Labour said it was a tax cut for the rich - but Conservatives insisted it would stop the super-wealthy moving their income out of the country altogether.

Jim O'Neill, former chief economist at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, told the Sunday Times: 'I don't have a problem with the fact that those of us who earn more pay so much more tax. I'm not one of those people who complain that the rich are paying too much.

'But I do think there needs to be much greater awareness of the fact that the same people politicians like to bash to win votes are contributing an awful lot to Britain's public services.'
