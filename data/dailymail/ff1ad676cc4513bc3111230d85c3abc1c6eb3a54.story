Tyson Fury put tape over his mouth to ensure that he gave the first silent press conference in the loud mouthed history of boxing.

So determined was the giant 26-year-old not to cause further of fence in the build-up to his heavwyeight battle of Britain with Dereck Chisora that he uttered not one word as the two came face to face in London.

Fury has been fined £15,000 by the British Boxing Board of Control for the four-letter outburst at their previous head-to-head confrontation.

Tyson Fury taped up his mouth and wouldn't speak to the press ahead of his fight with Dereck Chisora

The boxer let his uncle and trainer Peter Fury talk on his behalf during the press conference 

Peter Fury, his uncle and trainer, did have something to say: 'The Board wanted us to tone it down a bit so here's Tyson... the Board dummy.'

Fury was prepared to respond to questions with gestures and indicated that he will knockout Chisora in one or two rounds at the ExCeL arena in London's Docklands on November 29.

That is the rescheduled date for a world title eliminator which was postponed when Chisora cracked his hand in sparring.

Fury, who had the initial letters BBBC written on his mouth tape, stripped off his shirt to reveal a torso well-honed with the fight still two months away.

When asked if he would maintain his vow of silence throughout those eight weeks he nodded in the affirmative.

Muhammad Ali – not only the greatest but the most voluble of all boxers - famously taped over his mouth after being pilloried for speaking too much. 

He ripped away the gag after a few minutes, unable to contain himself any longer.

Fury promised to maintain his silence until the fight but was happy to use gestures to show his feelings

Dereck Chisora will take on Fury in six weeks and promised to knock the silent fighter out

Promoter Mick Hennessy made it clear how seriously the Board viewed Fury's previous rant when he said: 'This fight could be in jeopardy. If anything else happened, we could be looking at a year's ban.'

Frank Warren, the lead promoter, made his own apology for the outrageous uproar which went before when he said: 'I should have controlled that press conference better. I hold my hands up. I share some of the blame for what went on. Fortunately there was nothing physical.'

Peter Fury and Hennessy revealed that they were upset at being excluded from the Board of Control hearing.

Fury was fined £15,000 for his four-letter outburst when the pair last came face to face this year

Hennessy said: 'We need characters in boxing. Sometimes Tyson is the gentleman but on other occasions he gets rubbed up the wrong way and he should be allowed to express himself.'

The irony, of course, is that this impersonation of Marcel Marceau will generate as much publicity as his wild misconduct has done hitherto.

Chisora was in a mellow mood but when it was drawn to his attention that Fury was indicating with his fingers a first or second round stoppage, he said simply: 'I will knock him out.'

Boxing now holds its breath, waiting to see if Tyson will be able to hold his peace until the end of November. 

Fury and Chisora were sharing a stage together for the first time since their fight was postponed this summer

Tyson Fury v Dereck Chisora will be live on BoxNation on Saturday 29 November.
