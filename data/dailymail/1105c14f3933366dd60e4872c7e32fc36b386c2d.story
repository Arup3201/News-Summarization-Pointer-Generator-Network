Two centuries after his death, the descendants of the notorious Marquis de Sade have finally embraced their once-reviled relative.

The French aristocrat scandalised his contemporaries with his erotic works which saw him locked in prisons and an insane asylum for 32 years.

Now, the eldest member of the dynasty, Elzear de Sade, has said the family are no longer ashamed of their controversial ancestor and has reclaimed the title of marquis which has not been used since his  1814.

He told The Times: 'The family cut all ties with him after his death and when anyone asked, they would say they had nothing to do with him, pretending they were form another branch.

'Today we are united and proud of our name. It is not at all difficult for us to carry.'

Marquis de Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom, written while Bastille, remains one of the most shocking tales of sexual extremism ever published – and often banned for its graphic depiction of the rape and torture of young victims.

He went onto write Justine, or The Misfortunes of Justice, which was described by Napoleon Bonaparte as the 'most abominable book ever engendered'.

The libertine's controversial work saw him locked up for 32 years of his life in prisons and an insane asylum.

De Sade's name even gave rise to the words sadism and sadomasochism.

For  200 years, his family hid all links with the revolutionary philosopher and writer.

But on the bicentenary of his death, de Sade's controversial work, much of which has been translated into many languages and even studied in some French literature degrees, has been celebrated.

His original 39-ft scroll of The 120 Days of Sodom has also gone on display at the Museum of Letters and Manuscripts in Paris.

He wrote the masterpiece, about the depraved behaviour of four wealthy French libertines who rape, torture and finally murder their victims in a remote mediaeval castle, in just 37 days during his imprisonment for sexual deviancy and blasphemy in 1785.

It was found when the Bastille prison was stormed during the French Revolution.

Paris' Orsay museum has devoted an exhibition to de Sade to show his influence on great artists throughout history, including Pablo Picasso and Francisco de Goya.

Curator Annie le Brun said she had been 'amazed' by de Sade's intelligence and called his exploration of 'desire and the violence of desire'  a landmark in European literature.

The current Marquis' parents, Xavier and Rose de Sade, had been the first to allow researchers into the family library after the Second World War to try and break the taboo around the notorious writer.

Elzear de Sade said he found the exhibitions of the Marquis de Sade's life and work 'totally agreeable.'

'A lot of people, writers and philosophers are very happy to show who Sade really was,'  added Elzear who claims his ancestor had never actually taken part in debauchery he wrote about.

'He was a writer and a thinker, not a sinner,' he said. 

De Sade, was reviled by contemporaries, is portrayed in 'Correspondence de Madame Gourdan' by Marquis de Sade

Marquis de Sade (Donatien de Sade) was born into an aristocratic Provençal family in 1740. 

A sexual libertine, revolutionary politician and writer, he is best known for his scandalous works, which featured rape, paedophilia, bestiality, torture and necrophilia.

The Marquis'  name even forms the root of the word 'sadism' and sadomasochism.

He managed to keep his head through the French Revolution and died, aged 74, in a lunatic asylum.

His works meant he had also spent much of his life incarcerated.

He acquired his notoriety through Justine, or The Misfortunes of Justice.

Published in 1791, it was described by Napoleon Bonaparte as the 'most abominable book ever engendered'.

He had written The 120 Days of Sodom six years before, penned in just 37 days in Bastille in 1785. 

After his death, he began to become a hero to writers and artists who celebrated him as a philosopher worthy of debate.
