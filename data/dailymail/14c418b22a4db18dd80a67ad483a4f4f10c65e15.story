Anthony Crolla's neighbour has paid tribute to the boxer after he was seriously injured following an altercation with two intruders on Tuesday night.

Crolla saw the burglars inside Craig Townsend's house in New Moston and confronted them, only to be hit over the head with a concrete slab.

He was taken to hospital in Oldham with a fractured skull and a broken ankle.

Crolla noticed Townsend's alarm was going off when he returned home and saw shadows inside.

He chased the pair before he was attacked and left bleeding heavily.

Townsend told the Manchester Evening News: 'I text him last night to thank him and say sorry for everything.

'And he replied saying, "Don't worry about it, we're neighbours, we look after each other". 

Crolla was due to fight Richar Abril for the WBA lightweight title next month but that has been shelved

'His attitude just says everything about him, he's just a great guy.'

Crolla's world title fight against WBA lightweight champion Richar Abril on January 23 has been postponed.

He required surgery on his ankle but his trainer Joe Gallagher said he was 'lucky to be alive'.
