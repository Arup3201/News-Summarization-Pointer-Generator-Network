Muhammad Ali was released from hospital on Friday ahead of his 73th birthday celebrations

Muhammad Ali has been released from hospital and is in good spirits ahead of his birthday on Saturday.

A spokesman for the champion boxer said that he 'looks forward to celebrating his 73rd birthday tomorrow'.

Ali had been admitted to hospital for the second time in four weeks after he was found in an unresponsive state by guests staying at his Scottsdale, Arizona home.

The former champion boxer needed follow-up care related to the severe urinary tract infection he was hospitalized with on December 20. 

'There were still issues with the urinary tract infection,' spokesman Bob Gunnell said of Ali's latest hospitalization.

The three-time world heavyweight champion was now heading home to celebrate his 73rd birthday on January 17 with his family and friends. 

'My daddy is a strong man. He's so resilient and we're all very grateful and blessed,' daughter Rasheda Ali-Walsh, one of his nine children, said earlier this week.  

Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, was diagnosed with the brain disease about three years after he retired from boxing in 1981.

Ali's public appearances have diminished in recent years as he continues to battle Parkinson's disease, but he still enjoys getting out and watching sports and visiting friends. 

Ali appeared in public in September at a ceremony in his hometown of Louisville for the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards. 

He did not speak to the crowd but posed for photos with award winners, including former NFL great Jim Brown.

Brown leaned over and whispered to the seated Ali during the photo session. Later, Brown said he told Ali: 'You're the greatest of all time.' 

Ali and his wife, Lonnie, have homes in Paradise Valley, Arizona; Berrien Springs, Michigan; and in Louisville.

Ali's daughter Rasheda Ali-Walsh, one of his nine children, told TMZ in November that her father was being treated at a hospital in his home state of Kentucky
