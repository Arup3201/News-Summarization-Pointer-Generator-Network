A group of students who were on a field trip to a zoo in Texas allegedly broke into several exhibits and harassed zoo animals.

The Houston Zoo is investigating the allegations after they discovered posts on Twitter concerning the accusations, as well as a photograph of a student attempting to touch a jaguar inside of the animal's pit that surfaced last week.

Several users on Twitter reportedly claimed the image of the student from the field trip last Friday in the jaguar cage is a freshman who attends Magnolia High School, according to Click 2 Houston.

Twitter users also alleged that students jumped into the elephant cage and broke into the bird exhibit plucking feathers off wild birds.

On Monday, the principal of Magnolia High School issued an apology to the Houston Zoo for the behavior of students.

Jeff Springer said: 'I would like to sincerely apologize to the Houston Zoo for the behavior exhibited by some of our students during a recent field trip. 

'As the principal of Magnolia High School, I am not only embarrassed but extremely disappointed in the actions of our students.

'I take full responsibility and want to do what is necessary to mend the relationship that has been tarnished with the Houston Zoo.'

Houston Zoo has not come forward stating exactly what the students did while on the field trip to the zoo, but officials said if the allegations are true, the students responsible will not be allowed to return.

The zoo also said the safety of their animals, employees and guests is its number one priority and also that harassing animals is against zoo policy as well as against the law in many cases.

Several students from Magnolia High School have shared their frustration with the actions of their classmates during the field trip with one posting 'reason 719 I hate the freshman class'.

Another student wrote: 'MHS...where we get banned from Houston Zoo for touching deadly animals, slapping elephants and plucking wild birds.'

The school has already made an announcement to students telling them there will no longer be field trips taken to the zoo.

The investigation is ongoing.
