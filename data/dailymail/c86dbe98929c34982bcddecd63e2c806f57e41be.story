The father of the American student horrifically gored by a bull during the annual event in Pamplona has revealed he specifically told his son not to participate in the iconic run.

Describing his son as 'romantic', Vince Eccles said that he was stunned to receive a phone call at 4 a.m. on Friday from the hospital informing him that his son, Patrick, had defied him.

'It's something we had told him not do,' said Eccles from his home in Salt Lake City as he revealed that his son is recovering well in Navarra - despite losing his spleen when the bull's horn pierced his abdominal cavity.Scroll down for video

Agony: Patrick Eccles, a 20-year-old American, was gored in the stomach on Friday during the annual Running of the Bulls in Pamplona

University of Utah student Patrick Eccles, 20, was one of three people who were injured on Friday during the iconic bull-run in Spain - one man was pinned to the ground and gored three times, once in the groin, knee and thigh.

Warning: Vince Eccles (center) first learned that his son had participated in the Running of the Bulls in Spain when he got a phone call at 4 a.m. Friday informing him that his son was in the hospital

Vince Eccles told the Deseretnews.com that so far he has not seen any video of his son being injured, but that he had seen the disturbing and graphic photographs.

Eccles tod the Deseret News that the pictures made him 'hurt for him more'.

Despite his sons close call, Vince Eccles said that Patrick was able to speak to him by telephone from his hospital bed.

'He said he felt fine after the surgery,' said Vince Eccles.

Speaking of his shock that his son participated in the event, Vince Eccles said that 'He's a serious student and maybe a romantic.'

Patrick Eccles was valedictorian of his graduating class at Logan High School in Utah, played on the football and soccer teams and was on the student council.

Patrick Eccles was in Barcelona for an internship with a computer company working on Android apps. He was enjoying living with other students and learning a new language and culture.

Doctors have yet to decide whether he will be well enough to fly home this week - or if Patrick Eccles will have to remain in Spain to recover.

A 20-year-old University of Utah student has been revealed today as the American tourist gored by a bull during the famous Spanish Running of the Bulls festival in Pamplona.

Last week, horrifying pictures showed the American tourist, dressed in traditional white with a red scarf, being pierced in the stomach by a bull's horn as he screams in pain.

Vicious: Mr Eccles winces in pain as he is gored by a bull - six people in total were taken to hospital after today's run

Tourist trap: Eccles, right, was studying abroad in Spain when he decided to take part in the annual Running of the Bulls

Mr Eccles was studying abroad in Spain but not as part of a university program, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

According to the Utah University's website graduated from Logan High School where he was a member of the football team.

He was rushed to Navarra Hospital where doctor's discovered that the bull's horn had pierced his abdominal cavity and punctured the organ. His condition was reported as stable.

Mr Eccles and a second American, aged 48 and
thought to have suffered head injuries, were both in hospital.

Six people in total were taken to hospital after today's run, the sixth of eight.

The
gorings were the first of this year's festival, in which just 15 
runners had been taken to hospital over the first five days.

A 42-year-old Spaniard also had his arm punctured on Friday but the most terrifying moments occurred when a lone bull became separated from the pack and attacked a second Spanish runner as he lay helpless on the ground after being mown down by the animal and tripping in front of it.

The half-ton beast gored the 31-year-old twice in the groin and once in the leg.

Off on an adventure: Eccles has posted various pictures during his trip abroad including his 'trail-running flip-flops'

Dramatic TV pictures showed him being lifted in the air on the animal's horns with his trousers round his ankles.

Other
runners tried to distract the animal by grabbing its tail and waving 
newspapers at it. But a friend was only able to drag him away after more
than half a minute of terror.

The
injured man, from the eastern Spanish province of Castellon between 
Barcelona and Alicante, was undergoing an emergency operation this 
morning.

His condition was described as 'serious.'

Tradition: Revelers from around the world arrive to Pamplona every year to take part on some of the eight days of the running of the bulls

They included gas firm worker John 
Bennett, 44, from Wolverhampton in the UK, who suffered knee injuries on the first
run on Sunday after being trampled on by other runners as he fell near 
the end of the course.

Fifteen
people have been killed at the annual festival, made famous by a 1926 
Ernest Hemingway novel, since records began in 1911.

Between 200 to 300 people are usually injured each year.

The most recent death was in 2009 when 27-year-old Daniel Jimeno, from Madrid, was gored in the neck by a bull called Capuchino.

The
event has become increasingly popular with foreigners, who join the 
locals by staying up all night drinking and partying before thousands 
compete in the 8am run.

Pamplona's population of 200,000 swells to around two million during the festival, the largest in Spain.

After each morning run, the animals are killed in an afternoon bullfight.

Around 3,500 thrill-seekers compete in the most popular weekend runs with 2,000 taking part during the week.

Annual event: Fifteen people have been killed at the annual festival, made famous by a 1926 Ernest Hemingway novel, since records began in 1911

Aggression: An 'El Pilar' fighting bull charges against a reveler

Count: Hospital authorities initially said four people were gored but the regional government revised that down to three

Fail: The woman does not succeed as she runs ahead while the bull makes contact

Sport: A young woman tries to outrun a bull at the close of the running-with-the-bulls in the old city of Pamplona

Duration: Today's event lasted just under five minutes, roughly double the normal length. Longer runs normally occur when some of the bulls get separated from the pack and become disoriented and more dangerous

The black bull which caused most panic Friday made several more attempts to charge people before he was eventually guided along the narrow streets to join the rest for the pack in the pen of the packed bull ring

Legend: Ernest Hemingway popularized the week-long fiesta in his book The Sun Also Rises in 1926

Deaths: The fighting bulls used in the centuries-old fiesta can weigh up to at 1,380 pounds (625 kilograms) and have killed 15 people since record-keeping began in 1924
