Russian politicians and media were last night demanding Vladimir Putin goes further by grabbing back more former Soviet regions and states.

The nationalistic frenzy whipped up by the return of Crimea - in defiance of the West - has led to calls on state-run TV for Moscow to take back oil and gas-rich Kazakhstan and authoritarian Belarus as well as more slices of a battered Ukraine, already filleted by the Kremlin.

Putin was last night riding the crest of an adulatory wave after righting what many Russians see as an historical wrong and reintegrating Crimea and the Black Sea fleet headquarters of Sevastopol back in to Russia after a gap of 60 years.

Senior politicians openly mocked Western sanctions and discounted Putin's assertion that he did not seek more of Ukraine as long as the West stops seeking sway in his backyard.

The Russian strongman defiantly told a joint session of the Russian parliament that he would not accept NATO 'next to our home or on our historic territories'.

Accusing the West of hypocrisy in pushing for self-determination for Kosovo but denying Crimea, he said the peninsula had been 'robbed' from Russia in Soviet times while 'regions of Russia's historic south' were only now Ukrainian because of a Bolshevik blunder.

In an emotional and historic address he said: 'In the hearts and minds of people, Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of Russia.'

Putin has succeeded in uniting many of his foes behind him but last night it also appeared he had unleashed a tidal wave in favour of more land grabs.

Senior politician Sergei Mironov hailed 'the great day when the gathering of Russian lands began'.

Sergey Zheleznyak, deputy chairman of lower house, demanded Russian 'support' for other Ukrainian regions.

'We cannot feel calm and happy as long as we realise how our brothers in other regions of Ukraine are suffering,' he said.

A prime time TV talk show speculated about restoring the sovereign states of Belarus and energy-rich Kazakhstan in a substantial remaking of the Soviet Union, while also calling for the historically Russian cities of Donetsk and Odessa in Ukraine to be returned.

Meanwhile a campaign was underway for the breakaway republic of Transdniestria - in Moldova - to follow Crimea back into the embrace of the Russian bear.

With some parliamentarians in tears during Putin's historic speech - when he officially welcomed Crimea and Sevastopol back to Russia - only his prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, caught napping during the barnstorming address, failed to join the patriotic fervour punctuated by standing ovations.

Politicians queued up to pour scorn on Western sanctions with deputy speaker Sergey Zheleznyak branding them a 'kindergarten measure' and close Putin ally Igor Sechin accusing the U.S. and EU of 'hysteria'.

Stage-managed patriotic celebrations were marked across Russia's nine time zones yesterday.

In Moscow, residents were urged by officials to fly Russian flags from their balconies to 'celebrate' the return of Crimea.

Ukraine watched helplessly as Putin and Crimean leaders penned an agreement restoring the territory to Russia.

Senior diplomat Yevhen Perebyynis warned: 'What has made the entire world shudder is the real rebirth of Russian imperialism, for which nothing is sacred, neither internationally recognised borders of sovereign states, nor the rights and freedoms of citizens, nor international obligations.'

Kiev protested that the move 'has nothing in common with law or democracy or common sense'.

But in a warning to the world, the country's foreign ministry said: 'Putin's address very clearly demonstrates just how real the threat is that Russia poses to international security and international security.'

Ukrainian volunteers were queuing to sign up for a newly-created National Guard amid fears that the threat of invasion from Russia remains, or that Putin will use alleged 'saboteurs' to spark riots and political protests in major cities.

Kiev claimed it had uncovered 'convincing evidence of the participation of Russian special services in organizing unrest in the east of our country.'

Last night it was claimed a Ukrainian naval officer was shot twice in the leg seeking to defend a naval facility from pro-Moscow attack in Crimea.

But Putin insisted: 'The residents of Crimea and Sevastopol turned to Russia with a request to protect their rights and their lives. We could not have rejected their appeal and left them in trouble.'

He complained that the fall of the USSR left Russia 'the biggest divided nations in the world' with millions of compatriots waking up in a foreign country.

In Ukraine, ethnic Russians were undergoing 'forced assimilation' in a country where 'neo-Nazis' played a key role in decision making.

Western diplomats saw him as using rhetoric which could act as justification for future military adventures to restore other areas of the old USSR.

But Putin told Western leaders to 'stop the hysteria' and respect his country's national interests. 'They keep trying to drive us into a corner', and could have grabbed Sevastopol for themselves.

NATO members 'are great guys, but it's better for them to come visit us in Sevastopol, than for us to visit them there'.

Crimean clocks are to be switched back two hours later this month, so they tick by Moscow time. Putin ordered three official languages in his new province - Russian, Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar.

The Kremlin last night began pouring roubles into Crimea but was eyeing the seizure of 20 warships in the Ukrainian navy which are stranded here.

Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev - often seen as a Putin critic - hailed Crimea's vote to join Russia as a 'happy event.'
