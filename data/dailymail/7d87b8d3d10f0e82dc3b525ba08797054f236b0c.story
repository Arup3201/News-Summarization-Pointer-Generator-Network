Broken bones and bruises were order of the day today when hundreds of people took part in cheese rolling - while it emerged that the winner of the traditional event doesn't even like cheese.

Several runners were injured during the annual Gloucestershire affair, where revellers hurtled down a 200-yard hill in a bid to become the first to catch a rolling wheel of cheese - including one man who broke his collarbone and another who snapped his wrist.

Dozens of the runners also suffered cuts, scrapes and bruises after the treacherous run, and one young man suffered a suspected dislocated shoulder and a woman is thought to have broken her ankle.

Rough and tumble: Dozens of competitors take part in the traditional 
cheese rolling event at Coopers Hill, Gloucester with many speeding down
 the hill

Bizarre: The event has been staged since 
the 1800s but since 2009 it has been held unofficially because of 
spiralling insurance costs and health and safety fears

Crazy: There is no official medical cover and 
those taking part are told it is up to the individual whether they want 
to chase the cheese - but many took the risk

The annual event was held at Cooper’s 
Hill in Brockworth, Gloucester, today and the main race was won by local
 man Josh Shepherd.

The 
19-year-old, from Brockworth, said: 'It was really good. I’m over the 
moon - it’s thrilling to win an event I’ve grown up watching.'

As well as the pride of his village, Josh has also won the 8lb wheel of Double Gloucester cheese to take home and eat.

Ryan Fairley, 24, won one of the races for the second year in a row, and walked away with the prize - despite not liking cheese.

On
 the last event of the day, which saw a hundred people hurtle down the 
slope, one young man suffered a nasty fall and appeared to have badly 
broken his left leg.

Unsafe? A reveller takes a tumble in a tiger onesie. Last year, Rob Seex, who set the cheese 
rolling down the famous hill from 1990 until 2009, said that the costs mean 
it will probably never be organised as an official event again

Winded: It takes a man to chase a cheese down a hill. Only the strongest survive the Double Gloucester cheese run but at least this man hurt nothing more than his pride

Champion! 17-year-old hairdressing student Lucy Townsend won the women's race while this man may have cuts and a bandaged thumb but at least he finished 

An ambulance was called to the foot of the hill as the screaming man was carried halfway down the steep slope.

An onlooker said: 'It really looked quite bad. He was in a lot of pain. You could really tell it was broken. It just looked wrong, like his foot was in the wrong place.'

Police road closures meant that onlookers had to walk more than two miles to get to the hill.

An onlooker said: 'It’s great keeping local traditions alive, and the thousands of people here just goes to show that we want the right to roll cheeses whenever, and wherever, we want.

'The police were a joke, making us park miles away. But nothing will stop cheese-rolling.

'Even last year when we didn’t have any cheese, the event went ahead.'

Top girl: 17-year-old hairdressing student Lucy Townsend, from Brockworth, won the Women's Downhill race for the third year running showing she is a top athlete

Celebrate: Revellers cheer as they reach the bottom of the hill. In total, four cheeses weighing around 
three kilograms each and three smaller ones, weighing around 
one-and-a-half kilograms, were used in the event, which had a women’s 
race and a children’s event

Speedy: The event saw runners hurtle down the steep slippery slope, chasing after 
the rolling cheese

Last year, the cheese-rolling even used a
 fake Double Gloucester made of wood when cheesemaker Diana Smart, 87,
 was banned by police from providing a wheel

The event has been staged since the 1800s but from 2009 it has been held unofficially because of spiralling insurance costs and health and safety fears. Organisers said that it could cost more than £250,000 to insure.

Last year, Rob Seex, who set the cheese rolling down the famous hill from 1990 until 2009, lamented that the costs mean it will probably never be organised as an official event again.

There is no official medical cover and those taking part are told it is up to the individual whether they want to chase the cheese.

The event saw runners reach high speeds as they hurtled down the steep slippery slope, chasing after the rolling cheese.

Last year, the cheese-rolling even used a fake Double Gloucester made from wood when cheesemaker Diana Smart, 87, was banned by police from providing a wheel for the event.

Mrs Smart made all seven wheels of Double Gloucester for this year’s event.

She said: 'I’ve always thought it was something worthwhile doing. I think it’s a good thing. It was a great shame they felt they had to stop it.'

In total, four cheeses weighing around three kilograms each and three smaller ones, weighing around one-and-a-half kilograms, were used in the event, which had a women’s race and a children’s event.

A Dutch contingent of cheese makers gathered on the hill with wheels of Gouda they had generously brought for the event, in case there were any difficulties with the Double Gloucester.

In 2013, the event was won by American army veteran Kenny Rackers, then aged 27, and injuries included a broken leg.

The event was cancelled in 2011 after organisers said they had been threatened with violence after plans to sell tickets costing £20 for a two-day event were announced.

A spokesman for Great Western Ambulance said they were not involved in the event, and St John Ambulance declined to comment, as they too were uninvolved.
