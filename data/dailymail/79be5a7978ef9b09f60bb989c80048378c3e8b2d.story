A U.S. naval drone has been found floating off the coast of the Philippines - hundreds of miles away from the nearest American military base.

The fishermen who found the 10ft orange device originally reported that it could have been a bomb, prompting local officials to send munitions experts out into the sea.

But when it was determined to be safe, the unmanned aerial vehicle was taken into the care of the Filipino navy.

Found: This U.S. naval drone has been discovered floating in the waters off Masbate in the Philippines

Mystery: It is unclear how the military device ended up so far from any American base

The BQM-74E drone, marked 'Navy', was found by a diver and fishermen on Sunday off the coast of Masbate Island, towards the centre of the island chain.

A Filipino naval officer said officials did not know how the UAV ended up near the island, more than 200 miles from the capital Manila.

The drones are frequently used by the U.S. military as targets during training exercises and weapons testing.

Recovery: Filipino fishermen bringing in the unmanned aerial vehicle on a boat on Sunday

Target: This type of drone is used in military drills and weapons testing rather than for combat or surveillance

Location: Masbate is in the middle of the island chain and has been plagued with communist guerrillas

A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Manila said officials were trying to work out whether the one which was found near Masbate had in fact been used by the Navy.

She added that the drone was not armed and had not been used for surveillance.

While the Philippines used to host multiple U.S. military bases, the American naval facility in the country was shut down more than two decades ago.

The nearest U.S. Navy base to Masbate is the facility in the Japanese province of Okinawa, around 1,000 miles away.

Taken: The device is now being looked after by the Filipino navy

Far off: The nearest U.S. naval base is in Okinawa in Japan, around 1,000 miles away

Masbate is in a region which has frequently been plagued by communist guerillas.

U.S. counterterrorism troops are banned from operating on the ground in the country, but have used surveillance drones to help Filipino forces track down jihadists with links to Al Qaeda.

At least two U.S. drones have apparently been taken by villagers after crashing on the island of Mindanao.
