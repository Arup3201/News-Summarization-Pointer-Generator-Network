Liberal Democrat MP Lorely Burt has provoked anger among her constituents after she omitted the word 'Christmas' from her annual card in favour of the message 'Happy Holidays'.

Residents accused the Liberal Democrat politician of being politically correct and unBritish, forcing Mrs Burt to issue an apology.

Constituent Aminah Mehboob said: 'I am shocked that she has employed an obviously American phrase, rather than a more British greeting.'

Lorely Burt's Christmas card which has been criticised for saying Happy Holidays and for being overly politically correct.

Lorely Burt, the Solihull MP, has come under fire from constituents for her Christmas card which said 'Happy Holidays'

One pensioner told The Birmingham Mail: “I feel offended. In my 66 years of living in this country, it is the first time I’ve seen our traditional Christmas card abandoned. I wonder which tradition we will be losing next.”

Mrs Burt has apologised for her decision to wish local residents ‘Happy Holidays’ - a seasonal Christmas greeting preferred by Americans.

She said: “I am sorry if my Christmas card offended anyone, and I look forward to continuing to fight for improved local services in the New Year.

'I have no hesitation in wishing all my constituents a very Merry Christmas.'

Winterval was the name given to Christmas festivities in 1997 and 1998 by Birmingham council to reflect the diverse nature of the city's population.

At the time the council said it was making the change to create a more welcoming, multi-cultural atmosphere due to the large proportion of ethnic groups.

However, the move was widely criticised.  The Bishop of Birmingham, the Rt Rev Mark Santer, said it was political correctness gone mad, adding: 'I confess I laughed out loud when our city council came out with Winterval as a way of not talking about Christmas.'

Resident Adam Higgs complained: ‘She may as well have wished her constituents a Merry Winterval since that is the name Birmingham City Council once used to seemingly marginalise use of the word Christmas.’

‘I would wish those who celebrate them a Happy Diwali, Hanukkah, Eid, Chinese New Year, to name a few celebrations, not Happy Holidays. Of course, unlike Lorely, I have no problem in wishing all a Merry Christmas,’ he said. 

The row harks back to the Winterval 
furore in Birmingham in the 1990s, a season of public events over 
Christmas organised by the city council - a move widely considered 
politically correct so as not to offend non-Christians

Julian Knight, the Conservative Solihull candidate said the card was a “nonsense” and that several people had contacted him to complain.

He said: ‘No one can be offended by being wished a Merry or Happy Christmas. It is a Christian festival and those of other faiths, welcome it as such.’

'This politically correct, treading on eggshells approach doesn't do anyone any favours. We should wish each other a Merry Christmas and be proud.'

The greeting 'Happy Holidays' may seem out of place in Britain to some, but in the US the saying has been around for decades.

Some say it dates back to the turn of the century, but more probably it came from the Irving Berlin song 'Happy Holidays' released for the 1942 film Holiday Inn.

And it seems the greeting is gaining popularity in the US. A recent poll by the Public Religion Research Institute found that nearly half of Americans thought shops and companies should greet customers with a 'Happy Holidays' or 'Seasons Greetings' instead of 'Merry Christmas.' This compares to 2010 when 44 per cent of Americans preferred holiday neutral greetings.

Politically, opinion is divided over the use of 'Happy Holidays' in the US. Over 60 per cent of Republicans favour using 'Merry Christmas' instead of 'Happy Holidays', while 58 percent of Democrats say the opposite, the poll showed.

In addition, about two-thirds of young adults, aged 18-29, 
support shops using a non-religious greeting.
