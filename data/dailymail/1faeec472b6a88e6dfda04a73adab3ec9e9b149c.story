Serena Williams has issued a new apology for what she called 'insensitive and misinformed comments' she made about the victim in the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case.

In a Rolling Stone story posted online last week, Williams said the 16-year-old girl 'shouldn't have put herself in that position.'

On Monday night, a before Williams her first-round match at Wimbledon, 
she released another statement on her website, saying she also wanted to
'extend an apology to the millions of sexual assault victims in America
whose pain could have been compounded by my inappropriate remarks.'

Serena speaks: During a press conference, Williams made her first apologies for the comments she made about the Steubenville rape case in a Rolling Stone interview

Williams said in the interview,Â  'Do you think it was fair, what they got? They did something stupid, but I don't know. 
I'm not blaming the girl, but if you're a 16-year-old and you're drunk 
like that, your parents should teach you - don't take drinks from other 
people.'

'She's 16, why was she that drunk where she doesn't remember? It could have been much worse,' WIlliams added.

'She's lucky. Obviously I don't know, maybe she wasn't a virgin, but she shouldn't have put herself in that position, unless they slipped her something, then that's different.'

Her comments caused a storm of controversy, with many upset that a woman in Williams' position would blame the teenage victim for the rape. Williams claimed on that Rolling Stone misquoted her.

'I am currently reaching out to the girl's family to let her know that I am deeply sorry for what was written in the Rolling Stone article,' she said.

'What was written - what I supposedly said - is insensitive and hurtful, and I by no means would say or insinuate that she was at all to blame.'

Stick to what you know: Serena Williams is likely to be more 
successful on court at Wimbledon than commenting on current affairs such
as Steubenville rapists Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond (right)

Williams also apologized at a news conference for the comments.

The new apology reads:

'I am deeply sorry for my insensitive and misinformed comments. It was not my intention to cause the victim and her family any additional pain. But I did, and I am sorry. I am grateful to them for the opportunity to personally apologize, and I am humbled by their strength, grace, and forgiveness.'I also want to extend an apology to the millions of sexual assault victims in America whose pain could have been compounded by my inappropriate remarks. Rape and all forms of sexual assault are completely unacceptable, no matter the circumstances.'

Sexual assault, Williams wrote, 'is never acceptable and never the fault of the victim.'
