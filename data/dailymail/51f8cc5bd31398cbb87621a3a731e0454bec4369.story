Money worries: Clive Joy was once worth £69million but is now claiming to have 80,000 euros, or £65,000, left in the bank - and facing huge legal costs

An aviation tycoon and his wife embroiled in a multi-million pound divorce have been driven to fight over a £470,000 vintage Bentley, which each hopes will fund their huge legal bills.

Clive Joy, 55, whose fortune was once put at £69million, is now ‘pleading poverty’ in defending a massive financial claim by the mother of his three children, Nichola Joy, a senior judge has heard.

But Mrs Joy, 47, says he is claiming to be ‘penniless’ as ‘part of a dishonest strategy’ to reduce any financial award she may receive by hiding his fortune in an offshore trust.

Now, they are fighting in the British courts over a 1928 4.5litre Bentley Tourer, valued at £472,000, which is parked at Chateau Tournefort, their palatial house in Provence.

Martin Pointer QC, for Mr Joy, told Appeal Court judge Lord Justice Patten that the entrepreneur is caught in legal tangles on both sides of the channel – and his cash reserves have fallen to £66,000.

The couple met in April 2001 and married five years later. Mrs Joy petitioned for divorce in July 2011, the court heard. A decree nisi was pronounced in June last year, but the divorce has yet to be finalised while the couple run up enormous legal bills squabbling over the partition of their assets.

Zimbabwe-born Mr Joy attended university in England and has lived with his family for spells in the Caribbean and in France.

He made his fortune through a phenomenally successful aircraft leasing firm. Mr Pointer said that Mr Joy moved the money made from this venture into a trust in 2002.

His wife’s lawyers say he transferred
 about £69million to the British Virgin Islands-based trust. But Mr 
Pointer said the family’s living expenses were funded by drawing cash 
from a bank loan, secured against the trust.

As
 of June last year, Mr Joy had withdrawn £18million in this way. Last 
May, Mrs Joy got a worldwide order freezing £35million of her 
ex-husband’s assets and Mr Pointer said that had ‘catastrophic 
ramifications for this family’s finances’.

Mr
 Pointer said Mr Joy has since been unable to borrow against the trust’s
 assets and it prompted the bank to order the £18million he withdrew be 
repaid.

When the freezing 
order was lifted last November, Mr Pointer said the bank was ‘determined
 not to reinstate the loan facility’ and continued to pursue payment of 
the debt – leaving Mr Joy with £66,000 in cash.

Mr
 Pointer said Mr Joy agreed last November that his lawyers could take a 
legal charge over the Bentley as collateral for their fees.

In
 January, a High Court judge ordered the Bentley’s return to England so 
that it could serve as security for Mrs Joy’s legal costs.

But
 Mr Joy is appealing against that ruling and Mr Pointer said he ‘really 
is better off leaving the car where it is’ until that case is heard. He 
added that the car is in any event currently subject to a French court 
order, preventing its removal from the Chateau.

Lord
 Justice Patten ruled in favour of Mrs Joy, adding that he did not want 
to make an order which makes it more difficult for the car to be freed 
from the French court order.
