This incredible footage, captured in Tultepec, Mexico, shows the moment brave revellers run away from an uncontrollable giant bull-shaped structure loaded with pyrotechnics.

The video starts with live firecrackers, rockets and Catherine wheels shooting off in all directions and spinning out of control at a festival to celebrate the country's traditional use of fireworks.

Meanwhile the people, who seem to be enjoying the display, dance around cheering the giant bull as it bursts into flames.

Before long the display gets out of hand as thousands of fireworks explode at the same time causing people around it to run away from the chaotic scene.

The courageous crowd then GO BACK to the giant structure alight with sparks to twist it around and release a giant rocket into the sky, much to the delight of the crowd who cheer and applaud the display.

The annual National Pyrotechnic Festival, which takes place in the municipality of Tultepec, began in 1989 as a celebration in honour of John of God, the patron saint of fireworks makers.

The festival includes various events including firework competitions, but the main event remains that of the bulls, with about 250 going along the streets of Tultepec.
