Some will feel the scene is rather seedy. A barefoot young man partying on board a yacht grasps a plastic cocktail glass in one hand and the nozzle of a shisha, or hookah, pipe with the other, holding it to his mouth.

The young man is Prince Harry, who, even at 30, has failed to shed his worrying habit of presenting the world with inappropriate images of the Royal Family at play.

A picture of him sucking on the shisha on a yacht — hired for a lavish party by a Dubai branch of Mayfair nightclub Mahiki — has this week been winging its way round the world.

Prince Harry pictured smoking a hookah pipe on board the Mahiki F1 Boat Party. His antics on board the yacht in Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina last Friday show even at 30 he is presenting the world with inappropriate images of the Royal Family at play. He ended his undignified weekend leaving a club at almost dawn

The colourful scene took place in Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina last Friday, two days before the Formula 1 season’s final Grand Prix was held in the emirate. Harry attended the race on Sunday, and when British driver Lewis Hamilton was crowned World Champion, he was publicly hailed by the Prince — in notably unregal style — as a ‘legend’.

That evening Harry was to be found ‘twerking’ in a nightclub, which he didn’t leave until nearly dawn. All in all, a somewhat undignified weekend.

The problem for the Prince is that everywhere he goes these days, people brandish their smart phones to snap him. At one point, Harry smiled for a photo with his arm round American R&B singer Tyrese Gibson.

Despite the presence of camera phones, one British onlooker aboard ‘HMS Mahiki’ — as the yacht was christened by the London-based nightclub, which Harry’s friend Guy Pelly helped promote — says the Prince was drawing on the hookah pipe ‘in full view of everyone’ for a good 15 minutes.

There is nothing illegal about the shisha, of course, but wasn’t it both foolish and irresponsible for the Prince to use one publicly?

The British Heart Foundation (BHF) has been campaigning vigorously against the mushrooming of shisha bars around Britain because of their grave health risks to users. Though it originated in the Far and Middle East, the pipe’s mix of tobacco and fruit flavours is becoming dangerously popular with youthful users, who say it makes them feel ‘mellow’.

Onlookers aboard the yacht in Yas Marina said Prince Harry, pictured here at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday in the UAE country, was drawing on the hookah pipe ‘in full view of everyone’ for a good 15 minutes

So Harry may receive a sharp reprimand from his grandfather, non-smoking Prince Philip, who has been patron of the BHF since its inception 53 years ago.

As Professor Peter Weissberg, the foundation’s medical director, says: ‘There is a worrying misconception that smoking shisha is not harmful to your health. But strip away the fruity flavours and you’re left with the same toxic and addictive substances as cigarettes, including tar, nicotine, arsenic and lead.’

The BHF points out that in one puff from a shisha, a user inhales the same amount of smoke as from an entire cigarette. Using it for 15 minutes, as Harry did, is equivalent to smoking 25 cigarettes.

That did not deter Harry — a heavy smoker like his great-grandfather George VI, who was just 56 when he died of lung cancer.

Conscious of the efforts by health professionals to persuade the public to stop smoking, Harry does his best to be seen as little as possible in public with a cigarette in his hand. But in the heady atmosphere of HMS Mahiki his caution evaporated, even though last Friday’s event was anything but a private party. Anyone could come aboard if they bought a £150 ticket, and when word got round that the Prince was on board, they certainly did.

For Harry, the Abu Dhabi trip was the wind-down after a three-day official visit to the Gulf state of Oman, where he played in a charity polo match — raising almost £800,000 for his Lesotho children’s charity, Sentebale.

‘By the time he arrived in Abu Dhabi, he wanted to let his hair down and have a bit of fun,’ says a friend of the Prince. ‘But poor Harry has to be so careful these days.’ Not careful enough, it seems, as social media rapidly became awash with reports of the partying Prince, wisecracking intimately with a group of young women.

Of course, there were young women involved the last time Harry’s social life attracted such attention. Two years ago, he went to Las Vegas and played a sleazy game called ‘strip billiards’ with a group of girls he met in the lobby of his hotel and invited up to his room.

Before you could say Your Royal Highness, the picture of Harry wearing nothing but an African necklace and bracelets was all over the internet and published in a certain red-top newspaper.

How pathetic it sounded when one of his advisers complained he’d been the victim of ‘a nasty betrayal by a girl, who pretended she was on her phone, took a picture, and sent it to her boyfriend’.

It seemed that Harry had grown up after his antics two years ago when he went to Las Vegas and played a sleazy game called ‘strip billiards’ with a group of girls he  invited from a hotel lobby up to his five-star room

Since then, it seemed that Harry had grown up. And it must be said that his informal, mischievous style has worked wonders for the Royal Family’s staid image. He is entitled to praise for creating the Invictus Games for injured ex-servicemen, and joining wounded soldiers on a trek to the South Pole.

But he remains accident-prone, as well as naively trusting of strangers. Did he really think no one would photograph him sucking on a shisha in public?

Two days after the Mahiki party, the Prince watched the Grand Prix from the Mercedes team garage, and after Lewis Hamilton crossed the line, Harry came on the team radio to applaud the British driver, telling him: ‘You are an absolute legend. Well done, mate.’

After that, Harry made it known he was ‘ready for a really big night out’. And he was certainly in the right company to find it, in the shape of ex-Wasps rugby player Adam Bidwell, who used to date mezza-soprano Katherine Jenkins.

The 38-year-old rugby player-turned-stockbroker has been a friend of the Prince for five years and accompanied him on his notorious trip to Las Vegas.

Intriguingly, the police protection officer who accompanied Harry to Abu Dhabi was also pictured next to him in a jacuzzi on his Las Vegas jaunt — suggesting that even after the furore over the naked pictures, Harry and royal security bosses are happy with the arrangement.

He was likely to have been with him on Sunday at the Amber Lounge nightclub, the usual after-race watering hole for the F1 racing fraternity, where a table costs a mere £12,000.

Hamilton and his girlfriend, former X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger, were there, but only briefly. They didn’t stay long enough to see Harry merrily ‘twerking’ on the dance floor.

Nor was Harry in any hurry to leave. It was 5am before he slipped out of the club and headed straight for the airport to catch his flight back to London.

‘There were loads of pretty girls throwing themselves at him,’ says a fellow partygoer. ‘Harry was having a great time. The man has stamina — he was partying hard.’ One observer tweeted: ‘Can’t believe I just seen Prince Harry twerking and I didn’t record it. What a guy!!!’

What puzzles many is how Harry, an Army officer, appears to be able to spend quite so much time on social manoeuvres. But after two tours in Afghanistan, his duties are now mainly ceremonial: organising events like the Invictus Games, being involved in the formal side of State visits and in contingency planning for civil disasters.

The Ministry of Defence refuses to say how many hours he spends at his office in London but insists he has ‘a unique role’.

The truth is that since breaking up with Cressida Bonas, Harry has been footloose.

Certainly, the Queen would like to see him settle down and start a family, just as William has. Indeed, an intriguing closeness has been developing between Harry and his grandmother, with whom he has private meetings at the Palace.

‘She will often clear her diary when she knows he wants to drop in and see her,’ says a senior aide. ‘She recognises that he is the most popular member of the Royal Family, and is always interested in hearing what he has to say. And he’s very anxious not to let her down.’

With that in mind, perhaps he ought to think twice next time he finds himself offered a hookah pipe.
