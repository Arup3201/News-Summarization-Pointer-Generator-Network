That’s now changed as the Redmond, Washington-based tech
giant recently rebranded the free version of Office Online
easily available through a website. CBSnews.com
reported.

The software includes 
Word, Outlook, OneNote, PowerPoint, and Excel.

Microsoft has relaunched a free version of its popular Office software that is available through a website

Microsoft previously called its Office free version Office Web
Apps. The big problem with that is it used to be only available through its
cloud storage service known as OneDrive, which used to be called SkyDrive.

One of the reasons Microsoft may have made the change is
that some consumers were complaining they didn’t have a free version of Office
that could compete with rival Google Docs.

And if you find that you’re running out of room on your hard
drive to save all of your Office files, Microsoft allows Office Online viewers
7 gigabytes of storage space through OneDrive. Additional space is available
for a fee.

Microsoft has made other recent changes to Office. It
launched a version of the software for Apple’s iPad. Microsoft also launched a
cheaper version of its subscription-based version of the software known as Office 365 personal for $70.

The cheapest version of Office before then was known as
Office 365 for $100, though that could be loaded onto as many as five
computers.
