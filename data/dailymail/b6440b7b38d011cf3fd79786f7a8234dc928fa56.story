A seven-bedroom castle complete with medieval ruins and even its very own ghost has gone on the rental market for just £1,500 a month.

Bellister Castle, on the outskirts of Haltwhistle, Northumberland, features striking turrets, stone ramparts and views across the Tynedale Valley, and is available through the National Trust for £346 per week.

For seven occupants the price would work out at a mere £214 per month each, but any would-be residents would have to share their spacious home with the 'Grey Man' - the ghost of a minstrel said to have been unjustly accused of being a spy. 

Bellister Castle, which has seven bedrooms, medieval ruins and even its very own ghost has gone on the market for just £1,500 a month

The castle, on the outskirts of Haltwhistle, Northumberland, features 14th century ruins, striking turrets, stone ramparts and views across the Tynedale Valley, and is available through the National Trust for £346 per week

Legend has it that the musician had called at the castle and afforded food and a night's rest, only for the lord of the castle to become suspicious of him.

Picking up on his host's hostile manner, the minstrel left the castle instead of retiring to bed - which for the lord's confirmed his suspicions, and he set his hunting dogs to go after him.

But the dogs tore the musician limb from limb, and to this day he is said to haunt the castle grounds, with some guests reporting hearing the sound of baying hounds and a man screaming. 

The grounds are also home to an old sycamore, known as the hanging tree, where royalist Cavaliers during the civil war are said to have executed defeated parliamentary troops, known as Roundheads.

Inside the spacious seven-bedroom property is more modern than its outward appearance would suggest 

The castle, which boasts this large kitchen, has been owned by the National Trust since 1976, and is available to rent unfurnished on a long-term contract subject to a £2,500 deposit

The property is part of the Bellister Estate, which was owned by Robert de Ros and his descendants from 1191 to 1295, with the castle boasting more modern comforts than the 14th century ruins it is attached to

The property is part of the Bellister Estate, which was owned by Robert de Ros and his descendants from 1191 to 1295, with the castle boasting more modern comforts than the 14th century ruins it is attached to. 

It has been owned by the National Trust since 1976, and is available to rent unfurnished on a long-term contract subject to a £2,500 deposit.

The spacious property is twelve times cheaper than a studio flat in Chelsea, London, close to the King’s Road, which is currently being advertised on Rightmove for £2,708 per month.

The house was occupied by two people up until Autumn last year. 

It also features grand reception rooms with wood-burning stoves and intricate ceiling mouldings, as well as a wide oak staircase, three bathrooms, one pictured here, and an additional attic room

While the ruins are from a medieval castle, the house itself was converted into a mock-Gothic home by architect John Dobson in the 1830s

The castle's master bedroom. Estate agents say the property would be suitable for a family home, or for a business venture as a B&B

'While the ruins are of a medieval castle, the home itself was converted into a mock-Gothic house by the famous architect John Dobson in the 1830s to offer the country gent the chance to live in a stately home in miniature,' said Andrew Poad, general manager for the National Trust in the Hadrian’s Wall area,

'It is a seven-bedroom family home which is a pocket-size castle.

'It could also be a potential business venture as a bed and breakfast, benefiting from excellent access to the east and west via the A69.'

The castle is approached along a tree-lined drive and is surrounded by mature grounds including a walled garden, lawns, stables and an orchard.
