Assurance: David Gauke said George Osborne will introduce marriage tax break

A tax break for married couples will be delivered before the next general election, the Treasury promised yesterday.

David Gauke, the Exchequer Secretary, stressed that George Osborne plans to introduce a  transferable tax allowance for spouses ‘in due course’.

The assurance comes amid a growing rebellion by backbenchers over the tax break, which had been promised by David Cameron.

Tim Loughton, a former Children’s Minister, tabled an amendment to the Chancellor’s Finance Bill, demanding that the tax break be written into law now to show voters that the Tories are serious about supporting the family.

An alliance of rebel MPs  had also tabled a separate Private Members’ Bill to introduce the  tax break.

Many within the party have been troubled by Liberal Democrat opposition and foot-dragging from the Chancellor over the Conservatives’ flagship family policy – but a letter to Tory MPs from Mr Gauke states: ‘The Prime Minister has always been clear that it is important to recognise marriage in the tax system, and this firm commitment remains.’ 

He points out that ‘the Conservative manifesto at the last general election set out our policy to  introduce a transferable tax allowance of £750 between spouses and civil partners’.

He also reminds MPs that ‘our commitment to a transferable tax allowance was restated’ in the Coalition Agreement.

‘The Prime Minister and Chancellor have consistently made clear that we remain committed to recognising marriage in the tax system,’ Mr Gauke wrote.

‘I know that many of you will have heard 
the Chancellor set out his commitment to deliver on this during the 
course of this Parliament.

Making promises: Both Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have pledged that the tax allowance for spouses will be written into law, but it has yet to emerge

Couples benefit: The 'marriage tax break' which also covers civil partners, would see a transferable tax allowance of £750 between spouses

‘An announcement on details of how we will legislate for this in this Parliament will be made by the Chancellor in due course.’

The development suggests that ministers are growing jittery over fury in Tory ranks that the pledge to recognise marriage in the tax system has taken a back seat, while Mr Cameron has pushed through gay marriage against the wishes of grassroots members.

Head rebel: Tory MP Tim Loughton demands the 'marriage tax law' be written before the election

Tory whips have already urged Mr Loughton and his fellow rebels to back down.

The former minister dismissed Mr 
Gauke’s attempt to mollify backbenchers, saying they are ‘tired of 
waiting’ for the policy to become law.

‘The phrase “in due course” is meaningless,’ he added.

‘The letter doesn’t say anything that hasn’t been said before. There are only so many times the Treasury can peddle this line.

‘This was a clear manifesto pledge. There is absolutely no  reason why we shouldn’t get on with it.

‘It is what people expect from this government and there’s absolutely no reason why we have this continual foot-dragging.’

Many Tory MPs blame Mr Osborne for the delay, even though he has repeatedly told Right-wingers in private that he will go ahead with the plans.

Peter Bone, who tabled the Private Members’ Bill, pointed the  finger at the Lib Dems, who are allowed to abstain in any vote on a marriage tax break.

He said: ‘Obviously the Lib Dems have been blocking it. It’s about time we stopped kow-towing to them and do things that Conservatives want.

‘This is something that goes to the heart of conservatism and we shouldn’t worry about what Cleggy and Co say.’
