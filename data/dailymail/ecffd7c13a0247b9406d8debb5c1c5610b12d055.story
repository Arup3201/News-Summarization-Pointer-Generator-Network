One hundred firefighters are battling a huge factory blaze as 'thousands of litres of flammable liquids' inside the building send balls of flames into the sky.

Numerous explosions have taken place at the site, where over 100 workers were evacuated on Friday morning, as a ferocious blaze continues to burn through the buildings in Revesby, in Sydney’s southwest.

Three people have been treated for smoke inhalation at the scene.

NSW Fire & Rescue Superintendent Ian Krimmer told the Sydney Morning Herald the fire began in a car manufacturing factory.

'There are large amounts of chemical liquids and plastics in the factory. There have been several explosions,' he said.  

Police said they were called to the fire at a furniture preparation factory and found it 'well alight'.

Water supply at the scene is said to be dampening the firefighters' efforts to put out the blaze. 

Firefighters were called to the scene in Revesby shortly after 11am responding to multiple calls.

Black smoke can be seen billowing from the hectare-long site and Fire & Rescue NSW has warned this could affect nearby Milperra Road.

Firefighters battled the blaze from behind an iron fence and surrounded by brand new cars  

The factory in Revesby is close to a Toyota parts and services store. Firefighters wore Hazmat suits at the scene 

The thick black fog billowed out above many structures in the industrial area and firefighters are worried the blaze will spread

Nearly 20 fire crews have been called to the blaze while six ambulances are also on site.

Ambulance officers have set up a command post to support firefighters and evacuees.

Thick plumes of black smoke are affecting Marigold Street and Milperra Road, they said.

Aerial shots of the factory show how a fire has ripped through a large section of the buildings. 

Smoke from the fire can be seen all they way from Town Hall in Syndey's CBD. 

'A large exclusion zone is in place with Fitzpatrick, Carrington and Marigold streets all closed. Motorists and members of the public are urged to avoid the area where possible.

'The operation is expected to last a number of hours,' a police spokesperson said.
