Roma, who finished runners-up to Juve last season, are confident they can beat the Turin giants to the title this time around.

'I firmly believe we can win the scudetto,' Roma coach Rudi Garcia told France Football. 'We are still small from a European level but we want to start winning in Italy before we undertake bigger aims.

'I have told (Roma captain Francesco) Totti that I want to win something with him and that he cannot end his career without another league title.'

Roma last won the scudetto in the 2001. The Giallorossi are unbeaten at home in Serie A and take on an AC Milan side that are in seventh place, with just one defeat on the road this season.
