Peter Morris stood transfixed as he watched his sister Claire walk down the aisle, while the groom – resplendent in a kilt and ruff – stood waiting proudly by the front pew.

As they exchanged vows, Peter swallowed hard.

Yet his emotional reaction was borne not of joy, but of grief. For the scene unfolding before his eyes was not the wedding itself, which took place in 1993, but a recreation for ITV drama The Widower.

The Widower featuring Sheridan Smith, an ITV drama, tells the tale of Claire Morris who was murdered on a roadside in Aberdeenshire by her husband Malcolm Webster months after their wedding

The show tells the shocking story of how Claire was murdered by her husband Malcolm Webster on a remote roadside in Aberdeenshire less than eight months later.

Malcolm left the 32-year-old drugged and helpless in his flaming 4x4 vehicle as part of a life-insurance scam.

It would be five years before her family discovered the truth about her death – and another three years before they saw Webster jailed.

In an exclusive interview, Mr Morris revealed his astonishment at the realistic portrayal  of his sister by actress Sheridan Smith.

Mr Morris, who met  Ms Smith while working  as an adviser on the production, said: ‘Sheridan captured Claire completely. I miss that camaraderie of a sibling and I thank Sheridan for giving that back to me for a while.

‘I feel as though if I want to see Claire again all I have to do is switch on this drama. At one stage off-set Sheridan hooked her arm through mine, and I told her it was exactly how Claire did it.’

Also involved as advisers to the producers were Webster’s second wife Felicity Drumm, who later survived a carbon-copy murder attempt, and Simone Banarjee. Webster, played by Reece Shearsmith in the drama, was about to kill her when he was finally arrested.

Webster, now 54, who became known as the Black Widower, was convicted of murder and attempted murder, and was jailed for 30 years at Glasgow High Court in 2011.

Sentencing him, the judge, Lord Bannatyne, said: ‘This was a murder that could properly be described as cold-blooded, brutal and callous.’

Originally from the Surrey commuter town of Guildford, Webster met Claire at the Scottish hospital where they were both nurses.

Within weeks of their wedding, Claire discovered her husband  had debts running into thousands of pounds and she began questioning his spending.

Slowly, his veneer as the caring husband crumbled. He began raiding the hospital drugs cabinet and crumbling strong tranquillisers into her food.

He had taken out life insurance policies and hatched  a plan to murder Claire and cash them in.

Having drugged Claire to the point where she was barely able to walk, Webster put her in the passenger seat of their car, ran it off the road at a secluded spot near their home, doused it in petrol and then set it alight.

After pocketing more than £200,000 in insurance payouts, Webster played the grieving widower  to perfection. Peter recalled: ‘On the day of the funeral I held the cord  to lower the coffin in my left hand and with my right hand I held  Malcolm’s hand. There were tears running down his face. It is beyond my understanding that someone could have faked those tears.’

As the Morris family struggled with their grief, Webster moved to Saudi Arabia where, in January 1997, he met nurse Felicity Drumm. He discovered that she had amassed considerable savings.

Within eight months the pair had moved to Felicity’s native New  Zealand where they married.

After the birth of the couple’s son Edward, they sold Felicity’s house and decided to buy a new home for which, Webster claimed, he could pay half once his money in Scotland had been  transferred. In the meantime he talked Felicity into adding his name to her bank account.

In 1999 he announced the money had been transferred and that he was taking her and Edward on a  picnic to celebrate the news.

Then, just as he had done with Claire, he strapped his wife into the passenger seat of their car and plied her with bottled water infused with tranquillisers, saying she needed to keep her fluids up.

That is the last thing she can remember until the incessant ringing of her mobile roused her. It was her father, who insisted they drive to his house.

Once there, he told her that Webster had drained £300,000 from of her account. When Felicity opened the boot of the car she found it filled with cans of petrol.

She also discovered Webster had insurance policies valued at more than £1  million, all bearing Felicity’s forged signature. Today, having also helped with the ITV drama, Felicity says she is just relieved that she escaped her marriage with her life.

Webster managed to flee New Zealand before a police investigation got under way and headed to the Scottish town of Oban. Although arrest warrants for the murder of his first wife and attempted murder of his second had been issued, it wasn’t long before Webster began hunting for a new wealthy partner.

He met another nurse, Simone Banarjee, in 2005 and they couple got engaged a year later. Webster persuaded Simone – the daughter of a wealthy surgeon – to make him the beneficiary of her will and to add his name to her bank account.

In 2008 Simone was stunned when police came to her door to allege that Webster had murdered Claire and attempted to murder his second wife. Webster was arrested soon afterwards and Simone and Felicity gave evidence at his trial.

For Peter, the drama has healed some wounds. He said: ‘Like everyone else, Webster duped me. He is a callous murderer. I don’t know if he is watching The Widower, but what I do know is that the drama is telling the truth of the terrible death my sister suffered.’

Part two of The Widower will be shown on ITV1 tomorrow at 9pm.
