A veteran police officer escorting President Barack Obama's motorcade in West Palm Beach, Florida has died after being hit by a pickup truck.

Bruce 
St. Laurent, a 20-year veteran of the Jupiter Police Department, was preparing to close off access to a roadway as the President was being transported from a campaign event, when the officer was struck by a Ford F-150.

Palm Beach County Sheriff's spokesman Teri Barbera said the police officer was on Interstate 95 on Sunday afternoon around 5pm when the tragedy occurred.

Mr Obama made a campaign appearance at the 
Palm Beach County Convention Center on Sunday afternoon, part of his 
weekend campaigning in Florida.

'Officer St. Laurent was assigned to the motorcade escorting President Barack Obama from a campaign event in Palm Beach County,' said a statement on a memorial website for St. Laurent. 

'He was struck as he was preparing to close access to the highway from the on-ramp as the presidential motorcade neared. The impact pushed him and the motorcycle into a guardrail.'

Mr St. Laurent, 55, was transported to the nearby St. Mary’s Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

'We didn’t lose a co-worker. We lost a friend,' Sgt. Scott Pascarella told the Palm Beach Post. 'He would do anything for anyone.'

Ms Barbera says an investigation is ongoing and no charges have yet been filed against the driver, who has not been identified.

'I'm so overwhelmed right now,' Jupiter Police Chief Frank Kitzerow said. 'Our first priority is notifying [Mr St. Laurent's] family.'

White House press secretary Jay Carney said the President was notified of the officer's death and added, 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the officer's family.'

'There was a serious accident involving a Jupiter, Florida, police department motorcycle officer, who was part of the motorcycle escort for the motorcade,' Mr Carney told reporters after Air Force One left Palm Beach.

'The accident happened ahead of the motorcade itself and no other vehicle in the motorcade was involved in the accident.'
