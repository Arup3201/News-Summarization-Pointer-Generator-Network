A young woman who says she's addicted to sunbeds admits even getting skin cancer hasn't put her off tanning.

Lucy Simm, 29, from Morecambe, was keen to get back on a sunbed as soon as she had recovered from an operation to remove a cancerous mole on her leg. 

She told Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on today's This Morning: 'It's been very hard to stop, I want to hide away. I feel like a tan gives me a blanket and without it, I have to hide away. I tried fake tan and it's just not the same.'

Addicted: Lucy, left, can't stop using sunbeds despite getting skin cancer. Her sister Sam has also had to have moles removed over fears they were cancerous

Mother-of-one Lucy appeared on the ITV show with her twin sister, Sam, who has also had a skin cancer health scare.

The pair, who are care workers, both started tanning at the age of 14 and it quickly became a daily ritual. They liked the way the tan made them look and feel more confident. 

'It was new to our town, it was a thing to do,' Sam explained.

Mother-of-two Sam stopped going on sunbeds four years ago but some damage was already done.

Dying for a tan: The twins started using sunbeds at the age of 14 and have both had health scares 

She said: 'I noticed a mole on my side which I thought was chocolate because of how quickly it came but it didn't wipe off. I went to the doctors to have it looked at and they referred me and took it off straight away. 

'There was a difficult four to five week wait to see if it was cancer but it was ok.'

Despite Sam's scare, Lucy was not put off going on a sunbed. 

'I put what happened to Sam to the back of my mind. I thought it wouldn't happen to me,' she admits.

But then she also noticed an unusual-looking mole on her leg that was turning a dark blue colour. 

'I showed it to Sam and she knew straight away there was something wrong with it,' she said. 

The mole was removed but further tests revealed Lucy was not as lucky as her sister had been. 

'I was told it was cancer - melanoma - and I would need further treatment. I felt stupid, like I had done it to myself,' she said. 

Be safe: Fake tan is an alternative to using sun beds for those who want a tan without the dangers

A good way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is to use the ABCDE checklist:

A stands for asymmetrical: Melanomas have two very different halves and are an irregular shape.

B stands for border: Unlike a normal mole, melanomas have a notched or ragged border.

C stands for colours: Melanomas will be a mix of two or more colours.

D stands for diameter: Unlike most moles, melanomas are larger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.

E stands for enlargement or evolution: A mole that changes characteristics and size over time is more likely to be a melanoma.

'I couldn't take it all in, I had to leave the room. It's still unbelievable. I had an operation on my leg and I've been left with a big scar.'

But despite the shock diagnosis and treatment, Lucy still can't give up using sunbeds.

She's been back on them following her operation and said she needs help to conquer what she calls an addiction.

'My face wasn't going right without the sunbed,' she said. 'I felt like the skin on my face was drying out and my make up doesn't sit right without a tan.'

Presenters Holly and Phillip encouraged Lucy to try fake tan as an alternative to sun beds and invited her back on the show next week to test them.

The show's resident medical expert, Dr Chris, who has suffered from skin cancer, advised Lucy to follow her sister's example and give up sunbeds for good.

He told her to think of her son and how she was putting him in danger of growing up without his mother.

'I will be happy in my skin one day, it's just getting there,' Lucy said.
