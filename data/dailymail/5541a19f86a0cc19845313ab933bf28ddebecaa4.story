A mother who abandoned her baby in a boiling car on one of the hottest days of the year to go shopping has been cautioned by police.

Concerned passers-by called the emergency services after noticing the child had been left on its own in a supermarket car park on Tuesday when temperatures reached 20C in the shade.

The store in Burgh Heath, Surrey, put out public announcements before police and paramedics arrived shortly after 9am.

The woman is said to have ‘casually’ returned after going into the store to buy baby milk, according to The Sun.

Witnesses said the mother, in her thirties, was carrying several bags of shopping, which she loaded into her black BMW.

A bystander at the scene said: ‘The baby was dripping in sweat.

‘You hear about people stupidly leaving dogs in hot cars, but you wouldn't have thought anyone would be silly enough to leave a baby.

‘Crowds of people were around her car but the mum didn't seem to understand what all the fuss was about.’

Police have confirmed that a woman had been questioned over the incident and was issued with a caution for 'wilful abandonment'.

The baby did not require medical treatment.

Meanwhile an Australian woman was cleared yesterday of her daughter’s manslaughter after she was locked in a car on a 30C day.
