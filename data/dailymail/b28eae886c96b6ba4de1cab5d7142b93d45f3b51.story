He may be be considered one of the most dangerous men in the world...but Kim Jong-Un showed he is in touch with his feminine side as he took a shine to this pair of cream high heels.

The Supreme Leader of North Korea was on a tour of one of the country's shoe factories when he took part in an inspection of the workplace.

The 32-year-old - who assumed control of the secretive state in late 2011 after the death of his father Kim Jong-Il - studied several pairs of shoes during his visit to the Wonsan Shoe Factory, approximately 130 miles from the capital of Pyongyang.

Heel-y good: North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un toured the Wonsan Shoes Factory and was especially interested in the quality of this pair of cream women's high heels

No business like shoe business: Jong-Un studied several pairs of men's and women's shoes as state officials looked on and took notes

Cheery: The Supreme Leader looked delighted to be taken around the factory in these pictures which were released by state-controlled Korean Central News Agency

Sole man: Jong-Un seemed particulary interested in the quality of the soles of the shoes at the Wonsan Shoes Factory, which is approximately 130 miles from the capital city of Pyongyang

State officials were seen shadowing the Supreme Leader and taking notes as he studied the quality of a range of men's and women's shoes in a variety of colours. 

The photos were released by the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency and their origin cannot be verified.

But international observers say the cheery propaganda which emanates from the controversial state keeps hidden a country in which secret arrests and executions are commonplace.

In other pictures that have just been released, Jong-Un was also seen giving field guidance during a drill by the Korean People's Army (KPA) for hitting enemy naval target at an undisclosed location.

Jong-Un closely observed the scene through a pair of binoculars and offered a few pointers during the military drill.

Surrounded by military officials who looked on eagerly with notebooks, Jong-Un also raised a few laughs with his comments, which were not reported by the state agency.

It has been a controversial few months for North Korea, after the claims that the country hacked into Sony Pictures and leaked documents that belonged to the movie company.

The release of sensitive employee information and embarrassing email exchanges by high-level executives was seen to be in retaliation for film The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim.

While North Korea has denied responsibility, it praised the hacking as a 'righteous act'.

Several days later the country's entire internet was brought offline for a day in a suspected retaliatory move by American authorities, although again nobody accepted responsibility.
