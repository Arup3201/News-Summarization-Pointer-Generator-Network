Three Michigan teens face life in prison after being charged in the murder of Michigan State University student Dustyn Frolka, 19, whose body was found partially-clothed on the side of a freeway on February 15.

Prosecutor Chuck Sherman said 18-year-olds Samantha Grigg and Tyrel Bredernitz worked with 16-year-old Brendan Heim to rob Frolka for drug money, but ended up beating him to death with brass knuckles.

Sherman believes the attack happened in the vehicle and that Frolka's body was later dumped at the side of the road.

In addition to studying marketing at MSU, Frolka was a rapper and father to a 10-month-old daughter.

The three teens were arraigned in court on Monday and charged with felony murder, armed robbery and conspiracy to committ armed robbery. Each individual charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Details on what led the group to Frolka are still hazy.

Phone records show that the Frolka began communicating with the group a week or two before his death.

However, Bath Detective Sgt Gary Smith told WLNS there wasn't a 'well known relationship established between them.'

Smith says the driving force of the attack was getting money from Frolka to buy drugs, but authorities wouldn't reveal how much the group was after or if they were successful.

Frolka was found unresponsive at 10:23pm near the East Lansing exit of Interstate 69. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.

As of last week, the cause of death was still unknown though abrasions were found on his body consistent with hitting the pavement.

After figuring out who Frolka was with in his final hours, Bath Township police searched an apartment complex in Saline where they found illegal drugs and arrested one of the suspects.

The two other suspects were arrested after police seized and searched the vehicle believed to be used in the attack.

The investigation is ongoing and prosecutors say more could be arrested in connection to the murder. 

All three suspects have connections to Saline High School. In court on Monday, Grigg said she was a current senior at Saline High while Heim said he was enrolled but hadn't attended since finishing his sophomore year.

According to a 2012 Saline Reporter article, Grigg sang in a local rock band named Undecided. Brendan Heim is listed on the roster for the high school's football team.

Bredernitz said he graduated from the school, while also relaying the fact that he was on probation for another case in 14A district court.

Details on Frolka's life leading up to his death show that he too was dealing with drug issues. 

People who knew Frolka told the Detroit Free Press that he was at one point signed to a Lansing record label but 'had been on a kind of downward spiral' since last fall.

Father: Frolka's older sister says he was devoted to his 10-month-old daughter, and determined to make a good life for her

On January 31, Frolka was arrested by the MSU police for cocaine possession and was subsequently kicked out of his campus dorm - forcing him to move in with friends off campus.

Older sister Pamela Hincka says recent mistakes shouldn't taint her brother's life.

She described him as extremely generous and devoted to his 10-month-old daughter.

'He had goals of making it in the music industry — whether it was the business side of things or the talent side,' Hincka told the Free Press. 'He was working and going to school and trying to make a better life for himself and for (his daughter).'

All three are being held in Clinton County Jail without bond and are set to return for preliminary exams on March 6. Each received a court-appointed attorney.
