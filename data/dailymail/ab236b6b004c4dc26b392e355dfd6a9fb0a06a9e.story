The world's largest clubs keep on splashing the cash as they seek to surpass their rivals and buy the stars to fire them to glory.

Despite rulings such as Financial Fair Play coming into effect, the transfer fees keep on rising.

Sportsmail has collated the top 10, with La Liga dominating the list with six of the most expensive deals on record.

10. DAVID LUIZ (Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain) £50million in 2014 

The Brazilian defender was extremely popular with the Chelsea faithful down at Stamford Bridge and enjoyed a highly successful three years in West London. He helped Chelsea win the FA Cup, The Champions League and the Europa League.

However he was susceptible to the occasional error and such lapses of concentration were never going to sit well with manager Jose Mourinho and Luiz lapped up the chance to move to big spending Paris Saint-Germain.

9. RADAMEL FALCAO (Atletico Madrid to Monaco) £51million in 2013

In the summer of 2013 Falcao was one of the world's hottest properties. Monaco flexed their financial prowess and lured the Colombian international to France.

Falcao fired in 70 goals for Atletico Madrid in just 91 appearances, hence his high fee but after only one injury hit season with Monaco, Falcao has moved to the Premier League on loan

The Colombian forward completed his £6million loan deal to Manchester United in the early hours of Tuesday morning after the Old Trafford club held off competition from Arsenal and Manchester City for his signature.

Moved on: Falcao has already left Monaco after one season and signed for Manchester United on-loan 

8. EDINSON CAVANI (Napoli to Paris Saint-Germain) £55million in 2013

Having impressed during three years in the Serie A for Napoli, scoring 95 goals in 116 appearances, Cavani headed to France to join Paris Saint-Germain who continued to spend big.

Prolific: The Uruguay international has already won three trophies in Paris including the 2014 Ligue 1 title

7. KAKA (AC Milan to Real Madrid) £56million in 2009 

The FIFA 2007 World Player of the Year spent six scintillating seasons at the San Siro for AC Milan prompting a huge bid from Real Madrid in the summer of 2009.

Despite winning the La Liga in 2012 with Los Blancos, a series of injuries and inconsistent form saw the playmaker depart the Bernabeu last year, heading back to Milan. 

However the former Brazil international has already moved on, having signed for MLS side Orlando City for 2015. In the meantime Kaka is on loan back at his first club Sao Paulo.

Hit and miss: Kaka joined Real Madrid with huge expectations but the playmaker never reached that billing

6. ANGEL DI MARIA (Real Madrid to Manchester United) £60million in 2014

United smashed the British transfer record in paying Real Madrid £60million for di Maria as the Red Devils continued their summer rebuilding under new manager Louis van Gaal.

The Argentina international had a fine World Cup but tragically missed out on the final with injury. He was instrumental for Real Madrid for the past four seasons and arrives at Old Trafford with high hopes of inspiring United up the table.

The 26-year-old impressed on his debut against Burnley on Saturday but couldn't inspire United to a win as they were held 0-0 at Turf Moor. Van Gaal will hope he can replicate his stunning Real Madrid form which saw him awarded Man of the Match as Los Blancos won the Champions League in May.

Good start: Di Maria started for United at Burnley on Saturday and was in fine form before being substituted

5. ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC (Inter to Barcelona) £40million and Samuel Eto'o (£20m) in 2009 

Here's a player never short on confidence. Ibrahimovic signed for Barcelona following three successive Serie A titles at Inter Milan.

However after only one season at the Nou Camp, with 16 goals in 29 appearances, he left having fell out with manager Pep Guardiola. 

Ibrahimovic blamed Lionel Messi and Pep Guardiola for his failure at Barcelona, claiming that his former boss used to 'bully' him.

The flamboyant Swedish international has since played for AC MIlan and signed for Paris Saint-Germain in July 2012 where he has guided the club to two successive Ligue 1 titles. 

Short stint: The striker only lasted a year at the Nou Camp having fallen out with manager Pep Guardiola

4. JAMES RODRIGUEZ (Monaco to Real Madrid) £63million in 2014

Rodriguez was one of the revelations of the World Cup this summer, scoring in each of Colombia's games as they reached the quarter-finals of the competition for the very first time, eventually losing 2-1 to hosts Brazil.

In total Rodriguez scored six goals at the World Cup to finish as the leading scorer - one clear of Thomas Muller - while his stunning 25-yard volley against Uruguay was voted goal of the tournament on FIFA.com.

3. LUIS SUAREZ (Liverpool to Barcelona) £75million in 2014 

What can you say about the controversial striker. A series of incidents blighted his superb record at Liverpool.

The Uruguay international fired in 82 goals for the Premier League giants in just 125 games.

Despite the controversy surrounding his bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup this summer and his subsequent ban, Barcelona still came in for striker. Suarez is currently serving his four-month ban for the bite and has yet to make his competitive debut for Barcelona. 

Controversial: Luis Suarez left Liverpool after a series of incidents overshadowed his fine goal scoring record 

 2. CRISTIANO RONALDO (Manchester United to Real Madrid) £80million in 2009

Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo moved to the Bernabeu in a protracted transfer saga. Ronaldo had been sensational at Old Trafford over six seasons, helping Sir Alex Ferguson's side win three Premier Leagues and the 2008 Champions League.

Since arriving at Real Madrid, Ronaldo's impact has been stunning. His goal scoring record is second to none with 178 for Los Blancos in 166 appearances.

Consequently, the Portuguese star has guided Madrid to the 2012 La Liga title and their much desired 'Decima' Champions League in May.

 1. GARETH BALE (Tottenham to Real Madrid) £86million in 2013

The welshman was in inspired form for Tottenham during the last three seasons at White Hart Lane having previously struggled when he arrived at the North London club in 2007.

Bale tranformed his game from a troubled left-back, sitting on the bench at Tottenham, into a match winner. He was scoring crucial goals for fun and Real Madrid finally purchased Bale for a record fee last summer.

The 25-year-old enjoyed a dream first season in Madrid as the forward played a major role in their Champions League and Copa Del Rey successes.
