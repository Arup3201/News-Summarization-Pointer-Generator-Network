Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain insists that his side simply 'have' to qualify for the Champions League after a disappointing 1-1 draw with Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday night.

Bilbao took the lead thanks to an Iker Muniain strike before Higuain levelled the scoring for Napoli in the 68th minute. 

Speaking after the game, Higuain told Sky Sport Italia: 'The truth is I don't feel like talking right now.

'We'll have prepare well for the next match. We have to go there to win and Napoli have to do it.

'We have the team to achieve this.'

Jose Callejon and Higuain missed sitters and the latter also saw a close-range effort brilliantly stopped by Gorka Iraizoz as Napoli pressed in a frenetic ending.

'Considering the way the game went, we can consider our reaction positive and must begin again from that,' said Napoli coach Rafael Benitez.
