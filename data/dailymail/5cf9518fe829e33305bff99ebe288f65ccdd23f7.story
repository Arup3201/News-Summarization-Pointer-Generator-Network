A love story worthy of Downton Abbey has been revealed after a piece of mysterious graffiti was deciphered after more than 100 years.

The phrase 'essere amato amando' was scratched into a window at historic Penrhyn Castle in north Wales, and for years experts believed it was nothing more than a jumble of Latin words.

But it has now emerged that the graffiti was in fact a heartfelt plea by a thwarted lover - thought to have been an aristocratic teenager who was pining after the estate's gardener.

Mystery solved: This graffiti reading 'essere amato amando' had baffled experts for decades

Tryst: The words appear result from a forbidden romance involving Alice Douglas-Pennant

Striking: The story is similar to a story in Downton Abbey which sees Lord Grantham (played by Hugh Bonneville, right) have an affair with a maid

The words have long been dismissed as
 a meaningless scrawl, but an Italian working at the castle said he 
thought he could understand what it was saying.

Resi
 Tomat, the institution's education manager, revealed that the phrase 
was in fact garbled Italian and meant: 'To be loved while loving'.

Historians think the words were etched on the glass by The Hon Alice Douglas-Pennant, known locally as 'Lady Alice'.

She
 is said to have fallen in love with a gardener and been banished to the
 castle tower by her father, wealthy industrialist and Conservative MP 
Lord Penrhyn.

The romantic message in the window pane 
has become a hit with visitors to the castle, which is now owned by the 
National Trust and open to the public.

The story which appears to be behind it 
is reminiscent of a storyline in hit ITV show Downton Abbey, in which 
the Earl of Grantham has an illicit affair with his maid, crossing class
 boundaries.

Patriarch: It was the second Lord Penrhyn who apparently shut up his daughter in her room

House steward Clare Turgoose said that workers at the castle had long puzzled over the graffiti.

But Mr Tomat was able to recognise the language it was written in and translate it into English, she said.

'We knew the room had once been Lady Alice's bedroom, because she had scratched her name on another window pane. So it was fair to assume that the writing was probably hers and we began to dig a little.

'We kept coming across the same story - that as a young woman Lady Alice had fallen for one of the castle staff, possibly a gardener.'

Attraction: The window with the graffiti scratched into it has become popular with tourists

That liaison could explain why the girl was forced to spend so much time cooped up in her room, Ms Turgoose said.

'It was not just on that the daughter of a lord should fraternise with an employee. It was a Downton Abbey situation where the two just don't mingle socially.

'The story goes that he forced her to stay in the nursery to keep her away from her love.'

The message in the window is believed to date to around 1880, and National Trust staff are currently doing research to try and corroborate the romantic tale attributed to it.

Lady Alice was one of 15 children brought up in the neo-Norman castle set in countryside between Snowdonia and Menai Strait.

She never married and died in London in 1939 at the age of 76. Four years ago, an exhibition of her watercolours was put on at Penrhyn, revealing her previously unexpected artistic talents.

The fate of the gardener she was in love with is unknown.
