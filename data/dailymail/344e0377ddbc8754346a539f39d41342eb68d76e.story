Totteham manager Mauricio Pochettino has urged supporters to stop booing Emmanuel Adebayor ahead of Saturday’s clash against Arsenal.

The Togolese striker came close to leaving White Hart Lane on transfer deadline day but saw a loan move to West Ham thwarted by chairman Daniel Levy, while the forward rejected moves to Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace.

Adebayor has been targeted by supporters in recent weeks following comments made by the former Arsenal striker criticising Spurs fans.

But Pochettino insists it is time for supporters to move on and get behind Adebayor – who holds the record for most goals scored in North London Derby’s, with eight goals.

‘Would I like the fans to stop booing Ade? Yes, yes, yes,’ said the Argentine.

‘It’s important that the fans forget the past. And I think he explained why he made the comments.

‘And now, all together, we need to try to get the success. Because we are in a key moment. We need to put out the bad things, the bad energy, we need to try to help each other and try to get the success.

‘He is a long way towards recovering his confidence and his levels - and that is our job: to try to push him and help him and get him in the best condition to improve quickly.’

Meanwhile, Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has responded light-heartedly to claims from former Saints manager Pochettino that he inherited a ‘winning team’ when he took over at St Mary’s in the summer.

Speaking to Catalan radio, Pochettino said: ‘You have to say that they invested close to 80million euros (£59.8million) in the summer and it was already a winning team on the up.

‘When we arrived at Southampton in January of 2013 they had the team that had conceded the most goals in the league. It was a team with a lot of problems, with players like Adam Lallana who wasn’t playing and Luke Shaw who wasn’t playing but in one and a half years we turned it round.’

But Koemansaid: ‘He is free to give his opinions, I’m happy in Southampton and thank you Mauricio; I have an easy job!’
