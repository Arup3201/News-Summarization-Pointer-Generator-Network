Motorists’ satisfaction with England’s potholed roads has plummeted to a record low.

Fewer than one in three drivers say they are happy with the state of the roads - the lowest level since surveys began in 2008 - and the government’s poor record on repairs is to blame for the abysmal ratings, a damning report by MP watchdogs concludes today.

It condemns as ‘ludicrous’ the Department for Transport’s patch-and-mend ‘piecemeal’ funding.

They say this is making it difficult to maintain England’s road network cost-effectively and is leaving millions of drivers frustrated.

Compensation pay-outs for damages caused by poor road conditions cost £31.6million last year alone.

They condemned the decades of ‘unpredictable and fluctuating budgets’ for road maintenance and said ministers should realise that with potholes costing £52 to fill in – rising to £70 in London - ‘prevention is better than cure’.

But they also attack local councils and the Highways Agency for not even knowing where their drains are.

The AA said motorists were paying the price of such ignorance with ‘pools, ponds and puddles that blight UK roads’ because of poor drainage maintenance by highways authorities.

Committee chairman Margaret Hodge blasted the Department for Transport

The powerful House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says the Department for Transport (DfT) had slashed the roads maintenance budget, only to have to make repeated emergency injections of cash to deal with fall-out from floods and other problems.

The report says that since maintenance budgets were cut by £1.2billion over four years from April 2011, the committee said the DfT has had to provide extra funding on nine occasions, totalling £1.1billion.

Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: ‘The department’s piecemeal and stop-go approach to funding for road maintenance in recent decades has made it difficult for highways authorities to maintain roads cost-effectively.

‘There has been too much reactive work in response to flooding and other events and not enough focus on preventative work that is less expensive in the long term.’

She said: ‘Public satisfaction with the condition of our roads is at the lowest level since the surveying of this began in 2008.

‘In the last survey only 30 per cent of the public were satisfied with the condition of the roads and the speed and quality of repairs.’

Mrs Hodge said: ‘The Department’s unpredictable and fluctuating budgets for road maintenance over decades have put value for money at risk.

‘It seems ludicrous that in 2010 the Department cut road maintenance budgets by £1.2billion over the four years from April 2011, but then it has intermittently given £1.1billion additional funding on nine separate occasions for various reasons, including in response to flooding or winter damage to the roads.’

The greatest problems are in London and the South East, according to the Department for Transport.

Mrs Hodge said: ‘The Department must see that prevention is better than cure. It costs £52 to fill in a pothole, or £70 in London, yet it costs over £30million to pay and process compensation claims from road users for damages arising from poor road conditions.’

MPs cited experts at Infrastructure UK who say savings of up to 20 per cent are achievable when there is ‘certainty of funding.’

Mrs Hodge said: ‘Whilst we understand the unpredictable nature of winter weather, too much road maintenance is inefficient because it is reactive and unplanned.

‘Concentrating activity in the winter months is inefficient and costly. Some local highway authorities are far too reactive to events, rather than anticipating, predicting and preventing disrepair.’

She noted: ‘Better information, better planning of funding and a pro-active stance on maintenance are what the Department must promote to have a chance of pleasing unhappy road users.’

The Public Accounts Committee report says the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency are making some progress in improving the way in which road maintenance is carried out ‘but more needs to be done.’

It notes: ‘Public satisfaction with the condition of our roads is at the lowest level since the survey assessing confidence began.’

The Highways Agency, which is an executive agency of the Department, is responsible for maintaining the strategic road network spanning 4,400 miles including almost all of England’s motorways and its most important ‘A’ roads.

The remaining 183,000 miles of local roads are maintained by 152 local highway authorities.

Public spending on maintaining England’s roads in 2012-13 was £4billion.

Astonished that the Agency holds no information on 70per cent of its drainage systems, it said: ‘A good understanding of the state of the roads is absolutely essential for planning cost-effective preventative maintenance’.

AA president Edmund King said its own surveys showed that while its members are relatively satisfied with the state of motorways and trunk roads, one in five say local roads are ‘terrible’.

He said: ‘The Public Accounts Committee reflects this public anger.’ ‘It puts pressure on central government to work more closely with local government to carry out the basics. Effective and regular road maintenance that gives the taxpayer value for money and does the job.’

He added: ‘Central government’s stop-start funding over many years has simply patched up the UK’s roads.’ Lack of ring-fencing of local authority funds for road maintenance has added to this ‘sorry state’.
