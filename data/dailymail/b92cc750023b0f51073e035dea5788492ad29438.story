A woman dumped in a box as a baby outside a stranger's house on a freezing night just hours after being born is hoping to finally trace her birth parents.

Sarah Keating, now aged 34, said she has 'no hard feelings' towards them but just wants to find out what happened and why.

Initially named Elaine after the WPC who dropped the 7lb 1oz baby at a hospital, she is hoping Facebook can finally lead her to her parents.

On the hunt: Sarah Keating, now aged 34, was dumped in a box as a baby outside a stranger's house just hours after being born in 1980 - and now she is determined to track down her birth parents

Extensive appeals were made throughout 1980 in newspapers and on television but the only contact was phone calls to the hospital and her foster mother by a distressed woman in the weeks after her birth.

In a heartbreaking appeal, mother-of-two Sarah said: 'I would love to know who my parents are, not necessarily to have a relationship but I just want to know what happened.

'I would just love to know what my mother looks like. We had a gathering at Christmas with my husband Daniel's family and my two sons have always resembled them.

'I have never looked like anyone.'

The fateful night: Initially named Baby Elaine after the WPC who dropped the 7lb 1oz baby at a hospital, she is hoping Facebook can finally lead her to her parents after she was abandoned on a freezing cold night 34 years ago

Appealing directly to her birth parents, she said: 'I would like to know what happened so please contact me.

'There are no hard feelings. I have had a great life and I could not wish for a better mum and dad but I am just intrigued to find out what happened and why.'

Sarah was left outside Joan Sheldon-Williams' front door in Headington, Oxford, on the night of January 18, 1980.

All the retired librarian heard was a loud bang and the sound of someone running away.

When she saw the box, Miss Sheldon-Williams thought it was old clothes dropped off by a friend, and it was only when she took it indoors she discovered the new-born girl, naked apart from a towel.

Search: Extensive appeals were made throughout 1980 in newspapers and on television but the only contact was phone calls to the hospital by a distressed woman in the weeks after her birth (pictured here back in hospital after being left on a librarian's doorstep)

She immediately called the police and the infant was whisked to the nearby John Radcliffe Hospital, where the only harm seemed to be bruising consistent with what was called 'an unassisted birth'.

Sarah said: 'I think I was born in the hospital grounds. A man was seen at the hospital carrying a box around and I was on a doorstep that was very close to the hospital.

As she is today: Sarah, who lived in an Oxfordshire village until she was aged six years and now lives in Hull and is a married mother of two

'My mum and my dad and I have always thought she (her birth mum) was very young and scared because back then having a baby at that age was frowned upon.

'We just won't know until more information comes to light but that is my theory.'

As part of the new appeal, she posted photographs of herself as a baby and the box she was discovered in and the Facebook page has now been shared around the world, with the pictures viewed tens of thousands of times.

Her adoptive parents told her the story at an early age but it was only as a teenager and then when she became a mother of two sons, now aged nine and five years, that she became increasingly keen to trace her mother.

Sarah, who lived in an Oxfordshire village until she was aged six years and now lives in Hull, has had files from the police that have given her a lot of information, 'but not quite enough', and asked social services if anyone ever came forward but has never made the crucial breakthrough.

It was only after she read about another abandoned baby on Facebook that she thought the social media site could help in her search.

'I never thought I would get anywhere,' said Sarah, who runs her own cleaning company.

'I thought I would try Facebook and I just cannot believe the response.

'People have been putting messages on and I never expected it. It's just overwhelming.'

Sarah was placed in the foster care of Margaret Kyrie in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, as police chased up leads in Oxford, Coventry, Rugby and Nuneaton, where the chocolate mousse box that carried her was originally from.

Evidence: Sarah, who was left in this chocolate mousse box, had files from the police that have given her a lot of information, 'but not quite enough' and now she seeks more

Baby Elaine: At 11 weeks 'Elaine' was given to her adoptive parents and she grew up locally until the family moved to a village in East Riding, Yorkshire when she was aged six years. She now goes by the name of Sarah

There were six telephone calls from a distressed woman claiming to be the mother to the hospital and others later to Mrs Kyrie after a nationwide appeal for help.

At 11 weeks 'Elaine' was given to her adoptive parents and she grew up locally until the family moved to a village in East Riding, Yorkshire when she was six years old.

Rather prophetically, in a fresh appeal for information six months after Sarah was abandoned, Detective Inspector Alan Bowmaker said: 'The file will never close but it may be years and years before we ever hear anything on this again.'

Sarah is hoping that time may have come.

Social media hunt: It was only after she read about another abandoned baby on Facebook that she thought the social media site could help in her search so she set one up
