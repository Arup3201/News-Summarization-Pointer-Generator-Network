Tough: Companies put up prices for the majority to help pay for green solutions for the poorest and oldest in society, but now face fines for not spending the cash

Energy giants that are failing to help thousands of poor families and pensioners cut their bills face huge fines.

Millions of households saw bills increase on the promise that companies would use the extra money to pay for home insulation, double glazing and new boilers.

However, a number, including British Gas and SSE, took the money but failed to carry out all the work that was expected.

The idea was to cut the UK’s carbon emissions by helping the poor to reduce their energy use. Under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target and Community Energy Saving Programme, each major energy supplier and generator was given targets in terms of the number of homes that would be improved.

All the work was due to be completed by last December. As a result of the missed deadline hundreds of thousands of homes have not had the help expected to cut energy use.

Industry regulator Ofgem yesterday said the firms involved face enforcement action – likely to include multi-million-pound fines.

Executive director of the consumer 
champion Which?, Richard Lloyd, welcomed the crackdown, saying: ‘It's 
right that Ofgem is taking action against those energy companies who 
have not met their energy efficiency targets.

‘Consumers pay for these schemes through their energy bills, and so have a right to know how much they are costing.’

Requirements to make millions of homes more energy efficient were established under two schemes, CERT – Carbon Emissions Reduction Target – and CESP – Community Energy Saving Programme.

The idea was that these would cut the UK’s carbon emissions by helping the poor to reduce their energy use and bills.

Each major energy supplier and generator was given specific targets in terms of the number of homes that would be improved and the resulting cut in carbon emissions.

The CERT scheme involved insulating homes, switching the energy supply from oil to gas or paying for free energy displays to encourage people to cut down on use of heat and light.

The work would save 293million tonnes of carbon emissions, which was the equivalent to insulating 11.5m homes.

Improvements: The money raised from higher prices was meant to be used to pay for new boilers, insulation and other greener energy products

The CESP scheme encouraged the firms to form partnerships with local councils and housing associations to support major schemes that would transform entire estates.

This involved replacing old inefficient boilers, providing solid wall insulation or green energy through, for example, solar panels.

All the work was due to be completed by December last year, however, British Gas, the country’s biggest household supplier failed to meet the targets.

In terms of CESP, it only reached 62.4per cent of its obligations, while the figure was 98.9per cent for the CERT scheme.

Earlier this year, the company revealed an 11per cent rise in profits to £606million for 2012. This helped its parent company, Centrica, to post a 14per cent rise in profits to £2.7billion.

Scottish Power only met 70per cent of its CESP target. SSE managed a score of 90.9per cent on CESP and 98.5per cent on CERT.

A number of electricity generating firms also failed badly to hit CESP targets, including the giant Drax power station, in north Yorkshire, at just 37.1per cent, and GDF Suez/IPM, which has seven power plants, at 38.6per cent.

The worst performing firm was Intergen, which runs three power stations in England, which met just 6.5per cent of the target it was given to help families improve their home energy efficiency.

The net result of the collective failure is that hundreds of thousands of homes have not had the help expected to cut energy use and so lower bills.

Energy & Climate Change Secretary, Ed Davey, said millions of people have been helped by the schemes, which have now been replaced by what he said was a new tougher regime.

However, he said: ‘I am disappointed that under the old schemes, some companies failed to meet their obligations.

‘Ofgem will be conducting a thorough investigation and will take any necessary enforcement action. We are already acting through the Energy Bill to give Ofgem the teeth it needs in future to get compensation to those directly affected.’

Ofgem’s enforcement chief, Sarah Harrison, said: ‘At a time of rising energy bills energy efficiency can make a big difference for consumers.

‘Ofgem’s role is to ensure that consumers do not lose out by the failure of firms to deliver all the help required or are not disadvantaged by late delivery.’

British Gas B said it has spent £1.1billion on home insulation and energy efficiency measures under the CERT and CESP schemes. This paid for the insulation of three million homes and 65,000 new boilers.

It blamed the bad weather over the winter for not being able to carry out as many home improvements as it would have liked.

Scottish Power said that while it did not meet the December 2012 deadline, it has contracts in place to ensure the promised insulation and other measures are carried out. SSE said it did complete all the work that was expected, but was unable to provide the necessary verification in time.
