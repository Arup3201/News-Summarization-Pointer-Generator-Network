Greg Dyke took a public stand against Sepp Blatter on Tuesday, joining the chorus of calls for the FIFA president to resign and describing his accusation that the British media is racist as ‘offensive’.

Dyke was one of only two leading football officials who challenged Blatter after the 78-year-old Swiss had delivered a speech to UEFA Congress here in Sao Paulo.

Blatter sparked fresh controversy on Monday when he claimed allegations of corruption around the Qatar victory to host the 2022 World Cup was being driven by the ‘racism and discrimination’ of the ‘British media’.

Football Association chairman Dyke 
said he found the remarks ‘completely unacceptable’ and stood up to the 
FIFA president in an auditorium at the city’s Renaissance Hotel.

 ‘The
 only reason I did it was because of what Mr Blatter said yesterday, 
which I found, as I’m sure many of you found, offensive,’ he said.

Dyke
 shared his response to Blatter with the media. ‘I said: “Could I say 
that I regard the comments you made yesterday about the allegations in 
the British media in which you described them as racist as totally 
unacceptable. I have read the articles in the Sunday Times in great 
detail, and the allegations being made have nothing to do with racism. 
They are allegations about corruption within FIFA.

‘These
 allegations need to be properly investigated and properly answered. We 
need to know from Mr Garcia (Michael Garcia, the independent FIFA 
investigator) tomorrow if he was aware of the material in the Sunday 
Times before it was published and, if not, whether he will now extend 
his investigation to consider these allegations.

‘Mr
 Blatter, many of us are deeply troubled by your reaction to these 
allegations. It’s time for FIFA to stop attacking the messenger and 
instead consider and understand the message.’

Dyke
 said Blatter did not react as he stood at a lectern on the stage. ‘He 
said it would be addressed tomorrow in FIFA Congress,’ said Dyke. 

David
 Gill, the former Manchester United chief executive and current member 
of the UEFA executive committee, echoed Dyke in a press conference after
 the European governing body’s meeting had finished. 

When Dyke was asked if Blatter should now stand for re-election next year, he replied: ‘Dave Gill has real concerns.

Fury: Both FA chairman Greg Dyke and England's UEFA vice-president David Gill are unhappy with Blatter

‘Obviously there would have to be a decision made by the FA board but I think that we all accept that four years ago he (Blatter) said he was only standing for one more term. 

‘We were asked at a meeting fairly recently and our view was that among the British public there wasn’t any doubt that brand FIFA is severely damaged. And I suspect that’s the same throughout large parts of Europe.

‘I suspect there is a view within the FA that we would support that position (that Blatter should stand down) but we will decide that at the board, which is the proper place.’

Pressed for his personal view, Dyke then said: ‘It’s certainly Dave Gill’s view and we all accept that four years ago he said he would stay on for one more term and he should probably stick to that

‘In these circumstances, when a third of the FIFA ExCo has already resigned due to corruption allegations, I think what you want … there have been serious allegations that need to be investigated.

Should he stay or should he go? Blatter has indicated he plans to run for another term as FIFA president

‘If they turn out to be true then it’s difficult for a chief executive figure to continue in most circumstances.’

It was a courageous stance for Dyke to take, particularly when Europe’s opposition could prove futile given the widespread global support Blatter has appeared to retain this week. There was no standing ovation at the end of UEFA Congress – indeed he needed the protection Sao Paulo’s Shock Battalion riot police to enter the UEFA hotel - but from continents like Africa and Asia that has been the reaction, and at the end of the day Europe have just 53 of the 209 votes for the president.  

Gill, also the vice-chairman of the FA, nevertheless backed Dyke. ‘That statement made by Mr Blatter was, from our perspective, totally unacceptable and factually incorrect,’ he said.

‘To attempt to portray it as a racial or discriminatory attack is totally unacceptable.

‘What is important is we test that information. We should be saying we’re not happy about it, what are we going to do about it and let’s investigate it fully. 

‘We can’t have football being the number one game in the world , growing year by year, without having that responsibility around it.’

Time to go? Gill has urged FIFA president Blatter, 78, not to stand for a fifth term

Asked for his view on 78-year-old 
Blatter’s decision to stand for a fifth term, Gill said: ‘I’m surprised.
 I think the very fact that in 2011 he was clear that it was for four 
years, I  think that should have been the situation.

‘To see he has changed his mind is disappointing.’

Asked
 whether Blatter should go, Gill then replied: ‘Personally, yes. I think
 we need to move on. But that's just my personal opinion. There are 209 
countries voting for the new president. 

‘But
 if I was the chief executive and I had these allegations and these 
concerns, I wouldn't look at them negatively and blame people for 
bringing them forward. 

‘I 
think FIFA would benefit significantly from a change. If you look at 
what happened at the IOC, the IOC is now a much more respected 
organisation.’

Before Dyke stood up to challenge Blatter, Dutch federation president Michael van Praag tore into the under-fire FIFA president.

Van
 Praag might yet emerge as UEFA’s choice to stand against Blatter next 
year and the fact that he is a FIFA ExCo member was certainly 
significant.

In the 
behind-closed-doors UEFA Congress it is understood he told Blatter: ‘In 
the last eight or nine years, FIFA has built an ugly reputation, not 
only in the press but you only have to look at Twitter - #FIFA #Blatter 
#FIFA Mafia. 

‘There are 
reasons – bribery, money and corruption are so often linked. FIFA has a 
bad reputation. FIFA has an executive person and if you like it or not, 
you have a responsibility.’

To
 the media Van Praag then said: ‘I took the floor and I said that if you
 look at the reputation FIFA has built over the last 7 to 8 years, with 
accusations of corruption, bribery and all kinds of old-boy network 
things, FIFA has an executive president and that means you are 
responsible.

‘You don't make
 it very easy on yourself because what you said on Qatar was the wrong 
choice, which means you blame your executive committee.

‘All these problems occurred when you were president so I believe that you should not run anymore.’

Responding to Blatter’s accusations of racism, Van Praag said: ‘I was not happy because this has nothing to do with racism.’
