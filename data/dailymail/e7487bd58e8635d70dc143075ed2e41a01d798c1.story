McDonald’s children’s menu just got a little smarter.

The fast food giant is giving away at least 15 million in books in its U.K. Happy Meals over the next two years, in place of toys.

McDonald’s says it will have distributed the millions of fiction and non-fiction books to British families by the end of 2014.

The literary offering for kids began Wednesday with a five-week promotion in which a non-fiction book from Dorling Kindersley's ‘Amazing World’ series will be given away with each Happy Meal, the Guardian reported.

The promotional effort is sponsored in part by the U.K.’s National Literacy Trust as the independent charity group looks to further encourage literacy in the country.

The ‘Amazing World’ books cover topics including stars and planets, animals and oceans.

‘When children own their own books, it makes a huge difference to their reading,’ Conal Presho, the NLT’s head of fundraising, told the Guardian.

‘Our focus is on using any way we can to encourage children to read, and to read anything they can, whether that's menus in restaurants, non-fiction books or magazines – anything which spreads children's enjoyment of reading.’

McDonald's also plans to launch new ‘Happy Readers’ £1 book offers, which will be redeemable at British book retailer WHSmith.

The fast food chain said it will additionally ‘lend its family-friendly restaurant environment and its focus on family fun to encouraging parents and children to enjoy books together.’

In addition to Kindersley, McDonald’s plans to work with other authors and publishers over the next two years, the company says.

The latest book offerings follow a similar effort last year when McDonald’s gave away nine million Michael Morpurgo books in its Happy Meals.

Alistair Macrow, McDonald's vice president and head of marketing in the U.K., said the feedback from its previous book giveaway pilot had been 'overwhelmingly positive.'

He said that 9 out of 10 parents wanted to see more book promotions from the popular burger chain.

McDonald’s has 1,200 restaurant locations in the U.K. and an estimated 12,800 locations in the U.S.

McDonald’s is the world's largest chain of fast food hamburger restaurants, serving around 68 million customers a day in 119 countries.
