A Washington, D.C., police officer involved in a paternity dispute with his mistress shot the woman dead and left their infant child to die in a hot car, prosecutors say.

Richmond Phillips killed the two because he didn't want to pay child support, prosecuting attorney Angela Alsobrooks said during opening statements in a Maryland court on Monday.

Phillips is being tried on two counts of first-degree murder along with child abuse and firearms charges.

Richmond Phillips killed 20-year-old Wynetta Wright and their 1-year-old child, Jaylin, because he didn't want to pay child support, prosecuting attorney Angela Alsobrooks said

The officer was arrested in June 2011 after the body of 20-year-old Wynetta Wright was found in a park where the two had met.

Their child, Jaylin, who was days shy of her first birthday, was found dead in her car seat with the doors closed and the windows rolled up.

Funeral services were held in June for the two victims. The mother and daughter were described as lying together in one casket after their tragic deaths.

‘It's indescribable, it hurts my heart to know that she went through that,’ Andrea Smith, the victim’s cousin, told ABC7 News at the time.

Friends and family have described the late 20-year-old mother as sweet, outgoing and determined.She was a member of the Prince George’s County Sheriff’s Explorer program and one day had a dream of becoming a sheriff’s deputy.

Police say they believe Phillips lured Wright to the woods behind a Hillcrest Heights community center Monday night and killed her.

He then left the baby to die strapped in her car seat in 100-degree heat, police say.Wynetta was found lying in Oxon Run Stream Valley Park, Maryland, and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Shortly thereafter, Jaylin was found abandoned and dead in the nearby vehicle.

Phillip’s defense lawyer, Brian Denton, told jurors his client is innocent and that the evidence is circumstantial.

The suspect’s mother, Ruth Phillips told ABC 7 in June 2011 that she doesn’t believe her son commited the two murders.

‘I didn’t raise him like that,’ she said.
