Despite Oklahom'a same-sex marriage ban, this gay couple have wed on an Indian reservation in the conservative state.

Darren Black Bear, 45, and Jason Pickel, 36, tied the knot at the Fort Reno chapel in El Reno after they were granted a marriage licence from the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, one of only a few Native American tribes to allow such unions.

The newlyweds are the third same-sex couple to be granted to a marriage licence from the tribe since 2012.

Mr Black Bear, who is a member of the Oklahoma-based tribe, said: ‘It's really kind of surreal.

‘I thought that was not something that would happen in my lifetime.’

His father, Reverend Floyd Black Bear, officiated the service in front of about 50 friends and family of the couple, who have been together for nine years.

Progressive tribe: The same-sex couple were the third to be married in Oklahoma because the tribe issued them with marriage licences

The longtime civil activist who marched with Martin Luther King Jr in Alabama in 1965, said: ‘We've got a lot of tribal members that are gay along with other tribes in Oklahoma.

‘That's a reality and we can't sit back and allow these people to be deprived of their rights.’

The constitution for the 12,500-strong tribe restricts the tribal government from creating or enforcing any law which discriminates against a person based on sexual orientation. The constitution was redrafted in 2006 by the majority of tribal members.

Who are we to judge: Rev Black Bear said that many of the tribe members were gay and that the group could not deprive people of their rights based on their sexual orientation

The tribe lieutenant governor Amber Bighorse, 37, said the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes had a long history of progressive leaders and acceptance of homosexuality among its ranks.

She said: ‘It's not just that we have that provision in our constitution. 

‘That provision got in there for a reason. Culturally, from my experience and what I've witnessed in all of my years, the Cheyenne and Arapho is a community that has always been open and accepting of gay tribal members.’

In Oklahoma, same-sex sexual activity was permitted in 2003 when state sodomy laws were struck off but the state continues to forbid same-sex marriage.
