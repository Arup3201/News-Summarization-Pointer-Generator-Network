The veil of friendship has been wrenched from the Formula One World Championship. It happened here in sunlit Monaco, when Lewis Hamilton appeared to threaten to drive his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg off the track as revenge for the controversial manner in which the German took pole position.

The drama started as Rosberg, who already held the fastest time, pushed hard in his final qualifying lap. Braking from 160mph into the right-hander Mirabeau, he lost control. Rather than taking the corner, he steered his car unscathed into a small run-off area on the left.

Behind him, Hamilton was eating up the tarmac. He was on target to snatch pole position from Rosberg. But as he arrived at Mirabeau, Rosberg was reversing on to the track. Yellow caution flags were waved and Hamilton had to abort his attempt.

Denied: Hamilton was unable to complete his final lap meaning Nico Rosberg got pole position

The question was whether Rosberg had deliberately gone off to ensure pole. Had he done what Michael Schumacher did at the Rascasse corner in 2006, when he blocked Fernando Alonso’s last lap. For that act of cheating, Schumacher was sent to the back of the grid, his reputation tarnished.

Hamilton’s body language suggested he thought his team-mate had erred, even though the stewards ultimately ruled that he had not. His face told of sullen indignation as he posed unwillingly for the post-qualifying pictures of the top three. For the record, Daniel Ricciardo was third.

Potentially the most incendiary comment Hamilton made was when asked if he would discuss the matter with Rosberg. He said, cryptically: ‘I don’t know if (Ayrton) Senna and (Alain) Prost talked about it, but I quite liked the way Senna dealt with that, so I’ll take a page out of his book.’

He could 
have been referring to several incidents, or the whole poisonous 
atmosphere among the two great rivals of the 1980s and 1990s, but most 
observers thought he was referring to Senna turning his car into Prost 
at the start of the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix.

A night’s sleep will probably have encouraged him to abandon such notions before he lines up on the grid.

Mercedes’s PR functionaries will probably brief that he did not mean any harm to Rosberg at all.

Whatever
 they say, the dynamics of this title fight have changed irrevocably. 
The matiness has not lasted to the start of the sixth race of the 
19-round season, and we observers can say hurrah for that. The 
disintegration began in earnest earlier this week when Hamilton claimed 
he was hungrier than Rosberg because his childhood was poor rather than 
gilded like his Monaco-based team-mate.

Body language: Hamilton didn't hide his anger with his team-mate very well

Controversial: Rosberg was forced to take to the escape road on his final run in Saturday's qualifying session

Hamilton was almost monosyllabic in the immediate aftermath of the controversy. Asked what he thought about hearing over the radio that the yellow flags had been waved, he said: ‘Not much really.’

Asked to elaborate, he replied: ‘Not really much. I didn’t really think of anything. The lap was done and that was that.’

Asked if he thought Rosberg had stopped on purpose, he said: ‘Potentially.’

At this point, the paddock returned a split verdict. Damon Hill, the 1996 world champion, exonerated Rosberg. Johnny Herbert, a former team-mate of Schumacher, raised a few doubts. Sir Jackie Stewart, the triple world champion, said he hoped Rosberg had not strayed from sportsmanship.

As everyone chipped in his thoughts, Rosberg’s father Keke, world champion in 1982, stood outside the Mercedes motorhome. He, we recall, had criticised Schumacher as ‘a cheap cheat’ for the Rascasse disgrace.

Three-and-a-quarter hours after qualifying ended, the stewards cleared ‘the driver of car six’ after ‘examining video and telemetry data from the team and FIA’.

What next? Prost, who could be described as an expert witness on this subject, said only a few days ago: ‘One little problem inside the team, or a little bit outside, and then the feuding could start really very quickly.’

The best hope of Hamilton passing Rosberg is presented at the first corner – if he resists any urge to drive him off. Otherwise, the restrictively thin track will work in Rosberg’s advantage.

The scene is set: The sun shines over the race circuit in Monaco

That is but one reason why yesterday was balm to the German. He had been outperformed in most critical moments of the opening races of the season and desperately needed to arrest the slump. In doing so, in these dramatic circumstances, he has also possibly damaged Hamilton’s sometimes brittle psyche. How he will recover today will be intriguing and instructive.

Stewart said: ‘I spent my whole life as a professional racing driver trying to take emotion out of it. You cannot afford to be happy or angry. The moment you do, you lose control. You have to be clear headed, cold and focused. I am surprised Lewis reacted the way he did.’

But how will Hamilton react at the first corner today? Eyes on every yacht will be watching.
