An Italian artist has plowed a giant 492ft portrait of President John F Kennedy in a field to mark the 50th anniversary of his assassination.

Land artist Dario Gambarin created the artwork of the late president in a field near to Verona, Italy.

It took Gambarin six hours using a tractor and trailer. He even wrote the words 'Ich bin ein Berliner' next to the face in memory of Kennedy's iconic speech on June 26, 1963 in West Berlin.

Gambarin has reproduced several different famous faces by plowing including Pope Francis, President Barack Obama and Edvard Munch's The Scream, reports NBC.

November 22 will mark the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. The 35th US president was assassinated in Dallas Texas in 1963.

He served as president from 1961 until he was killed while in the presidential limousine with his wife, Jacqueline.

Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the murder but he was killed before he could stand trial.

Hard work: Gambarin used a tractor and trailer to create the artwork

Many items that make up the searing images from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy — from the ill-fated presidential limousine, to the grave site eternal flame, to the historic Air Force One plane where Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office — are now available for public viewing, 50 years after his death

A commemoration event will be held at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, where Pulitzer Prize-winning author David McCullough will read excerpts from Kennedy's speeches.

Fifty years after the President's sudden and unexpected death, public skepticism and conspiracy theories still linger around who killed Kennedy.
