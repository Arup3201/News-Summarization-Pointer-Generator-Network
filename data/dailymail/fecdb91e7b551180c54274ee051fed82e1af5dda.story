After last September’s derby defeat, Manchester United manager David Moyes resorted to boxing metaphors.

‘I can take the punches and I am sure there will be more,’ said Moyes in the wake of a 4-1 loss  at the Etihad Stadium that gave the first indication of how difficult his debut season at United was going to be.

What nobody expected back then was just how punch-drunk Moyes and United would look at times over the ensuing weeks and months.

If he hasn’t quite been on the canvas this season then he has certainly leant heavily on the ropes. On Tuesday night at Old Trafford one senses he must drag a match-winning performance from his team if United and their supporters are to take anything from a wretched season.

‘The punches have definitely hurt,’ said Moyes on Monday when invited to return to the theme.

‘They’ve hurt more because I joined Manchester United with big expectations, that I’m coming to the winning football club.

‘I’ve got a winning mentality and that’s what I wanted to do.

'So I’m disappointed with myself and I’m disappointed that we’ve been unable to win more. It’s not for the want of trying, that’s for sure.’

Given that Manchester City are deep into a Barclays Premier League title race, Tuesday night’s meeting is more important to them than it is to a team whose domestic aspirations now amount to little more than a salvation of pride.

Such is United’s profile, though, such has been the unending drama of their season, the focus once again seems centred on the defending champions.

Victories over Olympiacos and West Ham — the second more impressive than the first — have leant United a slightly more settled air, given the trauma of the preceding home defeat by Liverpool.

The trouble with the current United, however, is that they only ever look one defeat away from fresh disaster and it’s hard to escape the feeling that if City arrive with the throttle open they may just burn the house down.

Victors on enemy territory in each of the last two seasons, Manuel Pellegrini’s team also have memories of September’s mauling to buoy them.

Asked if he was surprised how poor 
United were, City midfielder Fernandinho said: ‘Yes, of course I was. It
 was the first time I’d played them after joining City.

‘It’s
 a club with a lot of history, with very good players, they were the 
champions — so yes, I was surprised at how badly they played that day 
and how easily we won.

‘The situation is different now because we are fighting for the title and they are not, they are maybe just fighting for honour now. It’s been a bad time for them but I saw their game against Olympiacos and they played very well.’

Pellegrini neatly sidestepped a question about how many United players would get into his team.

Nevertheless, it was a moot point. 
There does seem to be a widening gap between the teams and United’s 
cause is not helped by a defensive crisis that will only be partially 
eased by the return of Rio Ferdinand and by a clear imbalance between 
the two midfields. 

More than 20 goals have sprung from the 
centre of City’s midfield this season, for example, while United can 
boast only one each for Michael Carrick and Tom Cleverley.

Pellegrini would only say that ‘maybe United are more stronger and we are more technical’ in that area, while Moyes did his best to counter suggestions that his team had essentially been blown away in midfield by teams like Liverpool, City and Chelsea this season.

Whatever the case, United will have to find a way to stop the marauding Yaya Toure before they can even think about imposing themselves. 

Asked on Monday if he had questioned himself this season, Moyes was candid.

‘I don’t actually blame myself,’ he said. ‘It wouldn’t be right to say there are things you wouldn’t maybe look at in a different way. But I’ve looked back at many things and most of the things we’ve carried out we would continue to do.’

Moyes’s self-belief will either encourage or baffle United fans, depending on their point of view. Certainly Tuesday night he needs to give them something to cling to.

To return to the boxing theme, United’s domestic title belt is already surrendered. To land one final punch on Tuesday, though, would at least indicate some champion spirit remains.
