Divorcée Linda Walker Zevallos starting dating the real estate heir for six months 15-years-ago

A woman who dated millionaire murder suspect Robert Durst 15-years-ago revealed she ended their relationship after she 'sensed something was wrong.'

Divorcee Linda Walker Zevallos starting dating the real estate heir, who she described as a 'good listener,' after meeting him on flight between New York City and Dallas.

Durst made no mention of the unsolved disappearance of his wife and instead told the mother-of-one he was a labor lawyer with two daughters who both attended Harvard University, she told NBC News.

During their six month relationship in 2000 Ms Zevallos visited his Dallas apartment that had bizarre concrete flooring.

She also introduced Durst to her 13-year-old son.  

'(Durst) was nice when I was with him, pretty much,' she told the news channel.

'But if he didn't get his way, then he was a little mean. But then he'd turn around and apologize later.' 

She told how he had kept guns in the back of his car and had even once kicked her under the table when she ordered the same entree as him. 

Ms Zevallos said Durst also confided in her that he would have to make a trip to visit Susan Berman who having 'problems.'

Durst, who is worth an estimated $100 million, was arrested in New Orleans last weekend

She ended their relationship due to his 'eccentricities' before Berman was gunned down at her home in Beverley Hills on Christmas Eve 2000, she told NBC News.

But when she heard of the Berman murder she said: ' A light bulb went off - oh my.'

Durst, 71, was sensationally acquitted of the 2001 murder of neighbor Morris Black and has long been suspected of killing his first wife, Kathie, and then murdering long-time friend Susan Berman.

He was shockingly caught on tape saying 'I killed them all,' at the end of the HBO documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst.

Durst, who is worth an estimated $100 million, was arrested in New Orleans earlier this month, shortly before the finale of the series aired.

Police believe he was preparing to flee the country as he was found in a hotel room with a latex mask, false ID, a loaded Smith & Wesson .38 caliber revolver with one spent shell casing and $42,000 in cash.

A small amount of marijuana was also discovered.

He is now on suicide watch as he awaits trial in Louisiana on gun and drug possession charges and extradition to California to face a murder trial in the Berman case.  

Susan Berman's death has been linked to Durst

But as new interest has been aroused in Durst, he finds himself linked to cases in at least four states 

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline yoga teacher Allison Modafferi urged Durst to be honest with police if he knows anything about what happened to her sister, honors student Kristen Modafferi.

'If he — or anyone — knows anything, please come forward so we can have some answers,' pleaded Allison, who is expecting a daughter in June.

'It's been nearly 18 years so as a family we would welcome anything that could put our minds at rest,' she added. 

'We hope that one of these days we will get some answers as to what happened to Kristen.'

Kristen disappeared from San Francisco in 1997. Oakland Police now say there is no hard evidence to suggest that Durst was involved, even though he was living in the city at the time. 

Eureka Police Department in California has said they want to probe links between Durst and 16-year-old Karen Marie Mitchell, who vanished after leaving her aunt's store in 1997. Durst had reportedly visited the aunt's store dressed in drag.

In 2003, Durst was acquitted of murder after he admitted to killing a neighbor in self-defense, dismembering him and throwing the body parts in Galveston Bay, Texas.

He admitted that he had shot neighbor, Morris Black, in the defense but that his actions were self-defense. At the time, Durst was living as an odd and mute woman, named Dorothy Ciner.

He also has been suspected - but never charged - in the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen McCormack, in New York.
