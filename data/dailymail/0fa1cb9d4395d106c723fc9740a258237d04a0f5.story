It is less than two months since she gave birth.

But Chelsea Clinton's mommy tummy already appears to have vanished.

Gracing the red carpet for the first time since welcoming baby daughter Charlotte, the 34-year-old was looking trim in a black, patterned Oscar de la Renta dress and heels to collect one of Glamour Magazine's Woman Of The Year awards.

She emerged beaming, hand-in-hand with banker husband Marc Mezvinsky, to pick up her accolade for work on the Clinton Foundation at New York's Carnegie Hall, leaving little Charlotte at home.

And according to Arianna Huffington, who attended the event, Chelsea revealed to her that she is 'still nursing and loving it!' 

The pair, who remained active and in the public eye until two days before the birth, have kept a relatively low profile in recent weeks, aside from attending Oscar De La Renta's high-profile funeral in New York last week.

The day of her daughter's birth, she tweeted happily: 'Marc and and I are full of love, awe and gratitude as we celebrate the birth of our daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky.'

One day later, she posted a photo of herself and her husband, an investment banker, beaming over their newborn daughter.

'We need to close the imagination gap for women. I want Charlotte and girls everywhere to achieve dreams'

She wrote: 'At 7:03 PM on September 26th, we finally met Charlotte. We're in love.'

Charlotte is the first grandchild for Bill and Hillary Clinton, who tweeted after the birth that they were 'over the moon' to welcome the newest family member. 

The couple, who married in July 2010, announced in April that they were expecting their first child.

When Chelsea announced her pregnancy during a Clinton Foundation event devoted to empowering young women, she told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.

'I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders,' she added.

'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.' 

And tonight, her excitement was palpable. 

She grinned at photographers, posing with fellow award-winner Lupita Nyong'o, who won an Oscar for her role in 12 Years A Slave earlier this year.
