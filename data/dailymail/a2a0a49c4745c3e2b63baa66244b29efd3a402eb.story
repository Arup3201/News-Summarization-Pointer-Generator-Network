Britain is well known for being a nation of animal lovers and now a new concept from the east is set to enable the cat-lovers amongst us to take their obsession to a new level.

The first ever ‘cat café’ is set to open in London later this year if enough funding can be raised on the crowd funding site indiegogo.com.

A cat café is essentially a normal café; serving sandwiches, cakes teas and coffees, the only difference being it is filled with cats, which roam the café freely for you to pet and play with.

Feline fine: Lauren Pears explains that 'cat welfare is really important to us and we want to choose cats that will be happy in the environment that has lots of people in it'

Paws for thought: Customers at cat cafes can interact with the cats, petting and stroking them, as they eat and drink

Already hugely popular in Taiwan, China and Japan, there are about 100 cat cafés in Tokyo already.

The brains behind bringing this feline phenomenon to the UK is Lauren Pears.

Lauren points out: ‘If something exists you can probably get it in London, but there’s one thing that lots of people living in London can’t have – a kitty.

‘We thought long and hard about who would really benefit from having a cat café in London.

'I see commuters walking on their way to and from the station stopping to pet the neighbourhood cats, and since I am unable to own a cat myself due to my current flat and long hours I understand the desire to have a cat around.'

Cat cafes have been a massive hit in the east with hundreds now open in China, Japan and Taiwan

The café is aimed at the vast number of office workers who have landlords that don’t allow pets, small living quarters and long working hours and who may pine for a cat companion but are unable to own one.

While it would also undoubtedly be a hit with tourists, novelty seekers and parents with small children.

Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium would have an opulent Victorian decor to help both customers and kitties relax in the height of luxury.

Their website explains the concept behind the café: ‘It's not just about being able to play with the cats. It's about the whole experience: a small indulgence, a place to forget about your day and unwind. It's about coming in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair, a hot cup of tea, a book, and a cat.’

But what about the furry stars at the centre of the cat café - the cats themselves?

Lauren says: ‘Cat welfare is really important to us. In particular, we want to make sure we can house cats who don't have a home to go to.

King of the cafe: The cats would be specially chosen to ensure they enjoy human company, and the cafe would provide a home to cats who don't have one

‘We're also working with the Mayhew Animal Home to choose cats that will be happy in the environment that has lots of people in it, and we're working with them to define a really solid care plan to make sure they're cared for.’

Indiegogo.com is an international crowd funding site which uses social media to raise money for various innovative ideas.

So far the campaign has raise £3,291 out of the £108,000 needed to get the café off the ground.

They have just 44 days left to raise the remaining funds or they won’t receive any of the money contributed.
