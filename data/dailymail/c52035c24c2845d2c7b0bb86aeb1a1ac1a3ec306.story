Intense fighting has continued through the night in eastern Ukraine - shattering the fragile ceasefire agreement which was due to begin at midnight.

Both pro-Russian rebels and government troops have accused each other of violating the deal signed by the country's leaders on Thursday.

Heavy artillery was fired from an area manned by Russian citizens according to Ukrainian security service chief, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko.

Meanwhile, rebels accused the Ukrainians of deploying artillery shortly after midnight.

The Donetsk News Agency quoted a senior rebel official as saying the Ukrainian forces garrisoned in Debaltseve and fired mortars at rebel positions.

'In the interests of preventing the death of the civilian population, precise fire is being deployed toward the enemy's positions,' He was cited as saying.  

26 people, including four civilians, have been killed during heavy fighting across eastern-Ukraine in the last 24 hours.

Ceasefire: From midnight, troops on either side are supposed to be abiding by the agreement thrashed out in Minsk on Thursday

The separatists desperately tried to grasp as much territory as possible before the ceasefire negotiated by European leaders in Minsk was enforced at midnight. 

The Ukrainian military has reported 120 separate attacks in just 24 hours and one child reportedly died when a nursery was shelled by rebel forces.

Fighting was particularly intense around the government-held railway city of Debaltseve on Saturday. The area was besieged by separatist forces who say they do not consider battles for the town as a violation of the ceasefire.

The US ambassador to Kiev Geoffrey Pyatt has produced satellite images which he says show Moscow's role in the escalating violence.

The images appear to show Russian anti-aircraft batteries and artillery near Debaltseve - 45 miles north of Donetsk the regional capital. 

He said: 'We are confident these are Russian military, not separatists.'

The government-held town has been on the receiving end of dozens of artillery and rocket salvos in the 24-hour period after the peace deal was sealed Thursday by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France. 

Intense shelling was witnessed on Friday along the highway north of Debaltseve, which remains the town's only land link with the rest of government-controlled territory

Interfax-Ukraine news agency quoted Petro Mekhed, Ukraine's deputy defense minister, as saying separatist forces had been tasked with hoisting their flags over Debaltseve, as well as the key port city of Mariupol, before the ceasefire takes hold.

Satellite images: Pyatt - who claims Russian troops along the border are planning to deliver a large shipment of supplies to rebels in the country -  said: 'We are confident these are Russian military, not separatists'

'There has been no lull, moreover rebels continue attacks on Debaltseve,' military spokesman Anatoly Stelmakh said in a television interview.

The Ukrainian military separately said the situation remained tense in parts of the contested Luhansk region. 

Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt has said: 'I fear the ceasefire will not last and in that event the best next step would be to press for international intervention and for a United Nations monitoring force to deploy to Ukraine in a bid to prevent further fighting.

'While Britain should commit troops to this force if invited, in the interests of neutrality it would likely be better that these soldiers were drawn from Germany and France.'

Earlier Lord Dannatt described the sale of Saxon armoured troop carriers to Ukraine as 'nothing short of immoral', as the vehicles were so decrepit as to be 'quite useless'.

But it isn't just towns on the border which have come under attack: shells have landed as far as Artemivsk, a government-held town 25 miles behind the front line. 

Associated Press reporters saw the body of a child killed after rocket fire hit a nursery there, and regional officials said the child and one other civilian died in the attack

It is hoped the ceasefire will bring an end to the fighting, which broke out almost a year ago and has left 5,000 dead.

From a minute after midnight, a sizeable buffer zone between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels will start to be created.

Each side is to pull heavy weaponry back from the front line, creating a zone roughly 30 to 85 miles wide, depending on the calibre of the weapons. 

The withdrawals are to begin Monday and be completed in two weeks.

Other thorny political questions, including a degree of autonomy for the disputed eastern regions, are to be settled by the end of the year.

The peace deal suggest an amnesty for people involved in the conflict, but the vague terms of that provision will likely be provoke further disagreements. 

Speaking to parliament, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said amnesty would not be granted to anyone suspected of committing crimes against humanity.

'This is an absolute position that was unambiguously underlined during negotiations,' Klimkin said.
