Jose Mourinho paid tribute to Sporting goalkeeper Rui Patricio after his side's 1-0 win at Estadio Jose Alvalade.

The Portuguese stopper made several superb saves, including brilliantly denying Diego Costa and Oscar when they were clean through on goal. 

And Mourinho, who went over to the keeper at the final whistle, said that without Patricio Chelsea could have scored four or five times.

'I'm not going to repeat the words because they'd be censored,' said Mourinho when asked what he had said to Patricio. 'It was something to do with spoiling the evening, spoiling the night.

'There were great saves from Patricio. Games like this can end up 4-0 or 5-0, but it ended up 1-0 and a well managed goal.'

Mourinho, on his return to Sporting where he worked early in his career, reflected kindly on the club that had given him a chance as an unknown.

'These were happy days when I was here at Sporting. I made many friends. I don't forget my friends.

'It's very good to be with them. I had a chance to speak with Marco (Silva, the Sporting manager) and "link" with him.'
