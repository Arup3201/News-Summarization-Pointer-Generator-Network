A 15-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to helping murder the parents of his friend's girlfriend with a sledgehammer because they would not let the couple see each other.

Jamall Vaughn, who was 14  when Margaret Schobert, 59, and Jeffrey Schobert, 56, of New Franklin, Ohio, were bludgeoned to death, has signed a guilty plea for aggravated murder.

Prosecutors have said Vaughn and then-18-year-old Shawn Ford Jr. walked eight miles from Akron to New Franklin, where they retrieved a sledgehammer from the couple's garage after climbing in through a window.

Authorities say Mr Schobert, a health-care lawyer, was the first to be killed when he was struck 14 times with the hammer in his own bedroom during the April 2013 attack.

He also had several superficial knife wounds believed to have been inflicted by Vaughn.

The teens then used Mr Schobert's cellphone to text Margaret Schobert and urge her to come back to her lakeside home from a hospital where she was staying with her adopted daughter, Chelsea.

The daughter had been stabbed and had her skull fractured ten days earlier by Ford because she had refused him sex at a party, prosecutors said.

She was in the hospital for a month and originally said that another man had attacked her.

Despite her parents' protests, Ms Schobert and Ford were dating at the time.

The parents had grown wary of the influence Ford, who had a rough upbringing, had over their more affluent daughter and at one point put a GPS device on her car.  

Vaughn, who was going to be tried as an adult, drank soda and played video games while he and his friend waited for Mrs Schobert to return so they could kill her. 

Ford killed the couple because they would not allow him to visit Ms Schobert in the hospital, prosecutors said.

The Schoberts' bodies were found after 2pm, when workmen who had an agreement to enter the house discovered them.

Vaughn also pleaded guilty aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery. 

Mrs Schobert's watch and ring were stolen during the incident, along with money and the couple's SUV, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.

The prosecutors have recommended that Vaughn be given consecutive sentences for the two lesser charges, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. 

This means that he could serve 52 years before being eligible for parole.

A jury found Ford, who is now 20, guilty of aggravated murder last October and then voted to recommend the death penalty. 

A judge will decide whether to send Ford to death row or to give him life in prison with or without a chance at parole. No sentencing date has been set.

The jury at his trial recommended death, though Ford's attorneys have argued that Ford should not be executed because of his low IQ.

Vaughn's trial had been scheduled to start Monday. He could not have received a death sentence because of his age.

Attorneys and prosecutors are not permitted to comment about the case because of a judge's gag order.

Relatives of the Schoberts said they did not want to comment before Vaughn's sentencing. 

As of late last year, Ms Schobert was serving 30 months in prison for drug trafficking after buying a large amount of cocaine with a new boyfriend.
