One of the teenage girls critically injured in a parasailing accident earlier this month has left hospital to continue her treatment in her home state.

Alexis Fairchild was discharged from Bay Medical Center in Panama City, Florida on Thursday to return to her Indiana home.

The 17-year-old will continue rehab for her horrifying injuries after she and friend Sidney Good smashed into a 13th floor Florida condominium when their parasail line snapped free on July 1.

The girls suffered head trauma and lacerations. Miss Fairchild had serious back injuries and Miss Good had trauma to her neck.

Miss Good is due to have reconstructive surgery on her face but no date has been set because she is still unable to get out of bed, her family told the News Herald of Panama City. She will remain the Florida hospital.

An investigation is ongoing into the incident.

The teens' fathers Eric Good and Mike 
Fairchild said during a press conference last week that their girls were showing steady signs of improvement but still 
have a long way to go.

Their parents said in a joint statement, 'Both girls sustained head 
trauma as well as multiple severe lacerations. Alexis has severe back 
injuries and Sidney has neck trauma.

'However, we are fortunately seeing 
some positive signs from both Sidney and Alexis.'

'Alexis was able to walk today 
with a walker and the assistance of a physical therapist and she walked 
into Sidney's room to visit.

'Sidney is still in critical condition, but 
we are seeing small signs of progress. She is able to open one of her 
eyes and communicate to us with nods and gestures,' said the Good and 
Fairchild families.

'We truly can't say enough about the outpouring of kindness and concern we've received from so many.'

The accident on July 1 that put both girls in hospital horrified onlookers.

The two lifelong friends were on holiday from their hometown of Huntington, Indiana and were parasailing together when the boat their parasail was attached to dropped anchor due to unusually high and dangerous winds.

However, the parasail rope snapped free from the boat and the girls began to scream as they drifted at the mercy of the wind.

They were taken higher and higher and then the two terrified teenage girls crashed into the balcony of a 13th floor condo then collided
 with power lines before landing on top of a car in a nearby parking 
lot.

Earlier
 in the day, Alexis Fairchild had taken to Twitter to speak of her 
delight at her Florida vacation on the Gulf shores, writing 'Beach Day!!
 Its seriously sooo beautiful here!'.

'These two little girls were just screaming bloody murder,' said Rick McGee speaking to Indiana News Center.

'I could see they were going to contact the condo, and they did strike it on the gulf side.'

The two teenagers have both gone through a series of surgeries to save their lives and in a piece of good news, their friend Allie Marks took to her own Twitter feed to write that 'Sid opened one eye this morning tried to take her tube out. Alexis is in surgery or her back. Keep praying!!'
