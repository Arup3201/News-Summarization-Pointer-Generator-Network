Consumers who shop for bargains at overseas stores online to avoid paying GST could soon see an end to cheaper prices, the government has announced. 

Tony Abbott’s new Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has revealed plans to review the tax exemption on goods bought overseas that are worth less than $1000, The Australian reports.

If the exemption is scrapped, shoppers could see the online prices of household goods such as TVs, books, clothes and small electronic appliances like cameras shoot up.

His announcement, which came on Boxing Day – the most important shopping day of the year - has been hailed as significant by The Australian Retailers Association, who have been lobbying to close the tax ‘loophole’ for over five years.

Assistant Treasurer Frydenberg said the review of the tax-free status of goods purchased over the internet from international retailers was an ‘issue very much in the context of local jobs’

‘You do want a relatively level playing field ... My sense is that we are seeing local retailers with one hand tied behind their backs,’ he told The Australian.

Goods purchased from online retailers that are worth less than $1000 are not subject to the goods and services tax.

Australian retailers have for a long time complained that the GST loophole gives their overseas counterparts an unfair price advantage and have been lobbying state and federal governments to reduce the tax-free threshold.

NAB estimates Australians spent $16.3 billion on online retail in the 12 months to November 2014.

This level is equivalent to 6.8 per cent of spending at traditional bricks & mortar retailers as measured by the ABS (excluding cafés, restaurants and takeaway food) in the 12 months to October 2014.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that in the year 2012-2013, consumers travel, accommodation, memberships or tickets of any kind were the most common type of purchase for both males and females.

The second most popular online shopping items for females were clothes, cosmetics or jewellery (59 per cent), in comparison to males second most popular purchases of CDs, music, DVDs, videos, books or magazines (50 per cent).

Australian Retailers Association’s director Russell Zimmerman has welcomed the move

The Australian Retailers Association’s director Russell Zimmerman told Daily Mail Australia he feels confident that the government will take action against the tax exemption.

‘The remarks I’ve heard so far are quite strong. I think the government are quite concerned about the loss of revenue not being collected,’ Mr Zimmerman said.

He said the LVIT loophole is costing thousands of retail jobs in Australia and that a further 33, 000 jobs will be lost in 2015 in the discretionary retail sector, having already lost 80,000 jobs since 2007.

‘The government is desperately in need of revenue; they’ve made that very clear.’

Mr Zimmerman explained that Australian shoppers are buying a huge range of products from international retailers online.

‘I think it’s virtually everything and anything… books are a big issue with imports from overseas. We have some very good online book sellers in Australia, why should they be penalised against the likes of Amazon or whoever it may be?’

‘It’s time we saw some action,’ he added.

The Abbott government is not the first to review the loophole; the most recent inquiry was in 2009.

Director of Campaigns and Communication at consumer advocacy group Choice, Matthew Levey, said that Mr Frydenberg’s announcement on Boxing Day was more a ‘restatement of where their position has been for a while.’

He explained the government has been reviewing how to impose a GST on overseas purchases in a way that doesn’t cost them more to implement than it would to do nothing.

‘We’ve yet to see any proposal on how you can put GST on small transactions that is cheaper than the money you are spending on people to collect it,’ he said.

Mr Levey explained ‘if the issue here is about local retailers feeling uncompetitive, then we should look at what’s making them uncompetitive… we support the idea of a level playing field.’

‘We don’t want to penalise consumers for no benefit,’ he added.
