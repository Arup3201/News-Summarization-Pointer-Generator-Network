Not even half of Australia's 16-year-olds can correctly identify what event Anzac Day commemorates.

Only 46 per cent of Year 10 students can correctly name Gallipoli or a battle in World War One as the reason for Anzac Day memorials across the country. 

More than 5,000 students were asked: 'On Anzac Day each year Australians remember an event that happened on 25 April, 1915. What happened on that day that Australians remember?'

Only 46 percent of Year 10 students can correctly name Gallipoli or a battle in World War One as the reason for Anzac Day memorials across the country

The students answered the question as part of a civics and citizenship test for the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA).

The majority of Year 10 students said Prime Minister Tony Abbott was Australia's head of state instead of the correct answer which is the Queen.

Almost half of Year 6 students could correctly name the Governor-General as the Queen's representative here in Australia.  

Despite thousands of Australians heading to Gallipoli each year for Anzac Day commemorations, less than half of the country's 16 years old can recall the reason for it 

'It's pleasing to see that half of our young Australians have met or exceeded the challenging but achievable proficiency standard in civics and citizenship although the remaining half have yet to do so,' ACARA CEO Rob Randall said. 

The test highlighted the positive attitude students have towards citizenship in the country.

More than 90 percent of students endorsed the notion that Australia should support the cultural traditions and languages of Indigenous Australians.

More than 5,000 students were asked: 'On Anzac Day each year Australians remember an event that happened on 25 April, 1915. What happened on that day that Australians remember?'

Two-thirds of Year 6 students reported an interest in what was happening in other countries, 70 percent for global issues, 69 percent for environmental issues in Australia and 65 percent were concerned about what happens in the local community. 

When asked about important behaviours for good citizenship, 80 percent of students rated participation in activities such as protecting the environment, promoting human rights and learning about Australia's history and activities.

'Students tend to experience civic engagement first within their school context, with these experiences important for fostering future participation in a democratic society. It is pleasing to see that so many students have positive attitudes to participation as active citizens,' ACARA Chair, Professor Barry McGaw said.
