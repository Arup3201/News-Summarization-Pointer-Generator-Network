They may rise at 3.15am and work in silence, but even that isn't enough to ensure the Trappist monks of Assumption Abbey keep up with demand for their now legendary fruitcake.

Using a recipe given to them by the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's chef, the monks have been hit with so many orders that their website  now tells customers to come back in February 2013.

In between contemplation, study and prayer, the Missouri Trappist monks bake over 20,000 of 'America's finest fruitcake' each year, and inject each one with an ounce of Puerto Rican rum. But it's just not enough.

Careful with that rum: Brother Simin and Brother Tobia, right, inject freashly baked fruitcakes with rum before glazing them and topping them with red and green colored grapes and pecans (Less than one ounce of rum is used per fruitcake)

The Trappist monks called on the 
services of ex-chef to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor Jean-Pierre Augé in the1990s when ventures
into farming and concrete production failed to yield enough profits for the
self-sufficient monks.

They
were offered eight recipes and settled on the one that requires 70 per 
cent fruit and nuts to 30 per cent batter. The fruit is marinated in 
burgundy wine for days and the finished product injected with rum.

The monastery's website says: 'Mr. Augé's assistance, and his generosity in providing the recipe and ideas for production, gave the monks the impetus to go forward with the Assumption Abbey Fruitcakes.Assumption Abbey Fruitcakes are the dark, rich, traditional style of fruitcake.

'They are baked slowly and aged under the careful supervision of the monks.

'Everything, from marinating the fruit, to mixing, to baking, to packaging, to aging, to mailing is done right at the monastery by the monks.

'Assumption Abbey is not a commercial enterprise. It is a way of life, and that way of life, combined with the careful work of the bakers, insures a dedication to high quality that makes Assumption Abbey Fruitcakes among this country's finest.'

The monastery runs a Family Brothers Program that enables men from all religious backgrounds to participate in the monastery's spiritual life.

They can live either part-time or full-time and take part in all aspects of the Trappist tradition, including residing in private rooms, sharing a simple and frugal lifestyle, working, participating in the Divine Office and Eucharist, community gatherings and discussions.

On Sundays there is not Work. Throughout the day there are several periods of time for personal prayer, reading and study, walks and creative activities. A light breakfast and a light evening meal are available.

Bakers with a Trappist twist: The monks rise early to make 125 cakes a day, and 15 years and thousands of cakes later, there is no denying the little monastery and its 12 monks have created a niche market
