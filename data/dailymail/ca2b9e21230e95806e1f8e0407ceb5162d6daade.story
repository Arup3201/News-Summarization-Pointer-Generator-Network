Mario Balotelli is open to a move to Arsenal after his agent revealed 'anything is possible'Â  this summer.

The Italy striker, who scored the winner against England in the World Cup on Saturday night, features highly on Arsene Wenger's shopping list as the manager looks to sign a prolific striker.

Arsenal have made contact with his agent Mino Raiola with regards to arranging a deal for the Milan striker and Raiola didn't deny the interest.

'Arsenal are a fantastic club,' Balotelli's agent Mino Raiola told Sky Sports. 'Will a transfer happen? Anything is possible.'

Arsenal want to find out what the cost of the deal would be before fully pursuing a swoop for Balotelli.

AC Milan are keen to offload the striker as they look to ease their wage bill this summer.

Arsenal have been made aware of Balotelli's availability and are ready to strike if the deal makes financial sense.

Meanwhile, the Gunners will explore the option of a taking a player from Manchester United as the Old Trafford club step up their interest in Thomas Vermaelen.

The Gunners are monitoring the futures of United pair Chris Smalling and Tom Cleverley, who could be surplus to requirements at United.

And a player-swap deal could persuade the Gunners to part with their captain.

Arsenal want to sign a new centre-back before letting Vermaelen leave.

New United boss Louis van Gaal wants to sign the Belgium international as he looks to put his stamp on the Old Trafford squad.

Van Gaal is confident he can lure the central defender away from the Emirates Stadium ahead of next season.

Unshakeable: Mertesacker and Koscielny's form has seen captain Vermaelen frustrated on the sidelines

Vermaelen grew increasingly frustrated at his role at Arsenal last season as he played second fiddle to first choice central defensive pairing Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny.

But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is unwilling to let his skipper leave the club without having a replacement lined up.

Having already lost right-back Bacary Sagna, who was the club's fourth choice centre-back, to Manchester City, the Gunners boss does not want to leave himself short of cover in the position.

Vermaelen has a year left on his current Arsenal contract, meaning he can leave the club for nothing next summer - a scenario the Gunners are keen to avoid.

The Gunners are ready to offer Vermaelen a new contract this summer, but without the guarantee of increased first-team opportunities next season, the Belgian is likely to be reluctant to sign.

Cardiff defender Steven Caulker is being considered by Wenger, while Manchester City right-back Micah Richards, who can also play centre-back, could also be an option.
