Are Manchester United right to sack David Moyes?

One thing Louis van Gaal would be able to guarantee, should he indeed now become Manchester United’s next manager, is a good relationship with the finest footballer at Old Trafford.

David Moyes would insist that he too has enjoyed a healthy rapport with Robin van Persie. He could even point to that recent interview Van Persie gave in which he declared his support for Sir Alex Ferguson’s successor.

But the rumours have persisted, the fact of the matter being that Van Persie felt let down by Ferguson for retiring only a year after convincing him to move from Arsenal to Old Trafford. Moyes just wasn’t Fergie and so the problems apparently began.

Dutch courage: Van Gaal recently made Van Persie captain of the Holland international team

Whatever the truth about that 
particular situation, the relationship between Van Gaal and Van Persie 
seems to be built on more solid foundations.

It
 has developed from Van Gaal’s decision to appoint the United striker as
 captain of the Dutch national team and has grown into something fairly 
rare in the sphere of modern football.

Imagine
 Roy Hodgson inviting Steven Gerrard to join him on a scouting mission. 
Well, that is what Van Gaal has asked Van Persie to do in recent weeks, 
having him attend matches between Vitesse Arnhem and Ajax, and PSV 
Eindhoven and Feyenoord.

Van
 Gaal has taken advantage of the fact that Van Persie has been using the
 medical services of the Dutch FA in Zeist to recover from injury. But 
even so, it points to a special bond between the two men.

In
 the past Van Gaal has not always enjoyed such a relationship with his 
senior players. For instance, during his first spell at Barcelona he 
clashed with both Rivaldo and Luis Figo.

Even
 with Van Persie there was a shaky start. Before his first game as 
Holland manager, Van Gaal asked the players to explain their roles in 
the debacle that was their Euro 2012 campaign. When Van Persie chose to 
remain comparatively silent on the issue, Van Gaal opted to leave him 
out of that opening encounter with Belgium, preferring Klaas-Jan 
Huntelaar up front.

But over time he grew to like and admire Van Persie and within a year had made him his skipper ahead of Wesley Sneijder.

As
 things stand today, United have nothing signed with Van Gaal. On Monday the Dutchman was said to be off to Portugal for a holiday, having 
already asked Tottenham for more time to consider an offer he is 
understood to have received. It is, say sources in Holland, one of three
 offers on the table, with the other believed to be United and the third
 a club in mainland Europe.

United,
 say those same sources, would be his preference. He has long had an 
ambition to work in England and was quite at home with the idea of 
becoming United manager when he was named among the favourites to 
succeed Ferguson back in 2002. Then, of course, Ferguson changed his 
mind about retiring.

Second season syndrome? Van Persie has been a shadow of his former self for United this term

Van 
Gaal delivered a speech at The Savoy in January at the Football Writers’
 Association tribute dinner for Jose Mourinho. He was said to have seen 
this as a chance to impress the English media.

And
 he was impressive, in both his eloquence — when English, of course, is 
not his first language — and his success in striking the right balance 
for the audience.

Van Gaal has won 19 trophies in 23 years of management.

He has won the league at every club he has managed.

While he 
displayed enough humility to suggest that Mourinho has surpassed his own
 achievements to become the outstanding manager in Europe, we were left 
in little doubt here was the Dutch master to Mourinho’s apprentice.

He
 told the story of how Mourinho became his assistant at Barcelona. At 
their first meeting in a restaurant in the Catalan capital, he was 
struck by this young, relatively diminutive Portuguese who dared 
remonstrate with the club president for his treatment of the outgoing 
Sir Bobby Robson, despite the presence of the new manager.

Impressed by Mourinho’s loyalty, not to mention his courage, he concluded immediately this guy would be perfect alongside him.

The
 story he told at The Savoy was followed by an acknowledgement of the 
manager Mourinho  has now become. ‘I am always the “arrogant Louis van 
Gaal” but now I am humble,’ he said. ‘Now, he is better than me.’

But
 United are sure to draw confidence from the confidence Van Gaal 
clearly has in himself. He is arrogant, and such arrogance will be 
required to occupy a role that has proved so uncomfortable for Moyes.

He
 would have the benefit of being the man who follows the man who 
followed Ferguson. But after almost 30 years in coaching, the 
62-year-old Van Gaal has his own way of doing things, and United could 
find him a little too uncompromising. He likes to run a club from top to
 bottom. ‘From the first team to the laundry,’ said one Dutch observer on Monday. ‘Even the board.’

Forward thinking: The Dutchman started the revolution that led to Bayern becoming the world's best

Van Gaal lifts the 2010 Bundesliga trophy - the last of 18 major honours he has won

That
 said, his methods have delivered great success. He is credited with 
starting the revolution that has seen Bayern Munich become the best team
 in Europe, despite the fact he was eventually dismissed in April 2011.

It
 is pretty much his system they continue to play, and he signed Arjen 
Robben, promoted younger players such as Thomas Muller and converted 
Bastian Schweinsteiger from a winger to a defensive midfielder.

It would appear to be a reason why United now want him.
