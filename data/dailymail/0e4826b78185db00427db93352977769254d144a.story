The patient environment, which has remained largely unchanged for decades, has been redesigned in such a way as to improve healthcare - and to look a lot cooler.

The project, called Patient Room 2020, has been undertaken by non-profit design firm NXT Health who wanted to combine the knowledge of doctors with the flair of designers.

The idea, funded by the US Department of Defense, was developed following a collaboration of over 35 industry partners that began four years ago in New York.

NXT Health Patient Room 2020 is a collaborative design project for a next-generation inpatient care environment. The aim is to improve patient experiences and optimise caregiver performance

All surfaces were designed to reduce areas where bacteria could hide. Non-porous solid surfaces and anti-microbial fabrics supplied also limit dirt that could lead to infection

The end result is a prototype that demonstrates how the integration of various parts of a patient's room could redefine the medical experience in the 21st Century.

The minimalistic design, with curved white panels and aluminum fixtures, provides a glimpse of the future.

But not only does it look good, every aspect of the layout has been designed with functionality in mind.

The 'Patient Companion' tablet can be used by patients to call for help, check their medical progress and control environmental factors. It also provides entertainment through computer games

The bathroom is an adaptable design that features a sliding door system which can be reconfigured based on care needs. A direct path of travel between the bed and bathroom is illuminated and lined with grab bars

For instance, non-porous solid surfaces and anti-microbial fabrics limit germs that 
could lead to infection.

Alongside this, the surfaces are designed to reduce areas where bacteria can hide and flourish. 

Smart sensors know when a nurse enters the room, and turn the sink red reminding them to wash their hands

The patient dining table contains a tablet PC, known as 'Patient Companion', that features voice activated controls.

It can be used by patients to contact nurses, check their own medical progress and control settings such as light and temperature. They can also be used to play computer games. 

To prevent falls, a direct path of travel between the bed and bathroom is illuminated with light and lined with grab bars.

When a nurse enters the room, the sink turns red reminding them to wash their hands. The floor is also softened to prevent injury if a fall does occur

The bathroom itself is an adaptable concept that features a sliding door system which can be reconfigured based on care needs

A full-scale prototype of the concept is currently on show at the DuPont Corian Design Studio in New York.
