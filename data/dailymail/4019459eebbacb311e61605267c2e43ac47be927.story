The son of Liverpool FC manager Brendan Rodgers was one of four footballers who sexually assaulted a drunken teenager and took pictures as a ‘permanent record of their conquest’, a court was told yesterday.

Anton Rodgers and three others allegedly assaulted the 19-year-old woman in a hotel room after a night out celebrating a cup win, a jury heard.

The Liverpool boss was at the Old Bailey yesterday for the opening of the trial of Rodgers, 19, and fellow Brighton and Hove Albion players Lewis Dunk, 21, and George Barker, 21.

Accused: Anton Rodgers, left, and Steve Cook, right, were among the group who allegedly assaulted a drunken 19-year-old woman in a hotel room as they celebrated a victory for their club

Denial: The footballers, including George Barker, left, and Lewis Dunk, right, deny sexual assault

Former team-mate Steve Cook, 21, who now plays for Bournemouth, is also among the accused. All four men deny sexual assault.

Rodgers, Barker and Dunk, from Brighton, and Cook, from St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, also deny voyeurism.

The court heard how the men had taken 
the woman to the Jurys Inn Hotel in Brighton and allegedly waited until 
she was asleep before assaulting her in a ‘deliberately humiliating 
way’.

The woman discovered photographs of herself on Rodgers’ phone the next morning after she had borrowed it to call her sister.

She did not tell police for six months
after the alleged assault ‘through fear of repercussions’, but finally 
did so after another player at the club hinted at putting the images on 
YouTube.

Richard Barton, prosecuting, said: ‘This is a case of a group 
of men taking advantage of a woman who through a combination of drink 
and tiredness, ended up unconscious..

‘She was not in a condition to resist,
give consent or prevent things happening.’ He added that it was not a 
case of a young woman who did things when drunk that she later 
regretted.

The players had met the woman in a 
Brighton nightclub called Lola Lo as they celebrated a victory in the 
Sussex Senior Cup in July 2011.

Mr Barton told how the woman had woken
up semi-naked in the hotel room at 11am the following morning in a 
double bed with Anton Rodgers, who was wearing only his underwear.

Another player, Ben Sampayo, was asleep on a single bed in the room, which had been booked for them by the club.

Hearing: The court heard the woman could remember waking up in a hotel room the next day in a double bed next to Anton Rodgers, pictured here arriving at court with his father Brendan Rodgers

Location: The Jury's Inn Hotel, in Brighton, where the offences were said to have happened

The woman had tried to telephone her 
sister but her mobile phone battery was dead.

Mr Barton said she asked 
to use Rodgers’ BlackBerry phone. He was reluctant at first but 
eventually agreed.

On the phone, Mr Barton said, she found ‘a whole series of photographs of a young woman wearing a pink dress’.

In some, there were semi-naked men around her, he added.

‘She looked at some of the many 
photographs and then realised to her horror that the unconscious woman 
in the pink dress was in  fact herself.’

The woman, now 21, gave evidence against the four players from behind a curtain.

She told how she had woken up next to Rodgers, adding: ‘I felt ashamed, embarrassed. I couldn’t believe it had happened.

‘I was angry. I told him to delete them. He said he was not going  to delete them. He was not at all concerned.’

Mr Barton added: ‘The indifference 
shown towards her by Rodgers and the others that morning is indicative 
of the group’s overall attitude to her and the events the night before.’

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
