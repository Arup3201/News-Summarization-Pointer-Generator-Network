A top secret rocket has blasted off from the Californian coast - which experts believe was carrying a hi-tech spy satellite that can see at night and through bad weather.

The Delta IV rocket lifted off from the Vandenberg Air Force Base, about 130 miles north-west of Los Angeles, at 4.12pm.

Its exact 'classified' cargo has not yet been revealed, with the National Reconnaissance Office keeping mum about the purpose of the mission.

Classified: A top secret rocket has blasted off from the Californian coast - which experts believe was carrying a hi-tech spy satellite that can see at night and through bad weather

Fans: Official coverage of the lift-off was cut after just three minutes because of the classified cargo, but that did not stop people from across the area filming the launch and posting it onto YouTube

Classified: The exact nature of the cargo has not yet been revealed, with the National Reconnaissance Office keeping mum about the purpose of the mission, and security was higher than usual at the base

The NRO also ordered the United Launch Alliance to cut off the live broadcast three minutes after lift-off to prevent

But hordes of fans gathered, across the area, to film and upload footage of the blast off to YouTube. Intelligence analysts believe the rocket carried a hi-tech radar imaging satellite capable.

Charles Vick, space policy analyst with the Globalsecurity.org think tank, said the U.S. was gradually replacing its fleet of older, heavier radar reconnaissance satellites with smaller ones.

Such radar satellites would be able to zero in on countries of interest and see details that typical Earth satellites cannot, he added.

Hi-tech: Rocket launches are not unusual, but this one has sparked speculation because of the high levels of security surrounding it

Launch time: The Delta IV rocket blasted off from the Vandenberg Air Force Base, about 130 miles north-west of Los Angeles, at 4.12pm yesterday

Yesterday's launch involved reconfiguring the rocket to add on two strap-on boosters to provide more thrust.

The protective nose cone enclosing the payload also had to be made larger.

ULA, the joint venture of rocket builders Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing, said it was the first time the Delta IV had been launched this way.

Locked down: Security was high for the latest launch of the Delta IV rocket with a classified cargo

The launch was delayed nearly a week as engineers worked to fix an issue with the upper stage engine.

As it involved classified cargo, no details were available about whether the rocket was boosted to its intended orbit.

The next launch out of Vandenberg will be a flight test of the Minuteman III on April 10.
