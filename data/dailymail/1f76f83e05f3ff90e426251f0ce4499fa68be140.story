While the construction industry has traditionally been thought of as a 'man's world', two women have launched a range of female workwear to encourage young girls to feel confident considering a future in the workforce.

Carpenter Laura Madden and apprentice Juanita Mottram launched their Brisbane-based company eve Renovations in 2010 out of a passion to shake up the construction industry- where only 1% are women- with a solely female workforce.

'Laura has been a builder in the industry for 15 years, and she can say without a doubt that the change in that time has been marginal. For us nothing changed because, really, nothing has changed,' Juanita told Daily Mail Australia.

In the 25 years between 1987 and 2012, the proportion of women represented in the industry has remained the same, a statistic which both worried and motivated the pair to go a step further with their business. 

The women launched eve Workwear, a range of clothing suitable for women in the industry that was made specifically for them to work in, while still looking good.

'Our company does domestic and commercial renovations and we obviously wanted to look good when we went to clients houses for quotes,' Juanita said.

'I come from a marketing background and meetings were big deal, you wanted to look the part, so I couldn't understand why it was acceptable to turn up in daggy clothes that didn't fit,' she said.

'Women's workwear was just men's workwear with a different label on it. They didn't fit right, were too big, and were in horrible colours.' 

So Laura and Juanita decided to do something about their situation and have workwear specifically made for them, and after having praise heaped upon their designs, made up their minds to extend the trend to other women.

The self-funded workwear range launched in 2011, releasing small-scale ranges which have now expanded after two long years of hard work

The self-funded workwear range launched in 2011, releasing small-scale ranges which have now expanded after two long years of hard work.

The range bridges the gap between workwear and streetwear, offering shirts, pants, jackets, singlets and hi-vis necessities that fit well and are still practical.

'In any job that a woman decides to do, dressing and feeling confident and proud of what you're doing is so important,' said Juanita.

'A lot of study goes into being a carpenter or electrician and women should be proud of that,' she said.

Juanita said that having clothing that fits well and is specifically designed for women also adds a sense of belonging in a male-dominated industry.

'We've had some great responses and stories from women doing all different things, from truck-drivers to make-up artists,' she said. 

'We're hoping that with our renovations and clothing company that we get noticed for what we're doing and make the industry more of an option for girls.'

'There are so many great options- women can design furniture, or do something technical like become an electrician. There are so many different areas that women may find they're suited to, it's not all heavy lifting.' 

Both Laura and Juanita have male mentors are very positive about the way they have been treated in the industry, and say that men are a lot more accepting of women on site.

However Juanita said that she wants to encourage more women to actually get on the site in the first place, which she believes starts in high schools.

'Both Laura and I have stayed with the tools rather than moving into management or administration roles, because we are trying to show girls in high school that trades are an option,' she said.

'We are trying to create change, and if you don't take risks then nothing will change.'

Juanita's favourite item from the eve Workwear range is the brand new workpants

Juanita's favourite item from the eve Workwear range is the brand new work pants.

'They are so versatile, and have stretch in the fabric which makes them super easy to wear. We describe them as chuck them on the floor and chuck them back on. They can just be worn and worn,' she said.

'They were inspired by vintage workwear which comes through in the buckle on the back, and the big pockets which crosses them into streetwear and makes it feminine.'

Juanita said that the company also wants to encourage both men and women to look at jobs they are interested in, rather than along gender line.

'Take gender out of the equation. Some guys are good at make-up and some girls are good at being electricians,' she said.

'It shouldn't matter if you're male or female. It should be about the role you want to pursue.'
