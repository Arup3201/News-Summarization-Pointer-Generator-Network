Company boss Mike Waterton, 43, posted pictures of a luxury holiday just days after his firm was wound-up still owing workers their wages

The boss of a company that went bust days before Christmas was branded ‘heartless’ yesterday after he allegedly took a luxury  holiday while his ex-employees went unpaid.

Mike Waterton, 43, put photos on his website appearing to show him in Cancun, Mexico, less than a week after his temping agency was wound up.

He claimed this morning that the photos were actually taken by a friend who was on holiday in Mexico.

Former staff say they were still owed hundreds of pounds after the business in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, closed without warning on December 11.

Five days later, Mr Waterton, who is also an author and motivational speaker, posted pictures apparently showing him in a pool at the CasaMagna Marriott resort – his face obscured by his book 50 Grades Of Pay: How To Earn More Money. 

Another photo showed two cocktails on a beachside table. The hotel charges in Cancun up to £960 a night for its most luxurious rooms overlooking the sea.

Mateusz Matczak, 20, a former employee of TempNetwork, told a local newspaper: ‘I was owed £470. My mum didn’t get paid either – we worked together and live together so we didn’t have money for anything.

'We had to borrow money from friends … The agency sent a message saying they were “sorry for this situation and we will try to help you find another agency”.

Many of the workers are from Poland and had to cancel trips home due to unpaid wages. Another worker, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I was meant to be going to Poland for Christmas, but when TempNetwork closed down I was owed nearly £800.

‘I had to cancel the holiday because I didn’t have enough money to even get a taxi to the airport. This man is in Mexico while all his workers are owed their wages – he is a heartless and friendless man who knows no shame.’

Agatka Wszeborowska, 27, who also worked for TempNetwork, said she is owed £1,200 by the firm, adding: ‘We are all in a very bad situation and he’s going for a holiday like nothing happened.

‘A lot of people are really angry and he’s writing books about how to be a millionaire.’

A Citizens’ Advice Bureau spokesman said: ‘It’s a difficult situation for employees when an employer becomes insolvent. Hopefully we will be able to help the m to recover any money they are owed.’

Mr Waterton was unavailable for comment when his local newspaper, The Kent and Sussex Courier, reported the row.

But today he claimed on his blog that he had not visited Mexico and the photos were taken by a friend and were posted on his website to promote his book.

He added: 'In no way, shape or form was this intended to offend anyone and I apologise for any offence taken. I was in the UK during this time sorting out business.'

He also wrote: 'The sudden and quick demise of Temp Network is regrettable. Despite our best intentions, we were unable to reach an agreement with in which we could keep trading.

'Even with the prospect of putting over 100 people out of work just before Christmas, our hands were tied.'
