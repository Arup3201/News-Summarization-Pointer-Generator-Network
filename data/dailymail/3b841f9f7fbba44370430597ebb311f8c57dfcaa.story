Suing: Dr Daniel Ubani is demanding 2,800 euros after a conference speech was disrupted

A disgraced doctor who killed a British man due to an appalling blunder over his painkillers is suing the dead man's son in Germany because he missed a post-conference dinner.

Rory Gray and his brother Stuart disrupted a speech he was giving at a conference on plastic surgery in the German town of Lindau in 2010, calling him a 'charlatan and killer'.

Both men were arrested but later released.

Dr Daniel Ubani is demanding 2,800 euros - plus legal and court costs - from Rory Gray who lives in Germany.

Ubani, who lives in the former western German industrial town of Witten, came to the UK in 2008 as a locum because he wanted extra money. 

He was working for an out-of-hours medical service  when he gave 70-year-old David Gray a fatal injection in Cambridgeshire.

Ubani confused the amount of painkiller he should give renal patient Mr Gray; in the end he gave him ten times the dosage of diamorphine he should have done.

Mr Gray died within minutes at his home in Manea, Cambridgeshire, on 16 February 2008. 

Coroner William Morris later ruled his death 'gross negligence and manslaughter' and issued 11 recommendations to the Department of Health for the improvement of out-of-hours GP services

An arrest warrant was issued in the UK for Ubani to be extradited to stand trial. 

But he cut a dubious deal with German prosecutors that allowed him to receive a fine - by post - together with a nine month suspended jail sentence for causing death by negligence.

Tragedy: David Gray died after being given a massive overdose of painkillers by Dr Ubani

His ability to work in Germany was never questioned despite the fact he was struck off by the GMC in Britain.

He refused to attend the inquest into his victim and the medical hearings which barred him from ever working in Britain again.

The German Doctors Chamber, the equivalent of the General Medical Council in the UK, still wants Ubani struck off - but they are powerless to force him to go while he still retains the support of the local authority which licenses him.

David Gray's sons Dr Stuart Gray, who lives in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, and his brother Rory, who works as a European Space Agency scientist in Darmstadt, have been campaigning to get Ubani struck off in Germany.

Now Rory has two weeks to appeal the cash demand from Ubani, who runs a cosmetic clinic as a sideline. 

He said: 'Ubani is claiming for money to compensate him for missing the function in the evening after the Lindau conference that he had paid to attend.

And for compensation for not being paid at Lindau for his talk.

'I find it disgusting that he is still allowed to practice.'

Horrified: Rory Gray (pictured with his girlfriend Ingrid Krautwurst) said it is 'disgusting' Dr Ubani is still allowed to practice after his he allegedly fed his father a massive overdose of pankillers
