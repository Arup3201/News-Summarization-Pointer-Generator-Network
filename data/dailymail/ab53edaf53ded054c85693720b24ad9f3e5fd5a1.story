Claiming: Linda Kozlovska, 32, was paying a reported £100-a-week rent for her old home 
in Lincolnshire

A Latvian mother-of-ten receiving £34,000-a-year benefits has won her fight for a bigger taxpayer-funded home - worth three times the value of her current property, it emerged today.

Linda Kozlovska, 32, is moving her family from their £48,000 three-bedroom property in Boston, Lincolnshire, to a town in South Yorkshire where the average house costs around £150,000.

The single self-employed cleaner’s new rented home is believed to have four bedrooms and be located near a town centre, reported The Sun.

But the family's move prompted calls for welfare system reform that would ensure taxpayers ‘are not funding a lifestyle for claimants that they couldn't afford for themselves’.

Miss Kozlovska told the newspaper: ‘We are very happy here, but I don't want to say any more.’

And one of her neighbours in Boston told the Sun: ‘She is Latvian like me and she told me that she had got herself a house in Yorkshire.

‘She sounded very pleased with herself. I don't know how she did it but I wish I knew.’

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of campaign group the TaxPayers’ Alliance, told MailOnline: ‘Our welfare system is in urgent need of repair.

‘Families up and down the country make decisions about where they live and whether to have more children every day.

'So, taxpayers cannot keep being asked to pick up increasingly large bills to subsidise bigger houses for claimants.

‘It's time that the welfare system was reformed to protect taxpayers, by ensuring that they are not funding a lifestyle for claimants that they couldn't afford for themselves.’

MailOnline first reported on the case of Miss Kozlovska in September 2012, four years after she had arrived in Britain with three of her children in 2008.

She admitted at the time that she was unhappy living in the Boston property - because she had had three more children and four others had moved over from Latvia.

‘I have ten children living here with me,’ she said last year. ‘I’m the only adult. I am on the council waiting list, but we’re still here.

'They don’t have a big enough house. I want a bigger house. I don’t like it here. When we moved in it had bed bugs.’

The council had appeared to be supporting her, with one councillor saying last year that he was ‘sympathetic’ to her demands.

Miss
 Kozlovska paid £100 in rent a week to a private landlord for the house 
in Boston, which was managed by the local borough council.

She
 was claiming working tax credits, child tax credits and child benefits.
 Every week, she received £527 in child tax credit and working tax 
credit as well as £127 in child benefits.

In total, she received £34,000 a year from the state – far more than the average UK salary of just over £26,000 before tax.

The amount is also much higher than the £9.26 per child she would have received each month if she were still living in Latvia.

There, couples can claim up to £1,865 per baby, but payments dip after children reach 18 months.

Miss Kozlovska lives with Russandra, 17, Liene, 14, Julian, 13, Sandija, 12, Marko, 
nine, Janis, seven, Diana, six, Rolands, three, and twins Edvard and 
Alan, two.

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We are working hard to restore fairness to the welfare state.

'The benefit cap will mean claims are limited to the average household income of £500 a week and people have a clear incentive to get into work and back on their own two feet.

'Housing benefit changes now stop massive claims. A safety net is firmly in place, but claimants cannot have rents paid that are well out of reach for hard-working families.'
