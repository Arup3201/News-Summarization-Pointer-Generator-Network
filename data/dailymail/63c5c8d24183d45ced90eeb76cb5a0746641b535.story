Cheryl Cole last night denied using an Irish company to help avoid paying up to £200,000 in UK tax.

The singer’s spokesman claimed she had created Tara Entertainment Ltd to deal with her international earnings simply because her accountant is Irish rather than as a way of paying a lower rate of company tax. 

Tara, which was set up in 2001, and its British-based parent company CC Entertainment International, were put into voluntary liquidation in the last two months, prompting speculation the star is keen to avoid accusations she is dodging UK tax.

However last night Cole’s publicist Sundraj Sreenivasan insisted the change in her financial arrangements was because her accountant Alan McEvoy had moved to London. 

Mr Sreenivasan added that the star had been introduced to Mr McEvoy by Girls Aloud former manager Irish impresario Louis Walsh.

In a statement he said: ‘Cheryl has used the same accountant in Ireland for 13 years. The accountant was recommended by Louis Walsh, who at the time managed her as part of Girls Aloud. Her accountant has recently set up an office in London so Cheryl’s Irish company has been dissolved.’

The change in Cole’s tax affairs came just days before George Michael, Gary Barlow and dozens of other celebrities learned they are liable for millions in unpaid taxes after HMRC ruled an investment vehicle they had used was a tax avoidance scam.

While Cole’s actions are legal, the last accounts for Tara showed assets of £2.5 million at the end of 2012, suggesting the star had funnelled at least this much through the company.

If this was the case the singer would have avoided paying £200,000 in tax that would have been owed in Britain. This is the difference between Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate compared to the 21 per cent rate in the UK.

Documents for the liquidation of the company, CC Entertainment – which in 2013 declared only £1 in net assets – now show it has £1.88 million funds, which is likely to be paid to Cole as the company’s sole owner.

She has married her French lover Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, 33, after a whirlwind three-month romance.
