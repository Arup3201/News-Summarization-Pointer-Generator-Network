It's been 21 years since Today show hosts Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel quizzically asked 'what is internet, anyway?' when confronted with their first email address live on air.

Now, they're back poking fun at their infamous gaffe in a new commercial for BMW's i3 electric car.

The ad - which will air during the Super Bowl this Sunday - begins with the 1994 Today show clip in which Couric and Gumbel are visibly confused after being made to read an email address for the first time. They both seem hung up on the @ symbol. 

'What is i3'? Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel team up again to play baffled curmudgeons in a new BMW ad called 'Newfangled Idea'

Couric and Gumbel in 1994 were hilariously confused when confronted with their first email address live on air at the Today show

'I wasn't prepared to translate that. That little mark with the 'A' and then the ring around it,' Gumbel says. 

'... Katie says she thought it was about.'

'Or around. Around or about,' Couric chimes in. 

Gumbel then asks: 'What is internet, anyway? What do you do, write to it like mail?'

The i3 is BMW's new electric car, built from carbon-fiber instead of steel and made in factories powered by wind turbines

Couric returned to the Today show on Monday to talk about the infamous segment and her new BMW ad

Couric then asks a producer: 'Alison, can you explain what internet is?'

Couric appeared on the Today show Monday to talk about the commercial and the clueless clip that has since become internet lore. 

'There's people who look back and say that in hindsight, there was this transitional technology," she said. 'It was really so new back then and then we see how it evolved.'

Fast forward to 2015, Gumbel and Couric seem equally baffled as they sit behind the wheel of a new i3 electric car.

'What do you mean there's nothing under the hood? Katie said she thought this was a car,' Gumbel says.

He then asks: 'What is i3, anyway?'

Couric gets on her cellphone and says: 'Allison, can you explain what i3 is?'

The tagline to the spot is: 'Big ideas take a little getting used to.'

The 1994 clip is especially ironic now that Couric, who jumped to CBS and then ABC after leaving the Today show in 2006, hosts an online-only news cast for Yahoo! News.

Yahoo.com wasn't even a registered internet domain in January 1994 when Couric and Gumbel bumbled their way through their first email address on air.

Gumbel is the anchor of HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel - a show he has worked on since 1995.
