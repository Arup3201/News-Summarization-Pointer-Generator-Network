They spent the Christmas holidays slogging across the seas - and were left without fresh water for two of the seven-and-a-half gruelling weeks they rowed across the Atlantic.

But six injured British servicemen, including four amputees, showed off their sheer mental and physical strength by arriving in Barbados' Port St Charles yesterday.

The ocean conquering heroes, who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, were greeted by cheering crowds as they completed their 3,000 mile challenge to raise £1million for wounded comrades.

Arrived: Six British servicemen, including four amputees, showed off their sheer mental and physical strength by completing a row across the Atlantic by arriving in Barbados' Port St Charles

Heroes: The ocean champions were greeted by cheering crowds as they completed their 3,000 mile challenge to raise £1million for wounded comrades

They endured no running water, comfortable bed or toilet - and all have sores from exposure to sea salt and claw hand - the almost-arthritic effect of gripping the oars so tightly.

But life on the boat was remarkably similar to that experienced while on tour, said amputee Lt Will Dixon, platoon commander with Third Battalion, The Rifles.

He said: 'We've all been on operations in Iraq or Afghanistan and you go through the same things that you miss.

'It's always clean running water, clean fresh bedsheets, hot showers and you always promise yourself you won't take those things for granted.

Proud: The crew endured no running water, comfortable bed or toilet - and all now have sores from exposure to sea salt and claw hand - the almost-arthritic effect of gripping the oars so tightly

Greeted: The crew were welcomed into Barbados by former servicemen

'Then you find that you start to, until you're back in that situation.'

Dixon, who had to learn to walk again with a prosthetic limb after losing his left leg below the knee when an IED detonated under his vehicle in Afghanistan in December 2009, said men slept in shifts, eating 800-calorie freeze-dried meals.

But when the boat's desalinator broke, three weeks after they set off from La Gomera in the Canary Islands, they had no way to make fresh water to add to their food and so had to ration themselves.

They ate 'snack packs' made up of sweets, cereal bars, fruit and nuts, and energy drinks for 14 days. Dixon added: 'That kind of thing affects the crew in different ways.

'I came into this row pretty much overweight so for me the calories has not been as important but I really struggled when we were low on water.

'I seem to have lost a lot of weight, about two stone. But a couple of members of the crew could have done with my rolls of fat, they've been very hungry at times.'

And when it came to relieving themselves, he said it was time for the crew to go back to nature.

'Essentially we squatted over the edge
of the boat, so it's straight into the sea. But if the waves were 
going, at least you got a bit of a bidet effect.'

Thousands of miles across tempestuous seas from one continent to another, the Atlantic Challenge is considered one of the toughest trials on the planet.

Travelling along the route fabled to have been taken by Christopher Columbus more than 500 years ago, teams cover nearly 3,000 miles on the journey between La Gomera in the Canary Islands and Port St Charles, Barbados.

Setting off in December to avoid coinciding with the end of the hurricane season, teams aim to get the maximum benefit from the easterly trade winds and Atlantic currents.

In 1966 Sir Chay Blyth and John Ridgeway performed their legendary open-boat row across the Atlantic Ocean in English Rose III.

The trip took 92 days and it laid the foundation for the Atlantic Challenge.

Since then more and more people have tried it - this year's Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge began on December 4 with 17 teams.

Boats are 23ft long and 6ft 6in wide, with only a small cabin for protection against storms.

Three
other members of the crew are also amputees, including corporal Neil 
Heritage, 31, who had a double above-knee amputation after being blown 
up in Iraq in November 2004.

Corporal Rory Mackenzie, 30, lost his right leg in a roadside bombing in Basra City in January 2007.

And Lance Corporal Carl Anstey, 26, needs a leg brace to walk after a blast from a rocket-propelled grenade in Afghanistan in January 2009.

The team, dubbed Row2Recovery, was completed by able-bodied ex-captains Janvrin and Mackenzie, 32 and 33.

Writing on the team's blog yesterday, Cpl Heritage said: 'I've got some tough moments ahead, like mastering the art of walking again on my prosthetics after losing a lot of muscle on my stumps as a result of being sat down for extended periods, but it will have been worth it.'

Dixon added: 'I think it's going to be similar for all the amputees.

'I have lost a lot of weight around my stump.

'I row in a prosthetic and had to pad that out with socks and have to keep adding socks each time I lose weight.

'It's fine for sitting and rowing but I think it might be difficult when I try to walk.'

Queen Elizabeth II sent a message of support to the team. Her Majesty said: 'Please convey my warm thanks to all the members of the Row2Recovery team on the occasion of them reaching the end of their row across the Atlantic, in aid of injured soldiers and their families. 

'I heard of the trials and tribulations on your journey and, in return, I send my good wishes to you all for the successful completion of the challenge.'

The crew were one of 17 teams from across the world crossing the Atlantic as part of the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge.

Money they raise is to be distributed between three military charities: Help for Heroes, the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA) and ABF, The Soldiers' Charity.
