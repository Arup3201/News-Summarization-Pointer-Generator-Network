Rescue teams who previously saved lives in the Japanese earthquake and tsunami spent eight hours freeing a dog that had become trapped in a cliff.

Otis, a dog which had been rescued from Romania, got stuck after he ran into an old smugglers' tunnel in the cliff in Margate, Kent, and got wedged, 15ft from the entrance.

The Sussex and Kent County Technical Rescue Team spent eight hours digging their way into the confined space on their hands and knees to rescue the one-year-old dog. 

A specialist search and rescue team who saved the lives of people in the Japanese Tsunami spent more than eight hours digging a one-year-old rescue dog out of a cliff in Margate, where the animal had got stuck 

The team was involved in the 2011 Japanese rescue effort.  

They were called after his owner Heather Tait was unable to reach Otis and the fire brigade was also unable to free the animal.

Miss Tait, 51,had tied her three dogs up as she briefly visited the nearby yacht club last Wednesday, but when she returned Otis had disappeared.

She said: 'Otis had run off into a small hole in the cliff.

The team worked for eight hours to widen the hole in the cliff so they could free Otis who had been trapped

'I looked in there and couldn't see him, I thought that was it.

'I could hear him yelping and barking.

'The fire brigade came and did what they could but they just couldn't get him out. But then the search and rescue team came and spent hours trying to dig him out.'

The rescue team used shovels to widen the space to pull Otis free.

Heather's partner Jo Murray, 45, said: 'I could hear him crying the whole time, he was really miserable in there.

'But eventually they managed to grab his lead and pulled him to safety.'

The Margate couple, who are both artists, are fostering the terrier-type stray,  from charity Angels 4 Dogs.

Miss Tait added: 'He's very traumatised but I think he's going to be fine thanks to the amazing work from the rescue teams. I think I will adopt him.'
