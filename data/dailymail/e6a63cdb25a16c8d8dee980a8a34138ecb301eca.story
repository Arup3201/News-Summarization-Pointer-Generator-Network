A court has heard mother-of-one Alison Morrison (pictured) who was allegedly murdered by her next-door neighbour, was stabbed 'at least' 35 times 

A mother-of-one who was allegedly murdered by her next door neighbour was stabbed at least 35 times, a court heard yesterday.

Charity executive Alison Morrison, 45, was allegedly ambushed as she walked to work by 48-year-old satellite TV engineer Trevor Gibbon, of Harrow, London.

Mrs Morrison, a senior manager for consumer charity Which? and vice-Chair of the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board, was fatally stabbed in Alexandra Avenue, Harrow, northwest London on the morning of December 18.

At the time residents reported hearing piercing screams and police were called to the attack.

Mrs Morrison was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, but died from her injuries. 

A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as multiple stab wounds. 

Yesterday Gibbon appeared at the Old Bailey by video link from Wormwood Scrubs prison for a preliminary hearing.

No bail application was made and he was remanded in custody by Judge Steven Kay QC until a plea and case management hearing on March 10 next year.

Prosecutor Brian O'Neill, QC, said the attacker 'inflicted some 35 or so stab wounds to her torso as well as numerous other stab wounds of a defensive nature.' 

Gibbon was arrested in Lincolnshire later the same day and charged with murder.

He did not enter a plea at yesterday's ten-minute hearing in court number ten.

Mrs Morrison grew up in Bedhampton, Hampshire, and lived with her husband Cedric and 16 year-old son Kori in Harrow.

Tributes have been pouring in for Mrs Morrision, who has been described as a 'wonderful and caring' mother and wife who worked hard to reduce crime in her community.

Her family said in a statement: 'Alison was an inspiration, a warm and loving person who will be deeply missed by her husband and son.

'Her devastating loss as a result of this senseless attack is also felt by all the family, local community and all who knew her.' 

Mrs Morrison grew up in Bedhampton, Hampshire, before moving to the capital after finishing university.

She was planning to return home to see her family to celebrate Christmas this week.

Her brother-in-law Lee Richards said her 46-year-old husband called the family to tell them the tragic news.

He said: 'We are in shock. It couldn't have happened to a nicer lady.

'You know what sisters are like - you can't separate them.

'They received a phone call from Cedric to say there had been a situation.

'They left what they were doing and went straight up there.'

Mrs Morrison's sister Paula received the news minutes after stepping off the plane at London Heathrow airport following a 10-day holiday in Cuba.

Mr Richards said his wife Julie Brathwaite, a 52-year-old mother-of-two who runs a cleaning business, was inconsolable.

He said: 'She's in a mess. I have left the sisters together - that's the best way.

'Alison was here a couple of weeks ago. My family were due to go up this weekend to the Olympia horse show.

'They were going to stay at Alison's home.

'A couple of years ago they lost their dad.It's taken them this long to get over that and now this has happened.' 

Mr Richards described Mrs Morrison as a 'wonderful, caring mother' to her teenage son Kori.

He said she died a lot of voluntary work for her community, and was the vice-chairwoman of her local Neighbourhood Watch scheme.

Her full-time job was as a senior manager at consumer organisation Which?, a position she moved to London for after studying a degree.

He said: 'She was fun-loving and happy. She was sensible and responsible - this is a disaster.'

Bianca Brathwaite, 24, Mrs Morrison's niece, added: 'She was everything you could ask for in a woman, she was strong and always stood up for herself and her family and is loved dearly.'

David Perry, leader of Harrow Council, described her as a 'key member of the board'.

He said: 'Alison Morrison was passionately committed to creating a safer Harrow through her work with the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board and as a community champion, and it is terrible news that she has lost her life in this violent way in a borough she cared so much about.

'Alison's colleagues on the Safer Neighbourhood Board are absolutely shattered by this news, as are the staff of Harrow Council. Alison was a key member of the board and a tireless advocate of its work.

'We will do whatever we can to help the police. In the meantime, our thoughts are with Alison's family.'

Chief Superintendent Simon Ovens, borough commander for Harrow, said: 'I had the pleasure of knowing and working with Alison in her role as the vice-chair of our borough's Safer Neighbourhood Board.

'She was held in high regard locally, and truly cared about the borough. Her friends within the local community will be devastated by her loss.
