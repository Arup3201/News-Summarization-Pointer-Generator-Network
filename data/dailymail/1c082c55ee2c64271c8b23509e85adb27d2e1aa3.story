If you're still frantically searching for the perfect Christmas present for a little girl in your life, your prayers may have been answered - as long as you have £9,000 to spare.

Leonard Martin, 68, has put this elaborate Georgian manor dolls' house - complete with a Swarovski crystal chandelier, hand-stitched carpets and marble flooring - on sale after spending an incredible 26 years working on it.

The model maker estimates he has spent £6,000 - and more than a third of his life - working on the model.

Leonard Martin, 68, has spent 26 years - more than a third of his life- working on this elaborate dolls' house, which he has named Langdon House

The model maker says he has spent £6,000 on the Georgian manor model - and wants to sell it for £9,000

It all started for Mr Martin in 1987 when, bored at work, he doodled a picture of his ‘perfect home’ on a scrap of paper - and started working on 'Langdon House' in miniature size.

He has worked on the house, which is 6ft 2ins long and 3ft 6ins tall, for between five and 12 hours a day since starting.

The miniature property has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a sitting room, a dining room and a hallway all filled with tiny furniture.

There are miniature beds, sofas, 
cupboards, baths, toilets and even tiny oil replica paintings - including one of the Mona Lisa.

Mr Martin, who used to own a military memorabilia shop and lives in Charlton Marshall near Blandford, Dorset, said: ‘It was all my own design and was made to look like a Georgian house and I started building it in the shop.

‘When it was quiet I would work on it and some people would joke and say that if anyone was to visit my shop they would end up being gold leafed themselves.

‘I probably spent anywhere between five and 12 hours a day and it was to commemorate my mum, Pearl, and my brother Kenneth, who both died.

‘It is all built to a scale of 1:12 and about 90 per cent of it is handmade - it isn't really a dolls house but more of an architectural build.

‘Some people who see pictures up close actually think it is real.’

After moving six times since he started working on the manor, Mr Martin has been finishing it off in a workshop at the end of his garden

Some of the items in the house were purchased from dolls' house furniture makers and other pieces were hand-made by Mr Martin, including a huge banquet of miniature food.

He made meats, bread, cakes and pies from clay and then baked them in the oven before painstakingly painting them to look realistic.

Mr Martin also spent months ensuring the decorations look perfect by coating the plaster ceilings with 24ct gold leaf and laying individual planks of wood for the floor.

He even spent hours working on the outside by affixing 720 quoin stones and over 4,000 mock stones made from cardboard.

And even though he has finally put the finishing touches on the property, he has already started building another.

He said: ‘People have asked me if I will miss Langdon Hall when it sells, because I have worked on it for so many years and put my heart and soul into it, but I can do another.

‘I really enjoy making them and going to the workshop so in fact I have already started on my next one, but this time it won't be nearly as big.'
