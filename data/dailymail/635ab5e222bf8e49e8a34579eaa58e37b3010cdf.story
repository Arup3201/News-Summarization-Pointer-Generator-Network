Hundreds of babies may be dying on NHS labour wards every year due to a severe lack of staff, a top doctor has warned.

Dr David Richmond, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said it was ‘legitimate’ to ask whether it was the reason for notoriously high rates of mortality and brain damage.

Figures show that 300 babies die a year during birth or shortly after with a further 1,200 suffering brain damage or other major health problems.

Deaths: Dr Richmond said many mothers are still 'losing their babies unnecessarily'

At the same time NHS maternity wards remain desperately understaffed and cannot cope with the baby boom coupled with births becoming more complicated due to older and more obese women.

Dr Richmond, who represents Britain’s 6,000 obstetricians, said: ‘We need to look at the possibility that understaffing, labour wards that are under pressure and busy, and stretched facilities may be a factor in some of these poor outcomes.’

He added that there were occasions when staff made ‘small, relatively innocuous mistakes [which], when combined, lead to a disaster.’

Dr Richmond also criticised Britain’s high rate of stillbirth – almost 4,000 a year or about 10 a day – as an ‘appalling’ and largely preventable loss of life.

It is the third highest rate out of 35 high income countries – only France and Austria are worse.

He said that although the numbers have fallen recently, ‘it’s still a lot of mums in the 21st century that are losing their babies unnecessarily.’

And figures for 2009 – the latest year available – showed that 144 babies died during labour with a further 134 dying within a week of the birth.

The birth rate in Britain has risen by 22 per cent in the last decade and Dr Richmond said maternity units were being ‘squeezed’ because the numbers of doctors and nurses has not kept pace.

He said there needed to be an extra 800 consultants to provide care round the clock and intervene when complications arise during the labour.

‘If you need to have a consultant there at three in the afternoon, why is it not equally important to have a consultant there at three o’clock in the morning? In my view it is,’ he told the Guardian.

But he admitted that a lack of NHS funding meant there was no realistic realistic possibility of consultant numbers rising from 2,200 to the ideal of 3,000.

He also called for action to reduce the 1,200 ‘near misses’ which occur every year when complications occur during labour and birth that often leave the baby temporarily but dangerously deprived of oxygen.

The condition, which doctors call ‘severely hypoxic,’ involves babies facing the risk of brain damage and profound lifelong disability.

‘These are babies that are born in very poor condition and may have a very slow heartbeat or very restricted breathing or not respond to stimulation,’ he said.

Dr Richmond said: 'Lots and lots of women travel through pregnancy and labour safely but occasional tragedy occurs'

Each such case can leave the NHS having to find millions of pounds in compensation to pay for the substantial cost of providing lifetime care for the child.

He said the loss of life and long term injuries that resulted from these complications represent ‘1,500 individual tragedies’ and constitute ‘an ongoing tragedy involving potentially avoidable very serious outcomes.’

Asked why the baby deaths occur, Richmond replied: “The best analogy is to describe them as plane crashes.

‘Lots and lots of women travel through pregnancy and labour safely but occasional tragedy occurs.

'These tragedies are always ‘multifactorial’ and require thorough investigation to establish why. It is not uncommon that a series of small relatively innocuous mistakes, when combined, lead to a disaster,’ he said.

‘There are often no easy fixes. The challenge is to be willing to share these experiences, learn from each other and invest in safety.

‘There is a big difference: flights are often cancelled for safety reasons – medical emergencies during pregnancy and labour can’t be cancelled.’

In addition to the lack of doctors, the Royal College of Midwives has estimated the NHS needs an extra 5,000 midwives to guarantee safe care.

Dr Dan Poulter, the health minister, said childbirth on the NHS was safe and perinatal mortality was declining.

‘The numbers of stillbirths and infant mortalities are at the lowest levels since 1993, but there is still more to do.

'The NHS is a safe place to give birth, with women reporting high levels of trust and confidence in staff.’
