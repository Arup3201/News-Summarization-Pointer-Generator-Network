The Argentina squad look eager for a World Cup final against Brazil after they sang about how the host nation are being 'bossed around' and have been 'crying since Italy' World Cup 1990.

The footage shows Argentinian players and officials jumping on top of benches, swinging shirts and chanting after their 1-0 win over Switzerland in extra time to make the quarter-finals.

Brazil and Argentina are favourites to win the tournament with Coral and, if the two are to meet, it will have to be in the World Cup final at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on June 13.

Singalong: The Argentina squad were in high spirits after their 1-0 win in extra time over Switzerland

Banging: The Argentina side bang the walls and floor to make plenty of noise after making the quarter-final

Warning: Argentina have reminded Brazil of their past failings and want to add another in the World Cup final

All together: The players and officials were in a buoyant mood after Switzerland but face Belgium next

Banging the drum: Coral have Argentina and Brazil as favourites for the tournament

'Brazil, tell me how it feels

To be bossed around in your own home

I swear that even if years pass

We will never forget

That Diego (Maradona) out-skilled you

That Cani (Claudio Caniggia) surprised you

You are crying since Italy (World Cup 1990) until today

You are going to see (Lionel) Messi

The World Cup will be ours

Maradona is greater than Pele'

The chant, sang passionately by Argentina's camp, won't be music to Brazil's ears, however.

They remind the host nation how Diego Maradona 'out-skilled' them, how Claudio Caniggia 'surprised' and how Argentina knocked Brazil out in the 1990 tournament.

The worst insult, though, may be that they insist 'Maradona is greater than Pele'.

Argentina, although deliriously happy in their changing room on Tuesday, must gather themselves for their next task on Saturday.

They left it late for Angel Di Maria to see them through with just two minutes of the added 30 to go against Switzerland, but Belgium stand in their way of making the final four.

Brazil, on the other hand, have Colombia.

Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari is tasked with keeping a sensational James Rodriguez quiet -Â  a challenge easier said than done after the 22-year-old stormed to become leading contender for the Golden Boot with five goals.

All laughs: Lionel Messi jokes in training but it will all become serious come Saturday against Belgium

High spirits: Messi (right) laughs with Fernando Gago during Argentina's training session on Wednesday

Same again: Argentina will hope they can chant their song again on Saturday evening

Group: Argentina may face Brazil in a mouth-watering World Cup final on June 13 should it go to plan
