Two Victoria's Secret models suffered an awkward fashion mishap last night when they turned up to New York Fashion Week's amfAR gala wearing the same dress.

Lais Ribeiro, 24, and Heather Marks, 26, both looked stunning - albeit unoriginal - as they arrived at Cipriani Wall Street in their matching teal cut-out Cushnie et Ochs gowns, which retail for $2,395, and even accessorized them with similar black clutches.

The New York-based label, launched in 2008 by designers Carly Cushnie and Michelle Ochs, is clearly proving popular. On the previous night over in Nashville, Tennessee, models Emily Ratajkowski and Sara Sampaio sported an identical frock by the same designer - this time a $1,495 orange number - at the Sports Illustrated 2015 Swimsuit bash.

Both Ms Ribeiro and Ms Marks stand at 5ft 11in, are represented by Women Management and are based in New York.

Brazilian-born Ms Ribeiro, whose ample bosom better filled out her dress, wore her hair tied back and teamed her smoky eyes with red nail varnish; while Canadian-born Ms Marks wore her blonde hair loose and opted for pale make-up and nails.

Both models have worked for Victoria's Secret in the past. Ms Marks has appeared in several of the lingerie giant's ads and walked in its 2006 fashion show.

Ms Ribeiro has also shot a number of campaigns for Victoria's Secret, and walked the 2010, 2011 and 2013 shows. She was scheduled to appear in the 2012 show too but sprained her ankle during rehearsals and had to pull out. 

Had the girls been lent their Cushnie et Ochs gowns directly from the designers, whose label is favored by the likes of Karlie Kloss and Michelle Obama, they likely would have been warned they would be matching.

It is possible, therefore, that they hired the dress from Rent the Runway, where it is currently available costing $300 for a four-day rental.

Popular indeed! The slinky floor-length Cushnie et Ochs frock was also worn by model and cookbook author Padma Lakshmi, 44, in New York last October (pictured)

As for model and Gone Girl star Ms Ratajkowski, 23, inadvertently matching her dress with Ms Sampaio, yet another Victoria's Secret model, this duo embraced their fashion faux pas with open arms.

The brunettes spent most of the night posing side-by-side, with Ms Ratajkowski joking on Instagram: 'Yep were #twinning! Decided to rock it together and be each other's dates! (sic)'
