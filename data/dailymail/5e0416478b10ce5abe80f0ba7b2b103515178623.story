A singing doctor has been handed £8,000 of taxpayers' money to make a music video in which he tells people how to use their inhalers.

Dr Tapas Mukherjee, who is based at Leicester Royal Infirmary, was praised two years ago for his home-made video, 'Breakfast at Glenfield' - a take on Deep Blue Something's Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which explained guidelines for treating asthma patients.

He has now been given a NHS grant to pay for a professional film crew to create a new video to help asthma patients use their inhalers properly.

But the Taxpayers' Alliance has labelled the grant 'nonsense', claiming that the funds could be put to better use at a time when the NHS is facing budget freezes.

'Singing doctor' Tapas Mukherjee has been awarded an £8,000 grant by the NHS to produce a music video advising asthma sufferers on how to use their inhalers. He is pictured in a previous video he funded himself

Dr Mukherjee, 33, is keeping details of the new song under wraps until it is broadcast next year.

He said: 'The aim will be to help educate people about when and how to use inhalers.

'If it helps to change people's behaviour it could lead to fewer hospital admissions and the cost of the project could easily be recovered.

'Research shows that there is a lack of awareness among people as to when and how to use their inhaler.

'The next logical step, having made a video aimed at staff was to create a video to show patients how to manage their condition.'

For his previous video, Dr Mukherjee used his mobile phone, a home computer and help from this friends to create what became a YouTube hit.

The grant was awarded after Dr Mukherjee was praised for creating a YouTube video about asthma guidelines

The doctor insists the video could cut the number of people going to their doctors or hospital and so will recoup the funding invested in it

He took the lyrics from Breakfast at Tiffany's by Deep Blue Something and turned it into Breakfast at Glenfield, the name of a Leicester hospital, to explain the guidelines medics should follow in treating asthma patients.

The video won the British Thoracic Society Innovation in Education Award 2012 and the NHS Expo/Network Casebook II Innovation Award 2013.

Although the stars of his new video are all staff at Leicester's hospitals, a professional film crew has been hired to shoot it.

The project was one of only 46 out of a total of 600 applications which received a share of a £2.5million NHS England fund to improve care.

Dr Mukherjee said: 'This video is a little more serious and while I want it to include humour I don't want to offend anyone and I don't want the video to be patronising.

'We are aiming for hundreds of thousands of views. The last video showed me there was an appetite for this sort of thing.'

The doctor won two awards for his previous video, which he made with his mobile phone and home computer

Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said: 'Once again frontline clinicians and NHS managers are proving that, given the chance, the NHS can be one of the most innovative health services in the world.'

But Andy Silvester, Campaign Manager for the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be baffled that, with finances so tight, the NHS is dishing out recording contracts to its own staff.

'While Dr Mukherjee may well have a delightful singing voice, it's nonsense to prioritise a grant like this when front-line staff are feeling the pinch of a necessary pay-freeze.

'The NHS must cut out this kind of waste, as well as removing layers of middle-management and unnecessary bureaucracy, if it is to remain sustainable as our population ages.'
