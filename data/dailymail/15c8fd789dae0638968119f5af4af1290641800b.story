Anti-fracking protesters could be forcibly removed from their camp by bailiffs today after a court ruled against them.

After a two-day hearing the landowners were granted a possession order for the land where an energy firm is carrying out drilling.

IGas was granted permission for exploratory gas drilling at the site and said it is seeking methane and shale gas but has no immediate plans for fracking.

Police officers work to remove protesters who chained themselves to a coffin at the entrance of IGas exploratory drilling site at Barton Moss, where landowners can now evict demonstrators

But scores of anti-fracking protesters descended on Barton Moss, near Salford last November, erecting a large camp of around 60 tents and caravans along the farm track.

In the past four months more than 80 protesters have been arrested and charged with a variety of offences including obstruction and drink-driving.

The protest is estimated to have cost £750,000 so far with Greater Manchester Police having to prioritise more and more officers to the site.

Landowners Peel Investments North Ltd served notice to the protesters last month saying they were going to the High Court in Manchester in a bid to have them removed for trespass.

They were granted the order yesterday though the judge allowed protesters leave to appeal which will be heard today at noon, after which protesters could be evicted if the appeal fails.

But the Mail understands protesters will simply move from the farm track onto nearby agricultural land and continue their opposition.

Martin Porter, of Frack Free Greater Manchester, said: ‘It may be the camp moves somewhere else, perhaps down the road. I think some people have already moved to some woods nearby.

Amid numerous stunts and protests in four months, 80 protesters have been arrested and charged with offences

The protesters can now appeal. If that fails, they will be evicted from the Salford site

‘This event was about stopping fracking around the country as a whole. We are disappointed with the decision. If we lose the appeal we will clear the site but the protest will continue.’

Fracking involves the fracturing of rock with a pressurised liquid to release shale gas, with potentially vast reserves untapped across swathes of the UK.

The Government and industry chiefs say fracking is a safe, cheap way of harvesting fuel and more environmentally friendly than oil exploration.

But campaigners say there is clear evidence that fracking causes serious air and water pollution and leads to earth tremors.

Protesters at the Barton Moss site, which lies in the shadow of the M62, have accused the police officers of violence and bully-boy tactics.

But police accused protesters themselves 
of resorting to dirty tactics after a police officer was injured by a 
‘booby-trap’ drum containing barbed wire and glass.

The protests outside Cuadrilla in West Sussex last year cost the police force more than £3million

He suffered a cut to his hand last month as he attempted to free two anti-fracking protesters who locked themselves to the concrete drum.

Peel Investments claimed the continued presence of scores of protesters would lead to ‘escalating problems’ at the site.

But the protesters argued any possession order would represent a ‘disproportionate interference’ with their right to protest under Article 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

However their claims were rejected by Judge Mark Pelling QC who said that permitting the protesters to occupy the site would be a breach of domestic law, because they did not have consent to remain there.

Campaigners had also sought to establish that the camp - which runs along a grass verge next to a road - was located on land leased by Peel to a farmer, making any possession order useless, and that they had a right to protest on the road because it’s also a public footpath.

But the judge said the verge did not form part of the lease because it had ‘no agricultural purpose’ and added the protests - which had seen protesters sat down or lying down in the road to stop traffic reaching site - exceeded ‘permissible highway use and as result constitutes a trespass against the owner of the land over which the right runs.’

Martin Burke, one of the defendants in the case, said: ‘This case is a success in the campaign to highlight the fact that fracking is highly dangerous.’

Around 1,000 anti-fracking campaigners marched peacefully through Manchester city centre at the weekend to protest against the controversial drilling at Barton Moss.

IGas is due to complete its drilling by the end of this month.

Large scale anti-fracking protests in Balcombe, West Sussex last summer went on for weeks and cost the police force more than £3m.

More than 80 people, opposed to Cuadrilla Resources’ exploratory oil drilling operation, were arrested in angry confrontations at the site.

In January Cuadrilla said it was to scrap plans to use fracking near the village because rock already contained natural fractures.
