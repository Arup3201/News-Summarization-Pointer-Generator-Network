Lady Gaga’s Born This Way album was Britain's most unwanted present this year.

In just two days after Christmas, more than 53,000 copies of the 2011 CD were sold online.

Gift-givers also wasted their money on The Inbetweeners Movie, which came second with 47,758 DVDs passed on.

Shunned: The controversial singer's hit album, which stormed the charts in 2011, was a flop this Christmas

Almost 50,000 copies of The Inbetweeners Movie DVD was traded on Christmas Day and Boxing Day

And Mumford & Sons' Sigh No More, which stormed the chart in 2009, ranked third, with Britons shifting 44,567 copies on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.

It seems the public has also fallen out of love with the Amy Winehouse classic Back To Black (listed 41,741 times), the latest Bond film Skyfall (39,587), and Pulp Fiction (37,011).

Those who found Topshop dresses and Topman t-shirts under the tree were quick to pass them on, with each traded 36,432 and 36,256 times respectively.

A further 34,019 disgruntled people took to the internet to shift a pair of Next jeans.

Rounding off the top 10, 33,478 Xbox 360 games consoles were offered up to post-Christmas shoppers on cash for clutter website musicMagpie.

Liam Howley, the site's marketing manager, said: 'The period between Christmas and New Year is always one of our busiest times of year, as people don’t want to hang onto presents they have no use for and look for ways to make money to help with January finances.

'We know some people put unwanted gifts aside to re-use next Christmas, but a lot of savvy customers take advantage of the unwanted items in the home which they don’t use. We’re here to help them de-clutter and make cash.'
