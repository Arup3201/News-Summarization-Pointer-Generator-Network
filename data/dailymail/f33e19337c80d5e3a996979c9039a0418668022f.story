Tiger Woods once said that the champions of golf are measured by their performances in the majors but there is something that even separates men like Woods from the rest. 

It is something that divides the greatest from the great, and something that we have witnessed here at Hoylake this week in the form of Rory McIlroy.

Sergio Garcia had said there is no real weakness in his game and so it proved on the lush fairways of Royal Liverpool, McIlroy withstanding what amounted to a serious attack from the Spaniard with a measured, impressively mature performance.

There were anxious moments, of course. The bogeys on five and six. Not to mention the dreadful tee shot on 13 that enabled Garcia to close to within two shots of the Northern Irishman.

But never did he allow Garcia to move any closer. Never, even when Garcia was tearing up this golf course prior to his own mistake in the bunker at 15, did he relinquish control.

McIlroy was in control from the gun to the tape over four mesmerising days, taking command of the 143rd Open Championship with a magnificent demonstration of his ability.

He has been blessed with powers few athletes possess. A degree of talent that, when harnessed, makes him simply untouchable; completely unplayable; a class apart.

At times, and certainly over the first three days, it was like watching Usain Bolt in full stride, Roger Federer at full stretch, Michael Schumacher at full throttle.

It was Lionel Messi when he had Arsene Wenger comparing him to a Playstation figure, or Cristiano Ronaldo when a moment’s improvisation produced a moment as magical as that mule kick against Valencia.

There was a moment on Sunday afternoon when Garcia dared to dream. When an eagle at the tenth was followed by an exchange of looks between player and caddie that said, ‘hey, we might just have a chance here’.

But Garcia will also reflect on this tournament and remember why, on Saturday night, he compared McIlroy to Woods at his indomitable best, and perhaps accept that he was always coming from too far back to snatch what would have been his first major.

So glorious was McIlroy he actually left the rest of the field feeling they were competing for second place in a way that only the finest athletes on the planet do. 

A few hours before delivering what Lord Coe considered the performance of the London Olympics, David Rudisha offered Timothy Kitum a few words of advice.

Rudisha informed his fellow Kenyan of his intention to become the first man to cover two laps of the athletics track in less than a minute and 41 seconds that night and suggested it would be unwise to follow him if he wanted to win a medal.

Kitum listened, let Rudisha dominate the 800m final from the gun and in the last straight picked off those foolish enough to chase the world record holder to take bronze. 

When Federer was at his peak, winning the Australian Open in 2007 without dropping a set and losing only one set en route to securing the third of his seven Wimbledon titles in 2005, the best his rivals could realistically hope for was the prize money for the runner-up. To the brand of tennis he was able to produce, a beautiful yet devastating combination of finesse and power, they had no answer.

Armed with a golf club McIlroy also combines that finesse and power, striking the ball not just with perfect timing but with the kind of precision that nobody else could match with such consistency here on The Wirral.  

It was a privilege to watch. To see those drives on the fifth on Thursday and the 17th on Friday, the second of which was just shy of 400 yards. McIlroy pointed out afterwards that Dustin Johnson had driven the ball even further on that particular fairway, ignoring the fact that Johnson is near enough a foot taller than him and built like a basketball player.

Distance, however, is not the only determining factor. Accuracy and control are vital components too, as McIlroy demonstrated on Saturday with eagles at 16 and 18 that also emphasised the importance of timing of a different kind. The timing of an attack, that one coming just as Rickie Fowler and Garcia were dropping shots. 

This is why McIlroy has become the first European golfer to win three different majors and why it felt last night like there will be plenty more to come. Beyond even a career Grand Slam.

Those close to him certainly see a 25-year-old now coming of age, just as they see significance in that recent meeting with Jack Nicklaus. Perhaps the guidance he took from the greatest golfer of all amounted to the final piece of the jigsaw in creating the champion now in possession of the Claret Jug.

All week he has oozed confidence, even when there was talk of his ‘freaky Friday’ problem after that opening 66. That afternoon in the media tent he was completely unfazed; not the slightest bit rattled. 

It is how the greatest of the greats are, whether they are on a football pitch, a running track, a tennis court or a golf course. They are different. Indeed, after one game at the World Cup, Messi was said to be ‘from Jupiter’. The same could be said of McIlroy. He already has a home there after all.
