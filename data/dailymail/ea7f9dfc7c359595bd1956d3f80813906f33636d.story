A ‘callous and wicked’ student was sentenced to 12 years in jail yesterday for throwing acid in her childhood friend’s face.

Mary Konye, 22, wore an Islamic veil that hid her face to stalk and attack Naomi Oni on her way home from work in the early hours.

Sentencing her, Judge David  Radford said the ‘deliberate and wicked act’ was ‘devastating’.

He said it was a ‘premeditated, evil and callous’ copy of the acid attack on presenter Katie Piper.

In
 a statement, Miss Oni, 22, said: ‘My attacker’s sentence will end but I
 have to live with my injuries and disabilities for the rest of my life.

'The world only sees my scars that have been left, but I have mental 
scars that will stay with me forever.’

Yesterday
 Konye, of Canning Town, East London, finally admitted throwing the acid
 after maintaining throughout the trial that Miss Oni attacked herself.

She continues to claim that Miss Oni asked her to do it so she could enjoy ‘fame and fortune’ like Miss Piper.

Before the attack: In a statement read to the court, Ms Oni described how she sometimes felt suicidal after the horrifying incident

Judge
 Radford told Konye: ‘The consequences of your deliberate and wicked act
 have been devastating for Miss Oni, causing her terrible pain and 
physical injury.

The result of your offence, as  you must have foreseen,
 was life-changing injuries.

‘This was wholly premeditated criminality against a person who reasonably believed that you were her true friend.’

He
 said she had not shown any genuine remorse and had ‘ruined [Miss Oni’s]
 trust in anyone who she believed to be a friend, that friendship being 
so wilfully betrayed by you’.

He
 added that the attack might have been driven by jealousy and that Konye
 displayed signs of a ‘stalking behavioural disorder’.

Konye,
 who hung her head and wept quietly as he spoke, will be expected to 
serve at least two-thirds of her 12-year term, but could be freed after 
eight years.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard she was ‘obsessed’ with Miss 
Oni, from Dagenham, East London, and envied her looks.

Miss
 Oni described how, going home from her job at lingerie shop Victoria’s 
Secret, she got  off at her bus stop and felt a ‘presence’ before 
turning to see someone in a niqab, or veil.

She
 felt a ‘massive splash’ as the acid was thrown at her, disfiguring her 
face, dissolving her hair and eyelashes and burning her tongue as she 
screamed.

Describing how she felt, she said: ‘Why has this happened to 
me? I work hard. Am I ugly? No one’s going to marry me now.’

Miss Oni also recalled telling Konye about the attack. Konye replied: ‘OMG. Can’t believe it.’

Scars: The injuries inflicted on by Ms Oni she says have 'turned her life upside down'

Devastated: Miss Oni said she 'broke down' after removing her bandages following surgery

Miss Oni added: ‘I just had my bandages removed and it was the first time I saw my face after surgery and I broke down.

‘I
 was crying on the phone to her and she was on the phone to me telling 
me don’t worry.’

The court heard the pair fell out when Miss Oni said 
Konye looked like a disfigured character from the horror film Wrong 
Turn.

After the attack, 
Konye posted pictures of another horror film character, Freddy Krueger, 
on a social networking site with the caption: ‘Who looks like Wrong Turn
 now?’

In a victim impact 
statement, Miss Oni said her life had been ‘completely turned upside 
down’.

Each day was a ‘challenge and a battle’, she said, adding: ‘It 
is  difficult to live with my physical appearance.

'Iam very conscious 
of it and am reminded of what  I look like every day when I see my 
reflection or the reaction on people’s faces.’

She
 said she had trouble eating and sleeping, adding: ‘I lie awake at night
 for hours on end, reliving the incident in my head.’

Mitigating, Sally O’Neill QC said Konye had a ‘difficult domestic upbringing’ and felt remorse.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Dave Whellams said: ‘The court recognised the extent of
 the injuries and trauma it has caused the  victim and we are very 
pleased.’
