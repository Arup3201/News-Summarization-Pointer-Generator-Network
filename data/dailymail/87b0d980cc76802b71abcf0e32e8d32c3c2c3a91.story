England's players wasted no time in their bid to acclimatise to the Brazilian heat as Daniel Sturridge and his team-mates enjoyed a stroll along the beach in Rio.

Roy Hodgson's men checked into the Royal Tulip Hotel, their base for the World Cup, on Sunday morning and spent time relaxing by the pool after their eight-and-a-half hour flight from Miami.

But Sturridge, along with fellow England stars Chris Smalling, Danny Welbeck and Jordan Henderson, decided to leave the five-star resort and check out the local scenery.

The England quartet were mobbed by journalists and TV crews during their time on the sand, with local kids also eager to meet their heroes in the flesh.

The players retreated back to their hotel after spending time catching some rays and meeting football-mad locals.

Hodgson's side will begin their final preparations for their World Cup opener with Italy with an open training session at the Urca military base on Monday.

England will fly to Manaus on Thursday ahead of Saturday's clash with Cesare Prandelli's side, with a pre-match press conference set for Friday afternoon.

The Three Lions also face Uruguay and Costa Rica in Group D.
