An 88-year-old pensioner died after she was left lying on a freezing cold pavement for three hours while waiting for an ambulance, it has been alleged.

It is thought Doreen Wignall fell on black ice causing a head injury as she crossed a bridge in Ludgershall, Wiltshire.

An investigation is underway into why it took Great Western Ambulance Service allegedly three hours to send an ambulance to a critically-ill pensioner

Repeated calls were made for an ambulance without success while members of the public gave her first aid - including stemming the blood with kitchen towels. People even supplied duvets to protect her from the rain.

Eyewitnesses say a paramedic turned up after 65 minutes - followed nearly two hours later by an ambulance. However, the pensioner died two days later in Salisbury District Hospital.

It is understood the family think she may have lived if the ambulance had got there sooner. 

Yesterday top Wiltshire County Councillor Chris Williams and the statutory patient watchdog The Wiltshire Involvement Network demanded the Great Western Ambulance Service conducts an urgent inquiry into the ‘unacceptable’ three hour wait.

Mr Williams - who represents Ludgershall on the council - fumed: 'The ambulance took three hours to get there which is a dreadful situation.

'I have been in contact with the Great Western Ambulance Service and there must be an inquiry into this. This must not happen again. 

'We have had problems with the ambulance service before in this area. It is unacceptable. The family is very upset by what happened.'

Doreen Wignall was taken to Salisbury District Hospital but died two days later

Phil Matthews - who is chairman of the Involvement Network - added: 'I am very concerned about the information forwarded to me about the three hour wait to get to this lady. There should be an inquiry and it must be done very quickly.'

Grandfather John Binsley, 71 - who gave first aid to Doreen - said: 'I revived her after she fell unconscious.

'She fell on the black ice. It had been raining. It was an hour and five minutes before a paramedic turned up. I used my kitchen towels to stem the blood from the wound. The ambulance arrived so much later - probably nearly two hours.'

The Great Western Ambulance Service yesterday refused to comment about the three hour wait

They released a statement that said: 'We have been notified by the coroner about the outcome of this incident on Saturday 17 December and will be co-operating fully and openly with the resulting inquest. We will also be carrying out a thorough internal investigation.'

Mrs Wignall’s daughter Mrs Julie Pickernell did not want to talk about what happened.

An inquest opened at Salisbury yesterday into the death of Mrs Wignall from Ludgershall, Wiltshire.

Deputy Wiltshire Coroner Peter Hatvany was told she died from a Intracranial bleed following a fall at Ludgershall. She was identified by her daughter Julie Pickernell.

Mr Hatvany adjourned the hearing to a date to be fixed.
