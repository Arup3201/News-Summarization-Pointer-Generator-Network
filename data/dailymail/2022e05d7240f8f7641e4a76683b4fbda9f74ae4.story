Anti-capitalism protesters from the Occupy movement have begun a new protest in the City of London.

It is part of a global day of action seeing thousands of people rallying in cities including Moscow, New York, Athens and Madrid, organisers said.

Several hundred people have gathered outside St Paul's Cathedral for a rally before 'visiting the 1%' at the offices of some of the largest firms in the financial heart of the capital.

There were some minor skirmishes between protesters and police as they marched through the City.Officers had briefly encircled the protest after it moved down Fleet Street and into Fetter Lane, causing some protesters to break through the police line.

It comes more than six months after members of campaign group Occupy London were prevented from occupying the square in heart of the City of London.

Instead, activists set up camp outside St Paul's Cathedral just yards away from the Stock Exchange and remained there for four and a half months.

At the start of May police arrested five people after between 50 and 100 anti-capitalist protesters set up a temporary camp outside the London Stock Exchange following May Day demonstrations.

They moved into Paternoster Square with tents and supplies on May 1, but were forced to leave by officers several hours later.

Occupy protesters were joined by members of Spanish protest group Indignados and Take the Square.

An Occupy spokesman said: 'Nowhere in Europe is the unequal distribution of wealth as striking as in the UK.

'The richest 1,000 persons, just 0.005% of the adult population, increased their wealth by £155bn over the last three years.

'That is enough for themselves alone to pay off the entire budget deficit and still leave them with £30bn to spare.

'"We're all in this together" never rang so hollow. Whilst the rest of the country is being crippled by austerity, the very same people who caused the crisis are now sitting on wealth even greater than what they had before the crash?'

City of London Police said it had a 'proportionate' operation in place around the peaceful demonstration. St Paul's Cathedral remains open to tourists.

Occupy protesters have started protests in cities across the world

In February anti-capitalist demonstrators outside St Paul's Cathedral were finally evicted after a court ruled that the human rights of the public outweighed those of the protesters.

The 'Occupy' campers were refused permission by the Court of Appeal to challenge orders forcing them to go.

Three judges, headed by Master of the Rolls Lord Neuberger, rejected arguments the protesters should stay because human rights law protects their right of free expression and to free assembly.

The Occupy camp was set up in October and rapidly transformed itself into a tent city causing chaos on the steps of the cathedral.

Protesters prevent the public using the streets, harm local businesses, have strained the drainage system, abused cathedral staff and created noise and graffiti, the court heard.

As a result, Lord Neuberger, the senior civil law judge, said the human rights of the public and landowners superseded those of the protesters.

He said the decision to end their campaign against corporate greed was 'entirely lawful and justified'.
