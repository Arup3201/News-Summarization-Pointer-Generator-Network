A cocker spaniel puppy was able to go walkies for the first time after becoming the youngest dog in the UK to undergo a full hip replacement.

Captured in mid-flight, Stanley looks like the happiest of puppies running himself ragged on walkies.

But the ten-month-old cocker spaniel is only just getting into his stride after a rare degenerative disease left him unable to stand or walk – until now.

Recovery: Cocker spaniel puppy Stanley has become the youngest dog in the UK known to have undergone a full hip replacement

New lease of life: Stanley had been unable to walk properly or run because a rare disorder was causing its hip joints to slowly disintegrate

At just five months, the cocker 
spaniel became the youngest dog in the UK to have a hip replacement 
operation, earning him the nickname the bionic dog.

Stanley was suffering from Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, thought to be caused by poor blood supply to the ball of the thighbone.

The illness had wasted away his back legs, leaving him in agony.

The risky £6,000 operation, usually 
carried out on dogs twice his age, was paid for by his owners’ 
insurance.

Vets feared that unless he underwent the procedure he would have to be put down because it was in too much agony.

But now since undergoing the operation at just five-and-a-half months 
old, the cocker spaniel is enjoying a new lease of life and is able to 
go for a walk and run properly for the first time in its life.

Stanley is now looking for a new
home after his owners were no longer able to care for him.

Ray Dedicoat, owner of Hollytrees Animal Rescue Trust in Hollywood, Birmingham, where Stanley is staying, said: ‘He’s like a bottle of pop. Considering what he’s gone through it takes some believing.’

'Miserable': Stanley, left, was unable to use its hind legs properly and would drag itself around using its front paws, but now the pooch is racing around at top speed (right) thanks to a hip replacement operation

Stephanie Tickale, of Maypole Veterinary Clinic, Birmingham, said
the risky procedure is normally only performed on fully-grown dogs.

She said: 'He was really miserable, he would whimper a lot, he became 
very very thin and weak on his back legs because he just wasn’t using 
them.

'He would walk or rather drag himself round sometimes, lying with his 
back legs on the floor and just dragging himself on his front legs which
was really sad to see.

'It’s not routinely done in dogs under the age of 10 to 12 months old 
because you normally have to wait for them to finish growing but because
Stanley was in so much pain we decided to take the risk and put him 
through the surgery even though he was a very small pet at the time.'

X-rays: Stanley's hip joints were disintegrating (seen left in an X-ray) leaving the dog in tremendous pain, but the pooch has made a full recovery following a hip replacement (seen right in an X-ray after the operation)

'Livewire': Ray Dedicoat (pictured holding Stanley) from Hollytrees Animal Rescue Trust said staff call the lively cocker spaniel puppy the 'bionic dog'

Mr Dedicoat, owner of Hollytrees Animal Rescue Trust in Hollywood, 
Birmingham, said that due to a change in family circumstances Stanley is
now looking for a new home.

He said: 'Stanley needs space to roam. He is such a livewire now. Whenever he meets you he has just got to climb up you.

'All he wants to do is sit on your shoulders.

'If you’re sat watching TV he’s not happy on the floor or the sofa - he wants to be on your shoulders.

'He spends more time on two legs than on four. He’s one of the maddest dogs we’ve ever had but there’s no malice in him,' Mr Dedicoat said.

'Considering what he’s gone through it takes some believing. We call him the bionic dog.'
