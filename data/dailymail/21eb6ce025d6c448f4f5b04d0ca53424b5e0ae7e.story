The Governor of the Bank of England Sir Mervyn King has suggested that interest rates would not rise until it was certain the economy was growing and there had been a drop in unemployment.

He was giving evidence to MPs at the Treasury Select Committee along with other members of the bank.

Sir Mervyn also indicated yesterday that a large cash injection directly into the economy to boost asset prices and spending was possible.

Reprieved: Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, told MPs yesterday he was against a rise in interest rates

He said: 'We expect to see relatively weak consumer spending. The fall in house prices has come back a bit, activity is very weak.

'But the number of repossessions is way down from what we saw in the early 1990s.

'The reason we would raise interest rates would be in the context of a much stronger economy, with unemployment falling rather than rising.

'It should also be the case that the interest rates that borrowers face should not rise as fast as the rise in Bank rate.'

Divided: Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, raised concerns over freezing interest rates again

Minutes from a meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) earlier this month revealed conflict between members over what plan of action would be best for the struggling economy.

Paul Tucker, the Bank's deputy governor, revealed he is close to voting for a rate rise.

Mr Tucker, who has been tipped to 
succeed Mr King in the top job in 2013, said: 'I'm one of those that is worried 
about an upward drift in inflation expectations.

'The longer that inflation remains so
high, and we say it's due to another one-off factor, the more the 
people of this country think we use this ''one-off factor'' in a 
completely different way.'

Mr Tucker, who has voted for unchanged 
rates so far, said he was concerned slow growth was eroding supply 
capacity, and with it Britain's ability to grow strongly in the future.

Interest rates have been at a record low of 0.5 percent since March 2009, and earlier this year economists had expected a rise.

Any prospect of that now looks likely to be left until next year.

The development comes as official data showed the biggest fall in households' disposable income in more than 30 years.

They showed savings shrank in the first three months of the year as families struggled to keep up with rising prices.

Stagnant wages meant the savings ratio - the money they have left to tuck away after paying bills - fell from 5.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent over the three months to March.

At the same time, households - while paying more - are actually buying fewer goods and services.

Economy watch: GDP or gross domestic product fell 4.6 per cent in the 1980s recession, by 2.5 per cent in the 1990s 
recession and by 6.4 per cent in the so-called Great Recession of 2009

The amount bought 
in those months fell by 0.6 per cent - the largest decline since the 
depths of the recession in the spring of 2009, according to the Office 
of National Statistics.

The ONS revealed the volume of products and services bought has taken its biggest fall since the depths of the Great Recession but the amount spent has risen.

House prices saw a further fall during May after all but the top end of the market experienced weaker activity, the Land Registry said.

The average cost of a home in England and Wales dropped by 0.4 per cent in May, to bring the average cost down to £161,823 - 2.2 per cent lower than a year ago - according to the latest industry data.

Housing activity also slowed sharply, with the number of transactions dropping by 13 per cent to 44,803 in March, the latest figures available, from 51,399 at the same time last year.

The May decline was the seventh month out of the past nine that prices have fallen, with the average price now down by 3 per cent from its peak in August.

London is the one place bucking the trend, with prices rising by 2.9 per cent over the past 12 months, though over the month the East Midlands also saw prices pick up slightly.

The number of properties being sold worth over £1million also surged by 58 per cent from 511 to 805, highlighting the strength of the high end market, a lot of which is based in London.

The weakest areas were in the North East, which saw an annual fall of 6.9 per cent, and Wales, where prices fell 3.5 per cent in May alone.

Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the main support for house prices will come from the fact that interest rates are likely to ‘remain very low for some considerable time to come’.

He added: ‘In fact, it is looking ever more likely that the Bank of England will hold off from raising interest rates until 2012.’

The ONS said the rise was 'driven by price increases, rather than the purchase of more goods and services 
by households' with prices up 1.9 per cent in the first three months of the year.

The amount of goods and services bought 
in those months fell by 0.6 per cent - the largest decline since the 
depths of the recession in the spring of 2009.

The comparison on a year ago was more 
pronounced with volumes bought falling by 0.5 per cent but household 
spending up 5.2 per cent due to rising prices.

It was also confirmed that economic growth is sluggish - meaning there is little hope of wages being increased.

As a whole the economy grew by 0.5 per cent in those months. But this follows a 0.5 per cent fall in the final quarter of 2010.

In response to the gloomy news, Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro in response.

Analysts also
pushed back their forecasts for rises in the UK bank rate.

Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, lowered his 
prediction for the end of 2012 from 2 per cent to 1.5 per cent for the base rate.

'The 
drop in domestic demand was still appreciable and there was still 
marked, worrying declines in consumer spending and business investment,'
he added.

Among the bad news revealed today was:

However, there was some encouraging news.

Trade made the biggest contribution to first quarter GDP growth since 1977 and the economy saw the biggest rise in services output since early 2007.

Exports continued to aid Britain's economic recovery, up to an all-time high of £74.6billion, but they are 
still heavily outweighed by imports.

The most recent figures for the current account deficit  - the 
difference between imports and exports - were also published today and show a narrowing to £9.354 billion from 
£12.956 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010. This was the smallest 
deficit since late 2009 but was still double what economists had 
forecast.

The all-powerful ratings agencies were focused on today's data release. 
Fitch responded by reducing its estimate for growth in the UK economy in
2011 to 1.4 per cent from 1.6 per cent. It maintained its estimate for 
2012 at 1.7 per cent.

It said the decline in consumption and investment served as a 
reminder of how anaemic the recovery is with growth still held back by 
households and banks trying to pay down debts or improve their financial
safety nets.
