It's well accepted that the bars preferred by backpackers offer cheap drinks and the chance to meet like-minded future Facebook friends, but Fremantle Prison YHA is offering up a whole new experience.

Western Australia's only World Heritage-listed building has been transformed into a youth hostel where worldly travellers can spend a night behind bars in the cells previously occupied by hardened criminals.

Bookings open this week ahead of the opening of the hostel following a renovation of the famous institution's Women's Prison which took nine months.

YHA spokeswoman Emily Abbott says the launch of the hostel will be the culmination on five years of planning for a project that almost didn't get off the ground but that it is now ‘one of the most unique accommodation options in the country’. 

The north-western complex of the prison was built in the 1850s and originally served as the cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry but the closure of Perth Gaol meant a place was needed to keep female prisoners.

They were transferred to Fremantle and the wing was secured by an extra wall to keep them in, with varying results. And as Western Australia’s criminals increased with the population, the division was further extended until it was rendered redundant by the building of the specialist Bandyup Women's Prison in 1970.

The entire prison was closed in 1991 and its historic status has since been confirmed and honoured by Unesco, a blessing and a curse as far as the hostel is concerned. 

Inspection time at the cells will take on a whole new meaning when the Fremantle Prison YHA opens soon

Hangings, floggings and some famous escapes once took place in the prison soon to be filled with smiling faces

‘The status as a World Heritage site added many challenges to the development, which was shelved a number of times before finally receiving approval in April 2014,' Abbott says. Building approval was officially given the green light the following month.

The prison itself was built by convicts between 1851 and 1859, and was consequently referred to as the Convict Establishment. 

It remained a prison for 136 years until it closed, with the Women's Prison part of the property used as education facilities by TAFE School of Art and Design from 1993 to 2009.

Reminders of the history of the prison, from past inmates to renowned escapees, are found throughout the halls

The Fremantle Prison's entire complex serves as a popular and award-winning tourist attraction in its own right

Only a small overhaul was needed - and allowed due to the heritage listing's restrictions - to turn the prison into short-term accommodation which Abbott says is 'as prison-like as it is comfortable'.

The walls, floors, windows and bars in some case retain the feeling of a place where you could be locked in with the key thrown away, but additional facilities have also been added to bring the hostel in line with its competitors. 

For those who don't like the idea of being behind bars, the Victorian-style guards’ cottages outside the front gates are a more luxurious option.

The women once locked away in this wing would have usually ‘offended the good order’ of society, with the most common offences including 'vagrancy, loitering in public places, drunkenness, obscenity, soliciting, running a brothel, being idle or having no visible means of support'.
