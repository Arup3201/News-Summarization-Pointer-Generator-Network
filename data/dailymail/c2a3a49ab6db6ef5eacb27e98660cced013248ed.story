Teenage boys should be taught in single-sex classes to protect them from being intimidated by ‘bright and articulate’ girls, an education boss says.

Separate lessons for boys aged 11 to 16 in state schools could stop them falling behind in exam results, according to the first male president of the Girls’ Schools Association.

Statistics have shown that boys often lag behind girls at both GCSE and A-level and are much less likely to apply to university.

Alun Jones, who is also a schools inspector, said: ‘If you have a very bright, very driven, very focused, very articulate lady, which a lot of girls are, that intimidates a boy in the classroom, especially boys of average ability.

‘The result is that boys don’t put their hands up to answer questions or they indulge in immature behaviour to avoid being shown up. Boys are falling behind as girls are doing better.’

Mr Jones told the Sunday Times: ‘Boys will put their hand up if they feel safe; they won’t if they are in fear of being ridiculed or humiliated. Boys fear failure just like girls do.’

The former choral scholar – who has been principal of St Gabriel’s girls’ school in Newbury, Berkshire, since 2001 – is calling for boys to be taught under the ‘diamond model’ to improve their academic results.

The model sees boys and girls educated together until the age of 11, before being taught separately until 16 and then returned to mixed classes in sixth form. ‘In the most formative years when adolescence is hitting with a vengeance, boys should be educated separately.

‘More single-sex classes for boys in state schools might halt the decline in boys’ achievement,’ Mr Jones explained.

‘I think that every state school should consider introducing the diamond model and experiment with teaching boys and girls separately especially in subjects like English, maths and sciences.’

Fears of a gender gap have been fuelled by Department for Education figures released in October, which showed girls striding ahead in GCSE results.

Some 61 per cent of girls in state schools scored at least five C grades last year – including English and maths. However among boys this figure drops to just 51 per cent. The average for both sexes was 56 per cent.

He called on boys to be educated separately from girls in the formative years of adolescence, and suggested more single-sex classes for boys in state schools could improve boys' achievement.

Fears of a gender gap have been fuelled by Department for Education statistics released in October which showed 61.2 per cent of girls at state schools scored at least five C grades including English and maths last year, compared with 50.8 per cent of boys.

But at A-level, boys did better than girls with 12.3 per cent of male students gaining three A*-A grades, compared with 11.1 per cent of female classmates. 

Mr Jones' comments come as its revealed a huge gender divide in the A-levels chosen by sixth-formers is likely to continue as girls continue to shun 'masculine' subjects like physics, it is suggested.

Despite a number of schemes aimed at encouraging young women to take the science after age 16, there has been little impact on take-up so far, headteachers and academics said.
