Tottenham left Belgrade with a solitary point to show for their efforts in the Group C opener against a spirited Partizan side. 

As Mauricio Pochettino made his entry into full European competition the chances were slim for both sides, although Harry Kane went close for the visitors early hitting the crossbar and Hugo Lloris was tested more than his counterpart.

Sportsmail's Dan Ripley was there and rates the Tottenham players' performances below.

Tottenham striker Harry Kane's shot hits the cross bar in one of the best chances to break the deadlock

TOTTENHAM

Hugo Lloris - 6.5

Not the busiest of nights for the French stopper, who was otherwise reliable when called upon between the sticks.

Kyle Naughton - 6.0

Much like Ben Davies, Naughton was limited to providing attacking width from full-back and struggled defensively.

Federico Fazio - 6.5

Misjudged a header in the first half that nearly resulted in Partizan scoring, but helped marshall the defence well.

Jan Vertonghen - 7.0

Made a number of crucial blocks to cover team-mate errors. The Belgian slowly looks like getting back to his best.

Tottenham Hotspur's Jan Vertonghen was a rare encouraging performer for his side

Ben Davies - 5.0

Looked uncertain in possession, and was the target for many Partizan attacks down the right side. An uncomfortable night.

Nabil Bentaleb - 5.0

Anonymous in an attacking sense and was careless in giving the ball away. Never looked like making a major impact.

Benji Stambouli - 6.5

Calm and composed in possession and anchored the midfield well. Replaced by Capoue after picking up second half knock.

Nabil Bentaleb went missing in attack and didn't value possession when given the opportunity

Aaron Lennon - 5.5

Lennon's strongest asset is his pace, but even on the rare occasions he could use it, the winger darted into dead ends.

Paulinho - 5.0

A passenger throughout the game. It was no surprise to see the Brazilian replaced by the attack minded Soldado on the hour.

Andros Townsend - 6.5

Tried to be Tottenham's most creative player. But Spurs never had a shot on target while he was on the pitch. Replaced by Lamela.

Harry Kane - 6.0

Hit the woodwork in the opening moments, but never linked with team-mates in midfield and was easily marked out of the game.

Harry Kane came close hitting the woodwork but was shutdown too easily

SUBSTITUTES

Roberto Soldado 5.0 (for Paulinho 60')

Brought on to help Kane in attack with 30 minutes left but hardly got a sniff of the action or anywhere near the Partizan goal.

Erik Lamela 6.0 (for Townsend 59')

Brought tricks and flicks to Tottenham's attack after coming on, but like Townsend couldn't help the visitors take control.

Etienne Capoue 6.5 (for Stambouli 72')

Disciplined in midfield after replacing Stambouli, and brought a physical presence to help limit Partizan's growing influence.

Striker Roberto Soldado came on with half an hour to go to add spice to Spurs attack and chase a goal
