Savers will be crippled by ‘several more years’ of rock-bottom interest rates in a form of financial torture that has already lasted for five years, experts warned last night.

It was exactly five years ago today that the Bank of England made the emergency move to halve the base rate to 0.5 per cent.

Prudent savers have been robbed of more than £300 billion by the Bank’s decision due to dire interest rates as well as their nest egg’s loss of spending power as the cost of living has risen.

Savers will be crippled by 'several more years' of rock-bottom interest rates in a form of financial torture that has already lasted for five years, experts warned last night

While homeowners have benefited from low mortgage repayments, at the same time there has been a devastating impact on the lives of savers and an erosion of Britain’s savings culture.

The consultancy Capital Economics said it does not expect the Bank to increase the base rate from 0.5 per cent ‘until late next year.’

And even when interest rates do start to rise, the Bank has repeatedly made clear that the increases will be ‘gradual’.

Danny Cox, head of financial planning at Hargreaves Lansdown, the financial advisers, said: ‘Interest rates look set to remain low for longer.

‘Even when rates do begin to rise, savers are likely to face several more years of low returns on their hard-earned cash.’

A family with a £100,000 mortgage is paying around £3,300 a year less on interest payments on their loan, according to Dr Ros Altmann, the former Downing Street adviser.

But savers with a £100,000 nest egg are getting around £4,260 a year less in interest.

The Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, used his first speech as governor last August to express his 'tremendous sympathy' for savers

Overall, she calculates savers are £18,500 worse off since January 2008, the depth of the financial crisis.

Dr Altman said: ‘The message being sent is: ‘You’re a mug to save.’

Simon Rose, from Save our Savers, said: ‘Who could possibly believe that five years on, savers are still being punished?

‘It is foolish in the extreme and it is going to end in tears.’

The Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, used his first speech as governor last August to express his ‘tremendous sympathy’ for savers.

He said they had ‘done the right thing, set money aside and now they are earning returns that are substantially below what they would have expected.’

Save our Saver’s research looked at Britain’s £1.2trillion balance of cash savings, held in everything from savings accounts to tax-free cash Isas.

It compares how much interest they have been paid for their nest eggs, compared to how much they would have got if rates had been kept at their pre-crisis levels in March 2008.

The total amount of ‘lost interest’ over the last five years is £117billion, according to Save our Savers.

But this is not the end of the pain inflicted on savers. In a second blow, their nest eggs have also been hit by the rising cost of living, which has reduced the spending power of their money.

The loss of spending power is £209billion over the last five years, based on a calculation using the retail prices index measure of inflation.

This makes a total ‘loss’ of £326billion. To put this vast number into context, this is around 12 times the total amount of money which people will pay in council tax this year.

Simon Lambert: Savings rates are terrible right now

There is no real way of dressing up savings rates at the moment - they are absolutely awful.

The first week in March should be the height of what the financial industry calls Isa season, the time of the year when savers rush to use their tax-free savings allowance before it runs out at the end of the tax year at the start of April.

This traditionally also means a rush of new savings accounts arriving on the scene, as banks and building societies try to tempt customers away from rivals by nudging up rates.

This year, Isa season is a dud.

We compile our own independent This is Money savings tables. It's safe to say we haven't been overwhelmed with the offers trickling in. The best rate you can find on an instant access savings account is 1.75 per cent from Britannia - and even then you are limited to two withdrawals a year.

The next best easy access account with no limits on withdrawals, which can be opened online is from National Counties Building Society at 1.65 per cent.

You can get better rates for locking in your money, with the highest rate a 3 per cent five-year fix from Skipton. But to get that you have to commit to not getting at your cash until 2019.

To find the best tax-free savings deal, bookmark This is Money's Five of the best Isas round-up, which is updated throughout the year.

Rates like this lead people to question whether it is even worth bothering with an Isa. But the answer to that question is, 'yes, they make it even more important.'

This is because we are taxed on our savings interest at our income tax rate, with 20 per cent taken off by your bank and those who pay higher rate tax having to hand over the rest via their tax return. That tax eats into the rate you get, driving savings rates even lower.

But in an Isa you get all your interest tax-free.

If you could find an instant access savings account matching that best Isa rate of 1.75 per cent, which incidentally you can't, then after 20 per cent tax you would only really be getting 1.4 per cent and after 40 per cent tax you would get 1.05 per cent.

Annual Isa allowances come with a use it, or lose it status. Everyone can save up to £5,760 into an Isa this tax year, which ends on 5 April 2014, it is then gone. They then get a new allowance for 2014 to 2015, of £5,940.

Crucially, however, you can put money into a new Isa and transfer all your existing Isa savings pots into a new better deal if you can find one. That means savers need to do two things. Firstly, make sure new savings go into an Isa and that they make the most of their allowance each year and, secondly, make sure all their existing Isa savings are getting the best rate possible and move them if need be.

When savings rates are this bad it only makes more sense to use an Isa.
