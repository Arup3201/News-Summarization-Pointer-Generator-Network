You can take the man out of Barcelona, but you can never take the Barcelona out of the man.

That phrase is certainly true for Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola who celebrated with the home fans as Ivan Rakitic opened the scoring for Barcelona against Manchester City.

Guardiola quickly stemmed his excitement by covering his face with his scalf as he realised he was celebrating in front of the world's media.

The Catalan side went on to beat Manuel Pellegrini's side 1-0 as they progressed to the last eight of the Champions League.

Guardiola knows all about life at the club having managed there between 2008 and 2012, and their progression now means he could end up facing his former employers in the next round of the Champions League.

Bayern Munich themselves cantered through with ease as they thumped Shakhtar Donetsk 7-0 at the Allianz Arena following a goalless first leg against the Ukranian side.
