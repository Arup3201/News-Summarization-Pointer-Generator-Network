Wanted man: A nationwide manhunt is under way for Harry Mapps, 59, who is suspected of killing three people and setting their Colorado home ablaze last month

A nationwide search is underway for a former long-distance trucker who is suspected of murdering a family of three in Colorado and then setting their home on fire to cover up the crime.

Harry Carl Mapps is wanted on charges of first-degree murder and arson in the November 27 shooting deaths and a blaze at the home where the bodies were found, Pueblo County Sheriff Kirk Taylor said at a news conference in Pueblo.

Mapps, 59, was a friend of one victim and had been staying with him, authorities said.

He said investigators have some ideas about where Mapps might go but declined to provide details.

‘He was an over-the-road truck driver. He's very familiar with some less-traveled roads across the country,’ Taylor said.

Taylor said Mapps should be considered armed and dangerous. He declined to say what kind of weapon he might have.

The bodies of 51-year-old Reginald Tuttle, his wife, 55-year-old Kim Tuttle, and their daughter, 33-year-old Dawn Roderick, were found in the remains of the home outside the small town of Rye.

Roderick lived in nearby Pueblo with her husband and four children and was visiting her parents at the time of the shootings.

No good deed: Police say Mapps, a trucker, was staying with Reginald Tuttle and his wife

Mapps was a friend of Mr Tuttle's and had been working for his trucking company while living with him and his wife, authorities said.

‘He took the mother of my children,’ an inconsolable Mark Roderick, Dawn's husband, told CBS Denver. ‘Kind of disbelief. I had never seen him [Mapps] violent, I’ve never even seen him lose his temper, so I’m kind of in disbelief, but just real surprised.’

Taylor said investigators have received hundreds of tips and followed all of them. He said Mapps' last known location was the town of La Junta in southeastern Colorado, where authorities said he cashed a check made out to one of the victims.

An earlier warrant for Mapps' arrest listed charges of theft, identity theft and forgery, all related to the alleged check theft.

Authorities identified Mapps as a suspect in the deaths three days after the fire, but the murder and arson charges were not announced until Thursday. Taylor said the warrants took time to process.

‘The new charges will make him one of the most sought-after fugitives in the country,’ the sheriff said.

‘Law-enforcement agencies nationwide will not want a triple-homicide suspect on the streets.’

The warrant is sealed and no details have been released.

A federal fugitive arrest warrant has also been issued for Mapps, U.S. Marshal John Kammerzell said.

Mapps was initially described as a handyman. His estranged wife, Sandy Mapps, told The Denver Post she ordered him to leave their home in Dimmitt, Texas, last spring. He quit a farm labor job in Texas and moved to Colorado, she said.

Mrs Mapps has been using her Facebook page to spread the message about her husband’s manhunt, posting regular updates on the progress of the investigation.

Fugitive: Mapps is considered armed and dangerous. He was last seen driving a blue 2004 Chevrolet mini-van with the Texas license plate

A $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to Mapps’ arrest.

The fugitive was last seen driving a blue 2004 Chevrolet mini-van with the Texas license plate 7FSNK. He is described as 6 feet tall, weighing 135lbs, with red hair and blue eyes. He may have a graying beard
