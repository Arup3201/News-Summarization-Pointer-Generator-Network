She shot to fame at the tender age of nine on hit reality TV show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, and it seems Kylie Jenner's early foray into fame is paying off - quite literally.

The youngest Kardashian family member, 17, has been spotted with not one but eight dazzling Cartier bracelets on her wrist.

Spotted by Heat magazine, Kylie has been wearing five gold Love bangles, which cost a cool £4,450 each, and three white gold versions at £4,800 each.

Kylie Jenner was last week unveiled as the ambassador for beauty brand Nip + Fab - and it wasn't just her flawless beauty look and bold red pout garnering the attention; her eight Cartier bracelets tot up to a staggering £36,650 in total

In total, the young model and reality TV star is walking around with £36,650 worth of jewellery on her wrist.

With that amount of money, you could be cruising around in a brand new BMW 1 Series or relaxing on a two-week beach holiday in the Maldives. 

It's hardly surprising that the youngster is rocking some serious arm candy; she's certainly earned it.

Kylie and her sister Kendall reportedly make around £9,800 per episode of the show that shot them to international fame.

The young star also wore her eight favourite bracelets at a beauty event over the weekend 

The starlet, who has 18.9m Instagram followers, was then snapped up as the ambassador for beauty brand Nip + Fab.

Giving her model big sister Kendall a run for her money, Kylie proves she can hold her own in front of the camera in the campaign imagery. 

Speaking to FEMAIL about snapping up the young star, Maria Hatzistefanis, President of Nip + Fab, said: 'I am thrilled to be working with Kylie Jenner; she is cool, edgy and an international beauty icon. 

'Kylie has been a fan of the brand for the last year and it’s great to have her in London to meet fans. It’s an honour to welcome Kylie as a friend and I hope this will be the beginning of a long and exciting relationship.'

Maria and Kylie spent the weekend hosting beauty events and meeting Kylie's fans. 'Kylie has great energy and a genuine passion for beauty,' said Maria of working with the star. 

'She is very professional, works hard and it’s been a pleasure working with her.'

Other forms of income for Kylie come from the clothing brand, Pac Sun, that she has with her sister Kendall, right, as well as their young adult book Rebels: City of Indra

This is the latest in a string of successes for the young star, who recently landed herself a shoot in the highly acclaimed fashion bible Carine Roitfeld's Fashion Book.

When Kanye West, who is married to her older sister Kim, recently debuted his first collection with sports brand Adidas, it was Kylie who he asked to star in his show in New York.

Kylie also recently landed the cover of Fault magazine and looked high fashion as she posed in an Alexander Wang crop top with her hair pulled to the side in a fishtail plait. 

Other forms of income come from her and sister Kendall's clothing brand, Pac Sun, as well as their young adult book Rebels: City of Indra, which is based on two young girls Lex and Livia, who embark on a journey together, but later realise their biggest danger might be each other.

Her sister Kendall, left, might be making a name for herself as a supermodel but Kylie isn't doing too badly herself... and she's clearly cashing in on her success 

Kendall told E! News: 'Kylie and I love the creative challenge and are thrilled to have been given the opportunity to share this story.'

Kylie added: 'We can't wait to share these characters and the world we created with readers everywhere. We are so excited!'.

More experimental than her sisters in Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kylie regularly posts pictures of herself trying out different make-up and hairstyles on her Instagram account so her latest successes could just be the beginning for the star.
