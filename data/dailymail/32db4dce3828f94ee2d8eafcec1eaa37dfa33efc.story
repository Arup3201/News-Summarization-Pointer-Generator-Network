NHS chief executive Simon Stevens (above) has urged employees to lose weight to set an example

NHS staff have been told to cut chips and burgers out of their diet after more than half of workers were found to be overweight.

Chief executive Simon Stevens said employees should set an example and said incentives would be introduced to help the 700,000 workers who are overweight.

He said chips and burgers currently on offer in staff canteens would be ditched in favour of healthier meals and NHS sites across the country would include gyms and become more ‘cycle-friendly’.

Mr Stevens, 47, said weight-loss competitions would also be open to the 1.3 million workers, with pedometers and mugs being put up as prizes.

The move comes as the NHS attempts to save money to fund the £30billion a year it is expected to need by 2020.

The rising obesity epidemic has put a strain not only on the nation’s health but also on the NHS, with overweight people relying more heavily on the national health service.

Mr Stevens said he hoped the move would not only set an example to the public but encourage other major employers to follow suit.

He told The Sun: ‘The fact that as a nation we’ve all been putting on the pounds for several years is bad for our health and bad for the health service.’

‘A lot of the food in hospital canteens, not just for patients, but for staff, is chips and burgers.’

‘I think the NHS has got to take an example in helping our own staff and hopefully other employers will follow suit.’

Several hospitals across the country have already started offering weight-loss incentives to staff, with the rest set to begin imminently.

As well as calling on workers to tackle obesity problems, Mr Stevens also urged parents to keep their children healthy by swapping fizzy drinks and fruit juices during meal times to water or milk.

It is hoped the scheme will go some way in reducing the obesity crisis in the UK, where two thirds of adults are classed as overweight and a quarter are deemed obese.

Those who are overweight are at risk from a host of health problems, including Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and strokes, which places further strain on NHS resources.

Mr Stevens, who has lost three stone in the last three years, took over as NHS chief executive three months ago and has been keen to slash ‘unnecessary costs’.

He has ditched taking a car to work in favour of catching the bus and Tube and opts to travel in standard class on trains when he makes regular visits from his home in South London to NHS England’s headquarters in Leeds. 

Looking to the future, he said that further progress in technology would keep patients out of hospital as people live longer, and he wants greater partnership between the NHS and social services.

He said: 'What's great about the NHS can't excuse what needs to change about the NHS. 

'That is the approach that we have got to take. We've got to support people doing great things, nurses, doctors, the frontline of healthcare. But we've also got to raise our game.'

He also called for thousands more GPs to be trained, and said he wants to give them more power to make decisions about how NHS money is spent.
