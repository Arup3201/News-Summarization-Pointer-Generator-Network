She's the daughter of Hollywood royalty but now Dylan Penn's becoming a star in her own right, as the face of an Italian fashion label.

Stunning Dylan, who bears a close resemblance to her actress mother Robin Wright, is the face of Ermanno Scervino's spring/summer 2015 campaign.

The 23-year-old, whose father is Sean Penn, was cast in the California-inspired ads for her classic 'American beauty' looks, the designer said.

'Dylan is a young, beautiful woman, conscious of her background and close to her family,' said the designer

Ermanno Scervino described Dylan as a 'contemporary beauty' and 'young, glamorous and international'.

As the daughter of reformed bad boy Sean and  the House Of Cards star it's no wonder Dylan possesses arresting looks.

'Dylan is a young, beautiful woman, conscious of her background and close to her family but also very independent and determined to succeed in her own professional career,' said the designer. 

The campaign was shot in Tuscany by renowned Italian photographer Francesco Carrozzini.  

The shoot took place in a private villa on the coast of Tuscany with the Mediterranean sea as a backdrop. 

Yet the interior design of the location was intended to evoke California in the Seventies, a look that's echoed in Dylan's loose blonde waves, smoky eyes and natural make-up. 

Dylan Penn has clearly inherited her mother, Forrest Gump actress, Robin Wright's classic blonde beauty

Dylan may be the daughter of actors but her parents cut her off financially at the age of 18, forcing her to make her own way.

After jobs as a pizza delivery girl, and a freelance screenplay editor, she fell into modelling.

Speaking about growing up in a nothern California town, she told Treats magazine, 'I don't deny that I had a very privileged upbringing but my parents and that town maintained a sense of normalcy that I think many people find hard to achieve and I am so grateful for that.' 

Since finalising their divorce in 2010, Sean Penn, 54, has since been in a relationship with actress and model Charlize Theron. 

Robin, 48, was recently engaged to 3:10 To Yuma actor Ben Foster, 34, but the pair split last month.
