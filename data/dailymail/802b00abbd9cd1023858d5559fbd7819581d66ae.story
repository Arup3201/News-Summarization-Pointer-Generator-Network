A millionaire hotel owner attacked his estranged wife's new lover with his nine-year-old son's cricket bat after discovering the pair of them had starting sleeping together, a court heard.

Nigel Underwood, 45, previously ran the  Grade-II listed Oaklands Hall Hotel in Laceby, Lincolnshire, with wife Sarah, 45.

But a court heard in July this year the businessman took his wife to rehab to treat an addiction to alcohol.

Sarah Underwood's affair prompted her husband (centre) to attack her lover Andrew Wordsworth (right) with a their 9-year-old son's cricket bat.  

There Sarah struck up a relationship with another recovering addict Andrew Wordsworth, 47, at the rehabilitation centre in Barnsley, South Yorks.

Lincoln Crown Court heard on September 11 that Sarah returned to a caravan where she had been staying following her treatment with her new lover.

Underwood was waiting for them at the site in Chapel St Leonards, Lincolnshire, and produced the wooden bat from his car after spotting his love rival.

He then launched at Mr Wordsworth and battered him the weapon causing injuries to his left arm and head.

On Tuesday Underwood - who also runs the Savoy Hotel and Suncastle Entertainment Complex in Skegness, Lincolnshire - admitted assault and possession of an offensive weapon.

He walked free from court after being given a 12-month community order with supervision.

Jilted husband Nigel Underwood said he wants to make amends with his estranged wife Sarah

The entrepreneur was also ordered to pay £250 compensation to Mr Wordsworth, £250 prosecution costs as well as a £60 victim surcharge.

Underwood defended his actions, saying: 'He took my wife off me - I just did what any man would have done.'

The court heard the incident happened after Sarah had collected her new lover following his discharge from the rehab centre.

Andrew Scott, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Wordsworth was a recovering alcoholic. Mrs Underwood was also a recovering alcoholic.

'They met at a treatment centre in Barnsley.

'They started up a relationship and when Mrs Underwood was discharged she said she wanted a separation.

'She moved to a caravan in Chapel St Leonards. The defendant did not take the news very well.

'Mr Wordsworth was struck a glancing blow to the head but managed to protect himself with his arm.'

Underwood later went to Skegness Police Station where he handed himself in and confessed to what he had done.

Nigel Underwood said he did the 'honourable' thing by handing himself in after the attack

Mr Scott added: 'The defendant described his actions as stupid. In interview he said that when his wife came out of rehab she was a different person.

'She said she needed space.

'She was still coming back to their home.

'When she didn't come back that night he went to see where she was.'

Sentencing Underwood, from Skegness, Recorder Ciaran Rankin told him: 'You are an intelligent and successful businessman employing many people.

'It is clear that this happened at an emotionally charged time in your life.'

'Honest, upstanding man': Nigel Underwood said he had strong community support after the attack

Sunil Khanna, defending, said Underwood had no previous convictions and was embarrassed by what he had done.

He added: 'He is a very sensible and honest, upstanding man.'

Speaking after the case Underwood, who has three children with wife Sarah, said he still loved his wife and would take her back.

He added: 'I just want my wife back. We have three children together and I just want her to be better.

'Instead, she is shacked up with a recovering alcoholic. I just did what any man would do. I acted honourably as I could and handed myself in straight away.

'That was the night I found they had started a physical relationship and I wasn't happy about it.

'When I saw him I just had to clock him one.

'He was with my wife, who I have stood by for 15 years while she has battled alcoholism.

'On the night she said she had been worried and I wanted to see she was OK and hadn't hit the Barcadi again.

'I had the cricket bat because it was my son's and I help run the borough district cricket team. He came towards me so I reacted and walloped him.

'I was looking out for her because I still love to bits.

'Everybody has stood by me, I had members of my family and members of the Skegness Round Table, where I am chairman, present at court to support me.

'But I have lost a wife, my children have lost their mother, it is a sorry state of affairs but we all love and care for her still.'
