Engine still running: Jean-Francois Hauteville, 47, was found in his car with a bullet wound to the head

A hunter arrested in connection with the murder of a building contractor in the French Alps was today found dead in his prison cell.

Jean-Francois Cottet-Dumoulin, 54, hanged himself after being implicated in a crime which took place just 50 miles from where three members of a British family died in strangely similar circumstances two years ago.

The victim last week, Jean-Francois Hauteville, 47, suffered close-range bullet wounds to the head as he sat in his Peugeot Boxer van in a wooded area near Neuvecelle, close to Lake Geneva in eastern France.

The engine of Mr Hauteville's car was still running last Wednesday when a passer-by found his body slumped behind the steering wheel - with the driver's window open.

Mr Hauteville was a keen hunter, and French police soon arrested and placed farmer Mr Cottet-Dumoulin under investigation.

They lived in the same Alpine town - Lugrin - and were both hunters said to be in dispute over a number of issues, including some £12,000 which Mr Cottet-Dumoulin had lent Mr Hauteville.

But today Mr Cottet-Dumoulin's body was found hanging in his cell at Aiton Penitentiary, close to Albertville and Chambéry. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances.

It was on September 5, 2012 that Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, and his wife, Iqbal, 47, died alongside her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74.

All suffered bullet wounds to the head as they sat in a BMW estate car, following an attack by a mystery gunman shooting outside, and at close range.

The killer, who has never been found, also murdered a French cyclist called Sylvain Mollier, 45, whose body was found next to the estate car. 

It still had its engine running when the bodies were found by a British cyclist soon after the killings. The Al-Hilli's daughters, Zainab, seven at the time, and Zeena, four, survived the savage attack close to Lake Annecy.

Eric Maillaud, who is leading the probe into the so-called Alp Murders, was also tasked with investigating the Neuvecelle killing, which police are certain was a 'murder'.

While refusing to discuss a possible link between the two, Mr Maillaud said last week: 'It seems that he was killed by a shotgun after a shot at very close range. The van he was driving was stopped in the middle lane, and partially blocking the road. The victim had a face wound.'

Lugrin mayor Jacky Burnet said Mr Hauteville was a 'well-known figure, a dynamic worker who was heavily involved in the local community'. Police said that Mr Hauteville had 'spoken to the attacker' before the shooting, which is believed to have happened overnight on Tuesday to Wednesday.

Mr Hauteville had a 'bullet in the temple,' said a police source. He said he ran a successful business specialising in painting and decorating, and was also a keen hunter. 

In September, Mr Maillaud said whoever was responsible for the 2012 killings may have got away with the 'perfect crime'.

'The further we advance, the less conviction we have,' he said, saying the enquiry 'lacks the element of a witness which allows everything to be opened up. On a number of occasions we thought we were on the right track.'

Mr Maillaud said that 'after two years' hundreds of people had been interviewed, thousands of documents read, and numerous forensic tests carried out 'but there is no priority line of investigation that stands out'.

Conceding that the inquiry could go on for years to come, Mr Maillaud said: 'We have tried everything possible, but we're perhaps we're in the presence of the perfect crime.'

There have been claims that Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, of Chessington, Surrey.

Zaid was last year arrested under suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because of a lack of evidence.

Investigators say that whoever carried out the crime is likely to be a trained marksman, and to know the local area extremely well.

This has led to well-sourced theories that Mr Mollier, the cyclist, may have been the principal target.

He had recently left his wife and two children two live with a multi-millionaire heiress, with whom he had just had a baby, and there were said to be tensions in the relationship. The 2011 killings took place in an isolated layby on a mountain road not far from the tiny village of Chevaline.

A detective involved in the case said: 'The reality is that whoever did it left no forensic evidence, and disappeared without trace. It is sadly quite possible that this will never be solved.'
