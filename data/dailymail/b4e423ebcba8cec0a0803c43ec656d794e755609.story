Nick Clegg refuses to even discuss the idea of tightening laws to prevent knife-wielding thugs avoiding jail

A crackdown to prevent knife-wielding 
thugs escaping jail is being opposed by Nick Clegg and other senior 
Liberal Democrats, extraordinary leaked Cabinet papers reveal.

Despite
 heightened public concern over knife crime following the classroom 
stabbing of teacher Ann Maguire, the Deputy Prime Minister and senior 
colleagues flatly refused to support a tightening of the law in private 
Whitehall talks this week.

In
 one letter to Mr Clegg, sent on Tuesday and marked 'restricted' but 
leaked to the Daily Mail, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny 
Alexander insists jailing more offenders caught with blades would cost 
too much money.

‘It is very 
hard to see how it could be afforded. The Treasury does not support this
 amendment and I am not willing to clear it,’ the Lib Dem minister 
writes.

In another letter to
 the Deputy Prime Minister, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws says 
mandatory minimum sentences are ‘too blunt an instrument’ and he is also
 ‘unwilling’ to support the proposed change in the law.

Justice
 Secretary Chris Grayling has drawn up plans to legislate so that 
offenders caught more than once with a blade are automatically jailed, 
according to senior sources.

The
 review is understood to have been prompted by alarming evidence that 
thugs are escaping jail despite repeatedly flouting the law by carrying 
knives.

Currently, around 
four out of five of those convicted of a knife crime do not go to 
prison. Incredibly, forty per cent of criminals with at least three 
previous convictions are given soft sentences, such as fines, cautions, 
community punishments or suspended jail terms.

In
 a move backed by Home Secretary Theresa May, Education Secretary 
Michael Gove and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, Mr Grayling is 
proposing to use a new Criminal Justice and Courts Bill to make 
sentencing tougher for knife possession.

Conservative
 ministers want the measure put before MPs within weeks, pointing to 
heightened public anxiety over knife crime in the wake of the tragic 
death of 61-year-old Mrs Maguire in her Leeds classroom on Monday.

But
 the documents leaked to the Mail reveal that the proposal has become 
the subject of a fierce argument at the top of the coalition.

One
 well-placed source said Mr Clegg, who chairs the Cabinet home affairs 
committee, declined even to discuss it when it was raised in a meeting 
of the senior ministers on the body on Wednesday.

‘Chris
 Grayling pointed out that they had not talked about this change in the 
law to introduce much more serious penalties for knife crime and this 
was the forum to discuss it,’ said the source.

‘Nick
 Clegg said “we haven’t discussed it and I am not going to have it 
discussed”. He said “I’m in charge of this committee - forget it”. It 
was unbelievable.’

Furious 
Tories say they now plan to vote in favour of the measure despite the 
Lib Dem stance, with a Commons motion expected to be tabled as soon as 
today by backbench MP Nick de Bois.

Rejected: Danny Alexander wrote this letter, leaked to the Mail, telling Nick Clegg the laws would be too costly

In
 a letter dated April 29, sent by Mr Alexander to Mr Clegg ahead of the 
meeting, the Chief Secretary said he had ‘serious concerns’ about 
tightening the law.

‘It 
would impose a substantial new pressure on the prison population as soon
 as it is implemented. The Ministry of Justice’s budget is already under
 significant strain and this proposal would certainly not be affordable 
before 2016/17,’ he wrote.

‘It
 is very hard to see how it could be afforded afterwards given the 
further fiscal consolidation required in the next Parliament.’

Mr
 Alexander acknowledged Mr Grayling’s pledge only to implement the new 
system when it is affordable, but added: ‘My strong view is that we 
should not be seeking to put measures on the statute book if they could 
not realistically be commenced for several years at best.

‘The Treasury does not support this amendment and I am not willing to clear it.’

Schools
 minister Mr Laws, in a letter to Mr Clegg dated April 14, insisted 
judges should be free to give repeat offenders whatever punishment they 
see fit.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (left) said now is the time to discuss a change in the law but Liberal Democrat and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (right) insists tighter restrictions would be too costly

‘The principle of 
judicial discretion is the cornerstone of our sentencing framework and 
mandatory minimum sentences restrict such discretion and can lead to 
unintended or unwelcome outcomes,’ he wrote.

‘I
 have concerns about the impact on the prison population and the 
deliverability of the policy within this Parliament. I am therefore 
unwilling to clear this proposal.’

Another
 coalition source said veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke, who was 
Mr Grayling predecessor as Justice Secretary and was attacked as too 
liberal by MPs on the Right of his party, is understood to be the only 
senior Conservative backing the Lib Dem position.

‘Ken
 doesn’t like any toughening up of the justice system at all,’ said the 
source. It is understood that the tightening in the law so that anyone 
convicted on their second offence – or more – would automatically be 
jailed.

It would mean 
several hundreds more offenders a year facing jail and sent a powerful 
message to criminals that the use of blades will not be tolerated.

Tragic: Hundreds of tributes have been left outside Corpus Christi College for Mrs Maguire after her death, believed to be the first killing in a British classrom, shook the nation

Today Mrs Maguire's family gathered to read the tributes as Conservative leaders were said to be drafting plans to legislate so that offenders caught more than once with a blade are automatically jailed

The
 Tories made toughening the law on knife crime a key manifesto pledge, 
suggesting before the last general election that anyone caught carrying a
 knife should expect to face a prison sentence.

To
 the fury of Right-wing Tories, Mr Clarke abandoned the idea of a 
blanket promise, but the Government has taken a series of steps to 
tighten the law for some offenders.

The
 Government introduced an offence of ‘aggravated knife crime’ for 
over-16s who use a knife to threaten or endanger others in a public 
place, which is supposed to carry a mandatory custodial sentence.

The offence of aggravated knife possession came into force at the end of 2012.

Judges
 must impose a custodial sentence - a minimum six months for an adult or
 a four-month detention and training order for 16 and 17 year olds - 
unless the court considers there are special circumstances which would 
make it unjust to do so.

Despite
 the crackdown, Government figures last year found that even in such 
cases, fewer than half of those found guilty of threatening someone with
 a knife were receiving a jail term. A senior Lib Dem source said: 'This
 policy is under discussion and no decisions have been taken. Different 
members of the Government, of different colour, have expressed concerns 
about its affordability.'
