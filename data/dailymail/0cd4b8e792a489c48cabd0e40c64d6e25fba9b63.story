A 9-year-old boy crashed his grandfather's car into a neighbor's home on Saturday afternoon.

The boy mistakenly stepped on the gas and drove the car into neighbor Kathy Adams' Salt Lake City home, KUTV said.

The names of the boy and his grandfather - who was riding shotgun - have not been publicly released.

Driver: The boy who crashed the Jeep was just 9 years old

'It looks like grandpa, the neighbor across the street, let his 9-year-old hop in a Jeep and back it up,' Lt. Scott White told the affiliate station.

The Jeep was seen halfway through Adams' front window, leaving broken glass, damaged bricks and windows, and a bent gutter.

60-year-old Adams showed KUTV the damage her swollen, bloody foot suffered when a couch hit it during the crash. It was being covered with an ice pack.

'I couldn't get up fast enough,' she told KUTV.

In the wake of the crash, she warned 'Always look out your window!'

The house will remain empty until it's safe to return, KUTV said, and police have said the grandfather will be ticketed for letting his young grandson drive his car.
