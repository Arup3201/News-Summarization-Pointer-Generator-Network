Smokers will no longer be allowed to spark up in the playgrounds of one Paris park after a trial smoking ban was introduced for a year.

The initiative, which is likely to now be extended to other outdoor public spaces, was introduced over the weekend as part of an official campaign cut smoking deaths in France.

Smoking is already technically banned in all inside public places in France, including cafes, restaurants, stations and museums.

Stay away from those kiddies! Paris has banned smoking inside the playgrounds of one of its city parks, a move which is expected to be the first step towards a more widespread ban on smoking in public

But terraces and other places outdoors are not included in the ban, because the chances of smokers harming those sitting around them are considered minuscule.

Now the three playgrounds in the Parc de Montsouris, southern Paris, are off limits to smokers for the next 12 months. Paris deputy mayor Pénélope Komitès said breaches would be punished with a yet to be introduced system of formal warnings and fines.

'For now, we're focussing more on persuading people than on punishing them,' she was quoted as saying by the Daily Telegraph.

After the trial, the city authorities 'will determine whether the measure should be made permanent and extended to other Paris parks,' Ms Komitès said.

The decision to begin the process of banning smoking in the public parks of Paris comes after the mayor of UK capital London, a rival metropolis which competes with Paris in standards wealth, culture and opportunity, called similar proposals 'bossy and nannying'.

Boris Johnson set himself at odds with a health panel he set up after it recommended thousands of acres of London parkland and landmarks including Trafalgar Square should go smoke free.

'This idea in my view, as a libertarian conservative, comes down too much on the side of bossiness and nannying,' said Mr Johnson.

'One feature of life in London is that we are a city that allows people to get on with their lives within the law provided they are not harming anyone else.

'I think smoking is a scourge and it's right to discourage it (but) I am very sceptical at the moment.'

'Bossiness and nannying': London mayor Boris Johnson, left, said he opposed bringing in a similar ban, which was first announced by Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, right, as a way of 'teaching people about cigarette addiction'

Paris's outdoor smoking ban was first announced in July by Anne Hidalgo, the city's Socialist mayor, who said the move would be an experiment aimed at 'teaching people about cigarette addiction'.

Perhaps mindful of the massive opposition that there will be to the move in a country where some 30 per cent of the country still smoke, Ms Hidalgo insisted that her 'experiment' would not be strictly enforced.

'We are not into banning, we are experimenting,' said Ms Hidalgo, who said parks in the unfashionable 14th arrondissement, where Parc de Montsouris is located, would act as 'guinea pigs in this experiment'.

The move follows a new Socialist directive which allows bosses to ban wine in the work place – leading to accusations that the very heart of Gallic culture is under attack.

Traditionally liberal Parisians are renowned the world over for sitting outside smoking and drinking as they discuss the arts and philosophy.

Tobacco-related illnesses are a leading cause of death in France, with an estimated 73,000 deaths annually. Despite massive taxes on cigarette sales, health warnings, and every more stringent bans, the country still has some 16million smokers.
