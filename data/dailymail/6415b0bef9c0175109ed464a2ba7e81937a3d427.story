The Duchess of Cambridge appeared to be through the worst of her antenatal sickness as she attended her third official engagement in as many days tonight.

Kate, 32, who is around 13 weeks pregnant with her second child, glowed with good health at an Autumn Gala Evening dinner and reception at L’Anima Restaurant on behalf of the charity, Action on Addiction.

Wearing a rather daring new black cocktail dress featuring slashed nude panels by Temperley London, with her long hair curled and flowing, she walked along a pink carpet as she entered the award-winning restaurant.

The Duchess of Cambridge attended the Action on Addiction charity gala in east London this evening in a £595 Temperley London dress, which accentuated her growing bump, and a pair of black suede stilettos 

During a pre-dinner reception the Duchess met charity supporters and heard a speech by Action on Addiction Chairman John Lloyd, followed by a performance by comedian Rory Bremner.

She will also stay for dinner at the award-winning Italian restaurant in the City of London.

As soon as Kate arrived at the restaurant she was ushered towards a group of charity supporters including Swedish multi millionaire Hans Rausing.

The 51-year-old was convicted in 2012 of preventing the lawful and decent burial of his wife Eva's body by keeping it in the house for two months after she died from a drug overdose.

His new wife Julia said last night: 'It's wonderful to be here this evening and wonderful to chat to her (the Duchess).'

Kate also spoke to charity supporter Christopher Holder and kept mum about the gender of her new baby.

He said afterwards: 'She's a fabulous woman, she does so much for charity.

'She said she's loving being here.

'I think there was talk of her heels and there was talk about the baby and I think someone asked the question "what is it going to be?" but she didn't answer.'

At 13 weeks on it is thought to be too early for Kate and William to find out the gender of their second child.

The Duchess chose a pair of elegant diamond earrings to style her outfit. Her chestnut hair had been loosely curled for the occasion

It is her third public appearance this week after reportedly retreating to her parents' home to recover from morning sickness 

One guest reportedly asked the Duchess about the sex of her second baby though she politely did not answer 

It is not known if they will do so eventually but they chose not to find out George was a boy before he was born in July last year.

On Tuesday the Duchess joined her husband, Prince William, as they represented the Queen to greet the President of Singapore, who is currently on a State Visit to the UK.

It was the first time that she had been seen in public since news of her pregnancy was officially announced by Kensington Palace at the beginning of September, several weeks earlier than planned.

Details were revealed as the Duchess had begun to suffer from the same chronic pregnancy-related sickness, Hyperemesis Gravidarum, that saw her hospitalised when she was expecting her son, Prince George, now 15 months.

As a result of the condition, which can leave sufferers vomiting up to 30 times a day, she was forced to cancel a string of public visits, including her first solo foreign tour abroad.

Palace official say that while the Duchess hasn’t entirely recovered, she is feeling well enough to take on a limited number of engagements on a ‘case by case basis’.

It is the third time the Duchess has been seen in public since revealing she was suffering with the condition which saw her seeking hospital treatment during her first pregnancy with Prince George 

It is the Duchess's third appearance this week after getting over the worst of her morning sickness 

Kate was forced to cancel a number of engagements as a result of the illness which brought on severe vomiting 

The Duchess of Cambridge wore her hair in loose curls and accessorised with drop earrings and a black, beaded evening bag at the event 

After Tuesday’s engagement with the sovereign, which also included riding with her husband in a state carriage to Buckingham Palace, Kate also attended the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Awards at the Natural History Museum.

The charity she is supporting tonight, Action and Addiction, is the only one in the UK to be working across the fields of research, prevention, treatment, professional education and family support.

It also runs two residential treatment centres, Clouds House in Wiltshire and Hope House, a women only centre, in Clapham, south London. 

The charity also offers programs to help the families of substance misusers including the M- PACT programme - Moving Parents And Children Together - which supports young people living with addicted parents.

The Duchess has a particular interest in providing early support to children living with parental addiction and launched M-PACT Plus in 2013, which is run in partnership with another of the charities she supports, Place2Be.

She has been patron of Action on Addiction since January 2012.

All wrapped up: A small, neat bow on her Temperley dress accentuated Kate's new bump. Guests at the dinner excitedly asked the Duchess about the sex of the baby but she did not reveal anything

Pictured with the charity's Fundraising Director, Tristan Millington-Drake, the Duchess looked elegant in the flattering dress which highlighted her bump with a neat black bow 

At around 10pm the Duchess was seen leaving the event, carrying a small posy of bright pink flowers 

The bright bouquet was in keeping with the event's colour scheme, with a fuchsia carpet rolled out in front of the restaurant. As she entered her car the Duchess held the bouquet protectively in front of her growing bump 

Earlier this week the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made their first public appearance in weeks at a ceremony welcoming the President of Singapore and his wife 

Later that day the Duchess attended an awards ceremony at the Natural History Museum without the Duke of Cambridge 

Dressed in a baby blue Jenny Packham gown, the Duchess's bump was less visible on Tuesday evening
