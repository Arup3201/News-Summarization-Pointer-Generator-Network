Michael Gove slammed the outgoing EU chief for demand 

Michael Gove has taken a vicious sideswipe at outgoing EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso over the demand for Britain to pay more money to Brussels.

He compared the £1.7 billion bill, which Downing Street blames on Mr Barroso, to the way Bill Clinton’s staff sabotaged computers when they left the White House in 2001.

The Chief Whip fiercely criticised the EU Commission President, who steps down in the next few weeks, for failing to mention the issue when he visited Downing Street last week.

‘The timing just as the Commission are leaving is most surprising,’ Mr Gove told The Mail on Sunday.

‘It’s almost as though this Commission decided, as was the case when Clinton’s team left the White House, to deliberately sabotage computer keyboards for the incoming Bush team.’

When George W. Bush took office, his aides found that all the Ws had been removed from computer keyboards and the desk drawers were glued shut, among other ‘pranks’.

David Cameron had a heated clash with Mr Barroso when the financial demand was discussed at an EU summit on Friday.

The former Portuguese Prime Minister said Mr Cameron had ‘misunderstood’ the issue and that the payment, due on December 1, was in line with normal EU rules.

Interrupting Mr Barroso, the Prime Minister said: ‘You have totally failed to understand the consequences of your actions.

‘It is no good you trying to claim this is some kind of public relations misunderstanding. It is not. This is £2 billion of British taxpayers’ money and I am not prepared to accept it.’

Last night, Mr Cameron faced another challenge to his plans to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU as German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to block his cap on immigration from within Europe.

The outgoing European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said David Cameron had 'misunderstood' and that the payments were in line with normal EU rules 

Bill Clinton's staff admitted to pulling 'a few pranks' on employees of George W. Bush before the latter moved into White House offices at the beginning of his term 

Asked if they would ‘Vote for Ukip if I thought they could win the constituency I live in’, 31 per cent of those surveyed said they agreed. 

That figure was made up of 33 per cent of Tory voters, 25 per cent Lib Dem and 18 per cent Labour supporters.

The Opinium / Observer survey put the Tories and Labour neck-and-neck on 33 per cent – a boost for the Tories who are up five points from a fortnight ago. 

But its findings on the popularity of Ukip will be alarming to the main three parties.

She said: ‘Germany will not tamper with the fundamental principles of free movement in the EU’ – but added that she would help Mr Cameron’s efforts to tackle the abuse of benefits by migrants.

The run-ins with the EU came as Mr Cameron was warned his leadership will be in trouble if, as expected, his party loses the Rochester by-election on November 20 to ex-Conservative Mark Reckless, who is now standing for Ukip.

Eurosceptic MPs warned a defeat would provoke a full-scale Conservative crisis. 

Tory MP Andrew Percy said: ‘If we lose Rochester, there will be serious questions about the strategy at the top of the party.’

Defeat could spark a revolt by 100 Tory MPs over the Government’s decision to opt back in to the European Arrest Warrant.

The Government has decided to opt out of more than 130 European criminal justice measures on December 1 – then immediately opt back in to 35 of them which it thinks are beneficial to Britain.

Home Secretary Theresa May warned that failing to rejoin the warrant scheme would force Britain to release more than 500 inmates from jail, including rapists and murderers, and make it harder to force other EU nations to hand over terrorists for trial in Britain.

Mrs May said ditching the arrest warrant would also lead to Britain becoming ‘a honeypot for all of Europe’s criminals on the run from justice’ and added: ‘British criminals would be able to hop on to the Eurostar or fly to Spain, safe in the knowledge we wouldn’t be able to get them back to prosecute them.’
