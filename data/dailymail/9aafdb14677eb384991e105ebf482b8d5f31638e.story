Survivors of the Costa Concordia disaster were stunned to see the ship's captain standing on the shore without even getting his feet wet, a court in Italy has heard.

Captain Francesco Schettino is on trial in Grosseto accused of causing the shipwreck in January 2012, when he smashed into a reef near Giglio Island, with 32 people on board losing their lives.

The case is in the process of being wrapped up with a verdict expected later this week, but Schettino's lawyers have denied that he acted like a 'reckless idiot'.

Captain of the Costa Concordia Francesco Schettino sits in court in Grosseto today where he is on trial accused of causing a shipwreck in January 2012 

In closing arguments, the court heard that as survivors shivered as they staggered on to the shore of Giglio Island, they were startled to see Schettino already safe on land

The captain is charged with multiple manslaughter and injury and abandoning the luxury liner when many of the 4,200 passengers were still on board and desperately trying to save themselves.

In closing arguments prosecutor Alessandro Leopizzi said that as survivors shivered as they staggered on to the shore of Giglio Island, they were startled to see Schettino already safe on land without even getting his feet wet.

However, the cruise company Costa Crociere Spa has put the blame squarely on Schettino who was in court today for the final arguments, saying that he was suffering from a fever.

The court also heard his lawyer Domenico Pepe repeatedly deny that Schettino abandoned his ship, saying he was thrown off as the vessel capsized.

Mr Pepe also challenged prosecution contentions that Schettino should have immediately dropped anchor and ordered all to abandon ship.

Had anchor been lowered, the lawyer claimed the Concordia would have quickly sunk - instead of eventually coming to rest, on its side, on a rocky seabed outside the port - and thousands would have perished.

Mr Pepe added: 'Like a good sailor, he read the wind and went ahead. He was following the mariner's adage that the ship is the best lifeboat.

Schettino's lawyer also told the court in his final arguments that perhaps one reason some of the lifeboats weren't lowered was because not all of them had been tested in an equipment check three months before the collision.

Helicopters plucked many of the survivors to safety after there were no more functioning lifeboats.

The court also heard from lawyers for survivors and for victims' families who insisted that senior executives of Costa Crociere be made to pay hefty damages for so much death and suffering.

Cesare Bulgheroni, a lawyer representing a Greek couple who survived and the estate of a German who died, said: 'Something is missing in this trial of Schettino.

'It is incomplete because, in our view, other responsibilities, beyond his, emerged.'

Mr Bulgheroni explained that an emergency diesel generator didn't work, elevators didn't shut down for safety reasons during the disaster, some crew didn't speak Italian, the ship's working language while others barely spoke English.

Mr Bulgheroni and other lawyers for civil plaintiffs have banded together in a network called 'Justice for the Concordia.'

They contend that Costa Crociere's board of directors should be equally responsible.

Mr Bulgheroni added: 'We didn't have those people in the dock. There was only Schettino.

'People didn't die because the ship hit the rocks, they perished because they weren't helped in the emergency.'

In 2013, a judge in Tuscany fined the company 1 million euros and Costa asked for a plea bargain deal to respond to administration sanctions, which, under Italian law, are given for companies whose employees commit crimes.

Five Costa Crociere employees were allowed to enter plea bargains in exchange for lenient sentences. None of them is serving prison time.

They include the helmsman and the company's land-based crisis coordinator, who, prosecutors said, downplayed the severity of the emergency.

Prosecutors have asked the court to convict Schettino and sentence him to more than 26 years in prison.

Judge Giovanni Puliatti indicated that the trial will last at least another day, with deliberations to follow.
