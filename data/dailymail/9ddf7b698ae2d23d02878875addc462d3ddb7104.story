A cancer patient who was told she had a good chance of making a full 
recovery has now been diagnosed as terminally ill - after waiting ten 
weeks for surgery because of a beds shortage at her local NHS hospital.

When Heather Crisp was diagnosed with bladder cancer last year, doctors were optimistic because  the disease had not spread.

She
 underwent a programme of chemotherapy which ended in early December and
 according to NHS rules, should have been operated on within a month. 
But the surgery was repeatedly delayed because of the lack of an 
available bed at Wexham Park Hospital near Slough.

In
 late February this year, the mother-of-two was finally sent for 
treatment at a private hospital but by then the cancer had spread to her
 pelvic wall making it inoperable.

She
 was later told the cancer was probably terminal. Her family are now 
launching legal action against Wexham Park, which was put in 'special 
measures' in April.

Last
 night, Mrs Crisp, 62, from Burnham in Berkshire, said: 'I truly believe
 that if they had done the operation when they should have, in early 
January, I would not be in this situation. It's now inoperable, and 
they've said there's nothing more they can really do.'

She
 recalled how, after being turned away for her operation the first time,
 her surgeon had told her to stage a sit-down protest if it happened 
again. When she went in a few days later and was told once more that 
there were no beds, she decided to try the tactic. But after walking 
around intensive care, the surgeon told her there was no point.

That
 second delay, on February 9, prompted a referral to a Spire private 
hospital. But it was not until February 21 that she went under  the 
knife.

Mrs
 Crisp's son Scott, 37, a marketing executive, quit his job in Australia
 to become his mother's carer. He said the family had become more and 
more uneasy as the weeks passed.

He said: 'We were asking, "Are these delays normal? Isn't there a risk the cancer will spread?" '

The
 shocking case comes as official figures published yesterday showed 
cancer waiting time targets in England have been missed for  the first 
time in five years.

Andrew
 Winterbottom, founder of the charity Fight Bladder Cancer, said 
treatment delays were happening 'more and more' because of growing 
pressures on the NHS.

He
 said there was 'no justification' for the wait Mrs Crisp endured, 
adding: 'For bladder cancer, it's absolutely essential to have early 
treatment. Any delay can be fatal.'

Wexham Park Hospital has had problems for years.

The
 Care Quality Commission's decision to put the NHS trust that runs it 
into 'special measures' came after a string of revelations by The Mail 
on Sunday, including details  of a leaked report which revealed dozens 
of patients could have died because of sub-standard surgery.

A
 hospital spokesman said: 'We would like to apologise to Mrs Crisp for 
the delay in her treatment. The trust has launched an inquiry.'
