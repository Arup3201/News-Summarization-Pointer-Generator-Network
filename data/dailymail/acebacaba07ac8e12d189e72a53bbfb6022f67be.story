Novelist Jilly Cooper says a fond farewell to husband Leo at his funeral in Bisley, Gloucestershire

Novelist Jilly Cooper has today said a fond farewell to her husband Leo, who passed away following a 12-year battle with Parkinson's Disease.

The 76-year-old author welcomed mourners, friends and family for his funeral in the village of Bisley, Gloucestershire - where the couple had lived since 1982.

Her husband of 52 years Leo Cooper passed away on November 29, aged 79.

The publisher of military books was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2001.

Devoted Jilly - who first met Leo when she was nine years old - refused to put him into care, instead insisting on looking after him at home in Gloucestershire.

The novelist confessed that she continued to write fiction as a means of paying for Leo's medical bills.

Dressed in a blue patterned dress and black knee-high boots, Jilly sought shelter from the bitter December weather in a black suede coat with a fur trim.

Cutting a sombre figure, the How To Stay Married and Riders author, embraced those who joined her and her family to say their goodbyes to Leo.

She watched as pall bearers carried his wicker casket, bearing a huge bouquet of cream lillies, into the quaint village church.

The couple became an item after the breakdown of Leo's first marriage, after meeting years earlier in the late 1940s at a children's party.

Author Jilly recalled in a tribute marking the couple's 40th anniversary and published in the Daily Mail being impressed by Leo after he hurled a 'ruby-red jelly at a tiresome little girl'.

When Jilly was 14 years old, Leo sent her a Valentine covered in ruby-red hearts, writing inside: 'Isn't this awful?'

And it was 10 years later, while the 
novelist was working at the Ideal Home Exhibition, selling candelabra 
that she met him once again, at a dinner party.

She recalled: 'I found him achingly funny, and he had those dark, untamed, gipsy good looks I've always thought attractive.'

The couple met in the late 1940s at a children's party when Jilly was nine. They married in 1961 and later adopted their two children Felix, now 44 and Emily, 41

To win his future wife's attention Leo, a publisher, sent her proof copies of forthcoming novels, instead of lavishing her with chocolates and flowers.

She added: 'Within a few days, I had decided the only ideal home for me was in his arms.

'When he proposed, I ecstatically decided my ship had come home.'

The couple tied the knot on October 7, 1961 at Chelsea Register Office, followed by a blessing, a family lunch and a drinks party in the evening at the Basil Street Hotel in Knightsbridge.

They returned from their Norfolk honeymoon to set up their first home in Kensington with Leo's cat Michael.

Towards the end of the 1960s the Cooper's moved to Fulham and it was their they adopted their two children, Felix, now 44 and a property developer, in 1968.

Three years later they became parents to Emily, now 41, and a make-up artist.

The marriage was famously happy and survived Leo’s affair in the Nineties, which Jilly described as ‘cataclysmic’.

The family moved to Putney Common where they acquired pet dogs before finally ending up in Gloucestershire where they lived out the final years of their marriage.

Their children gave the couple four grandchildren Jago, Lysander, Acer and Scarlett.

In the tribute piece to mark their Ruby wedding anniversary, re-published last week to mark his death, former Mail On Sunday columnist, Jilly wrote: 'What I had wanted to say was that, although on October 7, 1961, I felt my ship had come home, marriage was, in fact, more like a tiny rowing boat with only two oarsmen setting out on a vast uncharted ocean.

'During our marriage we had encountered heavenly sunsets and sunrises and days of blue sky, when Felix, then Emily arrived, when he, then she, sailed through their A-levels, or Leo won prizes for his books. But we had also run into terrible tempests and killer whales, which had almost overturned our boat.

'Felix nearly dying of meningitis, me lurking in the potting shed in Putney for days on end to avoid our creditors, the bank bullying us to sell our home in Gloucestershire.

'Somehow, we’d managed to cling together and row on.

'In all those years, I couldn’t have had a dearer, kinder, more stalwart captain of my ship.

'I remember how, three days after our 40th anniversary party, a little deer wandered out of the sunset across the lawn and, like the finger of God, allowed Leo to stroke her smooth, brown head.

'These foolish things remind me of you.'
