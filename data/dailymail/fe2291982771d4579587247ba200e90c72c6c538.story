A computer programmer and entrepreneur who murdered his wife and buried her in a shallow grave near their home has been ordered to pay their children $60million compensation.

Hans Reiser, 48, whose company Namesys has developed software used across the globe, was jailed in 2008 for the second-degree murder of his Russian wife Nina.

Now a civil jury in a California court has decided he should pay their two children, aged 12 and 11, after they filed a lawsuit for unlawful death.

Lawyers for the Reisers' children, Rory and Niorline, had asked jurors in Alameda County to pay $10million to each and an additional $5million in punitive damages.

However, after deliberating for several hours over two days, the jury went further and decided he should pay $25million to each child, plus $10million damages.

Reiser, whose company developed the journaled computer file systems ReiserFS and Reiser4, is serving 15 years to life for strangling his wife in their Oakland Hills home.

Mrs Reiser was reported missing in September 2006 and her husband was arrested and charged with her murder the following month.

But her body was not discovered until July 2008, when Reiser agreed to lead police to the site in return for being allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder.

Reiser had previously been accused of first-degree murder, which carries a heavier sentence.

Mrs Reiser's remains were found about a half a mile from the couple's home.

Reiser, who represented himself during the civil trial and claimed that he had rightfully killed his wife to protect their children.

He claimed his wife suffered from a range of conditions including Munchausen by proxy syndrome, in which a parent makes up illnesses in their children to gain sympathy from others.

But authorities said there was no evidence that Mrs Rauser had the disorder or had abused her children.

Reiser showed no emotion as the jury's verdict was read out. He had claimed that he was representing himself because he could not afford an attorney.

Arturo Gonzalez, the attorney representing the Reisers' children, told the San Francisco Chronicle: 'I can't tell you how happy we are right now.

'When you fight a case like this for four years and you have jurors come back and do the right thing like this, is just a wonderful thing about our system for justice.'

Jury foreman William Smith, 65, said: 'We wanted to make it reasonable for everyone involved, and so we didn't want to come up with an astronomical amount that would be thrown out and be considered unreasonable.'

He said Reiser had made clear during the trial that he hated his wife, which garnered little sympathy from jurors.

He said women on the panel 'quite frankly were like, "Screw you"'.

The foreman added that the Reisers' children were 'horribly damaged by this' and the jury wanted to make 'darn sure' they were well cared for.

The children live in Russia with their maternal grandmother.
