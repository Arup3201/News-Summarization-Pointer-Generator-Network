It's a battle almost every parent dreads - trying to get a screaming baby to eat dinner.

But one father has discovered the secret to getting his fussy 10-month-old son Benjamin to finish his food.

Andrew Tsai, from North London, plays him hit Korean music video Gangnam Style which he has discovered has a calming effect on his son.

A You Tube video, which has become an internet sensation, shows clearly the impact the South Korean rapper Psy’s song has on his son. 

As the music plays, Benjamin immediately becomes anesthetized.

His jaw drops for his father to feed him as much food as he can during the short window. Yet as soon as the music stops, the child becomes angry and in no mood to eat.

But replaying the music instantly has the same effect, and dinner time is resumed.
