A 15-year-old boy who committed suicide after he was targeted by bullies, was set to leave town with his parents in a bid to escape his tormentors.

Todd Loik took his own life after enduring a constant stream of abuse from other kids both at his school and online, his heartbroken mom Kim Loik, said.

She told how her son had become a victim
of cruel taunts ever since they moved to North Battleford in 
Saskatchewan, Canada five years ago.

Tragic: Tributes have poured in for the teenager who killed himself just 12 days before his 16th birthday

The situation had become so bad that single mother had decided to take herself and Todd back to their home town of Edmonton, Alberta, later this year.

But before they fled the bullies, tragedy struck on the morning of September 9 when Kim found her son dead in his room after he had taken his own life.

Bullied: Todd was targeted at home and in school

Speaking to the Canadian Press Kim told how Todd had received online taunts the night before he died, she said: 'I told him to go to bed and not worry about it.'

Todd would not allow his mother to see the contents of his Facebok messages, but having now investigated the types of messages her son had been bombarded with, she said they were 'disgusting'.

She continued: 'They have pages and pages of taunts and abuse.

'They were the nastiest things I've ever heard. I can't even repeat — some of the things were just disgusting.'

Speaking of her son's character, she said she was unsure why  Todd was the subject of such torment, saying he was 'just a normal kid who wanted to fit in'.

According to his mother, the teenager wanted to become a welder and was excited about taking his driver's test on his 16th birthday which was 12 days after his death.

He had even showed his mom pictures of his favourite car he hoped to drive someday, a classic Buick Skylark.

Kim said the bullying started in the schoolyard but as her son got older, the insults came through his computer and phone.

'It was usually at night when it would happen. There was no peace.', she said.

Todd was was a week into Grade 10 at North Battleford Comprehensive High School when he died.

Shannon Lessard, a spokeswoman with the Living Sky School Division, said the school were not aware of the bullying as nobody had reported it.

Kim Loik said she now wants justice, which includes a criminal charge against the bullies who tormented her child.

She also wants laws across Canada which will protect the victims of bullying and their families.

She said: 'It can't be province-to-province. It has to be one law preventing this from ever happening again to anybody.

'There's so many kids out there in pain and suffering that deal with this daily and they shouldn't.'

Kim has since set up a Facebok page in memory of Todd called 'Todd's safe haven'.

Among the well wishing posts are some calling for a change in the way bullying his tackled in schools.

One, from Leona Sterling, says: 'Hearts hurting for you and your family today.

'We have to do things differently. We must teach our children the value of every human. Todd's eyes are soft and gentle looking. May you find comfort in the gift he was to you.'

Another posted: 'Heartfelt condolences to your family. Sending you light, love and strength. You are in my thoughts...may you be at peace now young angel.'

Federal Justice Minister Peter MacKay tweeted about the incident, saying: 'More proof that cyberbullying must be addressed. #BullyingHurts'.

Federal NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair also talked about the boy's death on Twitter, saying: 'Let's all work together to fight bullying and put an end to these tragedies.'

Earlier this week, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall sent Loik an email offering his condolences.

He told reporters Wednesday that the province is looking at anti-bullying initiatives, including an online forum where youngsters can report abuse.
