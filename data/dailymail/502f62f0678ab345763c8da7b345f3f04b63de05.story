A mother whose home was allegedly torched when her jilted lover set himself ablaze in the house has died in hospital after two months in a coma. 

Tracy Jones, 40, had been receiving treatment since late September following the blaze at the house in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, which killed her 15-year-old son Shaun.

She had been induced into a coma because of the severity of her burns but died in Whiston Hospital.

Her ex-partner, David Potts, 39, also suffered serious burns and died a short time after the fire was started in the early hours of September 19.

Mr Potts had reportedly set himself alight at her house.

Ms Jones's other children, who were in the house at the time, continue to receive treatment for their injuries.

Daughter Cailin, 18, awoke from her 
coma but remains in hospital where police said she is making a 'gradual 
recovery', while son, Zachary, four, has been discharged but continues 
to receive daily medical aid.

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman 
said: 'A joint investigation between police and Greater Manchester Fire 
and Rescue Service continues.'

Police had previously confirmed there 
had been contact between them and Ms Jones, believed to be over unwanted
attention from Mr Potts, in the month before the fire.

The police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), is investigating how officers dealt with that contact.

Tragic: Shaun Van Straaten was 15 when he died in the days after the attack

Potts, 39, was taken to hospital suffering from severe burns following the attack but died a short time after the blaze.

Potts had reportedly gone to the house in Barlow Road in Broadheath, Altrincham and set himself alight.

Local reports suggested that Potts had split up with Ms Jones and had attempted to get back with her but was rebuffed.

The
39-year-old apparently left a Facebook message for Miss Jones prior to 
the attack, saying: ‘I used to be happy but now I am sad. I used to 
laugh, now I cry.

‘I used 
to be someone, now I am no one’, he added just four hours before going 
to her home, where they allegedly had an argument.'

After the row, he is said to have poured petrol over his body and screamed: ‘If I can’t have you, no one will’, and lit a match.

The
former couple are said to have had a one-year on-off relationship, 
which began when his teenage son Nathan started dating Cailin.

Potts and Jones’s relationship was apparently ‘stormy’ and police had reportedly been called to the house on several occasions.

Potts
is also said to have fallen out with Shaun last October and wrote him a
message saying: 'Please read this before telling me to f*** off… I am 
sorry for what happened.’

He then wrote on Facebook afterwards: ‘Why is life so hard – you can’t live with them but you can’t live without them.’

After
getting back together briefly, Potts and Jones split again in August 
and he posted on Facebook one month ago: ‘My life is s***. Lost my 
girlfriend and her kids.’

Injuries: Two of Tracy Jones's children Zach, four, and Cailin. Cailin, 18, tried to put out the fire as it ripped through their home

He added the following day: ‘Anyone with me to get my life back. Had it taken away, going to fight for it.’

Tracy and Cailin tried to put out the
fire but the blaze ripped through the ground floor of the family’s 
£120,000 semi-detached house.

Firefighters stormed inside the property and carried out Shaun and Zach, who had been asleep in bed.

Neighbours managed to pull Tracy, a typist, from the house after college student Cailin staggered outside and cried for help.

Investigation: Fire, police and forensic officers search for clues following the blaze
