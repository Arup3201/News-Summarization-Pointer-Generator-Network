'Gypsy Sisters' star JoAnn Wells has been busted for allegedly stealing $14,700 from a North Carolina Target in an elaborate coupon scam.

TMZ reported the 29-year-old allegedly teamed up with two cashiers who ran 
fake bar codes on merchandise, forced expired coupons and cashed gift 
cards over 10 days in December 2013.

The reality TV star allegedly told the cashiers at the Cary store she would share the profits.

'Gypsy Sisters' is a reality TV show on TLC which follows the lives of Romanichal gypsy women in West Virginia, and is a spin-off of the popular program 'My Big Fat American Gypsy Wedding'.

Arrested: JoAnn Wells, one of the stars of TLC reality show 'Gypsy Sisters', is accused of stealing $14,700 from a North Carolina Target

Charged: JoAnn Wells, 29 (pictured left and right) allegedly befriended two cashiers at a North Carolina Target who ran fake bar codes on merchandise for her

TMZ reported that Cary Police Department issued a warrant for her arrest, but Wells turned herself in last 
week.

The mother-of-two was charged with obtaining property under false pretense and 
felony conspiracy. The cashiers were also arrested.

Wells, who describes herself as a 'Gypsy Princess', has fired off a lengthy defense on her Facebook page, insisting she used legitimate coupons and that she turned herself into cops voluntarily because she had nothing to hide.

'I had managers check and accept my 
coupons not my problem they accepted them I used an app called Shop Kick
 and target mobile app! (sic),' Wells wrote.

'Second off I don't need to be told not to worry 
about anyone I'm only concerned with MY KIDS AND ME and don't care what 
the rest of the world is saying or doing.'

Mother: JoAnn Wells' mother is Lottie Mae Stanley (pictured) who last year completed a nine-year prison sentence after being convicted of bank fraud

TMZ reported that TLC did not provide comment.

According to her profile on the Gypsy Sisters website, 'JoAnn may be quiet, but she's anything but meek!

'A die-hard romantic, JoAnn is looking for love but willing to press pause on her relationship if it means bringing peace to her feuding gypsy family.'

She appears on the program alongside her sisters Mellie and Nettie Stanley.

The sisters' mother is 61-year-old Lottie Mae Stanley who, according to Starcasm.net, last year completed a nine-year prison sentence after being convicted of bank fraud in 2004.

The conviction came after a string of cons across at least 10 states, with an arrest record including charges of forgery, theft by deception and passing bad checks.

Police also said she used some of her 12 children to help in alleged criminal activity.

'She is one of the smoothest talkers you will ever run into,' Detective Vince Chalecki, the officer from Sugarcreek Township Police in Ohio who investigated Stanley, told The Enquirer in 2003.
