Jeremy Clarkson has reacted with fury after internet trolls joked about the death of his beloved dog.

The Top Gear presenter declared: ‘Britain is a nation of 62million complete and utter b*****ds.’

Father-of-three Clarkson, 52, placed the news on Twitter after one of the family pets, a labrador named Whoopi, had to be put down at the age of 15.

If he expected to receive sympathy from his 503,861 followers, however, he was sorely disappointed.

Grieving: Jeremy Clarkson named and shamed people who sent him vile messages when he revealed that his beloved dog Whoopi, right, a black Labrador, had died last month

He wrote in this month’s Top Gear 
magazine: ‘A few moments ago my dog died, and, as an experiment, I 
announced the fact on Twitter. Now, everyone must have known that when a
family pet is put down, the family in question is bound to be upset. So
you’d expect a bit of sympathy. And, in America, that’s what you’d get.
Not in Britain, though.

‘Moments after I posted my Tweet, a 
man called Ryan Paisey asked, “How does she smell?” Adam Farrow said the
news was “kinda funny”. Phil May wanted to know if it was James May’s 
fault, and Tom Green said simply: “Good”. All that in less than what 
Twitter calls zero seconds.

‘Five minutes has now elapsed, and 
still it’s a non-stop tirade of abuse. Which confirms my theory. Britain
is a nation of 62million complete and utter b*****ds.’

Online: Clarkson did have some sympathetic responses to his news, above, but has named and shamed the Twitter 'abusers'. He posted the Tweet on July 17 and it was retweeted 477 times

Clarkson and his family had owned the 
dog since she was a puppy and named her after the Oscar-winning actress 
Whoopi Goldberg. They have three other dogs, including a labradoodle, at
their home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire.

A source said: ‘Jeremy, his
wife Francie and the kids are all upset. Whoopi was part of the family –
but she lived to a ripe old age.’

Under
the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly 
offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient 
can lead to prosecution.

The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500.

Since
the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet,
e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of 
different laws to charge Twitter trolls.

Student
Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after 
footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and 
Disorder Act.

Two men 
jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the 
Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster 
airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003.

In December last year, Clarkson 
provoked the wrath of trade unions when he said striking public-sector 
workers should be ‘shot’ in front of their families.

He recently criticised a Twitter troll
who posted offensive remarks about Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington.

He said: ‘If I say something that offends you, either here or on the 
television, you know where I am. You can find me. You can shove a pie 
into my face or throw manure over my garden wall . . . but the person 
who ignores Adlington’s remarkable achievements in the pool and 
concentrates only on her nose? She has no idea who they are or where 
they live. This has to stop.’

While the reaction's to Clarkson's tweets don't necessarily go as far as trolling, people who dish out abuse online have come increasingly under the spotlight lately.

Most recently Take That singer Gary Barlow was subjected to taunts from trolls just days after him and his wife Dawn announced that their baby daughter was delivered stillborn.

Olympic diver Tom Daley also received a malicious tweet after his failure to win a medal in the 10m synchronised diving event at London 2012.

A 17-year-old boy was arrested after a message from user Rileyy69 said: 'You let your dad down i hope you know that.'

Daley responded by tweeting: 'After giving it my all... you get idiots sending me this...'

Daley’s father Rob died last year from brain cancer.
