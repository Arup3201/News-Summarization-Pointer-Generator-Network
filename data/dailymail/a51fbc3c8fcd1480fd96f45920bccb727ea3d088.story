This is the heart-stopping moment a paddle-boarder was forced to race frantically back to shore after an enormous whale and her calf began following her in the ocean.

The unknown woman was paddling at Hout Beach in Cape Town, South Africa, when the majestic creatures emerged behind her.

The curious woman began to paddle towards the whales to get a closer look. But the protective mother suddenly plunged underwater and re-appeared just metres away from the woman's board, with the calf in tow.

This is the heart-stopping moment that a paddle boarder was forced to race back to shore after an enormous whale and her calf surfaced in the ocean behind her

The unknown woman was paddling at Hout Beach in Cape Town, South Africa, and started moving closer to get a better look 

But the pair suddenly dove under the surfer and emerged next to her board, forcing her to paddle frantically back to shore 

The giant mammals then followed the terrified woman for nearly ten minutes, until they were in touching distance of her board.

Luckily, the whales abruptly decided to turn around and head back out to sea, leaving the woman shaken but unharmed. 

John Gerrets, a 53-year-old warrant officer in the Dutch army, watched the drama unfold and said it could have been particularly dangerous because of the mother's protective nature over her calf.

He said: 'The woman was on her board when she saw the whale in the distance. She went further away from the beach in the direction where she saw the whale and its calf.

'All of a sudden, the whale and her calf went under and emerged very close to the lady. The whale kept on coming closer and closer.

'I was afraid that she was about to attack her because there was a calf by her side.'

He added: 'The whales were following the paddle boarder for five to ten minutes.

'She could have killed the paddler with her body or tail. It was very scary to see.'
