By Premier League clubs alone £500million has been spent this summer, but throughout Europe there are still numerous transfer sagas rumbling on. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at some of the biggest transfers yet to happen.

MARCO REUS

Club: Borussia Dortmund

Value: £30m

Clubs chasing: Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Real Madrid

Dortmund have already lost Robert Lewandowski and don't want to lose more stars this window. Reus has a clause that kicks in for £20m next year and that is when business is more likely.

Forward thinking: Louis van Gaal is still on the hunt for new recruits, could Marco Reus be heading to England?

ARTURO VIDAL

Club: Juventus 

Value: £32m

Clubs chasing: Manchester United, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain

United know they could do a deal but have not made a move. Vidal's knee, price, and the fact United have other targets means he could be left at Juventus for another year.

Saga: Arturo Vidal's proposed transfer to Manchester United has been going on all summer 

EDINSON CAVANI

Club: Paris Saint-Germain 

Value: £52m

Clubs chasing: Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea

PSG say there is no deal to be done. Cavani wanted out in January and his representatives held talks with United while also pushing to Chelsea. Liverpool have asked but been told not for sale.

Unsettled: Cavani has struggled to settle at PSG, whose attack is dominated by Zlatan Ibrahimovic

RADAMEL FALCAO

Club: Monaco

Value: £50m

Clubs chasing: Real Madrid, Liverpool, Juventus

Real Madrid remain the clear favourites but need to sell a non-EU player to bring in the Colombia star. Liverpool are keen on a loan also with a £10m fee the asking price but he would prefer Spain.

Wanted: Liverpool are desperate to land the Colombia striker but he may prefer a move to Real Madrid

SAMI KHEDIRA

Club: Real Madrid 

Value: £10m

Clubs chasing: Chelsea, Arsenal, Bayern Munich, AC Milan

His representatives spoke with club intermediaries at the start of this week as they see what the market for him is. Chelsea are keen to take him as a free next summer but Real would rather sell now.

Wanted man: The World Cup winner has been on Arsenal's radar all summer but wages could be an issue

ANGEL DI MARIA

Club: Real Madrid 

Value: £50m

Clubs chasing: Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco

At this stage PSG are the only club actively bidding for the Argentine. Carlo Ancelotti wants him to stay but Madrid need an non-EU player out and know his price will help balance the books for FFP.

Form: Angel Di Maria played a huge part in Real Madrid's European success last year
