Business Secretary Vince Cable said small companies are being starved of cash by lenders bailed out by British taxpayers

Efforts to force banks to increase lending to struggling small firms have failed, Vince Cable admitted yesterday.

In an astonishing attack on one of George Osborne’s flagship policies to boost the economy, the Business Secretary claimed the ‘route of using big institutions didn’t work’ and said there was still a ‘lot of frustration with the big banks’.

Singling out state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland, he said that five years after the financial crisis small companies are still being starved of cash by lenders which were bailed out by British taxpayers.

‘The restriction on credit that followed the financial crisis is a problem that has persisted to this day,’ he said. ‘Five years after the crisis, we still have more money being taken out [of small business lending], by Royal Bank of Scotland in particular, than being put in by Lloyds, Santander and some of the new challenger banks.’

Mr Cable’s comments came at an event to promote the Government-backed British Business Bank, which provides state support for ‘challenger banks’ and other alternatives to the main High Street lenders.

The damning verdict on the Government’s efforts to provide a lifeline to small firms represents a direct challenge to the Chancellor, who launched the Funding for Lending scheme in August 2012 and has consistently hailed it as a success.

It was designed to boost the economy by halting a downward spiral of lending and borrowing since the onset of the financial crisis.

Under the scheme, the Bank of England has provided lenders with billions of pounds in cheap funds on condition that they increase lending.

But while the banks have benefited from a glut of cheap cash, net lending to small and medium-sized firms continues to fall. Net lending is the amount lent minus repayments.

Latest figures from the Bank of England also show net lending under the Funding for Lending Scheme slumped by £1.2billion in the first half of the year. This has been driven by a £1.1billion fall at RBS, which received a £46billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008.

Mr Cable said many small firms have become so exasperated they have ‘walked away from the banks’ because they were ‘given a bad deal’.

He continued: ‘Ever since I got into government I’ve been having conversations with George Osborne about how we get small business lending going.

'Our initial instincts were, we have these big banks who have been rescued by the state, why on earth don’t they do it? For a variety of reasons, it never happened.’

Mr Cable said: ‘There is a lot of frustration with the big banks which have failed to prioritise lending to SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises].’

Banks face an inquiry from the Competition and Markets Authority into their failure to lend.

This marked a major victory for the Daily Mail’s Make the Banks Lend campaign launched in July 2010 to highlight the plight of small firms, which need money to grow.

Last night the Treasury hit back, describing Funding for Lending as ‘hugely successful at improving credit conditions for businesses’. It added: ‘The biggest risk to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that’s providing economic security for hard-working people.’

An RBS spokesman said: ‘RBS is the biggest lender for UK SMEs. We are on target to boost new lending by at least 10 per cent to over £9billion this year, and we continue to support thousands more businesses with their expansion plans, having contacted 290,000 SME customers offering over £11.5billion in additional funding.’
