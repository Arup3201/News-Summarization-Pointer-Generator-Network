New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has dramatically dropped in size after having weight loss surgery last year.

At a recent town hall Christie told a constituent he is 'much smaller now than he used to be' but did not give a clear indication of how much weight he had lost.

Experts told Politico this week that Christie appears to have lost a stunning 86 pounds and counting since he secretly had Lap-Band surgery in February of last year, bringing his weight to roughly 236 pounds, down from an estimated 322 pounds.

Experts estimate that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, pictured here last Wednesday, has lost more than 85 pounds over the last year

Christie, 51, is a presumed 2016 Republican presidential candidate.

A former White House physician told CNN last year in February that she thought Christie was literally unfit for the position.

'I’m worried about this man dying in office,' Dr. Connie Mariano said.. 'It’s almost like a time bomb waiting to happen unless he addresses those issues before running for office.'

Christie attacked her after the remarks as 'another hack that just wants five minutes on TV.'

'I find it fascinating that a doctor in Arizona who has never met me, never examined me, never reviewed my medical history or records, knows nothing about my family history, could make a diagnosis from 2,400 miles away,' Christie said.

'You don’t have to be a doctor to look at him and see that he has a problem with weight,' she shot back.

The next week Christie got the Lap-Band surgery, a secret he kept out of the press for nearly two months.

Christie said he had the elective surgery to restrict his food intake because he wanted to get healthy for his family's sake.

'It has nothing to do the performance of my job,' he told People magazine afterward, echoing comments he made a few months prior in an interview with Barbara Walters.

'I think people have watched me for a number of weeks during Hurricane Sandy doing 18-hour days, and getting right back up the next day and still being just as effective in the job, so I don’t really think that would be a problem,' Christie said.

Politicos have speculated his potential presidential plans had something to do with the decision as well, a claim Christie also denies.

'My decisions about anything to do with my career are based upon what I think is best for me and best for my family,' he said when his surgery finally became public. 'Whatever size I happen to be when I have to make a decision about what to do next in my career, I doubt that'll play any role or effect in what I decide to do.'

Regardless of the motivation for his surgery, Christie's frame has noticeably shrunk throughout the last year and a half - something a constituent pointed out last week at one of the Governor's town halls.

'By the way, you do look fantastic,' a female constituent told him.

'God bless you,' Christie told her.

The Republican Governor noted that he's lost so much weight, his wife thinks he should buy new suits.

'But I’m on a budget. I gotta be careful, you know?' Christie told the woman.

An adviser to Christie told ABC two months after the surgery that the New Jersey Governor had already lost 30 pounds.

An expert who spoke to NBC
 in February believes Christie weighed more than 400 pounds before the surgery and 
has lost 90 to 100 pounds. That puts his current weight at 320 pounds, 
give or take, the expert said.

Even at his current weight, whatever it may be, Christie is still considered obese based on his body fat level.

The experts who spoke with Politico estimated that his Body Mass Index is 33. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a healthy level of body fat is 18.5 - 24.9. Anything above that is considered overweight or obese.

Dr. Jessica Barfield, a doctor who specializes in weight management at Loyola Center for Metabolic Surgery 
and Bariatric Care, told Politico that Christie is dropping weight at a healthy rate, however.

'I think he is making progress, 
absolutely, for what I would expect this at this point of the process,' 
she said.

Christie also seems to be taking his weight loss progress in stride.

'Rome wasn't unbuilt in a day,' Christie said of his physique in February.
