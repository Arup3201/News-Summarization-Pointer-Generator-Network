After a long battle with Sriracha manufacturer Hung Fuy Foods, officials from the city of Irwindale have rescinded their declaration that the factory is a public nuisance after a visit to the factory on Tuesday.

Once Irwindale residents began complaining that the air around the factory was 'too spicy' and that they were suffering from health issues, CEO David Tran was told to move his $40 million 655,000-square-foot corporate headquarters and it was declared a 'public nuisance.'

City Manager John Davidson, Mayor Mark Breceda and Councilman Julian Miranda toured the factory and announced today that the factory was 'extremely clean' and 'beautiful.'

The Irwindale City Council voted Wednesday  night to drop a public nuisance declaration and lawsuit against Huy Fong Foods after a visit to the factory (pictured) on Tuesday

'We’re looking forward to being partners for a long, long time,' Breceda told the LA Times.

'We’re almost sorry that this has gone on so long,' he added.

The battle was a hot topic among politicians from places like Texas who invited Tran to move his factory there with open arms.

Tran repeatedly asked officials to visit the factory. Once he put a statement in writing and offered to fix the problems that the council saw and included an outline for specific measures, Irwindale politicians began to take notice.

'We just needed it in writing,' Breceda said.

The factory will grind their peppers again at the end of July and while their air filtration process hasn't changed much, Tran invited a team of people to visit the factory for evaluation once pepper grinding begins.

Tran previously said the legal battle over the factory he calls his 'loved one' reminds him of living in Vietnam, from which he escaped 35 years ago.

'Today, I feel almost the same. Even now, we live in [the] USA, and my feeling, the government, not a big difference,' he said of his long fight with Iwrindale officials a few weeks ago.

A Sriracha shortage in January following food safety regulations in the state of California caused a growing demand for the product and competitors decided to swoop in once the company was at an all time low.

Other manufacturers like Tabasco have begun testing their own version of the chili sauce and the product is available online at their 'Country Store.'

Trader Joe's also has their own version of the popular chili paste.

David Tran patented the look of his product characterized by a clear bottle and a green top however, he couldn't trademark the name because it's derived from a city in Thailand.

Even as competitors attempt their own version of the hot sauce, the original brand is here to stay.
