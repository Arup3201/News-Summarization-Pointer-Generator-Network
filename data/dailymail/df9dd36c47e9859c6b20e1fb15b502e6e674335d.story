Many men have been known to experience a nauseating sinking feeling the moment they utter those two life-changing words - 'I do'.

For Peter Bolton, it wasn't cold feet that left him feeling queasy -  but the prospect of falling hundreds of metres to his death after he lost his balance during the cliff-top ceremony in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Strictly speaking, he was not getting married but renewing his vows with wife, Faith, when the seemingly terrifying incident happened.

Solid footing:  Couple look steady as Peter Bolton reads his vows to his wife, Faith, in Sante Fe, New Mexico

A select few friends looked on in horror as Mr Bolton suddenly leant backwards, appearing to lose his balance as he stood on the edge of the precipice while reading his vows.

He shouts and fearfully flails his arms in the air as guests look on and display very little reaction. 

Luckily, Mrs Bolton was on hand to grab her husband and prevent the happy occasion from turning into a tragedy. 

She manages to get a solid grip on his left arm before pulling him to safety.

While the photos and video have proved a hit online, many are questioning whether the slip really was a close call - or in fact a choreographed stunt.

Either way, the couple, who married in 2009, were able to laugh about the footage at the party that followed the mountain ceremony.
