Staff at a Baltimore TV station found themselves frighteningly close to the news today after a mentally disturbed man who claimed he was God smashed a truck through the front doors of their headquarters and barricaded himself inside for five hours.

The 29-year-old man arrived at WMAR-TV in Towson, Maryland, shortly before noon and demanded to be let inside. When a secretary refused to open the doors, he pounded on the front entrance and screamed 'let me in!'

'Let me in! Let me in! I'm God, I'm f***ing God!' a witness recounted to WBAL-TV.

The man returned moments later - this time with a landscaping truck he had stolen- careering up the sidewalk and front steps of the TV station and ramming the doors several times before finally smashing through driving inside.

Police say that after locking himself in a second-floor editing room in the building, he turned on a TV and watched the commotion he had just caused unfold live on local and national broadcasts.Â 

Just before 5pm, Baltimore County police officers sent a dog into the room where the man was holed up. The man was subdued so that officers could arrest him.

Police had initial reports that the man was heavily armed - possibly with several guns. Heavily-armed SWAT teams quickly swarmed the area and began clearing the building.

Terrified staffers fled the building through a back door. Everyone was believed to be safe and accounted for within an hour of the incident.

However, four hours after the attack, SWAT officers discovered one lone staffer who had taken cover and was cut off from the rest of the employees.

The TV station is on lockdown. The TV news channel, an ABC affiliate, has not been able to get on air, but that hasn't stopped the staff from tweeting about the incident.

Brian Keubler, a WMAR reporter, wrote that he watched at the man ran up to the front doors of the TV station and pounded on the doors. He screamed that he was God and yelled 'Let me in!'

Frightening: Brian Kuebler, a WMAR-TV reporter, tweeted out live updates of the harrowing incident at his station

At least three heavily-armed SWAT teams have entered the building to search for the man, who is believed to be barricaded inside

Evacuating: SWAT officers have evacuated the building of all employees, according to WMAR-TV executives. SWAT officers are still searching for the suspect

Then, he got into a landscaping truck and rammed the doors at least three times before breaking through into the building.

So far, a head count in the TV station has revealed that none of the employees are missing or injured, Kuebler wrote.

Helicopter video from WJZ-TV shows a hole in the front of the building, large enough for a vehicle to enter. Drivers were still able to enter a neighboring shopping center, although a section of the road was blocked to traffic.

Two schools near the TV station are on lock-down as officers hunt for the suspect.

A stretch of busy York Road in Towson, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb, has been closed - disrupting traffic flow in the region.

Despite the show of arms, police arrested the suspect without incident
