Loss: Brandon Holt, 6, was shot dead in April after a neighbor found his father's gun

A father whose four-year-old son used one of his unsecured rifles to shoot dead a six-year-old neighbor as they played has pleaded not guilty and rejected a plea deal in the case.

Anthony Senatore, from Toms River, New Jersey, would have had to serve seven years in prison under the plea deal for six counts of child endangerment.

Senatore, 34, is accused of keeping a loaded .22-caliber rifle unsecured in his bedroom.

His son found it in April, took it outside to where his friend, Brandon Holt, was sitting in a golf cart and shot him once in the head as they were playing 'pretend shooting'.

Brandon died the following day - April 9 - at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune.

Senator's
lawyer, Robert Ebberup, said in court on Monday that Senatore is 
'deeply horrified over what took place and feels awful about it'.

'His
feelings go out to the family,' Ebberup said. 'Brandon Holt was a 
wonderful, wonderful little boy. We just hope that he's in heaven right 
now; we're sure he is.'

Despite the words of sympathy, the lawyer said Senatore should not have been charged with a crime.

Devastated: His parents, Ronald and Christine Holt, have filed a lawsuit against the father for $1 million

'This is a civil case,' he said. 'This does not belong in a criminal courtroom.'

Senatore did not speak during the hearing.

Prosecutors had offered him a plea 
deal in which he would have served seven years in state prison. He 
rejected that offer and plans to proceed toward trial, his lawyer said.

'We don't feel that jail is something that is appropriate,' Ebberup said.

If convicted in the trial, he faces up to 10 years in prison.

In addition to the gun used in the shooting, Senatore is charged with keeping five other firearms unsecured in his house, where they were allegedly accessible to his children, ages 12, 8 and 4.

Holt's family has filed a lawsuit against Senatore and his wife seeking more than $1 million, claiming their actions were reckless. After the death, the family donated Brandon's organs.

Brandon's father, Ron Holt, said at the time: 'We both decided that it would help carry his name, that he's helping somebody.'

Though Toms River is in Ocean County, the prosecutor's office in neighboring Atlantic County is handling the case at the direction of the state attorney general's office.

The switch was made because several members of Senatore's family have worked in law enforcement in Ocean County.

Under New Jersey law, 
residents do not need to register rifles, but they do need a gun 
purchaserâ€™s identification card to buy them.

It
is considered a disorderly persons' offense if someone fails to secure 
the weapon or install a trigger lock if a child younger than 16 can gain
access to loaded firearms in the home.

The next hearing in the case was scheduled for January 27.
