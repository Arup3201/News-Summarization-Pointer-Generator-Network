A video of a Delaware police officer enthusiastically lip-syncing to Taylor Swift's 'Shake it Off' is getting global attention.

The video, posted to the Dover Police Department's Facebook page Friday, shows Master Cpl. Jeff Davis in uniform and driving a patrol car while lip-syncing to the popular pop song - sassy head rolls and finger-pointing included.

The video appears also too perfect and internet-ready for the scene to spontaneous - but that hasn't stopped it from racking up more than 500,000 views in a matter of days.  

When he sees another car, he briefly stops his jamming, but swiftly continues when he accelerates away.

Calm: Master Cpl. Jeff Davis from Dover Police in Delaware is first seen in his patrol car in uniform. He turns on the radio to listen to Taylor Swift's Shake It Off 

Jamming: As the music starts, the department veteran starts to sing - and even incorporates some hand movements 

Department spokesman Cpt. Mark Hoffman said Saturday that he's gotten calls about the video from media outlets in Australia, England, Germany, and throughout the U.S. 

It has reached more than 470,000 YouTube views.

Hoffman says Davis, a 19-year veteran of the department, is 'the class clown' and loved making the video. 

He says the 48-year-old father of four knows 'Shake it Off' so well because of his 10-year-old daughter.

The department posted on Facebook: 'While reviewing dashcam footage, we come across some interesting sights to say the least. We decided we would share some with you in a new web series called "Dash Cam Confessionals". 

'We hope you enjoy this...and Taylor Swift, if you're watching...we're sorry.' 

Finger shaking: He shakes his hand in front of the dashcam when the chorus comes on

Scream: Then, when a high pitch note is reached in the song, he opens his mouth and really gets into it \
