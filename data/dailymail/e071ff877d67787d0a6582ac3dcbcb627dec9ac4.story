A country village has tracked down a half century of its carnival queens - except one. 

Villagers yesterday put out a public appeal to solve the mystery of their one missing carnival queen after tracking down 49 out of 50 of the women crowned carnival queen as girls since 1964.

Michelle Bevan was the village queen in 1976, but all attempts to trace her for a golden anniversary celebration failed.

26 of the of 49 carnival queens from Mathern near Chepstow, South Wales, since the competition started in 1964 

Most of the queens turned up for the 50th birthday party in the village of Mathern near Chepstow, South Wales, to remember the contest.  

The queens, many of them now mothers and grandmothers, took part in a carnival queen reunion parade and were shown pictures of their winning day. 

But despite appeals on social media, the carnival committee could not find Michelle, who would now be 50 years old. 

Villager Mary Pitt said: 'We tried everything to find Michelle but we had to admit we couldn't. 

'She moved from Mathern in the late 1970s and was believed to be living about 20 miles away in the Cwmbran area.

'It would have been great to have contacted her but all our efforts to find her failed.'

Carnival organiser Glenda Lewin said: 'It was shame we couldn't track down Michelle - we tried Facebook and other social websites without any luck.'

Most of the queens still live locally but villagers tracked down others from all over Britain including Scotland, Cornwall and North Wales.

Among the queens who turned up for the golden celebrations were mother and daughter Lavinia and Sarah Hardy, three sisters who won the title - Sue, Heather and Mickaela Neye were also in attendance.

And the first winner, Pat Skidmore, was there to watch as the 2014 queen, Matilda Birkett, 10, was crowned.

Mother-of-two Pat, 66, who left the village 50 years ago, said: 'It was lovely to go back and remember the happy times we had.

'It was fantastic the village managed to trace 49 of us.'

'I remember being crowned queen as if it was yesterday and the main competition was a piano-smashing contest.'
