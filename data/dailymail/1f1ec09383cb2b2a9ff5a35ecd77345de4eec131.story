The dead body of a Chinese street racer who killed himself in a horrific accident has been left in the road as a warning to other drivers.

The driver, 28-year-old Tao Lung, was speeding along in a £79,000 Jaguar F-Type when he crashed while trying to overtake another car.

The two cars were speeding at over 150mph
 on the residential street when another car pulled out of a house, 
causing one of the two racers to crash after it failed to brake in time.

Pedestrians gather around the body of 28-year-old Tao Lung, killed in China during a street race. Police deliberately left the body uncovered as an example to other driers

Lung, who was driving in Kunming city, 
Yunnan province, China, struck the kerb and hit a tree that tore off the roof and a wheel, throwing him from the vehicle

He was then run over by the second car which killed him instantly.

Residents said they were fed up with people racing on the street, and warned police it was only a matter of time before there was an accident.

The driver hit a car coming out of a driveway before slamming into a tree, throwing him from the vehicle

The body was left uncovered for an hour while police investigated the crash and cleared the wreckage of the sports car away

One said: 'Because the people here who drive fast are rich the police don't want to tackle them.'

When police arrived they did not cover up the body, but left it exposed in full view of the crowd.

A resident said: 'I think they wanted to get the message across that driving like this has a cost, sometimes its more than someone might want to pay. I think that was why they left the body lying there for so long.'

The corpse was left lying in the middle of the road for at least an hour in full view of pedestrians and other motorists, including children.

Police concluded their investigation, cleared away the wrecked vehicle, and only then was Lung's body loaded into a funeral van.

The Jaguar sports car he was driving has a supercharged engine and can accelerate from 0-60mph in just 4.2 seconds, with a top speed of 186 miles per hour.

The cars were said to be travelling at 150mph at the time, close to the Jaguar's top speed of 186mph

Residents in the neighbourhood have complained about street racing before and say that nothing has been done about it because the perpetrators are wealthy

China is responsible for at least 220,000 road deaths every year, more than any other country in the world, and contributing almost a quarter of people killed on the world's roads.

The country has roughly a third of the vehicles of the US, but has 20,000 more fatalities each year.

While street racing may be more famous in America and Tokyo, the Beijing Evening News reports that it is a growing trend in China, especially among young men.

Videos from across the country are regularly posted on YouTube and feature heavily modified cars going bumper-to-bumper, often in heavy traffic.

The races reportedly take place for respect and prestige, rather than money, with some clubs requiring members to be under a certain age and have cars worth a certain value.
