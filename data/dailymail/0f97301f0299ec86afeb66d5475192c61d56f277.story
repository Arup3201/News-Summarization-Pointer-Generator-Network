Despite being attacked by shark, 15-year-old Jesse McKinnon says he will be jumping back into the surf as soon as the 27 stitches are taken out of his knee in two weeks.

The South Australian teenager thought he had been bumped by a mate’s flipper when he was surfing at Middleton Point at 5pm on Wednesday, but soon realised it was a shark when he saw the dark shadow under the water.

Although in shock, Jesse quickly reacted by hitting the shark with his board and swimming to shore where his friends helped him to hospital.

Jesse McKinnon received 27 stitches to his right knee after a shark attacked him at Middleton Point in South Australia on Wednesday

The 15 year-old reacted quickly when he realised the dark shadow was a shark by hitting the predator with his board but not before it tore through his wetsuit (right) and ripped at his knee (left)

'I was talking to my mates and something was grabbing on my leg then I turned around and saw a shark next to my bodyboard, so gave it a nudge,’ he told MailOnline.

Jesse didn't realise the shark had mauled his right knee, which needed 27 stitches, unit he got to shore.

But the harrowing experience will not stop the Year 10 student from getting back out there when the stitches are removed in two weeks

‘It probably won’t happen ever again, so there’s no reason why I shouldn’t get back out there’ he said. ‘Sharks are rare in this area.’

However, Jesse’s mother, who was ‘pretty shaken up’ at the time, may not share the same the sentiment.

The harrowing experience has not perturbed the Year 10 student who will get straight back out there when his stitches come out in two weeks

'She probably won’t like it, but she’ll just have to get over it,’ he said.

His mates, who were also ‘weirded out’ by the experience, told Jesse that there was in fact three sharks in the water at the time.

Jesse has been watching movies while recuperating at home but has no intentions of hiring the shark thriller, Jaws, anytime soon.

It is the second shark attack to have occurred in the area in the past fortnight.

Another bodyboarder was bitten by 1.5m bronze whaler at Parsons Beach last Monday.
