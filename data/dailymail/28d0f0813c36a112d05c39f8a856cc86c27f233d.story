Prosecutors investigating a major Italian corruption scandal believe businessmen accused of bribing politicians involved in sanctioning a £4.5 billion flood barrier scheme in Venice used edible paper so all evidence of the plot could be eaten.

It is alleged that the list of politicians who received illegal payments was printed on the special paper so it could be quickly swallowed in the event of a police raid.

The Mayor of Venice, Giorgio Orsoni has been arrested as part of the investigation although he insisted to a judge that he is innocent of all charges.

Mayor of Venice, Giorgio Orsoni, pictured, has been placed under house arrest by police after he was accused of accepting £455,000 in illicit payments from developers behind the city's £4.5 billion flood defence scheme

In December 2008 the city suffered serious flooding after the sea rose to more than 1.6 metres above it's normal level, which was the highest flood in more than 30 years

The corruption claims surround the construction of a Venice's new flood defence system which is designed to protect the city from rising water level.

The Moses project was first considered in 1966 but work on the ambitious scheme was stalled until construction began in 2004 after concerns over the project's design, how it would be funded and its environmental impact.

Prosecutors investigating the scheme have issued 25 jail warrants and a further ten for house arrest. They are investigating claims of corruption, illicit party financing and tax fraud.

A 700-page document has been produced by authorities following a three-year investigation into the scheme.

Anti-corruption police launched a series of raids early this week and have seized assets worth £32 million.

It is believed that in return for illicit payments, politicians agreed to sign off on inflated invoices from the construction companies involved in building the project.

Construction on the ambitious scheme began in 2004 when investigators believe that a consortium behind the project used an £18 million slush fund to pay off politicians who in return signed off on inflated invoices

According to the Daily Telegraph, a member of the Consorzio Venezia Nuova consortium involved in the £4.5 billion project's construction told a consultant: 'Write it on different paper, edible paper. You can swallow it if someone arrives one day. I'm not joking.'

The conversation was recorded by police during their three-year investigation.

It is believed that politicians received illegal payments from an £18 million slush fund.

Mayor Orsoni is accused of receiving £455,000 from the scheme's developers to help fund his 2010 re election campaign.

His lawyer said Orsoni was 'very strained and suffering both in human terms and from the point of view of his office.'

Prosecutors have placed Mayor Orsoni under house arrest.

According to prosecutors: 'As the investigation continued, it emerged that most of these funds were used to buy political power ... and to bribe senior public officials.'

The first part of the ambitious flood protection scheme opened last year while the project is due to be completed in 2016.
