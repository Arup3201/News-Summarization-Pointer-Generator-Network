Four California men arrested for plotting to join al-Qaeda and fight alongside the Taliban prepared for their violent jihad against Americans by training at a local paintball range, the FBI has revealed.

FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the defendants are under arrest for plotting to bomb government facilities and public places.

According to the federal complaint 
unsealed on Monday during initial appearances, 34-year-old Sohiel Omar 
Kabir introduced two other California men to the radical Islamist 
doctrine of Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born radical cleric who was killed
 in a drone strike last year.

Authorities allege Kabir traveled to Afghanistan and communicated with the two - 23-year-old Ralph Deleon and 21-year-old Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales - so he could arrange for their travel to join him and meet with his contacts for terror organizations.

They later recruited 21-year-old Arifeen David Gojali.

The complaint says Deleon and Santana told an FBI source of their plans to train in Afghanistan, kill U.S. soldiers there and engage in 'violent jihad.'

The document also alleges the men 
went to a shooting range several times to fire pistols.

During a September 10 trip, Deleon told a confidential FBI source that he wanted to be on 
the front lines overseas and use C-4 explosives in an attack. 
Santana agreed.

'I wanna do C-4s if I could put one 
of these trucks right here with my, with that. Just drive into, like, 
the baddest military base,' Santana said, according to the complaint, 
adding that he wanted to use a large quantity of the explosive.

Whispers of terror: The four suspects were reportedly influenced by the writings of U.S.-born radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike last year

'If I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna take out a whole base. Might as well make it, like, big, ya know,' Santana said.

At the shooting range that day, both Santana and Deleon said they were excited about the rewards from becoming a shaheed, Arabic for martyr, according to the complaint.

In addition to practicing with real weapons, the men also reportedly trained with paintball guns.

The FBI says the men went to a paintball range to fire relatively harmless paintball guns at each other as part of their 'combat training.'

Authorities allege Kabir traveled to Afghanistan and communicated with Santana and Deleon so he could arrange for their travel to join him and meet with his contacts for terror organizations.

It wasn't immediately known if any of the men has an attorney. The FBI didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.

If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum penalty of 15 years in federal prison.
