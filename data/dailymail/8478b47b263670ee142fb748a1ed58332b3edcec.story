An insurance company is trying to avoid a payout for the Christmas Day blaze that killed three young girls, claiming their mother's boyfriend - and the home's contractor - had told a number of lies.

The inferno at Madonna Badger's mansion in Stamford, Connecticut claimed the lives of her children, nine-year-old Lily Badger, seven-year-old twins Sarah and Grace, and her elderly parents.

Now Utica First Insurance Company has filed a lawsuit claiming the policy holder Michael Borcina - who escaped the blaze with Madonna - had repeatedly misled the insurer since 2007.

Refusal: An insurance firm hopes to avoid paying out over the Connecticut fire, claiming contractor Michael Borcina lied to them. He is pictured with girlfriend Madonna Badger, whose children and parents were killed

The firm claims he had failed to tell the truth about the number of his employees, his company's annual receipts and payroll, and the type of work he did, the New York Post reported.

He also allegedly wrongly claimed his company, Tiberias Construction Inc., was not a
general contractor and did not carry out demolition, carpentry or 
exterior work over three storeys, it added.

If the suit filed at Manhattan Supreme Court is successful, no one would receive a payout - including Madonna Badger, her estranged husband Matthew, or the estates of the grandparents or children.

Borcina's attorney, David Grudberg, said he is looking at the insurance firm's complaint and will be responding in court.

'We are very disappointed that Tiberias Construction's insurance company is trying to get out from under its legal obligations,' he said.

Devastating: A blaze ravaged the waterfront mansion after smouldering embers from the fireplace were put outside and caught alight. It later emerged fire alarms at the home had not been installed

Devastated: Stamford firefighter Nick Tamburro pays respect outside the destroyed mansion. It emerged that Borcina's company did not have the required paperwork to be working on the home

Matthew Badger’s lawyer, Richard Emery, added: 'At first blush it certainly seems that the insurance company is trying to wiggle out of their responsibility to compensate Borcina's victims.'

Emery has previously put the blame on Borcina, saying he would sue 
the contractor after it emerged one floor should not have been occupied 
and fire alarms had not been installed.

In February, he said: 'That fact is that Borcina was the 
contractor on the job. He was aware of the dangers, or should have been 
aware of dangers, that a civilian would have been unaware of.

'The fact that kids were living in this house was unbelievable,' he said, adding the bereaved mother was not to blame as she cannot have known the dangers.

Construction workers who were helping with the home's renovation were also questioned following the deadly blazed as police sought to understand the cause.

Mr Borcina’s company was also heavily 
scrutinised during the investigation, and it was discovered that
several required forms were missing for the renovation work on the $1.7
million home.

The house did not have a new certificate of occupancy since the Badgers moved in, and Mr Borcina’s contracting licenses had expired at the time of the fire, it was reported in January.

His contractor registration for work in the state of Connecticut expired in 2000, and his home improvement license for the state of New York expired in June 2010.

It is also not the only time Mr Borcina has had a run in with the law over his construction sites.

Greenwich Time reported that he owes almost $100,000 in from previous legal judgements, and is also in the midst of two other lawsuits from clients- one in Manhattan and one in Long Island.

Stamford prosecutor David Cohen continues to review the investigation to decide whether criminal charges, such as involuntary manslaughter for unintentionally starting the fire, should be brought.

After the deadly 5 a.m. blaze at Mrs 
Badger's waterfront mansion, Borcina reportedly admitted he had taken 
embers from a fireplace as the girls were worried about Santa climbing 
down the chimney.

Bereaved: The girls' father Matthew Badger previously said he would sue his ex-wife's boyfriend

Remembered: He has set up a foundation to incorporate art into school lessons in the girls' memories

Fun: Mr Badger celebrated Christmas a day early with Sarah, Grace and Lily and said they were 'very happy'

He put them in a paper bag near a mud room outside - and they ignited and set the home alight.

The
three girls, who had celebrated Christmas at their father's Manhattan 
home the day before, perished in the fire along with their grandparents 
Lomer, 71, and Pauline Johnson, 69.

Mr Johnson was a department store Santa Claus who had worked as safety director for a Louisville, Kentucky, company. The day before his death he had worked as Santa at Saks Fifth Avenue.

Mrs
Badger, 47, a former Calvin Klein art director, and her boyfriend escaped the flames.

After the girls' funerals on January 5, she 
reportedly tried to kill herself and is now said to be in deep isolated 
mourning as she struggles to come to terms with the deaths.

Matthew Badger spoke out earlier this week to reveal the grief he has suffered since his daughters were killed. 'The experience of memories about their lives has been one of tears,' he told GMA.

Struggle: While Matthew Badger, holding a picture of Sarah in a tribute video created for the fund, has spoken out about his loss, his estranged wife is said to be in deep isolated mourning

Grief: Borcina is seen comforting Madonna and Matthew Badger at their daughters' funerals

'Every time I open my computer and look 
at pictures of them, I am moved,' he said. 'It was very difficult to 
see. Why did this happen? I mean, it doesn't make any sense.'

But he added he has channelled this pain into something positive, creating the Lily Sarah Grace Fund to raise money for public schools to incorporate art into their lessons.

'It's
really hard,' he went on. 'People treat their grief in different ways. 
Either they head straight into the wind [or] some people hide behind a 
rock.

'I had a very hard time making sense 
of what life was. The instinct of a father for me was that I needed to 
love my children and that love I channelled into the creation of the 
Lily Sarah Grace Fund.

'I need to try and make them have made a mark on the planet, and not have just died in vain.'

Following the December 25 tragedy, Stamford Fire Chief Antonio Conte said the fire was the town's deadliest since a 1987 blaze that also killed five people.
