Prison: Unlicensed cab driver Paul Causer, 39, drove a clubber to the Surrey countryside and raped her, a court heard today

An unlicensed taxi driver who drove a clubber to the countryside and raped her was caught after an iPhone app tracked his cab, a court heard today.

Paul Causer, 39, picked up the 31-year-old woman as she queued at a taxi rank outside McQueen bar in Shoreditch, east London, in the early hours of the morning.

He then drove her 22 miles to a secluded spot in Godstone, Surrey, before forcing her to perform a sex act on him.

But he was caught after the victim left her iPhone in the car - and its 'Where's my iPhone' tracker app revealed his location.

Now, Causer has been jailed for 11 years after being convicted of rape at London's Old Bailey.

The court heard that Causer, from Deptford, south-east London, had picked up his victim after she had been out drinking with a friend on August 3 last year.

The woman told him she had no cash to get back home to Battersea, south London, so he agreed to drive her to a nearby cash point and withdraw the £20 fare they had decided on.

But when they pulled up to the cash point, Causer was filmed on CCTV making several unsuccessful attempts to take £300, £200, 
and £120 from her account using the PIN code and bank card she had 
given him.

He then drove the victim to Bone Mill Lane, Godstone, while she slept on the back seat of the cab.

He knew the lane was secluded because he had previously attended ‘dogging’ sessions there, the court heard.

At this point, the woman woke up and realising she was not at home, pleaded: 'Why are you doing this to me? I'm a good person.'

But Causer ignored her pleas - and instead, forced her to perform oral sex on him, the court heard.

He then told her something was wrong with his car and forced her to climb out, before speeding off at around 5am.

The woman was later discovered by a security guard, who led her to safety and called the police.

Officers launched an investigation and found Causer had borrowed the car from a friend. They then successfully tracked down the vehicle using the victim’s iPhone app.

Sentencing Causer, Judge Anthony Morris QC said: ‘You chose that location [Bone Mill Lane] because it was remote, unlit and a no through road.

‘You did so with a view to forcing her to have oral sex with you.

'You were familiar with the lane because
 you had been there previously on dogging expeditions to take part in 
sex activities there.'

He added: ‘I am satisfied you realised how drunk and vulnerable [the victim] was.

'You
 tricked her into getting out of the car and drove off, abandoning her 
at 5am in total darkness in a country lane she was unfamiliar with.’

Judge Morris said the woman’s life had been shattered by the rape, and she is now considering leaving the capital because of the ordeal. 

‘She still replays the events in the lane in her mind, day and night’, he said.

‘The sheer horror of it remains, and she feels you have taken away her trust in people.

‘She found it difficult at first to leave the flat, and even now she is not carefree. She and her partner are now seeking work away from London because she no longer feels safe here.’

Causer, who admitted three counts of attempted theft before the case began, was convicted of one charge of rape but acquitted of theft by a jury at an earlier trial.

His family have abandoned him following the conviction, and no one has visited him in prison, the court heard.

Causer was handed eight-month concurrent sentences for each of the attempted thefts.

He used a crutch to get into the dock and showed no emotion as he was led away.
