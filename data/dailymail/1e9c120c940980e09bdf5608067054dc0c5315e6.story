Marie Harf, the embattled State Department deputy spokeswoman who insisted this week that helping ISIS jihadis find gainful employment was a better strategy than killing them, is not in line for a promotion when her boss moves to the White House on April 1, a State Department official said Thursday.

Harf said Monday night on MSNBC that 'lack of opportunity for jobs' in the Middle East should be America's focus in the war against the ISIS terror army.

She refused to back down Tuesday night on CNN, insisting that the Obama administration should 'get at the root causes' of terrorism. 'It might be too nuanced an argument for some,' she sniped at her legions of critics. 

Those mockworthy moments, a State Department official said Thursday, 'are going to keep her from the top job.'

Marie Harf has hit her career ceiling as the State Department's deputy spokeswoman, according to an official, since her recent TV appearances didn't inspire confidence in her ability to take the top job

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, shown during Thursday's press briefing, will become President Barack Obama's new communications director, and is expecting a child in the summer

'Jen's move to the White House isn't something that happened overnight,' the official said, 'and Marie's TV appearances were an audition of sorts, a test run, and she failed spectacularly.' 

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki will become President Barack Obama's new communications director, replacing Democratic media strategist Jennifer Palmieri, who will join Hillary Rodham Clinton's likely presidential campaign.

In a statement, Obama embraced Palmieri as a 'good friend' and praised her as a 'brilliant and effective communications director and trusted adviser.'

'I'd say Jen is irreplaceable – if Jen Psaki hadn't agreed to step in...' Obama said. 'I fully trust Jen – and I am thrilled she's agreed to come back to the White House as communications director.'

Psaki took issue with the characterization of Harf's situation as a dead-end, telling Daily Mail Online after this story was published that 'anyone who is commenting anonymously on personnel decisions is not a decision maker.'

'Marie Harf is a smart, savvy, integral member of the State Department team who has run point on issues ranging from the Iran negotiations to efforts to degrade and defeat ISIL,' Psaki said.

Reporters in a State Department briefing on Thursday congratulated her on the promotion, while noting that her unorthodox approach to the job has drawn detractors.

'You will be missed by us and, I'm sure, by your legion of fans around the world,' an Associated Press reporter said drily, bringing a chorus of laughter from the press corps.

Psaki drew the most criticism for implementing what Republicans have derided as 'hashtag diplomacy,' using messages on Twitter to express State Department positions from a distance without directly engaging foreign powers and murderous rebel groups.

Psaki will be returning to the White House where she helped craft Obama's message during the president's first term.

She has been part of Obama's team since 2007, when she was traveling press secretary during his first presidential campaign.

The move allows Obama to replace a senior adviser with a familiar aide who is already steeped in issues confronting the White House.

Psaki has become a frequent face of the State Department as spokeswoman for Secretary of State John Kerry, often traveling the world.

Although she came from the Obama camp, she was seen as close to Kerry and accurate in conveying his policy positions.

A White House official said Psaki informed Obama and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough that she is expecting a baby in July. 

The official said Obama and McDonough made a commitment to Psaki to find flexible ways to make her new post work. 

Psaki will serve as an assistant to the president, the same status as White House press secretary Josh Earnest.

Psaki will rejoin deputy communications director Amy Brundage, with whom she worked during the 2008 campaign and in 2010 when they undertook the media strategy for Obama's economic agenda.

Obama's communications team has been focused on pushing the domestic policy ideas he spelled out in his State of the Union speech. 

But Psaki would no doubt also be involved in helping shape the White House message on the myriad international issues confronting the president, including Ukraine, Israel, Iran and the Islamic State militants.

Palmieri is part of a White House exodus of top advisers. John Podesta, who served as counselor to the president, also stepped aside to take a senior role in Clinton's expected campaign. 

And senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, an Obama veteran from his first presidential campaign, has announced he is leaving.

Obama replaced Podesta with Brian Deese, a veteran White House aide and a deputy director in his budget office. 

With Deese and Psaki, Obama is signaling that he wants to rely on known insiders to advise him during what he has called the 'fourth quarter' of his presidency.
