A Georgia man landed in the intensive care unit after getting his 6-year-old niece away from a falling tree and saving her life.

Dwight Dupree, of Gillsville, Ga., was crushed by a tree limb seconds after telling his young niece to run for safety when they were playing under the large tree last week, according to WGCL-TV.

'He told me to run and then boom a tree hit him,' Dupree's niece, Cara Johnson, said.

'I called my mom. And then they took him to the hospital,' Cara said.

Another relative said Dupree pushed Cara out of the way before he was crushed when the tree fell on the afternoon of June 19.

'He was sitting under the tree and heard a big crack,' Donta Ware, Dupree’s nephew, told the Gainsville Times. 'He had his niece with him and tried to push her out of the way — she’s OK, but the tree caught him across the small of the back.'

Cara's brother heard the tree fall from inside the Johnson's home in Hall County. Josh Johnson, 16, ran outside and found his uncle on the ground under a tree branch.

'It was sort of like a meteor, earthquake thing,' Josh said, describing the crushing snap of the tree. 'I just moved it out the way so the medics could get by him.'

Dupree was taken to a nearby hospital where doctors originally believed he only hurt his back. After further evaluation, Dupree was taken into emergency surgery to treat a cracked spine and internal bleeding. As of Thursday night, Dupree was in stable condition.

Cara's father, Jeff Johnson, thanked God and Dupree for saving his daughter.

'He saved her life. If she had stayed up in there it probably would have crushed both of them,' Johnson said. 'It's a blessing. May God be with him.'

Johnson said the tree looked rotten on the inside when he came home from work after the accident. The tree, which sits in Johnson's front yard, was hit by lightening a few years ago.

'It just caught us off guard,' Johnson said of the accident.

The tree also knocked down a power line, according to the Times.

Dupree and his niece often play under the tree in the yard together, Ware said.

'Every day they sit out under the tree and try to enjoy the shade,' Ware said. 'It was a rotten tree — I knew one day it would fall. I feel like my uncle saved her life.'

Ware lives a few minutes away from the Johnson's and rushed to the scene after the accident. Ware said that despite the 'big gash in the small of his back,' Dupree was moving and conscious when paramedics took him away.

One of the tree's larger limbs landed on Cara's wagon, trapping her teddy bear.

'He got crushed,' Cara said to WGCL-TV about her bear, though the station notes Cara was unaware as of last week the extent of her uncle's injuries.

But she was able to explain why her uncle always played with her on the front yard.

'Because he loves me,' Cara said.
