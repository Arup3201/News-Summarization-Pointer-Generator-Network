Two of Pope Francis's great-nephews and their mother, the wife of his nephew, were killed in a car crash this morning, the Vatican has announced.

Their car collided with a truck carrying grain just after midnight near Cordoba, central Argentina, just after midnight, according to the Vatican and local media.

One great-nephew was two, the other was only eight-months. The age of their mother wasn't immediately available.

Emanuel Bergoglio, the pope's nephew, who was driving the car, is in a serious condition in hospital.

DYN news agency said the accident happened shortly after midnight when Mr Begoglio's car slammed into the back of a truck carrying grains. 

Vatican spokesman the Reverend Federico Lombardi said 'the pope was informed about the tragic accident. He is deeply pained.'

He added the pope asks 'all who share in his grief to unite with him in prayer.'

The deaths came after Francis last night gave himself only another 'two or three years' to live. 

'I see it as the generosity of the people of God. I try to think of my sins, my mistakes, not to become proud. Because I know it will last only a short time,' he said. 

Then, apparently light-heartedly, he added: 'Two or three years and then I'll be off to the Father's House.'

While the 77-year-old pope has not spoken publicly before about when he might die, a Vatican source said he had previously told those close to him that he thought he only had a few years left.
