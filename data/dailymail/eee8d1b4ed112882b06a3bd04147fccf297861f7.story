All-inclusive: The Ministry of Defence spent a total of £111million in ¿Continuity of Education Allowance¿, some £89.4million of which was on boarding school fees for UK-based personnel

Thousands of military officers and civil servants have their children’s boarding school fees paid by the taxpayer even though they are based in the UK.

Almost £100million of state money went last year towards educating children at private schools, including Fettes, Winchester, Roedean and Marlborough, even though their parents are not overseas.

In total, the Government spends around £130million a year on school fees. But the latest figures show that only around a quarter of that is for parents based overseas.

The Ministry of Defence spent a total of £111million in ‘Continuity of Education Allowance’ for 8,400 service children across 440 schools, 35 of which are state boarding schools.

More than three-quarters of this – some £89.4million – was on boarding school fees for UK-based personnel.

They receive the money to take into account the fact they may be moved around Britain at short notice – a serviceman could be in Somerset one year, and Scotland the next.

At the Foreign Office, £15million is spent on boarding school fees for 456 staff at an average of £33,800. More than half is for UK-based staff.

The fees are designed for civil servants posted overseas but continue to be paid on the official’s return if their child has started a GCSE or A-level course. It means the taxpayer can pay the school fees for up to two years after the end of a posting.

The Department for International 
Development, which funnels taxpayers money abroad in aid projects,  paid
£1million in school fees for 42 civil servants, including £141,000 to 
parents who are in Britain.

The figures were released following a parliamentary question by Labour Treasury spokesman Rachel Reeves.

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘This is an expensive perk that shouldn’t apply to those now based in the UK.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘Service personnel should not be disadvantaged because of their duty but we are determined CEA should go only to those who really need it.

Expense: The Government spends around £130million a year on school fees, sending to children to top school, such as Roedean Independent School in Brighton (pictured)

'That is why we tightened the criteria last year which has resulted in a saving of £10million on the previous year.’

Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt said: ‘Members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world, sometimes at very short notice. We provide financial support to all diplomatic staff, irrespective of grade, who serve overseas.’

Aid minister Alan Duncan said: ‘The conditions of employment in DfID are set to recruit, motivate and retain staff who are skilled.’
