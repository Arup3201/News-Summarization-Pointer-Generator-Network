It is seen as the modern rite of passage - a stag weekend in a European city ahead of a groom's big day.

But if you're looking for a boys-only trip without breaking the bank, then you can forget Ibiza and had better head to Bratislava instead.

According to the latest statistics, the Slovakian capital is the best budget spot for celebrating your last days of singledom with  mates. 

No.1 Currency has named Bratislava, Slovakia the best value stag do getaway destination

Bonding with your pals in Bratislava doesn't have to be expensive - 'stag do essentials' add up to just £96

Michael's Gate is a popular tourist destination in the inexpensive Slovakian capital

According to No.1 Currency, when the ultimate stag party essentials are compared across top European destinations, the Slovakian hotspot comes out on top for best value, while Ibiza is ranked the worst value.

1. Bratislava, Slovakia - £96

2. Dublin, Ireland - £115

3. Tallinn, Estonia - £128 

4. Barcelona, Spain - £131

5. Budapest, Hungary - £154

6. Blackpool, UK - £165

7. Prague, Czech Republic - £168

8. Berlin, Germany - £188

9. Magaluf, Spain - £193

10. Ibiza, Spain - £302 

Stag do trip essentials include: a return flight, one night's stay in a youth hostel, a pint of beer, a fry up, a Big Mac, entry to a nightclub, tickets to a football match, and a taxi ride.

The figures reveal that Bratislava offers the best deal, with all essentials costing only £96.

In Ibiza, however, these essentials added up to a whopping £302.

For a slightly less pricey option, take a short boat ride to Magaluf, where the same party favours will cost you more than £100 less - though still far more than the Slovakian capital. 

Dublin also comes in as an affordable stag do getaway option thanks to cheap flights from London.

However, the Irish city is home to the most expensive pint - at £3.45 a pop - so what you save in air travel, you will likely make up for in beverages.

When it comes to a cheap drink, Prague comes out on top, with a pint of beer costing less than £1 - just 87p.

Ibiza tops the list as most expensive stag do destination - costing a whopping £302 for all the 'essentials'

In Bratislava, you can enjoy a pint of beer for as little as £1.04 and entry to a club is as low as £6

Simon Phillips, Head of Retail for No.1 Currency said: 'Going abroad for a stag weekend is very popular amongst soon-to-be-wed Brits, and with considerable cost savings to be made, it's easy to understand why.'

'With budget airlines offering some great deals to European cities, you may find your flights are actually a lot cheaper than a lot of UK train fares.'

'Eastern Europe offers some of the best value for money, with cities such as Bratislava, Tallinn and Budapest boasting cheap accommodation, club entry, and perhaps most importantly, cheap pints.'
