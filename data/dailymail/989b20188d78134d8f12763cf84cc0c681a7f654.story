Brenda Branch defied her daughter's school to send her on holiday during term time and is furious with her £50 fine from the council

A college teacher who was hit with a £50 fine for taking her daughter out of school during term time to go on holiday has said she is ‘fuming’ at the punishment.

Brenda Branch asked for permission to keep 12-year-old daughter Serena out of Philips High School in Whitefield, Bury for a family break at Butlins in Skegness.

She had hoped the school would be flexible about the time off because all the exams had been completed.

But when staff rejected the request 
Mrs Branch, 43, who teaches psychology at Oldham Sixth Form College, decided to 
send Serena on holiday with her grandparents and cousin anyway.

She
said that she and her husband, Garry, 47, who works for Salford 
council’s social services department, could not afford to take their 
three daughters away during the summer holidays.

It meant the break in Butlins was the only holiday Serena could have this year.

Now her parents have been given a fixed penalty notice by Bury council for the six days unauthorised absence.

Mrs
Branch, of Balmoral Avenue, Whitefield, said: 'I am a teacher myself 
and I know that not a lot of work gets done at the end of the year.

'They told me it was not school 
policy, but they could show a bit of flexibility. All exams were 
finished. I didn’t want Serena to be disappointed so I let her go.'

She
said her daughter had a 99 per cent attendance record before the family
made the holiday request and has also received a number of awards for 
her academic work.

Serena, 
who has just finished her first year at the school, said that she also 
thought it was unfair that her mum had got a fine.

Daughter Serena, 12, says her parents' fine is unfair and that her friends did little school work in the time she was away with her extended family

She said: 'I spoke to my friends and they said they had just watched movies, and played games and not done much work while I was away.'

Chris Trees, head teacher at the 894-pupil school, said that permission for absence during term time is only granted in ‘exceptional circumstances’ such as family bereavements.

He said: 'It’s not true that the kids were just sitting around watching the videos. A lot of classes were carrying on with their work.'

The government has looked at plans to clamp down truancy after a figures released in March showed term time holidays made up 9.5 per cent of all school absence in 2010/11, up from 9.3 per cent the previous year.

Councils can fine parents if their child takes an unauthorised holiday from school under the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003.

The fine is £50 if paid within 28 days and rises to £100 after that time. 

Parents can be taken to court and could end up with a criminal record if they do not cough up.
