Bookmakers believe a low draw will not be a disadvantage to favourite Watchable in the Ayr Gold Cup as trainer David O'Meara runs the gelding six days after he landed a valuable sprint at the Curragh. 

High stands' side stalls were most popular at the draw but Watchable, brother to John Gosden's 2008 1,000 Guineas fourth Infallible, landed stall five. 

Orient class, winner of the only sprint handicap on yesterday's card, was drawn in 18 but but statistics for the last 20 years of the Ayr Gold Cup show a near even distribution of winners.

Jon Ivan-Duke of sponsors William Hill, who make Watchable 8-1 favourite, said: ‘Usually what matters is where the pace is and Watchable is drawn next to (speedy) Hamza (stall six).’

O’Meara, whose stable jockey Danny Tudhope rides Watchable, also runs Royal Ascot winner and last year’s runner-up Louis The Pious (James Doyle) and Highland Acclaim (Sam James) in an attempt to win Scotland’s biggest Flat race for the first time.

Jump jockey Jason Maguire returns from six months on the sidelines with rides at Newton Abbot and Worcester.

Donald McCain’s stable jockey has not ridden since being kicked in the stomach in a fall at Stratford on March 10, the day before the Cheltenham Festival.

Maguire required emergency surgery to stem bleeding to his liver as well as fracturing his sternum.

The jockey said: ‘It's been a long time watching on the sidelines and I'm really looking forward to it. When you are out that length of time it makes you appreciate what you have, riding for a powerful stable.

‘I was aiming to be back at the end of the month, but I got passed (by the doctor) earlier this week, so that was grand. I can't wait.’

Trainer Colin Tizzard has revealed that last season’s King George VI Chase winner Cue Card has had an operation to aid his breathing.

The gelding, to be ridden by Daryl Jacob this season after the retirement of Tizzard’s jockey son Joe, missed the Cheltenham Gold Cup because of a stress fracture of his pelvis.

The gelding’s early season target will be the Betfair Chase at Haydock in November, a race he won last year.
