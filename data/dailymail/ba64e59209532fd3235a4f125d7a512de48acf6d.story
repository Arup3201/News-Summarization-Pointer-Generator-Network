John Terry is used to facing predators in the Premier League every week - but this weekend he came up against creatures of a different kind.

The Chelsea captain shared a video on his Instagram of him scuba diving at the Atlantis Hotel in Dubai.

The 33-year-old is taking a holiday in the Middle East during the international break.

He said on Instagram: 'What a great experience Scuba Diving at the Atlantis.'

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will hope the defender can make a quick transition back to football when his team face West Brom on Saturday.

The Blues are four points clear of Southampton atop the Premier League and are unbeaten in their first 11 games.
