This is the moment honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani is alleged to have handed a bag of cash to his taxi driver in return for orchestrating the killing of his wife Anni.

The previously unseen CCTV footage shows millionaire Dewani meeting Zola Tongo – who has been jailed for 18 years for organising the murder. It was recorded three days after Dewani’s bride was shot dead in South Africa.

The footage, taken from the five-star Cape Town hotel where the honeymoon couple were staying, shows the two men entering the internet room. Dewani arrives carrying a white plastic bag and, after a brief meeting, Tongo departs carrying the same bag at his side.

Riddle: Shrien Dewani arrives at the internet room of the Cape Town hotel, where he and Anni were staying in South Africa

At the hotel: Carrying a bag, Shrien is followed by Zola Tongo - who has been jailed for organising the murder

Tongo claims the bag contained 1,000 
South African rand (about £82) in cash which was  his payment for 
arranging the murder. But Dewani claims he owed the driver the money for
his services as a tour guide.

The
security camera footage from the Cape Grace Hotel has been obtained by 
the BBC’s Panorama team as part of a programme investigating the murder.

The
footage also shows Anni, 28, and Dewani, now 32, kissing and embracing 
in an apparent display of affection just three hours before Anni was in 
the hands of her killers.

This
contrasts with separate CCTV footage, previously obtained by this 
newspaper, showing Dewani and Anni walking yards apart that same night.

Tongo later leaves with the bag. He claims the bag contained 1,000 South African rand (about £82) in cash which was his payment for arranging the murder

Previously unseen: The footage was recorded three days after Anni was shot dead

Suggestions of distance between the newlyweds were bolstered by claims from Anni’s best friend and cousin, who said the bride had tried to call off the wedding after throwing her engagement ring at Dewani  during one of their numerous arguments.

Dewani is accused of paying two hitmen  £1,400 to kill his wife. He denies the accusations.

Last
year Home Secretary Theresa  May rubber-stamped his extradition order 
after a campaign by Anni’s bereaved family, who demanded Dewani stand 
trial. He  has appealed against the decision to the  High Court.

In
the footage, Dewani is shown talking to Anni’s father, Vinod Hindocha, 
after they had been to see Anni’s body at a morgue. Cameras show Tongo, 
in a white cap, shirt and shorts, walking through the hotel’s front 
entrance empty-handed.

Dewani then walks towards the internet 
room carrying the plastic bag, closely followed by the driver. Tongo 
emerges again, after one minute, with a bag-shaped object bulging under 
his shirt.

... but do these pictures show a couple in love?

He then enters the toilets before leaving the hotel openly carrying the bag. Panorama claims a mystery couple were in the internet room with them who would have witnessed the handover.

The footage also tracks Anni and Dewani’s movements on the evening of November 13, 2010 – hours before Anni’s disappearance.

She
presses her body up against Dewani as they kiss tenderly in the lobby. 
Briefly, she pulls away as he takes her picture on his phone before she 
is back into his arms in an embrace.

Earlier, in the hotel bar, Dewani  
zips up a loose fastening on his bride’s dress, after which she reaches 
across and strokes his thigh. Dewani then puts his arms around Anni, 
pulling her in, and they kiss again.

The
footage contrasts with CCTV showing the couple at the Surfside 
restaurant in Strand, a resort 30 miles south-east of Cape Town, which 
Tongo drove them to.

Timed at 9.33pm, the recording shows Dewani, with hands thrust in his pockets, walking ahead of his elegant bride who, with her head bowed, fiddles with her handbag five paces behind.

At about 11pm, Anni was kidnapped and later murdered as the couple’s taxi drove through the notorious township of Gugulethu.

The
distance between the pair appeared to grow in significance after Anni’s
cousin, Sneha Hindocha, claimed Anni had tried to call off her lavish 
£200,000 wedding in India just days before the ceremony.Sneha said Anni threw her engagement ring at Dewani after an  argument.

It
was also claimed Sneha received more than 100 texts from Anni which 
charted a turbulent and at times unhappy relationship with her 
husband-to-be.

Other footage shows the moment the British businessman is alleged to have commissioned Tongo to arrange the murder. It shows Anni entering the hotel alone the day before the killing. Dewani is left alone with Tongo for five minutes on the hotel’s forecourt. The driver has claimed this was when Dewani told him he wanted a client ‘taken off the scene’.

Charlotte Harris, the Dewani  family’s lawyer, said: ‘Shrien has not been charged with any offence in any country. He is innocent and has always maintained his commitment to clearing his name of all the false allegations against him.’

The Dewani family declined to comment.

Panorama Special: The Honeymoon Murder will be shown on BBC1 on Thursday at 9pm.
