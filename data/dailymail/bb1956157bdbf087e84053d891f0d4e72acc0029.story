Furious: Local government minister Bob Neill (pictured) said the decision by some councils to give its councillors inflation-busting pay rises was 'completely unjustifiable'

Hundreds of councillors awarded themselves inflation-busting rises in allowances last year.

Figures show that a dozen town halls did so despite the pay freeze for many local government workers.

One council increased allowances by 28 per cent – the first stage of an 85 per cent rise over three years.

The hikes, which came even as local authorities made vocal protests about the impact of the Government’s budget cuts, have been condemned by local government minister Bob Neill as ‘completely unjustifiable’.

There have been repeated complaints that allowances – which are paid automatically to all elected councillors and are not linked to the amount of work they do or meetings they attend – have been overly generous.

They cost taxpayers more than £200million a year, with several town halls doubling their allowances over the past seven years.

The latest national breakdown of increases has been published by the TaxPayers’ Alliance, which found 32 councils raised allowances between the financial year 2010/11, the Coalition’s first year in power, and 2011/12.

Twelve raised them by more than 4 per cent – the level of inflation at the start of the last financial year as taken from the consumer price index.

They included Boston borough council in Lincolnshire, which gave its 32 elected members a 28 per cent increase to push the basic allowance paid to a councillor with no special responsibilities from £2,378 a year to £3,052.

A further increase to £3,727 followed this spring, and next year there will be another rise to £4,400. This will amount to an 85 per cent hike since 2010, pushing basic pay from £46 to £85 a week.

Peter Bedford, leader of the council, argued that allowances for the authority ‘lagged far behind all others in Lincolnshire’.

In Slough, allowances went up  by 19 per cent in the autumn of 2010 from £5,973 to £7,100. ‘It was the first time in seven years that the allowance was increased,’ a council spokesman said. ‘Our allowances were considerably lower than those in neighbouring boroughs.’

In fact, Slough is bordered on three sides by South Buckinghamshire district council, which pays its councillors a basic £4,100 a year.

Of the 12 which raised allowances above inflation, five councils also increased council tax.

The TPA pointed to major differences between the allowances in neighbouring authorities, and questioned why Manchester pays £16,000 while next door Trafford pays less than £6,500.

Of large metropolitan authorities, Birmingham pays £16,267 – almost £10,000 more than Trafford. TPA chief executive Matthew Sinclair said: ‘With local authorities up and down the country having to rein in spending, councillors who have awarded themselves an increase in their allowances in defiance of government advice should hang their heads in shame.

'They cannot retain the moral authority to make tough decisions on spending.’

Mr Neill said: ‘Most councils have frozen or cut councillor allowances to do their bit.

‘However, a small minority have hiked them which is completely unjustifiable given rank-and-file workers in local government have faced a pay freeze. These councils should be held to account.’
