A college football fan inflicted a horrifying sexual assault on a rival supporter after he passed out in a fast food restaurant following the game.

A video taken on a camera phone showed a group of students from Alabama University surround the Louisiana State University student who is slumped over a table passed out, at a Krystal restaurant in New Orleans on January 9.

The footage was uploaded to the Alabama University sports channel BamaSportsForum on YouTube - and promptly deleted after it swept the Internet. It shows a man climbing on top of the rival fan and rubbing his genitals repeatedly in his face.

The alleged sexual assault happened following a game between the two colleges during the Bowl Championship Series where Alabama beat LSU 21-0.

The clip, which lasts for five minutes shows a group dressed in crimson Alabama shirts placing cartons on the young man's head while whooping and cheering, snapping pictures on their camera phones.

One voice, off camera, says: 'This guy's life is over.'

The hazing continues with rival fans 
sticking straws up the man's nose and leaning over him while football 
chants echo around the fast food joint, where hundreds of fans have 
gathered.

Another man adds: 'Seriously, I don't see him moving' before adding, 'someone has to pour water on him.'

The man shifts slightly in the seat with his head slumped on the table but remains unconscious.

It is then that a rival fan, dressed in a baseball cap, red hoodie and khaki shorts pulls his genitals out of his pants and climbs over the other man, grinding into face.

The identity of the man who carried out 
the attack was yet to be revealed and it was uncertain whether he was a 
college student. 

Two students in the clip have been identified by Deadspin.com - Patrick Setterstrom and his blonde girlfriend Ellen
Cassin. He appears to attempt to expose himself at the start of the 
video before his girlfriend restrains him. Since the clip appeared both 
have deleted their Facebook profiles.

The
recent college graduate is the son of Alabama's WKRG TV station's 
sports director Randy Patrick Setterstrom. The station admitted that it 
was their director's 22-year-old son.

Remi Braden, director of public 
affairs at New Orleans Police Department, told MailOnline: 'We were 
alerted to the video last Sunday and immediately started a preliminary 
investigation. 

'No one in the restaurant where the 
incident occurred contacted police but the investigation is ongoing. 
Because this is a possible sexual battery case, we are not in a position
to release more information at this time.'

The victim may not necessarily have to come forward as charges can be brought in the name of the state.

However Ric Simmons, a criminal law professor at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, points out that this is a far from a straightforward case.

He told MailOnline: 'Technically a prosecutor does not need a victim to prosecute a crime, as long as there is other evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

'But although it is possible to obtain a conviction in a case like this without a victim, it will be difficult to do so. A jury may not take the case very seriously if there is no victim willing to testify.

'In this case, as reprehensible as the conduct may appear to some, others may see it as merely a crude college prank which does not rise to the level of criminal behavior. 

'That perspective will only be reinforced if the victim does not care enough about the case to come forward.  Given this challenge, a prosecutor’s office may be reluctant to commit their scarce resources to prosecuting such a case.'

Professor Simmons teaches criminal law at Ohio State. Prior to becoming a law professor, he was an assistant district attorney for New York County.
