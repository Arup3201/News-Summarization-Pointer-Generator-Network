A Portuguese male model accused of brutally murdering his older lover during a fight castrated the victim and then wore his testicles on his wrists to harness their power, the defendant's lawyer told the jury Friday.

According to attorney Rubin Sinins, Renato Seabra murdered noted Portuguese fashion journalist Carlos Castro, 65, during an hour-long psychotic fit that took place at the InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan last year.

After hitting the older man with a computer monitor and stomping on his head, Sinins said his client cut off his testicles using a corkscrew and slit his own wrists.

Insanity defense: Seabra's attorney claims the 21-year-old man snapped and killed Castro in a psychotic fit during which he castrated the older man with a corkscrew and wore his testicles on his own wrists

'He put one [testicle] on each wrist,' Sinins told the court. 'He did this for his protection. He could also harness the power. He wandered the streets of Manhattan, touching people, because he had the power to cure people from AIDS, because he had the power to cure them.'

The lawyer went on, telling the jury that Seabra explained to police the day after the murder that ‘he believed Mr. Castro's testicles were demons, and that by pulling them out everything would be right with the world,’ the New York Post reported.

Seabra's attorney revealed the sensational details of the murder during his opening statment in an attempt to bolster the 21-year-old’s insanity defense, which hinges on a claim that the male model suddenly snapped.

'He willingly told police. He wanted to explain why he killed Mr. Castro, because he thought what he had done was right, Sinins said.

The lawyer asked the jury to acquit Seabra by reason of insanity, with the possibility of being committed to a psychiatric facility, according to the New York Daily News.

‘He was in another world,’ Sinins told jurors. ‘He was deluded into thinking that he was a special messenger from God, on a mission to make the world a better place.’

However, the prosecution implored the panel not to believe the psychotic episode story, insisting that there was nothing in the 21-year-old’ medical history to suggest even a hint of mental illness.

District Attorney Maxine Rosenthal described Seabra as a hot-headed gold-digger who realized that his free ride was over and killed Castro out of anger, not insanity.

Castro met the ambitious male model in Portugal in May of 2011 and the two started seeing each other.

In January, the 65-year-old TV journalist and gay activist flew Seabra to New York, where the younger man was hoping to find modelling work through a Manhattan agency.

'He want[ed] to be famous and make money. He also wanted nice things — clothes, electronics, gifts for his family. He wanted to eat in nice restaurants. When Carlos Castro showed up in Renato Seabra's life, he saw a means to an end and he got on board.'

But the relationship between the two began turning sour when Castro caught Seabra going out with a group of young women.

On
January 7, tensions came to a head when Seabra and Castro got into a 
fight over the older man's plans to send his lover home, thus signalling
the end of their whirlwind romance.

Seabra picked up a computer monitor and bashed Castro over the head before stomping on his face and strangling him until the older man was dead.

‘This anger came from the end of a relationship with Carlos Castro,’ Rosenthal said. ‘He knew he was beating, stomping and mutilating Carlos Castro. And he knew it was wrong.’

Court papers presented by prosecutors described a statement police said Seabra gave after the January 7 death of Mr Castro while the two were on holiday in Manhattan.

The account depicted an argument in a 
hotel room that turned vicious and escalated into a prolonged hour-long 
frenzy, with Seabra first choking his companion, then stabbing him with a
corkscrew in his face and groin.

Seabra
also admitted to hitting Mr Castro on the head with a computer monitor 
and stamping on his face while wearing shoes, the papers said.

After the attack Seabra told police, he showered, put on a suit and left.

Ambitious: Castro brought Seabra out to New York where the 21-year-old was hoping to get modeling jobs through a Manhattan agency

The 21-year-old, Seabra, was a contestant in 2010 on a Portuguese television show called A Procura Do Sonho, or 'Pursuit Of A Dream', which hunts for modelling talent.

Although he did not win the show, he gained a modelling contract with an agency founded by designer Fatima Lopes, who developed the show and was a judge.

Testimony begins Wednesday, with 
Castro’s friend Wanda Perez expected to take the stand to describe the 
victim’s growing fear of his young lover in the days leading up to the 
murder.
