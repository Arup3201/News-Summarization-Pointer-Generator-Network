Police officers spent two days raiding the London home of Lord Greville Janner as part of an on-going probe into historic sex abuse claims

Police officers have raided the London home of Labour Lord Greville Janner, as part of an 'on-going criminal investigation' in to historic sex abuse allegations, it has emerged.

Officers from Leicestershire Police spent two days searching the peer's £600,000 apartment in Barnet, north London.

The force refused to give details of what was seized at the 85-year-old's home but confirmed it is part of an on-going probe.

It is understood the investigation is into allegations of historic sex abuse.

A police spokesman said: 'Leicestershire Police can confirm its officers executed a search warrant of a property in Barnet, London as part of an ongoing criminal inquiry.

'No arrests have been made at this stage.'

The former barrister was named Baron Janner of Braunstone, Leicester in 1997.

The peer's lawyers WilmerHale said in a statement, that Lord Janner is helping police officers with their inquiries.

The statement said: 'Lord Janner has not been arrested but has been assisting the police with their inquiries. We are not able to make any further comment at this time.'

Builders working on a renovation next door to Janner’s home saw a number of police cars and officers at the address on Monday and Tuesday.

One said: 'There were police cars here on Monday and Tuesday. They were coming and going all day.

'I don’t know what happened, but they’ve been back since.

'They were here on Tuesday and came back on Wednesday.'

The huge white-fronted property in West Hampstead contains six luxury flats.

Janner was at home on Thursday afternoon but did not answer the door.

A young man, who identified himself as ‘Jameson’, claimed he was the Lord’s personal spiritual healer.

He said: 'The Lord won’t come to the door. He is exhausted with all the stress of dealing with the police.

'He’s old and needs his rest. I don’t want to say any more.'

Leicestershire Police refused to comment on what was seized at Lord Janner's Barnet flat. Officers were seen combing the property on Monday and Tuesday

In 2006 Lord Janner was struck by fellow Lord Bramall, a former head of the Armed Forces, during a furious row over the Lebanon conflict.

Janner, a prominent speaker on Jewish rights who was President of the Board of British Jews, has been hailed for his efforts to see Holocaust victims receive compensation.

In 1955, he married Myra Sheink, born and bred in Australia, who passed away in 1996. He has three children and many grandchildren.

On his official website, Janner says his hobbies include 'autograph collections, glass and other antiquities, swimming, speaking his nine languages and his family.'

It also says he is a member of the Magic Circle and the International Brotherhood of Magicians.
