Adam Joseph Barney admitted 'lashing out' at the baby girl because of his frustrations over the fact she wouldn't stop crying, the dirty living conditions and her siblings misbehaving

A man has admitted killing his girlfriend's 14-month-old baby daughter by punching her with 'everything he had' in the head and stomach.

Adam Joseph Barney told investigators he was caring for Kenzie Rose La Buy when he became frustrated that she wouldn't stop crying.

The 24-year-old was living with his girlfriend and her children at the Western Colony Inn in Ogden, Utah, at the time of the incident in late August last year, according to Deseret News. 

He had been looking after the the baby girl while her mother was at work when he lost his temper and repeatedly punched her. 

Barney gave the attack 'everything he had', he reportedly told detectives who testified in the case, but also claimed he did not kill her on purpose.

According to the prosecution's case 'Barney admitted that due to his increased frustration over the dirty living conditions, the victim crying and other two children misbehaving, he lashed out at (the girl).' 

He reportedly left Kenzie lying on a bed while he cleaned up, then when he placed her in a buggy he noticed she seemed lethargic and was having trouble breathing. 

An autopsy concluded Kenzie died of blunt force trauma to the abdomen. She had for some time before Barney called 911.

He pleaded guilty in 2nd District Court on Wednesday to aggravated murder, a first-degree crime.

In exchange for the plea, prosecutors will not seek the death penalty and will recommend a sentence of 25 years to life with a possibility of parole, according to court documents.

Barney will be sentenced on May 13.

Kenzie's father, James La Buy, told reporters at a hearing last month that he would prefer to see Barney behind bars than on death row.

'I think (the death penalty) is an easy way out, to tell you the truth,' he said.
