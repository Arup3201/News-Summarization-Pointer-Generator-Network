Jail cell footage has been released showing a couple who allegedly kidnapped their toddler sons and fled to Cuba on a sailboat discussing the plot - and desperately urging each other to stay quiet.

Joshua and Sharyn Hakken, from Tampa, Florida, are seen embracing, kissing and apparently talking about what they will say about the kidnapping on the video released by prosecutors.

Among other documents released this week, prosecutors have also shared a bizarre love letter Sharyn Hakken sent to a 26-year-old woman whom she met in prison, in which she tells the former inmate she is '100% committed to you and our relationship'.

The Hakkens were charged with kidnapping, interference with child custody and neglect in April after they allegedly kidnapped two-year-old Chase and four-year-old Cole from the boys' grandparents, who had been granted custody of them just a week earlier.

After the couple were tracked down in Cuba and returned to the U.S., they were held in a Hillsborough County jail, where surveillance cameras filmed their conversations on April 10.

'Be careful what you say to your cellmates,' Joshua Hakken, 45, says to his wife. 'No one can know about this.'

'I know, I know, I know,' responds Sharyn Hakken, 34, later adding, 'I said too much on the plane', as her husband comforts her, ABC News reported.

The couple, who have both pleaded not guilty to the kidnapping charges, also apparently discussed their release from jail.

Affair: Lacrecia White, pictured, said that she met Sharyn Hakken in prison and they continue to write to each other. Prosecutors have released the letters, in which Hakken tells White she loves her

Devotion: The letters called White her 'soul mate' and tell her she is 100% committed to their relationship

As part of the documents prosecutors released this week in the Hakken case, they shared a letter written from Sharyn Hakken to a woman. The woman, Lacrecia White, told ABC Action News that they had met in prison in July before she was released. Here are some excerpts from the letter from Hakken:

'I hope I dream about you tonight. I need to see you and feel you. I love you. Ugh I so badly wish we could hold each other right now. I wanna play with your hair!

'I am so super excited about our future together...

'I want to talk to you and hear your 
voice sooo bad... So how are you my beautiful girl? I miss you so much.

'I love you so much. I hope you really do know that by now... I am 100% fully committed to you and our relationship!

'Let's get married! (I'm totally serious unless you think I'm crazy then haha jk [just kidding])'

'I've been nervous that yours and my relationship could hurt my case in some way and that my lawyer would find out and tell me to stop talking to you. I don't think I'd be able to!'

'When everything goes down I'll come 
find you,' Joshua Hakken said, with his wife adding: 'If I get out 
before you, I promise I'll wait for you.'

Prosecutors plan to present the footage as evidence at a trial later this year.

They also released photographs taken inside the Hakken's sailboat that show two child car seats, a gun and ammunition.

Other documents included love letters Sharyn Hakken sent to a 26-year-old woman.

The woman, Lacrecia White, gave an interview to ABC Action News and explained that they had hit it off while playing cards together in jail in July.

One
letter from Hakken reads: 'I want to talk to you and hear your voice 
sooo bad. So how are you my beautiful girl? I miss you so much. I'm glad
I stayed up so late writing to you last night.

'I love you so much. I hope you really do know that by now... I am 100% fully committed to you and our relationship!'

White, who has since been released on probation and is training to become an electrician, said that Hakken spends her days doing yoga and missing her children.

'I know that her overall goal is to get her kids back. She says that when she gets out of jail, she wants to start in with a case plan, if that's even possible,‚Äù said White.

'We'll definitely keep writing each other. I need her support and she needs a friend right now.'

Found: The couple's boat, 'Salty', is pictured moored at the Marina Hemingway complex in Havana on April 9, six days after the couple allegedly set sail from Florida with their sons on board

Prosecutors said the Hakkens had 
become paranoid about living in the U.S., claiming the government was 
trying to hack their computers and poison them. They had asked 11 
countries for asylum, documents show.

They
lost custody of the boys last year after police officers in Louisiana 
found them and the children in a hotel room surrounded by weapons and 
drugs.

On April 3, Joshua Hakken allegedly 
forced his way into his mother-in-law's home, tied her up and put the 
boys in his car, before setting sail for Cuba.

Officials
in Cuba learned that the parents were wanted in connection with a 
kidnapping and contacted U.S. authorities, who flew them back.

When
the boys were returned, their maternal grandparents Patricia and Bob 
Hauser revealed that the youngsters, who were not harmed, did not know 
they were allegedly kidnapped.

'They
have been told that everyone heard about their sailboat trip to Cuba - 
"another country", as they call it,' Mrs Hauser said at a press 
conference. 'And their airport ride back to America, and that everyone 
wants to take their picture... We are treating it as if they went on a 
vacation.'

Mr Hauser said that they had never imagined they would be bringing up Cole and Chase - but that the 'smart, chatty' boys were a joy each day.

'It was initially a change of life-style for us, but having these boys here is just amazing,' he said.

'I come home from work at the end of a
bad day and the two will come running up hugging and kissing me 
[saying] "Papa's home! Papa's home!" It's just wonderful. We wouldn't 
trade it for anything.'
