During a Thursday hearing, Sen. Barbara Boxer suggested that former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson was following precedent by setting up an email alias to conduct official government business. But the researcher who uncovered Jackson's 'Richard Windsor' alias account last year said Jackson's habit of hiding some of her official correspondence was both unprecedented and illegal.

The EPA's inspector general is investigating whether Jackson was attempting to shield her activities from Congress and from citizen requests under the Freedom Of Information Act. The question was raised during a hearing on the confirmation of Gina McCarthy to serve as the agency's next administrator

Former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson resigned in December, shortly before the agency started providing a Freedom Of Information Act requester with copies of emails linked to a phony 'Richard Windsor' account she used for some official business

According to a memo the EPA sent to the National Archivist in 2008, it was standard practice for top officials to have two email accounts, in part to help them distinguish between urgent communications and garden-variety emails that flooded their in-boxes every day.

Clinton administration EPA administrator Carol Browner and her successors used secondary email addresses that were related to their official identities in the EPA's computer systems.

But Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) senior fellow Chris Horner told MailOnline that Jackson, who resigned in December, broke with tradition and created an entirely new identity so that she could conduct some correspondence in secret.

'I found the memo and revealed it in my book,' Horner said, 'and then CEI sued the EPA for the "Richard Windsor" emails.'

'EPA's final document production deadline in that lawsuit is April 15th,' he explained, 'and then we'll be before a judge to argue about thousands of pages that EPA is withholding.'

'They owed us 12,000 emails, and they provided 2,000 per month when they were required to give us 3,000. We don't expect them to comply with the law any more than they have been already.'

Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer suggested that Bush-era EPA leaders also used fake email accounts, including one with the alias 'Tofu.'

Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow Chris Horner (R) uncovered EPA's history of providing its top officials with secondary email accounts. In a Senate hearing Wyoming Republican John Barrasso explained that Lisa Jackson took that practice into uncharted territory

In an attempt to diffuse what became a spirited debate with Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso, Boxer provided examples of Bush administration EPA officials who had their own secondary email addresses.

EPA chief Christine Todd Whitman,she said, used the alias 'ToWhit.' Administrator Stephen Johnson used 'ToCarter.'

Marianne Horinko, an acting administrator in 2003, had an email alias called 'ToDuke.' And Bush-era acting administrator Marcus Peacock used 'Tofu.'

'All of them have used it,' Boxer said. 'I don't think it is anything nefarious.'

Horner and Sen. Barrasso both called the argument nonsense.

Gina McCarthy, an assistant administrator with the EPA, will take the agency's top job if the Senate confirms her

Vegetarian emails? Boxer revealed that Marcus Peacock (L) once an acting EPA administrator in the George W. Bush administration, used a secondary address with the alias 'Tofu'

'The claim that "everybody does it" is utterly unfounded,' Horner told MailOnline, 'and no one has provided any support for that claim.'

'Jackson created a second identity for the purpose of conducting some official communications, and that's both unprecedented and a violation of the Federal Records Act.'

The EPA has said it followed a policy requiring the disclosure that 'Richard Windsor' was an alias for Lisa Jackson. Barrasso said in the hearing Thursday that he had obtained copies of emails between 'Windsor' and Gina McCarthy that provided no information about Windsor's true identity.

'The email alias "Richard Windsor" does not comply with the rules,' Barrasso said during Thursday's hearing.

'I wonder if anyone at the EPA objected,' he asked McCarthy, 'or if you personally objected to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson using an alias that was absolutely against the policy of the EPA? And your emails back to her go back to 2009.'

'I think it’s important for all of us to know if the EPA and this administration is going to be transparent,' he continued, 'or is intentionally deciding to try to deceive the American people.'

EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman (L) used the email alias was 
'ToWhit' and acting administrator Marianne Horinko (R) used 'ToDuke.' 
Their accounts, unlike recently-resigned administrator Lisa Jackson's, 
were linked to their actual identities

Bush-era EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson (L) used 'ToCarter' as his secondary email name. Bob Perciasepe (R) was an assistant EPA administrator in the Clinton administration, and is now acting administrator under Obama. Sen. Boxer did not say what his alias was in the 1990s, or if he uses one now

Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter cracked a joke about 'Windsor,' calling it 'pretty monarchist.'

'Now,
 a lot of folks would say that is appropriate for EPA, he quipped, 'but I
 personally vote for tofu. I think that is more on the mark' for an 
agency known for embracing liberal politics.

'I'm a meat-eater myself,' McCarthy replied, to chuckles from the gallery.

Horner first exposed the practice of EPA leaders obscuring their official communication through fake email aliases, in his 2012 book The Liberal War On Transparency.

To date, no evidence has emerged that other federal agencies have similar policies.

The EPA wrote in its 2008 memo to the National Archivist that the secondary email accounts up to that time were all intact or suffered 'minimal' archiving losses. It's unclear how much of Lisa Jackson's 'Richard Windsor' account has been deleted, since the agency hasn't yet complied with Horner's FOIA request in full.

EPA also wrote that Browner, the first administrator given the option of a secondary email account, 'reportedly' never made use of hers.

Horner said he's skeptical of that, calling it in a 2012 op-ed 'simply an assertion, one EPA elected not to check.'

A spokesperson for Sen. Boxer referred an email from MailOnline to Environment & Public Works committee staff, who declined to speak on the record for this story.

In this 2008 letter to the National Archivist, the EPA acknowledged that it had been providing officials with extra email accounts, and that some of the emails in those accounts had been deleted
