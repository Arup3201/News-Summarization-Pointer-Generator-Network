An English student has been forced to drop out of university because she has a potentially deadly allergy to books.

Kirsty Ashman’s severe allergies meant that grubby student accommodation and dusty lecture halls and could have killed her.

The 22-year-old ended up in hospital after trying to study in the library because dusty books triggered a severe asthma attack.

Kirsty Ashman, 22, had to drop out of two universities after suffering more than 15 severe asthma attacks in less than two years and being repeatedly hospitalised

And after trying to study at two universities, Ms Ashman has been forced to give up her dream of becoming an English teacher.

Ms Ashman, from Haverhill, Suffolk, said: ‘I was desperate to get a degree and finish my studies, but I had to put my health first.

‘My allergies grew so bad that I lived in fear of libraries and common rooms as even a small inhalation of dust could bring on an asthma attack which would completely shut down my airways.

‘I tried to stay away from areas which could bring on an attack, but there’s so many aspects at uni I couldn’t control all of them.

‘The library and the common rooms were always dusty, the books triggered my allergies and I had to get my friends to get my books from the shelves.

‘I am determined to become a teacher, so I’m studying at home from the Open University - but there’s no way I can study English, there are too many dusty books.’

Ms Ashman is allergic to dust, pollen, mould, grass and some animals. When she was at university, she had a severe asthma attack after opening a dusty book in a library and had to be hospitalised

Ms Ashman first attended Queen Mary’s University in London but lasted only a term as her continual allergy-related health problems meant she spent more time in the hospital than in her halls.

She then decided to commute from home to attend Anglia Ruskin University, in Cambridge, where she survived for nearly a year before a series of attacks meant she was forced to drop out.

In two years at university Ms Ashman suffered more than 15 life-threatening asthma attacks brought on by dust, grass, pollens, animals and mould.

She said: ‘The toilets and the canteen were always dangerous because the cleaning products could bring on an attack and mean another visit to hospital.’

Ms Ashman suffered from hay fever as a child but her more severe symptoms began at the age of 18 when a chest infection heightened her allergic reactions.

When she is at home, Ms Ashman and her family have to vacuum and dust daily, change the hypoallergenic sheets every day and never open the windows during summer for fear of letting in pollen

She said: ‘It’s really hard, I have to battle so much just to achieve normal things.

‘One day I was studying, I’d got my friends to get the books off the shelves in the library as that is normally a danger area for me.

‘As I got the book out of my bag and opened it, it must have wafted a cloud of dust into my face because I felt my airways closing and was struggling to breathe.

‘It was a terrible reaction and I ended up back in hospital.’

Ms Ashman now studies medical sciences with the Open University from the safety of her own home where she and her family have to stick to a strict cleaning regime.

They have to dust and vacuum the house every day and also change the special hypoallergenic bed sheets daily.

They are unable to open the windows in summer because of the risk of pollen entering the building and they have an air filter to clean dust particles from the air.

Ms Ashman feels she has missed out on the benefits of a real university experience.

Ms Ashman had to give up her dream of remaining at university but she is now doing a degree from home through the Open University

She said: ‘Older, dustier books trigger my allergies so fewer, newer books definitely minimises the risks.

‘I’ve
 not changed my aspirations completely, I still want to be a teacher but
 it definitely made me reconsider which subject I taught.

‘My allergies have such a big impact on my life it’s inevitable that they would influence my choices for the future.

‘All my friends have been to university, moved away from home and had an amazing time.

‘They’ve finished their degrees and have already got jobs and I feel left behind.

‘I would love to live away from home but it’s just not practical for me.’
