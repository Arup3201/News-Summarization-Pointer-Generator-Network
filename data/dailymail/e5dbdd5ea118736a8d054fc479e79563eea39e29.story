Two men charged in the depraved gang rape of a 13-year-old runaway Texas girl have been placed on immigration detainers because they are illegal immigrants.

Mexicans Juan Lozano Ortega, 25, and Edgar 
Gerardo Guzman Perez, 26, were charged last Wednesday with aggravated 
sexual assault of a child.

They are accused of being part of a gang of as many as 10 men who raped their victim on June 29, while the others allegedly filmed the attacks with cellphone cameras.

'All of the other males took turns 
having sex with victim against her will, which lasted through the early 
morning hours,' according to an arrest affidavit.

The incident took place after the young 
girl ran away from an Austin, Texas, group home for children and got 
into a car with three unknown men, the affidavit states.

A third man, Donald Ray Lewis, 49, has now been arrested in connection with the incident, reports FoxNews.

Lewis is accused of assaulting the girl in a separate attack hours later, according to an arrest affidavit.

Investigators said the girl left the apartment where the initial gang rape took place and went to ‘smoke crack’ with a woman she just met at another nearby apartment on June 30.

Lewis met the unidentified victim at that apartment, the affidavit said.

The victim stayed at the second apartment for four days where she endured other assaults before leaving on July 2.

Doctors who examined the girl told investigators that their findings were consistent with her allegations.

The unidentified teen is currently in the care of the Texas 
Department of Family Protective Services.

Investigators found Ortega and Perez because one of them let the girl borrow their cellphone after dropping her off in a neighborhood and telling her to 'find somewhere to go', according to the court documents. 

The victim called her foster brother, who refused to come pick her up, but his caller ID captured the number of the suspect's phone.

U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials lodged immigration 
detainers against Ortega and Perez on July 18 following their arrests by
the Travis County Sheriff’s Office.

They remain held on $30,000 bond in Travis County Jail. Both are due back in court on Aug. 15.

An
immigration detainer is a notice that means ICE intends to assume 
custody of individuals believed to be illegally residing in the country.

State child welfare investigators are also investigating the Settlement Home for Children, where the girl lived. The center reported the girl missing on June 30.
