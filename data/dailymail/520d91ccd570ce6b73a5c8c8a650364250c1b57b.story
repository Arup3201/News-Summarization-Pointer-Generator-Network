A mother who set herself the task of visiting every Red Lion pub in the UK has just reached a huge milestone - by drinking in number 500.

Personal trainer Cathy Price, 55, from Preston in Lancashire, has spent almost four years trekking across the country to visit the pub with the most common name in Britain.

Miss Price still has 120 pubs left to sup at before finally completing her quest to drink in all of the Red Lion pubs in the UK.

Pub crawl: Cathy Price from Preston, Lancashire, has spent four years visiting Red Lion pubs across Britain. Here she is pictured at the Red Lion in Wellow, Hampshire

So far she has travelled a staggering 33,000 miles in her car, picking up just one speeding ticket and one note for bad parking.

Her ambitious hunt has set her back more than £12,000 but the mother said the journey has been 'completely worth it'.

Miss Price started the adventure after noticing a sign in a Red Lion pub in the Lake District which said it was the most common pub name in Britain.

Epic journey: So far she has travelled 33,000 miles to visit Red Lion pubs across the UK, including this one in Bitterne, Southampton

She then made a huge list of all 620 pubs with that name in the UK and started crossing them off one by one.

The personal trainer said: 'I was drinking in the Red Lion in Hawkshead and saw a plaque saying it is the most common pub name.

'I immediately imagined hundreds of them dotted all over the country and came up with a crazy idea of visiting all of them.

'My friends and family thought I was crazy at first but now they travel with me and some of friends have been to 60 Red Lions.'

And Miss Price has just visited the Red Lion in Dagnall, Bucks, to take her tally to 500.

But she still has around 120 to go before she has completed her quest.

At every pub she visits Cathy poses for a photograph and usually downs her favourite tipple - a half pint of ale, meaning she has now drunk 250 pints.

But she still has to visit the Red Lion pub in Gatwick Airport - and is prepared to buy herself a plane ticket to cross that one off the list.

All pints covered: Her pub pilgrimage means she has travelled to drinking establishments as far apart as Aberdeen in the north to Penzance in the south-west. Here she is enjoying a stop-off in Builth Wells, Powys

She added: 'It was a great feeling reaching this milestone and I only have around 120 to go.

'There are around 620 Red Lions in the UK but some are closing down so I have to be quick.

'I'm trying to finish on Grand National day next year - on the fourth anniversary of me starting my quest.

'I have finished Devon, Cornwall and London, but I still have a lot to visit in Kent and Oxford.

One for the album: Time for a snap outside a Red Lion in London. The personal trainer says she still has a lot of public houses to visit in the south of England

'I've still got to go to the Red Lion at Gatwick Airport. Hopefully they'll let me pop in for a drink, otherwise I'll have to buy a plane ticket!'

She has also collected a huge array of souvenirs including beer mats, glasses, pub t-shirts and menus.

If the pub has its own accommodation, Cathy often stays the night with her friends and family to get the 'complete experience'.

She has visited all of the Red Lion pubs which are north of her hometown of Preston, Lancashire, but still has a lot to visit in the south of England.

And by the time Cathy eventually finishes her pub pilgrimage she will have visited pubs as far apart as Aberdeen in the north to Penzance in the south-west.

She added: 'It has given me a great excuse to travel and has improved my geography - the journey has been completely worth it. 

One for the road: At every pub she visits Miss Price enjoys half a pint of ale, and she also poses for a photograph - as she did here in Mumby, Lincolnshire

Just passing through: Farnsfield, Notts, and Moore, Cheshire (right) are two more inns to be ticked off

Believe it or not, it's time for another refreshing real ale - on this occasion it's Ripley in Derbyshire

'I have travelled 33,000 miles on my adventure but I still have a long way to go.

'I have one drink in each pub I visit and I probably spend on average 25 pounds visiting each Red Lion, including travel, food and accommodation.

'The majority of Red Lion pubs are within a hundred metres of an old church and they are usually on a High Street, Market Place and Main Street.

Simply red: It's a thumbs-up after an enjoyable visit to the Red Lion in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire

'It's a great way of meeting new people and everyone is very supportive and interested to learn what I'm doing.

'The journey has been amazing because I have visited hundreds of towns and villages I would have usually just ignored.'

Her favourite pubs have been in Whitley Bay, near Newcastle, Freshwater on the Isle of Wight and one in West Bromwich, near Birmingham.

The popularity of the name dates from 1603, when King James I ordered red lions to be shown on buildings

Cathy has even visited nine Red Lion pubs abroad - in Dubai, New York, France, Rhodes, Madeira and four in Australia.

She added: 'My friends and I sometimes turn our visits into a holiday or day trip, stopping over for the night if they have nice accommodation.

'Thankfully, I can enjoy the drinks and lunch knowing my work keeps me active and will burn off the calories. I don't have a beer belly.'

Only 120 left to go: The traveller enjoys a brief rest at Wooburn Green, Buckinghamshire, as she reaches the impressive milestone of 500 pubs visited out of 620 Red Lions in Britain

The Red Lion is the most common pub name in the country, with a history dating back to King James I in 1603.

When he came to the throne in 1603 he ordered all public buildings to display a heraldic red lion in a prominent place.

The nearest pub to Downing Street is called the Red Lion and is a popular haunt for MPs.
