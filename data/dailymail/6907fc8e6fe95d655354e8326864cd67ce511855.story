MailOnline Sport is delighted to announce an exciting new partnership with Cage Warriors, Europe's biggest mixed martial arts organisation.

Having already hosted 11 successful events in 2014 in venues from London and Dublin to Amman in Jordan and Ballerup in Denmark, Cage Warriors returns to Newcastle on Saturday.

And we will be streaming the action LIVE as well as bringing you all the build-up, reaction and a highlights package.

Two weeks later, we will bring you the same unrivalled coverage from Cage Warriors 74 in London when Nicolas Dalby takes on Mohsen Bahari at the Copper Box Arena.

The company's CEO Graham Boylan said: 'I’ve always been impressed by the Daily Mail’s digital content and wide reach, so I’m very pleased that we’ll now be working alongside them and I’m sure our relationship will be extremely successful for both parties.

'We are trialling this partnership for now in order to make our own content and broadcasts even more accessible to our existing fans, as well as showing the newer generation of fans exactly what makes MMA the most exciting sport in the world.'

Cage Warriors are responsible for launching the career of Michael Bisping (pictured)

Founded in 2002, Cage Warriors has been responsible for launching the careers of Michael Bisping, Dan Hardy and most recently Conor McGregor.

The Dubliner was a two-weight champion before moving to the UFC and winning his first four fights to stand on the verge of a world title shot.

Among the fighters bidding to stamp their own authority on the sport include Stevie Ray and Curt Warburton who fight for the third time at Cage Warriors 73 at the Metro Radio Arena.

Scotsman Ray defends the lightweight title he won when he won a split decision against Warburton in London last June in their rematch.

Warburton won the pair's first contest by unanimous decision in March 2013.

Ray insists he has no concerns about travelling to Warburton's backyard.

'I’m looking forward to defending my belt, particularly in Curt’s hometown,' he said. 'It’s not too far from home for me either, so you can expect an invasion of Scottish fans and a crazy atmosphere.' 

Warburton previously fought in the UFC but departed following his defeat to Joe Lauzon three years ago.

He said: 'The judges won’t save Stevie Ray this time. I’m going to put things right in Newcastle.'
