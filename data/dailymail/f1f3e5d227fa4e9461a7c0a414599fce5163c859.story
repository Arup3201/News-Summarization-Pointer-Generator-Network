A pioneering eco-bike made from kitchen worktops can charge devices such as iPhones, cameras and - in theory - electric cars.

The Levitation bike is connected to devices using a USB port hidden in the handlebars and stores the energy produced through pedal power.

It features a touchscreen monitor that shows how much 
electricity has been generated, as well as the rider’s heart rate, plus the bike doubles up as a Wi-Fi hotspot.

The eco-friendly Levitation bike, pictured, from U.S firm Dezien is made from the same material used in kitchen workshops and has a USB port hidden in the handlebars. As the pedals turn, energy is stored in a built-in battery that is then used to charge mobile devices and even electric cars

The Levitation bike is the brainchild of architect Michael Strain and designers Ramerio Diaz and Brandon Hartley. They built the zero-carbon device to reduce the emissions produced during commutes. They said: 'It has most of the same parts that a typical bicycle has except its use now becomes greater than just cycling for fun or fitness'

This world-first human-powered flying bike was announced last month.

Comprising a mix of a bike with wings, a fan, a motor and a parachute, the invention - known as a Paravelo - can reach 4,000ft and speeds of up to 25mph.

On the ground, the Paravelo is an ordinary two-wheeled bike fitted with a trailer and a large biofuel-powered fan.

With a bit of space to act as a runway, the trailer can be docked with the bike to transform it into a flying machine capable of running for three hours on a full tank of fuel.

The Levitation bike is the brainchild of designers Michael Strain, Ramerio Diaz and Brandon Hartley who work under the name Dezien.

It has an built-in battery which is charged as the bike is ridden.

The energy harvested in the battery from the pedal power can then be used to charge mobile devices connected to a USB port hidden in the bike's handlebars.

The generators will continue to store energy as the bike is ridden and at the end of a cycle, the bike can be plugged into a wall socket and offloads any spare power back into the grid.

The Levitation's bizarre triangular frame is made from solid surface material HI-MACS - a cross between acrylic and stone, most commonly used for kitchen work surfaces.

The bike also has an integrated Wi-Fi hotspot built-in that can be used to wirelessly connect your devices to the internet.

Dezien's concept Levitation bike was entered into the 2013 HI-MACS Annual Design Contest in April. This diagram shows off the main features of the bike including an LED touchscreen monitor that shows the battery charge and the rider's heart rate

Other features include an touchscreen LED display that shows the battery's charge level, as well as  front and rear lighting built into the frame of the bike.

A spokesman for Dezien, based in Texas said: 'The concept of the Levitation project is that cycling on the community scale can produce clean, healthy, sustainable energy.

'This is achieved by an on-board generator and high capacity batteries that store the energy you create during the act of cycling.

'When you get to where you are going, Levitation has a ‘drain plug’ system that allows you to plug your energy back into the grid.

'Individually, Levitation is great for powering your mobile devices with free energy on the go.

'On the community scale, the benefits of Levitation are exponential, from less carbon emissions during commutes, to healthy living, to producing free zero-carbon energy.

'It has most of the same parts that a typical bicycle has except its use now becomes greater than just cycling for fun or fitness.

'Dezien is calling for engineers, manufacturers and entrepreneurs to step up and make this concept a reality.'

It was entered into the 2013 HI-MACS 
Annual Design Contest in April.

The contest calls for object or installation designs that
 can be made from HI-MAC Solid Surface material.
