Samuel Eto’o rolled back the years to spare the blushes of his Everton captain Phil Jagielka in Russia on Thursday night.

Eto’o, a Champions League winner with Barcelona and Inter Milan and one of the greatest strikers of his generation, can’t run around like he used to but at 33 he still has the instinct and sense of timing of a genuine star.

With eight minutes left and Everton lucky to be only one behind against lively Russian opponents, Leighton Baines fired in a cross from the right having stayed up from taking a corner. Until that moment, Krasnodar had dealt with Everton’s threat but this time Eto’o ghosted ahead of their back line and finished with a left-foot volley from close range that typified composure and class.

Manager Roberto Martinez had given Eto’o a rare start partly because of past experience playing in the Russian League for Anzhi — and he felt the decision paid off.

‘Sometimes, you know what to expect when you’ve played in a certain country. Samuel knew the way the game is played in Russia, you have to wait for certain moments. I thought he was very composed and was waiting for that moment when an opportunity came. The finish was of the highest quality.’

‘I was surprised how well Krasnodar played. I knew they were good but they kept their energy levels high for an hour. For us, the pleasing thing is how hard we had to work to get the result, which we did.

‘We didn’t have enough attacking play to see how good our strikers were but Samuel has great experience in European football and if anyone was going to score, it was him.’

Although second-best on Thursday night, Everton are now well-placed to qualify for the knockout stages of the Europa League, having beaten Wolfsburg 4-1 in their opening group game.

Martinez picked a strong side to please the 400 Everton fans who had made a 4,800-mile round trip to southern Russia.

But Krasnodar were quicker and hungrier in the first hour with Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard having to make fine saves from Marat Izmailov and Artur Jedrzejczyk.

Howard’s luck ran out after 43 minutes though the goal was self-inflicted from an Everton point of view.

Odil Ahmedov clipped a pass over Jagielka’s head towards Mauricio Pereyra and when the Everton skipper tried to hook the ball away he knocked it straight to Brazilian forward Ari, who took advantage of the gift with a cracking finish from 18 yards.

It marked a sudden downturn in Jagielka’s fortunes after his spectacular injury-time equaliser against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby on Saturday.

Martinez responded quickly and threw on £28million record signing Romelu Lukaku at the interval for Christian Atsu.

‘Romelu gave us a focal point,’ admitted the Everton boss, though his side nearly went 2-0 down after 64 minutes when Krasnodar substitute Wanderson went round three defenders, including Jagielka, before hitting the crossbar.

It looked gloomy for Everton but you can never write off a team that has Eto’o up front.

Although his link-up play with Lukaku was non-existent, the Cameroon striker is still a great fox-in-the-box and when Baines got his delivery right, he needed no second invitation. It was probably more than the Merseysiders deserved — but Lukaku even had a chance for a late winner, his header lacking the power to beat Andriy Dykan.

Their thoughts now turn to the Premier League where they travel to Manchester United on Sunday. And Martinez must hope James McCarthy, Steven Pienaar and Seamus Coleman, all injured for the trip to Russia, are fit enough to play a part.

Aiden McGeady, who used to play with Krasnodar goalscorer Ari at Spartak Moscow, admitted: ‘They have strengthened since I left Russia and looked a good team.

‘It is never easy to come here, after a four-and-a-half-hour flight, legs were heavy. But not having ideal preparation is part of European football and we have four points.’

One pleasing aspect for everyone was that there was no discernible racial behaviour from Krasnodar fans towards Eto’o and Atsu following recent high-profile cases in Russia which have seen Yaya Toure and Christopher Samba abused.

Indeed, most of the jeering from Krasnodar fans fell to McGeady because of his Spartak connections.
