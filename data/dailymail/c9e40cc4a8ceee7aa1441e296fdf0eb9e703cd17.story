'I'm from a part of Holland which historically speaking probably shouldn't be Dutch at all. 

'My home town of Maastricht - in a corner of the Netherlands near where it borders Belgium and Germany - strikes me as being much more Belgian in character than Dutch, in that fun-loving, hedonistic and unrestrained.

'Throughout history, lots of countries have fought to take possession of Maastricht. The French King Louis XIV always seemed to be sending his army to seize it. It was very important to him.

Master musician: Dutch composer Andre Rieu may travel the world, but he insists he prefers Maastricht

Andre's home town may be in the Netherlands, but it borders Belgium and Germany. Pictured: the Meuse River

'One of the town's claims to fame is that the real-life musketeer D'Artagnan - the hero of Alexandre Dumas's book The Three Musketeers - died fighting for the French in a siege of Maastricht and there is a statue of him in Aldenhof Park. 

'The statue carries the Musketeers' famous motto: 'All for one, one for all.' That's a philosophy I like - democratic.

'According to legend, D'Artagnan ate his last breakfast in the kitchen of the castle in Maastricht where I live.

'It is often said that Maastricht people have a Burgundy way of life: we like to drink wine, eat good food and relax.

'We also are a very cosmopolitan bunch. In addition to Dutch, we all speak French and German, and as there is a university here, English is also widely spoken.

'People are always surprised when I tell them that Belgium lies just 200 yards from my house and that this is the most northern part of the Continent where French is spoken.

'As founder of the Johann Strauss Orchestra, my love of the waltz is well known. But my passion for it really stems from the music rather than the city of Vienna, which I visited relatively late in life.

'My introduction to the waltz came when a cafe orchestra needed a replacement violinist and asked me if I was interested in joining. I went to the rehearsal and that was the very first time I played a waltz - it was the Gold and Silver by Franz Lehar. I'm going to Sao Paulo soon, and I'm going to play that waltz again. 

Andre has played in Vienna, but reveals that he did not first visit the musical city until later in life

'The waltzes by Lehar are warmer than those by Johann Strauss. Strauss was more intellectual - by that, I mean he was a genius. Like most of his great musical contemporaries, he was universally admired - Johannes Brahms, for example, said he would have given anything to have written the Blue Danube. 

'For me, Strauss is the composer of the waltz. I've composed some waltzes myself, but it's difficult to make them as good as his.

'The Austrians are not keen on being described as a reincarnation of Strauss. We were once performing in Tokyo, and a few of us were in the hotel bar having a drink. In the same bar were musicians from the Vienna Philharmonic. We were talking and drinking, and after several beers one of them said: ‘It’s not possible that you can play a waltz as it should be played because only we Austrians can play the waltz!’

'I think that’s nonsense because I’m a musician. Even if I were an Eskimo, it would make no difference. When you’re a good musician, you are able to play any kind of music.

'When I finally went to Austria, I performed my first waltz in the wonderful Wiener Musikverein in Vienna. Afterwards, I heard there was a riot in the city because they wanted to know who allowed me to play there. However, I now go back to Vienna every year – it has become a tradition.

One of Andre's biggest professional accomplishments? Playing New York City's Radio City Music Hall

Centre stage: He also fondly remembers the thrill of taking the stage at London's Royal Albert Hall

'People are often warning me about the perils of playing in certain places. For example, someone once said: Watch out when you play in New York, the audiences are spoilt.’ But when I actually perform in these cities, the audiences are all so warmhearted and they want to enjoy themselves.

'My greatest performing thrill was probably when I first took the stage at London’s Royal Albert Hall – anybody who is anybody has played there. And I’ll never forget the joy of playing at New York’s Radio City Music Hall or the Musikverein. I’ve been very fortunate. One place I haven’t played but would love to is on the Moon. Sir Richard Branson tells me he is going to build a hotel there and has asked if I want to be the first to play in it.

All in the family: Andre's father began his career as a conductor of the Leipzig Opera in East Germany

'Music runs in my family. My father, Andre senior, was a conductor of the Leipzig Opera in East Germany, before working in Maastricht with the Limburg Symphony Orchestra. Once he dressed the whole orchestra in Mozart costumes and had them driven through the town in a horsedrawn carriage. I was so impressed. I think I have probably inherited a little bit of his crazy gene.

'I travel for my work, so for pleasure I like to stay at home. My wife and I do, however, spend a couple of days each year at the Belgian coast with the grandchildren. If we decide to venture further afield, we like to go to Rome or Venice.

'I adore Venice so much that my new show is titled Love In Venice. Love and Venice go together so well.

'I adore Venice so much that my new show is titled Love in Venice,' he says

'I haven’t yet performed there, but some of my favourite concerts have been elsewhere in Italy. I did a TV special in Cortona, a wonderful old town in Tuscany. It was fantastic. 

I don’t really have any appetite for luxurious holidays. I’ve been to Monte Carlo three times – two of those occasions were to receive the World Music Award – but I have to say I’m always glad to return to Maastricht. I’m famous and I sell a lot of records, but home is where my heart is.

'I keep busy when I’m at home. Like most of the Netherlands, Maastricht is a great place to cycle, although I’ll never exhaust myself climbing its hills. The highest point in the town is 1,300 ft above sea level, prompting some to jokingly call it the Dutch Alps.

'I’ve discovered on my travels that an awful lot of people don’t really know very much about my country. I can go to America and people will say to me: ‘Holland? Is that in Denmark?’ They don’t know where it is.

'I tell everybody that I live in a beautiful country, because I really do love it. I’ve travelled the whole world and I’m very glad I live in Holland. 

Each summer, Maastricht hosts an open-air concert in the main square with crowds of up to 12,000 each night

'One of the highlights of my year is the annual summer open-air concert in the main square in Maastricht. This year, for our tenth anniversary, we played eight shows. Every night we were performing to 12,000 people. It’s great for Maastricht because the hotels and restaurants do such good business.

'And in the run-up to Christmas, our big concert series takes place in the UK and Ireland. This year there will be shows in Belfast, Dublin, Nottingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle, Birmingham, London, Manchester and Glasgow. I’m shortly launching a campaign to encourage everybody to learn how to waltz. Anyone who has been to my concerts knows that people love to get up and waltz in the aisles. 

'Perhaps at this year’s concerts there will be even more people joining in – they’re a great way to get into the Christmas spirit.'
