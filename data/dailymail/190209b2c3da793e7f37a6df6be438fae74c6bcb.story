A former Crimewatch presenter has told a court that Rolf Harris should not be accused of lying after forgetting a game show appearance in the 1970s because she cannot recall being in the programme either.

Sue Cook, 65, who appeared in the Star Games series a couple of times, said celebrities were ‘bussed in’ to a recreation area and the city or town was ‘immaterial’.

The writer and broadcaster took to Twitter on Monday after seeing coverage of Harris’s indecent assault trial on Sky News.

Harris, 84, of Bray, Berkshire, had previously told the jury at London's Southwark Crown Court that he had never been to Cambridge until four years ago, but it later emerged that he had appeared in a Star Games show in the city in 1978.

One alleged victim claimed that the entertainer had grabbed her bottom when she was waitressing at an event there in 1975, although prosecutors say she may have got the date wrong.

Ms Cook said: ‘I said to my husband “Gosh, that’s not fair - I wouldn’t have remembered it was Cambridge either”.

‘I don’t think he can be accused of lying because I can’t remember it. I was a participant in that game show but I wouldn’t have known it was Cambridge either.’

She said she did not remember Harris having been in the same episode as her, and told the jury that, during her four decades in broadcasting, she had forgotten ‘loads’ of events she had been to.

The BBC Radio 4 presenter said that, on one occasion, her mother-in-law gave her a DVD of an event at the Royal Opera House, and she assumed she had confused her with Sue Lawley.

She told the court: ‘To my amazement it was me hosting a gala event at the Royal Opera House.

‘I have no memory whatsoever of doing it.’

Harris had previously told the jury that he had never been to Cambridge until four years ago, but pictures later emerged (above) showing he had appeared in a Star Games show in the city in 1978

In cross-examination by Sasha Wass QC, she admitted that she would not ‘swear blind’ under oath that she had not been somewhere for work.

Ms Cook said she had appeared on the show three times, in episodes filmed in May 1979.

Harris is standing trial for 12 counts of indecent assault on four women between 1968 and 1986, all of which he denies.

Count 1: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on girl aged 15

Count 2: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15

Count 3: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15

Count 4: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15

Count 5: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15

Count 6: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15

Count 7: Indecent assault between 1/1/84 and 1/1/85 on same girl, then aged 19

Count 8: Indecent assault on 31/5/86 on second girl, aged 14

Count 9: Indecent assault on same girl, 14

Count 10: Indecent assault on 31/5/86 on same girl, 14

Count 11: Indecent assault between 1/1/68 and 1/1/70 on third girl, aged 7-8

Count 12: Indecent assault on fourth girl, 14, between 1/1/75 and 1/1/76

The former television presenter denies all the counts

Earlier, the court heard from Harris’s former tour manager, Ken Jeacle, who said women fans would ‘rush up’ to the performer and put their arms around him.

He would have to ‘extract’ the star from those situations to avoid fans getting too close, the court heard.

Speaking via video-link from Australia, Mr Jeacle said: ‘Rolf Harris, as I observed, was a gentleman who was a very affectionate, warm, outgoing personality. His tendency to be demonstrative with outward affection is constant.

‘He has absolutely no problem whatsoever with giving somebody a warm embrace, he’s done it to me a million times.

‘His behaviour to other people has always been as a gentleman, as somebody whom I have been proud to be in the company of, and never at any time have I even perceived any sort of attitude or behaviour of any type which could be in any way questionable.’

He said that in the 1990s Harris told him ‘he didn’t feel as free and as joyful’ performing on stage, and he and his wife Alwen had both been ill, so his tours of South East Asia and Australia ended, with an 11-date reprisal in 2008 at Sydney Opera House.

In cross-examination, he said claims that Harris had two extra-marital affairs were not his business.

‘Not only can I not speak (about it), I will not speak of that because it’s none of my concern what Rolf Harris’s private life was. I never even asked about it.’

Harris is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four women between 1968 and 1986, all of which he denies.

The trial continues.
