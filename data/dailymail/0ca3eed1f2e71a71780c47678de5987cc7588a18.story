A former governor's daughter has detailed her journey from being his secret love child to being welcomed into his family after launching a law suit against him to make him pay for her college fees.

Kara Sundlun, a WFSB news anchor, is the daughter of Bruce Sundlun, the late former Rhode Island governor and wealthy businessman.

In the mid-1970s, Sundlun had an affair with Kara's mother Judith Hewes while she was working as a flight attendant for an Ohio-based charter airline that he operated.

Kara was conceived in October 1974, three months into Sundlun's third marriage.

She was raised by her mother and later took her mother's husband's name so was Kara Hewes for the first two decades of her life.

But in her later teen years she decided to make contact with her famous father who was a decorated World War II bomber pilot and made millions of dollars as a business magnate. 

'He saw me as a baby once, but it wasn't until I was a teenager and saw him on television that I tried to reach out to him, to meet him,' she told Courant.

'I finally met him when I was 17 after my mom hired an attorney, and in 1992 I finally met him.

'The fact that my father was successful and all of that was great but it is not what I was looking for. 

'I yearned for a figure of stability and inside, I needed to know who the other half of me was. 

Sundlun served two terms as governor from 1991 to 1995.

It was in 1993, during his second term in office, Sundlun, then 73, was sued by Kara - the story made headlines across the country.

Just before her 18th birthday, she filed a paternity suit against Sundlin, asserting that he was her biological father and therefore needed to pay her college tuition fees.

The pair met and he reportedly said: 'She's 17, and I'm 73, but for three hours we got along pretty well, I thought.'

But the governor said he was absolved of any legal responsibility because the girl had an adoptive father, People magazine reported at the time.  

In 2003 Sundlun walked Kara down the aisle for her marriage to WFSB anchor Dennis House in Newport (both pictured)

Kara now has three half brothers who are his sons from his first marriage. Pictured: Kara with her brother Stuart

The magazine reported Kara said: 'My mother has supported me my whole life, so he should help out with my college education.'

'He should want to help his daughter get off on the right foot.' 

Eventually they reached an out of court settlement and under its terms, he acknowledged Kara as his daughter and agreed to pay her college tuition. 

Kara has now written a book detailing her experience

Speaking of their reconciliation Kara told Courant: 'He didn't ever say 'I'm sorry' in a maudlin way. 

'Once I spent that first summer with him in Newport and we began to build a relationship, he would call several times a day. 

'After I said "I love you" to him when we were finishing a phone call or saying goodbye, he started to say it. I remember I didn't care so much about things he could give me, but wanted a relationship he backed up with actions. 

She credits her relationship with her father for helping her pick her husband and following her career - she received counselling after a teenage suicide attempt. 

In 2003 Sundlun walked Kara down the aisle for her marriage to WFSB anchor Dennis House in Newport.

'At the wedding reception he made it right with my mom by giving her all the credit for raising me. It was definitely an acknowledgment of her. 

'And the first time I celebrated a Father's Day with him and gave him a gift. That was a very special moment.'

Kara and her husband now have two children and she says her father, who died in 2011, being 'concerned when I had my miscarriage, having him come to my daughter's first birthday' were key moments for her. 

His first four marriages - to Madeleine Schiffer Eisner, Pamela Soldwedel Barrett, Joyanne Carter and Marjorie Lee - ended in divorce.

Kara now has three half brothers who are Sundlun's sons from his first marriage. 

She has now published a book detailing her experience.
