A Pennsylvania man is facing animal abuse and drug charges after police say he tormented his pet kitten and injected him with heroin, prompting a quick-thinking veterinarian to use a human overdose medication on the cat.

The 8-week-old, 2-pound black cat was rushed on Sunday to Hope Veterinary Specialists clinic in Malvern Sunday bleeding from his face, missing several teeth and with a rope tightly tied around his neck.

A doctor at the center determined that the animal had been exposed to heroin and decided to administer an unusual remedy, giving the kitty the drug Narcan commonly used to treat human victims of drug overdose.

Police in West Whiteland Township say at around 4.40am Sunday, an officer spotted James Myers' car parked in the middle of Dunwoody Drive with the driver's door ajar, according to a press release put out Tuesday by the Chester County District Attorney's Office.

The officer says under the door he saw an injured black kitten with a rope around its neck and several teeth knocked out.

Myers allegedly tried to choke his pet, slammed his face into the ground and then painted the message 'SLAM IT YOU PU$$Y' on the pavement.

'This is a two pound kitten that would fit in the palm of my hand. He would take a kitten, a defenseless kitten, and torture it this way,' District Attorney Tom Hogan told the station 6ABC.

Police say they also seized nearly two dozen bundles of heroin, hundreds of used baggies and 46 of needles in the 24-year-old's car.

Authorities say at the veterinary clinic, Dr. Jennifer Magilto was able to revive the injured cat with an antidote for opium-based drug overdoses.

Initially, there was talk of euthanizing the animal because of his injuries, but when the veterinarian learned the facts of the case, she concluded that the kitten must have been injected with heroin and decided to try and save him.

Within 24 hours, the kitty, appropriately named Hope after the veterinary clinic, was purring, eating with appetite and playing.

The tough little guy is expected to make a full recovery, according to the doctors. He will then be transferred to the Chester County SPCA, which will help find Hope a foster home before putting him up for adoption.

James Myers has been charged with animal cruelty and drug possession. He is being held in jail on $25,000 bail.

‘The abuse of this kitten was a singularly depraved act,’ stated District Attorney Hogan. ‘Heroin addicts abuse themselves, animals, and children without remorse or regret. What punishment is severe enough for this type of evil?’
