Brendan Rodgers gambled by resting seven of the team - including Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling - that lost to Newcastle on the weekend. 

Despite this Liverpool pushed the European champions all the way and the two teams were only separated by a Karim Benzema first-half effort. 

Here, Sportsmail's Dominic King gives his verdict on how the players performed at the Bernabeu on Tuesday. 

Karim Benzema celebrates opening the scoring for Real Madrid against Liverpool on Tuesday

Real Madrid (4-2-2-2)

Iker Casillas - 6

A veteran of these occasions, his biggest issue was staying warm on a freezing night. 

Alvaro Arbeloa - 7

No surprises from the former Liverpool man; got through his work quietly and efficiently.  

Raphael Varane - 6.5

Didn’t need to engage his top gear to keep Fabio Borini and Co at arms length.

Sergio Ramos - 6.5

Back to fitness. Largely untroubled but booked for one rash tackle on Adam Lallana.

Marcelo - 8

Magnificent cross created the opening goal for Karim Benzema; never under threat defensively.

Toni Kroos - 7.5

A player who makes the game at the highest level look easy. Always had time and space. 

Luka Modric - 7

Never wasted a pass but, then again, was never put under extreme pressure.

Isco - 7

Not even first choice when Gareth Bale is fit. Keeps play effortlessly ticking over. 

James Rodriguez - 7

In any other team, he would be the superstar. Wasn’t as impressive as he was at Anfield though. 

Cristiano Ronaldo - 6.5

Skirted around the edges of the game apart from a couple of shots. Not the night for a record breaker. 

Cristiano Ronaldo has a shot at goal but the Portuguese superstar had a quiet night by his high standards

Karim Benzema - 8.5

The best out-and-out striker in world football at present; took his goal clinically. 

Subs

Nacho (for Arebola, 83 mins)

Bale 7 (for Rodriguez, 62)

Hernandez (for Benzema, 87) 

Liverpool (4-2-3-1)

Simon Mignolet - 7.5 

Hasn’t been in good form but grew in confidence after making two excellent saves early on.

Javier Manquillo - 7

Not a player who makes headlines but he defends very well and stuck to his task against Marcelo.   

Martin Skrtel - 6.5 

Got into a muddle early on, never given a moment’s piece by the relentless Benzema. 

Kolo Toure - 8

Gets criticised but this was quite possibly his best game in a Liverpool shirt. Can’t lose his place after this.

Alberto Moreno - 7.5 

Liverpool’s best summer signing continues to make a positive impression; lots of energy, looks a proper player.  

Lucas Leiva - 7

Diligent in the middle, made his tackles and used the ball simply when he had it. 

Emre Can - 6

Yet to show why Liverpool were so delighted to complete his signing. Game passed him by. 

Adam Lallana - 7

Took time to get into the game but impressed in the second half and came closest to scoring.

Joe Allen - 7

Dispossessed Ronaldo early on with a good tackle and got better from there, a terrier scampering after possession.

Lazar Markovic - 5

Things just aren’t working for the £20m winger, failed to make any kind of impact. 

Fabio Borini - 6.5

Work ethic not in question but given no service so couldn’t test Casillas.

Subs 

Coutinho 6 (for Can, 75mins)

Gerrard 6 (for Lucas, 69) 

Sterling 6 (for Markovic, 69)
