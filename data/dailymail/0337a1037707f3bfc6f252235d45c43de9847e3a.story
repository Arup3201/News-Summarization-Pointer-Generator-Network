It has been described as an architecturally designed modernist property that was built ahead of its time.

The neighbours have a more colloquial description: it's the penis house.

Either way, the home in Church Point, north of Sydney, is generating plenty of interest.

Locals and prospective buyers have been poking fun at the floor plan of the property because it resembles the shape of a part of the male anatomy.

Whatever the shape, real estate agent Phil Vanstone says the four-bedroom residence is expected to sell for more than $1.1 million.

The double brick property was designed by architect Stan Symonds Sherwin and built back in 1958

The double brick property was designed by architect Stan Symonds Sherwin and built back in 1958.

But Mr Vanstone, of LJ Hooker Mona Vale, believes Sherwin's suggestive floorplan was intentional. 

'It's a very interesting house and has gained quite a following,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'Although locals have been joking about the floorplan, the house has had no modifications since it was built which shows that it's a very livable house.

'I would also put money on the fact that Stan deliberately designed it that way to make a point.'

Mr Vanstone further says the size of the property is no laughing matter as it is set on 1,204 sqm 'with a tranquil bushland backdrop', making it quite an 'attractive home to live in'.

Mr Vanstone wasn't too fazed about what the locals thought of the home as he believes it's a 'really well thought out floorplan'

The house has been on the market for two weeks and will have its third opening this Saturday

The property has sandstone features, timber kitchen and a spacious outdoor entertaining area with an in-ground pool

Mr Vanstone wasn't too fazed about what the locals thought of the home as he believes it's a 'really well thought out floorplan'.

'We've had a couple of buyers point out what the design looks like and I guess it's all a bit of fun,' he said.

'But there have been several offers from buyers and because there's quite a bit of interest, the owners are looking to put it up for auction around early April.'

The property has sandstone features, timber kitchen and a spacious outdoor entertaining area with an in-ground pool.

It has been on the market for two weeks and will have its third opening this Saturday.
