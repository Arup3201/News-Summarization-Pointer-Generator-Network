A Polygamous family have told how they have shunned Mormonism and opted to preach 'love and commitment' over 'fear of 
hell or the promise of heaven.'

TV program My Five Wives, which debuted Sunday, follows Brady Williams, his five wives and their 
combined 24 children who live together on their large family property 
outside Salt Lake City, Utah.

The newest polygamous 
family from Utah on reality TV considers itself progressive and 
independent and believes in a god which 'does not judge'.

Despite having left the church, the family still lives in a polygamous community outside Salt Lake Cit

Williams and his wives slowly withdrew from the 
fundamentalist Mormon church in their rural community outside of Salt 
Lake City during the mid-2000s after re-evaluating their core beliefs.

The
 family no longer teaches the tenets of fundamental Mormonism to their 
children at home, opting instead to take from other teachings such as 
Buddhism to instill good, moral values in their two dozen children, who
 range in age from 2-20.

'Since we have left 
the religion, it's now about love and it's about commitment, and it's 
about happiness as a family,' said Mr Williams, 43, a project manager
 in his brother's construction business. 'It's not about the fear of 
hell or the promise of heaven.'

It wasn't the 
first time Mr Williams has crossed religious lines.

Husband of five: Brady was raised in the mainstream Mormon church, but when he was 16 his family became fundamentalist and began believing in polygamy

As a teenager, 
his parents left mainstream Mormonism and joined polygamy. He said that 
transition was very difficult, but not as hard as leaving the 
fundamentalist church his five wives all grew up in.

The
 show will go behind closed doors and focus on the frustrations, needs 
and fears of a family living the controversial lifestyle, according to a
 TLC press release.

Though their beliefs have estranged from many family members, the members of the Williams family believe that their sacrifices are worth it.

First wife Paulie, a dental hygienist, has been married to Brady for 21 years, and the couple's six children range in age from 20 to nine years old.

She was raised in a polygamist family and expected her husband to have additional wives, but her oldest daughter is recently married and plans a monogamist lifestyle.

He then married second wife Robyn - dubbed 'the creative wife' for her art classes and love of making gifts for the family - about nine months after his ceremony to Paulie, and they have five children.

Divide and conquer: Each wife cooks dinner for the 30-strong family one night a week

Each wife has her own space. The family is divided across 5 apartments in two homes they are just yards from each other. Three wives live in this home, each with their own front door, separate kitchen and own personal bedroom. Brady rotates between the five nightly

Third wife Rosemary worked in the family construction business but stopped after winning a scholarship at the local college, where she is studying for her teaching degree in music. She has four children with Mr Williams.

Nonie, the fourth wife, was living in Montana when she met her husband 15 year ago, and the duo had a long-distance relationship.

She is the only wife that works with him, handling the administrative side of the family's construction business, while being a mom to their five children.

Fifth wife Rhonda is Robyn's cousin. She entered the picture 12 years ago, and admits that it took eight years before she really felt that she belonged in the family.

Though she says that there are downsides to polygamy, she loves that her four children have other mothers around.

Cameras were allowed into the bedroom, and the women will speak openly about their frustrations with Brady's schedule.

On the show the wives detailed how they each cook dinner for the massive family of 30 one night a week.

Brady rotates bedrooms on a nightly basis, so each wife gets him one night of five.

The family lives on a two home compound in polygamous community outside Salt Lake City. Two homes are divided into five apartments.

Each wife has her own kitchen and living space, as well her own bedroom and bedrooms for her biological children.

Brady goes between.

The wives also pend their birthday and anniversary with Brady.

The show premiered on September 15, right after Sister Wives - the reality show that first brought polygamy into many Americans' living rooms.
