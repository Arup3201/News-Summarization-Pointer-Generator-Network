A pensioner who was paralysed 11 years ago is claiming she can now walk again after experiencing a 'miracle' at a church in southern Italy.

Michelina Comegna, 74, was struck by the 'miracle' during morning mass at a church in modern Pompei.

'I took communion and instantly felt a fire going from my feet up my legs and my whole body. At the same time, I was overcome by an intense scent of flowers', she said.

I forgot I was in church and looked around, convinced my clothes were on fire. I was covered in sweat, it was dripping from my head like water. I told my husband I was feeling an intense joy, and I needed to walk,' she said reported Gazzetta del Sud On Line.

'It was so strong, that I began to become scared. I forgot that I was in a church; because of the burning sensation I thought I was on fire.'

In April 2003 she was paralysed following breast cancer surgery and a brain aneurysm that left her bed-ridden for three years.

A mastectomy and several cycles of chemotherapy followed, and she spent the next 11 years in and out of a wheelchair, afflicted with partial paralysis.

Ms Comegna has attended the Shrine of the Virgin of the Rosary of Pompei for years, but says it was not until taking communion at a service last month that her prayers were answered.

Vicar Giuseppe Adamo confirmed he had witnessed the incident, although remained cautious about declaring a miracle and said the church was waiting for a medical report, reported The Local.

Archbishop Tommaso Caputo, who is in charge of the cathedral, also urged caution. 'We must wait for conclusive scientific evidence.

'While many prodigious events have taken place in this sanctuary by the intercession of the Virgin Mary, it is up to medical science to produce the evidence to confirm them'.

But Ms Comegnaâ€™s husband, Giovanni Passaro, insists his wife has received a miracle.

'I have seen a great miracle...it changed everything,' he was quoted as saying.

'She got up and quickly walked towards the nave. I asked her to stop, but she went and had no sign of paralysis.'

In February a 20-year-old US college student who was paralysed in a sporting accident says he received messages from God telling him the exact day he would walk again - and he did.
