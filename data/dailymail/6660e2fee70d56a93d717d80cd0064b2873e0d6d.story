White Republicans think race is getting too much attention in Ferguson, Missouri where violent protests have erupted following the cop shooting of an unarmed black teenager.

According to new research from the Pew Center, almost half of white people (47 per cent) surveyed think that race is getting too much attention in Ferguson compared to 18 per cent of black people and 25 per cent of Hispanics who feel the same way. 

Some 61 per cent of Republicans think that racial issues are grabbing too many headlines compared to 21 per cent of Democrats and 46 per cent of Independents, according to the poll of 1,000 adults.

Protesters on Monday night in Ferguson alongside Amnesty International workers who have moved in to monitor the situation for the first time ever in the U.S.  Conservative commentators have said race is getting too much attention following the riots in the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting

Another survey question show a racial divide in trusting the police to carry out a thorough investigation. 

More than half (52 per cent) of white people surveyed said they had confidence in the shooting investigation compared to only 18 per cent of black people.  

The research appeared to lend support to the tone of some conservative commentators who have been quick to slam Obama for his perceived racial basis.

The President called for understanding in the face of racially-charged anger on Monday, saying that the vast majority of protesters in a St. Louis suburb were peaceful, but warned that a small minority was undermining justice.

He expressed sympathy for the 'passions and anger' sparked by the death of Brown but said giving in to that anger through looting and attacks on police only stirs tensions and leads to further chaos.

He said overcoming the mistrust endemic between many communities and their local police would require Americans to 'listen and not just shout.'

'That's how we're going to move forward together, by trying to unite each other and understand each other and not simply divide ourselves from one another,' Obama told reporters at the White House. 

Fox News host Todd Starnes tweeted about another comment Obama had made after a reporter's question about racial tensions in Ferguson.

Starnes posted: 'Obama: "I have to be very careful about not pre-judging." Well, that train has already left the station.'

Almost half of white people surveyed by Pew believed that race was getting too much attention following the shooting of Michael Brown 

Conservative lawyer Larry Klayman accused the President of starting a 'race war' and giving preferential treatment to his 'black brothers'. 

Journalist Daniel Greenfield wrote a piece for FrontPage magazine entitled 'Obama's Racism For Fun And Profit' where he remarked: 'Obama sends racial and post-racial signals...He tends to avoid explicitly racist rhetoric. Instead he empowers those who do.'

The Pew research on Ferguson followed a study on Monday which found more than half of black Americans think Officer Darren Wilson should be convicted of murdering Michael Brown - compared to just 17 per cent of white Americans.

The results, from a survey carried out by Rasmussen, revealed a stark difference in attitudes towards the death of the 18-year-old, which has sparked riots in the St Louis suburb and across the U.S.

Nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of the 1,000 American adults surveyed believe Wilson should be found guilty of murder, while another quarter (26 per cent) thought he was acting in self defense when he gunned down the unarmed teenager in broad daylight on August 9.

But 57 per cent of black adults think he should be convicted compared to only 17 per cent of white Americans and 24 per cent of other minority Americans.

Of those who are undecided about what should happened to Wilson, most - 56 per cent - are white.

The survey results also showed that black Americans are more convinced that the violent riots since the killing are legitimate outrage rather than criminal activity. 

The racial divide: 80 per cent of black people surveyed thought Brown's shooting raised racial issues (left) while three-quarters of African-Americans had little confidence in the police to investigate properly

Police have said they fired tear gas and rubber bullets in response to gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails over the weekend.

Exactly a quarter of all those surveyed said they believed the protests have mostly been legitimate outrage, whereas 52 per cent think the riots have been carried out by criminals taking advantage of the situation.  

Among these, 54 per cent of white Americans and 53 per cent of other minorities think the violence is mostly down to criminals, compared to 35 per cent of black people surveyed.

In addition, black Americans are more likely to think the protests are legitimate anger.

As tension grows in Ferguson, the Missouri State Police and the state National Guard have been called in to help deal with the violence.

Of those who took part in the survey, 27 per cent believe the police have responded well, while a similar percentage - 28 - call their response 'poor'. 

Conservative commentators, among them Fox host Todd Starnes, have claimed President Obama is showing racial bias when it comes to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson last week 

The results also showed that black Americans were more than twice as likely as whites and other minority adults to rate the police response as poor.

The racial divide apparent in the survey results is reminiscent of the trial of George Zimmerman, who shot dead an unarmed African-American teenager in Florida in 2012. Zimmerman was found not guilty at a trial last year.

This latest survey shows that eight out of ten black voters believe the system is unfair to minorities.

Brown, 18, was shot dead on August 9 and sustained six bullet wounds, including the fatal shot to the top of his head. His killer was identified as Darren Wilson, who has since been placed on paid administrative leave.

The survey by Rasmussen Reports was carried out on August 15 and 16 and involved 1,000 people.
