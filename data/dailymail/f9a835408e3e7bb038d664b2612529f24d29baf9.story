Andy Coulson asked no questions about Prince Harry's medical records obtained by former NotW Royal editor Clive Goodman, a court heard

Andy Coulson raised no questions when a reporter emailed him about Prince Harry's confidential medical files while he was editor of the News of the World, a court heard today.

Former NotW royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, emailed his boss in January 2005 about Prince Harry being injured, jurors heard in the hacking trial today.

This move effectively gave 'the game away' about hacking at the Sunday tabloid, a court heard.

In the email, Goodman told Coulson that the 'health inf. is from the doctor himself scammed from Helen Aspey', in reference to a royal aide.

Cross examining Goodman, prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: 'What you are telling him is you have been into Prince Harry's medical records and he does not ask you anything at all?'

The witness agreed.

Mr Edis said: 'Getting into anybody's medical records is a pretty serious thing for a journalist to do. You are telling the editor the second in line to the throne.'

Goodman corrected: 'Third in line.'

The lawyer continued: 'Never the less, whatever he was he is a pretty important person to be spying on.

'What you are saying to the editor here by some dishonest means, you have managed to obtain some confidential information.'

Goodman accepted it was 'wrong and shouldn't have happened.'

Mr Edis asked: 'Did he ever say anything to you about what you had done and whether it was appropriate?'

Goodman said Coulson had not said anything, but the background showed there was a public interest in the prince's health.

Mr Edis asked: 'Are you saying there was a conversation about public interest in this story?'

The witness said there was no conversation with the editor.

The prosecutor asserted: 'It's a pretty strong clue about what it is - the health information comes from the doctor himself, scammed from Helen Aspey - so you are not trying to hide what had happened from Mr Coulson.

'If you had wanted to hide what you were up to you would be a lot less open.

In cross examination Goodman, pictured, said the records were obtained by dishonest means - which was 'wrong and shouldn't have happened'

'You are giving the game away. If he thinks about this carefully he can probably work out what's gone on.

'You did not think there was anything to hide.'

Goodman replied: 'At that point I don't think Andy Coulson was aware I was phone hacking.'

Mr Edis replied: 'This email is pretty much telling him.'

Coulson denies charges of conspiring to hack phones and making corrupt payments to public officials. Goodman is not accused of hacking in the current trial but also denies conspiring to pay public officials.

The Old Bailey trial was adjourned until 10am on Monday.
