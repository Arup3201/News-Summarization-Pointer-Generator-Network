A baby girl, believed to be five months old, was brought to a Texas fire station Monday by a woman who said she was babysitting the child and that the mother never returned.

A woman who only identified herself as Alysha told firefighters she and a friend had agreed to look after the child named Lily for the evening.

When morning came, the pair didn't hear from the mother and by the afternoon, Alysha decided to take the child to the fire station.

Bouncing baby girl: The little girl was in good spirits and seemed to be in good health

Abandoned: Lily is now in the care of Child Protective Services while police search for her mother

She told Click 2 Houston that she and her friend met the baby's mother around 3am Monday. She asked Alysha and her friend if they could take care of her five-month-old baby.

The women gave the baby's mother a ride back to the Cullen Inn Motel where she had been staying with her daughter. That's when Alysha realized the baby had been left alone in the hotel room all night.

She said some medication indicated the infant is named Lily.

'We took the baby for the night and told her to give us a call in the morning and she didn't,' Alysha told Click 2 Houston.

'She hasn't called, hasn't tried to find out where her baby is.'

Soft side: The firefighters were quite taken with their tiny charge

Babysitter: The woman who was caring for Lily, known only as Alysha

Left alone: Alysha said the mother and child were staying in this motel, and that the baby had been left alone in the room

'Pretty much bringing her here was the last resort because we don't know where she belongs.'

'The word was that we would help the mom because she was supposedly trying to get money for the baby's diapers,' she told Click2Houston.

On Monday afternoon around 2pm, Alysha took Lily to Fire Station 35 in southeast Houston, not knowing what else to do.

She said the firefighters were surprised when she walked in the door but she was impressed by their offers of help.

'Well,
 they were like a little bit shocked,' she told Khou. 'They were more than
 willing to help and they jumped right into action.'

Safe haven: Alysha took Lily to this fire station when she realized the mother was not going to return

Fire officials say Lily seems in good health and was clean and happy when she was dropped off.

Texas's Safe Haven or Baby Moses Law states that a baby may be left in a designated safe place, such as a fire station, with no questions asked and without fear of consequence if its carers are unable to care for their child - but this law only applies babies 60 days or younger.

Since baby Lily is believed to be about five months old, the law cannot apply to her.

She is in the care of Child Protective Services as police search for her mother. They were still looking for leads on the mother Tuesday morning.
