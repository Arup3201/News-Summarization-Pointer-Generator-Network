Tony Abbott says he's feeling 'young and vigorous' after his approval rating rose to a four month high despite coming under fire in recent weeks for a series of gaffes.

Support for the Abbott government rose three points, while Labor fell three points - making both parties tied on a primary vote of 38 percent, according to the latest Newspoll published by News Corp.  

'Karl, you know what it's like to be young and vigorous and at the height of your powers,' the Prime Minister told Karl Stefanovic on Today this morning.

'That is exactly how I feel. There are some mornings we don't feel like that but that is certainly how I feel this morning.'

Tony Abbott says he's feeling 'young and vigorous' after his approval rating rose to a four month high in the latest opinion polls

The percentage of those voters satisfied with Mr Abbott's performance rose to 25 percent in the latest opinion poll. 

But Labor leader Bill Shorten took a hit with his satisfaction rating down to a record low of 35 percent.

The latest opinion poll was taken over the weekend where Mr Abbott was in full force talking about his response to tackling terrorists and national security. 

Despite Mr Abbott's bump in the polls, 77 percent of those surveyed consider him arrogant and only one one-third of them believe he is in touch with voters.

It comes after a rough few weeks in which the Prime Minister was ridiculed for controversially giving Prince Philip a knighthood, admitting he felt no guilt 'whatsoever' for children in detention centres and describing job losses under the Labor government as a 'holocaust of jobs'.

While Mr Abbott also managed to survive a motion for a leadership spill this month, it emerged on Tuesday seven ministers who had expressed support for him have now put him on notice, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 

The seven ministers, who asked not to be named, voted for Mr Abbott in the spill motion but say they are now prepared to help remove him if he can't revive the budget and further recover the approval ratings.

Several ministers have reportedly reached out to Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, but one said: 'There's not overwhelming support yet for Malcolm [Turnbull] and it needs to be.'

'I'm focused on government. I know there are always some people in this business of politics who would rather pursue their own ambitions than the national interest but I am absolutely focused on getting on with government,' Mr Abbott told Today. 

'There is a sense in which Prime Ministers are always on probation. There is a sense in which every day you have to perform. It is true you have to perform. It is true of you, it is true of me, it is true of most of us.'

Support for the Abbott government (L-R: Treasuer Joe Hockey, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Tony Abbott) rose three points, while Labor fell three points - making both parties tied on a primary vote of 38 percent
