Manuela Sykes - a former Labour politician at Westminster City Council - can return home on a one-month trial basis

An 89-year-old who suffers from dementia has won a court fight to return to the flat where she has lived for 60 years because she is 'miserable' in a care home.

A Court of Protection judge has ruled that Manuela Sykes - a former Labour politician at Westminster City Council, stood for Parliament, edited a trade union newspaper for 40 years and campaigned for better treatment for dementia sufferers - can return home on a one-month trial basis.

District Judge Anselm Eldergill also ruled that Ms Sykes could be named in media reports - in line with her wishes and after journalists argued that identification would be in the public interest.

Lawyers representing the pensioner said the judge's decision to allow identification was 'rare'.

Detail of Judge Eldergill's decision has emerged in a written ruling following a Court of Protection hearing in London.

Court of Protection judges analyse cases involving vulnerable and sick people. Hearings are often held in private and people involved are not normally identified because of their vulnerability.

Judge Eldergill concluded that a one-month trial of home-based care would be in Ms Sykes' best interests - even though social workers from her local authority, Westminster City Council, had raised concerns about her welfare if she left a care home.

The judge said if a trial was not attempted she would never again have the chance to live in her own home.

And he said all viable alternatives should be explored before a conclusion could be reached that it was in Ms Sykes' best interests to spend the rest of her life in a care home.

Judge Eldergill said his decision to lift the 'usual veil of anonymity' had been 'finely balanced'.

But he said the case was 'relatively unusual' and Ms Sykes' personality was a critical factor.

He said she had always 'wished to be heard', would want her life to end with a 'bang not a whimper' and had a 'last chance to exert a political influence'.

He also said 'archival photographs' of Ms Sykes could be published - although not a current picture.

Anne-Marie Irwin - a specialist Court of Protection solicitor from law firm Irwin Mitchell, who had represented pensioner's interests during litigation - said Ms Sykes had been a 'leading dementia campaigner' who now suffered with the illness and was 'miserable' in a care home.

'Manuela is firmly of the view that with the right kind of care package, she could be supported to return home safely,' she said.

'Although the kindness of her carers was praised, Manuela was miserable at the care home, and we asked the court to consider if it is truly in her best interests to remain deprived of her liberty.

'The court was asked on her behalf - what is the point of being kept safe, when to do so is also making you miserable?'

She added: 'We are confident that with specialist dementia carers Ms Sykes can greatly benefit from returning to her own home.'

Ms Sykes was born in Mexico to parents who met in the United States, according to an interview with the Trebus project - a website that documents the life stories of people suffering from dementia, all of which can be read or listened to on their website.

During the Second World War Ms Sykes worked in the Women's Royal Naval Service, known as the Wren's, as a direction officer, allowing aircraft to land and take off from an aircraft carrier.

Her mother also suffered from dementia, with Ms Sykes telling the website she had 'given her a terribly hard time' over it.

Her hope in speaking to the Trebus project was that people could learn more about what living with dementia was actually like and to improve public understanding of the illness.

In May 2011 her dementia story was read by Welsh actress Sian Phillips for a Radio 4 series called Ancient Mysteries produced by Charlie Higson and Paul Whitehouse.
