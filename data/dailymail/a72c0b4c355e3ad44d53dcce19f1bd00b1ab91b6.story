Two members of Greece's Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn were slain and another wounded tonight in a drive-by shooting thought to be a revenge attack by anti-fascists.

The two victims, aged 22 and 27, were shot at close range outside a Golden Dawn office in Athens' Neo Iraklio suburb by two men riding a motorcycle.

'A man got off a motorcycle wearing a helmet and shot them,' Golden Dawn lawmaker Georgios Germenis told The Associated Press.

A statement on the party's website described how the gunmen had 'literally emptied their weapons' into the victims.

A third man, aged 29, was taken to hospital severely wounded after he too was shot.

The
 government and opposition parties quickly condemned the shootings, 
which the left-wing main opposition Syriza said 'targets democracy' in 
Greece.

Officials are 
treating it as a likely far-left domestic terrorist attack. It occurred 
amid a crackdown on Golden Dawn activists after the fatal stabbing of an
 anti-fascist musician in Athens.

The
 death of Pavlos Fyssas on September 17 sparked outrage across Greece, 
with riots breaking out in six cities in the immediate aftermath of the 
killing.

The 34-year-old 
rapper, who went by the stage name Killah P, was stabbed twice outside a
 cafe in the Keratsini area west of Athens by a man who identified 
himself as a Golden Dawn supporter.

The
 45-year-old suspect, who was discovered close to a knife with traces of
 blood on it, has been charged with Mr Fyssas's murder.

The
 party's leader and two of its lawmakers were subsequently jailed 
pending trial on charges of forming a criminal group. The party has 
denied any wrongdoing.Â 

Investigators gather evidence at the scene of 
the crime, which detectives believe was carried out by far-left or 
anarchist anti-fascists. It comes a month and a half after a Golden Dawn
 man stabbed a left-wing rapper

office

Golden Dawn, whose senior members have expressed admiration for Hitler although they deny being neo-Nazi, rose from obscurity during Greece's financial crisis to win 18 out of 300 seats in Parliament in last year elections.

It is now polling as the recession-plagued nation's third most popular political party with the support of around 12 per cent of the electorate.

Party members and supporters, often clearly identifiable in black T-shirts and combat pants, have been suspected of beatings and stabbings across the country, usually of dark-skinned migrants.

They are violently opposed by Greece's active far-left and anarchist extremist groups that have claimed a string of shootings and bombings that killed two policemen and a journalist.

However, as yet there has been no no claim of responsibility for tonight's shootings and police said no arrests were made. The counter-terrorism squad has taken over the investigation.

'We are examining every possibility, but the indications are that it is a terrorist attack,' a police official said on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorised to be quoted publicly.

Golden Dawn MP Giorgos Germenis talks on the 
phone at the office shortly after the killings outside. He told the 
Associated Press that the attack came right after police stopped 
protecting the office

A Golden Dawn statement also blamed the shooting on terrorists.

'The criminals wanted to execute anybody outside the party offices,' the statement posted on Golden Dawn's website said.

'Before they drove off, the terrorists shot again at the boys lying on the ground. They literally emptied their weapons on them.'

Public Order Minister Nikos Dendias expressed 'distress' at the fatal shooting of the two young men.

'We will not allow the country to become a ground for the settling of accounts, for whatever reason,' he said.

Mr Germenis, who said the killings had been caught on CCTV, said the attack came right after police stopped protecting the office targeted.

'The government stripped us naked so that we can be killed,' he told the AP.

'We had received threats at that office, and we informed the local police station. They had plainclothes police outside the office every day until today.'
