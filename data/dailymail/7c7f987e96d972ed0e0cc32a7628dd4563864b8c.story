Like the components of some abandoned Frankenstein's monster, the carefully pickled remains of animals lie slowly stewing in jars stowed in this eerie abandoned place.

After decades of neglect, even the formaldehyde that preserves these parts of anatomy has yellowed with age, while the specimens themselves slowly fall apart.

The patina of age colours these scenes from an abandoned laboratory - equipped with anatomical samples including parts of kittens and dogs to a pigs head and even whole rats - with a palette reminiscent of a Gothic novel.

Inside of the abandoned Veterinary School of 
Anderlecht, Belgium: Hundreds of anatomical samples sit decaying in 
yellowing formaldehyde in this abandoned laboratory that has been all 
but forgotten for more than two decades but was found by a British urban explorer who goes by the pseudonym Chaos and took these pictures

Gruesome: A decaying brain sample has sullied the preservative fluid it was kept in, while right dozens of microscope slides litter the floor, gathering dust

Dark place: The patina of age colours these 
scenes from an abandoned laboratory - equipped with anatomical samples 
including parts of kittens and dogs to a pigs head and even whole rats -
 with a palette reminiscent of a Gothic novel, but it was in reality only finally closed in 1990

Grim collection: The shelves of the lab strain beneath the weight of countless samples, each the body part of some long-dead creature

It is all that remains of The Veterinary School of Anderlecht in Brussels, Belgium.

The centre for experimental animal science has stood abandoned since 1990 and, like so many historic places, is soon to be transformed into luxury apartments.

These last glimpses of the gruesome, decaying evidence of endeavour in physiological science were captured by a British urban explorer who prefers to go by the pseudonym Chaos.

He said: 'The Horror Labs, as this location has been nick-named, is like something out of a horror-film.

'My images show what lies behind the walls of a neo-renaissance veterinary school in Belgium which now lies derelict and decaying

'People are initially horrified that this sort of place exists, but are equally intrigued and want to see more.'

Who (would) live in a house like this? The centre for experimental animal science has stood abandoned since 1990 and, like so many historic places, is soon to be transformed into luxury apartments

Experiments: A blood-stained tray lies on the table amid various samples and, curiously, next to what looks like an unsmoked cigarette

The site comprises 19 Flemish neo-Renaissance style buildings, constructed in the early 20th Century, which were later incorporated into the university of Liege in 1969.

In 1990 the buildings became derelict and were listed.

All but one of the buildings have since been converted into executive homes. But this grisly secret still hides deep within the bowels of the one remaining, undeveloped structure.

'It's like being in some crazed professor's laboratory containing all manner of grotesque animal organs and body parts,' he said.

'At any moment you half expect the professor to come bursting through the door to punish you for invading his laboratory.

'Strange as this place seems, it once served a crucial purpose, a school dedicated for the training of veterinary surgeons.'

It has lain abandoned and derelict for more than two decades, while surrounding buildings have been developed

Soon, this place too will be transformed into executive homes. But who would want to live there?
