The multimillion-dollar mansion which was used as a bolthole by John Edwards' mistress while he ran for the White House has been put on the market.

The five-bedroom home which sits on three acres in an exclusive area of Aspen, Colorado, is on the market for $19.95million.

The stunning property belonged to lawyer Fred Baron, a major Democratic party donator, who allowed Hunter the run of his home during the 2008 presidential race.

The property boasts five full bathrooms, three half baths, multiple fireplaces and a gourmet kitchen with breakfast nook.

There is also his-and-her offices, a library, billiards room, indoor pool with a hot tub, spa, sauna, gym and full-size racquetball court.

The home is packed with millions of dollars in art, furniture, furnishings and antiques, according to Curbed.com

The stone mansion was built in 1994 from plans by renowned architect Robert A.M. Stern who has also worked on projects including the revamp of New York's theater district on 42nd street and multiple hotels for Disney.

The 14,000 sq ft holiday home sits on Starwood Drive in Aspen and has breathtaking views across the exclusive mountain ski resort.

Hunter was ensconced at the mansion, along with her minders, during the 2008 election campaign while she was pregnant with Edwards' love child.

The one-time presidential candidate 
was acquitted in June after a six-week federal trial over the improper 
use of campaign funds.

Jurors acquitted Edwards on one count of
accepting illegal campaign contributions and deadlocked on five other 
felony counts so the judge declared a mistrial.

Edwards was accused of masterminding a scheme to use $1million in secret payments from two wealthy political donors to hide his mistress and their lovechild as he sought the White House in 2008.

Baron, who died in 2008, was connected with the trial and allegedly provided money for Hunter and left a private jet at her disposal. The mansion is being sold by Baron's widow Lisa Blue, also a lawyer.

Hunter released a memoir What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our 
Daughter, and Me, which was published shortly after he was acquitted in a North Carolina court.

It was poorly received, selling just 6,000 copies despite Hunter's glut of media coverage and extensive interviews.

John Edwards emerged from the court house earlier this year saying that he was grateful to all of his children - including his 'precious Quinn' - the child from his affair with Ms Hunter.

The trial exposed a sordid sex scandal that unfolded while Edwards' wife Elizabeth was dying of cancer but prosecutors couldn't convince jurors that he had masterminded a $1 million cover-up of his affair. Elizabeth Edwards died of cancer in December 2010.

John Edwards met Ms Hunter, now 48, when she came to work as a video-grapher for his 2004 presidential campaign. The pair started a romantic relationship while they were on the road.

After the pair began their romantic liaison, she fell pregnant and agreed with the plan to have Edwards’ long-time aide Andrew Young claim paternity in an effort to keep Edwards’ political prospects alive.
