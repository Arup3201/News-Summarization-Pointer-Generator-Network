A celebrity superfan with an insatiable appetite for selfies has revealed his astonishing collection of photographs with the rich and famous. 

Perry O'Bree, an aspiring actor from Dover, Kent, has travelled across the country to meet some of his favourite actors, singers and reality stars. 

Among the 20-year-old's personal photo album are portraits of with Nicole Kidman, Demi Lovato and Ellie Goulding.

But while Perry is keen to pose with as many stars as possible, he has revealed the perils of hunting down celebrities for a quick snap. 

'Going to meet celebs is a big risk - you can miss them by a matter of minutes. You can turn up at an event and the paps will push you to the floor which is what I have seen.

'If you don't get there hours and hours before then you can miss out. But a lot of it has been spontaneous.'

In the past year alone Perry has posed with  Jack Whitehall and singers Sam Smith, Ellie Goulding, Ella Henderson and Ariana Grande.

He's also posed with McFly's Tom Fletcher and Harry Judd, Paul O'Grady and Brendan O'Carroll and Jennifer Gibney from Mrs Brown's Boys and Sherlock's Andrew Scott. American songstress Taylor Swift was among the more forthright of subjects. 

'I didn't really know what to say to Taylor. She took my phone off me and asked if I wanted a picture.

'Some guy asked her to sign a light bulb,' said Perry. 

But of all the A-listers Perry has posed with his favourite is Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe who he met at a premier for fantasy thriller Horns in 2013.

He said: 'He was really nice. We were just general chatting, how I was, that sort of thing. I made sure I didn't mention Harry Potter.'
