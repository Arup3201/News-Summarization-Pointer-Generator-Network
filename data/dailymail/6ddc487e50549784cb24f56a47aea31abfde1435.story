Arrested: Marion County High School teacher and football coach Michael Schmitt has been accused of spray painting his team's field house

When a Tennessee high school football field house was vandalized about two weeks ago, authorities suspected the culprits were from a rival team.

But in a shocking twist, police yesterday arrested the school's own football coach, Michael Schmitt.

The father-of-four allegedly wanted to inspire his Marion County High School players before a big game. His team lost.

Schmitt, 39, is accused of scrawling vulgarities across the field house, storage building and on the concrete parking lot in the early-morning hours of November 1.

His team was due to play the South Pittsburg prep football team that day.

The schools' rivalry is one of the oldest and most heated in Tennessee.

The suspect used black and orange spray - the school colors of the South Pittsburg Pirates - causing about $7,000 in damage.

The derogatory messages named individual coaches and trashed the town, Deadspin reported.

One read, 'Only p*****s wear purple', the Marion County school colors, and another said, 'f**k this house'.

Large power 'Ps' - South Pittsburg's logo - were painted on the buildings
to make it look like Pirates supporters were the culprits, according to Chattanooga Times.

According to his profile on the Marion County High School website, Schmitt is a father of four with a social sciences degree

However South Pittsburg was quick to deny its involvement.

'Our senior captains came to me and asked if they could go up there and help clean it up because they're as embarrassed as I am and they don't want people thinking we allow thugs like that in our school,' South Pittsburg's principal Danny Wilson said, according to Deadspin.

'We warned all of our kids at school yesterday to stay out of Jasper, and I hope they can identify who it was, because if it was any of our kids we will drop the full hammer on them.'

The tight-knit community was shocked by Schmitt's arrest.

'It is sad to say that this event gives 
the whole community a black eye and the real victims of this incident 
are the kids from both schools,' Marion County Sheriff's Detective 
Matt Blansett said.

Officers claim the vandalism 
was an attempt to inspire the Marion County football team before its 
game. The team ended up losing to the Pirates, 35-17.

The Sheriff's department would not 
confirm whether other coaches were involved.

It is likely the suspect was identified in surveillance footage.

Schmitt was arrested and booked into the Marion County jail on charges of vandalism of $1,000 to $10,000. He was released on $2,500 bond.

Deadspin reported Schmitt has been suspended without pay pending his January court appearance. His profile is still listed on the school's website.

'It's very unfortunate if it comes out to be a factual case against Mr. Schmitt. Very unfortunate for students to act that way, much less adults,' Marion County Schools Superintendent Mark Griffith told WRCB.
