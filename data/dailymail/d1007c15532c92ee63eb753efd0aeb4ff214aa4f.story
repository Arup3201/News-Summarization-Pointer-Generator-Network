Trainer Aidan O’Brien has acknowledged he is likely to have Ryan Moore riding more of his horses this season.

Speculation has raged about the likely riding plans for Ireland’s champion trainer, with son and stable jockey Joseph having his first ride over hurdles at Limerick on Sunday when fifth on Egyptian Warrior.

Joseph said that he will be back riding on the Flat on Wednesday at Dundalk but the constant battle with the scales for the jockey who is almost 6ft has seemingly never been tougher.

Three-time British champion Moore stepped in for three rides for Aidan O’Brien at the Curragh on Sunday, winning on The Warrior. The trainer said: ‘We’ve a good relationship with Ryan and we always have. We used Ryan more last year than we did the year before and hopefully it will be that way again this year.’

Acknowledging his son’s weight issues, O’Brien added: ‘Obviously (doing) nine stone has been a problem for the last two seasons and last year it was a big problem.

‘This year he’s heavier than he was this time last year. He’ll go gently and we’ll see what will happen.’

Meanwhile, OIiver Sherwood has said his Hennessy Gold Cup winner Many Clouds will run in the Grand National a week on Saturday with Leighton Aspell on board.

Daryl Jacob will now ride Aspell’s Dr Richard Newland- trained 2014 winner Pineau de Re. Emma Lavelle, who had expected Jacob to ride her outsider Court By Surprise, is now searching for a replacement.

Bailey supplied AP McCoy with a win on his final day riding at Ascot on Sunday. It was a vintage McCoy effort as he urged Bailey’s Un Ace to a short-head win over Royal Regatta.

The retiring champion received a special presentation from Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.
