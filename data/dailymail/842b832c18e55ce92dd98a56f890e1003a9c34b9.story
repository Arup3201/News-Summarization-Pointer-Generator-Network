Smiling and looking relaxed in each other’s company, Tony Blair and the autocratic ruler of Kazakhstan met yesterday for the first time since an £8million consultancy deal was revealed.

The former prime minister held discussions with Nursultan Nazarbayev at the president’s Akorda Palace.

Last month, the Daily Mail revealed that Mr Blair had secured a deal to act as consultant to the former Communist Party apparatchik, who has been widely criticised in the West for human rights abuses and election malpractice.

Plenty to discuss: Tony Blair and Nursultan Nazarbayev during their meeting at the Kazakh president's palace yesterday

Mr Blair now runs an advisory firm and the project in the oil and gas-rich central Asian state is believed to include some of his former Downing Street aides.

The former Labour leader’s office has disputed that the year-long deal is worth £8million, and stated that he is ‘not personally making a profit’ from the arrangement.

His team is providing advice on improving Kazakhstan’s chequered international reputation and forging business links across Europe.

Officials said that during their meeting yesterday Mr Blair and 71-year-old Nazarbayev ‘discussed working out a large-scale programme to modernise the economy of Kazakhstan, as well as a wide range of international issues, in particular, the situation in the European Union and the Middle East’.

It was Mr Blair’s third visit to the Kazakh capital, Astana, in nine months. His wife Cherie has also visited Kazakhstan, in May.

Critics claim Mr Blair’s role gives a mask of respectability to a regime condemned in leaked U.S. diplomatic cables for ‘pervasive corruption’ and using torture.
