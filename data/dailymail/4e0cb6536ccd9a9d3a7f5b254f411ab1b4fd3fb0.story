Triathlon death: Daniel Bagshaw, 27, died competing in the ITU Triathlon in Hong Kong

A young British lawyer collapsed and died while competing in a triathlon race in Hong Kong.

Daniel Bagshaw, 27, fell to the ground near the finish line of the ITU Triathlon Asian Cup on Lantau, near Hong Kong Disneyland, on Sunday, October 14.

It is not yet known what caused the athlete's death but local media sources stated that he may have suffered from undiagnosed heart problems.

Mr Bagshaw, from Accrington, moved to Asia last year to take up a position as a corporate lawyer with international law firm Linklaters.

Neighbours say the former Clitheroe Grammar School student was living with his girlfriend, a teacher.

Daniel is said to have collapsed during the triathlon after completing the swimming and cycling parts of the race.

Hundreds of competitors entered the annual event, which involved a 1.5km swim, a 40km bike ride and 10km run.

A spokesperson for Linklaters said staff were 'shocked and saddened' at the news. They said:?'We can confirm that Daniel Bagshaw, an associate in our Hong Kong office, tragically passed away during the HK triathlon on October 14.

'Dan was a highly talented individual who excelled at all he did, both in and outside the office, and had a terrific future ahead of him.

'He was a hugely popular member of our community at Linklaters and we are all shocked and saddened at his loss. Our thoughts and prayers go to Dan's family and friends during this very difficult time.'

A neighbour on Garden Street said friends of the family had been shocked by the news of Daniel's death.

Neighbour Derek Ward said: 'He lived next door to us for years. It's a very sad thing.'

The Hong Kong Triathlon Association confirmed that an adult competitor collapsed near the finish line.

A spokesman said: 'First-aid personnel stationed by the finish line immediately attended to the stricken athlete.

Ambulance services came very shortly thereafter and evacuated the person to the nearest hospital.

'We are very sad to inform that all efforts at resuscitation were not responsive.

'The association expresses its deepest and sincerest condolences to the deceased's family and friends, and will use our best endeavours to assist them.

'At this moment, our prayers and thoughts are with our comrade, the family and friends.'

A spokesman for the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they were providing consular assistance.
