Speaking about his hobby, he said: 'Photography is my passion, though I do not make money taking pictures at the moment, I do not know if I will in the future. I have been a business advisor for 15 years but I am looking for a new direction in life, I have always hoped to be a photographer.'

Sebastian mainly photographs his family, including his two sons, 8-year-old Jacek and 11-year-old Krzysztof, Kaya his 15-year-old daughter and his wife Agnieszka.
