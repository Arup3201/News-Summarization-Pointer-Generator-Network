Wayne Rooney admitted Manchester United's quarter-final exit to Arsenal was 'hard to take' as his wait for an FA Cup winner's medal goes on.

The England captain has never lifted the famous trophy, arriving at Old Trafford a matter of months after their last triumph in 2004.

Rooney drew United level with a header from Angel di Maria's perfect cross just four minutes after Nacho Monreal had given Arsenal the lead on 25 minutes.

But a weak backpass by Antonio Valencia led to former United player Danny Welbeck rounding goalkeeper David de Gea and slotting home Arsenal's winner just after the hour mark.

A bad night for Louis van Gaal's men was compounded late on when Di Maria was shown a red card for manhandling referee Michael Oliver.

Rooney told MUTV after the match: 'I want to win the Cup for and with the team; it's not about me wanting to win the FA Cup.

'That's why it's so sad for us to get knocked out today, we knew we'd have a great opportunity if we'd won tonight.'

Reflecting on the game, he added: 'We're obviously disappointed. Going into half-time having equalised, we felt that we'd create enough chances to win the game, but it wasn't to be.

'Conceding the second goal the way we did in the second-half meant that we were always chasing the game afterwards. They made it difficult for us and defended well.

'It was a close game, it could have gone either way. Mistakes happen, but it's not nice when you're on the receiving end of one which costs you a goal.

'It's a hard one to take, but we have to dust ourselves down and get ready for Sunday.'

United resume their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League when they welcome Tottenham to Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.

Arsenal have been drawn against either Bradford City or Reading in the Wembley semi-final, to be played on either April 18 or 19.
