Most controversial omission of the night was Anderlecht's Alex Mitrovic. The 20-year-old striker turned up to pre-season training overweight and has struggled for form since, enduring criticism from fans and media. Despite being Anderlecht's record signing, he was dropped to the bench on Wednesday night, rather like Adel Taarabt.

Wenger must linger for longer

Arsene Wenger is pretty proud of his 17 consecutive years in the Champions League but he'll have to go some way beyond his 65th birthday to match Anderlecht's run in Europe. This is the 50th consecutive year the Belgian champions have qualified for European competitions.

The Eurostar Derby?

Watford and Luton used to call their matches the M1 Derby based on the ease with which you can travel between the towns thanks to the motorway. So Arsenal v Anderlecht should by rights be the Eurostar Derby, with both clubs located within two miles of the respective stations at Brussels-Midi/Zuid and St Pancras.

A throwback to Highbury 

Arsenal fans of a certain age would have felt at home at Anderlecht’s Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. Not only was there safe standing for both sets of supporters — something fans want at The Emirates — but the ground is compact with terraced houses and bars adjacent to two sides of the stadium, a throwback to the Highbury days.
