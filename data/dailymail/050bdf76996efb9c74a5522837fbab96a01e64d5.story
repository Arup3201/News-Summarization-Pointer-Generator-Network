Apple has been accused of having major lapses in its online security after a writer had his 'entire digital life' destroyed by hackers in less than an hour

Apple has told its support staff to stop changing user passwords over the phone after a reporter lost his digital life, it was claimed today.

Mat Honan, a reporter for Wired magazine, lost control of his Google, GMail and Twitter accounts after a hacker rang Apple's support and managed to change his Apple ID password.

He was also locked out of his iPhone, and then the hacker wiped his laptop, meaning Honan lost all his images of his one-year-old daughter.

The story became a viral hit after Honan wrote about it.

Reacting to the scandal, Apple has now suspended all password changes over the phone for the next 24 hours, according to an Apple employee who spoke to Wired.

Apple were apparently allowing 
password changes on the phone yesterday - if users had their iPhone to 
hand and could read the serial number of the device to Apple.

The employee told Wired he believed 
the freeze was in place 'to give Apple more time to determine what 
security policies needed to be changed, if any'.

Amazon have also closed a security 
hole which allowed anyone to take control of an Amazon account if they 
knew a customer's name, e-mail address and home address.

It is still possible to change your Apple password online by visiting iforgot.apple.com.

Apple has yet to comment on whether they are permanently changing their security passwords.

In a disturbing article on Wired.com, Honan reveals how he actually spoke to the hacker who carried out the attack.

After telling him how he did it Honan was then able to repeat the same steps - and carry out his very own mock hack.

In the story Honan writes that on August 3 he realised something was wrong when all of a sudden his iPhone powered down.

When
he tried to connect it to his computer he was asked for a four digit 
pin - which the hackers had already put on the machine to stop him from 
accessing it.

During
the hour-and-a-half long phone call with Applecare - during which they 
initially got his name wrong and looked at the wrong account - the full 
story emerged.

Between
4.33pm and 5.12pm the hackers had gone from having no information to 
taking over his whole digital life - and posting a message on his 
Twitter page claiming credit for doing it.

Honan
writes: ‘It turns out, a billing address and the last four digits of a 
credit card number are the only two pieces of information anyone needs 
to get into your iCloud account.

‘Once supplied, Apple will issue a temporary password, and that password grants access to iCloud.’

Writer Matt Honen had his iPad wiped by hackers who exploited a loophole in Apple's security ptotocols

From there the hackers were able to 
access his other accounts as they were all linked to one another - they 
went to his Gmail account and asked for the recovery password to be sent
to his mac.com email, which they already had access to.

Once they had access to his Gmail account, they were able to get control of his Twitter page too.

After
accepting what had happened Honan set up a temporary Twitter account - 
and was shocked when one of the hackers messaged him.

Identifying himself as Phobia, he explained how he hacked Honan just because he ‘liked his username’ and claimed that ‘you honestly can get into any email associated with apple’.

Honan discovered that the hack began when Phobia got his billing address by searching his web domain on Spokeo or WhitePages, which includes details of where a person lives.

His credit card number was obtained by taking advantage of another security breach - this time on Amazon.

Honan writes: ‘First you call Amazon and tell them you are the account holder, and want to add a credit card number to the account.

Most people should be aware of the importance of keeping passwords and logins secure, to regularly change passwords, and to watch out for 'social engineering', where hackers can gain access to your accounts by fooling people into revealing confidential information.

Additionally, users should remember:

‘All you need is the name on the account, an associated e-mail address, and the billing address.

‘Amazon then allows you to input a new credit card. (Wired used a bogus credit card number from a website that generates fake card numbers that conform with the industry’s published self-check algorithm.) Then you hang up.

‘Next you call back, and tell Amazon that you’ve lost access to your account. Upon providing a name, billing address, and the new credit card number you gave the company on the prior call, Amazon will allow you to add a new e-mail address to the account.

‘From here, you go to the Amazon website, and send a password reset to the new e-mail account.

'This allows you to see all the credit cards on file for the account — not the complete numbers, just the last four digits. But, as we know, Apple only needs those last four digits.’

Honan admits that he only has himself to blame for being hacked and wishes he had taken better security steps, such as not ‘daisy chaining’ his accounts together.

He wishes he had not set up ‘Find my Mac’, which allowed the hackers to set up a pin and freeze him out of his computer.

But he also believes that it is still too easy to hack into an Apple account, and claims that anyone could repeat what Phobia did.

Honan said: ‘My experience leads me to believe that cloud-based systems need fundamentally different security measures.

‘Password-based security mechanisms - which can be cracked, reset, and socially engineered - no longer suffice in the era of cloud computing.’

In a statement to Wired, Apple spokesman Natalie Kerris said: ‘Apple takes customer privacy seriously and requires multiple forms of verification before resetting an Apple ID password.

‘In this particular case, the customer’s data was compromised by a person who had acquired personal information about the customer.

‘In addition, we found that our own internal policies were not followed completely.

'We are reviewing all of our processes for resetting account passwords to ensure our customers’ data is protected.’
