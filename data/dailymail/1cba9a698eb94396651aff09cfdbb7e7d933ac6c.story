Manchester United's Daley Blind put on a brave face to thank supporters for their well wishes after he suffered a knee injury while on international duty.

The Dutchman, who has featured eight times in the Premier League for United since his move from Ajax in the summer, was taken off in the first half of Holland's 6-0 win over Latvia.

He took to Twitter on Thursday to thank fans for their messages of support as he works his way back to full fitness.

Blind said: 'Wow, all of a sudden a lot of messages! Still working hard guys, but don't worry; I'll be back stronger! And thanks a lot for all the kind messages!'

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal played down fears that Blind could be out for up to six months. 

'It's not as bad as the doctors thought after the match,' the United boss said. 'It shall be a long story - but not six months or something. He has a brace on his knee. After 10 days' rest, he'll have another scan that will say more about the injury.'
