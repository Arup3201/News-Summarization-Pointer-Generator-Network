Former home secretary Alan Johnson has branded union leaders 'delusional' after they attacked Ed Miliband over his leadership of the Labour Party.

The MP backed the beleaguered Labour leader after senior figures vented their anger over his decision to embrace austerity measures, and suggested that financial support for the party could be withdrawn.

Unions affiliated to Labour have been fuming since shadow chancellor Ed Balls said that he would not promise to reverse Government cuts or lift the 1 per cent pay cap on public sector workers.

Unite leader Len McCluskey went public with his anger in a coded warning of a leadership coup, saying that Mr Miliband was setting Labour on course for electoral 'disaster' and undermining his own leadership.

And GMB general secretary Paul Kenny wrote to the union’s senior officials saying that Mr Balls’s speech could have a 'profound impact' on its relationship with the Labour Party.

But Mr Johnson - himself an ex-union general secretary - said Mr McCluskey’s intervention reminded him of a culture 'the movement had escaped'.

'According to Len, by trying to position Labour as a credible alternative to the coalition, Ed Miliband has set it on a path to "destruction",' the MP wrote in the Guardian.

'Stuck in a familiar groove, Len goes on to suggest that all the ills that he claims are befalling Labour are because of actions of so called "Blairites" - those terrible people who introduced the minimum wage and increased the number, the stature and indeed the pay of public sector workers across the country.'

He went on: 'Ed has stated a simple fact; that a Labour government will not be able to reverse as many of the cuts the current government is making unless it can show where the money is to come from.

'The difference between Len’s 
position and Ed’s is that Len believes a political party can win an 
election on a platform of promising no cuts, no job losses and continued
 levels of public expenditure. That is the policy of the delusional left
 who will never again win the public’s trust.

'The trade union movement lost its 
way in the late 1970s when it opposed the minimum wage and supported the
 closed shop. It needs to recognise that Ed Miliband’s vision of a 
better future requires a change of mindset throughout the party if we’re
 to spend one term in opposition rather than a decade.'

The GMB, another of Labour’s biggest 
donors, warned that Mr Miliband’s decision to accept the Government’s  
one per cent pay cap was a ‘serious  mistake’ and also indicated it 
could cut its traditional affiliation with his party.

The
 heads of Unite, the GMB, the PCS and the RMT joined forces to attack 
the Labour leader after Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls told a conference at 
the weekend the party was backing the pay cap for public sector workers 
and would retain it if returned to power.

Mr McCluskey said last night that there would be ‘real serious long-term implications’ if Labour is ‘dragged to the Right’.  

He
 added: ‘If Labour loses the next election I think there will be a 
serious rethink by a number of unions, including Unite, about our future
 relationships and the constitution of our political alliances.’

Earlier
 he complained the change of heart on a public sector pay freeze was ‘a 
victory for discredited Blairism at the expense of the party’s core 
supporters’. Mr McCluskey added: ‘It challenges the course Ed Miliband 
has set for the party, and perhaps his leadership itself.’

GMB
 general secretary Paul Kenny warned that Labour’s decision could have a
 ‘profound impact’. He said: ‘It is time for careful consideration on 
the long-term implications this new stance by the party has on GMB 
affiliation. This is the most serious mistake they could have made.’

Unions
 are responsible for 92 per cent of Labour funds. Since the election, 
Unite has given Labour £7.6million, while the GMB has handed over 
£2.6million. Last night Mr Balls admitted: ‘I don’t want the GMB or 
Unite to disaffiliate from the Labour Party. Of course I take the threat
 seriously.’

Mark Serwotka, the leader of the PCS, 
said Labour’s new stance ‘guarantees’ that Labour will lose the next 
election ‘and lose badly.’

RMT boss Bob Crow added: ‘Ed Miliband has 
jammed Labour’s self-destruct mission into top gear. This betrayal of 
millions of Labour’s core supporters sets him and his party on a one-way
 ticket to oblivion.’

But Mr Miliband hit back, saying: ‘I am not going 
to change my policy in the face of threats. I will not back down. I 
stand up for what’s right and if people don’t like it, that’s tough.’

Mr Miliband may have won the 
leadership battle with his brother David, but it seems his own deputy 
still has trouble getting the winner’s name right.

During an interview yesterday, Harriet
 Harman said: ‘Now we see David Cameron and Nick Clegg following 
Dav...Ed Miliband’s argument.’ However, her aides insisted that she was 
mistakenly referring to Mr Cameron.

 After
 being deemed 'too ugly' to become prime minister, Ed Miliband has been 
dealt another blow after it was revealed that 70 per cent of people 
don't believe in him.

The
 YouGov poll gives him his worst rating since winning the Labour 
leadership and a sure sign that supporters are turning away from him.

He received an overall rating of -3 points compared to David Cameron's 91 and Nick Clegg's 45 from Lib Dems.

Further
 rubbing salt into the wounds, most people said they believe his elder 
brother, David, would do a better job but he has ruled out standing 
again.
