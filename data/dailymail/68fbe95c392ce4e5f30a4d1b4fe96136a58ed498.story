Mary Galvin, 67, admitted taking the money from the two elderly women at Lyndon Residential Care Home

A former nurse stole thousands of pounds from vulnerable elderly women at the care home she managed, claiming they used heaters too much or owed her money for sleeping in a double bed.

Mary Galvin, 67, claimed she took the money from two residents at the Greater Manchester care home, which has now been closed, because she was told she had been undercharging then. 

She pilfered £3,000 from a 94-year-old woman because she felt she was using the heater excessively and that the pensioner owed her more because she was a single resident and slept in a single room.

Another woman had £3,500 taken directly from her bank account without being informed first

Bolton Crown Court heard that Galvin, who ran Lyndon Residential Care Home, had managed to take the money because she had direct access to residents' bank accounts to take their fees. 

Judge Timothy Stead said that by helping herself to the money Galvin had 'breached a high degree of trust.'

The problems started at the home in 2011 when nine deaths registered at the 16-bed residential home meant a loss of income and financial difficulties for Galvin. 

The home had to be sold after a police investigation into the thefts uncovered how Galvin had misused her access to the accounts. 

At Bolton Crown Court Galvin, of Whitefield, pleaded guilty to theft but escaped prison. The court heard Galvin and her husband bought the care home in 1997, after she had spent 30 years working as a nurse.

But Hugh Edwards, prosecuting, said Galvin had carried out the thefts after being given access to the residents' bank accounts in order to take their fees. He said the amounts taken were 'over and above what she was allowed to withdraw'.

Defending Galvin,  Philip Parry said she had been suffering mental health problems, following her son taking his own life in August 2012, and her daughter battling alcoholism. 

The court heard she had since paid back the money back in full to the two estates of the victims.

He added that the defendant was of fragile mentality and needs to see a psychiatrist. 

Mr Parry added: 'Mrs Galvin's use and misuse of bank accounts of two complainants was initially permitted. It wasn't a case where she helped herself to the money.

'The basis of the plea and the prosecution accepted, there was a time when both residents paid fees by cheque.'

But he added that there came a time when they didn't and Galvin was allowed to take the money.

'There was an agreement that allowed her to take the money for the accounts to the sum of the fees. The dishonesty accumulated over a year, the taking of money went beyond what she was permitted to take in lieu.'

Galvin was sentenced to 20 months in prison suspended for two years. She must also complete 100 hours unpaid work and pay £60 costs and a statutory victim surcharge of £100.

Judge Timothy Stead told her: 'I seriously hope that this is the last time you stand in the dock. What you did in stealing money from vulnerable persons in your care, you knew well to be wrong. As far as the courts are concerned the theft breached a high degree of trust.'  

After the case Labour Councillor Simon Carter who represents the Tottington ward said: 'I can't see how anybody should descend the conduct of running a care home like that and acting like that.

You have to build a business model and you have to predict the unpredictable, if there is a loss of income you don't start nicking money off residents you go to the bank.

'It's reprehensible. She was exploiting people who were clearly vulnerable. I imagine from what I read about social care it's not cheap. It's a serious breach of trust - you can't put a gloss on it - you can't tell it in any other way. I'm sorry it came to that but nobody made her do it.'
