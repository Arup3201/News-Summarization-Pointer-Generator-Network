New Hibernian boss Alan Stubbs has warned Rangers they won’t enjoy an easy passage back to Scottish football’s top flight.

The former Celtic defender, who Sportsmail understands is close to appointing former Everton coach Andy Holden as his No2, is facing up to the task of rebuilding a squad of just 15 senior players following the club’s relegation.

But he claims he has the resources to give Rangers and Hearts a run for their money in a cut-throat battle for promotion to the SPFL Premiership.

‘If you’re going on budgets then Rangers are favourites,’ said Stubbs. ‘But I’ve been around the block in football and you realise that’s not the be all and end all.

‘Our budget will be competitive for the league we’re in and we expect to give Rangers, Hearts and all the teams in the division a tough time.

‘It’s foolish to say it’s all about Rangers, Hibs and Hearts because it’s disrespectful to the  others.

‘It’s going to be a tough league - there’s no way we thought we were going to be in this league, but we are.

‘There’s no way Rangers thought they would be here and playing Hearts and Hibs this year in order to get up either. But those who think it’s a foregone conclusion are mistaken.’

An Old Firm foe of Ally McCoist during his time at Parkhead, Stubbs, 42, is relishing the thought of locking horns once more.

‘We’ve come across each other a few times, more out in Glasgow than anything.

‘I’ve
 had conversations with Coisty a few times and we’ve met at coaching 
events and games so there will be a bit of banter on the sidelines - but
 most of all there will be a respect.’

As
 he fields calls from agents for players Stubbs is also seeking to firm 
up the appointment of an assistant. Former Welsh international Holden, 
51, is the man he wants after ex-Everton colleague David Unsworth opted 
to stay put.

Stubbs hopes to name his assistant by Monday at the latest.

‘We’ll have a discussion with (chief executive) Leeann Dempster today and I am virtually certain come Monday you will have a name to write about,’ he said.

Announcing bookmakers Marathonbet as the new club sponsor in a six-figure deal, Dempster insisted she had been tracking the progress of Stubbs for some time.

Former Falkirk managing director George Craig will help Stubbs out in a director of football type role and Dempster insists the cash is there to rebuild a squad decimated by the axing of 12 players.

‘We are in the Championship, so there is a reality in terms of the income we can generate but we will have a good budget in this division in comparison to the competitors,’ she said.

‘I won’t make the budget public, but it is strong and there is money to bring players in. It is up to us to spend wisely and be absolutely committed to getting the right players in.

‘But today is not about talking about money, it’s about introducing Alan to the supporters at large - looking forward rather than backwards.’
