This is the moment a professional cyclist proposed to his long-term girlfriend just minutes after finishing a track race at the Commonwealth Games – and punched the air in delight when she said yes.

Scotland’s Chris Pritchard, 31, was still dressed in his lycra cycling gear when he got down on one knee to pop the question to Amanda Ball in front of a cheering crowd, which included the Earl and Countess of Wessex.

Having just finished ninth overall in the men’s keirin at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow, Pritchard shocked the mother of his child when he clambered up into the stands and asked her to marry him.

The Sheffield-born cyclist asked Miss Ball to marry him as she stood in the stands holding their baby boy Milo

The romantic gesture was met by rapturous applause from the shocked crowd, who cheered as Pritchard put the ring on his partner's finger

After getting the answer he wanted, Pritchard threw both arms into the air to celebrate his victory

The romantic gesture was met by rapturous applause from the shocked crowd, who watched as the Sheffield-born cyclist put the diamond ring on his fiancé’s finger as she held their baby boy Milo.

The proposal came just minutes after the competitor cycled over to where Miss Ball was sitting in the stands, having just crossed the finishing line in a ride-off to decide the final standings.

After punching the air in celebration, Pritchard posed for photographs with his delighted partner, who could be heard saying ‘I’m shaking’.

He later confirmed he kept the proposal secret from everyone - including his teammates - so as to make the biggest impact.

‘I couldn't tell anybody,’ he said. ‘I didn't want it to get out. It was top secret.’

The professional cyclist said a ‘lot of hard work’ went into the proposal, which he said he had been planning for up to six months.

However, despite knowing what was about to come, the athlete said he didn't let it stop him focusing on his race.

‘That was pushed to the back of the head,’ he said. ‘I hoped she was going to say yes. I thought, “She's going to say yes, she's going say yes, so I can put that away”.

‘And I thought about what was going on in the keirin. It was a really good keirin. I really enjoyed it.’ 

The proposal seemed to delight the cheering crowd, which included the Earl of Wessex, Prince Edward (front right), the Countess of Wessex (top left) and their daughter Lady Louise Windsor (centre)

Sophie, Countess of Wessex even took to her binoculars to get a closer look of the proposal

The Countess, dressed in cream suit, clapped and smiled in delight as she watched the couple get engaged 

Miss Ball said she was stunned by Pritchard's actions, insisting the proposal had come out of the blue.

‘I was like, “Oh my God - why is he climbing over the bars? What is he going to do?”. I didn't think he was going to propose’ she said.

Showing off her engagement ring, though, she admitted: ‘I've been nagging for long enough. It's just like the one I took a picture of and left on the iPad!’

Amanda Ball said she didn't expect the proposal but had no hesitation in saying yes to her long-term partner

The proposal also seemed to delight the cheering crowd, which included the Earl of Wessex, Prince Edward, and his wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex – who even took to her binoculars to get a closer look.

And it wasn't just Pritchard who made a romantic gesture at this year’s Commonwealth Games.

Para-sport sprint B2 1,000m time-trial tandem silver medallist Aileen McGlynn also reportedly got engaged to her partner, Graeme, after he popped the question.
