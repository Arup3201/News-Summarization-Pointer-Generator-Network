Workers aged 50 and over are the biggest  losers in the latest  jobless figures.

Every day between September and November around 1,300 Britons joined the growing army of those  without work.

The picture is only likely to get worse over the coming months and it is older workers who are paying the heaviest price, with unemployment  rising faster among this group than any other.

Out of work: An unemployed man walks into a jobcentre to collect benefits, as today the total number of jobless soars to 2.68 million

The figures, published  yesterday by the Office for National Statistics, show unemployment among those age 50 and above has hit a 17-year high of 432,000.

The overall jobless total of 2.69million is also at a 17-year high.

Of the 118,000 who became unemployed during the three-month period, 40 per cent are in the over-50 age group.

Experts warn it is very difficult, if not impossible, for a worker in their 50s or 60s to find another job paying the same salary. Many never work again. To make matters worse, they are losing  their jobs at a time when the Government is increasing  the State pension age, which means their retirement date is being postponed.

David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashed at Prime Minister's Questions today over the latest grim figure

Dr Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, the old age experts, said: ‘Once they have lost their job it is almost like their life is over, but it is far too early for this to happen.

‘They want to work and they need to work, but many cannot find a job ever again.

‘There are people who apply for hundreds of jobs but keep on being told they are far too experienced, which is a euphemism for being too old.’

Pressure: Chancellor George Osborne will face calls to revive the economy with jobs creation

Overall, the ONS figures yesterday painted a bleak picture of a jobs market – and it is only likely to get worse.

The number of unemployed women hit an all-time high of 1.13million, the largest number since records began in 1992.

Youth unemployment also broke records. More than one in five of those between the age of 16 and 24 are unemployed, hitting a total of 1.04million.

Ministers insist this figure is misleading because it includes 313,000 full-time students who may, for example, be unable to get a part-time bar job to subsidise their studies.

Full-time jobs are disappearing rapidly, with record numbers forced to work part-time.

There are 1.3million part-time workers who are in this trap which is, again, the highest number since records began.

The number of full-time employees plunged by 140,000 between September and November, while the number of part-time employees jumped by 31,000.

Thousands of people every day are being forced into becoming self-employed, because they cannot find a job.

The national unemployment rate has risen to 8.4 per cent over the last quarter

Despite a slight drop a year earlier, the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance now stands at 1.6 million

Region/ Total unemployed /Change on quarter/ Unemployment rate

North East, 153,000, plus 11,000, 12%

North West, 307,000, plus, 25,000, 8.9%

Yorkshire/Humber, 270,000, plus 11,000, 10.1%

East Midlands, 190,000, plus 7,000, 8.3%

West Midlands, 243,000, plus 9,000, 9.2%

East, 220,000, plus 18,000, 7.2%

London, 424,000, minus 1,000, 9.9%

South East, 284,000, plus 27,000, 6.4%

South West, 175,000, minus 1,000, 6.5%

Wales, 130,000, minus 1,000, 8.9%

Scotland, 231,000, plus 19,000, 8.6%

N Ireland, 59,000, minus 7,000, 6.8%

There are 4.1million self-employed, 
which the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said includes
many ‘part-time odd-jobbers desperate to avoid unemployment’.

Dr John Philpott, chief economic 
adviser, said: ‘The picture remains one of increasing fragility. The 
jobs situation is set to get much worse in 2012.’

Nida Ali, economic adviser  to the accountant Ernst & Young’s Item Club, predicts unemployment, currently 2.69million, will hit three million by spring next year.

This would be close to one in ten of the economically active population – workers and those looking for work. In the North-East, it has already hit 12 per cent.

Yesterday the Prime Minister said unemployment was ‘a tragedy’ for each of the victims, which can lead to ‘real difficulty’ for their families.

He described the rise in unemployment as ‘hugely unwelcome’, and said the Government must move ‘further and faster’ to help the private sector create jobs.

For those who keep their jobs, the squeeze on their living standards remains.

The ONS said the average pay rise in the private sector is 2 per cent, compared to inflation of 4.2 per cent.
