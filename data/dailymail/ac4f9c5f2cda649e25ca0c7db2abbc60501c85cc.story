A fan has spent hours painstakingly recreating the new Star Wars trailer shot-for-shot... with Lego.

The first official glimpse of the highly anticipated Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens was released yesterday.

And YouTube user Snooperking, a self-taught video editor, worked round the clock to build the sets and props, including the Millennium Falcon, uploading his version  just 14 hours after the 88-second teaser was released.

Mimic: A fan has spent hours painstakingly recreating the new Star Wars trailer shot-for-shot on YouTube... with Lego. Pictured, new cast member John Boyega races across a desert landscape as a Stormtrooper

Spot the difference: The enthusiast built a desert set using yellow lego and  a figurine to replicate Boyega

Accompanying his clip the U.S. fan, who has created several similar videos, said he was 'excited for the movie'.

He wrote: 'I had nothing to do yesterday so I started once the trailer came out.

'I built the Falcon, The X-Wing, the speeder bike thingy, a mini tie fighter, tried to build all the sets, and get all my mini figures put together.

'Then just filming took forever especially the  special effects.

'I tried stop motion in front of the green screen and that was hard and by this time it was 3am so like more than 12 hours (I took a three hour break somewhere) and then finally gave up and used sewing string for the X-Wing and just kind of moved my camera around the Falcon. 

'I wasn't as happy with the Falcon shot but I cant work on it at all today, so I had to finish it like four hours ago.

'Now you know everything about how it was made!'

On the move: A futuristic robot, similar to the one featured in Abrams' Bad Robot production company logo, urgently races across the desert

Uncanny: A ball is rolled to imitate the robot and Lego bricks have been substituted for  background machines

Here they come: The Stormtroopers are on the attack in the forthcoming seventh instalment of the franchise

Copy: Luckily, Lego sell Stormtrooper figurines - which were lined up to recreate this shot

Opening some 30 years after Return of the Jedi, the teaser kicks off with British actor John Boyega racing across a desert landscape dressed in full Stormtrooper regalia. 

While returning cast members Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are absent from the montage, fans are given a first look at the younger generation of cast members to feature in this, the first of three planned sequels.   

A parched, disembodied voice tells us of an 'awakening' and reminds us of the dual energies that are 'the dark side... and the light.' 

British actress Daisy Ridley is the next new star to appear as she drives a hover vehicle towards a desert town, while Oscar Isaac is seen as a fighter pilot, looking rather like a young Luke Skywalker when he's headed for the Death Star. 

The trailer also delivers what was initially suggested during the forthcoming film's development - a clear departure from the over-indulgent use of CGI that blighted parts one, two and three of the science fiction saga. 

New face: Brit Daisy Ridley - a virtual unknown prior to her casting - also features in the new trailer

Lady Lego: A female figure is used as Daisy Ridley's character, who is rumoured to play Han Solo and Princess Leia's adult daughter in the new film

Remote: Ridley races across a desolate homestead on what appears to be desert planet Tattoine

Sandy: The yellow set makes a reappearance for this shot of Ridley racing off in a hovering contraption

It also confirms the welcome return of the iconic Millennium Falcon, and it is seen dodging laser blasts in a brief battle sequence. 

A new lightsaber makes its debut, complete with a sword-like hilt, as an ominous cloaked figure marauds through a dark, snow-layered forest setting.

With a fresh outlook, a young, visionary director and the return of its original stars, anticipation has been steadily building  since wheels started turning on plans to add three further Star Wars films.

The result of an ambitious $4.05 billion buyout that saw Disney acquire complete autonomy over the franchise from LucasFilm in November 2012, the JJ Abrams-directed Episode VII is their first offering as they endeavour to build on the universe originally devised by George Lucas in the mid-70s.

The coup followed similar buyouts from Pixar ($7.4bn) and Marvel ($4.2bn) with Disney unveiling plans to release a further three episodic films and an additional standalone film every two or three years - a reaction to 'pent-up demand' from fans. 

Ready for take off: Oscar Isaac is seen in an X-Wing pilot jumpsuit as he prepares for battle

Identical: The Lego version mimics Isaac's appearance in the teaser, complete with hand movements

Thrilling: X-Wings race past a mountainous backdrop in another brief action shot from JJ Abrams' new film

'Snooperking' confessed the special effects took forever and he wasn't completely happy with the results

With a proven pedigree in TV and film, Lost creator Abrams signed up to direct the first after initially ruling himself out.

Directly responsible for redefining and reinvigorating the Star Trek franchise, Abrams' decision made him the first director to work across two rival universes. 

A further coup, the return of original cast-members Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in their respective career-defining roles as Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia further whetted the appetite. 

Anthony Daniels (C3PO), Kenny Baker (R2D2) and Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) were also confirmed, with all three having previously featured in the Lucas directed prequel series depicting the rise of Darth Vader and ultimate fall of the Jedi counsel.

New additions include Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domnhall Gleeson, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and legendary Swedish actor Max Van Sydow – best known for his role as Father Lankester Merrin in 1973 shocker The Exorcist.

Welcome back: The Millennium Falcon makes a fleeting return in the maddeningly short first teaser trailer

Painstaking: And it was quickly built by Snooperking, who moved his camera around it to recreate the shot

The old enemy: While Han Solo is absent from the new trailer, his beloved Falcon is at the heart of the action

New replica: The enthusiast said he 'wasn't as happy with the Falcon shot but I cant work on it at all today'

Actress Lupita Nyong’o also signed up for a role in the forthcoming film after winning praise for her Academy Award winning role in 12 Years A Slave, telling fans: ‘I’m going to a galaxy far, far away.’

Meanwhile Girls star Adam Driver hinted that he is poised to play a villain in episode VII after co-star Lena Dunham told him to ‘rip a hole in da force’ in a congratulatory tweet posted shortly after his casting.

Much like the original trilogy, released between 1977 and 1983,  the bulk of principal photography took place at Buckinghamshire’s Pinewood Studios, with additional location shoots taking place in Ireland and Abu Dhabi - where filming began in June.

The dusty set suggested desert planet Tattooine was set to feature, and early shots indicated that Abrams was keen to move away from the heavily digitised prequels that provided a back story to the original trilogy, opting instead move away from the blue screen techniques favoured by Lucas in favour of traditional sets.

The new trailer will play in 30 selected cinemas across the United States from Friday until Sunday November 30 - after which it will screen in cinemas across the globe. 

Star Wars: Episode VII: The Force Awakens goes on general release nationwide on December 15, 2015.

As Star Wars fans eagerly prepared for the release of Abrams' 88-second trailer the internet became awash with spoof teasers. Ranging from the authentic to the downright absurd, each is reliant on clever editing techniques, computer graphics and a fast-paced montage of shots from the first six films. 

Bold graphics, a clear narrative and the use of Abrams' own Bad Robot production company logo make this one of the more believable teasers to emerge in the build up to Friday's release. It had many fooled, but the 90 second teaser is a cleverly constructed montage comprised of footage from the previous six films and spin off games. 

 

Somewhat less plausible, this fake once again draws from existing footage, but also cheekily steals a shot of Harrison Ford from 2013 science fiction adventure Enders Game. It's impressive, but not particularly convincing. 

 

Poorly executed and awash with rich animation commonly associated with the prequels released by LucasFilm between 1999 and 2005. Whatever narrative it attempts to convey is undermined by  the use of old fashioned graphics. 

 

Crumbling planets, vengeful Jedi warriors and a galaxy at war makes this another engaging addition to the array of fakes finding their way onto the internet in the run up to Friday's official trailer release.
