Millions of employees in a workplace pension scheme are to be freed from punitive curbs on savings imposed by Brussels.

Earners were limited to £4,600 a year in contributions as part of the government-backed National Employment Savings Trust (NEST).

They were also barred from transferring old company pensions into the scheme or taking it with them if they moved jobs.

Pensions Minister Steve Webb (pictured) said: 'By convincing Europe to support us on this, we’ve achieved a victory for consumers' 

But after a year of negotiation, the European Commission has agreed to lift the restrictions in a ‘victory’ for employees, ministers will announce today. 

Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: ‘This is a common sense decision which will help people to save and give certainty and confidence to employers choosing to use NEST.

‘By convincing Europe to support us on this, we’ve achieved a victory for consumers.’

However, savers will have to wait until April 1, 2017 for the changes to kick in. The low-cost, not-for-profit pension was designed for small businesses and low to moderate earners who could not afford to pay into more expensive company pensions.

More than 1.5million workers have joined since 2012 – and the figure is expected to reach four million in the next three years. The European Commission imposed restrictions because of fears that a state-funded pension scheme could distort or threaten competition from private pension firms.

Frances O’Grady, general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ‘great news for savers’

Mr Webb said it had put many businesses off because it would have meant running two parallel pensions – one for higher earners and NEST for low-income staff.

Relaxing the rules meant workers could avoid having ‘pensions scattered all over the place’, which risked people losing track of their savings, he said.

The move comes after pressure from union and employer groups, the National Association of Pension Funds, NEST and criticism from MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee.

Frances O’Grady, general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ‘great news for savers’.

‘It was always ridiculous that people could not save as much as they wanted into NEST,’ she added.

Mr Webb defended the 2017 deadline, saying Parliament was ‘littered’ with legislation that had been rushed through and blamed the delay on lengthy consultations with the pension industry and Eurocrats.

NEST was introduced alongside automatic enrolment, which forces every boss to pay into a pension for workers who are over 22 and earn at least £10,000 by 2018.
