A millionaire pharmaceuticals entrepreneur deliberately gave her eight-year-old son a lethal dose of prescription drugs and exchanged goodbyes but later tried to revive him, she told jurors on Thursday.

Gigi Jordan told her murder trial she heard her son, Jude Mirra, struggling to breathe: 'My heart started pounding,' she testified.

'I raced over to him. I was crying and sobbing,' she said. 'I was crying and calling, 'Jude! Jude! Jude!' And then I started to attempt CPR.'

Mother's confession: Gigi Jordan, right, pictured in court in 2011 with her attorney Alan Dershowitz told jurors on Thursday that she gave her son a lethal dose of painkillers but tried to revive him afterwards

Her tearful account provided a stark contrast to the prosecution's portrayal of her as a dark woman coolly killing her only son.

Jude was found dead of a drug overdose in a pill-strewn, deluxe Manhattan hotel room in February 2010, with Jordan on the floor. Emergency responders' accounts of her condition have varied from incoherent to composed.

Jordan says she set out to take her life and her son's for a complex set of reasons: Some ominous occurrences had convinced her that one of her ex-husbands would have her killed to keep her from raising allegations of financial malfeasance, and she felt that without her Jude would be unable to avoid a man she says sexually abused him.

'I couldn't see any way out of the situation,' she said.

Both men have denied her allegations. Neither has been charged with any crime.

Mother and son: Prosecutors maintain Jordan (right), 54, forced a cocktail of crushed pills and vodka with orange juice down the throat of her eight-year-old son, Jude Mirra (left), in a $2,300-a-night hotel suite 

Standing trial: As Jude (right) lay dying on the bed next to her, Jordan (pictured, left, in court) then reportedly emailed adviser Patrick Walsh, saying: 'Hi Pat, can you please wire $125,000 to Bruce as requested below?'

Prosecutors say Jordan had no right to kill Jude, whatever her reasoning.

They say Jordan climbed on top of her son and pried his mouth open — so forcefully that she left bruises on his face and chest — and plunged a deadly combination of painkillers, other drugs, vodka and orange juice down his throat with a syringe.

Then she got on her computer and transferred money out of her son's trust fund, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos has said. She also wrote a suicide note.

The nonverbal, often tormented-seeming Jude was initially deemed autistic but later was diagnosed with immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, according to Jordan.

Aim: Jordan hoped to siphon cash from her son's trust into one of her business accounts, prosecutors said

Scene of the crime: Although Jordan has never disputed feeding the drugs to Jude, she has described her actions in the luxury hotel room on Fifth Avenue as a 'mercy killing'. Above, the Peninsula on Fifth Avenue

Devastating: Prosecutors said the pharmaceutical executive's emails contradicted her  lawyer's assertions that she was 'emotionally distraught' at her son's autism. Above, emergency crews take away Jude's body

Allegations: In addition to his medical condition, Jordan alleges that her son's (pictured) biological father, and her second husband, Emil Tzekov, had been sexually abusing the boy since he was an infant

Nonetheless, she says, Jude disclosed the abuse to her with gestures, his few words and, later, by typing on computers in a technique known as facilitated communication, with her touching his arm.

Various authorities rebuffed her requests to investigate the abuse allegation, she said. 

One of her inquiries instead ended with her hospitalized for a psychological examination in 2008. She was released within days.

During their last weeks together, she said on Thursday, Jude tapped out messages supporting her plan to kill them both. And on the final night, 'Jude and I were typing to each other and saying goodbye to each other,' she said.

She denied forcing the drugs down his throat and said the bruises reflect her effort to revive him.
