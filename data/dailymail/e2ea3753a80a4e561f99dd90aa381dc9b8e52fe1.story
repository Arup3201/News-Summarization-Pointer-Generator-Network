A Christian couple who were sued after refusing to allow a gay couple to stay in a double room at their seaside guesthouse will be legally allowed to turn away unmarried couples after becoming an non-profit organisation.

Peter and Hazelmary Bull found themselves at the centre of an international furore after telling civil partners Martyn Hall and Steven Preddy that they could not share a room at the Chymorvah Hotel in Marazion, Cornwall, on account of their religious beliefs.

But now they will be able to turn away unmarried gay and straight couples from the Bed & Breakfast, which doubles up as their home, after becoming a not-for-profit organisation.

Fined: B&B owners Peter and Hazelmary Bull, who were fined for breaching equality laws by refusing to let a gay couple share a room at their guesthouse, will be legally able to turn away unmarried couples after deciding to become a non-profit organisation

Mr and Mrs Bull were forced to pay £3,600 to the couple in a landmark case in 2011 after they were found to have discriminated against them on the grounds of sexual orientation under Equality Act regulations.

The couple insisted that their policy of not allowing unmarried couples to share a bed extended to heterosexual couples as well as homosexual pairs.

But the courts disagreed.

The hotel is now to be turned into a respite care centre for Christians and anyone staying under their roof will now have to abide by the Bull's rules as long as they are set out in the company's articles.

The Bulls have since taken their case to the Court of Appeal, where it was dismissed and have now had permission to have it heard in the country’s highest court, the Supreme Court.

Mrs Bull, 69, said the incident had changed their lives.

She said: 'We have been through the mill since 2008. It has stepped up since the trial.

'In 2010, when the trial happened it was given a lot of press attention because it was a precedent and also dealt with quite a touchy subject. Most people have quite strong feelings one way or another.

'We are not fanatics. We have often been portrayed as being bigoted.

'I am not homophobic. I have no problem with them - I have always thought of them as people and enjoy their company. It is just that we thought it would be wrong for here.

'It had nothing to do with homophobia.

'All the way through we have always said no unmarried couples; it just happens that homosexuals fit into that category ... it is a terribly difficult subject.'

The Chymorvah has been struggling to attract guests since the Equalities Act was brought in 2007, meaning they are no longer able to be rated by Visit England because of their policies and therefore are unable to advertise in many of the guides that used to bring in the majority of their customers.

Mrs Bull says that the recession has added to financial difficulties and she has hope for the future.

She added: 'We have come through two and a half years now and we are coming into a new chapter in that we are revamping this place and relaunching it.'

Not only have visitor numbers declined, but Mrs Bull says that the couple have had death threats and sufferered vandalism.

But she said that messages of support have far outweighed any negative correspondence since their day in court.

She said: 'All we wanted was to be able to support marriage, to say no here.

'This (the result of the trial) is the men’s human rights and they come into a collision with our human rights.

'Nobody ever thought it through when this legislation was first brought in.

'Can’t somebody work out a formula that keeps them happy and us?'

To try to encourage more people to stay, the Bulls are trying to innovate.

The first event they have planned is an educational supper on the Jewish festival of Passover for Christians next Friday.

They will also be offering branch line breaks from June, where visitors will be offered guided tours of the five branch lines in Cornwall.

Mrs Bull said she hoped it would attract rail enthusiasts.

As for the legal battle, the Bulls won permission in August to take their case to the Supreme Court and their case is set to be heard on October 9 and 10.

The Bull's appeal will be heard at the Supreme Court in October.
