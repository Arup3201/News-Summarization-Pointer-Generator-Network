Sarah Jessica Parker took her eponymous shoe line to a familiar location this week: the New York City townhouse that Sex and the City fans will recognize as Carrie Bradshaw's longtime home.

Carrie's stoop, located on Perry St in the West Village, served as a backdrop for a photo shoot with Ms Parker's 'Carrie' shoe, displayed in various colors.

The 49-year-old shared a few Instagram snaps of the special occasion.

'It was take your @sjpcollection shoes to work day. #longdayforCarrie #whewwwwthosesteps #runninginheels #taxi!' she captioned the first image, which shows her sitting on the stoop arranging the pumps while sporting a black wide-brimmed hat and cuffed jeans.

'That's a wrap ladies,' she wrote alongside a second photo of the footwear on the steps to the residence, which is actually in Manhattan's West Village though Carrie was said to live on the Upper East Side.

She posted a third picture of the shoes, lined up neatly in a row, writing: 'Oh no. Eek. Sorry. No. I was just talking about the shoes. Oh man. Geesh. Sorry. X Sj'

The actress seemed to be clarifying that her first post was not referring to work on a third Sex and the City movie, which is rumored to be in the works.

When asked about the possibility of a third film installment, Jennifer Hudson - who appeared in the first SATC movie in 2008 - recently told Dish Nation: 'I think it might be [happening]. Somebody just came to me talking about that. So if it’s in the talks, it might happen. So look for it.'

Ms Parker added to the fan frenzy when she hinted that a third project is underway in a Twitter exchange with Kristin Davis earlier this week.

Ms Parker launched her first SJP shoe collection exclusively at Nordstrom in February, releasing her second one in August.

The line was developed with the help of Manolo Blahnik CEO George Malkemus.

'It’s unlike any other collaboration I’ve ever been a part of. It’s crazy, crazy simple in a way because we have lots and lots of ideas, our points of references are really similar. We didn’t realize but we have a short hand that’s really fun,' she told The Washingtonian.
