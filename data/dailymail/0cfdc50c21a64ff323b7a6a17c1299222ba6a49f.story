There are faster ways to get a message to someone, but there's something enchanting about the way one New York teenager delivered a note to its recipient.

Connor Corbett-Rice, 15, from Shelter Island, tossed a bottle into the Atlantic Ocean near his home in 2011, as part of school project.

Three years later, he received a much faster reply - by email.

Cast away: The bottle was sent out to see off the Long Island coastline at Shelter Island, New York

Roundabout route: Because of the way ocean currents flow, it's thought the bottle may have headed over towards Europe before floating back westwards towards the Bahamas

'I forgot about the entire project,' Connor, told the New York Post. 'I imagined where it would be found, but I never imagined the Bahamas.'

The bottle came ashore more than 1,000 nautical miles from where it drifted off in New York.

It was found by Andrew and Carol Gracie, who live in the Bahamas.

They were out walking on a private island when they came across the bottle. The couple say they are avid Beachcombers always looking for unusual treasure.

'At first I surmised it to have been thrown from a passing cruise ship recently,” Andrew Gracie told the 'Post.

Sending out an SOS: The bottle was thrown into the Atlantic at Shelter Island, New York in May 2011 - it came ashore in the Bahamas almost three years later, 1,000 miles away

'Halfway along the first crescent I immediately spotted a large clear bottle with notes inside,' said Mr Gracie.  'After reading the note, we emailed Connor and Jack Reardon detailing how and where we found the bottle. Needless to say, they were astounded to get our email.'

The note read: 'My name is Connor. I live on Shelter Island. It is a small Island in between the two forks of Long Island, which extend out from New York City about 100 miles east. Our year-round population is about 2,500 people, but in  the summer we have a lot more tourists and summer people who only have summer homes out here . . I have a younger brother named Mitchell. He is 8. I also have a younger sister named Angelina. She is 5. My dog is a puggle named Boo. Write back.'

Connor says he was shocked to receive a response. 'I wouldn’t have believed it,' he said.

What makes the discovery all the more remarkable is that the bottle arrived in a location that ocean currents do not usually flow towards from where it was dropped.

Currents from New York also tend to move in a northerly direction rather than south.

It means throwing an item off the New York coastline make Canada, Greenland, Iceland or Europe a more likely point of arrival.

Connor's teacher, Jack Reardon, says he has been assigning the project for nine years but has never had a bottle come from so far south.

'I didn't even believe it when these folks contacted me,' Mr Reardon said. 'I usually will get a response to the bottles within 24 hours from what I presume to be just pleasure boaters going by. The farthest response has been from Rhode Island, which isn't very far. I've never had a response come back from a legitimate far off distance.

What a journey: The bottle ended up here in the Bahamas in what some believe could have been a 10,000 mile round trip

I think the bottle made a long, long clockwise journey and some westward moving storm blew it up on the beach where they found it.'

Stormy weather could have contributed to the unusual currents, Mr. Reardon said.

Connor speculated the bottle could have been drifting on that northern route when currents from Superstorms Sandy or Irene might have interceded with its trajectory.

Mr Gracie also believes the bottle believes it may have taken a roundabout route to end up in the Bahamas.

'I can only surmise that there must have been a very strong outgoing tide to carry the bottle far enough out to reach the Gulf Stream' Mr. Gracie said.

While no one will ever know the course the bottle took, he speculated that it might have traveled north past Nova Scotia, then easterly, just south of Iceland, then south past Scotland and Ireland and farther south towards the Canary

Islands where the currents could have carried it west toward the southern Bahamas.

In the weeks since the bottle has been found, there there have been several emails between Connor and the Gracies.

They told the Shelter Island Reporter they hope Connor’s experience with his message in a bottle will inspire other students.

'In today’s world of instant communication, emails, Short Message Service and Facebook, it’s great to hear that some of our teachers are still able to successfully stimulate our youth with some old-fashioned classroom experiments that will further stimulate them to seek answers to time-honored questions,' Mr. Gracie said.

'We will always need navigators, explorers, meteorologists, oceanographers and the like and it is this type of simple stimulation that our teachers can achieve with today’s youth,' he said.
