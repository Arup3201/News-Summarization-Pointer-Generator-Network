Hollywood legend Gregory Peck’s stately California residence of 30 years is up for sale for 24.999 million.

The French chateau-style home, set back from the rush of Los Angeles, was the long-time home of Peck and his philanthropist wife, Veronique, who passed away in 2012.

During the time he lived in the house, the famous actor appeared in numerous films and television shows, including the miniseries, Moby Dick, for which he won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in 1998.

He also appeared in films including Cape Fear, Boys from Brazil and MacArthur.

The palatial residence was built in 1932 and measures 9,000 square feet.

It has seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms and a mix of formal and casual living spaces, all with large windows opening out to the landscaped park-like grounds and swimming pool.

Listing agent Jade Mills of Coldwell Banker Previews International said it is her ‘45 minutes of tranquility during a busy day’.

‘[The house ] is almost like being far out in the country on your own 1.3 acres of secluded paradise,’ she said.

‘However, you’re only minutes from the city’s best shops, restaurants and hot spots. I absolutely love showing this property.’

The home on 539 S. Mapleton Dr is co-listed with Jeff Hyland and Rayni Romito of Hilton & Hyland.
