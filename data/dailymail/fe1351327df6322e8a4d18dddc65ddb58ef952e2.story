It was the moment when the oldest female hostage, being held inside the Lindt chocolate cafe for hours by a crazed gunman, had enough and confronted her captor because 'no one else had'.

Mother and daughter were part of the Nine Network's television special on Sunday, recounting the ordeals of eight survivors: Paolo Vassallo, Harriette Denny, Joel Herat, Jarrod Morton-Hoffman, Fiona Ma, Selina Win Pe, Louisa Hope and Robin Hope.

When quizzed about her confrontation with Man Monis, Robin, 72, told Liz Hayes on the Nine Network's siege special 'I just thought no-one else had (stood up to him) and I thought, well, I will have a go'.

'I just wanted to let him know that I wasn't impressed with what he was choosing to do with all of our lives.'

Throughout their ordeal, the pair knew they would be unable to escape his clutches, with Louisa confined to the use of a walking stick.

'That's right. I'm not exactly able to run and my mother is elderly, so you know, reality, our reality was was that we really did have to wait for the police to come,' she said on the 60 Minutes program.

The 72-year-old said to him: 'I just don't like your attitude. It's not an attitude of how we run. We don't need this. We come in here for refreshments.'

The hostage-taker then turned to Louisa and said: 'Louisa, keep your mother quiet.'

But she would not and was determined to be heard by Monis.

'I want to go to the bathroom and my daughter needs her medication,' she told him and for a moment, he seemed to relent, offering to allow Louisa to take her medication.

But then his mood shifts again and he focuses on the barrister Stefan Balafoutis, who he came to refer to as 'white shirt'.

'You, white shirt man, no talking,' he demanded.

A short time later Mr Balafoutis would follow John O'Brien out the door, the first two taken hostage, to escape.

John O"Brien and Stefan Balafoutis were the first hostages to escape the clutches of Man Monis 

But there would be no escape for the mother and daughter. 

They were left inside, sitting with Tori Johnson. As the last group ran, Louisa remembers: 'I heard a bang and I looked up and I opened my eyes and they were all gone. Now, in the moment, in that moment, I assumed that the police had come. I didn't realise that they had escaped. Then, I saw the door and I went it's time to go.'

But she couldn't.

'I stood up from my chair and went forward,' she said.

'But at the same time, went but mum's not coming and Tori, why are they not moving? In that moment, I went I can't go.

'You know, I can't go. I can't leave mum here. So what am I going to do? So I just laid down on the floor. I laid down face first and put my hands above my head, on the floor, and waited.'

She had seen Jarrod Hoffman and Joel Herat lead the group of six out.

'Oh yes, and I also tried to encourage Tori to go. He is seated directly beside me.'

Louisa couldn't explain why she and Tori didn't try to get out.

'Well, it was all so quick, you know,' she said.

'Look, truly, unless you are in the room, the experience of the quickness of the end was unreal.

'He came out and he was leaning over me and shouting "Why are you there? Why are you there?" and he grabbed me then by the - by my back, by my bra strap and hauled me up and I'm trying to get up and I'm saying "I'm trying. I'm trying".

'He drags me over to the middle of the room and says "You stand here. You stand here" and then "No, no, you sit here. No you stand here. "

'Then he calls me. He calls "You" and indicates to mum. Pulls her out. And he's hyper by this stage and he is anxious and, you know, alert and, you know, he has got his gun and he you know, he has got his gun and he - he is directing us and pushing us and, you know, you here.

'And you to this side and me to the other side and he is spinning. And the back pack that he's wearing that supposedly had the bomb in it is moving and knocking me and probably knocking mum as well. And so it is all kind of go, go, go. And then, he says to Tori, he says "You" and he calls him over and says - says "Neil down" and, um, "Put your hands on your head".

'But what I heard was him then going back and saying "Get down on your knees. Get down on your knees". And time was just ticking, ticking, ticking again. I didn't know who was left.

'Tori, um, knelt down. And he was sobbing. And then the gunman scanning the room. And looking, he is expecting the police to come in the front door, seems to be blind that the back door is there and open. So he's looking for the police to come in the front and he's got the gun up high, holding it high and he's scanning and moving around and shuffling.

'And then his demeanour completely changes. It's like he's suddenly, like, steels himself, like suddenly goes very firm and very hard and very absolute in his body and feeling.

'And then he shoots Tori. So from the time that Tori was told to kneel, was some minutes. I can't remember how long those minutes or seconds were. But it wasn't immediate. It was time enough for Tori to steady his heart and then he shot him.'
