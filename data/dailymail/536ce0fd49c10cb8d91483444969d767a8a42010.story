Conor McGregor vs Steve O'Keeffe Cage Warriors 45

After four straight victories in 2011, McGregor began the following year with a bang against O'Keeffe in London. 

The Irishman started like a freight train, landing with hands and knees before surviving a takedown attempt. 

As O'Keeffe continued his bid to drag McGregor to the canvas, he came under attack from a barrage of elbows and the referee quickly stepped in.

McGregor's win over O'Keeffe earned him a shot at the vacant featherweight title in front of his home crowd in Dublin. 

The then 23-year-old was in top position on the canvas in the first round and launched a vicious attack. Hill survived but was taken down again before the end of the session. 

A head kick in the second round set up what proved to be the decisive move as McGregor executed a rear-naked choke to win the belt.

Conor McGregor vs Ivan Buchinger Cage Warriors 51

Six months after winning the featherweight crown, McGregor was back in Dublin looking to add the lightweight title to his collection. 

Slovakian Ivan Buchinger stood in the way of McGregor creating history by becoming the first fighter in the organisation to hold two belts simultaneously. 

And he did it in style in the opening round, knocking Buchinger out with a stunning left. That would prove to be McGregor's final outing with Cage Warriors as he made the move to the UFC.
