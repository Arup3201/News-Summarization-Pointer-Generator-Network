Dropped the case: The court-appointed guardian, Maria Schimer, who is also a registered nurse, has dropped her attempt to force Amish girl, Sarah Hershberger, 11, to have chemotherapy treatment

A court was wrong to appoint a guardian to make medical decisions for an Amish girl whose parents stopped her chemotherapy against doctors' wishes, the family's attorney said in court filings this week.

The lawyer for Sarah Hershberger's family, who have fled their Medina County home so the 11-year-old wouldn't be forced to have treatment, argued that the guardian be allowed to resign.

Ohio's guardianship statutes appear to let courts substitute their judgment for that of suitable parents while ignoring the parents' 'moral and constitutional interests,' Maurice Thompson wrote in his filing with the Ninth District Court of Appeals in Akron.

The court should take a narrower view that limits such second-guessing and is consistent with constitutional safeguards of their rights, he wrote.

To do that, the court must hold 'that the decisions of suitable parents may not be attacked by anyone anytime in an Ohio Probate Court, and that these careful and gut-wrenching life and death decisions cannot be second-guessed and overruled where the parents are suitable, and simply seek to try a less invasive treatment first,' wrote Thompson, who leads the libertarian 1851 Center for Constitutional Law in Ohio.

Clair Dickinson, an attorney for guardian Maria Schimer, said Thursday that he will submit a response to Thompson's filing later, but he declined to reveal what it might say.

Hershberger and her parents fled their home more than two months ago so she wouldn't be forced to resume chemotherapy for her leukemia. Instead, they decided to use natural medicines, such as herbs and vitamins.

The Hershbergers shun many facets of modern life and are deeply religious. 
They have said they stopped chemotherapy not for religious reasons but 
because it was making Sarah too sick and they feared it could end up 
killing her.

Doctors at 
Akron Children's Hospital believe Sarah's leukemia is treatable but have
 said she will die within a year without chemotherapy.

Schimer,
 an attorney who's also a registered nurse, has asked the court to let 
her drop her attempt to force Sarah to resume chemotherapy, because it 
became impossible to make medical decisions for Sarah after the family 
fled.

If approved by a 
judge, Schimer's resignation could end the family's months-long fight 
against the hospital and pave the way for them to return home, where 
they live on a farm and operate a produce stand near the village of 
Spencer, about 35 miles southwest of Cleveland.

Medina
 County Probate Judge Kevin Dunn has delayed a decision on the 
resignation request. He said he first wants to make sure he has 
authority to grant it in light of the ongoing appeal in state court.

In
 a separate filing on that issue this week, the family's lawyer argued 
that Dunn should immediately accept the resignation and that it wouldn't
 hinder the appeal.

Dickinson
 has said that an attorney told him the hospital won't continue its 
legal push to get chemotherapy for Sarah if her guardian's resignation 
is approved.

Schimer dropped her attempt to force the child to resume chemotherapy earlier in December.

The
 guardian was given the power to make medical decisions for Sarah after 
an appeals court ruling in October said the beliefs and convictions of 
the girl's parents can't outweigh the rights of the state to protect the
 child.

But Schimer decided
 to drop the effort because she doesn't know where Sarah is now and it 
has become impossible to monitor her health or make any medical 
decisions.

'It didn't make sense to drag this on any longer,' Dickinsonsaid.

Sarah's
 father said the family doesn't oppose modern medicine and that they 
didn't make their decision based on religious reasons.

They
 end chemotherapy, he said, because it was taking too great of a toll on
 their daughter and she feared the treatments would make her infertile.

Sarah
 and her parents left their home in rural northeast Ohio just days 
before the state appeals court allowed the guardian to take over medical
 decisions.

The family left the country in late September before returning to an undisclosed location outside Ohio.

Schimer's attempts to meet with the family were rebuffed, Dickinson said.

The guardian's decision to withdraw from the case still needs final approval from a county court.

'The
 judge's approval of this resignation will pave the way for the family's
 return home, which will allow Sarah to receive the family's preferred 
treatment under the best possible conditions,' Thompson said earlier.

Sarah's
 last known chemotherapy session was in June, but she has undergone 
alternative-therapy treatments and is doing well, her family has said.

Her grandfather, Issac Keim, told the Akron Beacon Journal that his granddaughter Sarah recently celebrated her 11th birthday and seems vibrant and healthy.

According to Mr Keim, blood and imaging tests indicated that Sarah's cancer is gone.

Thompson said the case came down to fundamental principles and constitutional rights.

'We made it clear to our opponents that they were in for a protracted battle,' he said.

Andy Hershberger, the Ohio girl's 
father, said this past summer that the family agreed to begin two years 
of treatments for Sarah last spring but stopped a second round of 
chemotherapy in June because it was making her extremely sick.

Sarah begged her parents to stop the chemo and they agreed after a great deal of prayer, Hershberger said. The family, members of an insular Amish community, shuns many facets of modern life and is deeply religious.

Hospital officials have said they are morally and legally obligated to make sure the girl receives proper care.

They said the girl's illness, lymphoblastic lymphoma, is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but there is a high survival rate with treatment.
