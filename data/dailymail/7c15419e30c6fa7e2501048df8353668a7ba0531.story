With supply low and demand high for Central London’s prime real estate, the only option for many wealthy homeowners hoping to expand in the capital is to go underground.

But this is troubling Joan Collins, who has spoken out about her disgust at rich residents building basements in exclusive Belgravia, where she has lived since buying a flat there in the late 1980s.

The 80-year-old actress - who was born in Paddington and looked at 60 different properties before buying her apartment - said there was ‘too much building work going on’ in her local area nowadays.

'It's shocking': Actress Joan Collins says there is 'too much building work going on' in Belgravia nowadays

She told Belgravia magazine: ‘It's really sad. I find it shocking that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys when they only live here for two or three months of the year.'

In the past the majority of homeowners have extended upwards over fears of causing permanent structural damage - but the trend for so-called 'iceberg homes' is growing.

Ten years ago, the number of planning applications for basement extensions in Kensington and Chelsea was just 64. In 2012 however, the number had soared to 307.

Collins told the community magazine that she enjoys living in the area, with her favourite shops including the Walden Chymist pharmacy, bookstore Belgravia Books and children's store Semmalina.

She added: 'I looked at about 60 flats in London. I wanted to be near to the West End and the theatres, and near to Chelsea. I love Belgravia, it's wonderfully quiet.'

The likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Nicole Kidman and Roman Abramovich have all extended underground. However, doing so comes at a premium.

Last August, millionaire hedge fund boss Reade Griffith was order to pay £800,000 to create a huge two-storey underground basement below his two adjoining Kensington townhouses.

He received the unprecedented levy from Kensington and Chelsea Council when he was granted planning permission for the extension, which houses a swimming pool, spa and 'treatment area'.

'Iceberg' extension: The underground development at the sprawling Grade II-listed property will include a swimming pool, gym, cigar room, wine store, plant room with rain water harvesting tank, cinema and lift

Collins - who is known for her role in 1980s TV soap opera Dynasty - has been married five times, and her parents were nightclub hostess Elsa Bessant and music agent Joseph Collins.

In September, it was revealed Tetra Pak heir Hans Rausing - who hid his crack addict wife Eva’s body in their Belgravia mansion as he struggled to face up to her death - was planning to go underground.

The underground development at the sprawling Grade II-listed property will include a swimming pool, gym, cigar room, wine store, plant room with rain water harvesting tank, cinema and lift.

Based on other recent projects in Kensington and Chelsea, it is estimated Mr Rausing’s basement - which is equivalent in size to nearly three average terraced houses - will cost £2million to build.

'Iceberg' extension: Tycoon John Caudwell plans to turn two mansions in Mayfair into a single dwelling

Mobile phone tycoon John Caudwell plans to turn two mansions in Mayfair into a single dwelling the size of Westminster Cathedral.

An ‘iceberg’ extension will be created by excavating beneath the existing properties to make space for a vast games room, swimming pool, sauna, kitchen, salon, media room, plant room and car park.

It will be 180ft long, stretching under each house and joining them beneath their gardens, which back on to each other in Mayfair.

The result will be a massive single property of some 50,000 sq ft – a normal town house is about 4,500 to 8,000 sq ft, while other  mansions in Mayfair are from 10,000 sq ft.

The ‘iceberg’ extension alone will cover 14,000 sq ft. Once complete, the mega-mansion will have 12 bedrooms - there are five in each house already and the plans include two more in the underground extension.

Addition: The Griffiths plan to build a subterranean extension underneath two Kensington townhouses

A hedge fund manager had to pay a fee of more than £800,000 to create a two-storey underground basement below his mansion.

Multi-millionaire Reade Griffith, 48, and his wife Elizabeth, 42, plan to build a vast subterranean extension underneath two adjoining Kensington townhouses at an estimated cost of £4million.

Housing a swimming pool, spa and ‘treatment ‘area’ it is likely to add £10million to the value of the property. At about 900 square metres, the basement would be the equivalent to eight average-sized new-build family homes.

But due to the sheer scale of the extension, Kensington and Chelsea Council asked for a one-off fee of £825,000 when it granted planning permission earlier this month.
