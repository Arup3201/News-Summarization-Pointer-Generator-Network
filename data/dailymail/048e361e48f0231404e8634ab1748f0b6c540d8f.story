Luis Suarez has left Liverpool and completed a £75million move to Barcelona.

Liverpool have finalised the terms of a club-record fee with Barcelona for the sale of striker Luis Suarez.

Official talks began over a week ago and were productive from the start with the Catalan side agreeing to meet the Uruguay forward's buy-out clause, believed to be £75m.

Subsequent
 negotiations continued over the method of payment as Liverpool were 
interested in taking forward Alexis Sanchez as a makeweight in the deal 
but with the Chile star having signed for Arsenal on Thursday 
it became a straight cash transaction.

The
 finer details of how exactly that is to be paid have now been hammered 
out and Suarez, currently serving a four-month ban for biting Italy's 
Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, is likely to be confirmed as a 
Barcelona player next week.

Suarez said it had always been a dream and ambition of his to play in Spain and he asked fans to understand his decision.

'It is with a heavy heart that I leave Liverpool for a new life and new challenges in Spain. Both me and my family have fallen in love with this club and with the city.

'But most 
of all I have fallen in love with the incredible fans. You have always 
supported me and we, as a family, will never forget it, we will always 
be Liverpool supporters.

'I
 hope you can all understand why I have made this decision. This club 
did all they could to get me to stay, but playing and living in Spain, 
where my wife's family live, is a lifelong dream and ambition. I believe
 now the timing is right.

'I
 wish Brendan Rodgers and the team well for the future. The club is in 
great hands and I'm sure will be successful again next season.

'I
 am very proud I have played my part in helping to return Liverpool to 
the elite of the Premier League and in particular back into the 
Champions League.

'Thank you again for some great moments and memories. You'll Never Walk Alone.'

Suarez's former team-mate Jamie Carragher tweeted: 'Luis was the best Lfc player I played with bar Gerrard. Gutted he's gone but was inevitable he would go to Spain one day.'

Biter

Suarez has faced three separate bans for biting, the first was seven matches in 2010 for an attack on Omar Bakkal while at Ajax. He was banned for 10 matches for a bite on Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013 and is currently serving his suspension for biting Giorgio Chiellini.

Cheat

Suarez has dived numerous times since his arrival in the Premier League, and even sent himself up with a celebration against Everton. And, before he came to the Premier League, there was that handball against Ghana.

Racist

This is from the official FA report into Suarez's racist abuse of Patrice Evra.

'Mr Suarez used insulting words towards Mr Evra during the match contrary to FA Rule E3(1); the insulting words used by Mr Suárez included a reference to Mr Evra's colour within the meaning of Rule E3(2);'Mr Suarez shall be warned as to his future conduct, be suspended for eight matches covering all first-team competitive matches and fined the sum of £40,000'

Reds boss Brendan Rodgers paid 
tribute to his departing striker, saying: 'Luis is a very special talent
 and I thank him for the role he has played in the team in the past two 
years, during my time at Liverpool.

'I
 think he would be the first to accept he has improved as a player over 
that period, along with the team and has benefited from being here, as 
we have benefited from him.

'The club 
have done all they can over a sustained period of time to try to keep 
Luis at Liverpool. It is with great reluctance and following lengthy 
discussions we have eventually agreed to his wishes to move to Spain for
 new experiences and challenges. We wish him and his young family well; 
we will always consider them to be friends.

'We
 are focused on the future, as we strive to continue with the progress 
we have made and build on last season's excellent Barclays Premier 
League campaign.

'I
 am confident we will improve the team further and will be stronger for 
this coming season, when we will be competing on all fronts; 
domestically and in the greatest club competition in the world, the 
Champions League.

'If
 there is one thing the history of this great club teaches us, it is 
that Liverpool FC is bigger than any individual. I hope our supporters 
continue to dream and believe that we are moving forward and with 
continued improvement and progression, together we will bring the 
success we all crave and deserve.'

The Anfield club confirmed the switch on Friday lunchtime.

'Liverpool FC confirms that Luis 
Suarez will be leaving the club after a transfer agreement was reached 
with FC Barcelona. The player now has permission to complete the usual 
formalities, which will then conclude the transfer,' said a statement.

'We
 would like to thank Luis for his contribution and the role he played in
 helping bring Champions League football back to Anfield.

'Everyone at Liverpool Football Club wishes Luis and his family well for the future.'
