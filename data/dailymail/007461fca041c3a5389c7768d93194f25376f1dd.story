Stationery companies are using a quirky new ingredient in a bid to help save the rainforest.

Rather than chop down trees to make paper, some brands like The Eden Project, which makes notebooks at the Maximus Elephant Conservation Trust in Sri Lanka, are using animal poo instead.

The process of making elephant dung paper is a little different to crafting regular handmade paper as the elephant's digestive system breaks down vegetable fibres so the dung is full of ready-to-use paper pulp.

The elephant dung is collected and vigorously boiled with margosa leaves, which have natural disinfectant properties.

This is  then mixed with  recycled paper.

The coarseness and shade of the paper is entirely dependent on the elephants’ diet, making each sheet as unique as the elephant that produced it.

One company is taking it even further by utilising a variety of animals' excrement.  

PooPooPaper uses dung from a host of different fibre-eating herbivorous animals such as elephants, cows, horses, moose, pandas and donkeys in northern Thailand.

These animals have highly fibrous diets of bamboo, sugar cane, grasses, banana trees, leaves, twigs and fruits.

Animals like donkeys, elephants and cows have highly fibrous diets of bamboo, sugar cane, grasses, banana trees, leaves, twigs and fruits so their dung is an ideal paper material, say the makers of this quirky stationery

Due to their specific digestive systems, they can't fully break down these fibres, making the dung perfect for paper making.

After collection, the dung is boiled for up to six hours, which softens the faeces and removes bacteria.

This  is then mixed with other non-wood fibres such as pineapple husks, hay and banana tree trunks.

The final product can be coloured using  non-toxic food colouring and laid out to dry in the sun before being crafted into a variety of different consumer and industrial products. 

As gifts and souvenirs, products include journals, notepads, albums, frames, bags, stationery, greeting cards, calendars, diaries, key chains, magnets and jewellery.

The company says its products are fun, eco-friendly, inspirational and a creative and novel alternative to wood-pulp based paper products, which rely on the continual cutting of trees and harvesting of forests.
