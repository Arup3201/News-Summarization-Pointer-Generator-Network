As two of Europe's most powerful women, they must have a few things in common. Yet when the Queen met German leader Angela Merkel yesterday they seemed keen not to get too close

Standing well outside of the monarch's personal space, Mrs Merkel reached gingerly over to shake the her hand as she went for tea at Buckingham Palace.

And Her Majesty and Mrs Merkel subsequently remained at a safe distance as they posed, smiling warmly, for the cameras.

The awkwardness was heaped atop earlier awkwardness when Mrs Merkel met her British counterpart David Cameron first thing this morning at Downing Street as she began her one-day visit.

After the Prime Minister and the German Chancellor – the most powerful leader in Europe – posed grinning for the cameras outside the front door of No 10, David Cameron planted a firm kiss on Angela Merkel’s cheek.

It was the beginning of a series of awkward poses, with Mr Cameron’s attempt at a handshake to seal the bond of friendship seeming not to go down too well.

A grimace from the Chancellor: Not quite the reaction Mr Cameron might have hoped for

As the Prime Minister placed one hand in hers and the other firmly on her arm, Mrs Merkel’s reaction was to pull a face, mouth turned down – possibly feeling that Mr Cameron was getting a bit too close, although it may have been a German attempt at a smile in response to a British attempt at humour.

Perhaps in a nod to her Tory host, Mrs Merkel had opted for a bright blue jacket, which she wore with smart black trousers and flat shoes.
