The man who secretly filmed the infamous ’47 percent’ video of Mitt Romney has finally come forward and explained why he decided to wade into the presidential dogfight.

Scott Prouty publicly admitted that he was the bartender who released the footage of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaking at a private fundraiser and he said that the motivating reason behind the move was so that all Americans could see the ‘true’ Romney.

‘Frankly the people that were there that night, they paid $50,000 per person for a dinner. I grew up in a blue collar area of Boston,’ Mr Prouty said in an interview with MSNBC’s Ed Schultz.

‘There's a lot of people who can’t afford to pay $50,000 for one night, for one dinner… I felt an obligation for all of the people who can't afford to be there.

The man behind the movie: Scott Prouty is the bartender who filmed the infamous video of Mitt Romney making off-the-cuff remarks about 47 percent of the American public being entitled

‘I knew where he came from, he was born with all of the advantages- he was the son of a Governor, a CFO, went to prep school and Harvard- and I don’t think he has any clue what a regular American goes through on a daily basis. The day in day out struggles of regular Americans that guy has no idea and I don’t think he will ever have any idea,’ he said.

Mr Prouty said that he brought a camera to the event because he was never told not to, and he told Schultz that he was not the only one as a number of other staff members wanted to possibly have their picture taken with Romney after the event.  

Mr Prouty said that he had the camera set up behind the bar so that he could film his speech while tending to his bar duties, but once he realized that Romney’s talk at that May fundraiser ‘wasn’t just any other speech’.

His attention was piqued when Romney walked into the room and quickly began ordering staff members around. Even though his comments that the workers should speed up their service was likely in jest, that still rubbed Mr Prouty the wrong way.

Leaked: James Carter, an opposition researcher, said he found the video online and put reporters from the left-leaning U.S. website Mother Jones in touch with an unnamed individual who had shot the footage

Woops! The resulting outcry over Romney's remarks is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the Republican lost the race to the White House

‘I can’t imagine demanding to be fed faster to be served faster,’ Mr Prouty said in an interview for The Ed Show.

After that, Romney began talking about the military-style organization of a factory in China where one of his companies had outsourced some of its work. The former governor went on to describe how 12 young women were living in each of the small boarding rooms, in three-tiered bunk beds.

‘At this point I realized this was not your typical speech,’ Mr Prouty said.

Mr Prouty thought that Romney’s views on the factory were the most outlandish, and reflective of what the candidate thought of practical work environments.

‘He just wandered through this horrendous place, and he thinks this is pretty good,’ Mr Prouty said.

Reasoning: Mr Prouty, seen left being interviewed by MSNBC's Ed Schultz, said that he wanted to remain anonymous until after the election so that the focus stayed on the video and not on him

‘He doesn’t care about the people who are out of work in the U.S. …. He’s a vulture capitalist who just doesn’t care on any level.’

From there, Romney went on to say the 
infamous remark that critically damaged his campaign: ‘There are 47 per 
cent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe 
that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility 
to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to 
food, to housing, to you name it. That that's an entitlement. And the 
government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president
no matter what.'

Egalitarian: Mr Prouty said that he wanted the comments to be seen by all of the electorate, and not just those who paid $50,000 to attend the dinner

Once it truly hit home that this was not the average stump speech, Mr Prouty realized that his recording was potentially damaging to Romney’s campaign and he needed to protect it.

At one point, he tossed a towel over the camera to make sure that no one spotted it. At another moment, he readjusted it’s position because a Secret Service agent was standing behind him.

‘I had no idea that it would be this big thing that it turned out to be,’ he said.

Once he cleaned up the bar and the night ended, the portion that struck a chord with Mr Prouty was the comments Romney made about the Chinese factory, where he recalled the site was fenced in with barbed wire on top- not to keep the workers in but to keep overzealous job applicants out.

Mr Prouty said that if he decided to release the video, he wanted to make sure that he had the proper facts behind him so that it stood up against critical tests, so he began reading up on Romney's visit to China and the questions raised about the Global Tech factory that he toured. That research lead him to David Corn, a journalist for liberal newsmagazine Mother Jones, as Mr Corn wrote an article about the factory.

Mr Prouty reached out to Mr Corn's assistant, James Carter, and the group began to discuss the tape and the decision to publish it online.

‘People could decide for themselves whether they agreed with him or not but I thought it was my duty to make sure as many people saw it as possible.

‘I thought it could be a game changer, I thought maybe it could take him out.’

Mr
Prouty said that he is a registered independent but tends to vote for 
Democratic candidates, and that the major reason why he debated for two 
weeks about whether or not he should release the footage came from the 
inevitable threat of backlash from conservative supporters.

‘I had offers - Today Show and this and that and the other as far away as Germany- and I thought it was absolutely the wrong thing to do. I thought that would change the topic of the conversation away from the subject to me,’ he said.
