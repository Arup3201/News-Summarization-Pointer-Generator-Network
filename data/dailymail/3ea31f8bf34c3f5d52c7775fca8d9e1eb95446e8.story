Blood oozed from the cut beneath his right eye. The wound was so deep that the bright red claret streamed down his protruding right cheek.

As Bastian Schweinsteiger lay sprawled on the touchline receiving treatment after a blow from Sergio Aguero, his leg twitched impatiently, eager to return to the battle as if a few wires had been short-circuited on impact.

Perhaps the most surprising thing when the blood had been wiped away was that raw pink flesh lay beneath the split skin, that it had not uncovered the glinting metal interior of a robot, programmed and primed for combat.

Like Terminator, when half of Arnold Schwarzenegger's face has been blown away and the menacing machine is exposed beneath.

Against
 Argentina – against all opponents at this World Cup – Schweinsteiger's 
six-foot frame stalked about the pitch mechanically, eyes squinted, 
trained on his next target; a goal to aim at, an opponent to tackle, a 
ball to intercept.

Yet
 once that final whistle blows in a match, Schweinsteiger is 
transformed. He was the first to console opponents in their defeat 
throughout the World Cup.

When
 the Germans crushed Portugal in their first game he embraced Cristiano 
Ronaldo. When they knocked out France and Brazil in the later stages he 
shared a hug with Karim Benzema and David Luiz. In the aftermath of the 
final, late into Sunday night, he lay an arm around the shoulders of an 
exhausted Lionel Messi.

His off-field persona is surely why he is such an influence, an inspiration, to his team-mates on it.

In
 2011 team-mate Mario Gomez scored a 25-minute hat-trick in a Champions 
League win against Napoli, but in testament to the effect Schweinsteiger
 has on the team his biggest concern post-match was that the central 
midfielder had gone off with a broken collar bone.

He may not quite be indestructible, but his absence noticeably shook the team.

Gomez
 said afterwards: 'Basti is our midfield motor. He dictates the tempo of
 the game and you could see that we lost our rhythm without him.'

Germany manager Joachim Löw calls him 'the brain,' while others have referred to him as the heart and the pulse.

But
 Schweinsteiger was anything but the life-blood of a team until his 
mid-20s. He was a drifter, looking for the right fit but failing to find
 it.

Louis
 Van Gaal is credited as developing the 29-year-old into a world class 
central midfielder during his two-year spell at Bayern Munich from 2009.

Up
 until then, Schweinsteiger was primarily a winger on the right or left,
 having played full-back as a youngster, and was used as a utility 
player.

But
 Van Gaal had Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery to play on either flank and
 spotted traits in him of a powerful force in the middle of the park; 
strong, not afraid to get stuck in, good in the air, an eye for a pass, 
with potential for the spectacular at any moment.

It is no wonder that reports have emerged that Van Gaal is keen on bringing him to Manchester United.

There
 are hints of Steven Gerrard about Schweinsteiger in that he has played 
his entire career at one club and is the nucleus in the centre of 
midfield, so whether or not he could be prised away from the Bundesliga 
club heading into his 30s is another matter.

Nice touch: But he finds the time to put a consoling arm around beaten finalist Lionel Messi

But there isn't much more he could win there. People hail Lionel Messi's Barcelona record but Schweinsteiger is not far off.

He
 has seven Bundesliga titles, seven German cups, two League Cups and a 
Champions League trophy. He has been runner up in the ultimate European 
club tournament twice.

One of those finals proved he is only human after all.

In
 the 2012 Champions League final against Chelsea, with the score tied at
 3-3 in the shootout, he missed the penalty which allowed Didier Drogba 
to step up to seal the victory.

There
 was shock in Germany afterwards when he appeared to refuse to shake the
 hand of their president Joachim Gauck in the post-match medal ceremony.

Schweinsteiger insisted it was not an intentional snub, saying: 'After this great disappointment, I noticed nothing around me.'

The player is wired to win – he struggles to compute what happens when he doesn't.
