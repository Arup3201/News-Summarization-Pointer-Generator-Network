A controversial Muslim free school is set to be placed in special measures after a damning official report condemned it as 'dysfunctional' and says that it is 'in chaos'.

Al-Madinah, a free school in Derby, has repeatedly been featured in the Press for allegedly forcing women teachers to cover their hair and making boys and girls sit separately in class.

Ofsted inspectors launched an urgent investigation into the school, and listed a number of serious criticisms in their official report, which was published this morning.

David Cameron said he would be prepared to shut down the school if it does not improve quickly.

A minister told MPs today that the school would not be allowed to 'languish in failure' and insisted the Government had taken 'swift action' to deal with the problem.

Damning: Al-Madinah free school in Derby has been heavily criticised in an official Ofsted inspection report

The report found that teachers were inexperienced, with many having never taught before, and were overly generous in assessing pupils' work.

It also wrote that boys and girls ate lunch in separate shifts, while older pupils were segregated by sex in the classroom.

'This school is dysfunctional,' the report stated. 'The basic systems and processes a school needs to operate well are not in place. The school is in chaos and reliant on the goodwill of an interim principal to prevent it totally collapsing.'

It continued: 'This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience.

'Leadership and management, including governance, are inadequate and have been unable to improve the school.'

Rules: A member of staff from the school, where female teachers were told to wear headscarves

Inspectors added: 'Staff have been 
appointed to key roles for which they do not have qualifications and 
experience. For example, most of the primary school teachers have not 
taught before and the head of the primary school is experienced in 
teaching secondary-aged pupils only.'

Sir
Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, called for Al-Madinah to be placed in special measures in the report, which 
rates the school as 'inadequate' in every category.

Al-Madinah
opened in September 2012 as one of the free schools which are the 
cornerstone of the Coalition Government's education policy, and has 412 pupils aged between four and 16.

It
boasts of having 'a strong Muslim ethos', with long school days and 
shorter holiday, which 'maximise opportunities for pupil achievement and 
success'.

The Ofsted inspection was brought forward 
following reports that religious hardliners had taken control of the 
school and imposed Islamic rules on all staff and pupils, including 
non-Muslims.

After the first day of the inspection, officials found so many worrying problems that they asked management to close down the school entirely while the investigation continued.

According to the report, pupils in the secondary school 'are generally given the same work regardless of their ability', meaning that the most able students are not sufficiently stretched.

Inspectors wrote that one hour-long maths lesson consisted almost entirely of pupils cutting out and pasting different shapes, while they said that the only subject which taught crucial literacy skills was Islamic Studies.

The school's problem's mean that 'attendance is low and declining', the report said, leading to problems with 'behaviour and safety'.

Acting headteacher Stuart Wilson accepted that the school has 'significant and serious problems' and that some lessons are not challenging pupils enough.

'Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody,' he told the BBC. 'We don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward.'

He said today: 'Any school that faces special measures, as we clearly now do, has got its fair share of problems. I accept we have a whole range of problems.

'Some of those are things we can fix in the short term quite quickly. Some of them are longer-term in terms of the longer-term progress for students, teaching and learning etc.'

Criticism: The report of the Ofsted inspection rated Al-Madinah as 'inadequate' on every criterion

When asked how parents have reacted 
to the news, Dr Wilson said: 'In many ways the parents are aware more of
the reality of the school than the Press are.

'They
didn't have the concerns about the segregation. You'll notice in the 
report that Ofsted said that there were no concerns about that.

'They
didn't have any concerns about the hijab. What they're seeing is the 
school is on a journey. I think we're in a position now where we're not 
where we want to be in terms of practicalities for the building.

'In
terms of having the right number of staff in place in key roles, that's
what we need to do now. We need key staff in key roles to allow the 
school to move forward as quickly as possible.'

Asked
whether he was concerned the school could face closure, he said: 'There
will need to be a school here for 412 children as of the end of last 
month.

'There are 
people on a daily basis who are doing a very difficult job very well. 
It's not something they signed up to when they came to the school to be a
member of staff here.

'We will do what's possible in the timescales that we're given. It's business as usual for our children.'

'Swift action': Schools minister David Laws told the House of Commons that the school's problems would be quickly tackled by the Government

The Prime Minister told the Derby Telegraph: 'I am not afraid to shut the school, of course.        

'We are taking rapid corrective action towards the school. We are taking a tougher approach and schools will be shut.'

He added: 'I am very disappointed all round by the Ofsted report and what is happening at the school, which is why we are acting swiftly.'

Answering an urgent question in the 
Commons today, schools minister David Laws said: 'After a steady start 
by the school, we became aware of potential breaches of the conditions 
in its funding agreement late this summer, and at the end of July we 
began a wide-ranging investigation in to the financial management and 
governance of the school.

'We
investigated whether the school was delivering on its requirement to be
inclusive and we investigated some allegations about the imposition of a
dress requirement on some members of staff.

'Our
investigations did indeed find significant and numerous breaches of the
conditions in its funding agreement and our concerns were such that we 
requested Ofsted to bring forward its planned inspection.'

Closed: The school was temporarily shut down during the urgent Ofsted investigation

He
added: 'The Ofsted report is published this morning. It has found the 
school is dysfunctional and is inadequate across every category of 
inspection

'We will not let any school, whether a free school, an academy school or a local authority school, languish in failure.

'The
Ofsted report confirms we are taking the right actions. We are not 
prepared to let a school fail its parents, its children and its 
community. We said we would take swift action in these cases and that is
exactly what we are doing.'

Shadow education secretary Tristram 
Hunt said Michael Gove's free schools agenda was 'out of control', 
adding that the policy had been dealt a 'devastating blow' by the 
revelations in Derby.

'The
Education Secretary has sacrificed learning for ideology,' he told MPs.
'It is not just Al-Madinah school which is dysfunctional, it is the 
Education Secretary's free schools policy.'

As
the report was published, the Department for Education released a 
letter sent to chairman of governors Shazia Parveen by schools minister 
Lord Nash, in which he says that Ofsted's report confirms the 'very 
serious concerns' he raised in a previous letter to the school.

'The report is further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address,' he writes.

'Contrary
to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more 
convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of
the Trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious 
failings at the school.'

Clash: Al-Madinah is one of the free schools championed by Education Secretary Michael Gove, left; his Labour opposite number Tristram Hunt, right, says that it shows the policy has failed

The local MP, Chris Williamson, has called for the school to be closed down completely following the litany of complaints.

'Frankly,
the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully 
expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative 
places in the council schools in the city,' he told the BBC.

Mr Hunt told the Guardian that the school's problems show that the Coalition's education reforms have failed.

'What
this report exposes is that David Cameron and Michael Gove's free 
school programme has become a dangerous free-for-all - an out of control
ideological experiment that has closed a school, leaving 400 children 
losing an entire week of learning,' he said.

'Pupils
have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to 
know how David Cameron and Michael Gove have allowed this to happen - 
especially as Ofsted identified that this school was not meeting the 
basic requirements on child protection before it was opened.

'Far
from an isolated incident, the failings at this school reveal the 
systemic threat to education standards under this Government. David 
Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a 
crisis entirely of their own making.'

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection.

'We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence.'

Derby City Council said it acknowledged the findings of the Ofsted report.

A statement said: 'Educational attainment for all children and young people in Derby is as always our priority. The council is keen to work with other agencies as partners to address the key issues outlined in the Ofsted report.'
