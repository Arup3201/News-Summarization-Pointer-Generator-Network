Thug Aaron Cawley pictured drinking on the night he assaulted Chris Kirkland

The thug who shoved Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland in the face during a championship football match has been revealed as a prolific hooligan who is banned from every football ground in the country.

Repeat offender Aaron Cawley, aged 20, whose actions have been condemned by football authorities, police and the public, has appeared in court at least three times for breaching the order.

Leeds United fan Cawley, from Cheltenham, was barred from all matches for five years when he was 16 after being caught at the centre of a 200-strong riot at the club's Elland Road ground.

His repeated breaches forced magistrates' to extend the order for a further two years until the end of 2013.

But on Friday night he managed to get
 inside the Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United match at Hillsborough, 
where Sky television cameras captured the shocking moment he ran on to the pitch
 and assaulted the former England goalkeeper.

During
 his latest court appearance last year, Cawley told Cheltenham Magistrates' Court: ‘My
 banning order was three months from being overturned.

‘If
 I was going to risk it I would have done it years ago. The risk was not
 worth it. I am not a hooligan. I don't go to cause trouble.’

His order 
prohibited him from travelling on the national rail network to or 
from any town or city if Leeds is playing a home or away match in that 
area.

Photographs of him on Facebook show him drinking and celebrating on the night of the shameful assault which took the goalkeeper by complete surprise.

A 21-year-old man has since been arrested for assault.

The assault came as Sheffield Wednesday scored an equaliser and was amid ugly scenes of taunting from both sides of the ground.

Kirkland required medical treatment before he could continue.

The FA is also investigating crowd trouble at the Yorkshire derby and is awaiting the referee's report.

Police said there were five arrests for various offences including public order before and after the game, while three people were ejected from the ground and 12 were subject to dispersal orders.

Gloucestershire Police said: 'A 21-year-old man from Cheltenham has been arrested on suspicion of assault after former England goalkeeper Chris Kirkland was shoved in the face during a Championship match between Leeds United and Sheffield Wednesday on Friday night.'

An FA spokesman said: ‘We have begun an immediate investigation and have been in contact with both clubs.

‘We would call for the authorities to 
identify and bring before the courts anyone who was involved in any form
 of criminal disorder.’

Leeds issued a statement after the game pledging to identify the man involved in the incident, who was widely named across social networking sites by the public.

It read: ‘Leeds United Football Club would like to publicly apologise and condemn the action of the fan who came on the pitch and attacked Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland.

‘The club will fully co-operate with the police and the football authorities in identifying the individual concerned.

‘After the week football has endured there is no place for this type of behaviour and the majority of Leeds supporters will be ashamed of his actions.’

The match was also marred by vicious chanting from some Leeds fans about Wednesday manager Dave Jones, who was cleared of child abuse allegations in 2000.

Wednesday fans replied with songs about two Leeds fans killed in Turkey in April 2000, sparking Leeds supporters to throw bottles on to the field and clash with police.

Jones called for Leeds fans to be banned from ‘every away ground’.
