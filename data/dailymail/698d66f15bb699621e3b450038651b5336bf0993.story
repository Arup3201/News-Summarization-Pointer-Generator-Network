When Sue Diamond bought this 
six-bedroom property on the cliffs after bidding just £154,500 at 
auction by telephone, she thought she had her dream home by the sea.

But she had not viewed it or had it 
surveyed before buying – and six days later tons of rock at the bottom 
of the garden collapsed on to the beach below, leaving the house 
precariously close to the edge.

Yesterday, three years on, her dream 
finally came to a crashing end when another huge chunk of cliff 
collapsed, taking much of the 1930s house with it.

A house that was bought for a knock-down price has fallen into the sea three years after Sue Diamond paid just £154,000 for it

The sea turned red after a huge landslide at around 9pm on Tuesdayb night that took most of the house down the cliff with it

The house has been sealed off for years after it was ruled to be 'structurally unsound' but that advice was ignored by Miss Diamond who was the highest bidder in a telephone auction. The neighbour's house in the background is believed to be safe from destruction

From a distance the vulnerability of the clifftop houses becomes even more clear with hundreds of tonnes of earth falling into the sea

So much sandstone fell 300ft into the bay at Torquay that the sea turned bright red.

Miss Diamond, 59, a retired police 
officer from London, had tried to sue the builder from whom she bought 
Ridgemont House in February 2010.

But the auction particulars had warned
buyers the house was severely structurally damaged and might be beyond 
economic repair, and a judge ordered her to pay what she owed.

The cliff fall in Devon is the latest around the British coast following strong winds, high tides and months of heavy rain.

In East Anglia, the fast receding coastline has been severely damaged.

At Hopton, Norfolk, sea defences have been breached, cliff paths destroyed and a number of properties left vulnerable.

The biggest cliff fall at the resort has seen a massive chunk of the coastline destroyed.

The huge house seemed too good to be true at such a cheap price with more than enough room and beautiful views across the sea

February 2013: The house fell down slowly as the shifting earth under its foundations warped it and pulled the walls and floors in all directions

But this was the scene just three years later when the land started falling from underneath it and into the sea below

Holidaymakers staying in caravans 
overlooking the sea reported hearing a crash like thunder as the cliff 
crumbled into the sea. Three caravans had to be moved after they were 
left within feet of the cliff edge.

Part of a footpath that led down to the beach was swept away.

Brian Hardisty, the chairman of Hopton
Coastal Action Group, said: ‘The coastline has deteriorated greatly in 
just the last two weeks.

‘The high winds combined with high tides mean that it is just disappearing.

‘The beach has lost so much sand, which means the sea defences have become weakened allowing the sea to hit the cliff.

‘The cliff has been slowly eroding, 
but this is the first time there has been a big fall right from the top 
to the bottom of the cliff.’

All that is now left is a couple of rooms in the house with the bulk of it strewn down the cliff along with the gardens of the house

Mike Page, a pilot photographer, has taken pictures of the coast along East Anglia charting the places where the coastal erosion is happening.

The images show caravans that are now just feet away from the cliff edge at Easton Bavents, near Southwold, Suffolk, and are increasingly at risk of toppling over on to the sands below.

Nearby Covehithe has also been blasted by wind-driven seas, with salt-killed trees left uprooted and strewn along the beach.

Further up at the coast at Hopton, near Lowestoft, the damage is even worse, with defences breached and cliff paths destroyed, leaving more and more properties vulnerable.

Gary Watson, Norfolk and Suffolk coastal engineer with the Environment Agency, said easterly winds were partly to blame for the erosion.

Mr Watson said: 'Over the last two weeks we have had persistent easterlies coming in, some of them quite strong. These tend to scour some beaches away. As a result we have recorded very low beach levels. That's what we would mainly see in the winter.'

Caravans have been removed from their pitches close to the edge of a cliff that has fallen away despite sea defences

These houses have also been abandoned due to their precarious position on the edge of the cliffs of Easton Bavents

He said that by now beaches should be 
rebuilding after the annual winter battering and giving crucial 
protection to the coastline.

But
the freak icy spell, months of sub-zero temperatures and killer North 
Sea winds had almost bludgeoned exposed beaches into submission.

'Once
we get out of these easterlies we should start seeing calmer conditions
and more constructive waves that will push sand back up the beach,' 
said Mr Watson.

He said responsibility for managing the stretch of coastline lay with Waveney District Council.

The authority is now working with the Environment Agency to monitor the deepening crisis.

But
Suffolk's Shoreline Management Plan (SMP), which sets out how the coast
will be protected, has outlined a policy of 'no active intervention' 
for the hamlets of Benacre and Covehithe.

As
a result, defences will not be provided or maintained and the sea and 
winds will continue to take huge chunks out of the rapidly-disappearing 
coastline.
