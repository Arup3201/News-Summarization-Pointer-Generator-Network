Samir Nasri wants to follow in Thierry Henry's footsteps by finishing his career in the MLS.

The Frenchman signed a new five-year deal last summer, which will take him through to his 32nd birthday.

And the Manchester City star, speaking to Sportsmail at the recent New Balance Football global launch in London, has outlined his plan to play in America, after insisting a return to France is not an option for him.

'I would like to play MLS, not go back to France,' he said.

'Maybe I would go back to Marseille but it would be too difficult - maybe impossible.

'I would like the MLS, like Thierry Henry. I love the lifestyle in USA and everything about it.'

The MLS' profile is set to increase in the following months with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard both due to arrive in the USA to continue their playing careers.
