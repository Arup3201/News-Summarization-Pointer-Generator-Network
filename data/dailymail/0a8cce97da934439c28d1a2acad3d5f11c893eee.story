Michael Green, 84, was dragged from his car and left with a broken hip and needing surgery to a head wound after he was carjacked by a gang of thug

A pensioner was dragged from his 'pride and joy' car and beaten up with a metal weight during a carjacking by a gang of as many as six teenagers outside his local pub.

Michael Green, 84, was yanked from his 15-year-old Â£2,000 car outside the Trumpet in Bilston, West Midlands, on Friday evening.

He was then beaten around the head with a metal weight by one of the group - who left him in the road with a broken hip and needing serious surgery to his head.

As the retired sales rep and musician started his engine the three yobs pulled open his door and grabbed him from the Toyota Avensis, police said.

They then sped off in the Â£2,000 vehicle leaving the frightened pensioner lying badly injured in the gutter at around 11.30pm.

He was spotted by a passer-by who raised the alarm.

The widower was taken to Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital where surgeons operated on the wound and his fractured hip. 

His daughter Gisella Smith released a shocking photo of her father's injuries and made an emotive plea for information. 

She said the 15-year-old car had been her father's 'pride and joy' and the callous attack has had a 'massive' effect on him. 

She added: 'My dad is the most amazing person, when I was two, my mother died and he single-handedly raised three children.

'Throughout my childhood he held down two jobs - by day he was a sales rep and by night he was a semi-professional drummer.

'Music is my dad's life. Going to the Trumpet is his life. He loves going there as they play live music. I'm just hoping that he has got the confidence to go back.

'Over the last few years he has been a bit slower on his feet and now walks with a stick.

'He felt at home at the Trumpet he always parked his car, which was his pride and joy, in the same spot.

She added: 'He is the kindest, politest man I know, a real proper old fashioned gentleman and I am proud to call him my dad.

'He had literally just got in the car he hadn't even put his belt on when he was dragged from it. He then suffered a sustained attacked and was repeatedly punched and kicked.

'Luckily a passer-by spotted him and it was them that called the police. People from the pub then came out to help. They have been really upset about it all.

'I have no words really to describe how we feel about the attackers. There was no motive. It's not a fancy car but it was my dad's pride and joy.

'They smashed the windows in front of him before driving off.  I'm just so glad he is alive when you hear the full details -you wouldn't wish it on anyone's dad and grandad.'

As a young man as a young musician Mr Green was in the Mike Green Galaxy band -  a regular resident band at the Civic in Wolverhampton - and his music has been played in the Royal Albert Hall.

West Midlands Police said the thieves crashed Mr Green's car a short time later  - less than four miles away from the pub.

A 16-year-old was arrested on suspicion of robbery and was later bailed pending further enquiries.

But Det Chief Insp Pete Dunn, the senior investigating officer in the case, said the father-of-two was attacked by youths who may be as young as 15-years-old.

He said: 'It is possible there were six teenagers involved.

'This is a significant attack which has resulted in one arrest of a young male so far.

'The lines of inquiry include looking at the vehicle, the CCTV from the pub and CCTV of where the vehicle was left.

'We are looking for six young males aged between 15- 18 and the victim is the only witness at the moment.

'The car was abandoned just one and a half miles from the public house.

Mr Green's daughter said: 'I have no words really to describe how we feel about the attackers. There was no motive. It's not a fancy car but it was my dad's pride and joy'' His car was a Toyota Avensis, similar to the one pictured

'The attackers used a bag containing a heavy object to hit the victim across the head and dragged him across the floor.

'He was punched and kicked as well before they drove off.'

He added: 'We have taken the unusual step to ask the family to help with our appeal.

'This was a motiveless and cowardly attack on a vulnerable and elderly man.

'This pub is a lifeline for Michael and to be attacked in this way is totally unacceptable.

'I will do everything within my power to bring these culprits to justice and I am appealing for the communities help.

'If anyone has any information no matter how insignificant I would urge them to call me or one of my team on 101.'
