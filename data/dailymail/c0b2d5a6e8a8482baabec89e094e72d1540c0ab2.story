England manager Roy Hodgson named his squad for the start of the Euro 2016 qualifiers  but has yet to explain to his employers why the World Cup campaign went so horribly wrong.

But pressure from members of the FA board -concerned that such a dire performance would not receive the forensic post mortem it merited -has at least led to Hodgson meeting the FA directors to discuss France 2016 over two-and-a-half months on.

Looking forward: Roy Hodgson has named his squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier with Switzerland 

Summer of disappointment: England crashed out of the World Cup at the group stages

Hodgson is scheduled to talk to the board ahead of their September meeting when they will expect a full breakdown as to what can be put right ahead of Euro 2016. Subjects will include whether the 88-strong FA party was too big in Brazil and whether preparation was correct.

Surprisingly -especially following a World Cup exit after just two games -there will be no official report but instead continuous assessment throughout the FA on what to put right.

England will have either home or away fixtures against four European giants - Germany, Spain, France and Italy - over the next two years to help drum up backing for a national team to be watched by its lowest crowd at the new Wembley against Norway next Wednesday.

FA general secretary Alex Horne called the expected crowd of between 35,000 and 40,000 ‘disappointing’ and added ‘there is some work to do’ re-engaging with disillusioned regulars.

One ambitious plan is to build a new fanbase by enrolling 500,000 football fans in the revamped England Supporters Club, despite current members being upset at the way they’re taken for granted.

Not many sporting bodies have the resources to invite representatives from 54 territories to Europe’s most expensive playground Monaco for basically a vanity project announcement.

But UEFA president Michel Platini put up all of Europe’s football powerbrokers in the Meridien Beach Plaza Hotel just to tell them during a brief 55-minute summit that he wouldn’t be standing against Sepp Blatter in the FIFA elections next May as widely predicted.

UEFA didn’t even put forward another candidate in the knowledge that Blatter, who has the support of the five other confederations, is certain to win a ludicrous fifth term. 

An expected attack on Blatter didn’t materialise, either, although Platini did tell his UEFA representatives on the FIFA ExCo not to be ‘sheep and say yes to the omnipresent Blatter all the time.’

The FA board have effectively acknowledged that referee grandee David Elleray receiving only a slap on the wrist for his ghastly racist comment — ‘You look rather tanned, have you been down a coal mine?’ — to an FA colleague sent out all the wrong signals for an organisation supposedly cracking down on all forms of discrimination. 

Wrong signals: The FA have effectively acknowledged their lenient treatment of David Elleray sent the wrong message 

The protests -led by Sports Agenda -over Elleray’s ultra-lenient treatment have led to FA directors agreeing there should be an independent element to future investigations over code of conduct breaches, rather than the inquiry being conducted entirely in-house.

Wembley Euro banker

The FA must believe UEFA awarding Wembley the final and semi-finals of Euro 2020 in Geneva on September 19 is a formality. The official FA party includes ineffective Minister for Sport Helen Grant and only a representative for London Mayor Boris Johnson. Grant wouldn’t even comment on England’s World Cup debacle, despite travelling on official business to Brazil.

Meanwhile, the deep scars from the 2018 World Cup election fiasco — when the FA had PM David Cameron, David Beckham and Prince William in Zurich to secure just one vote from outside the UK — look to have healed. 

England are considering bidding for Euro 28 and believe hosting the Euro 2020 climax will not impact on that ambition. The Scottish FA are also hopeful the feelgood factor from Glasgow’s Commonwealth Games will help Hampden Park’s Euro 2020 cause, with Wales and Ireland expectant for the group stages as well.
