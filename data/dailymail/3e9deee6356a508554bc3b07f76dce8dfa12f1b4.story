Bloody, brutal and over-the-top. These would be the words to describe Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge. And while his outing on the Wii U is an improvement over other console versions, fundamental issues in the gameplay blunt Ninja Gaiden’s blade yet again.

Plot wise, and it’s standard fare for the series. Ryu gets a visit from the hilariously named Japan’s Self Defense Force, calling on him to help stop the Lords of Alchemy carrying out terrorist attacks around the world.

Just doesn't cut it: Parts of Razor's Edge are OK, but it's mostly very repetitive

It’s not long before a head-to head with one of them, the Regent of the Mask, results in Ryu acquiring the Grip of Murder – an ugly growth on his arm that feeds on the deaths of others.

This is where the gameplay comes in, which primarily revolves around chopping off as many enemy limbs as possible. Although new upgradable weapons and abilities offer some much-needed variation to proceedings, combat gets very boring, very quickly.

It’s made all the more worse by the awful soundtrack, which pops up every time enemies comically jump over fences (or other ‘no-go’ areas) and run towards you – often blurting out pointless expletives in an attempt to sound threatening.

Levels are so incredibly lazily laid out, that you can easily predict when the next gruelling battle will take place. Graphics remain mostly bland, with almost non-existent textures, but Ryu himself is quite well animated - especially in the cut-scenes.

AI, too, is a mixed bag. Indeed, one of the game’s strengths is its difficulty curve, and enemies will soon get wise to the same one-button combo. They'll also keep coming at you, even if they're missing limbs, so it's important to quickly finish them off with one of Ryu's gruesome executions.

Bloody: The comically-named Grip of Murder glows red when Ryu starts killing things

This is where Razor's Edge is at its best - where it forces you to use the game’s complex combinations. Thankfully, weapons can be upgraded and moves unlocked, with the GamePad acting primarily as an inventory. This generally works well.

The campaign, too, boasts two more missions, and you can also play as Ayame from the Dead or Alive series.

Hardcore Gaiden fans may get something from this but for most, Razor's Edge just will not cut it.
