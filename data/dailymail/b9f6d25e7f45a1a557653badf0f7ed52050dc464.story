Manchester City must overcome the perils of sub-zero temperatures, echoing stands, a dodgy pitch and in-form opponents if they are to kick-start their Champions League campaign in Moscow on Tuesday.

Manuel Pellegrini's team have taken just one point from their two Group E fixtures so far, losing to Bayern Munich in Germany and then being held by Roma at the Etihad Stadium.

They desperately need a repeat of last season's win over CSKA in Moscow to boost their chances of advancing from a difficult group, but conditions will be tricky.

Indeed, the potential for a damaging defeat was considered so high that City took the unusual step of flying in two days before the match in order to properly acclimatise.  

The first heavy snowfall seen in the Russian capital this winter arrived on Sunday night, leaving the ground blanketed in the white stuff - to the excitement of Edin Dzeko, who posted a picture on social media.

The forecast leading up to kick-off is for more snow and also sleet, while temperatures for the match are set to be below freezing.

It will certainly come as a shock to the City players, who have been used to the relatively warm weather of an Indian summer in England.

Then there will be the unusual silent atmosphere of the Arena Khimki to contend with. UEFA have banned the sale of tickets and ordered the match to be played behind closed doors as punishment for the racist behaviour of CSKA fans.

It’s cold and it’s wet here in Moscow. One of the first heavy snowfalls of the winter took place overnight and there's a few inches lying on the ground outside my hotel at the moment. The forecast over the next 36 hours here is a mixture of snow and sleet while the temperature for the game will be somewhere below freezing. Nice.

The CSKA support have a pretty long charge sheet. They were handed a three-match stadium ban for the racist behaviour of their fans, with an appeal set to be heard by UEFA on October 27.

They were sanctioned following violence during their 5-1 defeat by Roma on matchday one, when CSKA fans lit flares and threw them at home supporters, with racist banners also unfurled.

This was their third charge of racism in less than a year. During City's visit last season, Yaya Toure was subjected to racial abuse at the Khimki Arena.

This led to a partial stadium closure but when they displayed 'a range of racist and far-right symbols' in the match with Viktoria Plzen last December, UEFA handed down a full stadium closure for their matchday two encounter with Bayern Munich this season.

Bayern boss Pep Guardiola admitted he felt uncomfortable with the eerily quiet atmosphere, saying: 'Football is about the supporters. I hope we don't have to play behind closed doors again.'

Bayern chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge agreed: 'It was a strange game. There was no atmosphere or emotions.'

Pellegrini has already said there will be no advantage for City in playing the must-win match in an empty ground.

He said: 'I don't think we must try to win with outside benefit of our team. We must try to win because we are better than CSKA playing away or at home.

'If not, if we need those kind of things to win the game, then I don't think we are a big team. It's always good to play with a crowd that can go to the stadium.'

There have also been concerns about the pitch at the Khimki Arena. Last season, Pellegrini described as 'unbelievable' the decision to play the CSKA-City match on a surface that had been condemned as unplayable.

The pitch collapsed under heavy rainfall and City struggled on the uneven surface, although they ultimately won 2-1 thanks to a double from Sergio Aguero.

It led to CSKA's final group match, against Plzen, being moved to St Petersburg while repairs were made.

Both teams enter the game lying second in their respective leagues. In-form CSKA have won their last six league matches and put six past Kuban Krasnodar on Saturday. 

Their form has CSKA brimming with confidence, with striker Ahmed Musa claiming City are 'weak' opponents.

CSKA striker Ahmed Musa believes City are 'weak' opponents and that his team could win

He said: 'As you can see, they are very weak this year. We are going to use that advantage against them.

'In a couple of games they haven't been that good. They are very weak in the defence, so we are going to do our best to work against that.

'I think we are going to have a great opportunity because of the quality of the players we have. I think Tuesday is going to be a very good game for us.

'We are going to do our best to win because this is the last opportunity that we have.'
