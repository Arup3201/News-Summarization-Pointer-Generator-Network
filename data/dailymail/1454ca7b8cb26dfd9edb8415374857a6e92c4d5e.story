Welcoming your first child should be one of the most joyous occasions anyone can experience. 

But Viscountess Weymouth has revealed for the first time details about the 'terrifying' illness that forced her to have her baby son three weeks earlier than planned.

The aristocrat, formerly known as Emma McQuiston, is married to Ceawlin Thynn, Viscount Weymouth, the heir to the Longleat estate, and gave birth to The Hon. John Thynn in October.

Viscountess and Viscount Weymouth welcomed their first child, John, in October but Lady Emma has told Hello! how a crippling illness forced her to give birth three weeks early

Posing in a stunning full-length blue gown while holding a beautiful baby John outside the stately home, Lady Weymouth told Hello! she had been diagnosed with a bleed on the brain.

She was also suffering from a disorder with her pituitary gland which left her crippled in pain and meant the baby was delivered by Caesarean section three weeks early.

Lady Weymouth, who is the UK's first black aristocrat, said: 'It was terrifying. I'd never been ill before and I was 36 weeks pregnant.'

The high-society star, who is still undergoing tests as doctors try to find out what happened, said giving birth had changed her life forever.

The Viscount is the heir to the Longleat estate, which is visited by thousands each year

She said: 'I'm different to how I used to be but then I think having a baby changes everyone. I'm worrying a lot and thinking about the stuff that's not even happening, the what ifs.

'And I can't run around like I used to - I overestimate my energy and then crash and I'm emotional, so emotional. But I just have to get over it and get a grip.'

Lady Weymouth said the birth was 'incredible' - and the arrival of baby John had made her marriage stronger than ever.

'Ceawlin held him first and then put him on my chest,' she said. 'I was just like, "Wow". You forget everything, nothing else matters once you have a baby.

'It's made our relationship stronger because we've had something serious to cope with and we both love the baby so much, this person we've made. It's extraordinary how nature works. Mind-blowing.'

John, she says, has brought new life to Longleat. 'It feels like a renaissance,' she said.

'It's always been vibrant here - there's always been something exciting going on - but it's a new generation, a new dynamic. It's a very exciting time.'

This happy news for the Viscount and Viscountess comes after years of unease for their family. 

The couple married in June 2013 but the wedding was marred by the fact that the Viscount's parents - the Lord and Lady Bath - did not attend. 

At the time they were not on speaking terms with the couple. 

It is thought that the family fall out had come about due to the removal of some ancient murals which had adorned the walls of the famous Longleat estate in Wiltshire.

Lady Weymouth said at the time: 'It’s very sad he didn’t come to the wedding and that the misunderstanding has escalated to this point, but what can I do?’

However the family are now on good terms and will no doubt be looking forward to spending their first Christmas with little John.
