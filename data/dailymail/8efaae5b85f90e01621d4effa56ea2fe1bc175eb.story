Nottingham Forest descended into chaos  as manager Stuart Pearce and owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi argued about the £7million sale of Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow to Newcastle United.

A furious Pearce claimed that the deal involving two of Forest’s best players was agreed behind his back, but Al-Hasawi responded by insisting that the new boss was consulted and that the transfers were necessary for the club to meet financial fair play rules.

In a twist likely to cause further disharmony between the pair, last night Reading moved in for forwards Simon Cox and Jamie Mackie. Forest, in turn, have approached Sheffield Wednesday for their 24-year-old winger Michail Antonio.

Dispute: Fawaz Al Hasawi has hit back at Stuart Pearce's claims he was left in the dark at Nottingham Forest

Stars: But Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow were sold on the cheap to Premier League side Newcastle United

Pearce said he would not walk away from the City Ground, where he was a legend during 12 years as a player.

Centre back Lascelles, 20, and goalkeeper Darlow, 23, will be loaned back to Forest this season with their wages being picked up by Newcastle — and while Pearce is grateful for that, he believes their value in the market would have been substantially higher next season.

Lascelles, who was the subject of a £5m bid from Arsenal in 2011, signed a four-and-a-half-year contract in March, while highly-rated Darlow had three years left on his deal.

Pearce takes charge of his first competitive match since returning to Forest when Blackpool visit Nottingham on Saturday but before then will seek talks with Al-Hawasi, who was forced to deny accusations that he would meddle in team affairs when Pearce was unveiled back in April.

The pair were at loggerheads yesterday as each made public his own version of events. Pearce said: ‘I am not prepared to fluff things when it comes to what was said and done behind the scenes. Two players were sold against my will. It disappointed me.

‘If it was my money, the boys would not have been sold. When it is out of my hands, there is not a lot I can do about it. All I can do is make a recommendation to people. I thought I could push their value up and that they would be worth more in the long run.

‘The first I heard about things was when Jamaal told me that he had a medical at Newcastle.

New boss: Stuart Pearce said he was extremely disappointed with the decision

‘I would like to think that, somewhere down the line, they would back my knowledge, with respect of the amount of time I have been in the game.

‘The chairman Fawaz has been in Kuwait the whole of this summer so I’ve not had a conversation with him regarding the players. But I did with other financial people at the club.

‘They asked my opinion about what I thought of the offer and I said don’t do the deal — but the deal was done.

‘I don’t know the financial constraints the club are working under. I plan to find that out, very soon. Then perhaps I can understand this decision.’

Making his mark: Al Hasawi purchased the Championship club back in 2012

In a statement released on the club website, Al-Hawasi countered: ‘The manager and I openly discussed the proposed sale of Karl and Jamaal and he was aware of the negotiations throughout. The business side of football is changing and the requirement to increase revenue means, unfortunately, difficult decisions have to be made.

‘Should the pair’s proposed move to Newcastle be completed as expected, the transfer fees will significantly help us meet the stringent Financial Fair Play criteria, all the while allowing us to retain two high-quality players for the 2014-15 season, paying nothing towards their wages.

‘Sadly for me, there is no room for sentimentality in the running of a football club and it is up to me to start making some tough decisions to preserve the long-term sustainability of Nottingham Forest.

‘But while balancing the books is a hugely significant part of my role, it remains my job to ensure the manager has the best possible squad to work with as we pursue a place in the Premier League.He added on Twitter shortly afterwards: ‘Stuart and I work together as a team, and not work behind each other’s backs to bring the best out of this club.’
