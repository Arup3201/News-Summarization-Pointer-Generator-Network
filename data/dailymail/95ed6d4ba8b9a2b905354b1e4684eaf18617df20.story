Millions of families will be no better off in 2015 than they were in 2000 due to a devastating attack on household finances, according to Britain’s leading think tank.

The average worker will have suffered the worst squeeze on incomes in memory by the time of the next General Election, warns the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

Its bleak assessment comes less than a week before the Budget and piles pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to take radical action to jump-start the economy.

Strain: There has been no real growth in income since 2000, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies, putting pressure on ordinary hard-working families

There are record numbers in work in Britain, with nearly 30million in employment even despite the mounting risk of a triple-dip recession.

But workers’ real pay – what they earn after inflation – is plummeting as families around the country are hammered by paltry pay rises, soaring household bills and inflation, tax hikes and benefit cuts.

Speaking to the Daily Mail, IFS director Paul Johnson said the 15-year assault on living standards was unheard of. ‘It is unprecedented that people are getting worse off year on year,’ he said.

‘And we reckon that by 2015 the average person will be no better off than they were at the turn of the century. Fifteen years without real income growth is unprecedented, at least in living memory.’

Average incomes continued to rise, albeit slowly, even after the start of the credit crunch in 2008.

But real pay fell by 3.7 per cent in the 2010-11 tax year – the biggest drop since 1981, according to the IFS. Spending power fell again last year and is set to fall this year and next with living standards only expected to start rising again in 2014-15.

It means that once the higher cost of living has been taken into account, the average worker in Britain will have no more to spend in 2015 than they did at the turn of the century – signalling a decade-and-a-half of pain for millions of households.

Mr Johnson said not all of the squeeze was down to the Government as it tries to balance the books.

‘The really key thing about what has been happening over three years is that real earnings have been falling,’ said Mr Johnson. ‘This squeezed middle is squeezed because their earnings are falling – not because of higher taxes or lower benefits.’

Inflation has been above the 2 per cent target since late 2009 and the Bank of England does not expect it to return to that level until 2016.

There is also pressure from the increase in VAT to 20 per cent, the loss or cut in child benefit for more than one million families and changes to tax credits.

Of those changes, Mr Johnson said: ‘Families with children have been hit significantly harder than families without children.’
