As the saying goes, where there's muck, there's brass.

And one crook seems to have taken that rather literally, launching a crime spree which left public toilets  across Denver, Colorado, stripped of valuable parts worth more than $6,000.

But now the thief, dubbed the 'Crapper Scrapper', has been caught, according to police.

Caught short: Plumber Allen Citron is accused of being the 'Crapper Scrapper'

Plumber Allen Citron, 48, is accused of stealing pipes and valves from lavatories - even targeting a hospital's restrooms - then cashing in the parts at local scrap metal dealers.

Police say Citron only needed a few minutes, a wrench and a screw driver to steal pipes and the plumbing in toilets.

Jamie Greaser with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department said: ‘What he takes and gets very little money for at these scrap yards is costing these business thousands of dollars to replace.

‘He would carry a bag with him and would go in to public toilets, sometimes lock himself in, sometimes not, and he would very quickly remove all of the equipment from the toilets.’

He faces 18 charges, including burglary 
and theft from several locations, including Southwest Plaza Mall, 
University of Denver, and Craig Hospital.

Spree: Thefts from public toilets were reported at 18 locations across Denver, but police suspect the 'Crapper Scrapper' hit even more places

The alleged ‘crapper scrapper’ was spotted by one business’ vigilant employee realized what Citron was allegedly doing.

Ms Greaser said: ‘He watched the suspect walk in to the bathroom and leave with the parts from the toilet.

'And he walked outside and got a license plate number and it just went from there.’

Investigators say there are 18 known cases of the toilet theft, which include the Southwest Plaza Mall in the family restroom area, a Littleton Chick-fil-A, a Denver Taco Bell, King Soopers, and the Bowles Crossing cinema.

But based on the number of trips to scrap yards, detectives suspect Citron has hit other businesses as well.

Ms Greaser said: ‘We believe we’ve only hit the tip of what he’s done and we believe that there are several more that are not reported.’
