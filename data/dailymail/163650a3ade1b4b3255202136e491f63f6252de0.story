Ed Miliband hopes of seizing power next year were rocked last night by a poll suggesting Labour faces a wipeout in Scotland.

Ipsos Mori found that 52 per cent of Scots would vote for the SNP if there was a Westminster election tomorrow, compared with just 23 per cent for Labour.

If the findings are repeated next May, Labour will lose 37 of its 41 seats in its Scottish heartland, dealing a major blow to Mr Miliband’s hopes of becoming prime minister.

Nicola Sturgeon is the new SNP leader vowing to take on Ed Miliband, whose hopes of becoming Prime Minister could rest on securing dozens of seats in Scotland

The results would deliver the SNP an incredible 54 seats, potentially leaving them as kingmakers at Westminster.

The poll also makes gloomy reading for Tories and Lib Dems, putting them on 10 and 6 per cent respectively. High-profile victims of such a swing to the SNP would include Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander and the Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander.

The shock poll for STV News follows a calamitous period for Labour in Scotland, which has seen it lose power in the Scottish Parliament and struggle to connect with many traditional supporters in the recent referendum campaign.

Mr Miliband, who was in Glasgow last night at a gala dinner for Labour supporters, denied the party was in disarray north of the border.

The Labour leader acknowledged it had been a tough week following the resignation of Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, who quit with a parting blast at the Westminster leadership. But he insisted Labour could still win the General Election.

‘I look forward to working shoulder to shoulder with whoever the party in Scotland elects as leader to win that election,’ he said. ‘We face a tough fight but no tougher than the fights we have faced in the past.’

One Labour source even suggested the poll could help the party by reinforcing the message that voting for the SNP will help David Cameron to retain power. But the senior Scottish Labour MP Thomas Docherty said the party was in a ‘dreadful position’ in Scotland. Mr Docherty, shadow deputy leader of the Commons, said: ‘The state that the Labour party is in right now is we are in a dreadful position.

‘We’ve got to be honest about ourselves. The electorate looks at us and has no idea what our policies are. We have a moribund party in Scotland that seems to think that in-fighting is more important than campaigning. And we have a membership that is ageing and inactive.

‘We can return to be the grown-up party that wants to be in government or we can self-indulge like a throwback to the 1980s and watch our party implode, the SNP win again, the Tories win again, and have another referendum.’

Former Labour Cabinet minister Jim Murphy has confirmed he will stand for the leadership in Scotland, but the prominent Blairite may struggle to pick up union support and is expected to face a stiff challenge from Left-wingers.

Labour is braced for possible defeat in another heartland today, with Ukip quietly confident of winning the by-election for a police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire. It was sparked when Labour’s Shaun Wright quit following controversy over his handling of the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal. 

Labour MP Thomas Docherty warned his party was in a 'dreadful position'

A Labour frontbencher today issued a damning assessment of the party's fortunes. 

Thomas Docherty, shadow Deputy Leader of the House, warned his party is in a 'dreadful position'.

The Dunfermline and West Fife claimed Labour is now 'moribund' in Scotland and risks being plunged into infighting.

He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ‘The state that the Labour party is in right now is we are in a dreadful position.'

He said Labour has 'got to be honest about ourselves', adding: 'We have very low esteem with the electorate. The electorate looks at us and has no idea what our polices are. 

'We have a moribund party in Scotland that seems to think that infighting is more important than campaigning. 

'And we have a membership that is ageing and inactive. We can return to be the grown-up party that wants to be in government or we can self-indulge like a throwback to the 1980s and watch our party implode, the SNP win again, the Tories win again, and have another referendum.'

At the 2010 general election Labour won 42 per cent of the Scottish vote, compared with the SNP's share of 19.9 per cent.

The poll was carried out amid a turbulent period for Scottish Labour, which culminated in the resignation of leader Johann Lamont on Friday.

She stepped down with an attack on UK Labour colleagues whom she accused of treating Scotland as a 'branch office'.

A leadership race is now in full swing, with Mr Murphy and Lothian MSPs Neil Findlay and Sarah Boyack vying for the position.

Speaking before details of the poll emerged, Mr Murphy, the latest candidate to declare, pledged to end the streak of 'losing Labour' in Scotland.

The shadow international development secretary told BBC News he is confident he can turn around the party's fortunes in Scotland and hold the party's current Westminster seats.

He said: 'I'm not interested in left-wing Labour or right-wing Labour, or old Labour or new Labour. I'm interested in losing Labour.

'I want to end that period of losing Labour here in Scotland, starting with the UK general election in 2015, where I'm confident we can hold all the seats we currently have but pick up one or two on top, and also win that election in 2016 for the Scottish Parliament.'

Pledging to unite the party, Mr Murphy said: 'There is so much that has to change about the Labour Party and so much that has to change about our country.

'I'm determined to bring the Labour Party together, end the period of self-harm that we've had in the Scottish Labour Party and get on and improve our country.'

He denied Ms Lamont's claim that the Scottish party has been treated like a branch office.

Mr Murphy said: 'I don't think the Scottish Labour Party has ever been run in that way.

'The Scottish Labour Party takes so many of its own decisions but I want to do more of that. I want to devolve and have a more autonomous Scottish Labour Party.

'I'm confident that I can appeal not just to Scottish Labour voters, not just to trade unions, but to people who are undecided, people who turned away from us in recent elections in Scotland and build that movement for change here in Scotland.'

Former premier Mr Brown ruled himself out of the running in the leadership contest but Mr Murphy plans to meet him to discuss further devolution for the Scottish Parliament.

He said MSPs James Kelly and Jenny Marra will act as joint chairs of his leadership team. He will formally launch his campaign this weekend under the slogan Leading Labour, Changing Scotland.
