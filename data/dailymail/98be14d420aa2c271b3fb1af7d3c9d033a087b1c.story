Pressure: More women have been turning to surgery to help them get back into shape after giving birth

For lots of women, returning to work after childbirth once meant worrying about a new wardrobe for their post-pregnancy figure.

Now, many think it’s a surgeon’s job to get them back in shape – and quickly.

Fearful of returning to work in anything other than a slimline state, growing numbers of new mothers are going under the knife to speedily regain their pre-pregnancy look.

Many are even signing up for ‘two-in-one’ tummy tuck and breast lift surgery, inspired by celebrity mothers who seem to snap back into shape soon after giving birth.

And some are paying up to £10,000 for the package, which was once the preserve of the rich and famous.

Judy Evans, a consultant plastic surgeon at the Circle hospital in Bath, said the two-in-one package is becoming ‘incredibly popular’ with women who are about to return to work after maternity leave.

They have time to have surgery – but not enough to have two separate operations, she told a plastic surgery conference yesterday. However, would-be patients are warned that their bodies will not return to normal instantly and that major surgery requires several weeks of recovery.

Raj Ragoowansi, a Harley Street cosmetic surgeon, said the number of middle-class women coming to him for ‘yummy mummy tummy tucks’ has doubled in the last five years.

He told the annual conference of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons’: ‘Middle-class mums are realising it is a great way of rejuvenating and re-invigorating yourself.

‘After pregnancy, women want to tighten up those bits that tend to go a bit saggy. That is perfectly natural.’

Surgeons say women should wait at least nine months after childbirth before deciding on cosmetic procedures.

Hormonal fluctuations can lead to women making decisions they would later regret, while breast surgery can make it difficult to breast feed. And women must never sign up to have cosmetic surgery at the same time as a Caesarean section, they warn.

Those who rush into cosmetic surgery may also find their cash has been wasted if they decide to have another baby.

Mr Ragoowansi added: ‘If you have the surgery and then have another child the chances are you will need to have it done again.

‘It is best to wait until after you have had all the children you want and then after nine months come to a surgeon.’
