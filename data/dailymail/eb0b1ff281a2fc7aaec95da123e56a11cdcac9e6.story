Abbie Doughty, 18, won £130,000 on the Bingo after she started playing with her mother in Barrow-in-Furness just weeks ago after she turned 18. 

A teenager got herself an extra Christmas present when she won the £130,000 jackpot during her fourth game of bingo.

Abbie Doughty, of Barrow-in-Furness, only started playing bingo a month ago when her mother Annette Taylor introduced her to her favourite game when she turned 18.

But the teenager was shocked when she not only scored a full house, but was also fastest in the country to do so and won with a final number to win the huge jackpot.

The 18-year-old initially thought she had won £101 but then saw her prize escalate as she totted up her score at Apollo Bingo and Social Club in Barrow. 

She described the win as 'like a dream' and said she plans to split her winnings with her mother, who works in a care home. She also plans to give some money to charity.

'Mum and I always split the money 50/50 when we go no matter how much we win,' she said.

'My grandad is sick with cancer so I'm going to give some to a cancer charity and some to a homelessness charity, it's something I don't like to see so I hope I can help.'

Miss Doughty said when she called bingo everyone started screaming and shouting but she did not understand why. 

She added: 'I didn't know what to do, I knew that the full house was for £101 but then the money just kept piling up.

'I got an extra £25,000 for being the first call in the country, meaning I was the first to the full house on the national game.

'Then I found out that I had won on the star number which meant that I won £100,000.

'It was like a dream!'

Miss Doughty managed to net the jackpot because she won £101 for calling a full house and was then awarded an extra £25,000 for being the quickest call  in the country that day, completing her card after just 40 numbers were called.

She was also extra lucky as she called 'full house' on number 80, which had a star on it. Calling full house on a number marked in this way is known as a 'star number', with the prize building up each day to a maximum £250,000 until someone wins it.

When Miss Doughty called full house the prize for the star number had reached £104,000 and the teenager was able to leave with total winnings of £129,419.01 on Sunday evening.

She said: 'Everyone was staring at me and I was nervous, I didn't realise what I had done.

'I'm so thankful to mum for asking me to come along now because it's brilliant to have won.

'She's really excited too though I think she will just spend her half on the house.'

Paul Holland, general manager of the Barrow's Apollo Bingo and Social Club in Hindpool Road, described the atmosphere as 'electric', when the youngster won not only the national full house prize but was the quickest call in the country and also won on the star number.

Workers at the Bingo hall said the large win was quite unusual for Barrow. 

Miss Doughty said she planned to return to the game next week to continue her successful Bingo performance. 

Miss Doughty said she would also like to donate some of her haul to charity after the unexpected win
