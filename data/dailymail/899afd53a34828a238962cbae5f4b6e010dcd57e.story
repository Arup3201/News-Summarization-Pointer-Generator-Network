Wales striker Robert Earnshaw has announced his retirement from international football as he moves to the MLS.

Earnshaw, who won 58 caps, made the announcement after signing a one-year deal for Major League Soccer side Vancouver Whitecaps.

The 33-year-old scored 16 goals for Wales - ranking him joint sixth on the country's all-time list of scorers with Cliff Jones and Mark Hughes - and won his last cap in a 2-0 friendly home defeat to Bosnia-Herzegovina in August 2012.

'It has been a dream come true to have the opportunity to walk out in front of the whole nation and represent Wales in so many important games,' Earnshaw told the official Whitecaps website.

'I am honoured and proud to play for my country for over a decade. I am also extremely thankful for the support I've received over the years from all my Welsh team-mates,coaches, and staff and will be forever grateful because I know I've been in a position that millions dream of.

Zambia-born Earnshaw made his name at Cardiff after growing up in nearby Caerphilly and scored over 100 goals for the Bluebirds before moving on to West Brom, Norwich, Derby and Nottingham Forest for transfer fees totalling over £12.5million.

Earnshaw, who was renowned for his somersault goal-scoring celebration, later returned for a second spell at Cardiff and has had previous MLS experience at Toronto and Chicago Fire as well as playing in Israel for Maccabi Tel Aviv.

On the international front Earnshaw earned cult status by netting a debut winner against Germany in May 2002 and scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 victory over Scotland nearly two years later.
