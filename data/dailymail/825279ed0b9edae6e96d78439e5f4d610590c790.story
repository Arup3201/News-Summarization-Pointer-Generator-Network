San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has launched an extraordinary defence against allegations he sexually harassed a former employee - by claiming he never received sexual harassment training.

The 70-year-old has been accused by his former communications director  Irene McCormack Jackson of sexually harassing her multiple times.

She is one of eight women who have come forward recently with allegations of unwanted sexual advances.

Accused: San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has launched an extraordinary defence against allegations he sexually harassed a former employee - by claiming he never received sexual harassment training

Jackson sued the mayor and the city on July
22, alleging the mayor asked her to work without panties, demanded 
kisses, told her he wanted to see her naked and dragged her in a 
headlock while whispering in her ear.

But it has now emerged that lawyers representing Filner have claimed that if San Diego had provided mandatory sexual harassment training, then Jackson may never have filed the case.

The claims suggest that if Filner is found liable in the claim, he could blame his own city council.

As reported by NBC 7, in a letter, Filner’s lawyer Harvey Berger, said: 'The City has a legal obligation to provide sexual harassment training to all management level employees. The City failed to provide such training to Mayor Filner.

'This is not an excuse for any inappropriate behavior which may have occurred, but I have learned that many – if not most – people do not know what is and what is not illegal sexual harassment under California law.'

On Tuesday, San Diego City Council twice voted unanimously to make Filner responsible for all the expenses in his sexual harassment suit.

The council is attempting to distance itself from the leader of the nation's eighth-largest city amid mounting calls for his resignation.

At its Tuesday night meeting, the City Council voted 9-0 to deny funds for Filner's legal expenses in the lawsuit filed by Jackson.

City councilman Kevin Faulconer said: 'His employers, San Diego taxpayers, did not have to bail him out for the mess he created.'

Earlier in the day in a closed session, the Council voted 9-0 to have the city sue Filner to require that he pay all costs incurred by the lawsuit, which names the city as a defendant in addition to Filner. 

'If Bob Filner engaged in unlawful conduct and the city is held liable, he will have to reimburse us every penny the city pays and its attorney fees,' City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said.

Seven of nine City Council members have urged Filner, the city's first Democratic leader in 20 years, to resign.

Since Jackson filed her lawsuit, seven other women have 
offered detailed accounts of Filner's alleged advances, including 
touching and forcible kisses.

Lisa Curtin, director of government and military education at San Diego City College, said on KPBS-TV Tuesday that the then-congressman asked her in 2011 to remove her wedding band after questioning whether it was real, asked her on a date and moved to kiss her.

She said she felt his tongue on her cheek after she turned her head.

'The City of San Diego maintains a zero tolerance policy as to sexual harassment and sexual harassment is not within the course and scope of employment,' according to the city's lawsuit filed in San Diego Superior Court.

The mayor's office and his attorney, Harvey Berger, didn't immediately respond to requests seeking comment.

Ann Ravel, chairwoman of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, said an official cannot accept more than $440 a year in donated services. 

Campaign money can be used only to defend against alleged violations of the state's campaign finance law. An official can, however, create a legal defense fund under state law, Ravel said.

Filner,
who is divorced, said Friday he would enter two weeks of 'intensive' 
therapy on August 5, defying calls from his own party leaders to resign.

The former 10-term congressman is less than eight months into a four-year term as mayor.

Land-use surveyor Michael Pallamary published a newspaper notice Sunday to begin a recall bid, two days after gay rights activist and newspaper publisher Stampp Corbin did so.

Pallamary accused Corbin of being a stealth supporter of the mayor and threatened to file a complaint with the San Diego County district attorney's office alleging election law violations.

Pallamary said Corbin would make little effort to collect the more than 100,000 signatures needed to get a recall measure on the ballot, setting it up to fail and preventing another recall drive for six months.

Corbin denied the accusation Tuesday, saying Pallamary or anyone else was welcome to join the recall drive.

He
said he wouldn't pay anyone to collect signatures - a common practice 
in California - but that anyone could visit his office to sign the 
petition or pick up blank forms to circulate.

Corbin,
who was appointed chairman of a city commission under Filner, declined 
to say if he voted for Filner or how he would cast his ballot in a 
recall.

He said his motive was to bring swift resolution to the controversy.

'There's nothing going on in the city, in City Hall. Everyone is focused on this scandal. That is not good for this city,' he said.

Confusion over whether recall petitions can circulate concurrently isn't the only procedural flaw uncovered since the mayor came under pressure to resign.

The city attorney's office says a rule that voters must cast a ballot on a recall to be eligible to pick a replacement should be repealed because a federal judge struck down a nearly identical law during the successful 2003 recall of California Gov. Gray Davis.

Tony Krvaric, chairman of the San Diego County Republican Party, said Friday that he didn't expect big GOP donors or business leaders to make significant donations to a recall.
