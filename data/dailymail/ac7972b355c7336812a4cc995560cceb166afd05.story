A 'real-life Mrs Doubtfire' is in jail after allegedly holding up a bank dressed in a bizarre pink dress and fluorescent wig.

Arnell Edwards has been charged with bank robbery after surveillance footage showed him threatening a teller while disguised as a woman.

The alleged crime took place at the U.S. Bank in New Athens, Illinois on Friday morning.

A man reportedly entered the bank building dressed as a woman and handed the teller a note demanding money.

She handed over an undisclosed amount of money to the robber, and he left the building via its main entrance.

Surveillance video showed the man wearing a bright pink dress and similarly garish wig.

He had also donned sunglasses, and held a handkerchief over his mouth.

When local police were alerted to the robbery, they found the wig discarded under a bush just outside the bank.

The dress worn by the man was discovered under an overhang on a nearby garage.

Police identified Edwards, 50, as the suspect, and tracked him down to an apartment block in New Athens.

After a five-hour stand-off, he was taken into custody at the local county jail.

Edwards, from St Louis, Missouri, was later transferred to federal custody where he was charged with one count of bank robbery.
