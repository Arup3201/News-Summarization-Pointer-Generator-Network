Former captain of the New Zealand women's under-19 volleyball team, Teina Boyd, was celebrating Labour weekend with friends, when she dived onto her bed and broke the C5 vertebrae in her neck.

The accident has had devastating consequences for the 28-year-old mum, who now fears she will never walk again.

It is unclear whether  top volleyball player, Teina Boyd, will ever walk again after she fractured her neck in a freak home accident

Ms Boyd was flown from Wellington to Christchurch Hospital where she spent a week in ICU.

She is now recuperating in a rehabilitation centre in Christchurch.

A fundraising page set up by Ms Boy'd friend Nikki Farrell says the young mother is working hard to get the movement back in her body.

So far the page has raised $9,882.00 NZD, which will go towards Ms Boyd's rehabilitation and to ensure Ms Boyd can spend time with her 4-year-old son, who is currently with his father in Auckland. 

'At the moment she can move her arms and her head,' she said.

'You will all be pleased to hear that her sense of humour and positive nature is still present!'

'You all know her as an outgoing, bubbly, enthusiastic, incredible friend and mother so help us show how much we care for her by donating to this page,' she said.

Teina's whanau, including her  son, Willy, are based in Auckland and the Bay of Plenty.

Her brother, Eric, is  with her at the moment while she comes to terms with her condition.

Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, Ms Farrell said the accident was unprecedented and was not willing to accept any thought that her friend may never be able to walk again.

'She dived on to the bed ... and she hit her head and fractured the vertebrae [in her neck],' friend Ms Farrell said.

'She's a bit of a goofy girl and likes to have a bit of a laugh - and that's what happened. It was just a freak accident.'

She said that Ms Boyd has remained positive throughout the ordeal but the avid sports player would be distraught if she could not play volleyball again. 

Ms Boyd was flown from Wellington to Christchurch where she spent a week in ICU

Ms Boyd was born and raised in the settlement of Omaio, east of Opotiki. 

In 2004, she captained the New Zealand women's under-19 volleyball team, however she had recently stopped playing volleyball competitively. 

She has also played for a number of teams in Auckland and in the Bay of Plenty.

Ms Boyd had worked as a bar manager up until the time of her accident.
