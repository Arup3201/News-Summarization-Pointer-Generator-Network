Google is trialling software that could allow it to trace what you buy in bricks and mortar stores back to your computer.

The internet giant is working on a program to prove to companies who advertise on its web pages that their money is persuading customers to make physical purchases.

The software could allow Google to charge more for advertisements and make even more money.

But it will likely raise fresh concerns over privacy with Google, which has a chequered history of handling its users data.

The program works with AdWords, Google’s biggest advertising software, which lets companies put links next to search results.

Google is paid every time somebody clicks through and goes to the company’s website.

The software works by sending an anonymous ‘click ID’ to the advertiser when somebody clicks on an advert.

The person is identified by the advertiser because they will have cookies installed on the user’s computer.

When
 that person buys something in a bricks and mortar store, the retailer is 
able to link them back to their computer using data gleaned from the 
cookie.

The cookie is then matched up with the ‘click ID’, thus telling them how effective their advertising with Google was.

Companies
 who advertise with Google will be able to see the results in a new 
column on their version of the programme which shows in-store sales 
fuelled by Internet advertising, the Wall St Journal reported.

It remains unclear exactly how this will be implemented.

The program, which was first reported by the Wall St Journal, works with AdWords, Google’s biggest advertising software, which lets companies put links next to search results.

Google is paid each time a surfer clicks on an advert and goes to the retailer’s website.

So far, six American companies are taking part in the trial, but that will likely expand if it is a success.

The official title of the programme is In-Store Attribution Transaction Reporting in AdWords,

Google made $50.5 billion revenue last year, almost half of an industry which coins in $117 billion a year.

It also has a stranglehold over the expanding market in Internet searches - two out of every three U.S. web trawls are conducted through Google, with its share rising to 19 out of 20 in Europe.

The giant has sometimes overstepped the mark and in 2011 agreed to pay $500 million to settle a U.S. Department of Justice investigation.

Google had been accused of allowing Canadian drug companies to advertise on U.S. web pages, meaning drugs not authorised for America were being sold there.

Rivals such as Microsoft have long complained it impedes competition by blocking rival products from coming up near the top of its searches, an allegation Google has denied.

In Britain, Google caused outrage when with its Streetview service in which cars with 360 degree cameras drove around streets filming people’s homes.

It later emerged that for the three years Google was filming it was also collecting data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks.

After the issue caused a huge row in Germany, Google was forced to stop filming for Streetview there.

Residents in the village of Broughton in Cambridgeshire also took matters into their own hands when they saw a Google Street View car by forming a human chain to block its path.

MailOnline has contacted Google for comment.

A spokesman told the Wall St Journal that Google never knows the identity of the user.

He said: ‘We are running a number of tests to help clients use their own sales data to measure how their search campaigns impact sales’.
