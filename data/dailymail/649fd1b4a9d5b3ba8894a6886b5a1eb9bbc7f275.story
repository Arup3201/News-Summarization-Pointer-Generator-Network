A group of students banded together to drown out the sermons of an anti-gay preacher in front of the Carrier Library at John Madison University in Virginia, America.

The incident was captured on camera and shows a young man playing a guitar while other students sing Christian song How He Loves at the man.

On the footage, the preacher is heard saying: 'I see through you all,' as he tries to do battle with the voices of the students.

But they continue to sing as one and pay him no attention. The guitar-playing student dogs the preacher's footsteps as the man tries to speak to the growing crowd.

Every time the man speaks, the group raise their volume, so that his voice cannot be heard.

They keep chanting the refrain 'Oh how he loves us' louder and louder. 

The man turns his back on them and continues to talk but can barely be heard.

The student ended the song by shouting 'Jesus loves you all,' to the crowd

The video zooms in as the Bible-holding preacher engages a student in conversation.

A police officer looks on as more students gather to film the scene on their mobile phones.

The video currently has more than 30,000 shares on YouTube and the website's users are engaging in an intense theological debate over the actions of the students.

Some users hit out at the students' action, saying that although they disagreed with homophobia, they also believed in the freedom of speech.

Piers Echols-Jones posted: 'On the one hand, I'm not down with the homophobia. On the other hand, it's the tyranny of the majority to shut up a person by drowning them out.'

User Daniel Yang said: 'The preacher claims to be spreading the Gospel but all he does is spew hate and doctrine that is opposite of Christianity.

'At least the students didn't argue back and start up a messy fuss but instead returned in music and worship.' 

Another YouTube user, John Howard said: 'A group of people (obviously united in love) are protecting another group of people plagued by judgement and hatred. This is a beautiful scene.' 

In another video on YouTube, published on the same day, a woman is heard in the background, saying: ‘I do listen to Jesus Christ. I was going to Catholic school for most of my life.’

But the preacher replies with: ‘You’re growing up in a screwy religion, you've been raised in a screwy religion.'
