First-half goals from Rohan Ince and Kazenga LuaLua put Brighton on their way to a comfortable Capital One Cup victory at League Two outfit Burton Albion - and a fourth round trip to Spurs. 

Ince gave the Seagulls the lead after 18 minutes with a lovely header on the night second cousin Tom Ince scored his first goal for Hull. 

It was his second goal in this season's competition after the midfielder scored in the round two win at Swindon.

Lua-Lua doubled Brighton's lead with a sensational goal eight minutes before the break. 

He weaved in from the left, beat two men and smashed the ball into the back of the net, reviving echoes of his older brother, former Newcastle and Portsmouth star Lomana. 

Craig Mackail-Smith clinched the passage for Sami Hyypia's men halfway through the second half. 

The Scotland international striker hooked in his third goal of the season to snuff out any possibility of a Brewers comeback.

It was a good night at the office for Brighton boss Sami Hyypia 

Burton failed to clear a Brighton corner and Mackail-Smith hooked in Paddy McCourt's cross. 

The hosts had their chances but Brighton were comfortably the better team and made the two-division gulf in class tell. 

But Inigo Calderon took some of the gloss of the victory for a late red card after kicking out at Burton's Robbie Weir with two minutes remaining. 

And there was still time for time for Callum McFadzean to hit the post for the Brewers in stoppage time.  

Gary Rowett's team can now concentrate on their League Two promotion campaign - they are currently second behind Wycombe Wanderers in the table. 

And the Capital One Cup run comes as a welcome distraction for Hyypia, who won the trophy twice as a player with Liverpool. 

It has been an inconsistent start for the Seagulls in the Championship and they have taken only eight points from their first eight games.
