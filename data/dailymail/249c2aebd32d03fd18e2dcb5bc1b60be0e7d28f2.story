A mother claims her five-year-old daughter lost part of her finger  in a fire door at school after she was left unsupervised.

Margaret Chan said the young girl needed  surgery after getting her finger caught in the door at Cuddington Croft Primary in Cheam, Surrey.

The girl's angry parents added that their daughter had been left unattended when the agonising accident occurred.

The tip of the young girl's finger (left) had to be surgically reattached and it will take the five-year-old (right) three months to recover

Surgeons operated on January 19 to try and reattach the severed tip of the finger but medics say it will take the girl three months to recover.

Mrs Chan, who lives with her husband and two daughters, are now planning to withdraw their children from the school because of its handling of the situation.

'She got sent back into the school building toilet alone unsupervised via a classroom where there are two fire doors,' said the mother-of-two.

'One of which amputated her finger tip. We went to see the school to understand what had happened.

'No one could tell us as it was 'unwitnessed' was they all said.'

Despite reassurances from the school that they had fixed the problem, Mrs Chan said that when she personally went to investigate the fire doors, she found they were still dangerously slamming shut.
