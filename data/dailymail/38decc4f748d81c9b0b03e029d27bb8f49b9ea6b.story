Art lovers have only a few months to raise £2.74m to prevent the historic Wedgwood Collection being sold off.

The collection, which spans more than 250 years of the pottery firm's history, includes more than 80,000 works of art, ceramics and photographs as well as paintings by George Stubbs and Joshua Reynolds.

Its future has been in doubt since Waterford Wedgwood Potteries collapsed in 2009 with a £134 million pension debt which threatened the future of the museum where the collection was kept.

For complex legal reasons, the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire, that houses the collection became liable for the pension debt, which threatened its future. 

A deal has been done to save the collection and more than £13 million has already been raised but it could be broken up and sold on the open market unless the final £2.74 million is found by the end of November.

Wedgwood traces its history back to 1759 when Josiah Wedgwood started work as a potter in Staffordshire.

His work transformed the firm from a cottage industry into an international success story and one of the world's most famous names in pottery.

If the money can be raised, the collection will be gifted to London's Victoria and Albert Museum and then loaned back to the local museum which is being redeveloped.

Tim Reeve, chief operating officer of the Victoria and Albert Museum, said: 'Wedgwood has a unique place in Britain's ceramic history and in the industrial history of the nation.

'Josiah Wedgwood was a true pioneer, transforming British pottery from a minor craft to a major industry through a combination of scientific experimentation, development of new ceramic materials and techniques, excellence in design and a genius for marketing and business.

'The Wedgwood Collection contains not only some of the finest ceramics produced in Britain over the last 250 years but is also the most complete documentation of factory production in the country.

'It would be a tragedy for the Collection to be dispersed and we sincerely hope the funds can be raised to secure it for the nation. The V&A stands ready to safeguard the collection for future generations.'
