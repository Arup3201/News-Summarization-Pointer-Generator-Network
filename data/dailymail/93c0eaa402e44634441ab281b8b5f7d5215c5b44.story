A conwoman has been sent to prison after a distraction burglary on an elderly woman – who turned out to be an MP’s mother.

Callous: Leanne Smith, a conwoman has been jailed after a distraction burglary on an elderly woman - who turned out to be an MP's mother

Leanne Smith, 34, knocked on the door of Connie Morris, the mother of Grahame Morris, Labour MP for Easington in Durham, and asked to borrow a tea bag.

She was then invited in for a cup of tea and once inside the 77-year-old’s house, Smith took precious and irreplaceable property including wedding and engagement rings.

But she was caught after one of the pensioner’s family reported it to the police.

Smith, who has a previous conviction for forcing her way in to another pensioner’s home during a robbery, was sentenced to four years behind bars.

Prosecutor Simon Worthy told Newcastle Crown Court how Smith went to the pensioner’s house last July, asking to borrow a tea bag.

The victim told police that she lived by the philosophy of doing ‘a good deed every day’ so decided to invite in Smith, who she recognised from the neighbourhood.

Smith, from Murton, Co Durham, distracted her by claiming there was a knock on the door, knowing there was nobody there and buying herself time to take what she wanted.

The grandmother-of-two discovered her bag, which contained £100 in cash, jewellery and her inhalers, was gone after a relative called to say that the bag had been found in a bin.

The widow, whose husband Richard died 25 years ago, then realised her jewellery and other goods were gone.

In a statement read to court, Mrs Morris said: ‘She conned her way in and stole personal items which had great sentimental value

‘She had no thought or regard for the street and anxiety she has caused and she’s not once expressed any remorse.

‘Those items, such as wedding and engagement rings, are irreplaceable to me.

‘The financial value is immaterial; those rings were given to me by my husband, who has passed away.

‘She has given no thought of what those items meant to me, nothing can replace what those items meant to me.

‘She has not disclosed where she sold them so I can try to find them. If she felt genuine remorse she would help me recover what she stole.

‘The loss of the items has devastated me. I think she deserves significant prison time.’

Her son Grahame added: ‘It’s very upsetting when it’s your own family and I hope that other elderly people will learn from this
