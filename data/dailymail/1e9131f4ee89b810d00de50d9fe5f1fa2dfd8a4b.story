Jose Mourinho blamed the referee for turning Chelsea’s pre-season preparations into a ‘circus’ as the Blues lost 3-0 to Werder Bremen.

Referee Harm Osmers, from Hannover, gave two soft penalties to the home side – one for a handball by John Terry and another for a Nathan Ake last-ditch tackle – and Mourinho was unimpressed, calling both decisions ‘nonsense’.

The heavy loss on German soil ends this two-week leg of the Blues’ European pre-season tour with their first defeat and they fly back to London on Sunday night with Mourinho feeling disappointed with the way things have gone.

VIDEO Chelsea need games - Mourinho  

‘I learned nothing from this game,’ Mourinho said. ‘Our expectations are not fulfilled because when we decided to have this match here in Bremen we thought about an evolution in difficulty.

‘We were expecting a fast game a competitive game but we come here and the referee thought this was a circus for Bremen fans – for them to have fun - and he killed the match.

‘This game for us would have been perfect. I like the Werder Bremen team - they are fast, intense and they defend with a lot of people. The opponent is perfect for is to compete today but we couldn't play.’

The Portuguese coach felt Osmers disrupted the game and made it a pointless exercise for his side.

Run outs: Cesc Fabregas and Kurt Zouma both got valuable match time under their belts 

Chelsea often found their attacks broken up by the referee’s whistle and struggled to create chances despite the likes of Cesc Fabregas – who played 90 minutes - and Eden Hazard – a second half substitute – being on the field.

‘Every foul, he gave a free kick against us to stop the game - and when we had advantage he stopped the game for a free kick which stopped us playing.

‘The penalties, especially the last one, were nonsense.

‘I am disappointed with that because we want to train and the referee didn't let us have a good session.'

Mourinho later told Chelsea TV: 'The referee gave the penalty against Ake to finish his job in this beautiful party because it was a beautiful party for Werder Bremen.

'When the referee behaves this one did, this is not a friendly anymore.'
