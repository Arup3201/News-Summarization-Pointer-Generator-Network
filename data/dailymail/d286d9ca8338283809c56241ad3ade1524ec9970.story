Ceri Leigh, 50, suffers from post-traumatic stress after paramedics arrived 17 minutes late to treat her dislocated knee

A former boss at the Natural History Museum has won a six-figure payout after paramedics arrived late to treat her severely injured knee.

Ceri Leigh, 50, developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after dislocating her knee on the bus home from work in 2008. Paramedics were 17 minutes late in reaching her.

Mrs Leigh argued that the extreme pain she was in and the length of the wait meant she developed the condition which left her suffering flashbacks, nightmares, a high level of anxiety and depression, and seizures.

Today a Judge sitting at London's High Court awarded her £522,379 after she was forced to retire from her job as exhibitions organiser at the museum.

Mrs Leigh said spent a total of 50 minutes trapped between seats on the bus Near Wimbledon station in extreme pain.

Fellow passengers tried to help and had to hold her down in order to stop her moving.

Mrs Leigh said she could not sit or stand and was screaming in agony. Every additional minute added to the trauma of her experience until she felt 'utter despair'.

Mrs Leigh said she felt trapped, was shaking violently, became unable to hold her mind together, remembered 'no longer knowing who she was' and went 'into a freeze'.

Eventually paramedics arrived, treated her with painkiller and manipulated the leg back into place, but by then the long-term damage was done.

She did not recover full function in the knee for about 18 months and became housebound.

Mrs Leigh was forced to take medical retirement from the job she loved in 2011 after she began to suffer from dissociative seizures, which cause her body to go numb and collapse.

She appeared at the High Court via webcam to save her the trauma of travelling from her new home in South Wales, but the stress was enough to cause a seizure during cross-examination.

Mrs Leigh suffered the dislocated knee after getting on a bus near Wimbledon station. As a result of her delayed treatment she developed PTSD which meant she had to quit her job after suffering seizures

The judge said: 'She has continuing PTSD which flashbacks, nightmares and dissociative seizures.

'In the flashbacks, she finds herself back on the bus experiencing the pain and anxiety she felt at the time.

'The nightmares occur nightly, breaking her sleep pattern and leaving her exhausted.

'The dissociative seizures unexpectedly cause her body to go numb and she collapses. She suffers a collapse most days.

'She remains conscious but feels nothing and is unable to move or speak.

'She is unable to travel outside on her own. She is largely housebound. When she goes outside with a family member, she may suddenly collapse in the street.

'She find it difficult to concentrate, plan and action ordinary activities such as housework and mentally tends to go round and round in circles. She becomes easily overwhelmed.'

While the ambulance service agreed that paramedics had been late to arrive at the scene, they disputed that the trauma of having to wait caused the PTSD, and disagreed over the level of compensation.

Their lawyers said that, during 2010 and 2011, she had other stresses including problems with marital communications, worry about whether her husband would be made redundant, financial problems, her son’s trans-gender issues, her daughter’s issues about her adoption and the pressures of litigation.

Mrs Leigh worked at the Natural History Museum until her seizures forced her to take medical retirement

The judge disagreed and said that the delay made a 'material contribution' to the development of her PTSD.

He added: 'There are innumerable variables in the circumstances that will give rise to the development of such a disorder and in the people who are likely to suffer it.

'It is impossible to predict on any scientific or mathematical basis the moment after which someone will go on to suffer it.'

He said he was satisfied that the seizures were all part of the PTSD and consequent upon it and were not related to other stresses in her life.

The judge said he had no hesitation in accepting that Mrs Leigh’s injury was severe as all aspects of her life were badly affected and additional therapy was expected to make only a minimal improvement.
