Vicky Pryce walked free from prison yesterday – and promptly announced she had signed a book deal.

Miss Pryce promised the book, which will be published later this year, would be ‘more than a memoir’.

She said it would include her account of the two months she spent behind bars for perverting the course of justice by taking her ex-husband Chris Huhne’s speeding points.

'More than a memoir': Vicky Pryce arrives at her home in Clapham, South London, yesterday, where she told waiting reporters she had signed a publishing deal for a book about her time behind bars

The book, Prisonomics, will be published in hardback and sell for £16.99 a copy. Miss Pryce, 60, kept a diary while in jail and was pictured carrying a distinctive notebook.

She said the book would cover her views on the prison system and how it treats women.

But readers will no doubt be more interested in the prospect of further revelations about her relationship with the former Cabinet Minister.

But any profits from the book, which will be published by Biteback, could be seized by the authorities.

Under laws which came into force in 2010 as part of the Coroners and Justice Act, police can seize the proceeds of books seen to be ‘exploiting’ an offender’s criminal past.

Critics urged the authorities to examine the case closely.

Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention said: ‘Many people will find it distasteful for a criminal to announce a book deal on the day she is released.

‘Self-serving memoirs by former prisoners are nearly always a bad thing.

'They are offensive to victims of crime and often glamorise the criminal lifestyle, leading some to believe crime is the route to respect and wealth.’

Yesterday a spokesman for her publisher refused to comment on what subjects the title would cover, saying ‘she hasn’t written the book yet’.

Her first book, Greekonomics, was about the economic crisis.

After Lord Archer was freed in 2003 after serving two years for perjury, he is believed to have made £15million from a three-book deal for his prison diaries.

Shamed former Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken reportedly received an £80,000 advance for his autobiography, Pride And Perjury, after he was released in 2000.
