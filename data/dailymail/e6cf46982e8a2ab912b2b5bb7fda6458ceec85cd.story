Any fan of Dr Who knows the most astonishing thing about the Tardis (apart from its ability to travel through space and time) is that it's bigger on the inside.

Now one imaginative fan has created his own DIY Tardis with this amazing feature, thanks to the nifty use of augmented reality (AR).

Greg Kumparak, based in silicon valley in California, first set out to build a simple model of the famous police box after becoming bored over Thanksgiving.

Innovative: Mr Kumparak used an augmented reality app to make his model Tardis appear bigger on the inside when pointing his smartphone at it

The technology wizard removed the front door of his mini Tardis and replaced it with patterned material, to allow smartphone software to latch on to the model

He created it over a few hours using wood, two bottles and some dark blue paint, before fixing a working red light on the top.

'Then my stupid brain went and thought 'Hey wouldn't it be cool if it had an interior,' Mr Kumparak wrote on his blog.

But how to defy the laws of physics and make it bigger on the inside?

First he created a 3D computer model of the interior using a free-to-use open source computer software programme called Blender. He said it was a rough likeness to how it appeared during David Tennant's turn as the Time Lord from 2005 to 2010.

The former Techcrunch mobile editor then used the Unity graphics rendering engine. Rendering is the process of generating a 2D image from a 3D model stored in a scene file by using a computer program. This information describes the geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting and shading of the virtual scene.

The interior if the TARDIS is the same as the one featured during David Tennant's time as the Doctor. Here he's pictured with Freema Agyeman who played Martha Jones

Finally he used an AR app platform by chip-maker Qualcomm called Vuforia, to allow a smartphone to interact with the mini Tardis.

For this to work the smartphone software needed to latch on to part of the model so it could map out an appropriate view of the interior.

Mr Kumparak tried to use the 'Free for use of Public' sign on the front as the marker but found it was too small.

In the end he took off the front door and replaced it with a piece of material with a 'time-warp' style black and white pattern. The software then used this to work out at what angle the interior image should be shown.

The result, as his YouTube video shows, is an impressive optical illusion.

Reaction to the invention online has been extremely favourable, with one fan even claiming Mr Kumparak had made his Christmas.

'The feedback has been resoundingly positive so far,' Mr Kumparak told the BBC.

'Almost shockingly so, really. Doctor Who fans might be some of the nicest people on the internet.'
