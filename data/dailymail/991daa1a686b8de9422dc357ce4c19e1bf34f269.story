Charlie Wheeler's loved ones knew him for his love of tank tops, hatred of haircuts and a taste for the silly - and now, thanks to an uplifting obituary, the whole country knows him that way, too.

In a tribute that has since become an internet hit, his family has painted a hilarious picture of the 60-year-old father-of-two who passed away in New Hampshire on November 16.

'Charles "Charlie" Wheeler, 60, of Weare, kicked the bucket, bought the farm and ate his last pretzel on Nov. 16, 2014,' the obituary begins. 

It recalls how he was 'notorious for his numerous sound effects, sense of humor, and easy smile' as well as his skills as a 'house fix-upper' and 'putterer'. 

Remembered: Charlie Wheeler, 60, pictured, passed away last week - and his wife and two children have commemorated him by writing a hilarious obituary that has since gone viral

'Charlie's many talents included repairing cars and motorcycles, riding his Harley, barbecuing and hanging around the fire pit,' it continues.

'Best known for his fashion sense, Charlie consistently wore white tube socks, tank tops, shorts, flannel shirts, fleece vests, a sweaty baseball cap, and raggedy, barely wearable sneakers.'

It remembers how he loved Christmas, the Three Stooges,  his German Shepherds and feeding the birds but hated snow blowing 'and took such joy in dumping snow on his kids'.

'He was a hard-working man, loyal, silly, kind, gentle, respectful and incredibly generous,' it finishes.

The obituary seemed the only suitable way to pay tribute to Wheeler, said his wife of 32 years, Annie Pleatsikas, his daughter Meredith, 22, and son Evan, 26.

'We did it because we thought it was so appropriate to do something funny and humorous and to paint a picture of him,' his wife Annie told WMUR. 'He was just hilarious.' 

After his obituary was published, it was shared by people moved by the touching tribute, with hundreds commenting on what a great man he seemed to be.

'I wish I had known you, Charlie,' one reader from Ohio wrote beneath the obituary. 'You are my kind of person....live, love, laugh! I'm sure you will be missed by all who knew you.'

'They always say "He's in a better place", but I think Charlie made "here" a better place,' another added.

Loved: Charlie, pictured with his children, was remembered as a hard-working and loyal man with a great sense of humor. Readers of the obituary commented on how they would've liked to have known him

His daughter, Meredith, added to WMUR: 'People say they were laughing, crying, laughing and then crying more. I think that's a better way to read an obit than crying the whole time.'

Annie said she is glad her children are smiling at the happy memories with their father.

'I think in the coming days, it's going to bring us more comfort,' she said. 'They will always remember this.'
