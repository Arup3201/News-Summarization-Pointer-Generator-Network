Roy Keane was involved in a training-ground row with Aston Villa players 24 hours before his sudden exit from the club.

Keane left Villa Park after five months as Paul Lambert’s assistant on Friday claiming he could no longer combine the job with his role as No 2 to Republic of Ireland boss Martin O’Neill.

But Sportsmail understands that tensions between Keane and several senior players have been simmering for some time. A club insider said there was a bust-up at their Bodymoor Heath training ground on Thursday which began during the session and is thought to have continued afterwards.

Keane and Lambert are said to have held talks later in the day and come to an amicable decision that it was better for the 43-year-old former Manchester United star to leave. The Villa players were informed of Keane’s exit by text message shortly before the club issued a statement.

The official reason that Keane was leaving to focus on his international commitments has been questioned in some quarters because Ireland do not play again until March.

His relationship with several players is said to have become strained with Keane struggling to accept what he felt was a lack of intensity in training.

Ings’s fourth goal in five games means that he has scored more times than the whole Aston Villa team since the start of October. 

Keane left Ireland’s World Cup camp in Saipan in 2002 in a row over training facilities, and departed United shortly after a similar falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson and Carlos Queiroz on a pre-season trip to Portugal three years later.

When contacted on Sunday night, Villa denied reports of the bust-up or that there was any issue between senior players and Keane, but questions about the Irishman were banned in the press conference after Saturday’s draw at Burnley.

Joe Cole scored his first goal for Villa at Turf Moor. The former England and Chelsea player turned down lucrative offers from abroad and took a pay cut to move to Villa Park on a free transfer from West Ham in the summer.

‘This is what it’s all about, playing in the Premier League,’ he said. ‘I could have gone and filled my pockets, but the fire still burns for me.’
