A doctor put a 'Do Not Resuscitate' notice on a great-grandfather without any consultation as she believed it would have caused 'unnecessary distress' to discuss the plan with him.

Michael Richardson, 66, a former metal polisher and gardener, died at James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on October 27 2013. 

He had been ill for several years with the lung condition pulmonary fibrosis.

His widow Janet, 66, accused medics of 'playing God with his life' when she discovered the DNR notice had been placed on him without consultation.

Dr Anna Blackburn, a consultant specialising in respiratory medicine at the hospital, said she made the decision when he was admitted on October 24, as attempting to save him would have been 'futile' and 'cruel' 

In the inquest into his death today, Dr Anna Blackburn, a consultant specialising in respiratory medicine at the hospital, said she made the decision when he was admitted on October 24.

She said Mr Richardson, from Great Yarmouth, had little chance of surviving a cardiac arrest and attempting to save him would have been 'futile and cruel'.  

'I sat down and thought long and hard about it.

'We had discussed his condition, he cried and he seemed quite upset about how it would affect his wife.

'I felt bringing up resuscitation would be even more distressing for him', she said. 

Patient confidentiality meant she could not approach Mr Richardson's family without first talking to him.

The inquest heard the hospital's policy at the time said it was not necessary to discuss a DNR decision if it would be 'unnecessarily burdensome' for the patient.

The hospital's policy was not to discuss such a decision if it would be 'unnecessarily burdensome' for the patient. 

This was changed in light of a 2014 Court of Appeal ruling and now states patients should be informed of the decision, unless this would cause physical harm. 

Dr Blackburn added: 'If I was faced with Mr Richardson today, I would have that discussion.'

Mrs Richardson challenged the doctor in the inquest, saying: 'My husband had a lot to live for even if it was for another week - I'm sorry your decision was very, very wrong.'

Yesterday, hospital staff described how they had initially rushed to save Mr Richardson after he suffered a cardiac arrest. But they stopped when the DNR notice was brought to their attention.

Giving evidence, Mrs Richardson said her husband tried to discharge himself the day before his death.

'He said, "I can't breathe, take me home - I can't stand it any more. They're trying to kill me",' she added.

'I said, "I love you", and then he said he loved me too. That was the last time I saw him alive.

'I wish I'd bundled him up and taken him home because at least if he was going to die, he was going to die with some dignity.'

The inquest continues.
