Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen is considering his future over fears regarding his role in Mauricio Pochettino's plans.

The Belgian has established the reputation of being one of the Premier League's best defenders since arriving from Ajax in 2012.

But he has struggled under Pochettino and is no longer an automatic choice for Spurs.

And his frustration has led Vertonghen to weigh up his potential options away from White Hart Lane.

Sources have also told Sportsmail that the relationship between Pochettino and Vertonghen isn't what it could be, contributing to the Belgian's current mindset.

The defender is under no immediate rush to leave north London, but would find it hard to turn down a Champions League side.

Despite not being an automatic choice, Spurs are unlikely to entertain offers for Vertonghen in January.

Spurs are under little pressure to sell Vertonghen given his current deal expires in 2018.
