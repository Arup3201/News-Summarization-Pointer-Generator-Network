Real Madrid funded the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema by selling Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben, and last season Gonzalo Higuain and Mesut Ozil made way for Gareth Bale, so who goes where and for what price this summer after the £84million arrival of Kroos and Rodriguez?

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wenger with unfinished transfer business

Revolving door: Karim Benzema, Sami Khedira and Angel Di Maria could all be heading for the Real Madrid exit

SAMI KHEDIRA

WANTED BY: Arsenal, Chelsea

PRICE: £18million

Real Madrid put a 20m price tag on Sami Khedira at the start of the summer but with only one year left on his contract they might drop that closer to deadline day.

Jose Mourinho is a big admirer of the 27-year-old and Arsene Wenger is also interested but whether either will pay £150,000-per-week for his services could be another matter entirely. He might have to drop his price too.

On the move: Sami Khedira has not signed a new deal at Real Madrid and is set to leave

World Cup winner: The German has been linked with a move to Arsenal and Chelsea

DIEGO LOPEZ / IKER CASILLAS

WANTED BY: Lopez: Monaco / Casillas: Arsenal, Liverpool

PRICE: £12/15million

When Keylor Navas signs (most probably next week) Real Madrid will have three top goalkeepers and even Carlo Ancelotti can’t come up with a plan that keeps all of them happy. Casillas’ form in the Champions League final and at the World Cup was down largely to a season on the bench for league games.

He will not want a repeat of that. As things stand neither nor Lopez nor Casillas have pushed for a move but Monaco are pushing for Lopez and Casillas would leave for a Premier League adventure.

On the way out? Diego Lopez is back in training but his stay at Madrid could be cut short by a transfer

Down and out: Madrid won't want Iker Casillas continuing his poor form from the World Cup at club level

ANGEL Di MARIA

WANTED BY: Monaco, Manchester United, Manchester City

PRICE: £40million

Monaco owner Dmitry Rybolovlev was at James Rodriguez’ presentation yesterday presumably not just to wave goodbye to one of his assets. The Russian will want to fill the void left by his star player and Di Maria fits the bill, he is even represented by Jorge Mendes who moved Rodriguez from Ligue One to La Liga.

After his sensational season last year Monaco will not be the only club interested in a player who played wide in a 4-3-3 and in a 4-4-2 reaching the World Cup final and winning the European Cup final.

Angel pursuit: Monaco and both Manchester clubs are keen to sign Angel Di Maria

Top form: Di Maria had an excellent season for Real Madrid last year, including helping to win 'la decima'

ISCO

WANTED BY: Manchester City

PRICE: £30million

When Manuel Pellegrini’s Malaga took on Porto in the Champions League two seasons ago Rodriguez had a quiet match for Porto while Isco stole the show for Malaga. No-one did more for the midfielder’s career than the current Manchester City manager and he was very close to moving to the Etihad Stadium last summer but Madrid promised him the world and he changed his mind.

This season Rodriguez will have to play ahead of Isco and it’s difficult to see how both might play together. There might be a different response if Pellegrini came calling again.

Wanted man: Manchester City could bid for Real Madrid midfielder Isco this summer

Back in action: Isco (left) is back training with Real but he could find his opportunities limited next season

KARIM BENZEMA / RAPHAEL VARANE / PEPE

WANTED BY: Benzema: Arsenal, Liverpool / Varane: Chelsea / Pepe: Manchester City

PRICE: £40million/£30million/£20million

It’s unlikely these three will move because they would then need to be replaced whereas the aforementioned would not. But Real Madrid’s revolving door transfer policy is often driven by demand. So if a big bid came in then it would be considered.

Impressing: A series of good performances at the World Cup means Karim Benzema is not short of suitors

Class act: Raphael Varane is exactly the sort of defender that Jose Mourinho is in the market for

We want you to stay: Pepe isn't necessarily on the market but a big bid could convince Madrid to sell
