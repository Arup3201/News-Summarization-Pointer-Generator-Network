A father-of-three died from a heart attack the day after being sent home from hospital by an inexperienced nurse who misdiagnosed his chest pains as high blood pressure.

Terry Best, 46, was pronounced dead after he was found slumped in his car outside a garden centre on November 28 last year.

The previous day he had stopped off at the minor injuries unit at Whitworth Community Hospital in Matlock, Derbyshire, after getting chest pains while driving to work.

Despite showing sky-high blood pressure, an emergency nurse did not have enough experience to interpret an ECG heart scan properly.

Mr Best was discharged just 25 minutes later and told to attend his GP instead of being referred for emergency care which may have saved his life.

He was able to make an appointment with his doctor for the next evening but collapsed and died in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, earlier that day.

An inquest at Milton Keynes Coroner’s Court in May concluded there had been a failure by the nurse to refer Mr Best for emergency care which resulted in a lost opportunity for him to receive necessary treatment.

His wife Kerry Best, 40, who lived with Terry in Moseley, Birmingham, said NHS staff had let her husband down.

She said: 'I knew Terry must be feeling very unwell for him to take himself to hospital as he was never one to make a fuss.

'I was relieved when he phoned to say he had been seen as I thought at least now he was in safe hands.

'To hear at the inquest that more could have been done to help him was very difficult to comprehend and I’m still struggling to come to terms with it now.

'I can’t understand why the emergency nurse allowed Terry to go home, it seems like common sense to me, that someone with central chest pains requires urgent treatment.

'I believe that the nurse was too reliant on a poorly drafted protocol.

'Terry was so full of life and a devoted husband and father.'

Sent home: Terry Best was pronounced dead after he was found slumped in his car last year

Mr Best, who worked as a manager for a large garden centre company, had suffered with high blood pressure and high cholesterol for some time.

He first began to experience intermittent chest pains, dizziness and pins and needles in his left arm in November last year.

He decided to go to hospital on November 28 after the chest pains, which would occur approximately every 30 minutes, came on particularly strong as he drove to work.

At his inquest, Senior Coroner for Milton Keynes Tom Osborne recommended that Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Trust implement a revised ‘Unwell Adult Protocol’ for patients with chest pain to ensure they received emergency care.

Shortly after the death, the Trust commenced a ‘Serious Incident Investigation’ to ensure that lessons were learned.

The investigation highlighted that they required more explicit protocols in place to ensure that adults with chest pains were treated appropriately.

The Trust has now confirmed it has revised its ‘Unwell Adult Protocol’ for patients with chest pains to prevent further deaths.

Mrs Best now wants the protocol to be implemented in all community hospitals nationwide to ensure all patients with chest pains have access to the appropriate treatment as quickly as possible.

 'It gives me some peace of mind to know that the Trust has revised and implemented its protocol, as encouraged by the coroner, but it won’t bring Terry back'

Mrs Best, his wife of 11-years, who is also the mother to two of Terry’s children aged 18 and 11, said: 'It gives me some peace of mind to know that the Trust has revised and implemented its protocol, as encouraged by the coroner, but it won’t bring Terry back.

'We are determined to see justice for what has happened and hope that the Trust will now work with our legal team to conclude our case so the children have financial security and we can begin the very long process of rebuilding our lives.'

Adam Wright, a medical law expert at Irwin Mitchell lawyers, which is representing Mr Best's family, said: 'This is a tragic case that has left Kerry struggling to come to terms with the loss of her husband and three children without their dad.

'We are pleased that the Trust has now implemented a revised protocol for adults presenting with chest pains, albeit too late for Terry.

'We will now continue to investigate on Kerry’s behalf, whether Terry would not have died if he had received emergency treatment.

'We are also looking to secure the family financial security for the future; given Terry was the main breadwinner.

'The NHS must continually strive to learn lessons from any shortcomings and make improvements to its services as a whole to provide the best possible care.

'We believe that the revised "Unwell Adult Protocol" should be implemented nationwide, in all Community Hospitals, so that every adult patient with chest pains who might present at such a centre is safeguarded and referred for specialist treatment that could save their life.'
