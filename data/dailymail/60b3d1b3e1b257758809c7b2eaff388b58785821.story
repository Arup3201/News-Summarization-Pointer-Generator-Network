As the youngest contestants in this year’s competition, they may not have the experience of their rival for the glittery trophy.

But Harry Judd and Chelsee Healey will leave Jason Donovan in the shade at the Strictly Come Dancing final, according to judge Alesha Dixon, who has predicted it will be a youthful two-horse race.

Judd, 25, drummer with the pop band McFly, is the bookies’ favourite to win tomorrow night – despite the fact that his competition, actress Miss Healey, 23, and singer Donovan, 43, achieved perfect 40 scores for dances last week.

Miss Dixon said: ‘It will either be Chelsee or Harry. Chelsee is a brilliant dancer but I think a lot of women have a soft spot for Harry.’

Prediction: Alesha Dixon appeared on the Graham Norton show where she said either Harry or Chelsee would win

In an interview for Graham Norton’s BBC 
talk-show, screened tonight, she also defended her criticism of Nancy 
Dell’Olio earlier in the series. The Italian-American lawyer has 
threatened to sue her over her comments.

Miss Dixon claims the former partner of Sven Goran Eriksson had taken it more ‘personally’ because she was also a woman.  

She said: ‘My criticism wasn’t personal, it was funny...She was upset I think because I am the female judge.’

Miss Dixon claimed she could tell when couples had ‘crossed the line’ on the show when it came to chemistry. The singer added: ‘When they are right in front of you, you can read the way they look at each other.

‘I love that bit of it. I loved it when Kara and Artem got together. They were the real deal, genuinely falling in love.’

She said Strictly’s popularity was down to the fact it was ‘warm and fluffy’ escapism.

And Donovan said yesterday that the show’s success was ‘all about the cast’, saying it was like a ‘soap opera’ and a ‘panto’.

This series, the formula appears to 
have worked as the show has frequently pulled in bigger audiences than 
its Saturday night rival, ITV’s The X Factor.

The
hotly awaited finale is expected to achieve record ratings, with the 
BBC optimistic that it can break the 14million mark for its average 
audience – and more at its peak.

Gruelling: Jason described the competition as 'the hardest thing I have ever done'

Sunday’s X Factor final had an average audience of 12.9million viewers.

Yesterday, the Strictly finalists spoke in London ahead of the show at Blackpool’s Tower Ballroom.

Judd
admitted that he had become a fan of fake tan during his time on the 
show, saying it put him in the ‘mood and mind-set’ to dance.

The finalists attended a press call in London ahead of Saturday night's final in Blackpool which is expected to achieve record ratings of around 14m

Once it was over, though, he said he was ‘going to go home and see my mum and dad and just hibernate for the winter’.

Donovan said that he too would be dedicating time over Christmas to his family after weeks of gruelling rehearsals.

Describing Strictly as ‘the hardest thing I have ever done’, he added: ‘I feel like I have aged. I would love to see a photograph of me day one and a photograph of me now.’
