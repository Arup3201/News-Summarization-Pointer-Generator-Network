Scandinavia is the world's most well-travelled region, according to a new study, with Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway all in the top five countries.

The average Finn takes 7.5 trips a year, topping the list compiled by Trimetic. The United States, coming in second, is the only non-Nordic country in the top five, with Americans travelling an average of 6.7 times per year.

Finland and the US are followed by Sweden (average six trips per year), Denmark (5.3), and Norway (5.2).

Well-travelled: The Finns travel more than any other country in the world, according to a new study

The United Kingdom ranks behind Australia, Canada, France and Germany, coming 13th on the list. 

The average Briton takes 0.9 international trips and two domestic trips per year. 

The reasons for the Scandinavian enthusiasm for travel is due to a wealthier population and a wish to escape the harsh winter, according to Trimetic. 

Abroad: The average Finn takes 7.5 trips per year, followed by Sweden, Denmark, then Norway

Wealth and weather: Scandinavians travel more thanks to higher incomes, and a wish to escape the winter

'People in Scandinavia can afford more trips due to high incomes and relatively low unemployment rates,' says Arnie van Groesen, travel and tourism analyst at Timetic. 

'Cost of living is relatively expensive in Scandinavian countries, meaning that if they go abroad they’ll often get more value for money. 

The weather conditions make them attracted to less severe conditions in the southern part of the world, such as the Spanish beaches.'

One in six Scandinavian families also own holiday homes they regularly travel to, the study reports.

Norwegians take an average of two international trips per year, the highest number in Europe. 

Despite being the second best-travelled country in the world, most Americans do not travel internationally. The US dominated the domestic tourism market, and only one in five Americans travelled abroad in 2013, and less than half own a passport.

Domestic holidays: While the US placed second, only 1 in 5 Americans travelled abroad in 2013

Tourists: Hong Kong, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and France are in the top 10 most well-travelled countries

Trimetic has put this down to far less paid holiday time for American workers than for those in Europe, making extended vacations more difficult, and therefore shorter breaks to closer destinations attractive.

Hong Kong ties with New Zealand for sixth position on the list, with almost all of those trips international. Domestic travel in Hong Kong is non-existent, with the average resident taking 4.3 trips per year - 74 per cent of those to China. 

In collating the data, Trimetic used only overnight trips taken in 2013, with any mode of transport (air, land, water, rail) included.
