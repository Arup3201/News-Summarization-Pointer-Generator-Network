The age-old saying goes that men can't multi-task.

But a new father goes out of his way to prove the claim wrong in a new home video.

Nathan Chartrand, 23, from Lakeland, Florida, was filmed as he skilfully put on a pair of pants while holding his baby son Milo.

Footage shows him wearing a white T-shirt and black boxer shorts before he starts getting dressed hands-free. 

He starts out by stepping into the pant legs. 

Then, in a bid to wrangle the fabric over his calves and thighs, he performs a jig from side to side. As he does a few 'magic' twists and turns the pants slowly start riding up.

He's got moves: Nathan Chartrand, 23, from Lakeland, Florida, was filmed as he skilfully put on a pair of pants while holding his baby son Milo 

Twist to the right, twist to the left: Footage shows him wearing a white T-shirt and black briefs before he starts getting dressed hands-free

At one point Chartrand gets down on two knees with his son remaining quiet throughout. 

As he nears the end of the stunt, the IT worker lets out a few jubilant cries of joy. 

'We did it,' he states as the clock stops at one-minute-35-second mark. 

His wife Sarah, who captured the feat on camera, can be heard laughing in the background. 

Adding in the humor is the rousing soundtrack; Europe's The Final Countdown. 

Chartrand became a first-time father in December and from the looks of his new video, he's settling into the role well.

Lost in the moment: In a bid to wrangle the fabric over his calves and thighs, he performs a jig from side to side

Almost there: As he performs a few 'magic' twists and turns the pants slowly start riding up 

Mission complete: 'We did it,' he states as the clock stops at one-minute-35-second mark - baby Milo remains quiet
