The body of a 32-year-old man has been found stuffed in a garbage bag and buried in a shallow grave, police said today.

Quinton Ross, 32, who was believed to have money problems, was found dead in a desolate area of Far Rockaway beach on Monday morning in Queens, New York.

Ross was reported missing to police in Queens by his family on Thursday after a relative 'saw men chasing him'.

The NYPD found the missing man's body by tracking his cellphone and identified him by his clothing.

The trashbag was stuffed in a weeded area between the boardwalk and the beach.

Authorities are investigating for signs of foul play and awaiting the results of an autopsy by the Medical Examiner's Office.

It is not known if the body suffered any trauma at this point.

Mr Ross's devastated aunt told the New York Post: 'People have been calling for Quinton asking about a car or getting some money, but I tell them he doesnâ€™t live here.

'Why did they bury him? What could he have done? Those b*******.'
