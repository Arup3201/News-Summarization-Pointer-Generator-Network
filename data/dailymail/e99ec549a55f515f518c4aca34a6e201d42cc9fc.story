Abuse of power: Los Angeles English teacher Joe Koetters (pictured in the above yearbook photo from Marlborough School) has been accused of starting several inappropriate relationships with female students

Pictured for the first time is the teacher at the center of a Los Angeles private school sex scandal, in yearbook photos exclusively obtained by MailOnline.

The Polytechnic School issued a statement on Sunday, saying English teacher Joe Koetters, 46, is no longer employed there following fresh allegations he sexually harassed multiple female students.

Koetters came under fire last month when former student Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie (now a rising sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania) published an essay on xoJane about the inappropriate relationship he instigated three years ago.

That personal account triggered several more former students to come forward and tell Buzzfeed their own experiences with Koetters, which ranged from sexual comments to sexually-charged emails and even touching.Â 

Koetters taught English at the $35,000-a-year Marlborough School for 14 years, before leaving last year to teach at his alma-mater Polytechnic School.

Amid the new allegations, Koetters has quit his job and now both schools are re-investigating the claims of sexual harassment.

Gilbert-Lurie says Koetters crossed the student-teacher boundary when she was a 16-year-old junior, and asked to interview him for the school newspaper.

He agreed, replying 'It's a date' to her email.

When they met up later outside the school, she wrote that he dodged her questions and turned the conversation towards romantic poetry, saying he could lend her a favorite book of his. At the end of the conversation, his hands brushed against her knee.

While Gilbert-Lurie said the flirting made her feel good at first, she became less comfortable with their relationship when he started getting more explicit in their email conversations.

Allegations: Several former students are now accusing Koetters of making inappropriate comments, sending sexually-charged emails and even going so far as to touch them

He said he knew how to draw a boundary with other students but not with her and talked about how her short uniform skirt made her 'so alluring'.

So a few day later, Gilbert-Lurie wrote him saying they needed to stop so she could focus on finals and 'just being 16'.

Koetters responded 'Ugh, Ok,' but continued to harass her in class and through email.

That's when she decided to tell her parents.

When Gilbert-Lurie and her parents went to the school to inform them about Koetters inappropriate behavior, the administration began an investigation.

Koetters was sent to sexual harassment training and stripped of his position as chair of the English department, but was not fired because it was a 'first-time offense'.

But Buzzfeed discovered at least two complaints formally lodged against Koetters, not to mention all of the former students who contacted Gilbert-Lurie with similar stories after she published her essay

In 2005, a student lodged a complaint against Koetters but the administration found that the claims were unsubstantiated. Koetters received a second complaint in 2012, from a 2011 grad who accused him of bullying her about her writing.

After publishing her essay, Gilbert-Lurie was contacted by several other former Marlborough students who had a similar relationship with Koetters but were too afraid to report his behavior to the administration.

Most of these former students agreed to talk to Buzzfeed about their encounters with Koetters.

One former student, identified as Mariah, says Koetters once told her: 'I love you in ways that are totally inappropriate for a teacher to love a student.'

She also recalled the time they were discussing the book Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee, which is about an inappropriate relationship between an English professor and a student.

Mariah talked about how she wanted to write an essay on the book, focusing on predators and prey.

Stomping ground: Koetters taught at $35,000-a-year Marlborough School for 14 years. Several former students are now coming out to say that he sexually harassed them

Out of the job: Koetters left Marlborough School in 2013 to start teaching at Polytechnic School, his alma mater. In a statement issued Sunday, the school says he is no longer employed

That's when Koetters told her, 'Just because someone is in a position of power over someone else doesn't mean the relationship can't be mutual.'

Crossing the line: University of Pennsylvania student Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie has written an essay detailing the inappropriate relationship her high school teacher Joe Koetters instigated

'He told me that if we had sex, it could be mutual, it could me love,' Mariah recalls.

She says he then put his hand on her knee.

Another 2012 graduate recalled how Koetters would use his power over female students to turn friends against each other. A former student identified as Stephanie says he turned their innocent conversations about help with class into a venting session where he would complain about his wife and kids.

Stephanie says she felt like an adult when he talked to her about his problems, but knows how wrong it was in retrospect.

'Now that I'm close to my thirties, I realize how wrong the situation was and regret not speaking out,' she said.

Koetters left Marlborough in 2013 to teach at another elite institution, Polytechnic School.

Marlborough has released a statement saying they are re-investigating Koetters, but were not informed about the other claims from former students. Polytechnic says it did not know about the allegations, but Gilbert-Lurie's mother says she called them before Koetters was hired.

On Sunday, Polytechnic issued a statement saying Koetters no longer works there and that they 'considered a range of information and perspectives' during the hiring process.

Malborough School officials say they were never informed that Koetters touched Gilbert-Lurie's knee, a claim she refutes. The school has since notified the Los Angeles Police Department Child Protective Students about the allegations, and hired former US Attorney Debra Wong Yang to conduct an investigation.

Dear Marlborough parents, alumnae, and friends,

We are writing to inform you about some difficult and deeply troubling information.

On June 30, 2014, a Marlborough graduate posted an online essay detailing her account of a former teacher's inappropriate communications and behavior, which occurred during the 2011-2012 school year. The School, consistent with its long-standing policies and protocols, promptly investigated and responded to the student's concerns. The essay, however, added details not previously reported to the School. We sincerely regret the suffering our alumna expressed through her essay.

Last week, another graduate came forward alleging an inappropriate physical relationship with the same teacher more than a decade ago. In response to this shocking and heart-breaking report, we immediately notified both the Los Angeles Police Department and Child Protective Services.

At Marlborough, we hold ourselves to the highest academic and personal standards, and there is no priority greater than the safety and well being of our students.

Our commitment to transparency and a full understanding of what occurred compels us to seek the truth. To that end, the Board of Trustees on Friday authorized an independent investigation of this matter and appointed a special investigative committee. This committee will be chaired by Trustee Debra Wong Yang, a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, and a nationally recognized expert in the field of internal investigations. Under Ms. Wong Yang's leadership, the committee will appoint a neutral investigator.

If you have any information that may be helpful to the investigation, or if your daughters are aware of any inappropriate conduct, we encourage you to contact us. We will maintain confidentiality to the extent legally permissible. Please contact Head of School Barbara Wagner at [redacted], or Trustee Debra Wong Yang at [redacted].

Marlborough is committed to keeping you fully informed of developments and the steps the School is taking to address this matter. As it becomes available, additional information will be provided on Marlborough's website. You also should know that we anticipate the media will report on this matter in the coming days.

We want to thank you in advance for your support. As a community, we can and will work through this challenging period with decisiveness, dignity, and a determination to never let this happen again.

Sincerely,

Christine C. Ewell, President, Board of Trustees

Barbara E. Wagner, Head of School
