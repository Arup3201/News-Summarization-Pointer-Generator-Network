Louis van Gaal has insisted the main priority for Manchester United this season must be to qualify for the Champions League despite Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal offering their best chance of a trophy this season.

Van Gaal is under strict orders from his bosses to restore United to European football's elite after last season's seventh-place finish under David Moyes saw them miss out.

United haven't won the FA Cup since 2004 and landed any silverware since Sir Alex Ferugson left but the Dutchman says the competition must still be treated as a welcome bonus rather than the primary objective of the campaign.

'I always want to get the goals what we have set. And the goals we have set is the top four,' said van Gaal.

'A title is fantastic. When you win the FA Cup you are not in the Champions League which is important for the club, but you have won a title. So for the players it is fantastic, for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the Champions League.'

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said that finishing in the top four was effectively winning a trophy and Van Gaal agrees.

'Yes, I think that he is right. I think that Arsene Wenger is saying always the right things. I think that for a club the Champions League is the highest level and that's why he is saying that.

'To finish in the first four is a fantastic result, I think. And for us, Manchester United, more I think.'

Van Gaal is still expected to put a strong team out against Arsenal. Wayne Rooney in particular wants to add the only major club medal missing from his cv.

The United boss, who has had to endure heavy criticism for the team's style of play despite a run of only two defeats in 22 matches, believes the result of the cup tie could also have a pyschological effect on the run-in for the all-important top four.

'Every match you play has an influence in the next match. So we are in a 'rat race' in the Premier League and the club who wins the FA match has a very good feeling for the next matches,' he said.

'It could be damaging for the team that loses, but you can also react.'

Van Gaal has been tetchy mood in the build-up to Monday night's game, feeling he has been misrepresented over claims that he has the best team in the Premier League, lacks a 20-goal-a-season striker and has a bad relationship with assistant Ryan Giggs, who sat stony-faced when United scored their last-minute winner at Newcastle on Wednesday night.

Among the problems van Gaal has to face is the poor form of £60million record signing Angel di Maria who has been substituted early in United's last two games and the lack of goals from Falcao whose loan spell is unlikely to be renewed at the end of the season without a dramatic change in fortunes.

The crowd reaction to the United manager on Monday will be interesting to see. So far, he has received little warmth from the fans whose cries of 'Attack, attack, attack' are a sign of frustration against van Gaal's possession-based game.

One piece of good news is that Michael Carrick may be able to start his first game since January 23 following a muscle rapture. United's best results this season have come when Carrick has played.
