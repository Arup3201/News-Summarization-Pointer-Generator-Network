A shamed solicitor who narrowly escaped jail after drink-driving has had a strict curfew relaxed so he can go sunbathing in the south of France.

Michael Passmore of Colchester, Essex, claimed he needed the sunshine break on the French Riviera in order to boost his bodyâ€™s vitamin D.

And, amazingly, a crown court has agreed to give Passmore the go ahead for his vacation.

Passmore, 58, was caught four times over the drink-drive limit in September last year.

He was stopped by police after drinking five drinks at a pub before getting behind the wheel of his car.

But he then fled the country to Sri Lanka before his court appearance.

He was arrested six months later upon his return where he was handed a 12-week suspended sentence for drink-driving along with a four-week suspended term for failing to attend court.

In August this year the former solicitor was placed on a strict curfew which was supposed to keep him at home every night.

But now a recorder at Chelmsford Crown Court has agreed to overturn the restrictions of the curfew.

Nneka Akuddlu, representing Passmore, said her client had a skin condition which would benefit from him spending time in the sunshine.

She said: 'Although doctors have told him they can prescribe creams, he has been told the best source of treatment would be vitamin D.

'He would like to visit a good friend in the south of France so that the climate there can assist with his condition.'

Miss Akuddlu told the court the condition was known as lichen planus which causes itchy rashes on the skin.

Recorder Neil Graham QC, who heard the appeal at Chelmsford Crown Court, agreed to relax the curfew so that Passmore could head abroad.

However, he restricted the relaxation of the curfew to seven days.

The court heard that Passmore also wanted to visit his sister, who is suffering from cancer, in Easbourne.

Miss Akuddlu said her client had imposed a driving ban upon himself since fleeing the country.
