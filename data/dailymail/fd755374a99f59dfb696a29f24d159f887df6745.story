West Ham youngsters Reece Oxford and Joe Powell have signed new contracts and will be presented on the Upton Park pitch on Tuesday night.

The pair will be shown off to Hammers supporters before the FA Cup third round replay against Everton.

Oxford, who turned 16 last month, had been drawing interest from Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal had all shown a major interest in the teenager in recent months.

But the young defender has agreed a new contract with the Hammers that will end any uncertainty over his future.

Discussions had originally stalled, but it is understood a breakthrough has now been made that will see Oxford, who has captained England Under 17s, put pen to paper.

Oxford - who was 15 at the time - was an unused substitute in the Capital One Cup defeat against Sheffield United in September - a clear indication of how highly regarded he is by West Ham staff.

The central defender, who has been likened to former Hammers academy graduate Rio Ferdinand, could have left for a nominal fee in the summer when his contract was due to expire.
