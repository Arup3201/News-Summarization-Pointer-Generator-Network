Another, Robert Hilton, said: ‘Everyone out on the street, car alarms going off and dogs barking.’

The British Geological Survey recorded the earthquake being centred a mile underground of the cathedral city.

One resident called the organisation to say the earthquake sounded like a bus crashing ‘into the neighbours house at speed’, while another said: 'The whole bed was visibly shaking'. 

A third resident told the BGS: 'At least five other households ran outside to make sense of what had shook the houses.'

Earthquake data in July last year showed an increasing number of quakes in the UK.

One hundred were recorded in the first three months of last year and 149 up to July, compared to 154 throughout 2013.
