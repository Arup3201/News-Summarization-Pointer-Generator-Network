In yet another jab to NBC's Olympics coverage, the network has been accused of manufacturing unnecessary suspense for the women's gymnastics final - which was arguably not even close.

The U.S. dominated the Russian team, which includes 2011 world champion Ksenia Afanaseva, and Team USA cruised to its first gold medal since 1996 by a five-point margin.

It wasn’t exactly as tight a match as TV viewers were led to believe. In fact, it was practically a runaway for the U.S. over a Russian team that struggled throughout the final.

What the network did not show was 
Afanaseva's floor exercise, complete with a cringe-worthy stumble that demolished any hope of Russia taking home gold.

The botched landing during Afanaseva's floor exercise sparked cries of despair among her teammates and and led the squad to walk away in tears.

As Deadspin.com’s Timothy Burke explained: 'NBC also cleverly avoided showing the standings upon skipping ahead to the U.S. rotation, with [commentator] Al Trautwig asking whether the U.S. "can deliver a knockout blow" and casting doubt upon American chances by showing Aly Raisman missing a tumble landing during warmups.'

Deadspin’s story included a BBC video that showed the Afanaseva's full performance.

Russia's woes began on the  balance 
beam, as Aliya Mustafina swayed and wobbled during her performance and 
Viktoria Komova almost stepped on the judges on her dismount.

'We did everything we could,' Komova said.

With the U.S. leading before the floor 
exercise - the final event - Russia needed two things to happen: A) The 
U.S. needed to make mistakes and B) Russia had to be flawless.

Unfortunately for Russia, the opposite occurred. 

The U.S., led by team captain Raisman was at her best on the floor, graceful in her tumbles and sticking the final landing.

On the Russian side, the team was 
marred by a stumble by Anastasia Grishina on the floor before 2011 World
 champion Afanaseva topped a near-flawless performance by landing the 
dismount on her knees.

The fall was the final mishap that 
destroyed Russia's hopes for gold, as the U.S. finished five points 
ahead of them, an astonishing victory by U.S. gymnasts McKayla Maroney, 
Jordyn Wieber, Gabrielle Douglas, Kyla Ross, and Miss Raisman.

Romania took the bronze.

While some teenagers might have found the pressure tough to bear on the world stage, the Americans revelled in it.

'We knew we could do it. We just had to pull out all the stops,' said Miss Raisman.

Their achievement earned the 'Fab 
Five' their place in history, and even President Obama congratulated the
 five members of the U.S. women's gymnastics team on Wednesday on their 
Olympic victory - and he had some questions about just how they managed 
to pull off their gold medal performances.

'I told these young ladies as I was 
congratulating them, how do you not bust your head every time you're on 
that little balance beam?' Obama said. 'I couldn't walk across that 
balance beam.'

Obama telephoned the gymnastics team from Air Force One as he traveled from Washington to Ohio for campaign events.

The president’s official Twitter 
account also posted a message to the girls, saying: 'Congratulations! 
You’ve made us all proud. #TeamUSA'.

Showing their excitement, each of the
 girls re-tweeted Obama's message, and thanked other celeb for their 
kind wishes, including Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Kim Kardashian and 
Taylor Swift.

NBC's broadcast of the London games 
has come under intense scrutiny, which has been exacerbated due to 
Twitter, which viewers have used as a soap box to gripe about the 
coverage.

The microblogging site erupted in 
protests earlier this week following a promo that showed U.S. swimmer 
Missy Franklin with her gold medal - moments before the network aired 
the dramatic race in which she won it.

In a statement to MailOnline, NBC apologised for the mistake.

On Monday night, a Los Angeles-based reporter and vocal critic of the network had his Twitter page suspended.

Guy Adams, who writes for The Independent, lost his account after the network complained he tweeted the email address of NBC Olympics president Gary Zenkel so viewers could 'tell him what you think.'

Adams' account was later reinstated.

There was also outrage over NBC's decision to cut a tribute for the victims of the London 2005 terrorist bombings from its Olympics Opening Ceremony coverage on Friday.

The network said it did not air the tribute because it wasn't tailored for the U.S. audience - and aired a Ryan Seacrest interview with iconic swimmer Michael Phelps instead.
