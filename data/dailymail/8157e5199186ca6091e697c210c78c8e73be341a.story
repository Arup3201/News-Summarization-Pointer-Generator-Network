In Jane Austen's time, manners maketh the man and being able to hold a captive and witty conversation was a virtue.

So just what would the literary legend have made of today's society where the art of face-to-face communication is being lost to texting and Tweeting?

No doubt she may have been as irked as Alex Haigh, 23, from Melbourne, Australia, who has set up 'A Stop Phubbing' campaign group to shame people who snub friends and family they are with in favour of checking their mobile phone.

How rude! But many Brits have admitted they will talk on their phone during dinner and whilst in company

It's a social faux pas that a third of Britons polled admitted to in a recent survey, with more than a quarter (27 per cent) saying they would answer their phone in the middle of a face-to-face conversation.

A third confessed that they would answer the phone in a restaurant and 19 per cent said they would while being served in a shop.

Now Glamour magazine have imagined just how Austen would have satirised those in need of social etiquette when it comes to using their smartphone.

Or, to paraphrase the novelist, how it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man (or woman) in possession of a good smart phone must be in want of manners.

So here's 'what Jane would do' when it comes to using your mobile with good manners...

One does not approve: Jane Austen was a stickler for social etiquette

One must avoid reading emails at mealtimes/social occasions. It is Phubbing of the highest degree

Or, as Jane might say: 'To sit in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment. But it is lost if one is more engrossed in that email Rebecca sent you of a cat falling into a bathtub.'

One must not leave a missed call without an answerphone message or text

Or, as Jane might say: 'One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other. So how in Darcy's name do you expect us to know what you were calling about if there is but no intimation of your purpose?'

One must use Whatsapp with great care - instead of sharing every waking thought or decision with a group

Or, as Jane might say: 'You have delighted us long enough.'

One must not put non-verbal things on the phone - like a cat or newborn baby. Especially when you are calling them long distance. ('Hi Mr Snuffles. Our conversation is costing me 43p per minute')

Or, as Jane might say: 'My idea of good company is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company.'

One must always say goodbye when hanging up

Or as Jane might say: 'You hung up on me? Badly done, Emma!'
