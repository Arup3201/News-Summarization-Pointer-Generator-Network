A grandmother was killed and her husband left with brain damage after they were run over on a zebra crossing by a driver who was apparently dazzled by the winter sun.

An inquest heard how Lynn Steele, 60, and her 64-year-old husband Raymond, from Shaw, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, were walking hand-in-hand across the road when they were mown down by a Toyota Yaris after the driver failed to spot them.

The couple, who were on their way back home from booking a holiday at a travel agents, were taken to hospital where grandmother-of-two Mrs Steele died from multiple injuries, including a fractured skull.

Mr Steele was treated for multiple injuries in hospital for four weeks and has no recollection of the events. He lost sight in his left eye because a facial fracture severed his optical nerve and also has lasting brain injuries.

An inquest heard how motorists had complained of being temporarily blinded by a low lying and glaring sun at the time of the incident.

One witnesses said she was ‘frightened’ by the low-lying sun so had to slow down to a stop because visibility was so poor.

The unnamed 60-year-old driver of the Yaris could be seen at the wheel in the moments following the collision with her head in her hands.

She escaped the crash uninjured and was stopped at the scene and interviewed under caution but not arrested. She has since passed away from a terminal illness.

The couple’s daughter Sarah, who is 
blind, said her mother and father had moved in 2010 to their bungalow just metres from the accident spot.

She said that since receiving a double
hip replacement when she was 50, Lynn had enjoyed an active life with 
her husband, which included walking, swimming and cycling.

Sarah said of her father: ‘He can communicate but is always very angry due to the brain injuries. It’s changed his personality.

‘My mum and dad were very careful 
people and just because of my experience being with them when they were 
with me out and about crossing roads, I can’t understand how this 
happened. I find it unbelievable.’

Mr Steele was not able to attend the hearing for health reasons.

This is the crossing, on Milnrow Road in Shaw, Greater Manchester, where the couple were run over

The tragedy occurred on January 16 last year in the village of Shaw, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, at 3pm.

They were walking across the pedestrian crossing outside shops in the village only to be hit by the Toyota driver who apparently failed to spot them.

Witness Julie Sykes who was driving on Milnrow Road shortly before the 3pm crash told the hearing: ‘It was a clear day and dry with good visibility. However as I continued driving through town I noticed the sun was shining very brightly and was low in the sky.

‘I was driving directly into the sunlight and had to put the car’s visor down but it made no difference. Soon I couldn’t see anything. The sun was so bright and so low I found myself looking for the lines on the road. I slowed right down because it was frightened me. I just couldn’t see.

Susan Steele, daughter of Lynn and Raymond, said the couple lived in a bungalow minutes from the crossing

‘I had begun talking to myself, saying, “I hope no-one is on that crossing” because I wouldn’t have been able to see them. I stopped before the crossing because I couldn’t see if anyone was on it because I couldn’t see the crossing.

‘The sun was so low and was on the windscreen. Due to this I actually opened my driver’s side door and put a leg out to stand up and look at the crossing. There was nobody there and it was quiet.

‘When I was back in the car I was still barely able to see and almost missed the left turn and nearly hit a bollard.

‘I was very upset to hear about this but I wasn’t overly surprised. I haven’t experience anything as frightening as that day since.’

Another witness, newsagent Mohammad Iltaf, said: ‘I was looking out of the window and to my right I saw a blue Toyota Yaris doing about 30-35mph and was about 30ft from the crossing.

‘At the same time I noticed an old couple stop on the zebra crossing and they were facing away from me. They then went a couple of steps onto the crossing.

‘The blue Yaris wasn’t stopping and it hit the man and woman and they flew into the air then the car swerved. It came to a stop about 10ft past the crossing.

‘The woman who had been hit was a short distance behind the car. The man had been thrown forwards. I went to help the woman but I ran back to the shop and got a towel for the blood and when I came back a lot of people were around and traffic was backing up.

‘The incident happened in a matter of seconds. The only thing that would have stopped the driver would have been the sun. She would have been blinded by it.’

Motorist Jacqueline Helliwell said: ‘I saw out of the corner of my left eye a shadow fall to the floor. It came from the bonnet of a car.

‘I saw an old lady lying on her left hand side facing towards me and an old man with his back on the road and a stream of blood running towards the gutter.

‘In the stationary blue car there was a lady of about 60 with her head in her hands.’

The inquest at Heywood continues.
