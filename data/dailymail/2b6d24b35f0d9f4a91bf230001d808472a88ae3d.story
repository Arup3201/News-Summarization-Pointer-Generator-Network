Ryan Giggs is likely to be thrust back into his role as stand-in manager at Manchester United this week when the players return to training on Friday.

With United manager Louis van Gaal at the World Cup and with Holland expected to progress against Mexico through the second round, Giggs could effectively be in control for the next two weeks.

Van Gaalâ€™s new United assistants Marcel Bout and Frans Hoek, who is the goalkeeping coach, are part of his team with the Dutch FA, so it will be down to his remaining assistant Giggs to set the tone for the new season.

Stand in: Ryan Giggs will return to the managerial hotseat as Louis van Gaal's World Cup campaign continues

Adventure: Louis van Gaal is still with Holland at the World Cup

And though United will probably prefer Van Gaal to come into the job on the back of a successful World Cup, it will create problems regarding any tactical changes he wishes to make, given that he might only return shortly before United set off on their US tour in late July.

Nicky Butt, who will remain as Under-21 coach, will assist Giggs but it is unclear whether Paul Scholes and Phil Neville will be involved.

Scholes is likely to take an ambassadorial role and, while the club want to keep Neville in a coaching capacity, he will only stay if there is a clear role for him.
