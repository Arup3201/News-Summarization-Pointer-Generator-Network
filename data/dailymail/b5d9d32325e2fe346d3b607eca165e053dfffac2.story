David Beckham could captain his country one more time against Germany to commemorate the centenary of the 1914 Christmas Day truce.

The retired footballer is to be approached by the Government to mark the day British and Germans troops laid down their weapons and played football on No Man's Land.

The Government wants Beckham, who acted as an ambassador for the 2012 Olympics and 2018 World Cup bids, to lead a team of British players and serving soldiers in a football match against the Germans on Boxing Day 2014.

Patriotic: David Beckham has made no secret of the pride he takes in representing his country

The game would be shown live on television as a way to capture the interest of the public in the centenary of the start of the First World War.

Sir Bobby Charlton and Franz Beckenbauer, who faced each other in the 1966 World Cup Final, may also be among the football legends invited to join the event, reports the Sunday Times.

The Christmas Day truce saw more 
than 100,000 British and German soldiers lower their guns and leave the 
trenches in the mud of No Man's Land.

In some areas, soldiers on both sides merely held their fire throughout the day.

But elsewhere, troops climbed out of their trenches and exchanging gifts and handshakes and 
playing football.

The match finished 3-2 to the Germans, according to the diaries of Kurt Zehmisch, a soldier in the 134th Saxons.

More practically, soldiers used the time to reclaim their dead from no man's land and bury them behind the lines.

In
the evening, soldiers of both sides sang carols and fighting 
only resumed when fresh battalions were moved into the line.

The football match, to be held at Messines, near Ypres in Belgium, is among ideas to be considered by the First World War advisory group, chaired by Culture Secretary Maria Miller.

Footballs have previously been placed at the site next to the wooden cross that commemorates the truce.

Defence
Minister Andrew Murrison said in February that a football match was 'a 
no-brainer in terms of an event that is going to reach part of the 
community that perhaps might not get terribly entrenched into this'.

Speaking
to The Guardian, Dr Murrison said: 'It had no real relevance to the 
outcome of the war but at that deeply, intensely, personal level, it is 
something that people really do latch on to.'
