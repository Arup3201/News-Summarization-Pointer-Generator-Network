Leonardo DiCaprio's missing niece was today found by the authorities after she was 'abducted' by her family after her father was arrested on drug-related charges in Texas.

Authorities had desperately been trying to find Normadie
 Farrar, six, who was last seen on Saturday last week.

Her father Adam Farrar, who is DiCaprio's oldest sibling, has been accused of concealing the missing child, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.

Farrar's girlfriend Charity Moore, 
38, was also arrested nearly a week before him on a slew of charges, 
including two counts of possession of a dangerous drug, theft and a 
misdemeanor involving a parent contributing to the child's failure to 
attend school, according to her Collin County Jail arrest record.

The pair had been hiding in Texas with the little girl away from the reach of the LA County Department of Children and Family Service, who have long been involved in their case because of their criminal pasts.

But today a spokesman for the department told RadarOnline: 'I am happy to confirm that this child has in fact been found. It's great news. Beyond that, I can't really say more'.

In an interview with MailOnline yesterday, Rachell Costin, a younger sister of Charity, had said the family knew where the girl was, but refused to reveal her whereabouts.

Asked if the Normadie was with a relative, Rachell, 28, from Garland, Texas, said: 'I can't tell anyone that information, I wish I could, but I definitely want to let you know she is safe, so that way you don't report maybe she's still missing and report wrong information.

Rachell, who has an eight-month-old son herself, claimed her sister was a good mom.

She said: 'Charity loves her daughter so much. I can tell you that, I can tell you that Charity does love her daughter a lot and she definitely would never want her to be in an unsafe place or anything. I'm sure she does (know Normadie is in a safe place), I haven't talked to her though about that.'

Asked about the drug allegations against her sister, Rachell said: 'I know nothing about Charity and her alleged drug use, I know nothing about that.

'I don't want to even comment on the drug use, I've just known her to be the same Charity my whole life, I don't want to say whether yes or no. She really loves, her daughter, She's a good mum to her daughter.'

She added that as far as she was aware Normadie was not subject to a missing person search.

Rachell said: 'As far as I know, police here are not and police in LA shouldn't be either. I guess when they first got arrested maybe they were then, but I can let you know now she's safe. It's nobody else's business about what's going on with her.'

Trouble with the law: Farrar's girlfriend Charity Moore was also arrested nearly a week before him on a number of charges. Both were said to have been hiding out in Texas beyond the reach of LA social workers

Lengthy:
 Her charges include two counts of possession of a dangerous drug, theft
 and a misdemeanor involving a parent contributing to the child's 
failure to attend school'

Farrar was reportedly detained in Collin 
County Friday on 'two Class A Misdemeanors...for possession of a 
dangerous drug and theft'.

According
 to the website, both charges were outstanding warrants issued in Los 
Angeles. He was also reportedly charged with phone harassment.

If convicted, the 43-year-old faces a lengthy prison sentence.

DiCaprio and Farrar used to be close and 
the pair were seen attending Los Angeles Lakers games together and hitting 
the Hollywood party scene – although in recent years it’s thought their 
relationship has turned sour. 

Sources told RadarOnline that Farrar 
and his Oscar nominee step-brother 'have had zero contact in recent 
years and do not get along.'

It
 is widely reported that DiCaprio was inspired to go into acting after 
he saw his step-brother carve a career for himself in commercials, 
movies and TV in the 1980s.

Farrar is best known for his roles in the science fiction series Battlestar Galactica and the ABC comedy-drama Eight is Enough.

However,
 as DiCaprio's career took off in the late 90s and Farrar's came to a standstill, things
 ended up rather differently for the brothers, who grew up together in 
LA after DiCaprio's mother, Peggy, married Farrar's father, cartoonist George DiCaprio, when he was 
just one.

Since
 2010, Farrar has been in and out of courts on charges of harassment, 
possession of controlled substances, driving without a license and 
domestic violence. 

In 2000, as DiCaprio was riding the 
success of his blockbuster Titanic, Farrar was arrested on charges that 
he attempted to kill his then-girlfriend and made terroristic threats.

At the time, Peggy DiCaprio said of her troubled stepson: 'Adam is one of the most nonviolent people I know,’ according to New York Daily News.

Farrar was released within 48 hours of his March 2000 arrest, and the charges against him were eventually dropped.

People Magazine
 reported that two years earlier, the struggling actor landed in trouble
 with the law after allegedly assaulting a photographer who was pursuing
 his superstar sibling. Charges were never filed in that case.
