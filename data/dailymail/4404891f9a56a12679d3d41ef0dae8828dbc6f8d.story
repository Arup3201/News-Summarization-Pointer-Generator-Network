Rupert Murdoch and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held a secret meeting at Chequers ahead of the media tycoon's takeover of Times newspapers, it has been revealed.

Mr Murdoch personally lobbied the PM over Sunday lunch on January 4, 1981, Mrs Thatcher's files show.

Neither party has ever admitted that such a meeting took place, but details of the meeting have now been uncovered in a note written by Mrs Thatcher’s press secretary Bernard Ingham and marked 'Commercial - In Confidence'.

The files reveal that Mr Murdoch requested the chat, which came three weeks before the first cabinet committee discussion of his takeover.

The Australian sent a handwritten thank-you note to 'My dear Prime Minister' two weeks later, telling her that 'the field has contracted down to only two or three of us' and that Times owners the Thomson family would 'make up their minds in the next day or so'.

Mr Murdoch was confirmed as owner of The Times and Sunday Times in February 1981.

At no point did Mrs Thatcher publicise the meeting, and she also instructed that the note on the lunch should not leave No 10 Downing Street.

The impression given in the newspaper's official history is that Mr Murdoch had had no contact with the prime minister ahead of the Government's approval of his purchase.

Mr Ingham's note shows that the media boss tried to bond with the Conservative prime minister by praising Ronald Reagan's new administration.

He then explicitly briefed her on his bid and plans for Times Newspapers, including taking on the unions, introducing new technology and reducing the workforce by 25 per cent.

He outlined his intention to make the operation profitable by introducing technology and lowering manning levels.

But records show there was no discussion of whether a bid would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

The government had the power to block the takeover by such a referral because Mr Murdoch already owned The Sun and the News of the World.

The deal was apparently not referred to the MMC because ministers feared the newspapers could close if not sold quickly.

Trade secretary John Biffen made the decision - but recently released minutes from the economic strategy 
committee meeting on 26 January show that the PM spoke to highlight the exemption under the 
Fair Trading Act 1973 that would allow Mr Murdoch's bid to avoid a 
referral.

The newspaper group went on to become the biggest in Britain.

News Corporation even came close to taking full control of 
BSkyB 30 years later, but the deal collapsed in furore that 
followed the revelation that murder victim Milly Dowler's phone had been hacked by 
the News of the World.

David Cameron's first meeting with a media owner was with Mr Murdoch in July 2010, two months after he became prime minister.

The businessman entered No 10 by the back door and the meeting was not initially disclosed when Cameron first published a list of meetings with media owners and newspaper editors in July last year.

The Thatcher papers have been released by the Churchill archives centre, Cambridge, after 30 years.

It contradicts the account in the official history of The Times that says Mrs Thatcher and Mr Murdoch 'had no communication whatsoever during the period in which the Times bid and referral was up for discussion'.

It suggests the tycoon relied on the columnist Woodrow Wyatt to plead his case.

Mr Ingham's note on the lunch says the newspaper owner offered to arrange a meeting for the PM with a group of 'New Right' politicians on her upcoming visit to New York.

He also dismissed rival bidders, including Robert Maxwell, as unlikely to impress either Mr Thomson, unions or journalists.

Mr Murdoch added that he was risking £50m of News Group's resources in the deal and that such an amount 'could finish us'.

Mr Ingham writes that Mrs Thatcher did nothing more than 'wish him well in his bid' as well as noting the need to improve Fleet Street staffing levels and  introduce new technology.

The later cabinet committee minutes confirm Mrs Thatcher's role in the discussion but also that the trade department's accountants had advised that The Times was not economic as a going concern.

Many people who wanted the MMC to block Murdoch's takeover believed that the Sunday Times would return to financial health.
