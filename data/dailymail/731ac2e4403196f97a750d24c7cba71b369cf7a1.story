Mugged outside her own home: Carole Mudie, 68

A grandmother who 'lived for her family' has died a fortnight after being mugged as she got out of her car in front of her house.

Carole Mudie, 68, had her bag snatched and was pushed into a hedge in her garden as she returned home from a night playing bingo with friends on January 6.

She underwent surgery for a broken hip but developed complications, and died on January 22.

Today West Midlands police hunting for her attacker said they had now launched a manslaughter investigation after the incident in Hawkesley, Birmingham.

Mrs Mudie's devastated daughter Carey Healey, 43, said: 'Our world has been blown apart and we can't believe that she has gone.'

'Mum was bubbly, happy and had a great sense of humour.

'She lived for us and the children; she was selfless like that and she had so many friends.

'The whole family is devastated that she has been taken from us in this way.'

Mrs Mudie was returning from a night out at 11.10pm and had got out of her lime green Ford Focus when she was attacked in front of the home she had lived in for 30 years.

Neighbours found her collapsed in a privet hedge in her front garden and she was taken by ambulance to Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth II hospital.

Detective Sergeant Andy Bradley, from the force's Criminal Investigation Department, said: 'We now really need the public's help as we progress this inquiry, following the tragic turn of events.

'A man is currently in custody on remand having been charged with separate matters and has been spoken to in relation to this offence.

'But what we desperately need is for anyone who witnessed the robbery of Carole Mudie to come forward.

'I'm keen to hear from anyone who saw 
what happened or who may have witnessed the offender fleeing the scene 
following the crime.

Home for 30 years: Grandmother Mrs Mudie was attacked outside her house in Hawkmoor Gardens

'Regardless of how irrelevant you think it may be, the smallest piece of information could be all we need to be able to get justice for Mrs Mudie.'

Neighbours of Mrs Mudie, who lived on her own on the Hawkmoor Gardens estate, spoke of their shock at what happened to the well-known grandmother.

Janet Oxley, 52, said: 'Just as I was getting back from walking my dogs two of the lads who live next door were helping Carole up off the ground and back in to her house.

'She looked in a bad way but I asked if they needed help and they said everything was OK.

'That was the last time I saw her.'

Neighbour Jessica Sellars, 59, said: 'She was a wonderful woman with a big personality.

'She wouldn't have given up without a fight but she was obviously no match for a big burly bloke.

'It is a close-knit area but there have been problems with crime. You don't feel safe leaving your own home.

'But what has this world come to when you're attacked on your own front doorstep?'

Another neighbour, Janet Murphy, 67, added: 'I don't leave the house after dark anymore after this happened. It's such a tragedy.'

A post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and officers are awaiting further test results to confirm the exact cause of death.  They are also trying to establish whether Mrs Mudie was the victim of a targeted attack or opportunists.

Anyone with information is urged to contact Force CID on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
