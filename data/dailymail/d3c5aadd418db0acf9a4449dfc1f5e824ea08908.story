Internet companies are refusing to pass on potentially critical information to GCHQ and improved their privacy settings following the Edward Snowden scandal which has allowed criminals to evade detection  

Internet companies are refusing to pass on potentially critical evidence to GCHQ on serious criminals such as drug dealers and paedophiles because they do not meet their criteria for causing enough harm.

By improving encryption on their services, the companies, which include telecoms firms and social media companies, are also indirectly helping criminals evade detection. 

The improvements were made following the Edward Snowden leaks on GCHQ tactics.

The revelations, revealed by The Daily Telegraph, come as internet companies are also facing criticism for not doing enough to stop terrorists and fanatics from spreading extremism. 

Robert Hannigan, the new director of GCHQ, warned in November that some internet services were 'the command and control networks of choice' for terrorists and criminals. He said those companies were in 'denial'. 

Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, backed those claims and called for technology firms to do more to help protect the public from criminals. 

Facebook was criticised for failing to pass on information about Michael Adebowale, who went on to kill Fusilier Lee Rigby along with his co-offender Michael Adebokajo.

Five months before the 2013 murder, Adebowale had expressed his intent to murder a soldier in the 'most graphic and emotive manner'.  

Facebook was unaware of the comments, but had previously closed Adebowale's accounts for discussing terrorism, something it has not informed security services of.

GCHQ works with the National Crime Agency to target the most serious criminal bosses and gangs. 

But a senior security source told the newspaper that providers have a threshold for releasing information on their users and only do so if there is a direct threat to life.

Internet companies have a threshold for releasing information on their users and only do so if there is a direct threat to life; many criminals the GCHQ track cause significant damage to communities but don't pose a direct threat to life, so their private information remains a secret

The problem arises because, unlike terror suspects, many criminals GCHQ tracks, cause significant harm in the community, rather than posing a direct threat to life. 

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said internet companies needed to 'cooperate fully' to ensure that criminals were prosecuted.

After Snowden stole tens of thousands of files from the US National Security Agency, internet companies improved their privacy settings, which authorities claim criminals and now exploiting.
