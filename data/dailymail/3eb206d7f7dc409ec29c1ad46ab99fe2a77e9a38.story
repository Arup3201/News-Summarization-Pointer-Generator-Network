David Warner has been fined £7,000 and suspended by Cricket Australia after throwing a punch at England's Joe Root on Saturday night.

The Aussie opener was summoned before CA's code of behaviour commissioner via teleconference on Thursday morning and his punishment was announced less than two hours later after he pleaded guilty to 'unbecoming behaviour'.

The suspension rules Warner out of the 
rest of the Champions Trophy and Australia's Ashes warm-up games ahead 
of the start of the first Test at Trent Bridge on July 10.

A statement read: 'Cricket Australia (CA) advises that David Warner has been suspended and fined for breaching the Cricket Australia Code of Behaviour.

'At a hearing tonight, Warner pleaded guilty to breaching Rule 6: Unbecoming Behaviour.

'CA Senior Code of Behaviour Commissioner, The Hon. Justice Gordon Lewis AM, fined Warner $11,500 (£7,000) and suspended him from the remainder of Australia’s ICC Champions Trophy campaign as well as the Australian team’s two tour matches before the first Ashes Test against Somerset and Worcestershire.

'Warner will be eligible for selection for the first Test.

'Rule 6 states: Without limiting any 
other rule, players and officials must not at any time engage in 
behaviour unbecoming to a representative player or official that could 
(a) bring them or the game of game into disrepute or (b) be harmful to 
the interests of cricket.'

Warner was seen leaving the 
Australian team hotel on Thursday with the rest of the squad but he will
play no further part in their Champions Trophy campaign.

Venue: The Walkabout on Broad Street in Birmingham

Late night option: Questions have to be asked as to why Root and Co were at Walkabout in the first place

Australia take on Sri Lanka at The Kia 
Oval on Monday and need a win to stand any chance of qualifying for the 
semi-final after their 48-run loss to England at Edgbaston.

Warner was axed from the squad for 
Wednesday's washed-out game against New Zealand which has left the 
Aussies staring at an early exit from the competition.

The 26-year-old will also miss 
Australia's four-day Ashes warm-up games against Somerset on June 26 and
Worcestershire on July 2, putting his Test place in serious jeopardy.

Unless Warner can gain some county 
experience in the four weeks betwen now and the start of the five-match 
series against England it appears likely veteran Chris Rogers will be 
asked to step in and open the batting for Australia alongside Ed Cowan.
