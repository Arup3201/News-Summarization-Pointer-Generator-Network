The M4 motorway has reopened in both directions a week after it was closed for emergency repair works but questions have been raised if the job was rushed to prevent national humiliation.

The road, which is expected to be one of the busiest routes during the Olympic Games, was shut last Friday between junctions 2 and 3 after cracks were discovered on a viaduct.

It was reopened to traffic - but only to cars and lorries under 7.5 tonnes - at around 5.30am after engineers completed the 'complex' repairs which were due to be fixed yesterday.

It prompted Labour to question if safety corners were cut and the job rushed to prevent embarrassment ahead of the arrival of Olympic athletes and their families on Monday.

Good news: The M4 motorway has reopened in both directions a week after it was closed for emergency repair works, the Highways Agency said this morning

Labour shadow transport spokesman John Woodcock described the reopening of the M4 as a 'huge relief', but said ministers needed to come out and confirm they were totally happy that the road was safe to use.

He said: ’Given the scale of the problem, ministers need to come out and say they are completely confident the crack is fixed.’He told BBC Breakfast: 'The whole country wants the Olympics to be a huge success so it is a huge relief that the road is open because of the chaos it would have caused with athletes arriving on Monday to travel to the Olympic Village.’

The shadow transport minister added: 'There are real questions as to why this crack was found so late in the day as works have been going on there for some time.'The Highways Agency hinted that an exception to the weight rule may be made for Olympic coaches transporting Olympic VIPs and athletes to and from Heathrow  preparations for the games get underway.A spokesman added: "The crack was discovered during an ongoing repair programme. Work on that continues and for this reason vehicles weighing 7.5 tonnes or more will still be restricted from using the motorway between the junctions.

A diversion route remains in place via the A4 and A312 dual carriageways.'

But Roads Minister Mike Penning blasted Labour and other critics for ‘scaremongering’ over suggestions that engineers might have been bounced off by the Government into re-opening the M4 when it wasn’t totally safe to do so, saying those who spread such tales should be ‘ashamed’ of themselves.Speaking at the worksite on the M4, Mr Penning assured motorists the bridge was safe stressing: ‘Don't be scared. Scaremongers will be scaring you. Structural engineers have specifically done all the work. No structural engineer in this country is going to say "Minister, you can open that bridge" unless they are certain it is perfectly safe.

'Anyone saying it isn't safe is scaremongering and they should be ashamed of themselves.’He also denied political pressure had prompted the swift reopening of the motorway: ‘There was absolutely none at all, structural engineers don't work that way. You can say what you like to them but it's their reputation and their careers, their job is about safety.

‘Yes we have a commitment to have this open not only for the Olympics but for the people of London and this country because it's a major route in and out and of course I wanted it open but I said it would open when it was safe and this morning it was safe for seven and a half tonnes.’

He added: ‘I've just passed a message
from the Prime Minister to the hard working engineers to thank them for
what they have done 24/7 to get this motorway open.’

The hairline crack was found on a highly stressed section of bridge 
supports by engineers who had been carrying out other repairs on the 
busy section of road.

'The Highways Agency closed the motorway 
last Friday night because in entering the final stages of the repair 
work, a new crack was found in a highly stressed part of the bridge 
supports,' the spokesman continued.

'This required a unique repair solution involving the manufacturing bespoke specialist steel plates and their installation over the crack.

'The crack then had to be removed to prevent further damage to the structure. This intricate part of the operation took several hours - even though the crack was a hairline one.'

Summit: Transport Minister Justine Greening has held emergency talks today to try to solve the problems

The M4, which is the main route from London to Heathrow Airport and the West of England, was initially closed between junctions 1 and 3, causing misery for thousands of motorists.

It is expected to be one of the busiest routes during the Games because it links London and the Olympic Park in Stratford with Heathrow.

The motorway will officially become part of the Olympic Route Network on Monday, with one lane of each carriageway reserved for competitors, officials and sponsors.

Drivers have been warned the ORN will include temporary changes including suspended turns, stopping and loading restrictions and traffic signal alterations.

A perfect storm of Olympic transport chaos erupted as Downing Street sought to cope with the closure of the M4 and long queues at Heathrow.

The first Games visitors 
arriving at Heathrow’s Terminal Five faced two-hour immigration queues
as Border Force desks remained unmanned.

Before it reopened today, No 10 was drawing up 
contingency plans to deal with the M4 fiasco.

Downing Street had refused to rule out 
options such as opening up a single M4 lane for Olympic traffic – 
denying access to the motorway to all other motorists or hauliers – or 
even commandeering the Heathrow Express train for the sole use of 
Olympic VIPs to avoid putting stress on the stricken M4 bridge.

Another 
option looked at was to reopen the motorway to cars only – but turn
back all lorries and buses except for the Olympic coaches.

Cracks: White paint marks the cracks in the elevated section of the Boston Manor Viaduct flyover which need fixing before the Olympics starts. The cracks were first spotted four months ago

The Prime Minister was updated 
several times yesterday and sent Transport Secretary Justine Greening to
the scene amid concerns that the repair work is not proceeding quickly 
enough.

Determined: Roads minister Mike Penning had vowed the motorway would reopen on schedule

Crisis talks were also held with London Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy and London 2012 transport director Richard George.

Labour said David Cameron  was 
presiding over a ‘national embarrassment’ which meant ‘humiliation’ for 
Britain as London prepared to welcome the world to the Games.

But Miss Greening’s supporters said Labour was ‘deeply irresponsible’ and playing politics with people’s lives over road safety.

Adding to the Government’s woes, 
there was fury at Heathrow where passengers faced long queues as 
immigration desks remained empty.

The Home Office has promised to beef up staff numbers for the Olympics though they will not go ‘live’ until Sunday.

Airport operator BAA confirmed immigration queues of ‘around an hour-and-a-half’ – double the 45 minute target.

The Immigration Services Union said 
the combination of the first Olympic visitors with the start of the 
school holidays ‘meant things were expected to get bad’ and said not 
enough had been done to address the issue.

Lucy Noreton, deputy general 
secretary of the ISU, said drafting in contingency staff on Sunday was 
‘too little, too late’, adding: ‘Is this a national embarrassment – yes 
probably.’

The Prime Minister’s official 
spokesman said: ‘We are looking at various contingency plans to ensure 
athletes and the Games family arriving at Heathrow can get through 
easily.’
