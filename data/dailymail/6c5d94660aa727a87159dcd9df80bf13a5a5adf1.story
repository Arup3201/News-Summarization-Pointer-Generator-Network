Dozens of people are feared dead following an explosion in north-eastern Nigeria, with Boko Haram militants believed to be behind the attack.

The attack took place last night after a village football competition in the town of Mubi in Adamawa state.

It is one of the three states under a year-old emergency rule imposed by President Goodluck Jonathan to fight Boko Haram, which seeks to impose Islamic rule in Nigeria.

The attack took place last night near a primary school where there are also a number of beer halls in the town of Mubi in Adamawa state

Othman Abubakar, a spokesman for the Adamawa state police, confirmed the explosion but he could not say how many people had been killed or injured.

David Dauda, who witnessed the blast, said he saw at least 30 bodies following the explosion.

'The blast occurred shortly after people are dispersing from a football playing ground,' he said.

'People gathered there to watch a football competition and just few minutes after soldiers patrol vehicle left the place then we heard a blast.'

The explosion occurred at around 6.45pm local time when many people were headed home to make a 7.00pm curfew imposed in the wake of earlier attacks.

Nigeria's north-eastern region has suffered five years of increasingly deadly assaults by Boko Haram, whose fighters have targeted towns and villages in a string of bomb and gun attacks.

At least 2,000 civilians have been killed in such attacks this year alone.

Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for kidnapping more than 300 schoolgirls in the town of Chibok on April 15.

The 250 girls are being held by Islamic group Boko Haram after they were abducted from Chibok, in north eastern Nigeria

Fifty seven girls are believed to have escaped, which leaves an estimated 272 still held captive.

In another attack yesterday evening, also in Adamawa state, suspected Boko Haram members opened fire at people indiscriminately around the town of Madagali, according to witnesses.

Boko Haram terrorists took more than 250 girls in a raid on their school in Chibok, in Nigeria’s north-east, on April 14.

At the weekend a heartbreaking new video of the Nigerian schoolgirls shows them bravely speaking out about their ordeal for the 
first time.

The
 footage, not released publicly but seen by The Mail on Sunday, was 
taken in a jungle clearing a month after their abduction.

The video, taken by an intermediary on 
May 19, has been shown to President Goodluck Jonathan. It was intended 
to serve as ‘proof of life’ for the girls and to encourage the President
 to accede to the terrorists’ demands.

The Nigerian government has been engaged in negotiations with Boko Haram's spiritual leader Abubakar Shekau in a bid to secure the girls' release
