NBA superstar Kevin Durant called a former ESPN writer who criticized his club for extending a teammate's contract a 'dumbass' on Twitter.

The Oklahoma City Thunder signed forward Nick Collison to a two-year extension yesterday and basketball writer Chris Palmer ripped into the team after Durant, 26, offered up his congratulations. 

Durant, the reigning NBA MVP, dismissed Palmer's comment as if he was swatting away an opponent's shot on the court.

Collison, 34, is averaging 3.8 points, 3.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 41 games for Oklahoma City this season. 

His new deal is for two years and $7.5million, ESPN reported. 

He said: 'We've been talking about it for a while.

'It's something I'm really happy about. 

'I felt like this is where I wanted to be. This is my team.' 

Below is the exchange between Palmer and Durant about Collison's contract:

Durant and Collison's team, the OKC Thunder, currently have a .500 record at 24-24 and are trailing the Phoenix Suns (28-22) for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference

Palmer's last piece for ESPN was in June 2013 according to the network's website. 

He parted ways with ESPN after having 'an amazing experience'  at the company for 15 years, Inside Hoops reported. 

He said: 'I'm grateful for the opportunity they gave me out of college and thankful to have learned so much from so many talented people over the years.

'I've got so many great memories at ESPN and some terrific friends there but I'm really excited to start a new chapter.'

Palmer has done some work for SlamOnline since leaving ESPN, but also got some mentions on social media after sending out this tweet unintentionally. (He claimed his account was hacked.)

Palmer got his fair share of social media mentions after this tweet was sent out from his account in November

This is not the first time that Palmer and Durant have beefed on social media. 

In July of 2013, Durant implied Palmer took the drug molly, a form of ecstasy, after the hoops writer listed the former No. 2 overall pick as the 15th smartest NBA player. 

It likely didn't help that Palmer listed Metta World Peace, aka Ron Artest, ahead of Durant.  

Durant is averaging 25.1 points, 6.7 rebounds and 4.1 assists this season while shooting better than 50 per cent from the field.

The Thunder currently have a .500 record at 24-24.

They are  trailing the Phoenix Suns (28-22) for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
