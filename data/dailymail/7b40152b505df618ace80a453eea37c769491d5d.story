The prosecutor's decision today to seek the death penalty for Dark Knight 'killer' James Holmes has been applauded by victims and friends of victims who say they want to watch him die.

One friend of Holmes' 12 victims even said he wants to watch the alleged killer die.

'I don't know if it's painful. I want him dead. I just want to be there in the room when he dies,' Bryan Beard told ABC outside the Colorado courthouse. 'He took one of my friends from this Earth. Death equals death.'

Beard's close friend Alex Sullivan was one of the 12 people killed in the shooting on July 20 last year. It was his 27th birthday.

Should Dark Knight 'killer' James Holmes get the death penalty?

Holmes showed no 
reaction when the announcement was made in court today. His parents were
also at the hearing and held hands tightly throughout.

Once the death penalty decision was made, his father nodded his head and put his arm around his wife.

DA George Brauchler said: 'It is my determination and my intention that in this case, for James Eagan Holmes, justice is death.'

He
said he personally spoke to 60 victims' relatives. 800 survivors and 
victim's relatives were contacted in total for their input into the 
decision.

Holmes is charged with 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and other offenses in connection with the attack. He is scheduled to go on trial August 5.

His lawyers are expected to ask to postpone that date if the case moves forward.

Behind-the-scenes maneuvering erupted 
into a public quarrel between prosecutors and the defense over Holmes' 
public offer to plead guilty last week.

Victim Pierce O'Farrill, who was shot three times, said: 'It could be ten 
or 15 years before he's executed. I would be in my 40s and I'm planning 
to have a family, and the thought of having to look back and reliving 
everything at that point in my life, it would be difficult,' he said.

Holmes is accused 
of meticulously planning and brutally executing a plan to attack a 
Colorado movie theater at midnight during a showing of the latest Batman
movie, killing 12 people and injuring 70.

Defense lawyers 
revealed in a court filing last week that Holmes would plead guilty if 
prosecutors allowed him to live out his days in prison with no chance of
parole instead of having him put to death.

That prompted an angry response from prosecutors, who called it an attempt to gin up public support for a plea deal.

Prosecutors also said the defense has repeatedly refused to give them the information they need to evaluate the plea agreement.

If Holmes is 
sentenced to prison, the state Department of Corrections would determine
what kind of mental health care he gets, said Alison Morgan, a 
department spokeswoman.

A third of the 
state's inmates have moderate to severe mental illness, and the prison 
system has an extensive mental health division with a 250-bed facility 
for the acutely mental ill, she said.

Inmates can be 
sent to the state mental hospital in Pueblo – where people found not 
guilty by reason of insanity are committed – but the stay is temporary, 
and they are returned to the prison system after treatment, she said.

A plea bargain would bring finality to the case fairly
early so victims and their families can avoid the prolonged trauma of not
knowing what will happen, said Dan Recht, a past president of the Colorado
Criminal Defense Bar.

‘The defense, by making this public pleading, is reaching
out to the victims' families,’ he said.

Holmes last appeared in court in mid-March. As he has done in past hearings, Holmes 
sat silently through the proceedings. He wore a red jail jumpsuit 
and sported a thick, bushy beard and unkempt dark brown hair.

When he walked into the courtroom, he 
looked at his parents, James and Arlene Holmes. They sat silently at the
front of the room and left without comment after the hearing.

His parents have been in 
relative hiding since the shooting and that was the first court proceeding that they had attended.

During the hearing, defense attorney 
Daniel King said he could not advise Holmes on what plea to enter. He 
said the defense wasn't ready despite previous delays — prompting 
prosecutors to object.

If
a jury agrees he is insane, Holmes would be committed indefinitely to a
state mental hospital. There would be a remote and unlikely chance he 
could be freed one day if doctors find his sanity has been restored.

Prosecutors
laid out a case that Holmes methodically planned the shooting for 
months, amassing an arsenal and elaborately booby-trapping his apartment
to kill anyone who tried to enter.

On
the night of the attack, they say, he donned a police-style helmet, gas
mask and body armor, tossed a gas canister into the seats and then 
opened fire.

Holmes is 
charged with 166 counts, mostly murder and attempted murder, in the 
assault on moviegoers at a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises in 
Aurora.
