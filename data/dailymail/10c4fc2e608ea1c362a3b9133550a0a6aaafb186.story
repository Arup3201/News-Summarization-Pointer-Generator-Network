Tens of thousands of people were cut off from phone and Internet for more than 12 hours in Arizona on Wednesday. 

Vandals cut a fiber-optic line located in a desert north of Phoenix that provides internet and phone services to tens of thousands of people throughout the state.

Although most communication services were restored after being down for six and a half hours, some people were not connected until early on Thursday morning.

Vandals cut through a fiber-optic line (pictured) in Northern Arizona on Wednesday that brought phone and internet services down in large parts of Northern Arizona for six and a half hours 

A Phoenix Police Department officer said vandals had completely cut through the cable, which is located in the desert north of the capital in an area inaccessible to vehicles.

Meanwhile, even in cities 100 miles away from Phoenix, ATM machines stopped working, businesses couldn't process credit cards and residents said they felt lost without the internet. 

Emergency services were also affected in a number of cities. 

Prescott Valley had to supplement 911 service with 'handheld radios and alternate phone numbers'. 

Water and sewer facilities in the region also had to switch to manual operations. 

Emergency lines were also limited in Yavapai County and authorities were unable to access law enforcement databases.  

The Arizona Department of Public Safety helped dispatch police and fire services in Flagstaff.  

Zak Holland, a computer store technician at Northern Arizona University said students panicked when they couldn't go online to complete assignments that were due. 

'It just goes to show how dependent we are on the internet when it disappears,'  Holland told CBS 5. 

A university spokesman said professors could decide how to handle assignments turned in late because of the outage.

And staff at Bookmans Entertainment Exchange, a popular bookstore and cafe in Flagstaff, watched as people left immediately, their computers in tow, when they found out the internet was out. 

Other truckers were stranded in the city because they couldn't use their company gas cards to fill up their tanks. 

Even weather reports couldn't reach some regions. Instead of local temperatures, blank spaces showed up on Phoenix television stations' evening news reports.  

But not everyone was having such a horrible time. 

Tourist Peter Donahower told CBS 5 he was having fun 'kickin' it old school.' 

And although Jessie Hutchison couldn't buy an ice cream because she didn't have cash on hand, she said she only found the situation 'moderately annoying'.  

'It's not going to ruin my day,' she said. 

A spokesman for CenturyLink, which owns the fiber-optic cable, said technicians had to inspect the line 'mile by mile'. 

Services were fully restored by early on Thursday morning. 

The Phoenix Police Department are on site investigating.    

Full restoration of services was not complete until Thursday morning. A spokesman for CenturyLink, which owns the cable, said technicians had to inspect the line 'mile by mile'
