Legal battle: The Fathers4Justice advert that attacked Miss Winslet for suggesting she is against sharing parenting with her ex-husband

With three children by three fathers, Kate Winslet was keen to point out that her offspring weren’t passed ‘from pillar to post’ between parents.

In fact, she could not have been clearer, saying in an interview: ‘None of this 50/50 time with the mums and dads – my children live with me; that is it.’

But Miss Winslet’s declaration has plunged her into a legal battle with campaigners Fathers4Justice, after it emerged the group was planning to use her in a new campaign.

Miss Winslet’s lawyers have threatened to sue the group after discovering it plans to publish an advert attacking the Oscar-winner for suggesting she is against shared parenting with her ex-husbands.

The advert features the comments about her children – given in an interview with Vogue – under a close-up of the actress and a headline saying: ‘Kate, every child deserves their father this Christmas’.

Fathers4Justice say they have also been contacted by Miss Winslet’s ex-husband Sam Mendes.

The film director told them: ‘It is inappropriate for this organisation to involve my family and I when they know nothing of our personal circumstances.

'Whilst I fully support fathers’ rights, I can happily state this has never been a concern for me or my son.’

Miss Winslet’s solicitors issued the group with a letter on Tuesday claiming the advert, which Fathers4Justice says is due to appear imminently, was ‘misleading and seriously defamatory’.

Mother-of-three Kate Winslet targeted by Fathers4Justice advertising campaign for saying 'my children live with me'

The mother, pictured here with third husband Ned Rocknroll, allegedly said in an interview that her children weren't passed 'from pillar to post'

Fathers4Justice said it initially 
agreed to hold off from placing the adverts to give the 38-year-old time
 to confirm that her comments were accurate.

However,
 they said yesterday that no explanation had been forthcoming and they 
planned to continue with their attempts to place the advert.

Miss Winslet gave birth to her third child, a boy, 11 days ago. It is her first with third husband, Ned RocknRoll.

She
 also has a 13-year-old daughter, Mia, from her first marriage to 
director Jim Threapleton and a nine-year-old son, Joe, from her marriage
 to Mr Mendes.

In a letter to the organisation, Mr Mendes claimed the advert was 'false and damaging', the campaign group alleged

In the Vogue interview, the actress defended herself against accusations that her children were the victims of her divorces.

She said: ‘People go, “Oh, my God! Those poor children! They must have gone through so much”.

'Says who? They’ve always been with me. They don’t go from pillar to post; they’re not flown here and there with nannies.

'That’s
 never happened. My kids don’t go back and forth; none of this 50/50 
time with the mums and dads – my children live with me; that is it. That
 is it!’

Nadine O’Connor of 
Fathers4Justice said: ‘We believe the content of the advert is accurate,
 balanced and reflective of her comments. Fathers4Justice has not made 
any comment in our advert about the personal arrangements of Kate 
Winslet and the fathers of her children.’

In 2004 Mr Threapleton spoke out in support of the group, claiming he went months without seeing Mia.
