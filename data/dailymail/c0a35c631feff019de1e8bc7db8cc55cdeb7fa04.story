He's been tipped for a new career as a pilot in the Royal Air Ambulance service, and today, Prince William appeared to confirm his new role after asking to be shown around a Scottish Air Ambulance helicopter during a visit to Scotland.

Arriving at the Strathearn Community College in the small town of Crieff with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge in their first official engagement since the tour of Australia and New Zealand, the Duke made a beeline for the helicopter which was parked on the college playing field.

William, 31, had asked, through 
his office, to meet the crew, staff and charity trustees. 'He was really
 really keen,' said John Pritchard, lead paramedic on the helicopter. 'He
 was really keen to see how we work.'

Earlier this week, it emerged that the 
second in line the throne, who left his job as an RAF search and rescue 
pilot in September, is considering returning to flying as a career from 
this September, possibly as a helicopter pilot for the air ambulance 
service in East Anglia.

New job? Prince William was fascinated by the helicopter owned by the
 Scottish Air Ambulance and may soon be flying one of the aircraft himself

Is that for George? The royal couple were wreathed in smiles after being presented with a huge teddy bear that sported a kilt

Aides conspicuously refused to rule it out even though they had insisted in April that it was not under consideration, at the same time as William was telling people he wanted to do something involving flying again and was going for his commercial pilot's licence.

'Are you guys volunteers then? How long have you been doing it?' William asked when he met the crew of the twin-engine Bollow 105 helicopter, which supplements the work of two Government-funded air ambulances in Scotland.

Alan Bell, one of the founder trustees of the service, which has been operating for just over a year and been called out to about 300 emergencies, said: 'He was very very interested. He knew quite a lot about the air ambulance network in England and Wales.'

But the future King said nothing about his own future career plans. 'He never said anything about it but I would certainly welcome him on to the team,' said Mr Pritchard, 46, one of two paramedics who work on board with a pilot, who must have a commercial licence.

William, who asked detailed questions about the aircraft and the work of the team, recalled his own flying experiences and learned how the crew give a teddy bear to any child they treat. He was given one of the teddy bears for Prince George.

Jonathan Saunders, a dress by Goat, and a Celtic knotwork brooch that 
was a wedding gift.

The 
couple, who are known as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn north of the border, flew up to Scotland last night and stayed at the nearby 
Gleneagles Hotel beside the golf course where this year's Ryder Cup will
 be played.

Kate,
 who works as a volunteer with the Scouts, was showered with gifts 
including a tartan neckerchief and tried a small piece of Scottish 
pancake made by the Muthill Scouts. 'Lovely,' she said, telling one 
group of girls: 'I was a Brownie but I never made it to the Guides.'

She
 also praised young volunteers for combining their work with exams. 'I 
don't know how you manage to do it,' she told Guides young leader Rachel
 Hutchison, 16. 'Well done you!'

Next on their busy schedule was a trip to MacRosty Park for a plaque unveiling. Opened in 1902 and named after its 
benefactor, James MacRosty, the park in Crieff has been restored as 
Queen Elizabeth 11 Field in Trust and an award-winning green space.

From there William and Kate were whisked off to the Famous 
Grouse Distillery in Glenturret, where they were pictured enjoying a 'wee dram'.

After getting a taste of a proper Scotch single malt, the Duke and Duchess ended their day in the pretty village of Forteviot, where they were given a tour of the village fete by John Dewan, Lord Fonteviot, the scion of the Dewan whisky dynasty.
