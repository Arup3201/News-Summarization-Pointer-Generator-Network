Harry Kane is set to play for the England Under-21s at the European Championships this summer with the backing of senior boss Roy Hodgson.

Kane enjoyed a dream debut for Hodgson's men on Friday night as he netted just 79 seconds after coming off the bench against Lithuania to add to the 29 goals he has scored for Tottenham this season.

The 21-year-old is in line to get his first start against Italy on Tuesday night but that looks likely to be his last senior appearance until September as Under-21 boss Gareth Southgate is confident of taking the striker to the Czech Republic.

England have a friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 and a European Championship qualifier against Slovenia a week later but Southgate has revealed that Hodgson has given the green light for Kane to play in the Under-21 tournament which begins on June 17.

'Roy and I know that the seniors are in a good group position and he feels that the experience of going to the Czech Republic in the summer will be more beneficial to Harry than the two games he has got,' Southgate said. 'That is absolutely the case regardless of his displays between now and then.

'We are not short of good players in the seniors, but understandably for Harry to be there this time, against Lithuania, was merited.

'We still feel we can give the players the best possible preparation to go into the seniors and achieve success if they have got the experience of the European Under-21 Championships behind them. That is still the case with Harry.'
