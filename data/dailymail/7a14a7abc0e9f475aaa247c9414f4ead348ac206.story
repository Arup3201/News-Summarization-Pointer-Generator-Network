Actress and singer Anna Kendrick has added yet another string to her bow by starring in an upcoming fashion campaign for designer Kate Spade.

The 29-year-old actress, who will soon be seen starring as Cinderella in upcoming big screen musical Into The Woods, due out on Christmas Day, spent the day in Las Vegas shooting the campaign - alongside eight male models who she revealed spent the day 'cracking her up'.

'There were eight guys on the shoot with me who were just cracking me up!' she told People. 'Mostly in their 50s and 60s but a couple in their 30s, and the photographer kept being like, "Just try to get her attention. Try to get her to laugh."

Despite her obvious talent as a model, Anna, 29, recently revealed in an interview with the Associated Press that she didn't - and couldn't - consider the Kate Spade shoot as a proper modelling job.

'If I had for one moment considered it modeling, I probably would've had a freakout,' she said. 'Weirdly it felt a lot more like my day job than it did like modeling.

She added: 'Kate Spade has really embraced me being me, which is great because it would be a lot harder to not be. So you know I'm glad that they don't mind a little quirk and a little sass.'
