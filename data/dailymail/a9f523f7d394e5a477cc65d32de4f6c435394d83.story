Chelsea and Arsenal's hopes of signing Sami Khedira suffered a blow after Carlo Ancelotti insisted the German midfielder would not be leaving Real Madrid this season.

Despite the World Cup winner's contract expiring at the end of the season, Ancelotti is desperate to keep Khedira at the Bernabeu - although the Champions League holders are reportedly willing to listen to offers of £10million.

Both London clubs have been linked with moves for the 27-year-old, with Chelsea understood to be willing to offer him a lucrative pre-contract before signing him on a free transfer next summer - while Arsenal could prepare another bid in January.

However, Ancelotti has ruled out a mid-season move in the hope he can convince Khedira to stay, despite the player rejecting two offers of a new contract.

The Italian coach told the Evening Standard: 'We have until June to reach an agreement with him. If he wants to sign an extension, the club will renew him. If not, he will leave the team at the end of the season.'

Khedira was not used during Real Madrid's 5-0 victory at Levante on Saturday as he continues to recover from a knee injury that has sidelined him since September, but he could be in contention for Wednesday's Champions League clash with Liverpool.  

'Khedira has come back really well, he trained with the squad and he's ready to play. Of course he's not in optimal condition after missing the last 40 days, but he's an important player for us,' added Ancelotti.
