A family who falsely claimed £226,000 in benefits in one of the worst frauds a judge has ever seen were caught after their daughter was seen swimming with dolphins - despite claiming she couldn't walk.

Samuel Bennett and his wife Patricia, both 64, claimed disability living allowance between 2002 and 2012 on the basis they were so ill they could not walk and needed 24 hour care.

But they had lied about their disabilities, and were going on luxury holidays abroad and driving high end cars including an Audi and a BMW, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

They had also claimed disability benefits for their daughter Danielle Bennett, 30, of Everton, since she was a child. 

The court was told when she was an adult she maintained the lies, saying she was virtually unable to walk, needed 24-hour care, had systemic sclerosis, arthritis, Raynaud's disease, psoriasis and depression.

Samuel Bennett said he had heart problems, depression and asthma whilst his wife claimed to have arthritis, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome and a hiatus hernia.

The couple, of West Derby, said they could only walk a few yards before falling over and needed sticks and other aids to do so.

But they had lied about their supposed infirmities and had in fact embarked on nine luxury holidays over the period including to Australia, on a Caribbean cruise and to America three times.

Footage seized by Department for Work and Pensions showed no evidence of disability at all.

It showed Danielle diving into swimming pools, pulling a child on a suitcase and working as a beautician. 

Old claim forms were found with notes written on them such as: 'Just make it worse - think how this would sound', and 'Use this one (disability), we've used that one before'.

Patricia Bennett arrives at Liverpool Crown Court, charged with benefit fraud. Samuel Bennett fraudulently obtained benefits amounting to £47,163 over ten years, Patricia £70,377 and Danielle £108,614

Samuel Bennett fraudulently obtained benefits amounting to £47,163 over ten years, Patricia £70,377 and Danielle £108,614 - making a total of £226,000.

Sentencing them at Liverpool Crown Court Judge Denis Watson, QC, said: 'In almost 30 years of my experience of the criminal courts this is the worst example of benefit fraud that I have personally had to deal with.

'You regarded the funds of the DWP, as it now is, as funds for your personal use. You employed repeated and blatant lies to obtain significant amounts of money.'

Danielle, 30, was sentenced to 18 months in prison, Samuel nine months, and Patricia 27 months.
