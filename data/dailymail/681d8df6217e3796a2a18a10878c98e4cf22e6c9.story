The 19-year-old daughter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr reportedly freaked out at staff at an upstate New York club when they refused to allow her in with a fake ID, screaming: 'I am a Kennedy, Google me!'

Kyra Kennedy allegedly threw a tantrum after being turned away from club Lava at the Turning Stone Resort Casino in Verona, New York last Thursday.

The teen had tried to use 26-year-old Kick Kennedy's passport but couldn't remember her half-sister's birthday and was caught looking up the date of birth on Wikipedia by a security guard.

An eagle-eyed security guard at the Lava club at the casino complex in Verona, New York spotted that the 19-year-old was using the wrong ID last Thursday

After being turned away from the club, she screamed: 'I am a Kennedy, Google me!', The New York Post reported, quoting a source.   

One witness said Kyra, a great-niece of JFK, then threatened: 'If you don't let me in, the governor will be calling.'

When she was still refused entry to the over-21s club, she went to scream at the front desk staff that she would sue. 

Turning Stone Resort Casino would not comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online on Tuesday.

Miss Kennedy was visiting friends for the weekend at Syracuse University. Andrew Warren posted a picture to his Instagram account of the pre-party in a hotel room where Kennedy and friends Gaia Matisse and Julia Moshy posed up in their lingerie in front of a table laden with vodka and tequila.

Friend Gaia Matisse told Daily Mail Online that the story had been exaggerated and blown out of proportion. 

Miss Matisse said she was not aware of Kyra drinking before going to the club.

She added: 'I do not know the details, except the fact that after Kyra was declined she went back to the hotel room and went to sleep.'

Kyra Kennedy's social media accounts reveal that she is no stranger to partying, posting shots of her attending events around the world.

In 2013, the teen, daughter of RFK Jr and the late Mary Richardson Kennedy, made her society debut at the Paris Bal des débutantes in Christian Dior. 

She was accompanied by her father and his then girlfriend, actress Cheryl Hines. The couple married last year.  

Kyra is an aspiring fashion designer and has had internships at Dior and Kenneth Cole.

Using a fake ID in New York (which includes borrowing someone else's real ID), can lead to penalties including fines and community service.

However, altering an official ID may constitute 'possession of a forged instrument' - a class-D felony under New York State penal law. 

Kick Kennedy, who is RFK's daughter with his first wife Emily Black, is an actress who has been in TV shows The Newsroom, Gossip Girl and Curb Your Enthusiasm (which also stars RFK Jr's new wife Cheryl).
