The owners of a rottweiler cross dog were fined $10,000 after they failed to treat their dog for a skin condition that caused him to gnaw on his skin until his teeth wore down 'to the pulp'.

The Balga couple were found guilty of animal cruelty in Perth Magistrates Court on Friday for the severe neglect of their dog named Snoopy that eventually claimed his life.

Fly-in-fly-out worker Deborah Hayes and her partner, William John Warmdean, were hit with a $5000 fine each. Hayes was banned from owning a pet for five years.

Snoopy was found in the Perth suburb of Balga in Western Australia in August last year

Warmdean was charged with the neglect because Snoopy was in his care at the time of the incident.

He was also fined an extra $1000 for failing to follow directions given to him by an RSPCA inspector and slapped with a five-year probation order for severe neglect.

On August 31, RSPCA inspectors first visited a Balga property after they received a complaint about a rottweiler cross dog being kept in terrible conditions.

It was also reported the dog had a severe skin condition that caused him to lose almost all of his fur and was unable to stop scratching.

It was found by RSPCA vets that he was suffering from a bacterial skin infection amongst other conditions

His owners were fined $10,000 on Friday at Perth Magistrates Court for neglect that caused most of his fur to fall out

When inspectors arrived they were met with potent stench and as they got closer to the dog a distinct yeast smell could be detected from metres away.

Warmdean refused to surrender the dog so he was told to take the dog to a veterinarian for treatment.

Two weeks later, despite repeated attempts to get the dog help, Snoopy was seized - still untreated - and taken back to a RSPCA veterinary clinic for immediate attention.

RSCPA inspectors visited the property after receiving complaints from neighbours about the conditions Snoopy was living in

Unfortunately vets were unable to save Snoopy who had worn his teeth  down 'to the pulp' because of his constant gnawing of his irritated skin

It was discovered the dog was suffering from several conditions, including a severe skin condition and a bacterial skin infection that caused skin to thicken as well as scaling and crusting to his body and trunk. The only areas left untouched were his paws and muzzle.

RSPCA chief inspector Amanda Swift said these conditions were treatable and could have been prevented.

She labelled it as a 'disgusting case of neglect'.

On approach, inspectors were met with a distinctive yeast stench when they arrived at Snoopy's home

Deborah Hayes was banned from owning a pet for five years and William John Warmdean was fined an additional $1000 as well as being slapped with five years probation for neglect

'This poor dog had worn his teeth to the pulp from chewing his own skin given the irritation associated with the condition,' Ms Swift said.

'Several attempts were made to direct and assist the owners to fix the situation and have them seek veterinary attention but they were ignored.

'Unfortunately on this occasion, Snoopy's condition was too far advanced and we were unable to save him.

'It's disappointing to think that in today's society an animal has suffered in this unnecessary way.'
