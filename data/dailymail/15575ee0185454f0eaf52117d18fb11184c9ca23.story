Could Friday the 13th at Ibrox really have been anything other than another gruesome evening for Rangers?

Not when Hibernian are the visitors. A third successive victory over this crippled giant saw Alan Stubbs’ side leapfrog their hosts into second place in the Championship standings. True, they have played three games more but there is only one club here with positive momentum. And they don’t wear blue.

Having witnessed just one defeat in their last 18 league outings, fans of the Easter Road club will awake on Valentine’s Day with a deepened love of their emerging side.

For Rangers, the contrast could not be greater. After chanting against a despised board for much of the game, one section of supporters turned their ire directly towards the players. ‘You’re not fit to wear the shirt’ was the damning verdict.

After a dire sequence of six defeats from their last ten outings, no one in Kenny McDowall’s squad could consider any slander action.

This wasn’t an overall Hibs performance to rank close to those which established a 7-1 aggregate in the two previous league meetings.

For long spells, they were pressed back into their own half by their own territory. But that mattered little come the final whistle.

Through goals from Scott Robertson and Lewis Stevenson, the Easter Road men had the cutting edge where Rangers had none. And 9-1 over three games still sounds just dandy to all from Leith.

Initially at least, it looked as though Rangers were in the mood to find some redemption.

Kris Boyd flicked on to Haris Vuckic and he engineered space for a drive that was beaten out by Mark Oxley.

Miller seized upon the follow-up but his rising shot was headed off the line by Liam Fontaine.

There was a freshness about some of Rangers’ early play that was in stark contrast to their recent stale offerings.

Another nice interchange saw a Miller right-foot thump from 25 yards tipped over the top by Oxley. Vuckic delivered the resulting corner towards the near post and Boyd glanced in a header that zipped narrowly wide.

These were signs of encouragement from a home support that once again left significant patches of empty blue seats around the ground.

Further frustration and anguish is, however, never far from the surface in these parts. And Hibs made it bubble up once again by clicking into gear to claim a 19th-minute lead.

It was, it must be said, a strike that owed much to the static defending of their opponents.

Scott Allan arrowed a pass into the area that found its way to Jason Cummings. He got beyond McGregor too easily but was thwarted as Robinson bolted off his line to save.

The reprieve for Rangers was fleeting. Robertson reacted quicker than Murdoch to the loose ball and slotted home with ease.

The Hibs fans celebrated with abandon, with stewards and police forced to move in to re-establish segregation at the corner of the Sandy Jardine and Broomloan Road stands after apparent scuffles.

Now the test for the Ibrox players was to respond far better than they did in September. Back then, a Hibs opener was the signal for a full-scale first-half collapse. There was more resistance this time, but not enough to force a leveller before the interval.

Their cause was not aided when Miller hobbled out to be replaced by Nicky Clark. And it wasn’t long before the substitute toppled inside the area after linking with Boyd and trying to get beyond Watson. The home fans hollered at referee Steven McLean for a penalty, but the lack of reaction from Clark suggested a slip.

As it was, the second period opened in a similar vein. Rangers pressed with Hibs trying to absorb and wait for counter-attacking opportunities.

Vuckic went down too easily when picked out by Lee Wallace. The Slovenian had Paul Hanlon at his back but would have been better advised trying to get a shot away.

To be fair, though, Vuckic was again looking like a capable performer. A well-flighted free-kick picked out Boyd, whose header drifted off target.

Having someone in the side who can take a decent set-piece counts as a novelty for the Ibrox men. Faure got himself on the end of another Vuckic corner, but the Frenchman’s looping header was tipped away by Oxley at full stretch.

There was a sense of pressure building, of an equaliser looming but Boyd — making his first start since December 6 — blew a prime opportunity to achieve that aim on 57 minutes. A deep, arcing cross found him in space at the far post but the striker’s header was woefully misdirected.

Despite that miss, Stubbs recognised the danger of his side drifting out of proceedings too much out and withdrew Cummings in the hope Martin Boyle would provide new impetus.

McDowall played his final hand with 13 minutes remaining — and promptly drew the ire of the Ibrox crowd for withdrawing Vuckic to introduce Dean Shiels. Jon Daly replaced Boyd in the other half of a double switch.

It mattered little. With nine minutes remaining, Hibs sealed their hat-trick of wins over Rangers with an exquisite goal.

Fraser Fyvie, on for Allan, dinked a delightful pass into the area and Stevenson finished first time beyond Robinson. It was, frankly, the kind of finesse that their opponents so dearly lack.
