A fifth person has been arrested over a savage hammer attack at an upmarket London hotel that hospitalised three wealthy tourists.

The 32-year-old man was picked up by police today, in Islington, north London, on suspicion of attempted murder and is currently being questioned.

Three other men, aged 56, 34 and 32, have already been arrested in connection with the attack, and police have been given more time to quiz them about what happened.

The Cumberland Hotel, near Marble Arch, has a four-star rating and 1,000 rooms, including a Jimi Hendrix suite

A woman, 31, has also been held on suspicion of handling stolen goods.

The attack took place when a lone man managed to get into the seventh-floor room at the four-star Cumberland Hotel, near Marble Arch in Londonâ€™s West End, in the early hours of Sunday morning.

The three victims - sisters from the United Arab Emirates - were asleep in the room at the time and, when one woke up, the man set upon her with a hammer and then turned on the other two before fleeing the hotel in bloodstained clothes.

One of the victims, Khuloud Al Muhairi, 36, is still in a critical condition more than four days after the attack.

The other two, Fatimah Al Muhairi, 31, and Ohoud Al Muhairi, 34, remain in hospital but their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

A fourth woman, who was staying next door when the attack took place and ran down to the first screaming for help, is believed to be 18-year-old relative Shekha Al Mauhairi.

The sisters were part of a large family group staying at the hotel while on holiday from the United Arab Emirates

The teenager posted messages on Twitter just moments after the incident.

She wrote: 'I am 18 years old and someone has attacked my family.'

She then tweeted: 'I'm in London. Some foreigner from London came and attacked us.'

In a final tweet she said that she has now moved to another hotel and is being looked after by security. Her tweets have since been deleted.

The women, who are in their thirties, had travelled to London for a shopping spree

It is understood that the three women had deliberately left their door unlocked because they were staying in the hotel as part of a large family group.

The wealthy family, arrived in the UK between April 3 and 5 for a holiday of shopping and sightseeing and the women had visited large West End stores the day before they were attacked.

No keys were stolen from the hotel and police said there had been no breach of security at the venue. Detectives are scouring CCTV to establish the movements of the women and their attacker earlier in the day.

The Cumberland Hotel is near Europe's busiest shopping street, Oxford Street, and has 1,000 rooms including a Jimi Hendrix suite.
