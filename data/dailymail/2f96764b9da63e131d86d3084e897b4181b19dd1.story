Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson ensured he didn't miss Louis van Gaal's first FA Cup game after taking a helicopter to Somerset to see the Red Devils in action.

United beat League One side Yeovil Town 2-0 on Sunday afternoon and Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, flew in to watch the game from the stands at Huish Park.

Having been humiliated 4-0 by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup second round in August and with no European football this term, the game against Gary Johnson's struggling side was only Van Gaal's second outside of the Premier League fixture list.

And Ferguson, who led United to five FA Cup triumphs during his 26-and-a-half years at Old Trafford, was clearly keen to see his former side begin their own charge to Wembley.

The 73-year-old was mobbed by autograph hunters as he entered Yeovil's 9,500 capacity stadium to take his seat  - next to racing trainer Paul Nicholls. 

Ferguson will have left with a smile on his face after goals from summer signings Ander Herrrera and Angel di Maria ensured United will be in the fourth round draw.
