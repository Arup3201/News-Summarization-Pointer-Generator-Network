A postman has been jailed for stealing hundreds of packages containing valuables and then making £15,500 by selling them online.

Andrew Barratt, 49, took an estimated 400 items such as satnavs, digital cameras and computer games which his wife Michelle, 38, then auctioned on eBay.

Their scam was foiled in April 2012 when Royal Mail investigators posted an iPad with a tracking device. It failed to arrive and was followed to their home in Stockport.

Barratt, a postman for 14 years, was arrested in his uniform and has now been sacked. 

He was jailed for 15 months after admitting theft and converting criminal property.

His wife was given 120 hours' unpaid work after pleading guilty to converting criminal property. 

At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Judge Leslie Hull said they had run 'a thoroughly dishonest scheme'.

Most of the items had been sent out by Amazon – which had reported around 2,000 lost packages in the postcodes where Barratt worked.

An eBay account under the name 'ShellB76' run by Mrs Barratt was found to have sold 463 items – most of them electrical goods – since June 2010. Their retail value was almost £21,000.

Two of the items – a camcorder and a Sony Walkman – had been reported stolen to police.

She told detectives she had bought the items at car boot sales, despite the fact many of the sales were computer games which had been released just days earlier.

The couple eventually pleaded guilty on the day of their trial.

Defending Mr Barratt, Milena Bennett said he had stolen the goods while 'self-medicating' psoriasis with cannabis and amphetamines.

A Royal Mail spokesman confirmed Barratt was sacked and said they seek to prosecute any members of staff who tampers with mail.

He said: 'Royal Mail has a zero tolerance approach to any dishonesty and that stance is shared by the overwhelming majority of postmen and women. 

'We will not allow the actions of any individual to damage the good reputation of our thousands of hard-working postmen and women.

'It is a criminal offence to tamper with or delay the delivery of mail and anyone caught doing so will face serious disciplinary measures.

'Royal Mail will always seek to prosecute the tiny minority of people who abuse their position of trust.'
