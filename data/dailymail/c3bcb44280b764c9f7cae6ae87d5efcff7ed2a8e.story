A Sky Sports presenter was forced to apologise on air today after former England football manager Terry Venables appeared to make a homophobic 'joke'.

Venables, who also played for England before managing Crystal Palace, Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur, was being interviewed on Sky show Goals on Sunday.

Speaking about the 1991 FA Cup final at Wembley, Venables told an anecdote about how then Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough held his hand as the two team walked out onto the pitch.

Appearing on Sky Sports, Terry Venables told an anecdote about how then Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough held his hand as the two team walked out onto the pitch before the 1991 FA Cup final

The Dagenham-born 71-year-old said: 'As I come out he grips my right hand with his left hand and I'm clamped, I'm clamped.'

Venables appears to say they looked like a 'pair of woofters'.

Sky Sports presenter and former footballer Chris Kamara, sitting on the sofa opposite, then laughed loudly, while the show's host Ben Shephard looked uncomfortable.

The 39-year-old then apologised for Venables' comment.

Venables'
 Spurs team beat Clough's Forest side 2-1, after an own goal by Des 
Walker, to win the cup for a then-record eighth time.

During the 1960s and 70s, he played 
for various clubs including Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park 
Rangers, and gained two caps for England.

He
 was the national team manager of England from 1994 to 1996, leading the
 team to the semi-finals of the 1996 European Championships, and of 
Australia from 1997 to 1998.

Many social media commentators were unimpressed with the outburst.

Alan Machnik took to Twitter to say: 'Terry Venables on Goals on Sunday using the phrase 'couple of woofters'. Apparently he's now booked for Top Gear to talk about black people.'

Barry Collins tweeted: 'Whoops. A bit of low-level homophobia from Terry Venables on Goals on Sunday. That'll do his job prospects the world of good.'

Richard Lane, spokesman for gay rights organisation Stonewall, said: 'This kind of language might have been acceptable in 1991 but seems really rather dated in Britain today.'
