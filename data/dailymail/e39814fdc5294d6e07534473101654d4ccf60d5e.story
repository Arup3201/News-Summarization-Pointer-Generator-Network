These are the first pictures inside the cockpit of the new U.S. military-funded airship that is set to revolutionise long-haul flying.

The massive blimp-like aircraft made its first successful test flight after hovering a dozen feet off the floor of the former military hangar during flight testing south of Los Angeles.

The fact that the hulking Aeroscraft could fly for just a few minutes represents a step forward in aviation, according to the engineers who developed it.

Sitting in the high-tech cockpit, flight control engineer Munir Jojo-Verge told of his pride at being involved in the groundbreaking project.

'I realised that I put a little dot in
the line of aviation history. A little dot for something that has never
been demonstrated before, now it's feasible,' he told the Associated Press.

The high-tech Aeroscraft blimp is now 
nearly ready for flight testing in the open, having completed its 'first float' 
manoeuvres inside its colossal hangar in Orange County, California.

The biggest challenge for engineers is
making sure the airship will be able to withstand high winds and other 
extreme weather conditions, Mr Jojo-Verge said.

The Department of Defense and NASA 
have invested $35 million in project because of its potential to 
one day carry more cargo than any other aircraft to disaster zones and 
forward military bases.

Built around a rigid frame of 
aluminium and carbon fibre, the huge 230ft prototype, built by U.S. 
aviation firm Worldwide Aeros, is nevertheless only 
half the size of its conceived finished version.

Earlier pictures of the bulbous blimp, with its silver skin reflecting green lights shining within the hangar, invited comparisons with Thunderbird 2, the rescue craft from Gerry Anderson's puppet adventure series Thunderbirds.

The airship has been undergoing 
testing this
month in a 17-storey tall, Second World War-era blimp hangar at the 
former Tustin Marine Corps Air Station. It must go through several more 
rounds of flight tests before it could be used in a disaster zone or 
anywhere else.

But if and when it finally goes into 
service, the Aeroscraft airship will carry three times as much as the 
biggest military cargo planes, use a third of 
the fuel - and it won't even need a landing strip.

It could revolutionise haulage, and 
almost everything now laboriously transported across the planet's 
surface by boat, train and lorry could within years be carried through 
the skies, its makers claim.

Aeros said it also must secure more 
funding for the next round of flight testing, but is hopeful the Defense
Department and others will step in again as investors.

It says the cargo airship's potential 
to carry more cargo more efficiently than ever before would provide the 
military with an advantage on the battlefield and greater capacity to 
save more lives during natural disasters.

Aeros CEO and Founder Igor Pasternak 
recently confirmed the vehicle had completed a series of successful 
'first float' manoeuvres inside its immense engineering hangar.

Mr Pasternak, who is also the chief 
engineer of the Aeroscraft, explained that the tests had proven its 
unique lightweight rigid structure conception and vertical take off and 
landing systems.

'The first float of the vehicle was a 
controlled exercise during which all flight systems were operating. The 
procedure was completed successfully,' he said.

Aircraft experts are betting that the Aeroscraft vehicle with its advanced 
technology capabilities will transform the transportation of large and 
heavy cargoes.

It has the potential to support any 
number of the world’s equipment-dependent mega-projects and the 
industries that manage them – including wind energy, aerospace, fossil 
fuel extraction, highway construction, engineering and 
telecommunications.

A concept of the airship on the battlefield, where it could be used to transport tanks and soldiers directly onto the front line

The airship functions like a 
submarine, releasing air to rise and taking in air to descend, said 
Aeros mechanical engineer Tim Kenny.

It can take off vertically, like a helicopter, then change its buoyancy to become heavier than air for landing and unloading.

'It allows the vehicle to set down on 
the ground. And then when we want to become lighter than air, we release
that air and then the vehicle floats and we can allow it to take off,' 
Mr Kenny said.

The radical design has been likened to that of Thunderbird 2

The project has set abuzz the old 
hangars at the Marine Corps Air Station.

The structures were built to 
hold blimps during the War. Now workers zip around in 
cherry-pickers, and the airship's silvery surface shines against the 
warm tones of the aging wood of the walls.

'You could take this vehicle and go to
destinations that have been destroyed, where there's no ports, no 
runways, stuff like that,' said Mr Kenny

'This vehicle could go in there, 
offload the cargo even if there's no infrastructure, no landing site for
it to land on, this vehicle can unload its whole payload. '

The finished version of the Aeroscraft
- expected to be ready in three years - will be 450ft long and carry a 
payload of 66 tons at a speed of 120 knots, up to 18,000ft with a range 
of 3000 nautical miles.

That could revolutionise air transport, opening up remote areas where there is practically no other means of access.

It could carry relief supplies for 
victims in disaster areas, heavy oil-extraction equipment to northern 
Canada's tar sands, huge turbines to remote wind farms and, of course, 
heavy military equipment to battlefields worldwide.

Fill 'er up: At 77m (250ft) in length, the prototype Aeroscraft is just half the size of the final model, but has been built with the same rigid structure, flight control systems and landing gear

The 'skeleton' of the airship being built in California

The key breakthrough has been the development of an internal system for managing ballast.

Previous airships have been held back 
by the need to weigh them down or tie them up while cargo is unloaded, 
lest they are suddenly carried away on the breeze.

But the Aeroscraft's internal ballast 
management system gives its operators the ability to control the 
aircraft's buoyancy by compressing the helium inside its tanks and 
replacing it with normal air to bring down to the ground.

Once cargo has been loaded, the 
airship can rise by re-releasing the compressed helium into its 
containment tanks, making it again lighter than air, then using 
turbo-prop engines to control its direction.

Because of this revolutionary system, 
Aeroscraft needs no airfield to operate, only a cleared area large 
enough for it to vertically take off and land, and enough labour on hand
to unload the cargo.

Limited: Conventional airships are held back by the need for infrastructure that can enable ground crews to fill them with ballast as they are unloaded to stop them from floating away on the breeze

Internal ballast: The Aeroscraft, by contrast, is able to control its buoyancy using an internal ballast management system which means it can land anywhere that there is space to touch down

Mr Pasternak, 48, told Gizmag: 'The 
advantage is you don’t need ground infrastructure. You can fly anywhere,
you can land anywhere, you don’t need any ballast, you don’t need any 
ground crew.'

The airship has long been a 'dream machine' for visionary inventors.

Count Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin 
built the first airship in 1900 as a weapon for Germany. The 'Graf 
Zeppelin' was developed by Dr Hugo Eckener, who flew it around the world
in 21 days in 1929.

This powerful symbol of German might 
was adopted by the Nazis, who funded the creation of the largest airship
yet, the Hindenburg.

However, on May 6, 1937, the 
Hindenburg burst into flames on a trip to the US, having been filled 
with patriotic German hydrogen instead of American helium.

The future: An artist's impression shows how the Aeroscraft might look as it picks up cargo from a distribution centre. Finished models will carry 66 tons over a distance of 3,000 nautical miles at 120 knots

The ship could also be used for major construction projects such as building large pipes, as it does not require a runway to land

But Ukrainian-born Mr Pasternak says 
that his design for a rigid airship is miles apart from the disastrous 
versions of the early 20th Century.

He told Gizmag: 'From the structure stand point, all of us are familiar with the Hindenburg and Zeppelin designs.

'This is different. We built a space 
frame that sits inside of the vehicle and around the frame we built a 
rigid cell. The function of the rigid cell is to have it work with the 
aerodynamic laws. It’s a very simple approach.

'It also allows us to build vehicles 
very rapidly. When you’re talking about the production of vehicles, you 
need the ability to build number of them in a short term and with the 
frames you can do this.'
