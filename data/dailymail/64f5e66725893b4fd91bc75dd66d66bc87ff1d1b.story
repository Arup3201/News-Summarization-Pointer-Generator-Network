This is the dramatic moment two Nascar drivers had a miraculous escape after a fiery crash at Kansas Speedway.

Justin Allgaier, 27, and David Gilliland, 38, were able to walk away without serious injury after the collision at the Kansas City racetrack, with the latter's car taking to the air before bursting into flames.

Despite the terrifying nature of the crash neither of the men were hurt, with Gilliland somewhat nonchalantly describing the incident as 'a tough way to end our night'.

Damage: Justin Allgaier is pictured being helped out of his car after crashing with 84 laps to go in the Five-Hour Energy 400 race. He was heard on radio telling his crew that he was fine, just slightly out of breath

The crash took place with 84 laps to go in the Five-Hour Energy 400, shortly after the race restarted.

As the cars went into turn three at 1.5mile long race track, driver A.J. Allmendinger made an attempt at passing Paul Menard in his Chevrolet SS.

Unfortunately A.J. Allmendinger's left wheels touched the apron - the part of the track where the flat middle section of the track meets the steep bank - and he spun into the side of Allgaier's car.

In turn the Sprint Cup rookie's own Chevrolet SS began to slide - directly into the path of Gilliland's oncoming Ford Fusion.Â

The collision between the Chevrolet and the Ford was particularly hard, sending Gilliland into the safety barrier and causing his car to become momentarily airborne.

As it landed the vehicle burst into a ball of flames with its entire front end dramatically caved in.

Shortly after the crash, Fox News replayed a radio interaction between Allgaier and his team in the pit lane and techical area.

'Holy c*** was that a hit,' he gasped, while telling his crew that he was fine, just slightly out of breath.

During an interview after the race, Gilliland said the crash was 'the hardest hit I've had in a while'.

'It was just a tough hit and a tough way to end our night,' he added.

Neither Allgaier or Gilliland suffered serious injury as a result of the crash, with both being treated and released at the Kansas Speedway's medical centre.

The race restarted with 74 laps to go.

There was another fiery crash at the racetrack just half an hour before the incident involving Allgaier and Gilliland.

Jamie McMurray, who was in fourth at the time, suffered a rear tire blowout and crashed hard into the turn four wall on lap 150.

Another Chevrolet SS driver, McMurray's vehicle caught fire and rolled some distance before coming to a stop.

Officials pulled the 37-year-old from the burning wreckage but he was able to walk away unscathed.
