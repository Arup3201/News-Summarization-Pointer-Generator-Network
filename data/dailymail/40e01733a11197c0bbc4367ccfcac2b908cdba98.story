These CCTV images appear innocent enough - a 'respectable looking' middle-aged couple stroll casually down a shopping aisle laden with a basket and baby pram.

In fact, the pair pictured are serial shoplifters suspected of stealing thousands of pounds worth of cosmetics and electrical items using an empty pushchair.

On each occasion captured by surveillance cameras, the woman enters the store and brazenly fills her basket with around £500 worth of items.

Caught in the act: The couple pictured are wanted for a series of shoplifting offences in Plymouth and south Devon - the pair use an empty pram to hide their stolen goods

Her male accomplice then joins her a short time later and transfers the goods into his empty pram before leaving the store.

Finally, the woman abandons the basket and walks out of the shop without making a purchase.  

The unlikely pair are being hunted by police, who believe they may be responsible for a series of high-value shoplifting offences in department stores in Plymouth and south Devon.

Officers say the crimes date back over a year - with Dingles and Boots among the shops that have been hit.

The white female suspect is thought to be in her late 30s to mid-40s, around 5ft 6in in height, with a slim build and dark hair worn in a pony tail. She also wears black and white glasses.

Wanted: On each occasion the woman fills up a basket with around £500 worth of goods - the pram-pushing man then joins her and transfers the loot into his buggy before casually strolling out of the shop

The white male suspect is believed to be between 30 and 40 years old, approximately 5ft 6in to 5ft 7in in height, and bald with a chubby build.

The pram he uses to conceal the stolen goods is dark, with orange detailing around the chair and hood. 

Police are now asking the public for help in identifying the pram-raiders - anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting the reference CR/67065/14.
