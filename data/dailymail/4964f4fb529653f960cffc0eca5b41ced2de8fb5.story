A Chicago woman who claimed she was looking for a cash machine, ended up driving onto train tracks because she was more than two times over the legal limit for alcohol when she was caught.

Maria Segura, 26, faces two counts of DUI and was cited for driving with a suspended license, driving in the wrong lane, and driving without insurance.

The incident took place in the western suburbs of the Windy city early on Monday morning.

On the wrong side of the tracks: Maria E. Segura, 26, a woman charged with two counts of DUI after caught driving her Chevy Cavalier on the Burlington Northern railroad tracks

Riverside police Chief Tom Wietzel called the incident 'mindboggling.'

Just after 4 a.m. Monday, a Riverside police officer saw Ms. Segura's vehicle stopped at a railroad with its turn signal on.

The car then made a sharp turn striking both rails, according to a police statement.

The officer called 911 to have the railroad stop any train traffic in the area and pulled the car over on the tracks.

The report said the officer 'could detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the mouth' of the driver, while her eyes were bloodshot and she had a difficult time communicating.'

Segura told police she was 'was attempting to drive to an ATM to retrieve money and that is why she was on the railroad tracks.'

Police said her blood-alcohol level was 2.5 times the legal limit might explain why she ended up stuck on the tracks around 4 a.m.

They also noted that her driver’s license was suspended, and confiscated her 1996 Chevy Cavalier.

'The fact that this driver was so intoxicated that she would drive directly on railroad tracks believing that she was still on a roadway is simply mindboggling and shows the extent of her excessive alcohol consumption,' Weitzel said in the statement.

'The drunk driving situation … has just become simply out of control. … This needs to be addressed as a social issue and not just a law enforcement concern because motorists continue to drive drunk every single day and it is at epidemic levels on weekends.'
