A student nurse who avoided prison after she told a judge of her 'extreme remorse' after she drove into and killed a father-of-two  has spent the months after his death posting comments online about how much she has been enjoying herself.

The family of Allan Wellings said it appears Sophie Gorton, 21, has felt little remorse since she drove her car into the path of the 40-year-old at a set of traffic lights in Oldham last July, leaving him with fatal injuries.

Since his death she has posted several updates on Facebook, talking about her 'great year' and  holidays she has taken in Helsinki and New York.

Sophie Gorton escaped prison after she ploughed into the path of a father-of-two in her car and killed him, and told a judge of her 'extreme remorse' - despite posting Facebook updates about her 'great year' and holidays she had enjoyed in the weeks and months after the death of Allan Wellings, 40

She told the court she was very sorry for what had happened to the school minibus driver and the judge said it was unlikely anyone could punish her as much as she would punish herself

Gorton, of Moston in Manchester, also posted snaps from a New Year's Eve party, moving into her 'nice, cosy' new home with her boyfriend and being 'super happy'. A note she posted on Christmas Day said: 'I've had a great year- thanks for being part of it'.

At a hearing at Oldham Magistrates' Court the student nurse admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was given a 12 month ban as well as 80 hours of unpaid work. 

She told the court she was very sorry for what had happened to the school minibus driver and the judge said it was unlikely anyone could punish her as much as she would punish herself.  

But after the hearing Mr Wellings' family branded the justice system 'pathetic' as they revealed Gorton had posted a number of happy updates on Facebook shortly after the crash.

Mr Wellings' widow Chelsea Gibson, 29, from Heywood, said: 'We haven't heard any remorse. She has never apologised to us face to face. How can she say she is remorseful when you look at her Facebook and she's going on about all the fantastic times she has had and 'brilliant' trips to Helsinki and New York.

'How does she think that makes me feel? We have been in bits since Allan's death and yet the magistrates are accepting that she has been remorseful when it appears she's been having a great time since he died.' 

Mr Wellings, who drove a minibus for children and the disabled, was taking his motorbike out last July and was approaching a set of green traffic lights at about 7pm when the accident took place.

Allan Wellings died in July last year after he tried to throw himself off his motorbike to avoid the car 

Gorton, who was travelling in the opposite direction in a Fiat 500 suddenly turned right into his path. Mr Wellings tried to throw himself clear of  his Honda Fireblade motorbike in an attempt to avoid the impact but suffered fatal injuries. He was taken to Royal Oldham Hospital where he later died. 

In the weeks following his death Gorton posted a number of happy pictures of herself. One photo showed a bottle of champagne at Manchester Airport with the message: 'Starting our adventure in style.' 

Mr Wellings, a father to Ryan, 18, and Alfie, 10, has been described as a man with a 'heart of gold'.

Ms Gibson said: 'He loved his work and loved the children and the children loved him back. Allan was my best friend and the perfect dad to his two sons. It has affected us all in ways I can't describe.

'Now Allan is not here his sons miss him so much and are losing out on the fun and experiences only a father can bring. I have returned to work and am trying to keep the family together. Alfie is having bereavement counselling and I am getting help at work. I have vivid dreams about him which wake me up and I can't get back to sleep. We talk about him a lot and remember the fun times we had together.' 

Ms Gibson said children at the school who used to use the minibus he drove wrote a letter saying how much they missed him and felt he was part of the family. 

Gorton appeared at Oldham Magistrates' Court where she was sentenced to unpaid work and banned from driving.

Mr Wellings' family told the court he only rode his motorbike in summer because he thought it was too dangerous in the winter months.

Gorton has posted a number of smiling snaps and happy updates in the months since the car accident

The student nurse told the court of her 'extreme remorse' but has celebrated holidays in posts on Facebook

Peter Malone, defending Gorton, said she had passed her driving test when she was 19 had almost completed a nursing degree at Edge Hill University and is due to start work at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in August.

He added: 'She is someone who has written a letter saying she is remorseful, sorry and regrets the tragic event that took place. If she could turn back the clock she would. She has been feeling and is still feeling extremely sorry for the family and she can only imagine what they are feeling at such a sad time.

'She wishes the family to know both herself and her family are feeling for them and she has lost sleep over the accident with the worry it has brought and she can only imagine what the gentleman's family are going through themselves.' 

Chelsea Gibson said Gorton has never apologised to them for killing her partner and father of two

Mr Malone said the 21-year-old was still struggling to come to terms with what had happened. 

The Facebook postings were not mentioned in court.

Justice of the Peace Alan Moss said: 'Nobody can punish Sophie Gorton probably more than she has and will punish herself continually for this. There are tragic consequences as a result of this offence, but we as magistrates have guidelines in sentencing. We view this offence as a momentary lapse, a lone case of inattention.'

After the hearing Mr Wellings older brother Brian, 48, said: 'She will be living her life as normal and will even be driving around again in 12 months time whilst Allan's poor kids have to grow up without a father. Their lives will never be the same again. 

'Allan is gone and there is nothing we can do to change that. We would like to think there is remorse from this lady but I'm not sure she feels genuine remorse.'
