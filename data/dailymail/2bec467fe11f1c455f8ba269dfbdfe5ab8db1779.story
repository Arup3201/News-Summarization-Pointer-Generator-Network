A British scuba diver was glowing with happiness when he captured these alien-like fluorescent underwater creatures on camera.

By using special underwater photographic equipment, the scuba diving snapper was able to highlight the fluorescence in marine creatures.

The bright green, red and yellow colours are enhanced with ultra violet (UV) and blue-filtered light to see the unique effect.

The fimbriated moray eel is found in the Indo-Pacific oceans at depths down to 45 meters. Alex Tyrrell, a scuba diving instructor from London, captured the images while working near the Phillipines and Thailand

When viewed under normal white light, the majority of the creatures have a muted brown and beige colour.

But when photographed with the special equipment, they transform into spectacular and colourful creatures.

Mr Tyrrell managed to find this spectacular fluo bubble coral (right) and fluo hard coral (left). The 39-year-old said: 'It is still not fully understood why certain creatures fluoresce and others do not...Maybe this is an effect they can turn on and off at will - possibly for communication.'

Images such as this one of an anemone hermit crab were enhanced with UV and blue-filtered light to see the unique effect. When viewed under normal white light, the majority of the creatures have a muted brown and beige colour

The 39-year-old said: 'It is still not fully understood why certain creatures fluoresce and others do not.

'I have even seen two identical fish side by side where one fluoresces and the other doesn't.

'Maybe this is an effect they can turn on and off at will - possibly for communication.'

The pictures show a 10 centimetre anemone hermit crab who lives in the discarded shell of a snail.

A striking vivid yellow and green eel, known as the fimbriated moray, appears to approach the camera ready to bite.

Lisa's Mantis Shrimp, also known as Spearing Mantis Shrimp, feed on fish, squid and invertebrates, and grow to a length of about 25cm

An already alien-like crustacean, about 12cm in diameter and up to 25cm in length, is hidden in its burrow.

But it looks even more out-of-this-world when glowing under fluo-lighting.

Mr Tyrrell has completed more than 100 dives using this special fluorescent camera equipment. Pictured are fluorescent hard corals shown against a dive light

Mr Tyrrell has completed more than 100 dives using this special fluorescent camera equipment.

He added: 'I started this because I was diving in the same area repeatedly and wanted to get photos of familiar subjects in a very different light.

'All images were taken in Asian Pacific tropical water that reaches a temperature of up to 28°C.

'I managed to get very close to the creatures and at one point I was only 20 centimetres away from the subject.

'The majority of the photos were taken in Dauin, Philippines, while a few were taken in Koh Tao in the Gulf of Thailand.'
