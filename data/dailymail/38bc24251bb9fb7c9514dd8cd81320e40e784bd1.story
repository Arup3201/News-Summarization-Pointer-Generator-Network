Courageous Private Roy Palmer, 23, told his mother Sophie that the 'Fritz were going to get it in the neck' in the note, penned from Ypres on Good Friday 1917

A First World War
soldier's last poignant letter to his family - sent from the trenches three
days before he was killed - is to be sold at auction.

Courageous
Private Roy Palmer, 23, told his mother Sophie that the 'Fritz were going to get it
in the neck' in the note, penned from Ypres, in Belgium, on Good Friday 1917.

Just 72 hours
later, on Easter Monday, the brave machine gunner was killed
by flying shrapnel from an exploding German shell.

Now, almost a
century later, a moving collection of sepia photographs of Private Palmer with
his mother and sister, and his last letters scribbled in pencil, are for sale.

His British War
and Victory medals are also due to be sold by auctioneers Dreweatts in Bristol
on March 6.

Writing to his 'Dearest Mother' on April 6, 1917, Private Palmer said: 'Yesterday we had a
fairly long march to this country and the heat made it rather tiring.

'My foot was bad
too, but I stuck it and didn't fall out. I think it will soon be alright.

'Tonight we are
going up the line to renew our acquaintance with Fritz and I'm sure he is going
to get it in the neck at no distant date.

'You watch the papers.

"Tis a country
this, and no mistake.

'But I suppose it will improve after we have sent the Huns
home again.

'I shall be busy
during the next week or two and may not be able to write much but keep your
heart up and do as you always do.

'I am therefore not scared at things at all.
(sic)

Just 72 hours after the letter was sent, on Easter Monday, brave machine gunner Pte Palmer was killed by flying shrapnel from an exploding German shell

Writing to his 'Dearest Mother' on April 6, 1917, Pte Palmer said: 'Yesterday we had a fairly long march to this country and the heat made it rather tiring... Tonight we are going up the line to renew our acquaintance with Fritz and I'm sure he is going to get it in the neck at no distant date'

'We have to fall
in soon, so I must close. Kindest regards to all and love to you, from your
affectionate son Roy.'

Three days later,
Private Palmer, from Bishopston, Bristol, was dead.

He was one of
thousands of Allied soldiers killed in the months before the Battle of
Passchendaele in 1917 which claimed more than 200,000 British lives.

He has no known
grave, but his name is recorded on the Menin Gate Memorial at Ypres.

The fighting was so bloody it's often said Britain's pre-war professional Army died there.

Battle
raged at Ypres in West Flanders, Belgium, for six weeks in October and November 1914, leaving 
7,960 of our troops dead, 29,562 wounded and 17,873 missing.

Most
survivors were content to say they'd been at 'First Ypres', no more 
information being necessary to explain what they endured.

A second battle was waged there in 1915.

This saw the introduction of two new forms or warfare - chlorine gas (by the Germans) and flamethrowers.

The British suffered 60,000 casualties, while the Germans lost 35,000.

The third battle, otherwise known as Passchendaele, was in 1917.

Lieutenant Hart,
Pte Palmer's company commander in the York and Lancaster Regiment, wrote to his
family and said: 'The Boche raided us on Easter Monday evening.

'Before the raid,
he bombarded us very heavily and his snipers too, were very active.

'Your son was
killed about 5.15pm on Easter Monday by a Boche shell.

'He was hit by shrapnel
in the head and died immediately.

'I arranged for
him to be buried on Tuesday, the day after his death.

'It was a hard
thing to see such a good lad cast away from any further service, but he did his
duty for King and Country bravely, and a small cross marks his resting place.'

Pte Palmer's name
was also added to his late father's gravestone at Horfield parish church in
Bristol with the words: 'Fell in action on April 9th, 1917, and was buried at
Ypres. Aged 23 years.

'He is covered
with immortal honour and joined with those that fought for England and are
dead.'

The poignant
collection of soldier memorabilia is expected to fetch £300 to £400.

Malcolm Claridge,
the auctioneers' militaria expert, said: 'Like many thousands of others,
Private Palmer was a humble, but very courageous British soldier killed at
Ypres in the lead-up to the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917.

'But the
photographs and the letters he wrote to his mother provide a very personal
insight into the bravery and stoicism British soldiers displayed as they fought
under terrible conditions in the Great War.'

Pte Palmer's British War and Victory medals are also due to be sold by auctioneers Dreweatts in Bristol on March 6
