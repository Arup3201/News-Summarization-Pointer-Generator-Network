Light aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious has obviously been working up a thirst on her latest deployment after she had to be replenished at sea alongside two Royal Fleet Auxilary ships.

The 22,000-tonne helicopter carrier was connected to RFA Fort Austin, which was transferring stores to RFA Fort Victoria, which in turn was pumping fuel to HMS Illustrious.

At the same time a helicopter was transferring stores to the carrier, affectionately known as Lusty.

The carrier is currently deployed on Cougar '13, the annual deployment of the UK Armed Forces Maritime Response Force Task Group to the Mediterranean and Gulf region.

The long-planned deployment involves four Royal Navy warships, the lead commando group from 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines and elements of naval air squadrons.

The operation also includes the the navy's flagship HMS Bulwark.

Last month HMS Illustrious was part of a Royal Navy taskforce which set sail for Gibraltar as David Cameron prepared to sue Spain over its treatment of the area.

The journey was part of a 
long-planned exercise – but government officials said the show of force 
may have helped ‘focus minds’ in Spain.

HMS Illustrious was built at Swan Hunters Ship Builders Yard on the Tyne, and subsequently commissioned in her base port of Portsmouth in 1982.

The ship is 209 metres long and weighs 22,000 tonnes.

She has 1,400 compartments and 15 lifts, and has a top speed in excess of 30 knots.

Her role ranges from maritime strikes to evacuation operations.

The ship’s motto, 'Vox Non Incerta', is based on a quote from the Bible and means 'No Uncertain Sound'. 

The
Cougar '13 deployment will see elements of the Response Task Force 
Group hone its maritime skills through exercises with a number of key 
allies.

HMS Illustrious is 
there to provide escort duties and undertake ongoing counter-piracy 
operations outside of the exercise programme.

In 2011 the Royal Navy's last fixed-wing 
aircraft carrier was converted into a helicopter carrier and is now 
capable of carrying a force of up to 20 helicopters and 600 personnel.

A previously unseen computer generated image has offered a glimpse into what the Royal Navy's two new aircraft carriers will look like.

The £5.5billion Queen Elizabeth-class warships are due to start sea trials in 2017.

The 65,000-tonne floating fortresses - HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales - are due to be fully operational from 2020 meaning they could be deployed to trouble spots around the world.
