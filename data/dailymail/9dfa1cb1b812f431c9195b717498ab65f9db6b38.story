Frank Lampard is preparing himself to leave Chelsea, even if Jose Mourinho wants to keep the midfielder.

The 35-year-old's future remains uncertain and he could end a 13-year association with the club.

If he does end up departing, Lampard insists he will have no regrets.

'I don’t know if I’ll be at Chelsea next season,' Lampard told Red magazine. 'I’d like to carry on for two or three more years but it would be good to end on a high.

'So if that means it all ends tomorrow, I wouldn’t have any regrets.'

The former West Ham midfielder will be used sparingly by Roy Hodgson at the World Cup in Brazil and realises that he is becoming surpassed by others at club level.

'You know your shelf life, so I started to mentally prepare when I hit 30,' he added.

‘I’ve been doing this for a long time, so there’s a part of me that’s looking forward to the future.

‘I feel ready to handle it, because I’ve got other things, like the books.’

Lampard made 40 appearances for Chelsea in all competitions last season, although he is no longer sure of a first-team place.

He
 has always sworn that he will never play for another club in the 
Barclays Premier League, but LA Galaxy have a long-standing interest in 
Lampard and the MLS side would offer him a contract.
