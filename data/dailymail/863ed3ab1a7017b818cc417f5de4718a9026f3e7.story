Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria has asked to leave the Champions League winners.

The Argentine winger has been linked with a move to Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain this summer.

And it appears that he could leave the Spanish capital following Real coach Carlo Ancelotti's admission that his winger has asked to move on.

Ancelotti confirmed: 'If Di Maria doesn’t find a solution for his future, we would be happy to welcome him back once the transfer market is over.

'He asked to leave, he didn’t accept the proposal for the renewal of the contract.

'He's a Real Madrid player and until August 31, as I've already said, anything can happen.

'I'm surprised to read that there seems to be some disagreement (about Di Maria) between the club and me. There's no disagreement and we both think the same.'

The Real boss also confirmed that Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Arsenal target Sami Khedira has also turned down a contract extension.

The defensive midfielder is looking to leave the club on a free transfer next summer.

He added: 'It's a different situation to Di Maria. He's not asked to go.

'He's rejected an offer to renew, but has a year of contract. We'll see what happens.'
