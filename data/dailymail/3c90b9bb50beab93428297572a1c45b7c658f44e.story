Rapid Vienna have invited fans to help demolish their Gerhard Hanappi Stadium this Saturday, offering them the chance to unscrew seats, chisel away pieces of the walls and even cut out bits of the goal net to take home.

The Austrian club are set to leave their home of 37 years and move into a new 22,000-seater stadium which is due to be completed in 2016.

Prices at the 'Demolition Party' this weekend include 19.77 euros (£15.40) - the year the stadium was built - per seat and 18.99 euros (£14.80) - the year the club was founded - for a section of net. For five euros (£3.90), you can dig up a bit of turf.

Announcing the event, the club said: 'Here you have the opportunity to stock up on memorabilia from our venerable home with four different souvenirs from the Gerhard Hanappi Stadium available to purchase.

'We have the stadium seats, a square of turf, a piece of the wall or part of the goal net for sale. For the turf, wall and net we have even prepared a special 'Rapid box' in which to pack the whole thing in a fitting container.'

But keen not to spark a free-for-all, the club added: 'We will provide the necessary tools, naturally with all safety precautions taken into account and with employees standing by.'

Fans will assist with the demolition of the 18,500-capacity ground on Saturday 

To celebrate the occasion, Rapid are also staging a fan festival at the ground and will also take a 'big family photo' of players and fans to mark the closure of the stadium.

Rapid, the most successful club in the Austrian league with 32 wins to their credit, moved into the Gerhard Hanappi Stadium in May 1977.

Hanappi played for the club between 1950 and 1965 before becoming an architect. He planned the stadium, known initially as the Weststadion, and it was named after him following his death in 1980.

The 18,500-capacity ground was renovated between 2001 and 2003 but the club have outgrown it and they will move to the Allianz Stadion in two years' time.

Rapid Vienna's fans are known for their passion and their departure from the ground will be emotional

In the meantime, they will play their home matches at the Ernst Happel Stadion, the Austrian national stadium.

Rapid are currently third in the Austrian Bundesliga, nine points behind leaders Wolfsberger.
