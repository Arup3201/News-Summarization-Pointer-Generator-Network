A delapidated house with no working toilet inside the house has unexpectedly sold for $2.17 million at auction, $570,000 over reserve price.

268 Doncaster Ave, Kensington, in Sydney's south-east, was sold to an investor on Saturday afternoon after belonging to the same family for 50 years.

'The place was very run down. To say it was in a liveable condition would be kind,' estate agent Joe Recep, of NG Farah Real Estate told Daily Mail Australia.

268 Doncaster Ave, Kensington, in Sydney's south-east, was sold to an investor on Saturday for $2.17 million

The four-bedroom house, which had peeling paint, mould in the bathroom, unkempt lawns, and renter's clothing around the yard, went under the hammer with 27 registered bidders, reported The Daily Telegraph. 

'There were four male university students renting the property and they were a bit messy, which didn't make our lives very easy,' he said.

The reserve price for the property had been set at $1.6 million, slightly lower than other houses in the area due to the smaller land size.

The deceased estate had been used as a rental property for eight years, and due to it's close proximity to the University of New South Wales, the house had already garnered significant interest prior to the auction. 

Mr Recep said that the auction had gotten off to a slow start, and they had to enter a vendor bid to prompt the bidding.

The new owner reportedly had no inspections done on the property

'At one point it looked like the property wasn't going to sell at all. Then the bids started going up by $50,000, then $20,000, then $10,000,' he said.

'Then it went to $2.17 million, to an investor who hadn't even seen the property until today.'

The new owner reportedly had no inspections done on the property.

Siblings Victor Bubba and Rosina Vaccarella grew up in the Kensington property, and said that the sale price blew them away.

'I was thinking we’d maybe get $1.8 million, but then when I saw the state of it this morning I doubted that. I never would have thought it would got for more than $2 million,' Mrs Vaccarella said.

'There was no display furniture like we normally have, and there were old lounges around the house.  The double lock-up garage is being used as a gym and there are cricket bats and surfboards around the place,' Mr Recep said. 

'But at the end of the day it's in a great location. Coogee Beach is only five minutes away, the biggest university in Australia is a few hundred metres walk, and there are plenty of good schools in the area,' he said.

'The market is very strong at the moment and it's all about supply and demand. What's expensive today will be cheap tomorrow.'
