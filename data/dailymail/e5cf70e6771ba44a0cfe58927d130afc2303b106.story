Too much pressure has been placed on the shoulders of Norwegian youngster Martin Odegaard, according to former Liverpool left-back John Arne Riise.

There has been talk in recent weeks of a big-money move for the Stromsgodset attacking midfielder, who has been on a tour of Europe's top clubs over the last month.

Odeegard has trained at Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Arsenal among others, while more top clubs have also registered interest in the 16-year-old.

Age: 15 (D.O.B. 17/12/98)

Born: Drammen, Norway

Position: Attacking midfielder

Club: Stromsgodset (2014-)

Appearances: 24

Goals: 5

International appearances: 3

International goals: 0 

And Riise, himself a former Norwegian international, admits that he feels for Odegaard after the pressure that has been put on him. 

'I feel a bit sorry for the boy,' Riise told Dagbladet. 'With anticipation the pressure rises. There is talk of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal. It makes people expect a lot. 

'But he does seem to have his feet firmly on the ground and it seems like he has a great family around him. Even so, it will be tough for him now. People are wary of him and people will look out for him.'

Odegaard turned 16 last week, and can only now sign his first professional contract. If he does decide to leave his homeland, Stromsgodset will be due a compensation package.

Odegaard was the youngest player to feature in a Euro qualifier after making his Norway debut vs Bulgaria

The promising attacking midfielder has made 25 appearances for the Norwegian side since making his debut in April and has scored five goals.

He already has three full caps for Norway having made his international bow in August.

Odegaard has been guided in negotiations by his father, Hans Erik, who was a professional footballer in the Norwegian league and is now the assistant manager at Mjondalen.
