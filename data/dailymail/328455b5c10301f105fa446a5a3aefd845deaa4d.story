Residents of Dale Farm, the UK's largest illegal travellers' site, lost their High Court battle against eviction today.

The travellers, who have vowed to lodge another appeal, said that they will stand their ground and cannot be moved until Monday at the earliest

They attempted to block their removal from the controversial site near Basildon, Essex, in three linked applications for judicial review.

The decision means officials will finally be able to evict hundreds of travellers living illegally at the site since 2005 after a legal battle estimated to have cost £18m.

However this afternoon Mr Justice Ouseley, 
sitting in London, ruled they had delayed too long in challenging 
Basildon Council's decision to take direct action against them.

He said the travellers were breaking criminal law on a daily basis by remaining on the site and their removal was necessary to avoid 'the criminal law and the planning system being brought into serious disrepute.'

The judge said: 'It is the residents of Dale Farm who have to comply with the obligation to leave voluntarily.

'If the removal becomes forcible it would be because of decisions made by the residents not to comply.'

Dismissing all the arguments, the judge observed they had been properly taken into account in many legal actions over the years.

The judge said he recognised that the removal of the travellers was going to cause 'considerable distress and disruption - but in my judgment the time has manifestly come for steps to enforce the law to be taken'.

Mr Justice Ouseley, whose ruling lasted more than three hours, said: 'The conclusion has been reached time and again that this is just the wrong site for travellers.'

The planning system had always included a 'fair consideration' of 'personal circumstances'.

He added: 'The Dale Farm residents have had that, but they have lost.'

The judge said: 'The criminal law applies equally to all - travellers and others alike.'

Dispute: The Dale Farm site has become a target for protesters who sympathise with the travellers

Candy Sheridan, vice-chair of the Gypsy Council, said: 'We are disappointed. We are not surprised but the fight goes on. We will be seeking permission to appeal.'

Another resident, Jake Fulton said outside the gates of the site that families were 'oo distraught' to speak after they lost their Hbattle.

'People are already flooding back, both travellers and supporters,' Mr Fulton told reporters.

'We are expecting a big swell over the next couple of days and we'll be ready for when they come.'

He added: 'Of course we are going to try and appeal this decision but we don't know what's going to happen there.

'At the end of the day we will be here for them and we'll have to rely on the physical defences now that the legal ones have failed us.'

Basildon Council has been fighting to remove the travellers since 2005, but a judge gave them a stay of execution last week.

The residents triumphantly declared they would be still be living there in 30 years.

The 86 families who face eviction argued that they should not be removed because the land they bought in 2001 was being used as a scrapyard.

Their lawyers had argued the council's decision earlier this year to take direct action to clear the land was in breach of their human rights and unreasonable.

Or will you? The travellers now face removal by bailiffs if they refuse to leave the land

They also argued there had been a failure to offer residents suitable alternative accommodation and to take account of vulnerable residents, including the sick in need of regular medication and children whose schooling would be disrupted if families were evicted.

Basildon Council said only a small part of the farm was being used as a scrapyard and it has always hoped to return it to green-belt status.

Pleased: Basildon Council Leader Tony Ball arrives at the High Court yesterday, and said after the verdict that he took 'quiet satisfaction' from it

Some critics have condemned the court battle as a 'farce', which could cost in the region of £18million.

One of the applications has been brought by Mary Sheridan, who claims being evicted would be a breach of her human rights.

Although Basildon Council has said the travellers can apply for accommodation, her barrister Marc Willers argued that it had an ‘obligation to facilitate the gipsy way of life’.

Mr Willers said the case had an 'extensive history' but Ms Sheridan was not claiming she should be allowed to stay at Dale Farm 'forever - or indeed for many years, or even a year'.

Basildon Council's leader Tony Ball said tonight: 'This is not a day for triumphalism, but I do take quiet satisfaction on behalf of local people that in all matters the council has been found to have acted lawfully.

'The residents of the illegal settlement at Dale Farm have now had their day in court. For almost three weeks every aspect of the council's decision to clear Dale Farm has been scrutinised in great detail and our position has been upheld.

'As for the travellers - having engaged with the legal system they must now abide by the law.

'I would like to reflect on what the judge said that the criminal law applies equally to all, travellers and others alike. They have reached the end of the road. I would therefore urge them to do two things.

'Firstly I would ask them to see that their supporters stand down and preferably leave the site. If they have the travellers' best interests at heart they will do this. There is now nothing to be gained by their continued resistance and certainly not if it involves violence and other forms of law breaking as some have suggested.

'Secondly I hope the travellers will now comply with the court's ruling and leave Dale Farm in a peaceful and orderly manner.

'I strongly urge the travellers not to return to the path of unlawful resistance.

'It is too early yet to say exactly when the site clearance will begin. That will be a decision for the officers and our partners, such as the police, and will primarily depend upon how quickly all the necessary resources can be put back in place so it can be done safely.'
