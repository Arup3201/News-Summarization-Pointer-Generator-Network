Dozens of high school students in San Diego could face criminal charges after texting sexually explicit photos of teenage girls.

Schoolgirls, some as young as 13, had sent naked pictures of themselves to their boyfriends, which were then circulated to students at seven schools.

Some of the students who received and sent on the photos could now be charged with possession  and distribution of child pornography.

Investigation: Schoolboys at seven San Diego schools could be charged with child pornography after sharing pictures of naked girlfriends

'The individuals took pictures of 
themselves in very compromising positions, exposing various parts of 
their bodies, and very, you know, unflattering,' Lieutenant Chuck Haye of the San Diego Police Department said.

He told 10 News about 30 students at six high schools and one middle school were involved and that many of the girls had no idea their pictures were being distributed.

'We have several hundred photographs to 
look through. We have a much smaller number of pictures that actually 
have a face shot that will provide us an opportunity to identify who it 
is,' Lieutenant Haye added.

The San Dieguito Union High School District told ABC News it was cooperating with the investigation and that it encouraged parents 'to consistently monitor teen-use of cellular phone and other technologies'.

Parents in the school district have also said the case has prompted them to think about the way their children use phones.

Gordon Cooke, whose 14-year-old daughter attends Canyon Crest Academy, one of the schools allegedly being investigated, said: 'What I tell my kids all the time is you’re really just one screen shot away from ruining your lives.'

'I think a lot of the kids don't realize and they think it's funny and innocent,' he said.

San Diego police plan to file criminal charges but have not said when that will happen. All of those being investigated are minors.
