Art-lovers will be able to see two of the most recognisable and much-loved paintings in the world at a museum in London for the first time in 65 years.

The National Gallery will reunite two of Vincent van Gogh's iconic ‘Sunflower’ paintings next year, allowing visitors the chance to compare and contrast these much-loved masterpieces side-by-side.

The historical exhibition, which will also showcase new research about the way the artist worked, was made possible thanks to a deal with the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.

Two versions of Vincent van Gogh’s iconic 'Sunflowers' are being reunited in London for the first time in 65 years in 2014

The paintings are two of the five versions of ‘Sunflowers’ that are now spread around the world, with the others currently residing in Tokyo, Munich and Philadelphia.

They are worth an estimated £100m each and were last exhibited in London together 65 years ago.

The series dates from 1888, when Van Gogh left Paris to paint in the brilliant sunshine of the South of France, inviting Paul Gauguin to join him.

Waiting for Gauguin to arrive, Van Gogh painted a series of pictures of sunflowers to decorate his friend’s bedroom. They were meant as a sign of friendship and welcome, but also of Vincent's allegiance to Gauguin as his artistic leader.

Vincent wrote to his brother Theo in August 1888: 'I am hard at it, painting with the enthusiasm of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when you know that what I’m at is the painting of some sunflowers.

'If I carry out this idea there will be a dozen panels. So the whole thing will be a symphony in blue and yellow.

'I am working at it every morning from sunrise on, for the flowers fade so quickly. I am now on the fourth picture of sunflowers.

'This fourth one is a bunch of 14 flowers... it gives a singular effect.'

The pair worked together throughout autumn 1888 – but it ended very badly at the close of the year when Van Gogh seemed to have a nervous breakdown, famously cut off part of his ear and entered an asylum.

National Gallery Director, Dr Nicholas Penny, said: 'This exhibition is designed to help those for whom the paintings by Van Gogh are compelling images to understand how they were made – and made again – and out of what materials.

'It will deepen every visitor’s appreciation of the artist. We are very grateful to the Van Gogh Museum for making this possible.'
