A Cambridge University student died after being dragged for nearly a kilometre under a double-decker bus - and even stopped to pick up passengers with her lifeless body underneath.

Mingwei Tan, 20, suffered massive injuries after being hit by a N5 night bus in Hampstead, northwest London, driven by 52-year-old Shahriar Firouzian.

But Firouzian was oblivious to the tragedy and only found out about the tragedy when he arrived for work the next day, and 
told police he thought he had hit a fox.

The medical student's body was found 
lying in the road in Haverstock Hill after the crash, around 825m from 
where her shoe came off in Pond Street when first hit by the bus.

Iranian-born Firouzian, who has worked for bus firm Metroline since 2003, is standing trial accused of causing Ms Tan's death by careless driving.

Hamish Reid, prosecuting, told a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court Firouzian should have spotted Ms Tan when he turned sharply into Pond Street from Hampstead Road.

'He should have anticipated that pedestrians might be present in the road in front of him', he said.

'Essentially by failing to ensure that he had a clear view in front of him, he fell below the standard to be expected by a competent and careful driver and was driving without due care and attention.Â 

'It is by this failure on his part that he collided with Ms Tan and this caused her death.'

Ms Tan, a medical student at Peterhouse College, Cambridge, and president of the university's karate club, had returned from a holiday with friends to Cyprus late on September 29, 2010.

Friends at university have described her as joyful, talented and enthusiastic.

She took the N24 bus from Victoria 
Station to Hampstead to pick up luggage from a family friend's house 
where she was staying, planning to head off on another trip to Rome 
later that day.

But the third year student was knocked down and died shortly after getting off the N24, at around 1.45am.

The court was shown CCTV footage from both the N24 and Firouzian's bus in the moments before Ms Tan was hit.

Mr
Reid said: 'Ms Tan is seen walking up Hampstead Road towards the 
junction with Pond Street, and she crosses Pond Street from the south to
the north on the west side of the junction.

'This
is at the time when Mr Firouzian is turning right into Pond Street, 
therefore she is crossing the road directly in front of him.

'He totally fails to see her.

'She is caught by the bus and dragged underneath it towards the offside.'

Firouzian stops to pick up a passenger
in Pond Street and then carries on driving up the road, unaware of 
having hit a pedestrian.

Mr Reid said: 'All this while, Ms Tan is underneath the bus.

'Her
body only comes free from the underside of the bus just south of the 
junction with Belsize Grove, 825m after the point of the original 
collision.'

Passers-by soon spotted her body lying in the road and called for help, but she was declared dead at the scene.

Firouzian finished his shift and only realised what had happened when he showed up for work the next day, the court was told.

He was immediately suspended and later arrested and charged.

In a statement to police, he said he thought he may have hit a fox that night near Belsize Park tube station.

Mr Reid said Firouzian was not breath tested after the crash, but is not suspected of being unfit to drive, on his phone, or under the influence of drink or drugs when the crash happened.

However, he suggested Firouzian may have been looking to his right rather than straight ahead at the exact moment of hitting Ms Tan.

Firouzian, of Harrow Way, Watford, Hertfordshire, denies causing death by careless driving.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
