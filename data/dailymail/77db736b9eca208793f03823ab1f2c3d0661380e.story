A six months pregnant woman from Pennsylvania faces up to five years in jail for allegedly hiding 89 packets of heroin inside a 'body cavity'.

The North Jersey Record reports that retail worker Marina McCarthy, 22, of Gouldsboro, was secretly filmed on Friday afternoon reaching into her pants as she sat in the back of a police SUV.

She had apparently been stopped while traveling with her 27-year-old mechanic boyfriend, Dakota Dunning, because the car he was driving had a temporary registration plate that was not visible.

Officers reportedly then found that the vehicle was unregistered and uninsured and that Dunning and McCarthy both had warrants out for their arrests relating to previous incidents.

Captain Jonathan Miller told the North Jersey Record that troopers got increasingly suspicious that there were drugs on the scene as they spotted 'fresh needle track marks' on Dunning.

A K-9 dog also detected an illegal  substance, according to the report.

Dunning and McCarthy were arrested and taken to Glen Rock Police Department in New Jersey for further questioning.

It was only when a detective reviewed CCTV footage from earlier in the day that they allegedly spotted McCarthy stuffing packages down her pants.

She had been handcuffed in the front of her body, because of her pregnancy, so she was able to access the zipper area of her pants.

A female police officer was purportedly sent to guard McCarthy while she retrieved the bags of heroin from her body in the bathroom.

A witness told Daily Mail Online the packages of powder had been tightly packed together and collectively, were no bigger than a piece of Laffy Taffy candy.

McCarthy was checked out by a local medic but refused to go to  hospital, Captain Jonathan Miller said.

After being charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance, she was released pending a court appearance on March 17.

She paid $1,000 in bail for her previous arrest warrant with a check.

Dunning received motor-vehicle summonses and was released, also with a March 17 court appointment.

He was released with a new court date for his prior warrant and his car was impounded.
