People with conservative views are more content than their more liberal-minded neighbours, research suggests.

Those with politics that lean to the Right were found to have higher levels of well-being – even when their favoured political party was in opposition.

They benefit from the belief that problems are a person’s own making – which helps them deal better with whatever life throws at them.

Right frame of mind: Those with politics that lean to the Right were found to have higher levels of well-being, according to U.S. researchers

The findings come from a U.S. study that examined data involving more than a million people from 16 European countries, including the UK.

Analysis of information such as political beliefs and welfare spending showed that people living in more liberal countries had higher average well-being than those ruled by the Right.

But individuals with conservative politics were more satisfied with their lot wherever they were.

Adam Okulicz-Kozaryn, of Rutgers University in New Jersey: ‘These findings lead us to believe that conservatives living in liberal countries are most likely to report the highest well-being.’

Writing in the Journal of Applied Psychology, he said Left-wing policies on welfare, pensions and jobs can make a country happier overall.

‘Liberal governments tend to do more to shield citizens against certain hardships, such as unemployment and poverty, which can make people happier,’ he added.
