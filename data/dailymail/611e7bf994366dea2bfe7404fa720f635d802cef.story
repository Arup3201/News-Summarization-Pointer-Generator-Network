Alan Pardew's return to Crystal Palace to manage the side he enjoyed a successful spell with as a player continues to be met with adulation by the club's supporters.

As the former Newcastle boss headed to his local Co-op in Warlingham, Surrey, he was happy enough to pose for a photograph with a fan on Friday evening.

Pardew is preparing for his first Premier League game in charge of the Eagles against in-form Tottenham in Saturday's late kick-off at Selhurst Park.

Pardew salutes fans at full-time after his Palace side beat Dover 4-0 in the FA Cup last weekend

Pardew led Palace to a 4-0 victory in his opening match against Dover in the FA Cup third round last Sunday, but his attention will now be on steering the club out of the Premier League relegation zone.

But his new side are without a win in eight league games  and will not be encouraged to know that visitors Tottenham have only lost two away matches in the division this season - against Manchester City and Chelsea.

But should Pardew inspire the side to a win against their London rivals and inject some fresh impetus into Palace's stagnant league form, he can expect to be asked to stop for many more photographs by the Palace faithful.

Pardew will look to take Palace out of the Premier League's relegation zone but his side have not won in eight
