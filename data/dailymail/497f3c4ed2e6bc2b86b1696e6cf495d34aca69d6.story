This terrifying video reveals what it’s like to be stalked – and attacked – by a large great white shark.

The two-minute clip – which is sure to make some holidaymakers afraid to venture into the water – shows the behemoth pursuing a camera as it is towed behind a boat off the coast of South Africa, a popular destination for tourists who are keen to see one of nature's most feared predators.

Later, once the boat has come to a full stop, the curious shark bares its razor-sharp teeth and takes a bite out of the camera.

The feared man-eater leaves a large scratch on the tow camera’s lens and moves on after realising it isn’t part of its food chain.

The amazing close-quarters footage of the 13-ft shark was captured using a remote camera towed behind Charles Maxwell’s boat.

Mr Maxwell’s video also provides a stunning look at friendlier marine life, including a pod of dolphins and a group of seals swimming behind the boat.
