When a child wakes up in the middle of the night, mothers will think of everything to try and get their young one calmly back to sleep - including a softly sung lullaby. 

Many will chose a rendition of Rock-a-bye-Baby, but Kimberly Henderson of Sumter, South Carolina, has proven that her choice of tune may be more effective. 

She was recorded singing Sam Smith's version of the Whitney Houston track How Will I Know to her one-year-old daughter, Vaida.

The child had woken up during the middle of the night, so Mrs Henderson walked into the kitchen of the family home and cleared her lungs.

Her sister then uploaded the video YouTube and Facebook, leading to almost five million views.

The mother told ABC News: 'I woke up this morning and I was just in awe.

'I don't even know where to start. I uploaded it to Facebook and everybody just started sharing the c*** out of it. And then the radio station in Seattle uploaded it and it's gotten like 4 million views.'

She explained that she didn't think the footage was very good and was wary of uploading it because she looked 'awful'.
