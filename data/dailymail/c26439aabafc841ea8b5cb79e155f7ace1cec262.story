Andres Iniesta scored once and provided two assists to help Barcelona romp to a 4-0 rout of third-tier Huesca in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.

Ivan Rakitic opened the scoring for Barcelona in the 12th minute when he struck a free kick into the top left corner beyond Huesca goalkeeper Daniel Jimenez's reach.

Iniesta, who returned from an injury sustained in his team's 3-1 loss at Real Madrid on Oct. 25, netted four minutes later after he latched onto Rakitic's pass.
