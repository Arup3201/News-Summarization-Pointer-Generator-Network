A grieving father has told how he texted his fiancee to say stay safe and watch out for the storm which just moments later destroyed their home killing her and their four month-old baby.

Kimberley Hilliard, 35, and baby girl Paris died when their home was destroyed by a tornado which ripped through the small town of Smithfield in Madison County, last week.

Miss Hilliard texted fiance Bobby Newman half an hour before the storm hit to say it was getting dark outside and that there was no power so she and Paris were going to take a nap.

He told 
Syracuse.com: 'I could tell something terrible had happened and I right 
away started calling Kim. I called probably five or six times in a row, 
but there was no answer. I knew it wasn't good.'

'People
 tell me I seem like I'm being really strong, but actually it just 
hasn't sunk in yet,'' he said. "I'm still in shock. I still just can't 
believe it."

The freak storm
 saw gusts of up to 135mph flatten homes and uproot trees as it ripped 
through parts of Central New York on Tuesday evening last week.

Another
 Smithfield resident 53-year-old Arnie Allen also died after his house 
was picked up and hurled up to 200 yards through the air.

Mr
 Newman's othe daugher, Brooke, 3, was at home with his mother when the 
storm hit. Miss Hilliard's other daughter Ariana, 11, was staying with 
her grandparents.

The couple were planning to to marry in 2016. Their new home being built on the hillside next to where Hilliard had lived.

Mr
 Newman said he had warning's about the tornado on the radio but hadn't 
taken them seriously as he had never heard of a tornado hitting the area
 before.

He  added: 'Paris was just the happiest, most wicked beautiful 
baby,'' he said. "She was long and chunky, and always smiling.'
