Millionaire chef Rick Stein is branching out - to Winchester in Hampshire.

The TV star has just announced plans to open his first restaurant outside of Cornwall.

67-year-old Stein is behind so many popular, tourist-friendly seafood eateries in Padstow, Cornwall, that the sleepy fishing village has since been affectionately dubbed 'Padstein.'

The millionaire chef will be expanding his food empire to Winchester, Hampshire with a new restaurant

In Padstow, Cornwall, The Seafood Restaurant remains a local staple, serving fresh fish dishes everyday

His first Winchester offering, to be called 'Rick Stein,' is scheduled to open its doors in October.

'Our new restaurant will be about fresh fish, simply cooked,' Stein said.

'This is a big and exciting move for us, our first outside Cornwall, and we can't wait to bring our passion for seafood to Winchester.'

'I love Winchester,' he added. 'It's steeped in heritage, with beautiful architecture and seems to have a love of great food.'

'We have secured a high street position and the restaurant will seat 70 for lunch and dinner.'

While Stein and his team will be recruiting some staff from the local area, the new restaurant will remain a family affair with his middle son, Jack, overseeing the menu development and kitchen as executive chef.

Stein owns an empire that includes restaurants, hotels, cook books and even a cooking school in Cornwall

The new restaurant will feature classic dishes, such as turbot hollandaise, slip sole meunière and grilled lobster, as well as some dishes inspired by Stein's world travels. 

Eldest son, Edward, will also be involved with the renovation of the restaurant's interiors, while youngest son, Charles, will be supplying some of the wines for the eatery.

Stein's business partner and former wife, Jill, said: 'The interior design of our Winchester restaurant will be understated with an urban feel and a subtle nod to our coastal roots.'

Rick Stein's Cafe has helped to boost the Padstow economy with over 500 locals working for the TV chef

Rick and Jill Stein opened their flagship seafood restaurant in 1975 in Padstow and since then their multi-million pound business has grown to include five restaurants, accommodation, stores, and a cookery school.

The Oxfordshire-born chef has also appeared on several television programmes, such as Rick Stein's Taste of the Sea, and released many cooking and recipe books over the years.

His food empire is now worth at least £32 million and has had a significant positive impact on the local economy, employing nearly 500 people in Padstow alone.

The Seafood Restaurant is a more pricey affair, while Stein's Fish & Chips offers more affordable takeaway

Hampshire is, unsurprisingly, very excited about the anticipated Rick Stein-fuelled tourist boom.

The County Council's Executive Member for Economy, Transport and Environment, Seán Woodward, said: 'It's fantastic to hear that Rick Stein has chosen Winchester as the location for his new restaurant.'

'The Rick Stein restaurant will be a really welcome addition to this, attracting people from far and wide to the city and wider Hampshire county.'
