As Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran appear to move closer to the point of no return, Australia's big names have inundated the Indonesian president with powerful pleas for him to show mercy. 

Hollywood star Guy Pearce and ARIA-award winners The Temper Trap have joined a growing chorus of Australians pleading for Indonesian President Joko Widodo to show mercy to the reformed drug couriers, who are facing death by firing squad. 

Pearce - of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert fame - took to Twitter to pen his message to the nation's leader. 'President Widodo, you look like a compassionate man,' he wrote. 

'Please don't let pride stand in the way of your mercy brother'.

Standing by his decision: Indonesian President Joko Widodo is forging ahead with the imminent executions

Pearce is among a swelling number of big names who have pleaded with the Indonesian government for mercy. 

Chan and Sukumaran were transferred to Nusakambangan, known as 'Death Island', by Indonesian authorities on Wednesday. They are slated to be executed at an unspecified future date.

Indonesian-born Temper Trap vocalist Dougy Mandagi penned a lengthy message to the president, writing: 'we implore you, once it is done it can never be undone. Don't let this be your legacy'.

'Today my heart breaks for humanity,' Mandagi wrote. 

'On one hand we have accomplished and advanced so much through science and the rapid growth of technology but on the other hand we are still crippled with injustice!

He continued: 'As I read the news of the transfer of my friend Andrew Chan to the island where he will be executed, this feeling has never hit closer to home. I am totally in shock at the outcome of all this. I really thought that things would be different.'

Dougy Mandagi, the Australian Temper Trap vocalist who is of Indonesian background, wrote a powerful plea addressed to the Indonesian president Joko Widodo

'Today my heart breaks for humanity. On one hand we have accomplished and advanced so much through science and the rapid growth of technology but on the other hand we are still crippled with injustice! 

'As I read the news of the transfer of my friend Andrew Chan to the island where he will be executed, this feeling has never hit closer to home. I am totally in shock at the outcome of all this. I really thought that things would be different. 

'Right now my thoughts and prayers go out to both Andrew and Myu and their families and loved ones. 

'Being Australian of Indonesian background, I am absolutely ashamed at the Indonesian president's persistence on state sanctioned murder for the purpose of winning a popularity contest nonetheless. 

'It worries me greatly that this is the man the Indonesian people have chosen to lead them into a better future. The world needs leaders with strength and compassion and Jokowi has so far shown the world that he is severely lacking in the latter.

'Please Mr. President, we implore you. Once it is done it can never be undone. Don't let this be your legacy.'

'It's a sad sad day for humanity when we murder the good simply because they are in the way. We, the Temper Trap, want to make our position clear on this. 

'We are against the death penalty and we stand for mercy and justice! 

'If you are with us, make your voices heard! Sign the petition and spread the word!'

Celebrity backers of the Mercy Campaign, which is formally lobbying against the Australians' execution, include Missy Higgins, actress Claudia Karvan, talkback radio host Alan Jones.

Comedian Wil Anderson tweeted his support to the campaign earlier this week. 

'I've tried hard to find the right words to express everything I feel, but it's just too sad tonight. So I'll just say this #IStandForMercy.' 

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has raised the prospect of a prisoner-swap with her Indonesian counterpart in a last-ditch attempt for a political solution. 

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten were among 40 MPs to attend a candlelit vigil for the pair on Thursday morning in Canberra. Mr Abbott has requested a call with Mr Widodo.
