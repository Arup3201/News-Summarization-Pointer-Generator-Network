The grieving family of a Turkish prosecutor who died after being shot in the head and chest during courthouse siege wept over his coffin at his funeral today.

Thousands of people gathered on the streets of Istanbul to pay their respects to Mehmet Selim Kiraz, who died yesterday after the six-hour stand-off.

His coffin was covered with the Turkish flag for his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul.

Mr Kiraz died in hospital after the members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office and took him hostage. It is not known who fired the fatal shots.

Threat: The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front published disturbing photographs of the terrified prosecutor with a gun to his head on their official Facebook page before he was shot

Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grive over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation

Mourning: The coffin of the prosecutor was passed through the crowds of mourners gathered to pay their respects. He had been leading an investigation into the death of teenager Berkin Elvan, who died aged 15

Two of his captors were killed after security forces took back the building where the far-left group were holding him.

Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off.

Turkish authorities on Wednesday detained 22 suspected members of the group in the southern city of Antalya after receiving a tip-off they were planning further attacks, the Dogan news agency reported.

Meanwhile hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors and staff stood in respect on every floor of the giant Istanbul Caglayan Palace of Justice where Kiraz worked and the hostage drama unfolded.

'We will not forget you, our martyr,' read a gigantic banner, as a huge Turkish flag was hung from the top floor. The courthouse is to be renamed after Kiraz.

Mr Kiraz was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. 

The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. 

After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-Left.

Police chief Selami Altınok said officers stormed the building on Tuesday after hearing gunshots, and killed two of the gunmen.

'We carried out the negotiation for six hours. But our security forces launched the operation after gunshots were heard while terrorists were speaking on the phone during the negotiation,' he said. 

The emergency began at 2.36pm local time (12.36 GMT) when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office of Mr Kiraz.

Images of a masked militant holding a gun to Mr Kiraz's head were then posted on the group's Facebook page, along with a demand for police to confess on live TV within the hour. 

Armed police rushed to the scene and were shown escorting court officials out of the building, but there was no sign of Mr Kiraz before the deadline arrived and live TV feeds were cut.

Shots were then heard from inside the building, according to the Dogan news agency.

Protesters: Turkish police use water cannons to disperse protesters who expressed support for an alleged militant member of the banned leftist group DHKP-C group who took Turkish Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage

In a statement published by Turkish media, the hostage taking was claimed by the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, which has been behind a string of recent attacks.

The group published pictures showing one of the militants - his face concealed by a scarf with the group's red and yellow insignia - holding a gun to Kiraz's head.

They had also plastered their flags and posters on the walls of his office.

Turkish media said that the group had given a deadline of 3:36 pm (13.36 BST) for the prosecutor to identify the police officers who they say were behind the killing of Elvan or he would be shot.

In a brief video message on a widely-followed Twitter account describing itself as that of Elvan's family, his father appeared to call on the group not to harm the prosecutor.

'We want justice. We don't want anyone to shed even a drop of blood. We don't want other mothers to cry,' Sami Elvan said.

Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the current and former interior and justice ministers at the ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara to discuss the hostage taking, officials in his office said. 

The DHKP-C said on its website it wanted the police officer it blames for Elvan's death to 'confess' on television, the officers involved to be tried in 'people's courts', and charges against those who attended protests for Elvan to be dropped. 

The DHKP-C blames the ruling AK Party for the killing of teenager Elvan.

Moving in: Armed police massed outside the Istanbul courthouse

Rushed to safety: Court officials were seen being escorted to safety by armed police

Gunshots: According to the Dogan news agency, gunshots were heard from inside the building after the militant group's deadline passed

Demands: The group were demanding that Mr Kiraz name the policemen implicated in Mr Elvan's death, which has become a rallying point for the country's far-left

He was aged 15 at the time of his death, which was followed by mass nationwide protests that were also largely put down by the police.

Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death.

The United States, European Union and Turkey list the DHKP-C as a terrorist organisation. It was behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in 2013. 

In 2001, two policemen and an Australian tourist died in a DHKP-C attack in central Istanbul.

Strength of feeling: Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death
