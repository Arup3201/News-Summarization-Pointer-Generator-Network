Dozens of Muslim protestors gathered to demand that businesses stop selling alcohol in a popular East London area yesterday.

The group, led by former Al-Muhajiroun leader Anjem Choudary, warned restaurants and shops in the Brick Lane area that they face 40 lashes if they continue to sell the product, which is banned under Sharia Law.

Around 60 men and women in burkhas 
handed over warning letters to Muslim-owned businesses in the area after
 the protest was initially delayed by a small number of English Defence 
League members staging a counter-protest.

Controversial cleric Choudary was at the forefront of the protest. The Al-Muhajiroun group he formerly led has been banned under terrorism laws.

Organisers told The Times the protest was held yesterday to coincide with the large number of office workers who would be in the area for Christmas parties.

Choudary told the crowd: ‘The shops are run by Muslims and they know they are selling alcohol and they know the sale and consumption of alcohol is completely prohibited.

‘We cannot live among the non-Muslims and see this evil take place.’

He told those gathered it was his wish that Sharia law, banning alcohol, should be enforced in Britain.

He also defended three ‘fantastic’ men who were jailed last week for attacking drinkers while on a ‘Muslim patrol’.

He was referring to an incident in which Jordan Horner and another Islamic extremist told a couple they could not hold hands while walking down the street, because it was in a 'Muslim area'.

The radicals also attacked a group of men drinking in the road, and told a woman she would face 'hell fire' because of the way she was dressed.

Horner, 19, Ricardo MacFarlane, 36, and a 23-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons were sentenced to 68 weeks, 12 months and 24 weeks in prison respectively.

Groups associated with Choudary were last month labelled the ‘single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history’.

The
 radical Islamist has been identified as the link between groups who 
encourage the safe passage of British and European Muslims into Syria 
where they join Al Qaeda-linked forces.

According
 to a study by Hope Not Hate, organisations affiliated with Choudary 
have encouraged in the region of 80 young British Muslims to join the 
fighting in Syria.

They may also have had a hand in the recruitment of 300 more on the continent, the report said.

As
 well as highlighting Choudary role in encouraging young Muslims to 
fight in Syria, the report also established a connection between the 
preacher's al-Muhajiroun network and high profile terrorists, including 
those responsible for the 7/7 London bombings.

The
 report recommended that Mr Choudary should be considered a 'serious 
player' in the promotion and recruitment of young Muslims to terrorist 
cells.

Sharia Law is derived from the Koran, the example of the prophet, Muhammad, and fatwas – or the rulings of Islamic scholars.

It informs every aspect of the life of a Muslim, going far beyond the power of Western laws.

The laws tell Muslims how to lead every aspect of their lives according to God’s rules.

As well as banning alcohol, Sharia Law also outlaws meat which is not prepared in the appropriate way.

A complex legal system, it clashes with British law in several respects. For instance, Sharia Law and British law have differing definitions of what constitutes marriage and how it can be ended.

An East London Mosque spokesman and politicians in the area condemned the protest as a publicity stunt

Dr Usama Hasan, of the anti-extremist
 think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, told the East London Advertiser: 
‘In Islamic teaching you shouldn't drink alcohol, but you can't impose 
Islamic law on other people.

‘This
 is a democracy. To try and impose Sharia by force, which is their 
stated aim, is completely stupid and against Islamic teaching.’

An
 East London Mosque spokesman reportedly condemned the protest as a 
publicity stunt and politicians in the area described it as 
‘provocative’.

Labour 
group leader Sirajul Islam said before the protest: ‘Everyone has a 
right to peaceful protest but I urge the Shariah Project to think 
carefully about the impact their actions will have.’
