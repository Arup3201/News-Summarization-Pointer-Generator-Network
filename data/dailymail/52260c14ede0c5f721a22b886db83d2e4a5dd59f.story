The Canadian killer who horrifically murdered and dismembered a Chinese student in Montreal planned the attack for six months and then worked to cover up the crime, prosecutors said Wednesday in closing arguments.

Authorities worked to refute claims by Luka Magnotta's defense lawyer that he is mentally ill and not criminally responsible for the May 2012 murder of Jun Lin, 33.

In a December 2011 email to a British journalist , Magnotta had boasted about killing another person and filming it. Prosecutors argued that this shows he was planning the crime for at least six months prior to carrying it out.

Magnotta appeared in front of jurors heavyset, with a mustache and close-cropped hair, cutting a starkly different from the slender gay escort who was arrested in Berlin after going on the run two and a half years ago.

The 32-year-old has admitted to killing engineering
student Jun Lin, 33, defiling the corpse, videotaping the acts and mailing parts of the body to elementary schools and
political parties in Canada's capital.

On Wednesday, Magnotta's lawyer had argued his client has a
long medical history of schizophrenia and should not be held criminally accountable for his actions.

But in his closing argument, prosecutor Louis Bouthillier
said Lin, who had no family in Montreal and no known connection
to Magnotta, may have been the 'perfect victim' for Magnotta, a
gay escort who, in a December 2011 email to a British
journalist, had boasted about killing a human and filming the
act.

'In this email he said he was going to make a movie with a
human,' Bouthillier told the jury in French and in English.
'First degree murder is a planned and deliberate murder. It's
right there on this piece of paper.'

Jun Lin was horrifically slaughtered by Magnotta in May 2012

Diran Lin, Jun Lin's father, has pleaded in court that certain horrific evidence about his son's death not be shown to jurors and never be released to the public

Bouthillier pointed to surveillance footage from Magnotta's
gritty Montreal apartment building that showed him discarding
bags full of bloodied items during 16 trips to the garbage room
over a 48-hour period after Lin's death in May 2012.

Describing him as 'ultra-organized,' Bouthillier questioned
why Magnotta would change his phone, dispose of his camera and
his laptop after Lin's death and discard the victim's torso
inside a locked suitcase.

'Is this consistent from someone who doesn't know right from
wrong?' he asked. 'Mr. Magnotta, supposedly psychotic,
supposedly doesn't know from right and wrong, looks pretty
purposeful, pretty organized.'

After the killing, Magnotta sent body parts to two
elementary schools in Vancouver and to two political parties in
Ottawa, wrapping the hands and feet in pink tissue paper and
including poems and notes.

He then fled to Europe and was the subject of an
international manhunt. He was arrested in a Berlin Internet
cafe, where he was reading about himself.

If Magnotta is found not criminally responsible, he faces an
indefinite sentence in a mental institution. If he is convicted,
he would get an automatic life sentence with no possibility of
parole for 25 years.
