Amazing pictures show life in Sydney in the 19th century which tell the extraordinary story of Chinese immigrants and the lives of Australian women in the late 1800s.

From upper class ladies to tea room waitresses and young women of 'mixed race' integrating into society at a time when there was strong anti-Chinese sentiment, the photographs were taken at a time when Sydney was a 'rough man's town', the opium trade was flourishing.

The pictures follow the story of an extraordinary man who became a much loved and respected figure on the Sydney scene, despite his humble beginnings starting out as a nine-year-old immigrant with his uncle transporting a shipload of Chinese coolies as labour to the goldfields at Braidwood in the NSW Southern Tablelands.

Tea room revolution: Before Chinese immigrants and entrepreneur Quong Tart, pictured, above in 1891 outside his luncheon grill room at 777 George Street, Sydney, opened tea rooms and eateries Australian women had nowehre to go and socialise because no respectable woman could go into a hotel and Sydney was 'a real man's town'

Man's town: Sydney in the 1880s was a town of pubs, oyster saloons and chophouses, with not much on offer for women. This changed with the opening of the refined tearooms owned by eccentric Chinese immigrant Quong Tart, which allowed women of all classes like these suffragettes in 1892 to meet and congregate

First visit to Sydney: This was the first visit by Chinese ambassadors to Australia and shows Generals Ho and Tsing (pictured with an unidentified Chinese man) at a time when Chinese people were regarded as 'not white' historian Dr Nicola Teffer says. Because of his efforts in integrating into Australian society and making  asuccess of himself, Quong Tart was visited by Ho and Tsing and awarded the honour of Fifth-class Mandarin for valuable services rendered on behalf of his countrymen

Mei Quong Tart, whose great grandson is Syndey actor Josh Quong Tart, transformed himself into an 'English gentleman'  who transformed Sydney in the 19th century in a way which liberated Australian women to mix and circulate among different classes.

Josh Quong Tart told MailOnline the photographs showed a forgotten life in colonial Sydney, which his legendary ancestor helped transform.

'He was an amazing character,' said Josh Quong Tart, who is currently playing in The Lion King in Sydney's Capitol Theatre. 'He became the quintessential gentleman who loved everything Scottish from his early days around the Australian goldfields and who yet had all the Chinese accolades such as [the ancient Chinese honour] by the Dragon throne of the Peacock Feather.

'My father, Ian Tart, told me stories about him and when I was about 12, I decided to change my last name to Quong Tart to honour his memory.'

Historian and curator of the exhibitions, Dr Nicola Teffer, said Sydney In the 1880s was 'a cowboy town of pubs, oyster saloons and chophouses, a rough place with not much on offer for women. This changed with the opening of the refined tearooms owned by Chinese immigrant Quong Tart'.

Quong Tart's tearooms in King street and the onetime Sydney Royal arcades 'allowed women somewhere to go when they were out shopping. No respectable woman would go to a pub and there were even very few public toilets for women'.

'Quong Tart had become a merchant trading int tea and silk from China and he saw a business opportunity in providing space for women who could not meet up except in each other's homes and then that was only if they came from the same class.

'The tearooms offered women of all classes a place to meet, socialise and collaborate on social causes such as the right to vote, temperance, the right for all children to attend a kindergarten and other women’s rights.

'They were a place for ladies who lunched, the social reformers and a source of employment for women - the waitresses who served them all.'

English society: Chinese immigrants and women in Sydney like Ellen Shing, pictured (above) in the south-0western Sydney suburb of Canterbury either in 1902 or 1903 were able to integrate into society and become gentlewomen. Ms Shing's father was a Chinese draper who serviced the NSW goldfields and her mother was half-Chinese

The Celestial Sydney exhibition, Dr Teffer said, captures life in 1890s Sydney for Chinese immigrants.

'From opium dens, race riots to mixed marriages, it captures both the darkest moments of Australia’s multicultural journey and the triumph of one of our most influential and respected communities,' she said, 'and Quong Tart was a big part of Chinese people being accepted.'

Arriving in 1959, the young Quong Tart went to live at Bell's Creek with a Scottish store holder. He thereon had a love of all things Scottish, quoted Robbie Burns poetry, and later wore a kilt on formal occasions.

Quong Tart also promoted the cause of Chinese immigrants to Australia at a time of strong anti-Chinese sentiment and campaigned against the opium trade which flourished in Sydney in the late nineteenth and early 20th century.

Quong Tart married English-born, Margaret, and enjoyed a successful marriage and had four children at a time when Chinese people were not considered 'white' in Australia and Quong Tart managed to battle racial prejudice with his charm and intelligence, Dr Teffer said.

He acted as a consul to what was at the time the imperial Chinese government, which made him an honorary Mandarin in 1887.

When Chinese ambassadors made their first visit to Australia , Generals Ho and Tsing personally bestowed upon Quong Tart the honour 'for valuable services rendered on behalf of his countrymen'.

'Chinese immigrants had been brought over to NSW primarily as cheap labour from the late 1840s and there was a very strong anti-Chinese sentiment,'  Dr Teffer said.

'Quong Tart transcended that. He became a successful businessman and something of a celebrity who enjoyed the spotlight. He fought the trade in opium which was legal in NSW until 1906.

'He fully assimilated and became westernised it was in neutral territory like his tea rooms that women met and formulated electoral reforms and formed groups like the launderers' and typewriters associations.'
