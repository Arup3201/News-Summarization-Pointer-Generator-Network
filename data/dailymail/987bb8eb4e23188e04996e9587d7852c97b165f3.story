Her thick mahogany locks that rarely look anything less than glossy and perfectly blowdried have, unsurprisingly, become her trademark. Her style, known as the Chelsea Blowdry, has become one of the most popular looks of our time. And just a month ago, she even gave the 70s fringe a serious style revival.

So it comes as no surprise that the Duchess of Cambridge has taken the crown as she topped the list of 'Most Iconic Hairstyles of 2012'.

The award, as voted for by a panel of judges and the public, saw songstress Emeli Sandé's cool, cropped locks take second place and London mayor Boris Johnson's blonde mop come in third.

A spokesman for Fabriah.com, who carried out the research, said: 'Although his unruly mop top scored relatively poorly with the judges, huge public support pushed [Johnson] into the bronze medal position.'

The former Kate Middleton wasn't the only royal to enter the list. The Queen, who showed off her perfectly set silver locks at the Jubilee and Summer Games, took fourth place.

Olympian Bradley Wiggins came in fifth, singer Lana Del Rey in sixth and heartthrob and one fifth of One Direction Harry Styles made it to seventh.

Two ladies who usually rank high when it comes to their luscious locks, Cheryl Cole and Holly Willoughby, appeared lower than usual in eighth and ninth place respectively.

A surprise (and non-human) entry this 
year was winner of Britain's Got Talent and Simon Cowell's best pooch 
friend, Pudsey the dog.
