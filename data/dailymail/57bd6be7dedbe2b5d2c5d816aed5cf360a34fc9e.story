A burglar has been jailed after being caught when he left his mobile phone behind at a house he had just robbed.

Scott Barker's phone was ringing when police arrived at the home, where he had taken jewellery and bank cards belonging to a pensioner.

The blunder was so stupid that his own lawyer used it as evidence that he was an unsophisticated chancer, rather than a 'professional burglar'.

On November 12 Barker, 38, forced his way into the Grimsby home of Ronald Collins, a retiree who was out for the afternoon, through the rear window.

After picking up the wallet and jewellery, he left via the same route - but dropped his mobile, as well as the tool he used to enter the house.

When police arrived they found the phone ringing, with the name 'Babe' coming up on the screen, Grimsby Crown Court heard.

Minutes later they were confronted by Barker's girlfriend, Jessica Hines, claiming her house was on fire and asking for help.

'She wanted the officers to come away from the house,' prosecutor Gordon Stables said.

'This was a clumsy attempt to distract the police so the defendant could retrieve his phone.'

Officers searched her and found Mr Collins' wallet, but after they arrested Barker and he confessed to the crime, Ms Hines was released without charge.

Barker pleaded guilty to burglary, as well as two counts of shop theft from the same month.

Robert Underwood, mitigating, said his client was 'driven by a need for money' after being denied benefits.

'There was no sophistication about the offences,' he said. 'What professional burglar leaves his mobile phone at the scene?'

Recorder Paul Miller jailed Barker for nine months for the burglary and four months for each of the two shoplifting offences, to run concurrently.

Mr Stables told the court the defendant had 109 offences on his record and had received 31 convictions, including for burglary.

He said the two shoplifting offences both took place at the Grimsby branch of Asda.

On November 10 Barker filled a trolley with £549 worth of goods and left without paying, then five days later he did the same with £701 of goods.
