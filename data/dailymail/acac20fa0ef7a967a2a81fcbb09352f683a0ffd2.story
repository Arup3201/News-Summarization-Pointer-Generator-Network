IT takes a lot to unite Unionists and republicans in Northern Ireland – but the BBC has done it with just a few TV subtitles.

Countryfile interviewed famed 96-year-old blacksmith Barney Devlin about Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney, whose poem The Forge he inspired.

But to help viewers understand the County Londonderry craftsman’s accent, subtitles were added to the screen, angering politicians across the political divide. Sinn Fein MP Francie Molloy said: ‘This is part of an ongoing process by the BBC of insulting the Irish people both in culture and language, in this occasion putting subtitles over the voice.

BBC producers decided to add subtitles to Barney Devlin's interview on Countryfile due to his accent 

‘The subtitles were only coming up for Barney. In other episodes of the programme, which covers different parts of the country, indeed the world, it’s very seldom that you do see subtitles being used. Seamus Heaney was from the same part of the country and he was never subtitled. The people of south Derry have complained to us so we’re passing that on to the BBC.’

Peter Weir, from the Democratic Unionist Party, said: ‘The use of subtitles was both unnecessary and somewhat insulting.

‘I sometimes see Countryfile and I can’t remember another occasion, despite the wide range of accents you hear in the United Kingdom, that I saw somebody subtitled. Somebody at the BBC has acted in a slightly patronising and unnecessary way.’

A spokesman for Countryfile said: ‘We wanted as wide an audience as possible to appreciate Barney Devlin’s evocative memories of blacksmithing and of Seamus Heaney.

‘We discussed with Mr Devlin using subtitles and he was happy for this to happen.’

The Countryfile episode featuring Mr Devlin was first broadcast in August but was repeated on Sunday.
