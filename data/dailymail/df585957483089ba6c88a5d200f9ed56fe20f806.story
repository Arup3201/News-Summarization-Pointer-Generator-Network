She's famous for stepping out in tiny bottom-baring shorts and is a fan of the crop top too but Rihanna's ab-baring antics won't win her many few fans among men.

New research has shown that far from being fans of revealing clothes, men prefer women like the Duchess of Cambridge who plump for feminine, demure styles.

The survey found that 45 per cent of British men preferred elegant dressers, with just 31 per cent saying they liked revealing styles.

Another 17 per cent said they didn't mind what a potential date wore - provided she was attractive - and, in a finding guaranteed to raise a few feminine hackles, the vast majority said they were more likely to respect a woman who covered up.

More than half claimed they would 
respect a woman more if she had a reserved style, while a  quarter said it depended on the woman in question.

Just 22 per cent of men said they 
would respect a woman if she was sporting a revealing outfit.

While demure styles have enjoyed a spike in sales thanks to the Kate effect, Rihanna's debut collection for River Island was a huge success - proof that not everyone is a fan of the royal dress sense.

Other celebrity women have also chosen to follow Rihanna's lead, with Miley Cyrus, Cara Delevingne and the entire cast of The Only Way Is Essex among those regularly seen in low cut tops and buttock scraping shorts.

Despite their demand for demure dressing, it appears that looks rather than dress sense are the deciding factor in whether a man approaches a woman in a bar or not.

According to the study, 61 per cent of British men claimed they went out specifically to meet members of the opposite sex, with 67 per cent saying that they would approach an attractive woman if they saw someone they liked in a bar or club. 

When asked which sort of woman would be more likely get their phone number, 55 per cent said it would be a woman in a dressed in a 'classy' outfit.

The poll also revealed that 38 per cent of men admitted to feeling intimidated by women in revealing outfits. 

George Charles of VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, the website that conducted the survey, said: 'We were interested in discovering whether or not men were more likely to approach women who wore a specific style of clothing and whether this impacted their decisions to give out their number.

'Surprisingly, more men preferred to approach women who were wearing reserved and classy attire rather than a revealing outfit.

'As the results prove, it shows that men do notice women’s clothes, so perhaps keep this in mind when planning your next party outfit.

'Tailoring your look before going out and perhaps toning it down will make you feel more comfortable, which is the most important thing.'
