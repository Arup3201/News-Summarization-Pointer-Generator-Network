The argument to drop Wayne Rooney — if there has to be one — starts with Daniel Sturridge, who is the England player most likely to score a goal at the moment.

Sturridge has earned the right to be considered England’s centre forward after a prolific season at Liverpool and goals in his last two internationals.

Plenty to ponder: Hodgson named a strong team, including Rooney, for the final game on home soil before the World Cup

With 27 goals in 38 games for club and
 country, he has forced Roy Hodgson to hand over the No 9 shirt and play
 him in the centre, nearest the goal, rather than out wide as he has in 
the past.

This means finding
 somewhere else for Rooney to operate. It ought not to be a problem. He 
can simply play off Sturridge, in the No 10 role, or even alongside him 
in (whisper it) something like a 4-4-2 formation.

For
 a long time, Rooney’s best position was thought to be off the main 
striker, between the lines of midfield and attack. But in general his 
most productive games for England, since Euro 2004, have been as a 
centre forward.

He has 
enjoyed two purple patches: one under Fabio Capello in qualification for
 the 2010 World Cup, often playing alongside Emile Heskey, and another 
since Hodgson took over, with 10 of his 38 international goals in 16 
games under the current manager. Sturridge,  however, is not conducive 
to strike  partnerships.

Even
 at Liverpool this season, where he and Luis Suarez have been brilliant,
 Sturridge had a better goals-per-minute ratio without the Uruguayan.

In
 the last two England games, he has come alive, seemed freer, using the 
space left once Rooney has been replaced — after an hour against  
Denmark and after 66 minutes against Peru.

Do
 they inhibit each other? Does Hodgson sacrifice Rooney to get more from
 Sturridge, who is four years younger? At 28, this could even be 
Rooney’s final World Cup, playing as he does in a young man’s position.

Does
 Hodgson persevere with them together?  Should England use their two 
friendlies in Miami, against Ecuador on Wednesday and Honduras on 
Saturday, to work on a better understanding and improve Rooney’s 
match-sharpness?

Friday’s 
3-0 win against Peru was Rooney’s first game in more than a month. 
Although he worked hard and looks in superb physical condition, he may 
appreciate another chance to play and refine his touch; perhaps  even 
find his first international goal since October.

All aboard: The England squad have flown to Miami to continue their World Cup preparations

Yet to make a mark: The 28-year-old hasn't scored for England at a World Cup and time could be running out

‘Our
 plan on Wednesday is basically  to start the people who didn’t start on
 Friday,’ said Hodgson. ‘That would be the plan, but plans like that 
sometimes go astray and I’m not prepared to make any promises.’

The
 argument is complicated by the emergence of others. Adam Lallana’s 
international career has started with promise, while Hodgson is fond of 
Danny Welbeck’s pace.

Against
 some of the better teams at the World Cup, particularly against Italy 
in the opening game when possession will be crucial, there must be a 
temptation for Hodgson to clutter the midfield with three specialists — 
Steven Gerrard, Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson, for example, with 
wingers either side and one up front.

Alternatively,
 Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley are capable of playing in the hole 
behind the main striker in a  4-2-3-1 shape. It is where Sterling played
 when he first came on for Rooney against Peru.

‘It
 would be stupid for me to say on the basis of just a few minutes that 
this is Raheem Sterling’s best position,’ said Hodgson. ‘I’m not even 
certain I necessarily want Raheem to have a best position.

‘I
 want him to be able to play in the position where we need him. On 
Friday, we thought it would be good to bring him on initially in the 
position behind the front player, where we’ve seen him play well.

‘But
 then we wanted to bring Ross Barkley on, so we moved him wide and he 
did OK there. I’m sure he’s going to be a very big player going forward,
 but I would rather see some of these younger players treated with a 
little more caution.’

Hodgson
 warned against an obsession with Rooney but the mere fact this debate 
is open is encouraging for England. Normally these tournaments are 
preceded by heaping pressure on his shoulders to carry the nation 
through.

This time there is 
an option to use him tactically: send him out for an hour without being 
afraid to haul him off. It might even be a way for him to be more 
effective, although it will be a brave move by Hodgson, with no way of 
knowing how he might react to being left out.

It
 is not a question of discarding him, it is about getting the best from 
him. Rooney will be a key weapon for  England at the World Cup.
