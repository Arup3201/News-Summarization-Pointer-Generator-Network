Plans for a seven-day NHS are 'not realistic' and would require more funding, a leading doctors have warned.

The proposal to make NHS hospitals offer a full range of healthcare services, including elective operations and diagnostic tests, seven days a week was first announced in 2013 by NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh.

He suggested hospital trusts could be contractually obliged to do so and face fines for breaches. 

But Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) council, said offering services on Saturdays and Sundays would lead to them being cancelled during the week.

Plans to make hospitals offer a full range of healthcare services seven days a week are 'not realistic' and would require more funding, the British Medical Union (BMA) has warned

This would amount to a 'diversion of services' rather than an expansion, he said.

Dr Porter, speaking to the Guardian, said: 'It's not realistic to carry on doing what we are doing at the moment and then add a new service on top of it within existing resources. More money is vital.

'If the decision (by a hospital) is taken to put half a dozen outpatient clinics on a Sunday afternoon then they have to be taken from somewhere else - that is, they won't be on on a particular day during the week.

'That's the inescapable reality of doing this within existing resources, but politicians' vision doesn't go into that sort of detail.' 

The criticism was made following the BMA's submission to the Doctors and Dentists Review Body, which advises the Government on doctors' pay. 

Writing in its submission, the BMA warned: 'Ill-thought-through implementation could threaten both the standard of service patients receive and the viability of the service.

'We believe that pursuing an ill-informed seven-day service model would be at best wasteful for the NHS – and at worst threaten patient safety.'

In July last year, Sir Bruce said making the NHS provide seven-day services was his 'number one priority'.

His review came after statistics showed there was a higher mortality rate at weekends - as high as 11 per cent on a Saturday and 16 per cent on a Sunday, according to an analysis of more than 14 million hospital admissions in 2009/10.

BMA chairman Dr Mark Porter (pictured) said putting on services on Saturdays and Sundays would lead to them being cancelled during the week, leading to a 'diversion' rather than an expansion of services

The changes could cost around £1 billion to implement with routine surgery for minor conditions, such as hernias, as well as blood tests, X-rays, ultrasounds and MRI scans to be carried out at weekends.

Speaking in December 2013, Sir Bruce, said: 'It seems strange in many ways that we should start to wind down on a Friday afternoon and warm up on a Sunday while operating theatres are empty, outpatient clinics echo, expensive diagnostic kit isn't being used and in the meantime people are waiting for diagnosis and treatment.'

Last year David Cameron also promised that everyone would have access to a family doctor seven days a week by the end of the decade.

He wants GPs to open for up to 12 hours every day by 2020 to relieve pressure on accident and emergency units, which are becoming overwhelmed due to dissatisfaction with out-of-hours GP services.

But the BMA have warned the plans will waste resources and threaten the quality of care during the week.
