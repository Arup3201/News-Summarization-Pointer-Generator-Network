An anti-shake spoon is allowing people with frustrating and disabling tremors enjoy their favourite foods once more.

The Liftware spoon detects and then cancels out shakes and judders, allowing soup, cereal and other hard to manipulate foods be eaten with ease.

The technology, which has been bought by Google, is aimed at Parkinson’s patients and other people with tremors.

The £180  spoon has revolutionary electronics in its handle, which can cancel out shakes by 70 per cent

Uncontrollable shaking of the hand or arm is one of the first symptoms of Parkinson’s.

But it can also occur in otherwise healthy people, with four in 100 adults aged 40-plus suffering from an essential tremor that when severe can make eating, drinking and writing extremely difficult.

Cutting-edge electronics hidden in chunky handle of the Liftware spoon sense the tremor.

They then move the handle in the opposite direction, to cancel out the shake.

Similar technology is used in cameras to compensate for unsteady hands.

The spoon’s creators, at San Francisco-based Lift Labs, say that it puts the dignity and enjoyment back into mealtimes.

And that in trials, it cut tremors by more than 70 per cent.

A spokesman said: ‘Mealtime brings people together. It is more than a time for nourishing the body, we nourish our spirit and relationships.

‘A tremor, whether from essential tremor or Parkinson’s disease takes away from this experience, forcing people to focus instead on the basic task of eating.

‘We’ve invented the Liftware spoon to cancel hand tremor and take the frustration out of eating.

‘We are proud to offer a product that allows people to take charge of their tremor.’

At £180 the electronic spoon isn’t cheap – however, it does come with a 30-day money back guarantee.

 While Lift Labs is marketing the spoon at Parkinson's sufferers, charity Parkinson's UK say that people with the disease suffer tremors when their hand is at rest, meaning the spoon may not be useful

One customer told how the spoon allowed them to eat a bowl of cereal for the first time in years.

Another told how they have eaten ‘multiple bowls’ of soup and cereal without spilling a drop.

Fork and key holder attachments are also planned for the handle, which is comes with an electric toothbrush-like charger.

Announcing its purchase of Lift Labs, Google said the technology ‘could improve quality of life for millions of people’.

Google is increasingly investing in health technology. Its co-founder Sergey Brin has a personal interest in Parkinson’s. His mother has the disease and he carries a gene that raises his odds of developing it.

However, Parkinson’s UK has questioned how useful the spoon will be for the 127,000 Britons with the disease.

Daiga Heisters, the charity’s head of education, said: ‘The majority of people with Parkinson’s only have a tremor when their hand is resting and so this technology won’t help them.’
