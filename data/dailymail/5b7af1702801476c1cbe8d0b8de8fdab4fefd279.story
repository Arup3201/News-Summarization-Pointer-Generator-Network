Devastated British tycoon Alan Bond yesterday spoke of his grief after his wife was found dead at their mansion.

Mr Bond, 73, appeared frail and tearful as he emerged from his home in Perth, Western Australia, where Diana Bliss, 57, is understood to have been found floating in the swimming pool.

The disgraced multi-millionaire is believed to battled desperately to revive his wife, a former air stewardess, and called an ambulance at around 11.30 am.

Speaking outside the family home, he said: 'It's so new... I've lost my beautiful wife,' according to PerthNow.

It is understood that the family 
briefly went to church in the morning. Mr Bond's daughter Jody Fewster 
later gave a statement confirming that Miss Bliss had been 'sick for a 
while'.

'But no one would have expected all this,' Ms Fewster added.

'The family is devastated, her friends
 are devastated and dad just can’t talk at the moment. We would really 
appreciate a little bit of privacy at this time.

'I just really appreciate your interest because she was beautiful but that’s all about we can say at the moment.'

Flamboyant Bond – who was jailed for 
fraud, lost a fortune and bounced back to make another – may have raised
 the alarm himself after the tragedy.

Neighbours in Cottesloe, a suburb of Perth in Western Australia, said Ms Bliss had been struggling with personal problems.

Residents said she had lost a lot  of 
weight recently and had been  battling anxiety and depression for 
several years. One said she had received treatment for depression in a 
London clinic last year.

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I saw her a week ago and she looked terrible.’

Police said last night that there were
 no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of Australian-born Ms
 Bliss, the daughter of a Methodist minister.

A police spokesman said: ‘About 
11.30am local time, Western Australian Police were notified by St John 
Ambulance of a deceased woman at Hawkstone Street, Cottesloe.’

The spokesman said a report would be sent to the coroner.

Friends and former colleagues of Ms Bliss have been paying tribute to the 'bubbly, talented and honest' theatre producer.

Tony Bonney said the death of Ms Bliss in was a tragic loss.

'The most admirable thing about her 
was she had such a great passion for theatre and performance,' Tony 
Bonney told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'I was working at the Blue Room when I
 first met her; she was very bubbly with an infectious attitude, but 
smart, very well connected and very honest.'

Entertainment publicist Rosita Stangl added:  'She was highly regarded by some of Australia’s top theatre promoters.'

Ms Stangl said that Miss Bliss had been in demand after a string of successes in London's West End.

'If you make it in the West End, you 
are doing very well, that’s why those in the Australian theatre industry

The tragedy comes 12 years after 
Bond’s showjumper daughter Susanne Edwards – the second of his four children – died
 at her Perth home aged 41 after apparently overdosing on prescription 
drugs.

Death: Miss Bliss was Mr Bond's second wife and had stood by him despite his time in jail and bankruptcy

Ms Bliss, who had worked as a Qantas 
flight attendant, in public relations and later as a successful theatre 
producer, married Bond in 1995 after he had been discharged as a 
bankrupt.

He was divorced from his first wife, Eileen, three years earlier.

Bond, 73, who emigrated with his 
parents from London to Australia in 1950, began as a signwriter but went
 on to become a multi-millionaire whose investments in airships, 
property, breweries and diamond mines enabled him to bankroll challenges
 for the America’s Cup, the premier international yacht race.

In 1983, his Australia II Syndicate won the trophy, which had been  held by the New York Yacht Club since 1851.

In 1987, Bond controversially bought 
Vincent van Gogh’s Irises for £36 million – at the time the highest 
price paid for a single painting.

But the purchase was subsidised by a 
substantial loan from auctioneer Sotheby’s, which Bond failed to repay. 
Art experts suggested it may have been a manipulated sale designed to 
artificially inflate the value.

After his empire collapsed, Bond was 
declared bankrupt in 1992 with personal debts of £1.2 billion. He was 
jailed for seven years in 1997 after pleading guilty to using his 
controlling interest in the Bell Resources company to siphon off more 
than £800 million into the  coffers of his Bond Corporation. He served 
four years in jail and since then he has worked with his son, Craig, to 
build up a new fortune in oil and diamonds.

By 2008, Bond was said to be worth about £170 million.
