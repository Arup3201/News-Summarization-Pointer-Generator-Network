A former Hollywood starlet who worked alongside the likes of Beyoncé, Ryan Reynolds and Kylie Minogue, has faced court on charges of aggravated burglary.

She also worked as a personal trainer for celebrities like Beyoncé and Shakira and played a minor role in a 2006 Hollywood film Smokin' Aces which featured Ryan Reynolds and Ben Affleck.

On Wednesday, Unlu faced the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on charges of 'aggravated burglary, assault, intentionally cause injury, recklessly cause injury, theft and going equipped to steal'.

She and Bowden were dressed in all camouflage and hiding behind a tree when they were arrested by police, who also found night-vision goggles at the scene of the burglary-turned-stabbing, according to The Age.

An out of sessions hearing was told that the duo became involved in a scuffle at their victims' home when the residents woke to find a man standing at their bed with a knife while demanding money at 4am.

Police alleged that two male victims received stab wounds to their hands before a female victim managed to discard the offender's knife.

Unlu and Bowden managed to escape with up to $2000 worth of cash and stolen items, including cosmetics and car keys, before they were arrested by police, according to the Herald Sun.

The court was also told that the former dancer suffered from depression and anxiety which lead to what her lawyer called 'mini heart attacks'.

Bowden has been charged with aggravated burglary, assault, intentionally cause injury, recklessly cause injury, theft and going equipped to steal. 

The pair will reappear in court in April.
