Panicking Tory chiefs want double Olympic gold medallist James Cracknell to stop Ukip inflicting another by-election humiliation on the party.

They are appealing to the rowing star to take on Ukip’s Mark Reckless, who defected from the Tories, in the Rochester and Strood by-election which is expected to be held next month.

The Conservative candidate is likely to be chosen in an ‘open primary’ – with all voters across the constituency eligible to take part.

Tory party strategists want Olympic gold medalist James Cracknell to fight  in the next by-election 

Senior Tory sources last night confirmed that they would like the 42-year-old to throw his hat in the ring. One said: ‘It’ll be up to local voters in Rochester and Strood but James would be a real asset for the party.’

A Eurosceptic, the former oarsman has already made clear he wants to stand for Parliament. The father-of-three is understood to have applied for the nomination in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, which was won by Boris Johnson.

Mr Cracknell, who stood for the Tories unsuccessfully in last May’s European elections, has been working with the think tank Policy Exchange on the impact on society of obesity. He was last night unavailable for comment.
