A teenage girl who was snatched from a city street in Africa three years ago has mysteriously shown up in Derby.

Police say the 17-year-old was dropped off by a man in a dark blue car who told her to 'find the nearest police station'.

After receiving help from passers-by, the girl, who hasn't been named, went to Roe Farm Lane station in Chaddesden.

The girl told officers she was 
kidnapped in Banjul, the capital of Gambia, as she walked to school in 
2009 and was taken to the UK shortly after, via France.

But
she said she had no idea where she had been held while in Britain, 
according to Detective Inspector Paul Tatlow, who is trying to determine
whether it was even in Derbyshire.

DI Tatlow said the teenager was dumped on the side of a road in Chaddesden on Thursday afternoon by the man and she arrived at the nearby police station at about 6pm that evening.

DI Tatlow said the case was 'very unusual' for his team.

'At this early stage, we do not know why this man chose to bring her to Derby, if she has even been to Derbyshire before, or if there is any link to the city,' he said.

'From the date of birth and the information she has given us so far, we believe she was snatched on the streets of Banjul, Gambia, as she walked to school three years ago.

'She was then brought into the UK 
through various stop-off points in Europe, including France. But the 
girl has no recollection of where she has been living for the past three
years.

The teenager was walking around Derby, pictured, for 40 minutes before she stopped to ask someone for directions to the police station

'Although our investigations are only just under way, we do not believe she was brought into the country to work in prostitution.'

Officers are trying to trace the girl's movements in Derby and identify the car and driver, who is a suspect in her abduction.

'We know from talking to her that seven or eight people whom she spoke to in Chaddesden offered to help her,' DI Tatlow said.

'Some told her she could use their mobile phones because, by doing so, the police would come to her. But we understand she was told by the man that dropped her off to ask for directions to the police station and that is what she was determined to do.

'At the moment, we are trying to find out more about exactly where in Derby she was dropped off. She has told us she was walking for around 40 minutes before she started asking people for directions.

'For us, we are very much working backwards, trying to trace her movements from the time she arrived at Roe Farm.'
