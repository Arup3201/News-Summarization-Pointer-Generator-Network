If Chelsea blowing key Premier League rivals out of the summer transfer water wasn’t patently obvious already, it is now. The leaders — and their £32million striker — look unstoppable.

Diego Costa’s hat-trick against Swansea on Saturday was alluring in its simplicity and illustrated just what Jose Mourinho, by his own admission, had been missing: a fine, unadulterated finisher.

The manager is insistent that refusing to dive headfirst into an overpriced market last summer has proved correct, instead biding his time for the right man.

Diego Costa has been hugely impressive for Chelsea since joining from Atletico Madrid in the summer

Diego Costa will be looking to fill his boots against a Schalke side who lost 4-1 to Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday. Last season’s third-placed team have yet to record a win this campaign and sit second from bottom in the Bundesliga table with a goal difference of minus four. As speculation increases about Jens Keller’s tenure at the club, the manager said: ‘We’ve just got to remain calm. We mustn’t do anything rash.’ 

He’s got him all right. That’s seven in his opening four games. The former Atletico Madrid bruiser, who joked that he is yet to win a header in England, is making a mockery of similar money lavished elsewhere.

For all the talk about his prowess in front of goal, there is a message Mourinho wants to get across. Chelsea have bought more than just a poacher capable of nudging home a Cesc Fabregas assist from six yards.

They managed to squeeze £28m out of Everton for Romelu Lukaku while doing homework on Costa properly, bringing in someone who has instantly become a leader at Stamford Bridge. Perhaps not an individual to overtly coerce performances from others, but whose battling spirit makes them follow.

Jose Mourinho waited to sign Diego Costa instead of entering and inflated transfer market last summer

Diego Costa is a superb centre-forward who plays like an old-fashioned English target man. He is no lightweight soft foreigner and was incorrectly cautioned in his first game for diving at Burnley. There was evidence of the more robust nature of his play when he strongly pushed away Swansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson  after he was being held in the area. Perhaps he could have been cautioned had referee Kevin Friend been slavish to the law, but there was nothing I saw to suggest he should have been sent off. The fact he was not even booked perhaps levelled things up after his yellow card at Turf Moor. 

Mourinho wouldn’t have a prayer of persuading Costa to have a rest without serious cause. Last week’s hamstring complaint didn’t keep him out at the weekend and it will take something special for the 25-year-old not to be in Wednesday’s starting XI against Schalke in the Champions League.

‘The most important thing of a player’s character is what affects his performance,’ Mourinho said. ‘He was a risk and a doubt before Everton, a risk and a doubt before the Spain game (against France), a risk and a doubt before this game and he played all three.

‘He is a risk and a doubt again for next Wednesday because of an accumulation of matches but nobody can stop him.’

Mourinho has tried to have a word but it falls on deaf ears. ‘If the injury is a clear injury of course, yes, but when the doubt is there and he has not the best feelings but he feels he can, he goes (on). He knows exactly what the team needs and is ready to give,’ said the Chelsea manager.

The Brazilian born Spanish striker has now scored seven goals in four games for Chelsea

‘It is not about the modern player, it is about the modern society. The education they get, the people they have sometimes behind them, make them be a little bit more selfish in the sense of you first and the team second.

‘When you get guys with this mentality they become special and they can be an influence to the people around them.’ Like John Terry? ‘Yeah, yeah.’

Costa asserts that he is ‘adapting very well’ to life in English football. So well, in fact, that he sounded just like his skipper. 

Jose Mourinho said of Diego Costa: ‘When you get guys with this mentality they become special'

‘The key is the group we have,’ he said. ‘It is like a family...we are working together and the truth is that things are going very well for all of us.’

Chelsea seem to have the whole package here and even one who appears to know who ex-Newcastle striker Quinn is. ‘I am very happy to have this record. A striker has to score and I am happy that I have a little place in history,’ he said.

The only blot is that Costa has not yet been out in London to immerse himself in the capital. That will come, but for now he’s the man who can do no wrong.
