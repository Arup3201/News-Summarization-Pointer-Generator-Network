It has been visited by big names such as P. Diddy, Tupac and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, but the majority of guests at this ‘Manhattan hot spot’ are not dropping in voluntarily, and there certainly is no VIP section.

As well as Rockefeller Center, The Empire State Building and Central Park, New York City tourists are now adding Manhattan Criminal Court to their must-see list.

The ‘night court’ is a chance for tourists to see real life U.S. law-and-order in action, portrayed in numerous television shows and films.

The court on lower Manhattan handles dozens of cases in the late hours, a practice which is attracting a rising number of tourists.

Manhattan Criminal Court handles more than 100,000 arrests a year, averaging about 70 to 90 cases during the 5pm-1am night session.

It is one of New York's more peculiar and paradoxical tourist traditions, a place visitors extol on travel websites while many residents hope never to wind up there.

To travelers, it is a form of gritty entertainment, hard-knocks education or at least a chance to experience real-life law and order on a New York scale.

Dozens of jurisdictions nationwide hold nightly court sessions, but thanks to television series such as Law & Order and Night Court, as well as arraignments of real-life celebrities, from rapper Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs to former child actress Amanda Bynes, Manhattan Criminal has become famous in its own right.

'It's very interesting to hear real cases,’ Jenny Baumann, a 26-year-old tourist from Munich, Germany, said as she watched judge decide whether to set bail for people facing charges ranging from choking a girlfriend to stealing a six-pack of beer.

Each case is handled in a matter of minutes amid a hive of clerks shuffling paperwork, police taking retinal scans, defendants and lawyers conferring in a confessional-sized glass booth and court officers occasionally bellowing, ‘Quiet, please!’

Established in 1907, Manhattan night court once attracted such spectators as John D. Rockefeller and the then-Duke of Manchester.

More recently, it's been noted in tour books, including a mention in the off-the-beaten-path Lonely Planet guide.

‘This is something that feels really underground and unique,’ said Regis St. Louis, author of the current Lonely Planet New York book.

Night court is so popular that veteran clerk Robert Smith has become an impromptu tour guide for school groups from as far away as Denmark, judges from Japan and individual sightseers he spots in the audience.

‘I try to make it informative’ by explaining the process, he says.

‘It is a "just-off-Broadway show" with a cast of thousands, ever-changing story lines ... real drama, as well as occasional comic relief,’ said Edward McCarthy, who oversees the Legal Aid Society's defense work there.

But if it can be entertaining to watch, it's fraught and serious work,acting State Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson, the Criminal Court's supervising judge from 2008 through 2012 says.

‘From the judge's perspective and all of the attorneys' who work so hard, there's nothing amusing about it,’ she said. ‘And the stakes are very high.’

Some court tourists are legal workers or law students seeking to educate themselves about New York's justice system, or parents or who want to teach their children about it.

Adam Jory Waxman and his wife took their 16-year-old son there last month while visiting from the Atlanta area, hoping it would be a lesson in choices and consequences. And it was.

‘He saw that people got themselves in trouble and that there wasn't anything they could do about it until a judge made a decision,’ Waxman said.

After two hours in Manhattan night court, Baumann came away determined to observe a court back in Germany.

As she left, Holly Young was in the midst of her own first visit to the Manhattan court, waiting for a friend's arraignment.

Go there for fun? She shook her head.

‘That's not something I would want to do,’ she said. ‘I don't think this is cool at all.’
