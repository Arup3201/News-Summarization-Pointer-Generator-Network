An animal lover was left horrified when she picked her dog up from a grooming salon to find that staff had shaved off all of its fur.

Snieguole Ghuman, 50, only dropped off her German Shepherd Simba at the canine beauty parlour for a wash and brush to remove some matted fur.

But when she returned she expected to see her beloved pet’s white coat looking fluffy and groomed, but was shocked when she found him almost completely bald, which has left Simba 'depressed'.

Simba is now only walked at night because people laugh and sneer when they see him, her owner says.

Staff at the salon had shaved off all the hair from the dog’s body leaving just his head covered in the inch thick fur.

When she asked the staff what had happened, she was told they had no choice and had acted on advice from the RSPCA.

Gemma Barnett, owner of the Starz Grooming Salon in Bournemouth, Dorset,explained that Simba had been so matted she had no choice but to call them, and shave it all off.

Snieguole, who is also from Bournemouth, says she has now been forced to stop walking Simba during the day due to pointing and staring from members of the public.

Snieguole’s daughter, Brigita Pritchett, 28, said: 'My mum had taken him in two weeks previously and asked for a wash and brush to sort his coat out.

'He can get very matted as his fur is so thick and he loves going in the sea and mud which can make it like it.

'Then the next thing she knew was there was an RSPCA officer knocking on her door and the salon owner had reported her.

'My mum arranged to bring him back there and get it sorted, but when she went to pick him up all his fur had completely gone.

'The problem areas were just his belly and slightly on his legs, so I couldn’t understand why they needed to shave him completely.

'He is a very sensitive dog and my mum said you could tell he didn’t like it, people then started pointing and staring at him as they walked home and he is now very depressed.

'Now she is forced to walk him at night because of all the looks they are getting.'Miss Barnett, 19, said that Simba was so matted she had no choice but to clip his fur to the short length, as less severe blades would only get stuck in the thick coat.

'Simba had been in twice before I called the RSPCA, and I had said to the owner both times that he needed to be clipped as his fur was so matted.

'She then agreed to come in for a clip. I tried to use a different blade but it wouldn’t go through his fur, so I used a shorter one.

'The only reason it looks so short is because it’s a white dog, on a black dog it wouldn’t look so bad. I had to remove as much fur as I did because it was that badly matted.

'His skin was blood red because the knots were pulling it so badly, I do what is best for the dog and their welfare and happiness.'

A spokesperson for the RSPCA confirmed that they had received a complaint and are investigating the issue.
