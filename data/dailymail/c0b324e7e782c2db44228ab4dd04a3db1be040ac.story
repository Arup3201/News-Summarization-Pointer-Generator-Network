Cristiano Ronaldo almost joined Birmingham City before choosing Manchester United, according to the Blues' former owner David Sullivan.

Speaking on Soccer AM on Saturday morning, Sullivan opened up about the time he came close to signing the Real Madrid superstar, who is this year's favourite for the Ballon d'Or.  

'Before he went to Man United, we were offered him for £6million, and he chose United ahead of us,' Sullivan said.

'There was a deal to be done.

'When he first went to United there were lots of doubts about him. He wasn't the star that he is now.'

Ronaldo spent six successful years at Manchester United, winning three Premier League trophies, one Champions League and one FA Cup.

In 2009 the Portuguese made a switch to Real Madrid for £80million, becoming the then most expensive player in football history. 

Ahead of January's Ballon d'Or ceremony, the 29-year-old looks set to win the award for the third time having already scored 25 goals in La Liga so far this season.
