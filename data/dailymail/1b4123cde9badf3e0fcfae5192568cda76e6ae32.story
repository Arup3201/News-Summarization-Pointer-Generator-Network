Sheron Mancini, 53, walked free from the Old Bailey today after claiming she put gold bars in her BRA in a panic

A woman accused of hiding loot from a £1.1 million bullion snatch inside her bra walked free from court today after claiming she had stashed the ingots in a panic.

Sheron Mancini, from Roydon, Harlow, was said to have used specially-modified underwear in an attempt to smuggle the precious metals back to the UK from Belgium.

But the 53-year-old was cleared of involvement by an Old Bailey jury after insisting she had found the gold bars in her pocket and hidden them down her frontage after panicking when she and lover David Gale, 55, were stopped by police.

Her bespoke bra was handed back to her by Belgian authorities and could not be produced as evidence in court.

But Gale, along with six others including the stepfather of The Only Way Is Essex stars Sam and Billy Faiers, is facing jail for plotting the snatch.

David Chatwood, 57, who shares a house in Brentwood, Essex, with the famous duo, was part of a syndicate who recruited an inside man to steal gold and silver in a fake lorry hi-jacking in Belgium.

Chatwood and Gale, along with lorry driver Brian Mulcahy, 46, Stanley Rose, 74, Matthew Middleton, 41, and Garry Cummings, 50, had already admitted their part.

John Corley, 52, stood trial alongside Mancini and was convicted. He was remanded in custody ahead of sentence on Friday.

Importer-exporters Kyriacos Nicolas, 30, and his father Andreas Nicolas, 50, were said to have been recruited by Corley to help bring the loot back.

But they too were cleared after claiming they had rejected his deal after realising the precious metals were suspect.

Mancini sighed and held her head in her hands as the verdicts were delivered, while Kyriacos Nicolas and his father cheered and embraced.

The court heard Mulcahy was found locked inside the trailer of his vehicle at a service station near Wettern in Belgium in October last year.

He had been transporting a consignment of 55lbs of gold bullion and 330lbs of silver grain from Vilvoorde, near Brussels, back to the UK.

He told officers he had been hijacked at gunpoint and his cargo stolen before he was placed inside his makeshift prison.

But prosecutor John Price QC said his account was ‘pure fiction’.

He said: ‘Mr Mulcahy had not been the victim of a robbery.

‘No violence or threat or violence was used against him.

‘It hadn’t been necessary for anyone to do so because in this instance the driver of the lorry was one of the thieves.’

The gang plotted their crime over several months, taking trips to the continent and staging regular meetings, not realising they were under surveillance.

Most of loot was found on October 13 last year stashed in a room at the de Keyser Hotel and an apartment in Antwerp, both of which had been booked by Stanley Rose.

Mancini and Gale had been caught in a VW Passat heading from the hotel back to the UK two days earlier.

When Mancini was frisked by Belgian police, two gold ingots weighing more than 12oz - and worth more than £13,000 - tumbled out onto the floor.

But she told the court she had gone to Belgium to look at a second hand boat and found the metal in her pockets.

She said when the couple were stopped by police she stuffed it between her breasts.

‘I didn’t know what it was. I panicked and put it in my bra,’ said Mancini.

‘I put them down in between my cleavage. It was between my cleavage and not in the cups.’

The jury giggled when, indicating her breasts to the court, she said: ‘Wearing a bra, these are the cups. This forms the cleavage.’

Corley admitted he had attended meetings with co-conspirators, but claimed he did not realise what was being planned.

Mancini,  Andreas Nicolas, from Bankes Mead, Duxford, and Kyriacos Nicolas, from Winchmore Hill, north London, denied conspiracy to conceal, disguise, convert or transfer criminal property and were found not guilty.

Mancini was earlier cleared of conspiracy to steal before a jury was sworn in after prosecutors offered no evidence.

Kyriacos Nicolas was found not guilty of the same charge partway through the trial after the judge ruled there was insufficient evidence against him.

Corley, of Biggin Hill, Kent, denied conspiracy to steal and was convicted.

Chatwood, from Brentwood, Essex, Mulcahy, from Westcliff-on-Sea, Middleton, of Buckhurst Hill,  Rose, of  Pilgrims Hatch, Brentwood, Gale, of the same Harlow address as Mancini, and Cummings, of Ilford, Essex, have all admitted conspiracy to steal.
