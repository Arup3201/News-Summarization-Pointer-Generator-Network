A lorry driver was inches from death when his truck crashed on a busy motorway into a row of 6ft fence posts - which smashed into the passenger seat.

Despite the wooden poles splintering through the windscreen into the seat next to his, the driver was almost completely unharmed in the crash on the M42 near Tamworth, Staffordshire.

Police and paramedics were called to the crash at 6.30am today after the lorry left the northbound carriageway of the motorway between junctions 10 and 11.

Lucky escape: A lorry driver was inches from death when his truck crashed on a busy motorway into a row of 6ft fence posts - which smashed into the passenger seat but left his seat completely untouched

Flipped: Paramedics arrived at the scene on the M42 in Staffordshire and found the lorry on its side in a ditch

They found the lorry toppled onto its side in a ditch with several wooden posts smashed through the windshield.

Shocking photos taken by paramedics show how the poles shot so far forward that they speared the back of the passenger seat.

The driver's seat was completely unaffected.

The driver in his 40s managed to free himself from the 
wreckage and was treated at the scene before he was sent to be checked over at Queenâ€™s Hospital in Burton-upon-Trent, Stafforshire.

A spokesman for the West Midlands Ambulance Service said the driver had been 'incredibly lucky' to walk away without significant injures.

'We sent an ambulance and a paramedic area support officer to the incident,' the spokesman said.

'The driver, a man in his 40s, was incredibly lucky to avoid being seriously injured in the incident.

'His lorry had overturned and left the motorway prior to the post entering the cab and although we do not know why that happened, we do know there were no other vehicles involved in the incident.

'Ambulance crews assessed the man, who had managed to get himself free from the vehicle, at the scene before taking him to Queens Hospital, Burton, as a precaution.

'The incident did lead to a significant build-up of traffic in the area.'
