A North Carolina U.S. senator had a PR nightmare Tuesday night after she failed to show up for a televised debate, leaving an empty chair to stand in for her.

Kay Hagan, a Democrat struggling to keep her Senate seat in a year when Republicans have captured most of the political momentum, let North Carolina Republican House Speaker Thom Tillis have the entire hour to himself, taking questions from two moderators.

'This is more of a conversation with Speaker Tillis, as opposed to a debate,' remarked Tim Boyum, a Time Warner Cable News anchor tapped to anchor the event.

The race is a virtual dead heat, with Hagan polling 2 percentage points ahead – a razor-thin lead that's inside the margin of error.

North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis got an unfiltered hour of 'debate' time to himself on Tuesday when Senator Kay Hagan refused to show up

Embattled: Sen. Hagan is dogged by new allegations that her husband's company got $387,000 from the 2009 Obama stimulus bill – which she voted for

Hagan's decision to ditch the debate was a political calculation that seemed to backfire

'I'm disappointed that Senator Hagan's not here,' Tillis said in his closing statement, 'particularly because just two days from now North Carolina voters are going to go cast their ballots in early voting.'

The episode brought conservative partisans out of the woodwork on Twitter, with many comparing Hagan's empty chair to another, more famous one.

At the 2012 Republican National Convention, film star Clint Eastwood set up an empty chair representing President Barack Obama and carried on an imaginary conversation with it – complete with pregnant pauses – in front of a nationwide prime-time audience. 

'What do you want me to tell Romney?' he asked the chair, referring to Mitt Romney, the president's GOP opponent.

'I can't tell him to do that to himself,' Eastwood said, after allowing a few seconds for the invisible Obama to talk to him. 

'You're crazy, you're absolutely crazy,' he said. 'You're getting as bad as Biden.'

Tillis, too, made his hour-long messaging monopoly about the president.

'If you want to change President Obama's policies, you have to change your senator,' he said.

Tillis has hit the president hard for his 2009 stimulus package, now that Hagan stands accused of benefiting from her 'yes' vote to pass it.

Her husband's company received more than $387,000 in government handouts and tax credits under the program's renewable energy provisions. 

Tillis' latest staetwide ad includes a narrator recounting the history.

'Days after Kay Hagan took office, she pushed Obama's stimulus bill,' the voice says before cutting to a clip of Hagan saying the infusion of cash would help the country's economy move forward.

'It didn't,' he says. 'But it did help Kay Hagan move forward personally.' 

Clint Eastwood talked to an empty chair – representing President Barack Obama – during the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida

Some on Twitter quickly remembered the last time a political audience was treated to the sight of an empty chair

MSNBC commentator and liberal firebrand Rachel Maddow castigated the Hagan campaign for giving the Republican challenger an unfiltered approach to voters.

'The moderator explained that Thom Tillis' answers wouldn't be timed – they were otherwise planning on timing them – because nobody else needed to talk!' she exclaimed.

'So for you, voters, we present this hour-long conversation with just the Republican candidate. On TV. For an hour. Uncontested,' Maddow continued in disbelief, “so he can tell you what he thinks without any time constraints and without anybody rudely interrupting. Two weeks before Election Day.'

'Did I mention this race is basically tied? I did mention that.' 

Hagan's campaign team busied itself during the debate sending journalists a steady stream of emails contesting Tillis' points as he made them – a tactic that fell flat as reporters wondered why the candidate didn't participate and make her points in person.

'Hagan declined to attend tonight's debate,' a Buzzfeed reporter tweeted. 'Yet so many fact-checks in my inbox.' 

The Tarheel State race is on pace to become the most expensive U.S. Senate contest ever mounted, costing the two sides and their surrogate groups an estimated $100 million in ad buys and other costs.
