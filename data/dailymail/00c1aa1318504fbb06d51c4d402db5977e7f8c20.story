A stork found itself out of its dinner after a hungry eagle stole the fish it had put in hard effort hunting for. 

The saddle-billed stork was caught on camera as it fished for food at the Kruger National Park in South Africa.

However, as the bird readied itself for dinner, a large eagle swooped in, grabbing the fish, leaving the poor stork behind to hunt once more.

Dinner time: The saddle-billed stork has managed to catch a fish for supper at the Kruger National Park

Incoming: An eagle flies in, causing the stork to drop the fish, and the bird of prey goes in for the steal

The stork was filmed wading through a shallow pond, trying to catch a fish, and can be seen being rudely interrupted by the eagle.

As the large wading bird is re-positioning the fish in its large bill, an African fish eagle swoops in, causing the stork to drop its dinner.

The eagle grabs the fish with its claws, and despite the efforts made by the shocked stork, the bird of prey flies off with the prey.

The African fish eagle is known to steal fish that other birds catch, GrindTV reports, which is how it got its name. 

The eagle can be found troughout sub-Saharan Africa and is the national bird of Zimbabwe, Zambia and South Sudan.

My lunch! Despite an effort from the saddle-billed stork, the eagle swoops in and flies off with the fish

Poor birdie: Although the eagle is surely pleased with his catch, the stork is left hungry and has to hunt again
