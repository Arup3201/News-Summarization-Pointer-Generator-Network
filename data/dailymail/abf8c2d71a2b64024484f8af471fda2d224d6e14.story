Shaughnessy also played the drums for performances by Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard on the show.

A close friend of the musician, Robyn Flans said Shaughnessy suffered a fatal heart attack at his home in Calabasas, California, on Friday morning.

Flans, who co-wrote Shaughnessy's autobiography 'Lucky Drummer', told RollingStone.com: 'Every drummer has his story to tell of how kind and generous of spirit he was.

'He influenced so many people. He was the guy. He was on television every night reaching all those people. You always saw the smile behind the kit. That was my Eddie.'

Flans added that Shaughnessy's health had deteriorated over the past two weeks and they had visited the hospital the night before he died as the drummer was feeling unwell.

Shaughnessy joined the band for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1963 after several years working as a CBS staff musician on the Steve Allen and Garry Moore shows.

He remained with Severinsen's band until 1992 but frequently returned to the show for performances.

He also had a prolific jazz career and performed with jazz greats including Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, Ella Fitzgerald and Tony Bennett.

His late wife, Ilene, was the voice of Disney's 'Cinderella'. Shaughnessy is survived by his son, Dan, and three grandchildren.Â
