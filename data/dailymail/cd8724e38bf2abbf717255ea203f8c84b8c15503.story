Sickening: More than 2,000 indecent images were found when police raided the home of Mike Davies, pictured, in Llantrisant, South Wales, last June

A former council worker who was caught with more than 2,000 indecent images of children received a  redundancy payout worth an estimated £30,000 after keeping his arrest secret from bosses.

A sickening collection of pictures of children as young as five being sexually abused was discovered when police raided the home of Mike Davies, in Llantrisant, South Wales, last June.

But the 52-year-old failed to tell his then-employers, Cardiff City Council, about the criminal investigation and continued in his post until it was 'deleted' as part of budget savings this year. 

Davies, a long-serving council employee, admitted to possessing the images and videos, including sexual pictures involving animals, when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court on Wednesday.

He was handed a three-year community sentence and ordered to undertake a three-year therapy course to cure his 'weird obsessions'. He will also be on the Sex Offenders' Register for five years.

The explicit material, which included sexual images involving animals, were found on Davies' computer when police searched the home he shared with his partner and four-year-old child.

He has recently been living at an address in Caerphilly, South Wales. 

Today it emerged that senior council officials were only made aware of the proceedings after the conviction and that Davies received a severance package from the council as recently as last month.

Davies, who held a number of roles at the council, is likely to have received a payout of around £30,000 - the maximum amount available to an officer of his age, according to Wales Online.

The council is now taking legal advise on the matter and is 'considering what steps it can take going forward'.

A Cardiff City Council spokesman said: 'Mr Davies' post was deleted as part of this year's budget savings. 

'We want to reiterate in the strongest terms that senior management was unaware of any criminal proceedings against him until the day of his conviction.

'The organisation is appalled that Mr Davies failed to reveal the criminal investigation to the council at any point.

'The City of Cardiff Council is taking legal advice on this matter and considering what steps it can take going forward.'

Assistant Chief Constable Richard Lewis said: 'South Wales Police is required to comply with existing data protection legislation when it investigates any case and is not allowed to disclose to an employer when a person has been arrested or charged with a criminal offence.

'The exception is if the role is a notifiable occupation, which it wasn't in this case.

'While South Wales Police is committed to protecting its communities from sex offenders the force also has to adhere to its legal obligations under the existing legislation.

'This was a particularly unpleasant case which was thoroughly investi-gated by South Wales Police, resulting in Mr Davies appearing before the courts.

'Cases of this nature are extremely serious and for every child abuse image there is a victim.'
