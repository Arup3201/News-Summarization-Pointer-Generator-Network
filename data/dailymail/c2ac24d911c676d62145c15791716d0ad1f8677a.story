A convicted murderer who was given a lethal injection for the brutal killing of a special education teacher sang for a minute after receiving his fatal dose before he was pronounced dead.

Walter Timothy Storey, 47, died nine minutes after receiving the lethal drug at 12.01am on Wednesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri.

In a final statement, Storey said: 'For this world full of anger, hate and revenge, I would like to pray for peace, forgiveness and love! I love everyone, even those who are doing this deed.'  

Convicted murderer Walter Timothy Storey (pictured left  in 2012 and right in his 1990 arrest photo) died on Wednesday at 12.10am, nine minutes after receiving lethal injection in Bonne Terre, Missouri

On February 2 1990, a drunk Storey, then 22, broke into an apartment next door to his mother's home in St Charles, where he was living, to steal money for more beer. 

Jill Frey, a 36-year-old special education teacher, had left the sliding glass door on to her balcony open.

Storey confronted Miss Frey in her bedroom and viciously beat her, leaving the woman with six broken ribs and severe head and facial wounds.

He used a kitchen knife to slit her throat so deeply that her spine was damaged. Miss Frey died of blood loss and asphyxiation.

The killer then returned the next day to clean up blood, throw clothes in a trash bin and scrub Miss Frey's fingernails to remove any traces of his skin.

The 36-year-old's body was discovered after she failed to report for work on Monday morning.

However Storey failed to spot a key piece of evidence: blood on a dresser.

'There was a really good palm print in blood,' said Mike Harvey, a retired St. Charles detective who now works as an investigator for the St. Charles County prosecutor.

Lab analysis matched the print to Storey, whose prints were on file for a previous crime.

The St Louis-Dispatch reported that the victim's brother, Jeff Frey, was among the 14 people who watched Storey die.

He read a statement which said: 'This guy had no mercy on Jill but now we are expected to have mercy on him.'

His sister had dedicated her life to helping children with special needs, Mr Frey said, adding: 'To say Jill was a special person is an understatement.'

He said that waiting 25 years to watch Storey executed had been excruciating for Jill's loved ones and that her parents had passed away before they could see their daughter's killer die.

Storey claimed that he had been upset over his pending divorce when he killed Miss Frey. 

Storey was convicted and sentenced to death.

He was executed on Wednesday after losing an 11th hour-appeal to the Supreme Court on grounds that the lethal injection could cause a painful death. 

Missouri obtains execution drug, pentobarbital, from an unnamed compounding pharmacy, and prison officials refused to disclose details about how or if it has been tested.

Storey's attorney argued that the secrecy made it impossible to know if the barbiturate would work quickly or cause an unconstitutionally painful death.

The U.S. Supreme Court and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon denied appeals to spare his life.

It was Missouri's first execution of the year after the state executed a record ten inmates in 2014.     

Last month, the Supreme Court put three executions in Oklahoma on hold until a decision is reached on the method of lethal injection used. 

Storey was sentenced to death three separate times in the case.

The Missouri Supreme Court tossed the murder conviction the first time, citing concerns about ineffective assistance of counsel and 'egregious' errors committed by Kenny Hulshof, who was with the Missouri attorney general's office at the time and handled the prosecution. 

Mr Hulshof was later a congressman and a candidate for governor.

Storey was tried again in 1997, and sentenced again to death. That conviction was also overturned, due to a procedural error by the judge. 

Storey was sentenced to death a third time in 1999.

Storey's lawyer had said he was remorseful for his crimes and had spent 'thousands of hours' working in a restorative justice program in prison, trying to help crime victims.

U.S. states have executed seven people so far in 2015 after putting 35 inmates to death last year., according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Missouri will change its time for executions from midnight to 6pm starting with the next scheduled execution in March, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch. 

A local anti-death penalty group held a vigil on Tuesday night into Wednesday morning in Springfield, the state capital.
