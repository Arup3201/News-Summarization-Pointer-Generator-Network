A paedophile teacher drugged and molested up to 60 boys as young as ten at a British private school after four decades spent abusing children around the globe.

William Vahey, 64, plied them with sleeping pills before carrying out his sickening attacks during class trips abroad, it emerged last night.

The married teacher appeared to have an ‘immaculate record’ when he started work at the elite Southbank International School in 2009. In reality, he had covered up a child sex conviction and spent 40 years abusing ‘hundreds’ of youngsters in nine countries.

Vahey
 committed suicide at a motel in the US last month – just days after 
confessing. The FBI had been poised to investigate a USB memory stick 
containing graphic images of 90 children who appeared to be asleep or 
unconscious while they were assaulted during field trips dating back to 
2008.

The photos featured between 50 and 60 pupils at Southbank 
International in central London, where American-born Vahey taught ten to
 16-year-olds history and geography and led trips to destinations such 
as Nepal and Venezuela.

Last night, distraught parents at the 
prestigious school favoured by foreign executives feared they may never 
know whether their children were abused because the victims had been secretly fed sedatives beforehand.

Sir
 Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools and chairman of 
governors at Southbank International, described the case as ‘the worst 
thing that I’ve ever been involved in in 40 years of education’.

Scotland Yard is now trying to formally identify Vahey’s victims, all boys aged between ten and 14. Southbank
 International, which has 758 pupils and charges fees of £25,000 a year,
 revealed Vahey had been investigated over a previous ‘incident’ during 
his time at the school. But it claimed it was not pursued at the request
 of both parents and child.

Vahey
 underwent a Criminal Records Bureau check when he was taken on and 
another three years later.

Both gave him the all-clear even though he 
had a child sex conviction in California dating back to 1969.

The father
 of two – who lived in a stunning £1.8million Georgian property in Maida
 Vale, west London, with his 66-year-old wife Jean – was highly 
respected in the private education community.

But unbeknown to teachers 
and parents, he had spent years hiding his conviction and did not sign 
the sex offenders register in the US.

Last
 night FBI investigators described his sordid activities as ‘one of the 
most prolific and heinous suspected sexual predator cases we have ever 
seen’.

Sir Chris said he felt physically sick at the abuse. He said 
it ‘beggars belief’ that Vahey was able to teach in the UK and at other 
schools in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Madrid, Athens, Venezuela, Iran and 
Lebanon despite his conviction.

Yesterday, parents said they felt ‘upset and betrayed’.

One
 mother whose son went on a field trip with the pervert said: ‘I 
couldn’t sleep last night. I am shocked, very shocked. My boy is 13 now 
and his class teacher was Vahey. Even if they find my son in the photos,
 I would rather not know and just forget about it.

‘My son is very 
worried. He asked me “did I get molested?”.’ Another mother said: ‘Every
 teenage kid who went on those trips is asking, “Was it me?” They are 
scared and distraught, can’t believe it’s true, don’t want it  to be 
true.’

Vahey, who left Southbank International last year, was only 
caught after a housekeeper at a school he moved to in Nicaragua stole a 
memory stick containing the vile images. She was sacked, but months 
later went back to school administrators after viewing the USB stick and
 finding images of Vahey and sleeping nude  teenage boys.

Life of crime: William James Vahey (pictured left in 1995 and right in 1986). He confessed to a colleague in Nicaragua that he had been molesting young boys for his entire life, the FBI said

The photos 
were catalogued with dates and locations that corresponded with 
overnight field trips that Vahey had taken with students since 2008.

When confronted, he confessed to using sleeping pills to abuse boys throughout his life.

Unremorseful, he said: ‘I was molested as a boy – that is why I do this. I have been doing this my whole life.’ 

Vahey's career included posts at:

The 
Tehran American School in Iran from 1972-73

The American Community 
School of Beirut in Lebanon, 1973-75

The American School of Madrid in 
Spain, 1975-76

The Passargad School in Ahwaz, Iran, 1976-78

The 
American Community School in Athens, Greece, 1978-80

The Saudi Aramco 
Schools in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 1980-92

The Jakarta International 
School in Indonesia, 1992-2002

The Escuela Campo Alegre in Caracas, 
Venezuela, 2002-09

The Southbank International School in London, 
2009-2013

According
 to an affidavit filed at the federal courthouse in Houston, Texas, 
Vahey insisted that he ‘never hurt’ any of the boys and that they did 
not even know what had happened to them because they were asleep.

But
 two days after the FBI filed a warrant to examine the memory stick, 
Vahey killed himself at the motel in Luverne, Minnesota.

FBI Special
 Agent Shauna Dunlap said: ‘It appears he was able to perfect his craft 
in such a way these children were unable to know what happened to them 
and unable to report it.

‘It is fair to assume there are many victims. The figure could be in the hundreds.’

Graham
 Lacey, executive principal at Southbank International, said Vahey was 
subject to a CRB check when he joined the school, which revealed nothing
 untoward.

A second check three years later produced the same result and
 three references  the school obtained were ‘outstanding’.

Yesterday, Mr Lacey confirmed that 50 to 60 pupils had fallen victim to the predator.

He
 wrote to parents: ‘This disclosure which we learned this morning, left 
us all appalled. As staff we feel upset, angry and betrayed. We can only
 imagine what you as parents must feel.’

He described Vahey as an 
‘extremely popular teacher’ but admitted that ‘rumours were in fact 
circulating amongst students and parents’. He added: ‘There are perhaps 
lessons here to be learnt.’

Mr Lacey said there had been an incident
 involving the teacher which was investigated at the time, but the 
parents and child did not want to pursue it.

Pupils are being offered
 counselling and a meeting for parents is due to be held next week.  A 
spokesman for Scotland Yard said last night: ‘We are liaising with the 
school to ensure that any potential victims who  come forward receive 
the necessary support.’
