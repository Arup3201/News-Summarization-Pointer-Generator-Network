Sisters, who recently lost their beloved mother to cancer, were ejected from a Philadelphia shopping mall on Sunday after refusing to remove profanity-laden hats expressing their hatred of breast cancer.

Jackie Underwood passed away on May 14, she had first battled cancer in 2004 before it returned in 2011.

In the time leading up to her death, her daughters Makia Underwood, 32, Zakia Clark, 29, and Tasha Clark, 27 had worn hats and shirts featuring the expression ‘F**k cancer’ as a show of support.

The women, who nursed their mom through her final days, actually designed and produced the clothing to raise money for cancer awareness.

On Sunday, the three sisters visited the King of Prussia Mall in the Upper Merion Township, with a group of friends and relatives to pick out a dress for Zakia's 9-year-old daughter to wear to her grandmother's funeral on 22 May.

Zakia and Tasha decided to wear their ‘F**k cancer’ hats which include a pink ribbon substituting for the third letter of the first word. Zakia said it is the only word strong enough to defeat the word 'cancer.'

After several hours of shopping, several members of the group including Zakia and Tasha decided to get some food.

As they were eating, the ladies were approached by a security guard who told them to remove their hats because they were offensive.

Zakia instinctively took hers off, but Tasha, who had once worked at the mall, told the guard she wanted to see something in writing.

Her brave stance prompted her sister to put her own hat back on.

‘He said, “Since you don't want to take your hat off, you can leave my mall,'" Zakia told Philly.com. ‘He stood there while we ate and threatened to call the cops.’

The ladies say seven more guards appeared and surrounded them, scaring Zakia’s daughter who started to cry.

The group was then escorted to the mall office, where they were met by a local police officer who had been called by security guards.

‘The officer said, “I find it offensive that you even have that hat that says 'F**k cancer'" Zakia said. "He said, 'It's their mall, they want you out, you have to get out.'"

The ladies objected, pointing out that stores at 
the mall, such as Urban Outfitters, sell t-shirts featuring similar 
language, but they were then escorted from the premises.

Mall manager Robert Hart has since apologized for his staff's heavy-handed behavior.

He sent his condolences to the sisters, but noted that since the mall is a family place their code of conduct doesn't tolerate profanity.

He also promised to make a donation to a cancer charity of their choice.
