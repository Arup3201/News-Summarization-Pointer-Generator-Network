A set of pictures taken by a cunning photographer and his brother have captured the younger sibling in action as he 'flies' over a picturesque Scottish Loch.

Alan Stewart, nicknamed 'Superboy', came up with the clever stunt while playing on his trampoline at home.

The 11-year-old was bouncing on the trampoline when his brother happened to be experimenting with the camera on his new iPhone.

When a perfectly timed photo - taken as Alan was in mid air - gave off the impression he was flying, the two set to work to create a whole set of  trick photographs.

After the success of the first photo, the 11-year-old went on to appear in a number of different poses

Superboy: Alan's flying pose is all the more effective because of the landscape captured behind him

The photographs were taken by his older brother David, who was playing around with his camera phone

His father, also called Alan, from Loch Striven, Argyll and Bute, said: 'I'm stunned. He caught that just right. I'm actually really jealous.'

The 58-year-old added: 'I like to take a lot of photos but unfortunately, I just can't take credit for this one.'

Alan's older brother David, 32, said: 'I was playing around with the camera on my new phone and taking pictures of Alan on the trampoline.

'He was just messing around but the shots came out really well. He's really chuffed with them.'
