She is the daughter of self-made millionaires, sister to a duchess and related to the Royal family by marriage.

So we wouldn't expect dear old Pippa Middleton to walk around with her bits and pieces in a Sainsbury's carrier bag.

And on Monday, as befits her status as socialite, celebutante and sister to the future Queen of England (not to mention the likelihood she'll end up married to a blue blood herself), the younger Middleton sister stepped out with a rather luxe bit of arm candy.

The stylish specimen was the £795 Marylebone tote by luxury leather goods brand Aspinal.

Billed as an 'arm candy favourite' British brand Aspinal calls the bag 'luxuriously chic and sophisticated', adding that it is a 'definitive trans-seasonal wardrobe classic.'

Pippa
 paired the bag, made of the finest Italian calfskin and lined in 
grosgrain silk, with a pair of dark indigo Paige jeans,
 a nautical jumper last seen when she went sailing with Ben Ainslie, and
 a pair of £150 suede boots by Somerset brand Seven Boot Lane, an 
independent company who source their boots from one of Spain's most 
traditional footwear factories.

Pippa,
 who last week confessed to Vanity Fair that she had a crush on rugby 
players Will Carling and Jonny Wilkinson when she was a teenager, wore the chic get-up - which she had worn last week albeit with a different jumper - for an afternoon shopping in London .

Sell out! Pippa's bag on the Aspinal website - but bad luck if you want to buy one as the version Pippa has - the Monochrome Saffiano - is out of stock
