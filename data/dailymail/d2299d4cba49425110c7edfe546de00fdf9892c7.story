Streaming movies at home is cheaper than going to the cinema, but that may soon change. 

Cable and pay-TV companies are trying to find the best ways to profit from the rising demand of Internet bandwidth, in large part because of Netflix and Hulu.

Some, including giant Time Warner Cable, are on the brink of imposing new fees based on data usage.

So long, cheap streaming? Companies like Time Warner are eyeing usage-based payment models

Analyst Craig Moffett of Sanford C. Bernstein and Company in New York said companies like Cox Communications, Charter Communications, or Time Warner could be the first to start charging for the amount of data users consume on the internet, not just bandwidth.

‘As more video shifts to the Web, the cable operators will inevitably align their pricing models,’ Mr Moffett told the Chronicle.

‘With the right usage-based pricing plan, they can embrace the transition instead of resisting it.’

The San Francisco Chronicle reports that high definition offerings on websites like Netflix and Hulu eat up large amounts of data.

Netflix creates 32 per cent of peak downstream traffic, according to the 2011 Sandvine Internet Phenomena Report released in October of this year and their streaming video is responsible for nearly 28 per cent of all bandwidth usage nationally.

Usage-based pricing is hardly a new idea. U.S. providers have for years debated whether or not to switch to the model in order to gain more profits from increased Web use.

According to the Chronicle, these fees may very well become a permanent fixture in customer’s monthly bills.

Dish Network chairman Charlie Ergen warned that Netflix subscriptions could again inflate. ‘That Netflix subscription of $7.99 could go to an extra $20 a month for bit streaming,’ he said.

Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey said increasing broadband prices was ‘not in the consumer’s best interest as consumers deserve unfettered access to a robust Internet at reasonable rates.’

Netflix customers have already received largely unwelcome news this year, when the company announced it would split its subscriptions.

Rather than offering mailed DVDs and streaming together, the two were only offered separately, and at higher prices.

The model has already taken part in some inception in Dallas, Texas, where AT&T charges DSL customers who exceed a monthly limited of 150GB an extra $10 for every 50GB of data they use.

Not every household will consume that kind of data. 

Comcast generally offers users 250GB per month, which allows 60 standard definition movies to be streamed and 12,000 emails to be sent and received. 

In December, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski supported publically a usage-based pricing model.
