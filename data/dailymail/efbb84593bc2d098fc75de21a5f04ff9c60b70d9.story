Potential features for HTC’s next flagship phone, dubbed Hima or HTC One M9, have emerged following a series of online leaks.

The phone is thought to include an impressive 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and a 5-inch screen. 

The leaks also suggest the next-generation device will include 3GB of RAM, run the latest version of Android, and feature a 20.7MP rear-facing camera.

The details emerged after Twitter user, @upleaks, released a screenshot of the AnTuTu benchmark site showing a HTC device named HTC6535LVW (Hima), thought to be the One M9 (pictured)

This would make the device similar, in terms of memory, to the LTE-A edition of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and in terms of features to the HTC One M8 Prime.  

According to the AnTuTu benchmark testing site, Hima will have a 5-inch screen, with a resolution of 1920 x 1080, rather than the previously rumoured Quad HD (2560 x 1440).

The handset is also rumoured to have two cameras with the rear one featuring 20.7MP, while a 13MP camera will be included on the front.

A separate leak from Steve Hemmerstoffer from Nowhere Else shows an alleged CES press shot of the phone, without the front-facing speakers of HTC's last two flagship smartphones. This has led to reports that the device may launch at the electronics show in Las Vegas next week

Photos that leaked on Zol.com.cn suggest the phone may have an aluminum silicon-carbide based body. The handset is also rumoured to have two cameras with a rear-facing 20.7MP, and a 13MP camera on the front

The phone, it is claimed, will also have Android 5.1 Lollipop pre-installed.

It is suggested that the phone will launch during next week's CES event in Las Vegas, although some sites argue HTC’s history points to a springtime release.

‘We're less convinced by the latest posted by Steve Hemmerstoffer on his Twitter feed,’ wrote Pocket Lint.

‘It just doesn't seem right to us, especially the HTC logo at the bottom, although that might just be the new style for the Desire.’

A set of photos that leaked on Zol.com.cn suggest the phone may additionally have an aluminum silicon-carbide based body.

AndroidJS graphic designer Jermaine Smit, meanwhile, has created his concept of what a new One M9 might look like, this time including front-facing speakers.

His concept includes a 2K screen, Snapdragon 808 CPU running at 2.8GHz, and 3GB of RAM.

The phone, it is claimed, will also have Android 5.1 Lollipop pre-installed. Pictured is the current HTC One M8

The leaks also suggest the Taiwanese group will include 3GB of RAM – a similar amount of memory to the LTE-A edition of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (pictured)
