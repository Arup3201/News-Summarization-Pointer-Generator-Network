Celebrity Big Brother star White Dee has been forced to leave her Benefits Street home after her children suffered racial abuse and were called 'a bag of liquorice allsorts'.

The mother-of-two, 43, who shot to fame on Channel Four's controversial documentary about James Turner Street in Birmingham, has taken her family to a secret location.

Dee – real name Deidre Kelly - said Twitter and Facebook trolls called her mixed race children Caitlin, 16, and Gerrard, seven, 'liquorice allsorts' because they are different colours.

White Dee - real name Deidre Kelly - has been forced to leave her home in James Turner Street, Birmingham. She said her children, Caitlin, 16, (pictured) and Gerrard, seven, suffered racial abuse

'I can deal with just about anything but when people bring the colour of my children's skin into it, that's when I get annoyed,' she told the Sunday Express.

'I was called a 'race mixing whore' by one person.

'And another said my kids are like a bag of liquorice allsorts because they're different colours.'

The welfare queen said she had to move for 'pure sanity' because of the escalating abuse.

'You get a lot of racist comments on Twitter and Facebook. Those kinds of people would never dare say it to my face,' she said.

After the Channel Four documentary aired, hysterical fans camped outside White Dee's house

'For pure sanity, we've had to move. It was for the children's sake more than anything.

'I need some quiet time with my kids. I've had to do it.'

The children were taken to Wales for two weeks while Dee was in the Big Brother house.

Manager Barry Tomes said: 'In the run-up to Celebrity Big Brother we really noticed the abuse increasing. She was being called a 'fat slag' a lot and people even threw a brick through her window.'

The TV star is now living with 44-year-old Mark Wilson, who she has been with for around six months.

During her time in the Celebrity Big Brother house Dee clashed repeatedly with Gary Busey, 70, pushing her to the verge of a 'nervous breakdown'.

She was voted out of the TV programme on Friday night, coming in joint fifth place with Edele Lynch.   

Dee told fellow TV housemates that she had stopped claiming benefits in March after declaring her income.

Her manager confirmed that Dee will be staying in Birmingham as she did not want the children to move schools.
