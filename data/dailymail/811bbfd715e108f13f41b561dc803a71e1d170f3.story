A 14-year-old Florida boy had been bullied for years leading up to his Wednesday night suicide said an attorney for his family.

Attorney Matt Morgan said the 14-year-old boy who committed suicide Wednesday had long been the victim of bullying

The Greenwood Lakes Middle School student had been 'a small child due to health complications at an early age,' attorney Matt Morgan told reporters.

'This made him an easy target for cruel and mean-spirited bullies,' he added.

Morgan told ClickOrlando that the boy's history of being bullied in New York was one reason the family moved to Florida.

But the torture continued until this week's tragedy.

'The conduct of these bullies is morally reprehensible,' Morgan said. 'Bullying has become an epidemic in our country which needs to be 
recognized and acted upon.'

A news conference to further address the death will be held at 9 a.m. Monday.

Those gathered will include Tricia Norman, who's daughter Rebecca Sedwick killed herself after being bullied.

The 14-year-old boy was discovered dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a middle school bathroom Wednesday night.

According
 to Seminole County Sheriff's Office, the child's mother drove to 
Greenwood Lakes Middle School in Lake Mary to pick up her son at around 
5pm, but could not find him.

The
 boy's family then set out scouring the neighborhood for him, but to no 
avail. Two hours later, the 14-year-old was reported missing to police.

Sheriff's 
deputies were dispatched to Greenwood Lakes Middle School to search the 
campus, where they eventually came upon the missing boy, who was found 
in a men's room stall with a bullet wound to the head.

The grisly discovery was made four hours after the middle-schooler was reported missing by his mother, WESH-TV reported. 

Greenwood
 Lakes Principal Debra Abbott released a statement on the school’s 
website and Facebook page announcing the student’s death.

‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the parents and family of the student as they deal with this tremendous personal loss.

‘Grief
 Counselors will be available on-site for students and staff beginning 
first thing this morning and will remain for as long as necessary,’ the 
open letter read.

Tragic find: A 14-year-old boy attending Greenwood Lakes Middle School in Lake Mary, Florida, was discovered dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a bathroom stall on campus

Police are now trying to determine how the teenager got his hands on a firearm. His name has not been released to the public.

Channel 9 reported that it has been suggested that the boy might have been bullied, but the investigation into a possible motive is ongoing.

Classes resumed as normal Thursday, but the school canceled its open house scheduled for the evening, along with all after-school activities.

Parent Nadine Weaver told Orlando Sentinel that after hearing the tragic news of the boy’s death this morning, she rushed to Greenwood Lakes and pulled her daughter from class early.

‘I hate for her to miss another day of school but I just can't help it,’ Weaver said. ‘It could be someone that she knows personally, and how could I be at home [and] leave her here, just not knowing.’
