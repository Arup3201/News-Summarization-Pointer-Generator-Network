Everyone from Kim Kardashian and Margot Robbie to Rosamund Pike and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini have chopped off their long locks recently, making shorter hair a bona fide trend.

But the rise in these shorter haircuts isn't just down to their flattering face-framing effects.

According to the Sunday Times, the growing popularity of shorter haircuts is also sign of economic recovery, since they require more frequent trips to the salon and are therefore more pricey to maintain.

Celebrity hairdresser Stuart Phillips, whose clients have included Serena Williams and Jamie Oliver, told the newspaper that he believes shorter hairdos are a sure sign that the economy is bouncing back. 

He said: 'Products are flying off the shelf, more than they used to even a few months ago.'

And it's not just the fact that shorter styles require more sprays and gels.

The upkeep of a lob (long bob) or pixie crop is also time-consuming, with some women having to visit the salon every four to six weeks to maintain the look.

Jourdan Dunn (left, in July 2014) made waves when she got her chin-length lob (right, in February 2015)

Kristen Stewart transformed her long auburn locks (left, in May 2014) to an equally daring short style (right, in February 2015)

By contrast, women with longer hair can leave it a few months before going in to top up their trims.

'With short hair you need to keep it in shape,' explained Mr Phillips. 'With long hair, a lot of women tend to leave it months on end.'

Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, who is the face of L'Oreal, debuted her new layered bob just last week on the Graham Norton Show.

And Aussie actress Margot Robbie chose the Oscars to show off her new shorter blonde look. 

A-list trends may not be the best indication of a pattern in the real world, but according to hairdresser Drew Foster, who owns Foster Hair & Beauty in London's Shoreditch neighbourhood, non-famous women are also following suit.

Sienna Miller traded in her hippie-chic long waves (left, in March 2014) for a side-swept lob (right, in January)

Scarlett Johansson had longer locks in March 2014 (left). But now, she has a very edgy pixie cut (right, February)

'Girls are going shorter,' he told the MailOnline, adding that his salon charges about £48 for a bob, with women tending to come in every six weeks to maintain the style.

But Mr Foster feels that the trend is more a sign of modernity than of economic change, since women  visit salons even during a recession because they see it as a way of treating themselves.

In any case, he says he's definitely a fan of the new It-style. 

He said: 'It used to be that girls had long hair and men had short. 

'Finally it's 2015 and things have shifted - and I think that's very exciting.'

It's not just hair that gets shorter during a recovery - rising hemlines are also an indication that the economy is on the up.

And judging by this year's London Fashion Week shows, where labels including Topshop, Julien Macdonald and Giles showcased leg-baring A-line minis, it's a trend that is here to stay.
