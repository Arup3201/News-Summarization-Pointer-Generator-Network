Police have arrested a second suspect in the rape of a five-year-old girl in India, who officers say was left for dead in a locked room.

Pradeep Kumar, a 19-year-old clothes factory worker, was arrested today in the eastern state of Bihar, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from New Delhi.

New Delhi police said he was now being brought to the capital.

Police said questioning of the first man arrested in the case on Saturday, Manoj Kumar, led them to the second suspect.

Manoj Kumar, 24, was arrested on Saturday in Bihar and flown back to New Delhi. Kumar is a common last name in India and the two men are not related.

The men are accused of abducting, raping and attempting to murder the five-year-old, who went missing April 15 and was found two days later by neighbours who heard her crying in a locked room in the same New Delhi building where she lives with her family.

The girl was alone when she was found, having been left for dead by her attackers, police said.

The girl was in critical condition when she was transferred on Thursday from a local hospital to the largest government-run hospital in the country.

D.K. Sharma, medical superintendent of the hospital in New Delhi where the girl was being treated, said she was responding well to treatment and that her condition had stabilised.

'She is much better today and her wounds are healing well,' Sharma told reporters. 

It coincides with angry protests 
across the capital, where demonstrators clashed with police as anger 
grows over how authorities handle such cases.

The attack came four months after the fatal gang rape of a woman on a New Delhi bus sparked outrage across India about the treatment of women in the country.

For the third consecutive day, sporadic protests erupted in at least three places in New Delhi.

Scores of supporters of the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party dodged a huge police cordon and managed to reach the gates of Parliament where they shouted slogans against the Delhi police's handling of the case.

About 100 BJP supporters were detained.

Police said they would be held at a nearby police station and then released in a few hours.

Shocking: Today's demonstrations in New Delhi follow the kidnap, rape and torture of a five-year-old girl

Separately, about 100 women protested
at another area near the Parliament building. Most of the protests were
directed against the Delhi police officers who failed to act after the 
girl's parents told them she was missing.

The
protesters have demanded that the Delhi police chief be removed from 
office and that police accused of failing to act on the parents' 
complaint be dismissed.

'The
police must be held accountable for their shocking levels of apathy. 
They urgently need to review police processes to ensure that all cases 
of rape and sexual violence - not just those highlighted by the media - 
are fully and promptly investigated,' said G. Ananthapadmanabhan, who 
heads the India chapter of the human rights group Amnesty International.

'Those who fail to do their job must be held accountable,' he said.

Delhi police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar today admitted police had made mistakes in the handling the case.

'There have been shortfalls, so the station house officer and his deputy have been suspended,' Kumar told reporters.

However,
he said that instructions given to police officers since the December 
gang rape case to report all complaints of rape and molestation had led 
to a 'phenomenal rise' in the number of such cases registered in the 
city.

'This shows that
the tendency earlier to dissuade women from getting their complaints 
registered has changed dramatically,' he said.

Calls for change: There have been a number of high-profiled cases of sexual abuse in India

Demands: Protesters were demanding the government ensure the safety and women and girls in the capital

He said the number of rape and molestation cases that police were able to solve and make arrests had also gone up drastically.

Despite
the police chief's claims of tighter enforcement, sexual crimes against
women and children are reported every day in Indian newspapers, and 
women often complain about feeling insecure when they leave their homes.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called for changes in attitudes toward women in India.

'The
gruesome assault on the little girl a few days back reminds us once 
again of the need to work collectively to root out this sort of 
depravity from our society,' Singh said at a meeting on Sunday with 
civil servants.

The 
December gang rape on the New Delhi bus sparked outrage and spurred the 
government to pass tough laws for crimes against women, including the 
death penalty for repeat offenders or for rape attacks that lead to the 
victim's death.

Activists
say passing strong laws is not enough, and that the government must 
ensure that police and the justice system crack down on crimes against 
women.

'Mere changes in the law are not enough. Robust implementation is essential,' Ananthapadmanabhan said.

The Telegraph reported that Bharatiya Janata Party leader, Ms Swaraj, left the hospital after seeing the young victim, and said: 'I saw another five year old girl child in the next room.

'She is also a rape victim. She was found abandoned in the AIIMS Campus. She says her father is a Rickshaw puller. She misses her mother but does not want to go home.

'Doctors told me that only few days back, they discharged a male child who was a victim of sodomy. I think we should hang these criminals and save our children.'

An 11-year-old girl is also being treated at the hospital, having suffered serious internal injuries when she was gang-raped last August.
