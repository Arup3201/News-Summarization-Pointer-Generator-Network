It happened in the blink of an eye on the Interstate in New Jersey.

A driver who slowed down because of an accident directly ahead of him ended up capturing footage of a crash that barely missed his own car.

'I was blocked by two trucks on south bound I-95 at exit 9 in New Jersey. I only wanted to take a picture while I was awaiting for them to clear up... And then I heard noise from behind... I was barely missed.' 

Seconds from disaster: A man who took out his camera to take a picture of a crash along Interstate 95 in New Jersey Sunday remained incredibly cool as an out-of-control big rig approached from behind

Close call: 'I only wanted to take a picture while I was awaiting for them to clear up. And then I heard noise from behind. I was barely missed' the man wrote on YouTube

Slippy: The big-rig can be seen careening out of control on black ice that coated the Interstate 

Caught on camera: The driver in the car remained incredibly calm as the truck skirted on by

The man says it was only after hearing a noise coming from behind that he saw the big rig sliding on the slick road.

It came within feet of taking out his car before it went over a guardrail and landed in the express lanes of the southbound side.

The crash happened on Sunday after freezing rain and snow glazed roads across the Northeast, leaving as many as six dead.

'Once I turned off camera, I called in 911 and reported the accident. 

'After that I came to the truck and the rest of the cars to verify they were alright. After arrival of the New Jersey State Trooper, he dismissed me confirming that he did not require my presence and I left the scene,' the man wrote on YouTube. 

No protection: The guard rail did nothing to stop the big-rig from going straight over the top

At rest: The drama was all over in a matter of seconds but the frightening experience was all caught on camera
