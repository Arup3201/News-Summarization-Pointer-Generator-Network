U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Bashar al-Assad 'a two-bit dictator' on Monday during an hour-long conference call with Democratic congressmen - saying Syria's president will 'continue to act with impunity' if President Obama's request for limited air strikes fails to win approval.

And speaking to reporters after a meeting with President Obama at the White House, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona said that if Congress defeats a resolution calling for military intervention, it would be 'catastrophic, because it would undermine the credibility of the United States and the president of the United States.'

South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who joined McCain and Obama on Monday afternoon, called Syria ‘a cancer that's growing in the region' and said Republicans 'don't want endless war... We want sustainable security.’

About 125 of the House's 200 Democrats were on the call with Kerry, a Democratic aide told MailOnline. Lawmakers also heard from National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Director of National intelligence James Clapper.

A Democratic staff source said Kerry referred repeatedly to a 'Munich moment' faced by the United States, referring to the September 30, 1938 Munich Pact. That agreement, signed by Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Neville Chamberlain and French premier Edouard Daladier, essentially ceded Czechoslovakia to Germany in hopes of securing peace.

Politico reported Monday that Kerry assured legislators that Israel supports the concept of a U.S. military strike on Syria.

The Democratic aide also said Minnesota Rep. Rick Nolan openly challenged Kerry on the nature of the Obama administration's evidence that the Assad regime had used sarin gas against rebels inside Syria. 

'This is going to be another Vietnam,' Nolan reportedly said. 'I don't want to hear any talk like that,' the source said Kerry snapped back.

Kerry served in Vietnam as captain of a naval 'swift boat' whose other crewmen challenged the basis for his service medals when he ran for president in 2004.

The secretary of state also famously served as chief spokesman for Vietnam Veterans Against the War, testifying against U.S. military involvement there during a 1971 hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

'There is nothing in South Vietnam which could happen that realistically threatens the United States of America,' Kerry said then.

'And to attempt to justify the loss of one American life in Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos by linking such loss to the preservation of freedom, which those misfits supposedly abuse, is to us the height of criminal hypocrisy, and it is that kind of hypocrisy which we feel has torn this country apart.'

Kerry later served as chairman of that committee, and it voted to approve his nomination to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state earlier this year.

On Tuesday he will return, along with Hagel, to testify publicly in the latest salvo of the public relations war over U.S. involvement in Syria.

The 2:30 p.m. event will be the first in a series of hearings in advance of congressional votes on a resolution endorsing military intervention in the war-torn country.

Political insiders see the hearing as one piece of a White House public persuasion effort, which included Monday's conference call.

Kerry and Hagel will return on Wednesday morning for a 9:00 a.m. closed-door briefing with the same Senate panel, suggesting that Tuesday's public hearing will be only a partial display of the Obama administration's case for air strikes and other military action.

Three hours later, Kerry will appear before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs to make a similar case. 

California GOP Rep. Ed Royce, who chairs the committee, said Monday afternoon that 'the president's proposed military response to the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime demands thorough and deliberate congressional consideration.’

'This hearing will allow for the Administration to publicly make its case and explain its plans to Congress and the American people.'

The White House’s PR campaign will also include calls from the White House to pivotal members of the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle, following the in-person meeting Monday with McCain and Graham, two influential Republicans whom Obama has won over.

'In all calls and briefings,' an Obama administration aide told The Hill, 'we will be making the same fundamental case: the failure to take action against Assad unravels the deterrent impact of the international norm against chemical weapons use, and it risks emboldening Assad and his key allies – Hezbollah and Iran – who will see that there are no consequences for such a flagrant violation of an international norm.'

Obama himself will travel to Sweden on Tuesday night, but not before meeting at the White House with the chairmen and ranking minority members of the intelligence, armed services and foreign affairs committees in tboth the House and Senate.
