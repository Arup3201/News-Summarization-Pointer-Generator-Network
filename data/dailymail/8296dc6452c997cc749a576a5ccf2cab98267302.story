Three daring Darwin men have been captured on film using their thongs to fight a grass fire caused by a firecracker on the Northern Territory’s annual day to set off fireworks across the state.

Laughter erupted from bemused onlookers as the bare foot men made the halfhearted attempt to put out the billowing blaze with one man encouraging them to ‘keep going for it’ while fireworks can be heard going off in the background.

The footage shows another man using the garden hose in an attempt to control the fire before a fire engine turns up to save the day, and a fireman extinguishes the blaze with a hose from the truck.

Bushfires NT director Mark Ashley describes the attempts by the men as inappropriate

A Northern Territory Fire and Rescue spokeswoman told MailOnline she was not aware of the incident but there were 70 incidents that firefighters had been called out to that night.

‘I was down there in amongst it and there were a lot of people doing a lot of strange things, so I’m not really surprised, although it hasn’t been brought to our attention,’ she said.

More firecrackers wreaked havoc in Stuart Park with a boat catching alight and at Bees Creek where a firecracker torpedoed into a hayshed and burnt it down.

Despite these dramatic scenes, authorities were impressed with the behaviour of most Territorians on the only day of the year when it is legal for locals to let off firecrackers as part of the Territory Day celebrations.

Bushfires NT director Mark Ashley had expected 30 to 50 significant fires, however  there was just one main incident where 100 hectares were burned at Acacia Gap, but wasn’t a threat to homes or people, and just nine fires in total.

Mr Ashley described the actions of the men who used their thongs as 'Inappropriate'.

He advised people should have a bucket of water nearby on firecracker night in case of a fire.

There have been 15 people so far who have turned up to emergency departments and clinics with fire cracker injuries, with most suffering burnt hands and fingers.

The most major incidents were when a 19 year-old woman was struck in the ear while another suffered burns to the neck.

The garden hose was put to use before the fire brigade turned up

Public Health Registrar Pasqualina Coffey said this was a significantly low number compared to last year with 25 – 35 incidents reported.

‘Although it varies from year to year – we have been monitoring it since 1998 and there seems to be no overall trend,’ she said.

But Ms Coffey said it was expected more people would come forward with injuries over the coming days as their condition worsened and possible further firecrackers being let off.

The men breath a sigh of relief as the Fire and Rescue service arrive on the scene
