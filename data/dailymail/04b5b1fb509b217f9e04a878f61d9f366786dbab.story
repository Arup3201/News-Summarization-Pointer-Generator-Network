CNN anchor and talk show host Anderson Cooper has publicly revealed he's gay for the first time

Anderson Cooper has thanked fans for their support after his decision to come out as gay.

The CNN news anchor was in Botswana filming when his sexuality was made public for the first time.

Cooper wrote on Twitter: 'I appreciate all the nice tweets. I am in Botswana working but want to wish everyone a great 4th of July!'

In an interview published yesterday, the journalist bluntly stated: 'The fact is, I'm gay'.

He said that he did not want people to think he is 'trying to hide something' and that he is 'proud' of who he is.

In candid comments he said that he was taking a stand because 'the tide of history only advances when people make themselves fully visible'.

The 45-year-old added he was moved by recent events such as Barack Obama's endorsement of gay marriage - and hopes his example will put an end to bullying.

Cooper's sexuality has long been an open secret in TV circles, but for him to state it publicly is a brave and bold move.

He is also one of the most high profile people to come out in recent years, given that he hosts CNN's 'Anderson Cooper 360' and his own daytime TV talk show.

Cooper came out by giving permission for friend  Andrew Sullivan, who is openly gay, to print an email exchange between them on the Daily Beast.

In it he said: 'The fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud.

'I have always been very open and honest about this part of my life with my friends, my family, and my colleagues.

Cooper has frequently been photographed with Benjamin Maisani, seen here shopping in the West Village with the news man in May 2010

'I love, and I am loved' he told Sullivan in the Monday letter. Here he and Benjamin ride bikes through New York city in July of 2010

'In a perfect world, I don't think it's anyone else's business, but I do think there is value in standing up and being counted.

'I'm not an activist, but I am a human being and I don't give that up by being a journalist.'

Anderson says he was distressed he may be giving the impression that he had something to hide, when in fact he has lived openly among family and friends

In the interview, Cooper added that he did not address his sexuality in his memoir which he wrote in 2006 because it was about war reporting and he 'didn't set out to write about other aspects of my life'.

He also long thought that being a 
journalist he should not become the story, so did not respond 'even when
I've been directly asked the 'gay question''.

What changed is that Cooper now worries that he could be setting a bad example by not being honest with the public.

He said: 'Recently I've begun to consider whether the unintended outcomes of maintaining my privacy outweigh personal and professional principle.

'It's become clear to me that by remaining silent on certain aspects of my personal life for so long, I have given some the mistaken impression that I am trying to hide something - something that makes me uncomfortable, ashamed or even afraid.

'This is distressing because it is simply not true.

'I've also been reminded recently that while as a society we are moving toward greater inclusion and equality for all people, the tide of history only advances when people make themselves fully visible.

Anderson, seen left in 1969 in Southampton, is the youngest son of Gloria Vanderbilt. Here is pictured with brother Carter, who committed suicide when he was 23

'There continue to be far too many 
incidences of bullying of young people, as well as discrimination and 
violence against people of all ages, based on their sexual orientation, 
and I believe there is value in making clear where I stand.'

Ellen DeGeneresI'm proud of you, @AndersonCooper.Don LemonCongratulations to @andersoncooper. We should all be supportive.Kelly RipaSo proud of you @andersoncooper .

Joan RiversThrilled @AndersonCooper came out! So, THAT’S why he never wanted to date me! I would’ve loved having Gloria Vanderbilt as my mother-in-law.

Jackie Collins Anderson Cooper. You rock!!!!

Kathy Griffin Here I am w/ my friend @andersoncooper who I'm so proud of. (Posting a photo)Neil Patrick Harris Good for you, @AndersonCooper. You're awesome.

Cooper's
comments appear to be a reference to the case of Tyler Clementi, the 
Rutgers University student who was spied on by his roommate whilst 
having sex with a man and then killed himself.

He
also suggested that Mr Obama's backing of gay marriage may have made a 
difference, as did the decision to allow gay couples in New York to 
marry.

Cooper said that on balance he came out 
because 'visibility is important, more important than preserving my 
reporter's shield of privacy'.

His going public will be old news to 
some, especially those who know him in New York where he has been a 
regular fixture at gay pride events for years.

Celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres, Don Lemon, Kelly Ripa and Joan Rivers took to Twitter today to show their support for Cooper.

Most people tweeted that they were proud of him for coming out or called him an inspiration.

Actor Kathy Griffin posted a photo of herself and Cooper holding hands while sunbathing and said 'Here I am w/ my friend @andersoncooper who I'm so proud of.'

Joan Rivers tweeted: 'Thrilled @AndersonCooper came out! So, 
THAT’S why he never wanted to date me! I would’ve loved having Gloria 
Vanderbilt as my mother-in-law.'

Cooper is said to be dating long term 
boyfriend Benjamin Maisani, who runs a bar called Eastern Bloc in 
Manhattan, and the two share his converted fire station home in 
Greenwich Village.

The pair have frequently been photographed together, but never at a public event.

In an apparent reference to his relationship, he said in the interview: 'While I feel very blessed to have had so many opportunities as a journalist, I am also blessed far beyond having a great career.

'I love, and I am loved.'

Cooper's disclosure is the latest twist in his eventful life as one of the Vanderbilt family, one of the most famous dynasties America has ever seen.

The bar owner, seen here leaving David Barton Gym in 2010, reportedly lives with Cooper in his converted fire house

Anderson recently moved into this firehouse in Greenwich Village that he bought and renovated

His brother Carter, a Princeton 
graduate, killed himself at the age of 23 by jumping off the family's New
York penthouse balcony two decades ago.

Close bond: Anderson and his mom in 2010

Cooper
and his 87-year-old mother, former fashion designer Gloria Vanderbilt, 
spoke about the tragedy for the first time last September in his talk 
show 'Anderson'.

At the time
he was praised for talking in such an honest way about suicide, and his
latest disclosure is likely to earn him similar plaudits.

Cooper
is the latest of a growing number of celebrities who have come out in a
more relaxed fashion than gay people have in the past.

Star Trek actor Zachary Quinto revealed his sexuality in an interview with New York magazine in which he casually mentioned it when being quizzed about bullying, as if everyone knew already.

He said: 'As a gay man I look at that and say there's a hopelessness that surrounds it, but as a human being I look at it and say 'Why?

'Where's this disparity coming from, and why can't we as a culture and society dig deeper to examine that?' We're terrified of facing ourselves.'

The Big Bang Theory's Jim Parsons also revealed he was gay in a New York Times profile which mentioned his sexuality near the end, adding he had been in a relationship for 10 years.
