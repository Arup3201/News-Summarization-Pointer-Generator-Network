This is the moment two bungling crooks steal an ATM from a Canadian casino not realizing that it's empty.

CCTV footage shows the thieves running into Casino Calgary in Alberta just before 6am on Wednesday morning dressed in dark clothing and bright white sneakers. 

After loading the cash machine on a dolly they wheel it away, with it clumsily toppling over at one point.

After the minor catastrophe - which almost crushed one of the robbers - they exit the casino with their loot in tow.

The operation took less than a minute to complete. 

Police say the thieving duo smashed the glass doors of the casino with a crowbar to gain entry and then headed directly to the ATM.

There were several employees inside the arcade at the time of the theft; however, no one was injured.

The burglars later made off in a waiting vehicle believed to be a silver-colored minivan.

Owners of the casino confirmed that there was no money in the electronic banking machine.

It was in the process of being moved to a different location in the building and was out of order.

Sergeant Travis Baker from the Calgary Police Service said he imagined the robbers were feeling 'fairly disappointed' after discovering their steal was empty.

Wednesday's event marked one of 13 ATM-related smash-and-grab thefts in the Calgary area since last August.

In each of the cases, the offenders have stolen very little, if any, money, as the machines are often emptied several times in a 24-hour period and at the end of the business day.

Authorities have arrested three people in connection two of the 13 incidents; however, it’s believed copycat offenders orchestrated the most recent offence.

Police are now looking for the two offenders and are asking for anyone with information to step forward.
