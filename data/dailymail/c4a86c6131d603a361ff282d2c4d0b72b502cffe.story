Prince Harry began his second day in Estonia by meeting his old roommate from Afghanistan - who he befriended so he could e-mail then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy.

Captain Tanel Tarlap was the only person with an internet connection at Forward Operating Base Edinburgh, Helmand province, during the Prince's 10-week deployment at the end of 2007.

And like any serviceman wanting to touch base with home, Harry was among those clamouring to have a few precious moments of time on Captain Tarlap's laptop.

The pair were reunited today after more than six years as Prince Harry continued a two-day tour to Estonia, where Nato is carrying out its largest ever military exercises amid rising tensions in Ukraine.

The 29-year-old Prince arrived in Talinn yesterday on a £143 Easyjet flight and proved a hit with the locals, posing for selfies in the all white tropical no 1 dress of the Household Cavalry.

Build-up: The prince's visit comes amid Nato's largest ever military exercises in Estonia

Prince Harry and his former roommate chatted in the sunshine today in a muddy field in the Estonian countryside, surrounded by troops from the Baltic state, Britain and the U.S.

As Harry approached Captain Tarlap he said: 'I remember him, that's a familiar face.'

Joined by Major General Riho Terras, the head of Estonia's Armed Forces, he added: 'I was trying to explain the reason why we became friends, because you had the internet, the computer, do you remember?'

The Estonian officer smiled and replied: 'So you could email your girlfriend.'

The two men shared a room with a number of other officers during the prince's first tour of Afghanistan, when he worked as a forward air controller co-ordinating air strikes on Taliban positions.

Captain Tarlap, 34, then a lieutenant, was a liaison officer between the British forces and an Estonian company of around 150 men under UK command.

They only worked together for a few weeks, but quickly struck up a friendship and exchanged battalion emblems as a sign of their closeness.

Harry was pictured proudly wearing the Estonian Guard Battalion's Eagle on his body armour during his deployment.

Joking about the military emblem that Captain Tarlap had given him, Harry said to his friend today: 'I've got no Velcro on me, so you can't stick anything to me.'

Speaking after the Prince had left, Captain Tarlap added: 'I was the only guy in the camp who had a computer with internet access so he had the chance to chat to his girlfriend or family.

'I think everyone was trying to get a connection with people at home.

'We were sharing a room and he would just knock on my shoulder and asked if he could use my computer.'

At the time Harry was dating girlfriend Chelsy Davy. The pair split up and were reunited a number of times before the relationship finally ended a few years ago.

Captain Tarlap added: 'When the Estonian company wanted to do some patrolling in the area we ordered some air support and I would ask Harry if this was possible and he always tried to do it.

'It was always planned but sometimes it was a last-minute call.

Partners: Harry took part in a friendship ceremony with Estonia, which has been close to Britain since 1918

'He was usually in a good mood and happy - he was always positive.

'He would make jokes and just talk about simple things usually. He was very friendly and always happy and excited to get new tasks from his commander.

'You know what he is but when you speak to each other you use first names like everyone else.'

The troops Prince Harry met were part of an exercise called Spring Storm, which involves servicemen from Britain, Estonia and the 
U.S. and is the largest army exercise in the Estonians' training 
calendar.

Soldiers from 
the 1st Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, who have worked 
alongside their Estonian counterparts in Afghanistan, are taking part in
 the training, the final exercise for Estonian conscripts after a year 
of national service.

Britain and Estonia have had close ties since Britain supported the nation's fight for independence in 1918.

In
 recent times a company of soldiers from the Baltic republic have been 
under British command in Afghanistan since Estonia first sent troops to 
the country in 2006.

Some 
wounded soldiers from the European country have even been treated 
alongside British soldiers at the Headley Court rehabilitation centre in
 Surrey.

Tomorrow the Prince will fly to Italy, 
where he will meet veterans from conflicts including the Second World 
War as well as serving military personnel during a three-day 
official visit.
