Pledge: Andrew Lansley, pictured outside No 10 yesterday, will today pledge to give 1m extra people access to an NHS dentist

NHS dentists are to treat an extra million patients following a shake-up in funding.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley will today pledge that everyone who lost their NHS dentist since 2006 will now have access to one.

The Coalition has set aside £28million, trimmed from the NHS budget via efficiency savings, to pay for the new patients.

The funding will be given to primary care trusts, who have bid for the cash by setting out proposals to expand local services.

They will fund new dentists, increase the number of appointments with existing ones, or provide care in people’s homes for patients who cannot travel to a surgery. Between 2006 and 2008, a million Britons lost access to an NHS dentist.

The collapse in coverage followed a disastrous reform of dentists’ contracts by the Labour government.

It also led to a sharp increase in emergency hospital admissions from people carrying out DIY tooth extractions.

Mr Lansley told the Daily Mail: ‘Labour politicians let down families across the country who were no longer able to see an NHS dentist because of their failed policies.

‘Giving those people back their NHS dentist is a key priority of mine so I am delighted that we have been able to find more money for dentistry because of our successful programme of efficiency savings in the NHS.

‘This is a great example of how the money we are saving by working more efficiently, cutting bureaucracy and rooting out waste in the NHS is being reinvested in frontline services for patients.’

The Coalition launched trials of a new dental contract, particularly focused on improving children’s oral health, last year.

Dentists will be paid for the number of patients they care for and the health results, rather than the number of courses of treatment performed.
