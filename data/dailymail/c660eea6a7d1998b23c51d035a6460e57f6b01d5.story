For most, living the Good Life and having a great beach body do not go hand in hand – but it looks like Felicity Kendal has achieved it.

The 66-year-old looked toned and trim in a simple black swimsuit as she took a dip in the sea on a recent holiday in Barbados.

Former ‘rear of the year’ Kendal who has always shunned plastic surgery, proved that a light jog along the beach is the key to looking good in your sixties.

The Rosemary and Thyme actress, who is
currently on holiday with her long-term partner, Michael Rudman, 73, 
puts her svelte physique down to hours in the gym.

She
said at the beginning of her stint on Strictly come Dancing in 2010: 
‘I’m afraid the bad news is girls you’ve got to do the work in the gym.

'I haven’t suddenly morphed into looking in the last week how I look now.’

Her physical fitness even earned her the nickname ‘Flexible Felicity’ on the show, which saw her eliminated in the eighth week.

She revealed that she dropped almost two 
dress sizes following the BBC show, in which she was partnered with 
Vincent Simone, saying she could fit into the size 26in waist jeans she 
wore when she was on the 1970s show, The Good Life.

But it seems her co-star and on-screen husband, Richard Briers, doesn’t live up to his character’s love of the healthy, organic-vegetable-eating, life as she does.

Instead, the 79-year-old actor recently admitted he is paying the price for a lifetime addiction to cigarettes.

He said earlier this month that he is suffering from emphysema.
