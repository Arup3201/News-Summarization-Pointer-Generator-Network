Manchester United's hopes of landing Gareth Bale have been dealt a blow after Real Madrid claimed they would never sell the forward.

Louis van Gaal's side have been linked with a sensational £120million move for the Wales international, who has been a star for the Spanish side since joining the club in a world record £86million move from Tottenham in the summer of 2013.

But with reports from Spain suggesting United were ready to swoop for Bale, Real president Florentino Perez claimed the 25-year-old is not for sale at any price.

Perez said: ‘I cannot imagine Real Madrid without Bale. We would never listen to any offer, no matter the amount.

‘This is a unique player who has already given us a lot and it is crucial for the future of the club.’

Despite the president's bold stance on Bale, Real fans have been split on whether they would sell the forward.

A recent poll of 30,000 revealed nearly 54 per cent would be happy to sell the former Spurs man, who helped Madrid to Champions League glory earlier in 2014.
