Boris Johnson admitted last night he hopes to be considered to lead the Conservative Party after David Cameron.

The London Mayor, pressed on his leadership ambitions by Sky News anchor Kay Burley, insisted the position would not become vacant for five years.

But in his most candid remarks to date, he finally conceded: 'It would be a wonderful thing to be thought to be in a position to be considered for such an honour.'

However he insisted he thinks it is 'highly unlikely'.

Mr Johnson, running to become MP in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, has long been tipped as a future leader of the party, most recently by Mr Cameron. 

He said last month he would serve a 'full second term' until 2020, but not a third and named as potential successors Mr Johnson, Home Secretary Theresa May and Chancellor George Osborne.

Yesterday, Mr Johnson said: 'It is at least five years away which is an aeon in British politics, by which time whatever my personal ambitions may be there will be thrusting young men and women who will be overtaking me and who knows, it will all be different.'

Potential successors: Mr Cameron named Home Secretary Theresa May and Chancellor George Osborne

Mr Cameron has admitted that what he called his own 'calm smoothness' could give people the wrong impression about how urgently he wants to win the General Election.

He told The Spectator he had 'no end' of passion but was a Conservative, a tribe of people who 'don't always wear their beliefs on their sleeve'.

Asked why many people believe he must do more to demonstrate that he really wants to win, he said: 'I don't know. There is something about me – I always manage to portray a calm smoothness or something.'
