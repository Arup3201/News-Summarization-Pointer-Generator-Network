Australia: they’ve done it again. That’s five World Cups now, their aura disseminated on five different continents – Asia (1987), Europe (1999), Africa (2003), North America (2007), and Australasia (2015). If they ever stage the tournament in Antarctica, the rest of the world may as well save themselves the air fare.

Their story is a remarkable one – of swift, ruthless renewal and of the belief inherent in Australian cricket that their natural position is up there, not down here. To watch them against New Zealand was to watch expectation thrash hope.

Australia’s self-belief cannot simply be transplanted into other cricketing cultures. But their refusal to tolerate failing systems can.

No team could stop the Aussies claiming yet another World Cup, this time on home soil

Less than two years ago everyone was having a good chuckle at Homeworkgate and David Warner. Australia lost 4-0 in India, Warner swung for Joe Root, and Mickey Arthur was put out to pasture a fortnight before the Ashes.

While England creaked their way through a flattering 3-0 win that summer, convincing themselves that all was well with the world, Australia’s new coach Darren Lehmann was thanking God for a schedule that would give his side a crack at instant revenge. The rest is history.

Australia’s nadirs are as low as anyone’s – they just last less long. It is inconceivable that they would tolerate, as England are in the process of doing, a period of failure that extends far beyond the dictionary definition of ‘transition’.

For that, as much as anything, their latest World Cup win deserves an admiring nod. Australia generally know when and how to peak.

But their behaviour during Sunday’s final means this admiration stretches only so far.

Not for the first time, we were reminded of a curious contradiction at the heart of Australian cricket: while they have always been engagingly good losers (better, in fact, than most), they are also deeply unlovable winners.

Brad Haddin, who claimed he felt uncomfortable about New Zealand’s niceness during the build-up to the group game at Auckland, was at the centre of things, as he often is.

After Martin Guptill was bowled by Glenn Maxwell, Haddin felt the need to clap his gloves in Guptill’s face. Then, after the dismissal of Grant Elliott, Haddin and James Faulkner sent him packing with various snarls and grimaces.

A meme doing the rounds used both this image and one of Brendon McCullum shaking Michael Clarke’s hand at the end of his match-clinching 74 to compare and contrast the teams’ attitudes. Even while they’re basking in glory, it should make Cricket Australia squirm.

Mind you, it wasn’t much of a surprise. The immediate postscript of New Zealand’s win over South Africa in the semi-final was the sight of Elliott comforting the stricken Dale Steyn, like Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee all over again.

Australia, on the other hand, gurned their way through victory over India in Sydney, with Mitchell Starc harrying Suresh Raina, and Warner applauding from the balcony after his fellow wallflower Virat Kohli dropped Haddin.

The ICC ignored all this – presumably because they didn’t want to be seen to sully the tournament’s blue-riband matches. But they had already punished Pakistan’s Wahab Riaz for his crude goading of Shane Watson in the quarter-finals – a set-to which at least had the merit of forming part of a stirring head-to-head.

But sledging without context is even worse: the Guptill and Elliott send-offs just looked crass and cruel. Sledging, we are told with wearying certainty, is part of the game. But when did it become de rigueur to cackle at a batsman who is already dealing with the disappointment of heading back to the pavilion?

Merv Hughes used to do it all the time, not least to Graeme Hick. His rationale was that he was getting inside Hick’s head before the next battle. In a six-Test series, it made a sick kind of sense. Haddin has no such excuse.

No Australian cricket-lover I know enjoys this sort of thing, though some on Twitter claim with some justification that the Poms are in no position to talk: see the life and crimes of Jimmy Anderson.

But England fans are also aware that Anderson’s sledging contributed to their team’s unpopularity during the years when Andy Flower’s side was doing well. When England’s wheel turned, there was precious little sympathy waiting for them on the other side.

The same applies to Australia. If there were neutrals out there who didn’t want New Zealand to win the final, they didn’t immediately advertise the fact. And this had more to do with the fact that sports fans love an underdog. They also dislike arrogance, nastiness and sneering.

You can admire the Australian cricket team. But it’s a little harder to warm to them.

A CHANGE OF PLAN

From now on the Top Spin will move from its weekly slot on a Tuesday and appear more regularly, as a blog rather than a column. It will come out whenever there is a big cricket story to comment on, and sometimes even when there isn’t.

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

Thanks boss!

Regular readers will know of the ICC’s Bangladeshi president Mustafa Kamal, who recently endeared himself to his own organisation by referring to them – not unreasonably – as the ‘Indian Cricket Council’. That followed Bangladesh’s quarter-final loss to India, when Kamal was convinced the umpires had it in for his team.

Now, he appears to be at it again, this time after he was denied the chance to hand over the World Cup to the Australian team on the podium at the MCG on Sunday. Instead the honour befell ICC chairman Narayanaswami Srinivasan, prompting Kamal to huff about his ‘constitutional right’, duly ‘dishonoured’.

Ominously, Kamal is reported to have said: ‘After I go back home, I will let the whole world know what’s happening in ICC. I will let the whole world know about those guys who are doing these mischievous things.’

As president of the organisation he is threatening to rat on, Kamal may like to ask himself why he hasn’t considered spilling the beans before. You could not, as they say, make it up.

Revolving doors

Kevin Pietersen’s decision to pull out of his IPL deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad could have a curious knock-on effect for England. It means an extra slot in the Sunrisers team for both a middle-order batsman and an overseas player – and that could be good news for Eoin Morgan.

But it also lessens the chance of Morgan being released for a few days to captain England in their one-day international against Ireland at Malahide on May 8. Look out for the very short-term appointment of yet another England captain…

Best bib and tucker

It’s easy to forget there were two Australian captains at the World Cup: Michael Clarke… and George Bailey, who played one game, scored 55 against England, and ceded both the armband and his place in the side when Clarke returned from injury.

He evidently made peace with his role. Spies in Australia tell us that, 18 hours after the World Cup final, a bleary-eyed Bailey appeared at a civic reception still wearing the fluorescent bib that appeared affixed to him for most of the tournament. Now that’s commitment.
