A beluga whale who was on loan to under-fire SeaWorld has died after fracturing his jaw during an 'interaction' with two other whales and later contracting an infection, it has emerged.

Nanuq, who was around 31 or 32 years old, entertained millions of visitors at the firm's Orlando, Florida, theme park  while on a long-term breeding loan from Canada's Vancouver Aquarium.

But during a recent encounter with two of the three beluga whales he lived with, the 2200lbs marine creature suffered a fractured jaw. He later developed an infection and passed away on Thursday.

Although Nanuq had been undergoing treatment for the infection at the time of his death, a post-mortem examination has been arranged to confirm the cause. The results are expected in weeks.

It comes just a month after SeaWorld's chief executive resigned following low visitor numbers in the wake of the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which criticized the firm's treatment of killer whales.

Jim Atchison, who had served as CEO and president since 2009, stepped down in January amid accusations that the company's treatment of killer whales may have led to the deaths of trainers. 

On Friday, SeaWorld Orlando paid tribute to Nanuq, who was a hit with a number of celebrity visitors  to the attraction, including actor Will Ferrell and actresses Isla Fisher and Sarah Michelle Gellar.

In a Facebook statement, the park said: 'Fans, please join us in remembering one of our favorite beluga whales, Nanuq. An older whale, [he] passed away yesterday at the estimated age of 31-32.

Paying tribute: In a Facebook statement, the resort said: 'Fans, please join us in remembering one of our favorite beluga whales, Nanuq. An older whale, [he] passed away yesterday at the estimated age of 31-32

'As an ambassador for all arctic animals, he has delighted millions of visitors to our Wild Arctic attraction, and has been part of the SeaWorld family since 1997. 

'Nanuq was a wonderful whale and dearly loved by his trainers and our vets, as well as guests. 

The park, operated by SeaWorld Entertainment, added that the whale's fractured jaw 'resulted from an interaction between two animals that were part of a compatible social group'.

During his time at SeaWorld Orlando (and earlier, SeaWorld San Diego), Nanuq interacted with members of the public as part of an $119-plus scheme called the 'Beluga Interaction Program'.

On its website, the park says the 'intimate' program offers visitors 'a rare and wonderful opportunity to learn more about the amazing Arctic and connect with one of its most charming inhabitants'.

On Friday, Scott Smith, a University of South Carolina assistant  hospitality professor, said Nanuq's death could be potentially damaging to SeaWorld following the release of Blackfish.

'It really is one of the worst times this kind of news could come out,' he said. 'Any other time, it probably wouldn’t even make a blip on the radar, but now everyone is watching SeaWorld.'

Longtime SeaWorld critic and Animal Welfare Institute marine mammal scientist Naomi Rose added that in the wild, suffering a broken jaw from an 'interaction' with another animal seems unlikely.

Speaking to the Orlando Sentinel, Ms Rose said: 'If he died because of something related to that infection he got related to the broken jaw, then he died of being in captivity.'

Blackfish, which implied that the stress of life in captivity may have been responsible of an orca's killing of Orlando trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010, sparked widespread criticism of SeaWorld,

Since its release, attendance has declined at the company's parks in Orlando, San Diego, California and San Antonio, Texas. SeaWorld's stock value has also plummeted.

To counter the backlash, the firm, which has participated in animal rescue programs for more than 50 years, has announced plans to nearly double the size of its orca enclosures in upcoming years. 

SeaWorld has not yet named a replacement for Mr Atchison.
