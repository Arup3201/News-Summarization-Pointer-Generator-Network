A New York Times beat reporter just landed a book advance of over $1million for her debut novel, which she's been 'quietly writing,' the author announced Wednesday morning.

Publisher's Weekly reports that Stephanie Clifford, 36, who currently covers the courts for the Times, also sold the film options to Everybody Rise shortly after the book deal.

Clifford tweeted about the recently closed deal to her followers on Wednesday.

Young author: Stephanie Clifford, 36, secured the deal for her book Everybody Rise for a reported seven-figure advance

'Some personal news: I've been quietly writing a novel for years. St Martins bought it, & Fox 2000 took movie rights.'

Charlie Spicer, executive editor of St Martin's Press, described the book as 'Edith Wharton meets Bonfire of the Vanities for the 21st Century.'

Its 'flawed' protagonist claws her way up the social ladder among 'a new generation of heirs and strivers [who] are jockeying for social power' among society in the Upper East Side.

After St Martin's Press closed on the deal, the publishing house turned around and got it optioned to Fox 2000.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the title comes from the Stephen Sondheim song Ladies Who Lunch.

Heirs: Clifford's novel drew repeated comparisons to the work of Edith Wharton, who wrote novels such as The Age of Innocence casting subtle critique on the upper-class society of the East Coast

Clifford graduated from Harvard as an undergraduate, where she was the senior editor of The Harvard Crimson, the school's paper.

She has worked on the business and media desks at the Times, reporting on retail, advertising and magazines, and before that was a senior reporter at Inc magazine.
