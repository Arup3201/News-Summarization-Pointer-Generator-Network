Andy Murray claimed his Valencia Open title triumph stands him in good stead for upcoming challenges after he fended off five match points to beat Tommy Robredo.

In a match which swung first one way and then the other, the Scot eventually won 3-6 7-6 (9/7) 7-6 (10/8) claiming the final set on a tie-break against his Spanish opponent.

The victory is a massive step for Murray in qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals as he moved up to fifth in the Race to London standings with ninth place enough to qualify.

Andy Murray can seal qualification for the ATP World Tour Finals by reaching the quarter-finals of this week's Paris Masters.

Even if he was to lose his opening match, all of the following would have to happen for him to miss out on the season-ending finale in London:

'I know it was an incredible match,' Murray told atpworldtour.com. 'The tennis at the end and in the second set was high level. I played well at the right moments.

'I don't know how I managed to come through it - I was very tired, Tommy was very tired as well.

'When you have to work hard for something it means more, you get more satisfaction from it.

'I kept fighting and it stands me in good stead for the end of this year and the beginning of next.'

Murray had also saved five match points against Robredo when he won the Shenzhen Open title in southern China last month.

This match was equally exhausting, lasting three hours and 20 minutes - the longest final on the ATP world tour this year - and at the end Robredo appeared to make a jokey obscene gesture at his opponent.

It was the 31st title of Murray's career and was further demonstration that he is back on track - Shenzhen was his first title victory in 14 months.

Murray appeared nervous in the first set which his Spanish opponent won comfortably 6-3. It was much tighter in the second set but in the tie-break

Robredo had two points to win the title but Murray produced some battling heroics to hold on and then take the set himself, winning the tie-break 9-7.

It looked equally dicey for Murray when Robredo broke serve to take a 4-3 lead in the final set but the Scot drew on reserves of energy to break back immediately to level the match.

It was Robredo's turn then to rescue a match point against him and take the final set to a tie-break, with both players looking to be on their last legs.

The 32-year-old Spaniard saw three more match points come and go before he netted to give Murray the chance of victory and he made no mistake with a backhand winner after a fierce final rally.

It was a heartbreaking defeat for Spaniard Tommy Robredo who failed to capitalise on five match points against Andy Murray in front of his home fans.

It was the second time in a month that the British No 1 saved five match points against Robredo, the last time being in the final of the Shenzhen Open on September 28.

And this time a shattered Robredo reacted with a light-hearted double middle finger salute.
