A mother-of-two died of cancer because she used to welcome her shipyard worker father home from work each night with a hug, an inquest heard today.

Annette Bhatti, who was just 49, also helped her ill mother to scrub her father’s work uniform by hand more than 40 years ago.

They did not know at the time that they were breathing in deadly dust particles from his asbestos-ridden clothes.

Mrs Bhatti, a housing officer, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in June 2010. She married her long-term partner Bal Bhatti a month later.

Just 18 months later, in December last year, she lost her battle with the lung disease at her home in Southampton, Hampshire.

Her death has left her surviving father, now a pensioner, devastated and inconsolable.

Mesothelioma is normally associated with people over 50 and more commonly among men who worked at shipyards.

The mother-of-two, 49, was exposed to the asbestos dust fibres from birth until she moved out of home aged 18

Mrs Bhatti’s father Lawrence Ramplee, now a pensioner, was exposed to asbestos while employed by Hills Construction in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

He was later further exposed to asbestos during shifts at ship repairers Harland and Wolff at the city's docks when Annette was just a toddler.

Mr Ramplee's jobs involved cutting up 10ft corrugated asbestos sheets by hand, coroner Keith Wiseman heard.

His work clothing was worn home where Mrs Bhatti was ‘exposed to the dust fibres in the air’ at a very young age. She helped to wash his clothes because her mother was ill with lung disease.

Mr Wiseman said: ‘The clothing worn during the week was taken home to be cleaned at home.

‘Somewhat tragically, Mr Ramplee recalls occasions giving his daughter a hug when he got home before he changed.

‘In later childhood Annette was often doing the laundry herself because her mother was not always entirely well.

‘The washing was done by hand so she was exposed to dust fibres in the air.

'This was from a very young age.’

He added: ‘There was never any warning about working with this particular substance.

‘One doesn't have to be working oneself in industry to die in this way.

‘Annette's exposure to the industrial disease occurred very much indirectly, when her father Mr Ramplee was employed from the mid 50s.

‘There was significant asbestos exposure during a long period of time.

Speaking after the inquest, her 
brother Stuart Ramplee said his sister ‘was so full of life’ and 
travelled extensively the year she died, visiting Hong Kong, New York, 
Australia, the Seychelles and Dubai.

He said: ‘Her life was on the up. He (her father) totally blames himself and he has not been the same person ever since.

‘He is broken - absolutely devastated.’

Recording a verdict of death due to an industrial disease, Mr Wiseman said: 'The way in which events happened in this case is not in my experience uncommon, but perhaps it is uncommon for someone quite so young.

'It doesn't ever seem to happen in that way.'

Her brother Stuart said despite her condition, Mrs Bhatti, whose daughters Luci and Rachel, are both in their 20s, ‘never complained’.

Speaking at his wife’s funeral, which was attended by hundreds of people, Mr Bhatti praised her caring nature.

He said: ‘Annette was someone who always put others ahead of herself.

‘Anyone that ever had the pleasure of meeting her instantly took her to their heart.

‘She leaves a void in our hearts that will never be filled and a legacy that will never be forgotten.’

Lawyers are hoping to secure compensation for Annette's family.

Compensation for relatives of asbestos victims in 'landmark' ruling

Thousands of relatives of industrial workers who died of an asbestos-related lung cancer will get compensation as a result of a 'landmark' insurance liability ruling

Thousands of relatives of industrial workers who died of an asbestos-related lung cancer will get compensation as a result of a 'landmark' insurance liability ruling yesterday by the UK's highest court.

The Supreme Court decided that liability was 'triggered' when employees were exposed to asbestos dust - not when symptoms of mesothelioma emerged sometimes decades later.

Solicitors said the ruling meant that victims were covered by policies in place when asbestos fibres were inhaled - and employers' insurers would have to meet compensation claims.

Families said they hoped that the decision by a panel of five Supreme Court justices in London would end years of litigation and lead to speedy insurance payouts.

Judges said industrial diseases which could lie dormant for long periods raised 'peculiar' legal difficulties - and liability for deaths caused by mesothelioma, a 'hideous' and 'inevitably fatal' cancer of lung linings, had 'pre-occupied' courts in recent years.

Union bosses and victims' families criticised insurance firms who fought the case - saying they should have accepted responsibility and spent money given to lawyers on compensation.

One insurance firm involved in litigation said it had wanted 'resolution' of the liability issue in order to 'provide greater certainty'.

'This is a landmark ruling which will affect thousands of victims of asbestos,' said Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union.

'It is a disgrace that insurance companies went to such lengths to shirk their responsibilities. For callous insurers this means the responsibility holiday is over.'

Manchester-based solicitor Carol Ann Hepworth, whose firm John Pickering and Partners represents hundreds of victims' families, said she hoped that claims would be quickly met by employers' insurers.

She estimated that some payouts could top £100,000.
