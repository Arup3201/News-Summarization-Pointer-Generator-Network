Rory McIlroy sent Andy Murray a text apologising for being unable to attend the Scot's US Open match against Robin Haase on Monday, and reciprocate the support he was given by the British No 1 at the golf in New Jersey last week.

It is not known if his former fiancee Caroline Wozniacki playing the same day was a factor. 

David Beckham  is expected to attend this week, possibly to support Murray.

Sorry : Rory McIlroy text Andy Murray to apologise for being unable to attend his US open match on Monday

Hard-fought: Murray defeated Robin Haase in four sets on Monday in a grueling first-round encounter 

Tennis fan: David Beckham was at Wimbledon  in July, and is expected at the US Open this week

Painful: Murray suffered from severe cramp but battled hard to secure his place in the US Open second round

The ex factor:  McIlroy's former girlfriend was also in action on Monday and may explain his no show

Elsewhere at Flushing Meadows, few tears will have been shed for Wayne Odesnik after he lost in straight sets on Tuesday to Kei Nishikori.

The US Tennis Association had been forced to give the controversial American a wildcard by virtue of him being the best performer at a series of Challenger events. It was done with reluctance as he was banned for owning Human Growth Hormone in 2010.

Pseudo Brit: Croat Borna Coric, who lives in Middlesex, and is coached by Englishman Ryan Jones, beat 29th seed Lukas Rosol 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 on Tuesday

Brits are thin on the ground in singles but outstanding 17-year-old Borna Coric is a good proxy.

The longtime Middlesex-based Croatian, who is coached by Englishman Ryan Jones, caused a significant upset on Tuesday when he thrashed 29th seed Lukas Rosol 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 having come through qualifying.

The reigning US Open junior champion, he is a name to remember. 

Mister unpopular: Wayne Odesnik has previously been banned for possessing drugs, and lost to Kei Nishikori
