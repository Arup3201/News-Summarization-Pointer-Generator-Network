No receipt: John Durning has never been asked for a receipt from Ed Balls despite cleaning the windows at his Castleford home once a month

Ed Balls was accused of ‘total hypocrisy’ last night after his window cleaner revealed he has never asked for a receipt in 17 years.

The Shadow Chancellor provoked controversy at the weekend when he lectured families on their duty to collect receipts and personal details from gardeners, cleaners and handymen, no matter how small the job done.

Mr Balls said he always followed the practice – and had done ‘since I have been involved in politics’. 

But inquiries in Castleford, West Yorkshire, where he and his MP wife Yvette Cooper have a family home, have shown that he has never asked his window cleaning firm for a receipt despite employing them for nearly two decades.

Pontefract Window Cleaning Services last night confirmed it had never been asked for a receipt by Mr Balls. The firm cleans the windows at the three-storey Balls family home once a month, charging £12 each time.

Christine Durning, 66, who handles the family firm’s paperwork, refused to criticise Mr Balls for his comments and said she ‘didn’t want to get involved in any controversy’. But she added: ‘I’m not doing anything wrong here, I’m just telling you the facts and I don’t give him a receipt and he doesn’t ask for a receipt.’

Mrs Durning said the well-established family firm had never been asked for a receipt by any of its customers. Instead they simply take cash or cheque or write their customers a note to inform them money is due.

Her son John, 34, who cleans the MPs’ windows, said: ‘It only takes me about ten minutes to do, it’s no problem. After each clean I drop a note through the door which states, “Your windows have been cleaned”.

‘I see a cleaner sometimes, but I have never seen either of them or even met them.’

Conservative MP Peter Bone last night said it was ‘absurd’ to expect people to get receipts for everything and it was hypocritical of Mr Balls to suggest it.

'Total hypocrisy': The Shadow Chancellor has been slammed by Conservative MP Peter Bone, who said it was ‘absurd’ to expect people to get receipts for everything and it was hypocritical of Mr Balls to suggest it

He said: ‘Having lectured the nation on the need to demand receipts, it turns out he doesn’t even do it himself.

‘It is total hypocrisy from a man who wants to be considered as a potential Chancellor.’

He added: ‘This idea from Ed Balls was ludicrous from the start – you can’t expect people to demand a receipt for every minor job they have done. It is basically suggesting that every small trader is dodging tax, which is a slur.’

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Mr Balls’s comments suggested Labour was planning a ‘Big Brother’ state where people’s every action was monitored.

Even Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna admitted: ‘I have to confess I don’t keep a receipt for every single thing that I get people to do.’

A spokesman for Mr Balls last night said his practice of demanding receipts applied only to jobs where he pays in cash.

He pointed out that Mr Balls pays his window cleaner by cheque and receives handwritten invoices every few months.

The spokesman said: ‘As Ed said, he asks for receipts when paying in cash for work done so that, as Shadow Chancellor, he knows he has a written record.

‘Needless to say, a cheque obviously means both sides have a written record of the transaction.

‘Ed’s window cleaner sends a bill every few months and he pays them by cheque. He’s done this for 17 years with the same local business.’

The controversy began on Sunday when the question of what constitutes tax avoidance was discussed during a BBC interview.

Mr Balls said: ‘The right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt and a record for the fact that you have paid them.’  

On Sunday Ed Balls said he always asked for a receipt because it was the ‘right thing to do’.

But he and his wife Yvette Cooper were among MPs criticised when the Parliamentary expenses scandal erupted in 2009.

Between 2005 and 2007 they ‘flipped’ their second home designation to three different properties – including their North London home and a constituency property in Castleford, West Yorkshire.

Under the old expenses system, MPs could designate either a London home or a constituency property as their second home. They could then change the designation of their second home – nicknamed ‘flipping’ – and increase the amount they could claim for mortgage interest payments.

Together they claimed a total of £24,400 on their second-home allowance.

A Tory MP said it was wrong for them to claim the London property as their second home when they spent most of their time there, but they were cleared by the Standards Commissioner in 2008.
