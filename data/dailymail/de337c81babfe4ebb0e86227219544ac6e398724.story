Starbucks deny £100million investment is under threat following perceived 'cheap shots' made against the multinational

Starbucks has denied threatening to withhold millions of pounds of investment in Britain after the Prime Minister said tax avoiding companies need to 'wake up and smell the coffee'.

The UK boss of the coffee giant reportedly asked for a meeting with David Cameron amid concerns it is being targeted with 'cheap shots' by the Government.

However, the multinational said Friday's meeting had been in the diary for a long time and was not booked as a reaction to Mr Cameron.

The Prime Minister made the comments at a meeting of world leaders and business bosses at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.

It was seen as a swipe at Starbucks, which paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in 14 years of trading in Britain and nothing in the last three years.

Asked at the time whether the Davos remarks were aimed at Starbucks, the
 Prime Minister's official spokesman said the address 'speaks for 
itself'.

UK managing director Kris Engskov met Government officials on Friday.

While tax issues were likely to have been on the agenda, the company said no threats were made to suspend pledged funding for new UK branches.

The Sunday Telegraph quoted an unnamed source that is 'close' to the multinational as saying: 'The PM is singling the business out for cheap shots, a company that, it should not forgotten pledged to pay tax now and in the future.'

It said the multinational could suspend plans to invest £100million on new branches in the UK following the criticism, meaning that the creation of new jobs is in doubt.

Starbucks has since changed its tax arrangements following a public outcry when the tax avoidance scheme emerged.

It will now pay around £10million in corporation tax this year and then automatically when it enters profit - expected to be in about three years. 

The company said it has made no profits in the UK since its arrival in 1998, apart from one year.

Starbucks has faced regular criticism since it emerged last year that it, along with companies such as Amazon and Google, report multimillion pound revenues in the UK but pay little or no tax.

David Cameron told the World Economic Forum that tax avoiding companies needed to 'wake up and smell the coffee', which is said to have angered Starbucks

Starbucks was targeted by protesters after it emerged it did not pay corporation tax in the past three years

Last month, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander accused Starbucks of treating its tax obligations 'like the church collection plate'.

Branches have also been targetted by anti-tax avoidance protesters.

Starbucks has more than 700 outlets in the UK, generating revenues of more than £3billion.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News that Starbucks had not been singled out for criticism on tax.

He said: 'I don't think we would ever 
single out a single company but I do think companies in this country 
need to pay their way.

'I think they need to do what's right as far as that is concerned and I 
think most people watching this would agree, companies should pay their 
fair share of taxation.

'That applies to that company and anyone else you care to mention. It 
certainly applies to millions of smaller businesses in this country.

'People who work very hard, build up their companies from scratch..., 
are paying their fair share of taxes all the way through. The same rules
 have to apply to everyone.'

A Starbucks spokesman said: 'We had a very constructive meeting which was long-scheduled. We do not discuss the details of our Government meetings but can say that we do not recognise how it has been reported.

'Starbucks agrees with the Prime Minister that all businesses should pay their fair share.

'In the UK, we employ 9,000 people, contribute £300 million a year to the economy and are foregoing tax deductions that will make the Exchequer at least £20 million better off.'

Grant Shapps said Starbucks had not been singled out for criticism but said companies 'need to pay their way'

The TaxPayers Alliance has called on the Government to simplify tax laws in the UK to attract and keep businesses in the country.

Robert Oxley, campaign manager at the pressure group, said: 'It's politicians who are in charge of our broken tax code.

'They are the ones who have the responsibility for fixing it. We have one of the most complex tax codes in the world - with more than 1,700 pages.

'The Government urgently need to simplify and reform our tax system so that companies invest in Britain.

'Starbucks have been particularly stung by the criticism by politicians and the public and their brand recognition went down.

'Tax should not be a moral lecture by the Prime Minister.'

Mr Cameron has faced a business backlash 
over his campaign to target tax avoidance, with Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein 
saying the criticism risked 'criminalising every right-thinking person 
who organises his or her affairs in a sensible way'.
