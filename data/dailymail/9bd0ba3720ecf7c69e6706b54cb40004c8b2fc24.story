It is not the most scientific way of predicting the result of a vote, but supporters of Scottish independence will be hoping the result of this two horse race bodes well for Thursday's referendum.

Two evenly matched horses – called Yes We Can and Neigh Thanks – took part in a specially staged race at Musselburgh Racecourse near Edinburgh.

And despite the bookmakers having each equally handicapped runner at 5/6, Yes We Can won easily, beating its rival by four lengths.

Both horses were provided by Scottish trainer Jim Goldie, 58, who said: 'Somebody put it to me and wondered whether I would supply the horses for such a race.

''Yes' went straight ahead. Two or three weeks ago it was definitely Better Together. I would be surprised if the Yes campaign win by four lengths like their horse did today.

'The horses were handicapped. The one that was second, Neigh Thanks, was stronger, but we gave her more weight to slow down.

'I don't think it will make a difference to the referendum, but if it gets more people out to vote that's democracy.

'Folk should go out and vote cause it's obviously going to determine Scottish future.

Ms Grant said: 'It's amazing to be a part of something this historic for Scotland'

'What will be will be. It's a horse race and there will always be winners and losers. It was always going to be a good crack. That's the main thing.'

Winning jockey Rachel Grant said: 'It was brilliant. I am obviously very pleased. It's amazing to be a part of something this historic for Scotland.

'It was really quite something.' 

Neigh Thanks - real name Midnight Dynamo - was ridden by Carol Bartley, a three-times champion amateur lady jockey.

After the race, which was organised by Ladbrokes, both jockey strips were put up for auction, with the 'Yes' shirt making £500 and the 'No' shirt making £300 for the Cash for Kids charity. 

Winning the independence referendum will be no piece of cake, but the No campaign might have found the recipe for success, according to an unusual poll.

An Edinburgh bakery has been monitoring sales of its Union flag and Saltire-iced cupcakes since March to try to predict the outcome of Scotland's referendum.

Cuckoo's revealed today that the No cake has outsold its rival in the run-up to the historic vote.

The Dundas Street bakery said that of the thousands of its opinion poll cupcakes consumed, 47.7% were No cakes and 43.5% were Yes.

The undecideds - who opted for a cake with an iced question mark - made up the remaining 8.8%.

Co-founder Graham Savage said: 'We have seen an increase in sales generally and some big orders have come in from both sides.

'Our poll has been conducted professionally throughout the campaign and we are delighted that the results have shown to be so similar to the official results.

'We have calculated that since the campaign was launched, we have sold 80,000 cupcakes from our full range, including the Opinion Poll cupcake.'

Official polls released at the weekend put the Yes and No camps neck and neck.

Three put the No campaign in the lead while one put the independence movement ahead.

The opinion poll cakes are raspberry and white chocolate flavoured and cost £2.50 to take away or £3 to eat in.
