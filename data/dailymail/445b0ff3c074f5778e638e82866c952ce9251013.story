With
operating lights still hanging eerily from the ceilings and patient records sprawled across the rotten floor, it’s hard to imagine this derelict 
building was once an iconic hospital.

But the abandoned and decaying hallways, covered with peeling paint and weaving their way between empty, dusty rooms, are all that is left of the once busy Lancaster Moor Hospital.

The eerie photographs capture the inside of the hospital - which opened in 1816 and was once the county's first asylum - and were taken by student Jonathon Tattersall, 22.

'The hospital has its own uniqueness and atmosphere which I could sense when walking around,' said Mr Tattersall, from Bradford.

'You can see the amazing and unique spaces that are left behind and hidden away from the public gaze.

'I like to try and convey the sadness of the stunning architecture left to ruin when nowadays you have bland and horrible modern architecture appearing in towns and cities.

'The buildings built in the previous century are a thing of the past.'

The hospital in Lancaster has been derelict since 1991.

It opened in 1816 and was Lancaster’s first county asylum. It was later renamed Lancaster Moor hospital and at one point could hold up to 3,200 patients.

The old Lancaster Moor Hospital, built 1883, with Morecambe Bay - and Lakeland hills - in the distance. The building is grade II listed and currently being redeveloped to create housing, like many former hospitals

Mr Tattersall said: 'My love for dereliction started off with a local mansion that I found when glimpsed through some trees.

'I occasionally went down with my camera to record the rate of deterioration, and have ever since had a fascination with derelict buildings.

'The people I show my photographs to are amazed by what~s behind the closed doors of buildings they walk past daily whilst on their travels.'
