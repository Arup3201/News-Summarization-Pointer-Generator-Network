Why should Jesus be the only one having all the fun turning water into wine?

Well, maybe he doesn't have to be.

A new DIY hooch-making kit enables you to turn all of your favourite juices into alcoholic tipples using only a powder.

Make your own hooch using Alcoholic Alchemy's Spike Your Juice which allows you to turn any juice into an alcopop

Turn all your favourite juices into homemade alcopops using Alcoholic Alchemy's 'magic' hooch-making powder

Alcoholic Alchemy's make-our-own-alcopop kit Spike Your Juice, available on Firebox.com, allows you to brew hooch in just 48 hours using naturally sweetened fruit juice and an air-locked plastic bottle.

Just sprinkle the 'magic' powder into the juice - high-sugar varieties such as grape, cranberry or pomegranate work best - pop in the plug and wait.

The minimum time for fermentation is 48 hours, but the longer you leave the juice to brew the more potent your drink will become - to a maximum of 14 per cent alcohol.

The only requirements for making the hooch are that the juice have a minimum sugar content of 20g, be unrefrigerated, not artificially sweetened and non-filtered.

The requirements for buying the powder be that you are over 18 years old.
