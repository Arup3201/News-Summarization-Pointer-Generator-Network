Jailed: James Stone was sentenced to eight years in prison after grooming a 15-year-old girl on Facebook and luring her to his flat

A pub manager who had sex with a girl of 15 after grooming her over the internet was caught when he boasted about what he had done to a controversial group of paedophile hunters.

The schoolgirl’s worried mother contacted Letzgo Hunting, which tracks down and confronts suspected sexual predators, after learning her daughter may have been targeted.

The group set up two fake profiles on Facebook pretending to be girls aged 14 and 15, and engaged James Stone, 24, in web chats. 

And when he confessed to one of the decoys that he’d had sex with the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, the group confronted him in the pub where he worked before telling her mother to call the police.

Stone was jailed for eight years at Nottingham Crown Court yesterday after admitting grooming, sexual activity with a child, possessing and distributing indecent images of a child and possessing extreme pornography.

Letzgo Hunting’s vigilante tactics of luring out then confronting suspected abusers have earned it praise from parents — but criticism from the police and NSPCC.

The meetings are usually filmed, with the footage being posted on the internet and handed to the police.

Evidence collected by the group played no part in the conviction, according to the police.

But after he was jailed, a spokesman wrote on the group’s Facebook page: ‘James Stone, caught by Letzgo Hunting, has just been sentenced to eight years. Anyone who said we were frauds, fakes or not interested in child protection, eat your words!’

And the girl’s mother said the group was ‘absolutely amazing’.

She insisted she would not have known her daughter had been abused if Letzgo Hunting had not investigated.

‘I saw there was a man talking to her, but the messages were quite innocent,’ she said.

‘Having seen these guys [Letzgo Hunting] through Facebook I went to them and asked for advice.’

She said she contacted the group and not the police because she was not sure at that stage if a crime had been committed.

The court heard Stone groomed the 15-year-old girl after meeting her in an online chatroom last February.

He pretended to be a 16-year-old boy and the pair formed a friendship before he persuaded her to send intimate pictures of herself.

They arranged to meet, with the girl later telling police: ‘The moment I saw him I was shocked. He looked like an older man and I just froze.’

Tina Dempster, prosecuting, told the court the victim had ‘got herself into a situation where she did not have the wherewithal to extricate herself’.

Stone took her to a bedsit above a pub in Nottingham city centre, where he persuaded her to take part in sexual activity, despite her telling him she was a virgin and didn’t want to.

Ms Dempster said the girl was left ‘hurt, stung and upset’ by what happened.

She told detectives: ‘I could not move. I felt numb. It was as if I wasn’t in my own body. I wanted my mum.’

The court heard the girl returned home and became ‘distressed and upset’ when she was questioned by her mother.

She told her she’d met a man she had thought was a boy, and her mother then discovered what had happened after searching online.

Ms Dempster said that the woman then contacted Letzgo Hunting, who weren’t referred to by name in court, for ‘support’.

The CPS said that as Stone admitted his guilt early in the proceedings, no evidence from Letzgo Hunting was presented in court.

Sentencing him, Judge Joan Butler QC said Stone had taken advantage of a girl lacking in self-esteem and ‘went about a campaign of grooming’.
