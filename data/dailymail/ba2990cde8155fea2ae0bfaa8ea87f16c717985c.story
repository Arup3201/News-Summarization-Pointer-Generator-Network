The Duchess of Cambridge cemented her status as a senior royal today as she led one of the tables at the Westminster Hall lunch today held in honour of the Queen.

After a reception at Guildhall, Kate was one of a number of royals including 
Charles and Camilla who attended the  City of London Livery companies lunch, held for some
 700 guests representing abundant trades and professions,
 ranging from grocers and gunmakers to fruiterers and fishmongers.

Kate was placed at the Master Glovers and Pattenmakers table, a body 
founded in the 17th century as a trade association for the makers of
 pattens - under-shoes of wood and metal which were worn strapped 
beneath the shoes to raise the wearer out of the mud on the streets.

Prince
 William was at the Engineers and Arbitrators table, while Harry took his place at the Fruiterers and 
Gardeners table.

Guests at the lunch dined on marinated Uist Island salmon with Lyme Bay crab, followed by 
saddle of Welsh Cambrian Mountain lamb with braised shoulder of lamb, 
grilled Isle of Wight asparagus, Jersey Royal potatoes and an aptly 
named Jubilee sauce.

Enjoying the day: It was a day of ceremony and 
respect, but for Kate and William it was also a time to celebrate the 
Queen's incredible reign

Earlier in the day, Kate looked 
stunning as she attended the Queen's thanksgiving service at St Paul's 
cathedral today in a nude lace dress by Alexander McQueen.

Kate
 wore the demure dress with a matching hat by Jane Taylor, a milliner 
fast becoming a firm favourite with the royals, and nude LK Bennett 
heels.

It was the third 
time she has worn an Alexander McQueen piece this weekend, having chosen
 something from the label, the same designer behind her lace wedding 
dress, at every Jubilee weekend celebration so far, from her red pageant
 outfit to the coat she wore over her Whistles dress for last night's 
concert.

The hat's designer, Jane Taylor, who also saw the Countess of Wessex wear one of her hats today said she was 'delighted'. 

'Both the Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex look stunning today.

'They both have a unique yet timeless sense of style and wear hats so well.

'It's the dream to have two members of they royal family wearing my pieces to such an important event.'

Kate and William were welcomed at the 
cathedral today by hundreds of well-wishers who had gathered outside the
 cathedral ahead of today's service in which the Archbishop of 
Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will give the sermon to mark the Queen's 
60 years on the throne.

The Duke of Cambridge wore a morning suit to today's service to mark the Diamond Jubilee.

As
 one of the senior royals, Kate walked alongside William down the long 
aisle of St Paul's cathedral just ahead of the Queen as the monarch 
arrived for today's service.

Just
 behind Kate and William walked the Prince of Wales and Duchess of 
Cornwall, with the Queen making her way down at the back of the royal 
procession.

Well, today the boats were well and truly pushed out. For the service at St Paul’s the Queen wore a soft mint coat dress: as for the flotilla on Sunday, it is again designed by her dresser, Angela Kelly. It is of silk tulle, embroidered with flowers, using silver thread. A chiffon drape is a lovely, soft touch: it is studded with Swarovski crystals, and a matching drape adorns the hat. 

The Duchess of Cambridge’s nude lace dress by Sarah Burton for McQueen was tailored perfectly to fit her figure – the hem a tad longer than the red dress for the flotilla on the Thames – and while I loved it, the fastening of the belt, seemingly made from bias binding, is a little disappointing. Kate (and Sarah Burton) need to understand that the Duchess will often be seen from behind, and therefore the detailing needs to be beautiful:  pearls or diamonds, with hand embroidered loops, not just a hook and eye.

and I do want to wrestle Kate out of her platform patent pumps from LK Bennett. She needs delicate lace shoes, encrusted with pearls, by Manolo Blahnik, say, or an English shoe couturier, such as Georgina Goodman. The platform is a little too casual for such a formal occasion.But Kate still looked stunning, especially as her eye make-up has been softened: I love the subtle veil over her eyes, on a hat by her favourite milliner, Jane Taylor: £790, available on the milliner’s website.

The real surprise of the day was that both Beatrice and Eugenie looked fresh, young and appropriate. Beatrice wore a blue and white striped coatdress by London Fashion Week designer Kinder Aggugini. Italian born, he studied at St Martin’s, and learned his craft on Savile Row and working for designers including Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano.

This dress was teamed with tan stilettos by Gina, a Stephen Jones hat and a Lemaresca bag, made by sisters Giulia and Cecilia Maresca, who worked at Tod’s and Vivienne Westwood before striking out on their own. This rock and roll bag label is made from start to finish in Italy, not merely ‘finished’ there, as so many are these days. This bag would have cost about £1,000.

Princess Eugenie chose a royal purple dress by Suzannah (her lovely, small boutique is at 6 Bristol Gardens, in Little Venice); a Stephen Jones hat; Gina nude stilettos and a Loro Piana bag. I am starting to love these two young women: they champion brand new talent, know how to mix and match different labels, and have the good sense to wear Gina shoes, which are expensive but super stylish and comfy. Kate should follow suit, and abandon those high street platforms. She has such great legs: she really could take a dagger heel.

Samantha Cameron wore a rose print dress by Paul Smith that we’ve seen before, but at least she wore a hat, by Stephen Jones. The Duchess of Cornwall wore a graphic, basket weave coat by Bruce Oldfield, and a ginormous Philip Treacy hat. Both items tell me she is feeling much more confident, starting to abandon those safe creams. All in all, a triumph.
