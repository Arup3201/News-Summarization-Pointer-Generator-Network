Under George Osborne's proposals, people aged 18 to 21 would have six months to find a job or training

Radical plans to ban young people getting the dole and slash the maximum amount of state benefits per household by £60 a week will be introduced if the Tories win next year’s General Election.

George Osborne plans to use the savings to pay for three million apprenticeships for young workers and end youth unemployment.

Under the Chancellor’s proposals, people aged 18 to 21 would be given six months to find a job or training – after which their dole would be scrapped unless they agreed to take part in ‘community projects’, such as cleaning up parks.

In addition they will not be allowed to claim housing benefit, forcing more youngsters to live at home with their parents.

Attempts by Mr Osborne to introduce similar measures have been blocked by Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. But he will forge ahead if the Tories win power outright next May.

In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, the Chancellor said: ‘Our mission is not just to save the pounds here and there, we’re trying to change the welfare system so it doesn’t trap people in poverty and a culture of dependency.

‘It is a tragedy for them and a waste for the country.’

Defending the housing benefit ban for under-21s, he said: ‘It is not acceptable for young people under the age of 21 to go straight from school on to benefits and into a home paid for through housing benefit – benefit funded by other people who are working.’

Single parents and young people coming out of care and other ‘vulnerable’ groups would be exempt.

And cutting dole for under-21s would encourage more to find work and help abolish youth unemployment, he argued.

‘We are saying you will receive an allowance but if you can’t find work after six months, you will have to work for the dole. They are difficult decisions but the right ones.’

Mr Osborne also plans to reduce the maximum benefit cap from the current level of £26,000 per household to £23,000. He believes it will encourage more people claiming benefits to find work.

‘Before our reforms, some families were receiving £100,000 a year in housing benefit. How many working people can afford rent of £100,000? It was a gross injustice. Since we imposed a cap, large numbers have looked for work.’

Opinion polls consistently show large public support for tackling welfare abuse.

However, Labour claim the new cuts are a ‘fresh attack on the poor’. A Labour aide said: ‘The Tories are wrong to think they can win easy votes by attacking people on welfare. The Bedroom Tax is massively unpopular and now they are attacking young people.

‘It is not the fault of under-21s that they cannot find work. It is Osborne’s fault for not having policies to create jobs for them.’

The dole, officially called the Job Seeker’s Allowance (JSA) is currently worth £50.95 per week for those aged 16 to 24 and £64.30 for the over-25s.

Mr Osborne intends to scrap the JSA for 18 to 21s and replace it with a ‘youth allowance’ – set at about the same level as the dole.

But they will only receive it for six months. After that, if they have failed to find a job, apprenticeship or a training scheme, they will have to do community work, such as cleaning up public places, to continue receiving it.

When the Tories came to power there were 250,000 18-21-year-olds on JSA. The figure has fallen to 150,000.

The new apprenticeships will be paid for out of savings from cutting the household benefit cap to £23,000.

A Tory official said: ‘Doing daily community work will help young people gain useful experience of the world of work and enable them to put something back into their community too. There will be no option to continue on benefits if this offer is refused.’
