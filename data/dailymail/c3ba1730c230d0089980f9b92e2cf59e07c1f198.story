Scotland's Martin Laird leads the Frys.com Open in California by a shot after carding a second straight five-under 67.

The 31-year-old Glaswegian has taken seven weeks off the Tour but has returned as though he has never been away.

A run of four straight birdies from eight through to 11 means he leads Bae Sang-moon and Zach Blair by a stroke on 10 under.

Scotland's Martin Laird was impressive again in the second round to take the lead by one shot at ten under

Laird has take time away from the Tour, but two rounds of 67 have given him the lead on his return

'You never know how you're going to play after seven weeks off like I had,' Laird said afterwards.

'Just to come out and put back-to-back 67s up and play very solid - very solid 67s - I'm extremely happy.'

American Scott Langley is next on the leaderboard on eight under, sharing the third spot with Sweden's David Lingmerth and compatriot Mark Hubbard. The 25-year-old Hubbard was one of two players to record a hole in one on Friday, going straight in on the par-three seventh.

His round of 65 was a low for the day, although the other player to make a one-shotter, Billy Hurley III, failed to make the cut.

Mark Hubbard is in third place on eight under, after the American made one of two holes in one on Friday

Lee Westwood somewhat made up for a poor first day with his second round of 69 on Friday

USA Ryder Cup player Hunter Mahan is one of a number on six under par, with Matt Kuchar back on five under.

Lee Westwood was three under on Friday, allowing him to repair some of the damage of a disappointing first day but even still he remains eight shots off Laird's pace.

Defending champion Jimmy Walker made sure he survived into the weekend with a stellar six-under round repairing the damage of a three-over 75 on day one.
