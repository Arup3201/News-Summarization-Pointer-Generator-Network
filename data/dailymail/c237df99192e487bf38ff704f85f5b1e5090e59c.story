'Lawfully killed': An inquest into the death of Mark Duggan, 29, said he had been 'lawfully killed' by police but they were criticised over the way they dealt with intelligence. The IPCC said it is pursuing 'a number of significant lines of inquiry'

Police firearms officers are to be banned from conferring after fatal shootings in the wake of the death of Mark Duggan.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is drawing up guidance to stop the practice of allowing marksmen to discuss what happened before they produce statements.

The police watchdog announced the move yesterday as it apologised to the Duggan family for releasing wrong details about his death.

Conferring over notes is currently allowed in guidelines set out by the Association of Chief Police Officers.

But there have been a number of attempts to stop firearms officers comparing notes following a series of high-profile police shootings, including that of barrister Mark Saunders who was killed during a siege in London in 2008.

His family tried to have an IPCC investigation into his killing ruled unlawful because officers talked among themselves before providing statements.

They failed, although Mr Justice Underhill agreed that conferring opened the gates for institutionalised collusion.

Mark Duggan’s family sought a judicial review of police protocol on the issue, but were unsuccessful.

Now the IPCC – which has itself called three times for conferring to end – wants the Home Secretary to sign off statutory guidance forcing officers to separate before they give statements on fatal incidents, including deaths in custody.

IPCC deputy chairman Rachel Cerfontyne said: ‘We will expect police officers to comply with it.’

The IPCC is still pursuing lines of inquiry following the conclusion of Duggan’s inquest last week. Investigators want to talk to officers involved in the case who have refused to be interviewed in person.

The gangster was shot by a Scotland Yard marksman in August 2011. The inquest jury found he was lawfully shot, despite not having a gun in his hand.

The IPCC was criticised for failing to contact his family in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, and for initially wrongly telling journalists he had fired a shot.

Rachel Cerfontyne, deputy chairwoman of the police watchdog, revealed the body is trying to speak to officers who have either so far refused to be interviewed or who have given conflicting accounts of what happened.

Although the inquest concluded that 
Mr Duggan had been 'lawfully killed' it criticised the Metropolitan 
Police and Serious Organised Crime Agency over its intelligence 
regarding the 29-year-old collecting the gun.

The
 inquest finished last week but the IPCC is still trying to clarify 
inconsistencies over how the police acted by speaking to people who have
 given information that contradicts 'other evidence'.

It
 is set to issue new guidance that will ban officers from conferring 
before giving statements in the aftermath of fatal shootings.

The
 police watchdog has apologised to the family of Mark Duggan, whose 
death sparked the London riots of 2011. Ms Cerfontyne said she 
'sincerely apologised' for the media being 'wrongly' told he had fired 
at police before he was shot.

She
 stressed the watchdog is determined to speak to witnesses who have so 
far refused or have given potentially misleading information.

'We
 expect police officers to cooperate fully with us if required, 
including answering questions at interview, something they have so far 
refused to do.”

Mr 
Duggan’s family and their lawyers met with chairwoman of the IPCC Anne 
Owers and Ms Cerfontyne on Tuesday to discuss the watchdog’s 
investigation.

Relatives of
 the father-of-six were left furious at the inquest finding that he was 
lawfully shot by police, despite not having a gun in his hand at the 
time.

The
 IPCC was also heavily criticised for failing to contact his family in 
the immediate aftermath of the shooting, and for initially wrongly 
telling journalists that he had fired a shot.

Ms
 Cerfontyne added: 'We know that the family’s confidence in us and our 
investigation was damaged by mistakes made in the early stages - both in
 relation to inaccurate information we provided to the media, and the 
initial management of the incident.

'I
 would like again to record my sincere apology to them that on the 
evening that Mark was fatally shot by a police officer a member of our 
staff wrongly led the media to believe that he had fired at police 
officers. I fully understand the damaging impact of this.”

'This inquest and our own review of the way we investigate deaths show the problems that can arise when officers confer when writing up their notes following fatal incidents,' she said.

'We have therefore decided to issue our own statutory guidance on post-incident management following death or serious injury. The guidance will cover conferring and the separation of officers. Legally, we have to consult on the content of this guidance.

'Once agreed by the Home Secretary, we will expect police officers to comply with it, and call them to account if they do not.'

Police believed he planned to collect a gun from another man, Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, and then go on to Broadwater Farm, also in Tottenham.

Officers involved in the case have refused to be interviewed in person by the IPCC, only agreeing to answer questions in writing.

Dame Anne Owers said their failure to co-operate had delayed the inquiry by nearly a year.

Deb Coles, from the charity Inquest that has backed Mr Duggan’s family since his death, said: 'I think the failure of police officers to agree to be interviewed is one of the most contentious issues following deaths in police custody.

'It’s one that has caused serious concern and frustration among bereaved families.

'If you are a citizen you have the right to silence but an inference can be drawn from it, and you would be pursued. It wouldn’t be the same for a police officer who fails to co-operate and just gets on with their life.'
