You might think the secret to a long life is eating healthily and staying away from alcohol. 

But residents in a Chinese village where most people live into their 90s disagree. 

In fact they say there is nothing better than a good argument, hard work and a drink.

Yu Fangyin, 99, drinks more than 10kgs of rice wine every month and leads a peaceful life in Shuping, according to People's Daily Online. 

Residents from Shuping in China have given their opinions on what leads to a long life. Yu Fangyin (above), 99, says the key to longevity is a good drink

His daughter-in-law Wang Jiaxiang said it is drinking and smoking that keeps Mr Fangyin happy.

She said: 'Apart from these he has no other interests. He is very healthy, is rarely ill, and is a bit of a celebrity in the village.' 

Mr Fangyin is feeling so healthy that he is hoping to find a wife, jokingly saying that he will start looking 'next year after my 100th birthday'.

As far as Chen Zhenglan, 93, is concerned it is not getting married but having an argument that is best.

She continually rebuffs her husband Li Changgui, 89, over breakfast about what they are going to eat for dinner.

Her claims are backed up by the couple's son Li Tianshun, who said his parents have argued all of their lives with most situations ending with his mother making a compromise. 

When he spoke to the reporter the 60-year-old said: 'It’s actually good today. The old man doesn’t have much of a huff otherwise he would have walked out already.

'Arguments are part of life. This may be another way to express their love as well as the secret to their longevity.' 

Most people living in the village reach their 90s. Li Shangui (third from right), 95, says hard work is the best way to stay young, as long as you love your job

The pair met when Mr Changgui was a blacksmith. Mrs Zhenglan said she fell for him and added: 'I am older than him and more mature.'

Others in the village attribute a healthy life to hard graft. 

Li Shangui is 95. She was director of the Women's Association before she started making and mending shoes. In her spare time she helps her family complete their chores.

Her daughter Hu Zhenggui said: 'Her eyes and ears are still very sharp.'

Her great daughter-in-law Ceng Changping added: 'I tried to learn how to mend the soles of shoes a number of times but sadly I couldn’t figure it out.' 

Wu Liangfu also believes in working hard. The 104-year-old works as a tailor at his house, as he has done for many years.

The former soldier said he likes doing things in an orderly fashion as well as reminiscing about the past.

'It is through constant recalling of memories do they become ingrained and your mind will not become dumb,' he explained. 

'I love seeing all my children and grandchildren having good jobs.' 

He said a good mood, maintaining good relations with everyone and not arguing were also key. 

Mr Liangfu's son added: 'My father was a soldier and an old revolutionary and whenever the subject of war appears he will talk about it for a long time and we all patiently listen to his old stories.

Mrs Zhenglan mostly argues with her husband over breakfast (above), allegedly about what they are going to eat for dinner

Wu Liangfu, 104, also keeps busy and enjoys working with string, nimbly creating designs with his own hands

'Dad said to me once that a family that is harmonious will see the elders age with dignity, the young grow well, everyone’s mood will be good and longevity will come naturally.'

Villagers added that Ms Shangui and Mr Liangfu's success has led them to believe in the mantra: 'Those who love their work have long lives. It’s an honour to work.'
