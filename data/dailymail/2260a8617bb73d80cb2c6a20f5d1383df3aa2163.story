Uber drivers protesting unfair working conditions and poor fares protested outside the company's Long Island City offices Monday.

Most of the drivers are either SUV or black car operators and planned the protest after refusing to drive for Uber and in some cases going so far as to jump to rival business Lyft.

This is the second protest Uber Drivers Network NYC will stage against the company in a week.

The strikers urged drivers to support them by shuting off their phones or refusing any Uber requests.

Other drivers have posted about the strike to the company's Facebook, though Uber quickly deleted the posts.

Buzzfeed reports that one of the driver's major issues is that Uber slashed driver's wages by extending summer discounts into the fall.

They also complain that SUV and black car drivers have been forced to take lower rates for UberX riders - a non luxury counterpart to the company's black car service that carries a lower rate.

Drivers said that by using taking UberX passengers they were making less than they would working only as a black car driver.

And though they've attempted to opt out and work only as premium driver, they continue to receive UberX requests.

If they take only SUV or black car requests, Uber could assign them low rider acceptance rates or temporarilly suspend them.

'Uber is basically abusing the driver,' said one driver who asked to be referred to as only Belal. 'They give us a 24 hour suspension and threaten that you will lose your 
chance with Uber. To get a ride for $8.00, I’ll have to work the whole 
day. Gas and insurance for SUV’s are expensive. I have to pay $80 to 
$100 a day in gas.'

He said since the company reduced fares in July to try and beat yellow cab UberX requests have skyrocketed.

'They make us work for UberX permanently because we received tons of 
UberX calls per minute,' Belal said. 'This means we never get the chance to
 accept black car or SUV cars. We can only pick UberX. It’s a strategy 
for them to put us to work only for UberX.

'They’ll forget that Uber drivers have been doing this business for 20
 years,' he added. 'They have more experience than Uber and all the 
management of Uber. And Uber is not a company it’s an application. The 
value of Uber, it’s our value. We are Uber. We are the ones who are 
offering the service. Uber is not doing anything, it’s an application on
 the phone. Uber didn’t pay for our cars. Uber is only a connection.'

But it remains to be seen if the strike will have any effect, as Belal agreed that management did not seem bothered by the protest.

'They said to take it or leave it,' he said.

The drivers may not be able to exert real pressure on the company as many of them who bought a car specifically to become Uber drivers will likely have to continue contracting regardless of the company's fare changes. 

But it remains to be seen if the strike will have any effect, as drivers agreed that management did not seem bothered by the protest.

'We get expensive cars, most of the drivers if they give it back to 
the bank they’ll lessen their credit score,' Belal told Buzzfeed. 'Uber right now
 is putting us in a dangerous situation. We’re not making a living but 
they’re pushing us to give back the cars.'

Even those drivers without luxury cars are feeling squeezed as Uber's rates - while a good deal for riders - force them to work longer hours with no tips for what they could make in normal hours as a taxi driver.

'The average driver was putting in 2 or 3 hours extra a day to make 
the same money they were making before reduced prices…When they switched
 the prices as an X driver, I’m hardly paying my bills, [I’m] working 8 
to 10 hours a day, six days a week,' said a driver who drove a Toyota Camry. 'I have to pay for tolls and 
gas… [and make] $7 to 800 a week — which is not enough any more.'

Claim Uber's attempts to undercut taxi prices is making it impossible to earn a living

With many cars leased specifically to work for Uber, drivers may have little bargaining power and be forced to accept wages less than they would make as normal taxi drivers
