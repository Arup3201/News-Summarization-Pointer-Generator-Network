When baby Isaac Curtis was born struggling to breathe, doctors decided he needed immediate specialist treatment.

He was whisked away from his parents to two different hospitals hundreds of miles away as doctors fought to save his life.

But the family were able to be reunited closer to home after the Children's Air Ambulance took Isaac back safely to his local hospital in Somerset in a specialist 'baby pod' which enabled him to breathe.

Tiny Isaac wore miniature ear defenders for his helicopter trip, which took him 170 miles from Leicester to Musgrove Hospital, Taunton, in just 59 minutes.

First flight: Baby Isaac had tiny ear defenders strapped to his head for the helicopter journey

Transfer: The Children's Air Ambulance was called to fly Isaac from Leicester Glenfield Hospital, where he was having life-saving treatment, to Taunton Musgrove Hospital so he could be close to his family

Doctors first became concerned about Isaac's condition moments after birth when it was clear he was in severe respiratory distress and had lung tissue damage.

He was diagnosed with acute meconium aspiration - caused when the baby breathes in its own waste products during birth - after a long two-day labour.

Paramedics immediately drove him to Bristol Royal Infirmary where he was put on a mechanical ventilator to clear his lungs, but doctors told his mother Rebecca he was unlikely to survive the 50-mile journey and that she should prepare for the worst.

Although Isaac did make the journey the ventilator was not effective, so consultants at the hospital called in a specialist team from Leicester Glenfield Hospital.

The team brought the only mobile ECMO - or Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation - machine in the country, which artificially pumps blood and oxygen around the body.

Safe: Isaac was put into a specialist baby pod where he was kept attached to breathing equipment throughout the flight

On the mend: Isaac is now back home and is expected to make a full recovery with no long-term side effects

They then took Isaac to the Leicester hospital where he spent two nights having ECMO treatment and started responding well.

Mrs Curtis and her husband had 
followed their son up the country by car, but as travelling was 
difficult after her problematic labour, she was thrilled to learn Isaac 
would be returning home to Taunton.

The baby was stabilised in the 
Children's Air Ambulance baby pod before being flown by pilots Shaun 
Tinkler Rose and Paul Hogan back to Somerset, while his parents took the
five-hour journey by road.

Growing strong: Isaac is now back home with mother Rebecca Curtis where he is using an oxygen tube to help his lungs recover

Mrs Curtis said it was incredibly hard to put her baby in the hands of the helicopter crew, but she was reassured when they let her on board to take pictures before they took off, and because they called her regularly to let her know how it was going.

She said: 'I knew he was in the best hands and it was the best parting from Isaac I could have had.'

After three weeks' further treatment in the Taunton hospital, Isaac is back home and doing well, although he is still on oxygen.

He is expected to make a full recovery with no long-term side effects.

Mrs Curtis now plans to run a half marathon next year to raise money for the Children's Air Ambulance as a thank-you.

She said: 'The Children’s Air Ambulance provides an amazing service and we are so grateful that they were there to help Isaac when he needed them most.'

The Children’s Air Ambulance is the only helicopter ambulance service in England and Wales solely dedicated to transferring critically ill children and babies to specialist hospitals and is fitted with paediatric equipment.

The charity, which is entirely funded by public donations, got its first helicopter in October 2012. The helicopter is an Agusta Grand 109S which can reach speeds of up to 200mph.

Nearly two thirds of the children which are helped by the air ambulance are under three months old.
