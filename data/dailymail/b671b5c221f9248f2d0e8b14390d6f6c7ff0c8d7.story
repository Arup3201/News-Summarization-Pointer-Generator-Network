A 14-year-old boy in Mexico was diagnosed with a rare condition, gerascophobia - an excessive fear of ageing (picture posed by model)

A 14-year-old boy was so terrified of growing up he took extreme steps to curb his physical growth, stopping eating and distorting his voice.

The teenager also adopted a stooped posture to appear shorter and scoured the internet to learn how not to ejaculate.

A new report, in which experts discuss his case, reveals the boy's phobia started when he was around 12 years old.

Having learned nutrients in food would cause him to grow, the boy ate less, and lost more than 26lbs (12kg) - almost two stone - in the process.

Specialists at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, in northern Mexico, diagnosed the boy with gerascophobia - an excessive fear of ageing.

They noted the teenager 'felt his body development was a threat, to the point where he took extreme measures to stop or otherwise hide growth'.

The report reveals: 'Every time he notices a physical change that indicates that he is growing, he feels fear and anxiety, to the point that he has considered undergoing multiple surgeries to hide it.

'If people tell him that he is taller or older, he becomes extremely upset and cries.' 

The psychiatrists assessing the teenager noted he had a history of separation anxiety, dating back to when he was five.

They also revealed he was sexually abused by a neighbour as a six-year-old, and suffered regular bullying.

The researchers said all three factors caused the boy to suffer anxiety and depression and focus his attention on certain physical characteristics.

However the teenager argued the expectations adults face as they get older are 'excessive', for example, getting a partner, being independent, and having more responsibility and financial solvency.

The report adds: 'He also believes that once he reaches that age, he is more likely to get sick and die, all of which are very overwhelming.' 

The psychiatrists assessing the boy said after carrying out a number of searches they found only one other article where two similar cases of a fear of ageing are reported.

Despite the diagnosis, other medical professionals told Livescience they might have put the teenager's condition down to body dysmorphic or gender dysmorphic disorders.

Martin Antony, a professor in psychology at Ryerson University in Toronto said: 'Somebody else might well diagnose this as a different problem than what the authors have.' 

Meanwhile Dr Luis Gonzalez Mendoza, director of paediatric endocrinology at Miami Children's Hospital agreed.

The boy went to extreme lengths to try and prevent himself growing up, stopping eating, stooping to appear shorter and distorting his voice to speak in a higher tone, specialists analysing his case revealed. Pictured, a statue of the character Peter Pan, the boy who never grew up 

He attributed the boy's symptoms to gender dysmorphia, where a person fails to identify with his or her biological gender, and fear puberty because they don't recognise their changing bodies. 

The teenage boy was treated by doctors at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León with the antidepressant fluoxetine.

He also underwent psychotherapy and family therapy.

The treatment appeared successful, with the boy standing upright and speaking in his natural tone of voice.

His attitude to food also improved, and he gained 13lbs (6kg) - almost a stone. 

The report added: 'He is able to imagine the future, living on his own and working as an actor, and this is an idea he likes; he continues to express a fear of commitment and responsibilities that he feels will be required of him in adult life.' 

The report was published in the journal Case Reports in Psychiatry.
