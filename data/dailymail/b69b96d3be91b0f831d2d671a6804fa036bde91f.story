Darlene Curley and her 16-year-old daughter were on a walk along Daytona Beach on Sunday morning about 7am - one last stroll on the sand before jumping in the car and heading back to their home in Tennessee following a family vacation.

But then they stumbled across a woman's purse that had washed up on the shore, and couldn't believe what they found inside.

Next to a few other belongings, such as some shoes and a towel, there was a bank bag with $13,000 cash inside.

It was $13,087.88 to be exact.

Give and you shall receive?: Darlene Curley (center), seen in a family photo, surely has some good karma heading her way after returning over $13,000 to its owner. She said she was more worried something that had happened to them, suspecting they had drowned

After holidaying here, Daytona Beach, Florida, with family, not everyone would have handed over the $13,000 cash they found on the final day of vacation

While many may have grappled with what action to take - keep it, or perhaps take some it and pretend it had drifted away - Mrs Churley, from the small suburb of Etowah, called police.

'We were more worried someone might have drowned or something,' she told WPTV.

'Here we were all their things in the water.'

Beach Safety Ocean Rescue responded to the call and put the items inside a lifeguard station to dry.

It was them who counted the money in the bank and came up with the final total.

The money was found in a purse by U.S. label Coach, which was worth about $400 and similiar to this one

Darlene Curley had been vacationing with her family at this Daytona Beach hotel, the Super 8 at 700 N. Atlantic Ave, when, just before leaving, she found a purse washed ashore

They locked the lifeguard bay and left two officers behind to guard it.

Good Samaritan Darlene said he never questioned her decision.

Having been on holiday, she said she couldn't imagine losing that kind of money herself.

'We wanted to make sure they got all their money because, you known, that may have been all the money they had,' she said.

The money - which was inside a purse by American luxury goods label Coach, valued around $400 - was eventually claimed.

A police report shows the person who collected it was 'May Self' of Harwood, Maryland.

It is understood the name is a pseudonym.

Mrs Curley said that May Self called her to say thank you and asked to meet in person.
