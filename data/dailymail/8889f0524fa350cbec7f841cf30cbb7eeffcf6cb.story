A man shed a quarter of his body weight after he was jokingly nicknamed 'Fatboy' by friends during a trip up one of Britain's highest mountains.

Dave Burn, from Essex, who weighed 18st, was attempting to scale Mount Snowdon in Wales with friends to celebrate his 45th birthday but he had to give up just a third of the way up the 3,500 peak - and took the train to the top instead.

Despite his early cop out, Dave, now 49, was so exhausted he slept through his birthday night out and was unable to drive home the next day due to aches and pains in his legs - and on his return had to take four days off work.

Dave recalled: 'We took a photo of me at the top and the lads called me Fatboy Snowdon. That night all I could do was sleep, I missed my birthday night out, and the next day my friend had to drive the car home as my legs were killing me.' 

As a result of the incident, he vowed to get fit, cut out the takeaways and he enrolled on an annual week-long boot camp in Marbella. 

Since then he has completed 10k races in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the London to Paris bike ride and even trekked to the base camp of Mount Everest.

He has shed four stone, dropped from a XXXL clothes size to a large and lost ten inches from his waistline - and vowed never to get overweight again.

Dave, from Barking in Essex, who has three children and one grandchild, said: 'When I look back I really hated who I was before. But now, I'm happy in my skin. I had to declare war on Fatboy Snowdon and that I was going to win.'

Dave went to Prestige Boot Camp in Marbella and dropped a stone in his first week. Dave said: 'It was so hard. I went from doing nothing to training for eight hours a day, but I was determined to get through it'

Dave, who runs an electrical business, initially realised he would have to take action about his weight when he went for a medical check-up and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.

He added: 'I knew I was out of shape but I'd never had a day off work in my life so never thought anything was wrong.

'When the doctor said to me I had diabetes I was gobsmacked. He told me I'd be fine if I managed it with pills.

'I didn't want that and said to him, "No, I'll lose weight." He said, "You've got no chance!"

'According to him, statistically the amount of obese people who turn their life around is virtually zero and I was facing a lifetime of popping pills.

'I went away feeling totally depressed.' 

After his appointment, he vowed to get fit and went to see a trainer and nutritionist for advice.

First, Dave started running, setting himself the challenge of completing a 10k race in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

He went to the Prestige Boot Camp in Marbella and dropped a stone in his first week.

Dave said: 'It was so hard. I went from doing nothing to training for eight hours a day, but I was determined to get through it. I was always the fat lad at the back of the group, whether it was circuits or a walk, but everyone there was supportive and kept me going.

'The first night I remember actually weeping in the shower, it was like my whole body was crying from the shock.

'I knew I couldn't run away. The prospect of taking more and more pills as I got older was not what I wanted. I wanted to be healthy and live to see a decent age.'

Dave recalled: 'We took a photo of me at the top', left, 'and the lads called me Fatboy Snowdon. That night all I could do was sleep, I missed my birthday night out, and the next day my friend had to drive  home as my legs were killing me'

Dave, who is married to Wendy, 45, and father to Ronnie, 26, Mikayla, 22, and Leigh, 20, and has a two-year-old granddaughter called Maycee, overhauled his diet too. 

He said: 'Before I went to boot camp I didn't have a clue about nutrition and I was a mess. I remember looking at the trainer, Iain Reitze, who is the same age as me and just wanting to feel good.

'As well as the sessions, he educated us about the right foods to fuel our body and make us feel better physically and emotionally too.'

Before his lifestyle overhaul, Dave would have a fry-up for breakfast, followed by a chocolate bar as a snack, then a sandwich and crisps for lunch. 

'He would then have a Mars bar or a French stick to keep him going in the afternoon and either a Chinese or Indian takeaway or a kebab for dinner.

Now, he has porridge for breakfast, an apple mid-morning, chicken salad for lunch, a banana mid-afternoon then chicken, tofu or even just vegetables for dinner.

Dave said: 'I learned to eat well every two hours or so rather than having rubbish. A few years back, if you'd said I'd be eating tofu, I'd have fallen over laughing. But now I like it and some nights we have just steamed veg for dinner and I still feel satisfied. 

'I went out with my wife last week and came down in my suit and she said to me, "You look hot".'
