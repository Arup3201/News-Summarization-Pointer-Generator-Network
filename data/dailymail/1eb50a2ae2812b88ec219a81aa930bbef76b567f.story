She may be a Oscar-winning actress with best-selling cookbooks and a popular lifestyle blog, but it seems Gywneth Paltrow is still not quite good enough for Yahoo's Marissa Mayer.

According to an article in the New York Times, the CEO  'balked' at the idea of hiring the Hollywood actress because she 'disapproved of the fact that Paltrow did not graduate college'.

The lengthy piece revealed that former Google executive Mayer, who had been drafted in to remake the once-great Yahoo, 'habitually asked deputies where they attended college'.

And according to one executive, the fact that Paltrow did not even graduate college was the major stumbling block to her being hired as a contributing editor for Yahoo Food.

The decision has been questioned by critics who label Mayer as 'a higher education snob' and point out that internet greats Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Reed, Harvard, and Harvard respectively.

Mayer, who graduated Stanford in 1997, was just 38 when she was hired by Yahoo in 2012 in a bid to turn around the fortunes of the floundering California-based internet corporation.

The initial appointment was met with huge amounts of hope and positivity, and Yahoo's stock was on the rise within Mayer's first six months on the job.

She embarked on a program of buying up start-ups (she outbid Facebook for Tumblr), generating more 'must-read' content, investigating content collaboration possibilities and hiring expensive journalists - including Joe Zee, the former creative director of Elle, and former New York Times gadget columnist David Pogue.

It was also Mayer who gave the greenlight a plan to hire Katie Couric, the former anchor of 'CBS Evening News' and former co-host of the 'Today' show.

But two years into the job and things aren't looking so rosy for Mayer.

Following a series of embarrassing management setbacks, Mayer has not succeeded in turning any of Yahoo’s many products into an industry leader, and a number of investors are questioning whether the company might be better off merging.

Paltrow, on the other hand, initially attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, but dropped out to begin her acting career and went on to Hollywood stardom with roles in films including Seven, Emma, Sliding Doors and The Talented Mr. Ripley.

The 42-year-old  now runs popular lifestyle blog Goop and says she plans to launch a line of apparel and beauty products.
