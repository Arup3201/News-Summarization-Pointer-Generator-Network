Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has admitted he learned to hate north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur during his eight-year stint under Arsene Wenger.

Henry, now a pundit for Sky Sports, is the club's record goalscorer and playing a huge part in their 'Invincibles' season of 2003-04 when the Premier League title was wrapped up with a draw at White Hart Lane.

The Frenchman is still a huge fan of the club and it is evident that he embraced the culture during his time in England.

Henry also says he had to fight for his place when he first arrived, calling Dennis Bergkamp a 'God'

'During my eight years there, something came into me,' Henry told l'Equipe. 'I have learned the culture of this club... I learned to hate Tottenham.' 

Henry also added that Dennis Bergkamp was a 'God' at the club, as well as admitting he had to impose himself upon arriving at Arsenal as well as Barcelona.

'We often forget that when I arrived at Arsenal, it was to follow Nicolas Anelka. Not easy at all. No matter that he went to Real Madrid, he will forever remain in my eyes one of the best strikers with whom I played.

'I would have loved to play in the club with him as I would have also liked to do with Paul Scholes and Steven Gerrard. When I arrived, I found myself competing with Davor Suker, Nwankwo Kanu with God - and God is at Arsenal Dennis Bergkamp.

'If I had not come to impose myself, I would have had to go left and fight for a place with Marc Overmars. In short, I had to get up early. At first, nothing was easy. When I arrived in Barcelona, ​​it was the same - I was nobody.'
