Three pilots flying together to a safety conference died when their single-engine plane faltered in mid-air before crashing into a house that went up in flames.

The three men had just taken off from Hawkins Field Airport in Jackson, Mississippi on Tuesday when a witness said the Piper PA-32 began 'spitting and sputtering'.

They have been identified as John Tilton, WC Young, and David Williams, all civil air patrolmen.

One of the pilots asked for permission to return to the airport, but just minutes later the plane went down.

It crashed through trees before slamming 
into a house that caught fire, sending flames and black smoke through 
the neighborhood of modest single-family homes.

The county coroner said dental records or DNA would be needed to confirm the victims' identities.

A deputy fire chief said one person escaped 
the burning home with minor injuries and was in good condition at University of Mississippi Medical Center.

The men on board were headed to a Federal Aviation Administration safety conference less than 30 miles away.

The plane was owned by Roger and Michele
Latham, from Superior Pallet Company in Flowood, both of whom showed up
at the crash site, along with their daughter Emily.

Mrs Latham said all three men on board were pilots. Mr Latham, who is 15 hours short of getting his pilot's license, identified one of the victims as John Edward Tilton Jr, his flight instructor.

'He was one of the finest Christian men I knew,' Mr Latham said. 'We had three great men who lost their lives.

'I just want to wake up in a while and say, ''This didn't happen.'"

Emily Latham said her father was supposed to have been
on board but changed his plans.

‘He went hunting,’ she said. ‘Thank God.’

The plane had departed Hawkins Field Airport headed for Raymond, Mississippi, for an FAA safety conference.

Mr
Latham said his plane had been parked in a hangar for a month and they 
wanted to take it out for a short flight before he flew it to Gulf 
Shores, Alabama, for Thanksgiving.

Mr Latham said he had owned the plane for two and a half years and described it as being in mint condition.

Vivian Payne, who lives about six blocks from the crash site, said that at 5 pm, she heard a loud bang like an electrical transformer blowing.

‘It shook the walls of my house,’ Payne said as she stood among ambulances, police cars and fire trucks.

The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA were investigating.
