A Colorado artist has been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping an eight-year-old girl from her bedroom in Aurora.

John Stanley Snorsky, 26, was arrested on Tuesday morning following a separate incident of felony theft.

Following more than 200 tips, the Aurora Police Department arrived at probable cause to charge him with the kidnapping Friday.

He has been charged with first and second degree burglary and second degree kidnapping and is being held on $500,000 bond, police said at a press conference today.

The eight-year-old girl was brazenly taken from her bedroom on Monday night by the kidnapper, who cut the screen of an unlocked window.

According to Fox31, Snorsky allegedly pulled the screaming girl from the room and carried her to an alley behind the house.

Police say the kidnapper was trying to get the girl into his car when she managed to escape.

The girl's father, who was alerted by her screams, told police he saw the man drive away in what looked like a silver BMW.

He ran out of the home and found his daughter running back home from the alley behind the house, police said.

'This is a reminder... how important it is to make a lot of noise in these types of situations,' police said Saturday.

'She's very bright... very, very brave.'

The girl was examined at a local hospital and suffered only minor injuries.

She was able to give police a very accurate description of her abductor, resulting in a composite sketch that bears close resemblance to Snorsky.

The girl told police the man who abducted her had blond hair and smelled strongly of cigarettes.

It's unknown whether the kidnapping was random or if Snorsky had been watching the family and knew which was the little girl's bedroom.

Snorsky, is a 'self-taught' artist who has a Facebook page under the name Johnathan Artist featuring pictures of himself and his work.

Friends and acquaintances have commented on the page since news of his arrest, expressing surprise and in some cases, a lack thereof.

One wrote, 'I've known him since we were kids and I totally think he did it.'

'Omg I can’t even imagine what he was thinking!!! I’m at a loss for words right now,' wrote another.

ABC 7 reports that a friend of Snorsky contacted the publication to defend him.

'I know Johnathan, and he isn't bothered by many things. He is the most humble, loving, and caring person I have ever met in my life. He knows he did some bad things as a kid, which in turn led him to serve time in corrections - however there is only one thing... ONE THING that he will not stand for... and that is sex crimes, child abduction, or anything of the sort. I feel as if they were just looking for someone that fit the profile.'According to American Live Wire, Snorksy emigrated to the U.S. from Russia as a child and has a long rap sheet including arrests for burglary and escaping from prison.Snorsky works at a sub shop at 6th Ave and Sable Boulevard in Aurora and drives a silver-grey Mercedes, according to ABC 7.
