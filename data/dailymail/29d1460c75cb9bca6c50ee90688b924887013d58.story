It's arguably Paris's most iconic landmarks. However one couple got more than they bargained for when seeing the Eiffel Tower all lit up at night.

A creepy face at the top of the 988ft structure was caught on camera by holidaymaker Lisa Dingley, who travelled across the channel to celebrate her 32nd birthday.

She noticed the 'skull' while sitting on a wall with her boyfriend Philip Morgan at the entrance of Jardin des Tuileries - two miles from the famous landmark.

What an Eiffel! The top of the tower looks like a skull, or a 'creepy face' in Lisa's photo

Miss Dingley, of Birmingham, West Midlands, spotted the face straight away and thought it was a giant skull looking back at her.

She said: 'The face on top of the tower reminds me of a skull.

'I noticed that it looked like a face immediately and showed it to my partner, Philip.

'We were both amazed and had to look at it several times - it was clearly a face.

'I thought it looked creepy and I am sure some people will agree with me.

'Philip also thought it was a very strange photograph. Everyone who has seen it exclaims "there is a face!"'

The photograph was taken at 10pm, during the tower's first light show of the evening.
