The Ohio State Buckeyes made college football history on Monday as they stormed to National Championship victory  over Oregon in the first College Football Playoff Championship - but in the adrenaline-pumped excitement managed to trample one of their own cheerleaders as they ran onto the field. 

A cheerleader, who was enthusiastically shaking her pom-poms, ended up face-down on the field as she tried to scramble out the way of the rushing players.

The young woman had been carrying the 'O' flag to complete the waving banner for Ohio which also ended up being trampled into the field at Cowboy Stadium in Arlington, Texas. As she struggled to escape, one player then tripped over her, almost causing a domino-effect among the rushing team.

The cheerleader was rescued by a teammate and was reportedly fine following the incident, watching the game from the sidelines.  

Some 80,000 screaming fans turned out to the stadium to watch the tense game which saw Ohio crush the University of Oregon with a 42-20 win - a surprising victory for the underdog team which sparked wild celebrations in Columbus with around 40 small fires lit in the streets and police forced to use pepper-spray on some of the thousands of revelers.

Pushover: An Ohio State cheerleader was trampled by players from the team as they run onto the field ahead of the National Championships on Monday night in Arlington, Texas

Obstacle: As she hit the floor at Cowboy Stadium, the cheerleader immediately tried to get up (still clutching her pom-poms). However one of the players then tripped over her, causing a near disaster

Escape: In the end, one of her male teammates came to her rescue and pushed her away from the path of the team's tunnel. The young woman was reportedly fine following the incident and watched the game from the sidelines

The two teams were playing the first College Football Playoff championship in Arlington - and among those in the stands was basketball superstar (and Ohio State fan), LeBron James, who tweeted: 'On this bird celebrating a great night for OHIO!! THE Ohio State Buckeyes are National Champions!! #OH.'

Ohio blew away the Ducks, beating them 42-20 with third-choice quarterback Cardale Jones. Oregon had been considered the favorite in part due to their star quarterback Marcus Mariota, who won the Heisman Trophy this season.

Ohio State made it to the championship despite losing two talented quarterbacks to injuries this season and went into the game being very much seen as the underdogs. 

Ezekiel Elliott ran for 246 yards and four touchdowns for Ohio State, who become the first university to claim a national football title via a knock-out playoff competition.

The national collegiate title has long been a coveted commodity in a sport that sparks pride and passions across the United States often greater than those produced by professional teams.

But the one thing lacking from the spectacle has been the kind of playoffs so beloved of US sports enthusiasts -- head-to-head competitions that let fans point to the last team standing as true and deserving champions.

Instead, for decades, rankings or polls determined the national collegiate football champion. For the last 16 years, the Bowl Championship Series system pitted two top teams in a title game based on a combination of human polls and computer rankings.

This season, a selection committee of 13 chose and seeded four teams to play in semi-final games.

The University of Oregon steamrolled defending national champions Florida State 59-20 in the Rose Bowl, which served as one playoff semi-final.

Ohio State rallied to beat top-ranked Alabama 42-35 in the Sugar Bowl - which was the other semi-final game.

And on Monday, Ohio State powered past the Ducks in front of 85,689 fans at AT&T Stadium, the billion-dollar home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys.

Oregon boasted quarterback Marcus Mariota, winner of the coveted Heisman Trophy as the country's top collegiate player.

But it was the Buckeyes' second-year running back Elliott who starred, putting the game away with three touchdown runs in the second half.

Ohio State defender Eli Apple punctuated the victory by intercepting a Mariota pass on the final play of the game. 

The victory capped an improbable championship run for Ohio State, who lost star quarterback Braxton Miller before the season. Backup J.T. Barrett kept the ship on course, but broke his ankle in November, leaving third-string quarterback Cardale Jones to lead the Buckeyes to the Big Ten conference title and their Sugar Bowl victory.

Mariota threw two touchdown passes, including a seven-yard strike to Keanon Lowe on their opening drive.

Mariota connected with Byron Marshall on a 70-yard catch and run for a touchdown in the third that cut Ohio State's lead to 21-17 in the third.

Oregon's defense forced four turnovers, including two in the third quarter as the Ducks pulled within 21-20, but Ohio State responded with two touchdown drives to put the game out of reach.

Even before Monday's game the new playoff format had been widely hailed as a success.

The two semi-final games produced high-scoring, entertaining contests that drew more than 28 million television viewers apiece, sparking talk of expanding the playoffs from four to eight teams.

Following the surprise win, chaotic celebrations broke out in Columbus, Ohio as hundreds of fans gathered in the downtown streets with police struggling to keep order in a city gripped by football fever.

Police and SWAT teams dressed in full-camouflage gear and Kevlar helmets used tear gas to disperse the crowds after earlier urging fans to show they 'have class'. 

Thousands of fans cheering and blowing car horns converged on Ohio State University's stadium shortly after the win, only to be turned away by police.

That forced them back to an area of bars around the campus where most of the trouble took place, with between 30 and 40 fires lit in trash cans and dumpsters.

One image taken from social networks showed a man pouring fuel on to a sofa which sat burning in the middle of the road. 

Social media users posted images from the streets of SWAT teams marshaling crowds, and fires burning in the middle of intersections while patrol cars pushed through massed fans.

The Columbus Dispatch reported that pepper spray was used. Fox8 also obtained footage of fans crowding round police vehicles.

Local reporter Jeremy Pelzer uploaded a series of images showing the city's High Street purportedly being hit by tear gas after crowds couldn't be dispersed.

He wrote: 'Just saw an officer pepper spray a guy at point-blank range in the face when he was already on his knees in pain.'

He had previously pictured SWAT teams gathering on the streets, some of whom were wearing gas masks.

Amid the chaos there was time for some romantic scenes as one couple were pictured kissing, while other shots showed friends riding around on each-other's shoulders. 

A Buckeyes fan tweeted that SWAT teams were facing down fans on High Street, and also said he saw a car on fire. Earlier the Columbus Police Department implored fans to 'show the nation that [Columbus] has class.'

In a tweet they urged fans to 'Party responsibly!' and 'Stay safe!' They said that extra officers were posted on the streets to maintain order.
