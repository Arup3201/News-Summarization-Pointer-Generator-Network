A Philadelphia Fire Department paramedic has sparked outrage for posting a photo to Instagram showing two black men pointing guns at a white cop with the caption: 'Our real enemy.'

Marcell Salters has now apologized for posting the image and the caption, which continued: 'Need 2 stop pointing guns at each other & at the ones that's legally killing innocents.'

Police Union President John McNesby slammed the post as 'despicable' and defamatory, Fox29 reported.

The image, which shows two black men with guns raised at a white police officer's head, is from a rap video by Uncle Murda and Maino called 'Hands Up', which they wrote after the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, who were both died at the hands of officers over the summer.

'Despicable': Marcell Salters, a Philadelphia paramedic, shared this image to his Instagram page showing two black men holding guns to the head of a white police officer with the caption: 'Our real enemy'

On Thursday, Mayor Michael Nutter condemned Salters' decision to share the photo and caption, calling its message 'reprehensible'.

'We celebrate the exercise of our First Amendment right to expression,' he said. 'But there are clear limits, and this posting went far beyond standards of decency. Inflammatory speech or behavior like this is simply irresponsible and could potentially incite others to inappropriate actions.'

After the uproar, Salters, who works at medic 23 in southwest Philadelphia in the same building as 19th district police, posted an apology to his Facebook page.

'I would like to deeply apologize to anyone i have offended [sic],' he wrote. 'That post was out of anger of what is going on around the world (mike brown, eric garner & etc) & past experiences that i have had with the police.

'My intentions was not to slander or hurt anyone or my brothers in blue. Again i am sorry.'

Under investigation: An investigation into Salters' conduct is now being carried out, the mayor said  

Despite his apology, Salters made a comment on Facebook - that he later deleted - saying he 'never did or will like police', the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.  

'Because of what i do i have to work with them but dont have to like them,' he said. 'There are numerous crooked & corrupted cops (mostly white) & mostly they harass, beat, or kill innocents (mostly blks).'

Other friends also jumped to his defense on his page, saying he didn't need to apologize because he was talking 'from experience'. 

On the account, he can be seen in his medic's uniform and his URL for the page is 'Medic Salters'.

Nutter said he has asked Fire Commissioner Derrick Sawyer to conduct an investigation into the paramedic's conduct. He said any disciplinary actions would be brought following the investigation.

Apology: After the post caused uproar, Salters apologized and said he had shared it out of anger at police brutality across the country and out of experiences he had had with the police

Support: But many of Salters' friends said the fire department paramedic had no reason to apologize

'I'm asking that all of us be particularly mindful of our actions and expressions regarding matters of public safety and our first responders,' he said in his statement. 'We need to respect them all, and they must respect our citizens as well.' 

Joseph Schulle, head of the firefighters' union Local 22, told the Inquirer that he expected Salters would be disciplined because he made a comment about the post while on duty.

The initial Instagram post was made while he was off-duty, he said.

McNesby, of the police union, added: 'You don't want to see anybody lose their jobs especially around the holidays. But if the charge of stupidity was in their handbook he'd probably get a life sentence.'
