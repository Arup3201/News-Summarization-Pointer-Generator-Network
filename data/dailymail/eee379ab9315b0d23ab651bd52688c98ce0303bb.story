Â A 9-year-old boy was shot in the face on Friday morning during a drive by shooting past his Miami home.

Miami Police were called to the 800 
block of Northwest 55th Terrace at around 3:30 am after the shooting, 
reports the Miami Herald.

Family members identified the boy as Dontrell Darling. Four other children between the ages of 4 and 11 and three adults were in the home at the time of the shooting, reported NBC.

'Even though he had a serious injury in 
the face, he is considered stable,' Miami Fire Rescue spokesman Ignatius
Carroll said at the scene.

According to witness reports, a pale-colored SUV was spotted speeding away from the area after someone in the vehicle shot at the home.

Miami police said that the house was hit several times. 'I heard about 30 rapid gunshots, they went bop, bop, bop, bop, real rapid, about 30 of them, said a neighbor to reporters.

A car parked outside of the home was also badly damaged during the drive-by shooting

'It's a sad situation when a child can't be a child, when at 3:00 in the morning a kid can't sleep comfortably in his bed," said Miami Police spokesman Delrish Moss, reports the Huffington Post.

The victim's aunt, Shauntae, was present at the time and told NBC that the bullet went through two walls before hitting Dontrell Darling.

'The door was closed,' she said. 'It went through the door and through the wall and through the other side.'

Dontrell Darling remained calm as he was transported to a local hospital where he is currently being treated

Even though the 9-year-old Darling suffered serious injuries, he remained calm throughout the whole thing.

'I don't know if he was doing it to help his mom, but he's a pretty tough kid," Shauntae said. 'Looking at his face, everything it was split open, but he stayed calm,' said Shuantae.

The motive for the shooting is still unknown but police are looking for around four suspects seen driving past the scene.

Neighbor Albert Doyle told reporters that shootings happen in the neighborhood all the time.

'Sadly to say, weekly,' said Albert Doyle.
