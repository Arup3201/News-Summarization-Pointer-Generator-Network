The World Cup may be over but you haven’t seen the last of goalkeeper Tim Howard, the undisputed breakout star for the United States at the soccer tournament in Brazil.

Howard’s heroics as the U.S. made it through to the round of 16 earned him a legion of new fans and he’s currently advertising hot property as big brands fall over themselves in order to sign him up for endorsement deals.

The goalkeeper, who plays for English Premier League team Everton, has his tattooed torso and rugged good looks on display on the cover of the latest edition of Adweek.

Howard’s gutsy performances in the tournament, especially against Belgium on July 1 when he made a record 16 saves, earned him ringing endorsements from everyone from Tom Hanks to President Obama.

His twitter account @TimHowardGK gained nearly half a million new followers and with his popularity at all all-time high, he is set to cash in on his newfound celebrity and break into the endorsement big league.

‘People’s perception of me may have changed in the past two weeks, but I haven’t changed a bit,’ Howard told Adweek.

He already has six-figure deals with Nike and McDonald’s, although those are small fry compared to what someone like LeBron James makes in the world of big-time sponsorship deals.

Howard added that he’s seeking the same kinds of deals as always: ‘blue-chip opportunities [with] really good companies with good reputations.’

His agent Dan Segal of Wasserman Media Group, said he has received dozens of offers in the past two weeks, and that they're close to signing deals with at least three national advertisers.

‘We’re looking for things consistent with his image', which is down-to-earth and hardworking, rather than flashy or glitzy Segal says.

‘We don’t feel in any way, shape or form a desperation to try and grab everything that comes along.’

Howard's popularity during the World Cup led to a White House petition being lodged requesting that Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport be renamed after him.

His eye-catching display for the United States against Belgium sparked a string of photoshopped images of the goalkeeper saving the day in various iconic images from American history.

Howard's Wikipedia page was also edited to show the goalkeeper as the United States' Minister of Defence.

But now things have gone one step further thanks to the petition being lodged on the 'We the people' website.

The request reads: 'Tim Howard has shown himself to be a national treasure, Minister of Defense, Friend of Joe Biden, and the holder for the record of most saves in a World Cup match; Therefore, we politely request that we rename the airport to recognize his accomplishments, and meritorious service to the United States of America.

If a petition receives 100,000 signatures the White House administration will formally respond to the request.

However, Howard will have to call upon all of his new supporters if he is going to have an airport named in his honour. Less than 2,000 people have currently signed the petition, meaning he needs another 98,000 by July 31.
