Two of the Americans who were imprisoned in Iran after accidentally hiking over the border have told how they were able to have sex in prison after one of the guards left the keys in a cell door.

Shane Bauer managed to sneak out for a clandestine midnight romp with his then girlfriend Sarah Shourd when they were locked up in neighbouring cells.

Mercifully the pair, who are now married, were not caught but in the confusion of sneaking back to his own
 cell, Bauer mistakenly took Shourd's pants instead of his own.

The next day, Shourd saw her boyfriend in the prison yard and laughed out loud when she noticed his mistake.Â 

She told the Huffington Post: 'I didn't think it was possible, so when Shane asked me "If I could sneak into your cell would you allow me?" And I was like "of course".

'And when I realised it was real I got scared, I was like "they could separate us for ever".

'It
 was a dangerous thing to do but ultimately we couldn't resist. It was a
 horrible thing to be separated that way and we didn't know when we 
would see each other again.'

The couple and their companion Josh 
Fattal have written a book about the holiday they took to Kurdistan in 2009 that 
quickly turned into a nightmare when a guide led them astray.

The
 guide mistakenly led them into Iran, and the three college-friends were
 arrested. The two men spent more than two years in prison while Shourd 
spent most of her year behind bars in solitary confinement.

Ms Shourd became severely depressed during her imprisonment, but, in addition to the secret trysts, there were a few periods of unexpected joy such as the time Mr Bauer proposed to her using strings he pulled from a towel fastened with a staple.

In the prison yard one day, Bauer pulled her away from the surveillance cameras to pop the question.

'Baby, I didn't want to do this here,' he said. I wanted it to be somewhere beautiful, but...will you marry me?'

Following their release, Shourd and Bauer were married in May 2012. They also share another fond memory from their period of imprisonment.

Life got even worse when the trio were transferred to Evin, the Tehran prison notorious for holding political prisoners.

At one point, the two men were terrorized by a guard they nicknamed 'AK'.

AK initially threw Fattal, blindfolded, down a set of stairs before putting Bauer in a headlock and throwing him against the wall.

Shourd was released after a year while her friends were kept behind bars for an additional year. Above, a rally for the hikers outside the United Nations in July 2011

After a year behind bars, Shourd was released for a 'medical condition' and she joined the many on the outside championing for her friends' release.

At a dinner with Sean Penn and then-girlfriend Scartlett Johanssen, Shourd got the actor to promise to ask Hugo Chavez about her friends' wrongful imprisonment.

Chavez, the then-president of Venezuela was personal friends with Iran's then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

In the end, the hikers were convicted of illegal entry and espionage and sentenced to eight years in prison.

But Bauer and Fattal were released in September 2011 after Omani officials posted $500,000 bail.
