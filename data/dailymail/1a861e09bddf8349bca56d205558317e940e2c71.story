Two senior Secret Service agents who crashed their government car outside the White House actually disrupted an active bomb investigation, according to a shocking new report.

The agents, who are suspected of being drunk at the time, may have even driven over the suspicious package as they careened through police crime scene tape and smashed into a temporary barrier outside the President's home, the Washington Post reports.

About 10.30pm on March 4, a woman got out of her car at the south entrance of the White House and threw a package on the ground.

She told guards 'It's a bomb!' before speeding away in her car. 

The uniformed Secret Service officers cordoned off the area in crime scene tape and called the bomb squad. 

About 30 minutes later, Mark Connolly, the second-in-command for President Barack Obama’s security detail, and George Ogilvie, a senior supervisor at the agency's field office in Washington, smashed through the crime scene.

It's not clear which agent was driving. 

Their government car broke the crime scene tape and crashed into barrels that made a temporary barrier, according to a Secret Service police report.  

According to the Post, the two men were returning from a Secret Service party in the nearby Chinatown neighborhood. 

Investigators told the newspaper that the two men either drive very close to or smashed over top of the suspicious package. 

Police reports reveal that officers suspected the two men were drunk and wanted to arrest them and give them breath tests.

The Secret Service, which has been plagued by scandals in recent years, is working to clean up its image - through the latest incident surely won't help 

However, a supervisor told them to let the men go on their way and return home. 

About 45 minutes later, explosives experts arrived and determined that the package did not pose a threat. 

Officers recorded the license plate number of the woman who dropped the package and later questioned her about the threat.  

The incident is just the latest embarrassment for the Secret Service, which has been plagued by a slew of security lapses and misconduct by agents in recent years. 

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in October following the revelation that a man with a knife had made it all the way into the White House after jumping the fence - along with several other incidents that came to light. 

Pierson herself was brought in to clean up the agency after the resignation of her predecessor Mark Sullivan, who was forced out when it was revealed that 11 agents had hired prostitutes and threw wild parties in Cartagena, Colombia, in April 2012 ahead of Obama's visit there. 

Obama learned about the incident earlier in the week, before word broke publicly through the news media.On Thursday, the White House said the President still has full confidence in his newest Secret Service Director, Joseph Clancy - despite the newest debacle. 

White House spokesman Eric Schultz says Obama was disappointed to learn about the incident. But he says nobody has higher standards for the Secret Service than Clancy.

Schultz says Clancy will continue making reforms to address the problems in the agency.
