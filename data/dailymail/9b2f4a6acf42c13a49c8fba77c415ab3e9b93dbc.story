Since the 1800s, populations around the world have grown six fold causing a rapid expansion of cities and towns.

To plot the extent at which some of these cities have grown, cartographers created colourful and striking maps showing the age of every building in certain countries.

Properties in Moscow, Reykjavik, New York City and its borough Brooklyn have been colour coded to not only show how populations have expanded, but also highlight the places within those cities that are still growing.  

The colours in the Houses of Moscow map, pictured, appear to spread outwards from the centre of the Russian city in ripples. The oldest buildings are plotted around this centre and date back to the 15th Century and much of the architecture that was built before the revolution remains largely untouched

The colours in the Houses of Moscow map, for example, appear to spread outwards from the centre of the Russian city in ripples, resembling how bacteria multiplies in a petri dish.

The oldest buildings are plotted around the centre, dating all the way back to the 15th Century and much of the architecture that was built before the revolution remains largely untouched.

As the map is zoomed out, the newer developments sit predominantly on the outskirts of the city.

Houses of Moscow, created by Russia’s Mercator Research Centre, lists six historical periods.The map covers pre-revolutionary Russia, and then Russia under Stalin and the Bolsheviks (1922 to 1952), Nikita Khrushchev (1958 to 1964), Leonid Brezhnev (1964 to 1982), Yuri Andropov (1982 to 1984), Konstantin Chernenko (1984 to 1985), Mikhail Gorbachev (1988 to 1991) and Yury Luzhkov (1992 to 2010). 

The Age of Greater Reykjavik map, pictured, shows the age of the building in Iceland’s capital city. It was created by cartographer Matt Riggott. The dark brown buildings dates back to before 1900, while the whiter buildings were built from 1995 onwards

The Age of Greater Reykjavik map shows the age of the buildings in Iceland’s capital city.

This map, created by cartographer Matt Riggott, isn’t as colourful as the Houses of Moscow one; instead the darker the brown colour of the buildings, the older they are.

Dark brown buildings date back to before 1900, while the whiter buildings were built from 1995 onwards.

Riggott’s map has a sci-fi feel to its colour scheme, caused in part by the city’s layout, and the map has similarities with main viewer screen from the Star Trek series.

Users can hover their mouse over any of the buildings on any of these maps to view their precise addresses and age.

In New York there are two maps that plot the age of its buildings. The New York City map, including the five boroughs of Brooklyn, Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Staten Island, was designed and created by website Bdon.

The New York City map, pictured, including the five boroughs of Brooklyn, Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Staten Island, was designed and created by website Bdon. There are a total of 1,053,713 buildings on a colour range of pink to yellow, dating from 1830 to 1995 onwards

Unlike Moscow and Rekjyavik, New York is a much newer city in terms of architecture. Few buildings remain that date back to the 19th century but one of the oldest properties is shown as 67 Jumel Terrace, built in 1765.

This is the Morris-Jumel Mansion located in the historic district in Washington Heights.

The district consists of 49 rowhouses and apartment buildings built between 1882 and 1909. Many of the buildings are made of wood or brick rowhouses in the Queen Anne and Romanesque styles. 

Other older buildings can also be found in Broadway as well as along the East river in Manhattan.

Alternatively, people interested in seeing the ages of buildings in just Brooklyn can use the Block by Block map. This map covers buildings built in 1825, shown in blue, up to buildings built since 2000, shown in dark red.

Properties in Brooklyn appear to be more evenly spread in terms of age, but the predominant colour is yellow, and this indicates houses built at the start of the 20th century.

The newest developments are found in the north and east of the borough including Gateway Drive and its shopping mall, dating back to 2001, and 5502 Avenue U built in 2010.

Both the New York City and Brooklyn maps were built using NYC’s Pluto data from Department of City Planning.
