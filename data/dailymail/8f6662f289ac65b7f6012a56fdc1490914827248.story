Spain will not defend their European Under 21 Championship title in the Czech Republic next summer after they were beaten in the qualification play-offs by Serbia.

The Spaniards had won the tournament in 2011 and 2013 but, after a goalless draw in the first-leg in Serbia, they lost 2-1 in Cadiz on Tuesday night and will miss out on the showpiece next summer.

A Jose Gaya own-goal had given Serbia a vital away goal in the first-half before Sergi Roberto and Filip Kostic traded goals in stoppage-time.

The Spaniards were able to boast Real Madrid star Isco and Barcelona' Munir El Haddadi in midfield, but he could not inspire his young team-mates to match the heroics of 2011 and 2013.

The defeat brings to an end their 35-match unbeaten streak and relinquished their hold on the trophy. 

Spain coach Albert Celades said: 'We did everything we could, but in football the best team doesn't always win. They had two shots on target and scored two goals. We played well, we had a lot of the ball, we gave everything but it was all for nothing.

'This is a terrible blow for everyone; the team does not deserve this punishment. We tried to win the game right until the final second, but it was no use. We are left with a terrible feeling and everyone in the dressing room is destroyed, because these boys gave everything but it was impossible.'
