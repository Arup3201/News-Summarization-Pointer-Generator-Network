Garry Monk has told Swansea supporters to trust the club’s board after talks commenced with foreign investors.

Swansea City Supporters Trust are wary of external investment in a club that, in recent years, has been heralded for its ownership model and local backing.

But chairman Huw Jenkins said last month the club were ‘miles behind’ their rivals in commercial income and needed to consider alternative revenues in order to compete.

It is understood they are now in talks with American millionaire John Jay Moores, as well as his long-time associate Charles Noell. 

Moores, 70, previously owned the San Diego Padres Major League Baseball franchise in California and a Swansea source told Sportsmail that the Texan is discussing the possibility of purchasing an equity stake in the club, though no offers have yet been made.

The club have refused to confirm or deny Moores is in talks.

Swansea’s current board has taken the club from League Two to the Premier League and Monk said on Thursday: ‘It's important as a club that we look to push forward.

‘The way to do that is maybe attract other interest and other investment and there are areas of the club that need to be strengthened - facility-wise, commercially, infrastructure and expansion of the stadium.

‘What I would say is over the last 10-11 years you speak to everyone who's been involved at this club and Huw and the board have always made the decisions with the best interests of the club in mind.

‘It's not about someone coming in and taking over everything - people should have trust in the board that they will do whatever's best for the good of Swansea.’

He added: ‘The bigger clubs are going to stretch away with more money and the clubs that are left behind must try to stay on their heels enough to compete.

‘This is a way of doing it and that's what the club is looking at. Of course I can understand the fans' concerns but Huw and the board are very shrewd in what they do.’
