A British holidaymaker has received nearly £3,000 in compensation from Thomas Cook after he contracted E. coli while staying at a Tunisian resort.

Carl Pallant, from Horsham, West Sussex, became so sick that he had to be admitted to hospital for several days following his visit to the Vincci Taj Sultan hotel in June 2013.

The 29-year-old and his girlfriend booked the getaway through Thomas Cook and he reported that breakdowns in hygiene standards were rife within the resort’s restaurants.

Mr Pallant said in a statement that food was often served undercooked and birds were flying around the open buffet restaurants where food was uncovered.

He said: ‘The conditions in the restaurant were really poor … I noticed bird faeces on tablecloths and birds landing on tables and chairs.’

His symptoms, including diarrhoea and stomach cramps, surfaced about two weeks after he returned to the UK, which is a normal timeframe for E. coli.

He told the West Sussex County Times: ‘I went back to work for a week. It takes about two weeks for it to take effect.

‘By the second week I was really ill. It was awful, it was really awful. I have never been so ill in my life.’

When he was admitted to hospital, doctors weren’t sure what was wrong with him and they administered various tests over four days.

They eventually determined that he had contracted E. coli on his holiday in the tourist resort of Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia.

An E. coli infection can be caused by food that has been undercooked or washed in water which may have been contaminated by human or animal faeces.

Thomas Cook agreed to pay £2,935 in compensation to Mr Pallant, who filed a claim against the tour operator with Your Holiday Claims.

In a statement, Thomas Cook said it is sorry that he fell ill while on holiday and it has extended an apology.

The tour operator said: ‘We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, as Thomas Cook closely audits all the properties to which it operates to ensure that only the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.

‘We would kindly ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.’
