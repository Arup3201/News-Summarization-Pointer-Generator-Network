Locked up: Family doctor Davinder Jeet Bains has been jailed for filming intimate examinations of his patients on a hidden spy camera

A family doctor who used a secret 
camera inside his James Bond-style wristwatch to record himself abusing 
female patients was jailed for 12 years today.

Dr Davinder Jeet Bains, 46, used his 
position as a GP at a medical practice in Royal Wootton Bassett, near 
Swindon, Wiltshire, to assault dozens of his female patients.

Bains filmed the attacks on his Tieex 4GB Waterproof Spy Watch, which has been likened to something out of a 007 film.

It has a built-in camera on the face -
with simple on and off buttons to record - and can be bought on the 
internet for less than £60.

When detectives arrested Bains at the
Tinkers Lane Surgery they discovered his 
hi-tech wristwatch and later recovered 361 high-quality video clips from the watch and home computer.

At Swindon Crown Court today, Bains was jailed for 12 years after he admitted dozens of charges against him for attacks against 27 women.

Around 3,000 potential victims were 
contacted by police officers but the exact number is thought to be 
'close to 300' – aged between 14 and 51.

Passing sentence, Judge Field told Bains he had breached the trust patients put in their doctor.

'When you committed these offences you breached this duty of trust in the most grievous way,' he said.

'You are a disgrace to the medical profession.'

The police investigation began in 
June last year when a 19-year-old woman told officers she thought Bains 
filmed her as she showered and said she had been sexually assaulted by 
him in Swindon.

After arresting Bains and discovering the watch, detectives found it had a tiny lens in the place of the 
number six.

Some of the graphic clips are up to 45 minutes long and had 
at some point been downloaded onto his laptop.

Investigating
officers were left staggered that Bains managed to get away with his sexual 
abuse for so long.

Until police were tipped off 
about his secret filming by a female lodger at his home, nobody 
complained about him.

Those he targeted overlooked moments of 
strangeness for fear of upsetting the delicate doctor-patient 
relationship.

During the sentencing today, Judge Field told Bains that, regarding one of the victims in particular - a teenage girl - he was in a 'high position of trust' when he covertly filmed her.

Many victims of the doctor thought his behaviour was strange but feared upsetting the delicate doctor-patient 
relationship.

One 21-year-old victim told the Daily Mail of her horrific experience.

She went to see Bains in May last year
after experiencing vaginal bleeding following sex with her partner.

She
was offered an appointment with Bains. The surgery had no female 
doctors and, because of the intimate nature of the problem, she decided 
to take her mother with her.

‘He asked me why I was there and I 
explained briefly. He started asking very strange questions. My mum and I
were looking at each other, a bit taken aback.’

Bains told Kate - not her real name - that he would need to 
examine her. ‘I had expected that,’ she said, ‘so I’d prepared myself. 
He asked if I wanted my mum to leave, and I said yes.’

Bains disappeared for a couple of minutes, telling Kate not to get undressed until he returned.

She
says: ‘I assumed it was normal procedure before a patient undressed — 
that maybe he was closing blinds somewhere, or locking a connecting door
in case someone came in.’

When he came back, locking the door 
behind him, Bains told Kate to undress. He did not pull the examination 
bed curtain around her, close the blinds or offer her any privacy.

‘He
watched me getting undressed,’ says Kate. ‘He was very quiet. I felt 
very uncomfortable. I was trying to pull my top down so he wouldn’t see.
But I didn’t know what was normal.

‘He
put some gloves on and asked me to get up onto the bed. He said he was 
going to do a visual examination and that if there was anything he 
didn’t like the look of, he’d take a sample.’

For
the next 20 minutes, Bains ‘examined’ Kate, filming himself all the 
time. ‘It was a long, long time,’ she says. ‘but I just thought he was 
being thorough.’

Her mother assumed that they were talking and had not realised how long he had been intimately examining her daughter.

Kate
remembers that he was shaking and seemed very nervous. At the end of 
the consultation, Bains gave Kate the all-clear and told her to get 
dressed.

Her mother said: 
‘When she came out of the room, I commented on how long it had taken and
she said she’d never felt so degraded in her life. I remember saying 
“Welcome to our world”, because all women have to endure that kind of 
thing at some point. I feel so stupid now.’

'In serious breach of that trust you 
engaged in entirely inappropriate sexualised behaviour with her, 
including plying her with alcohol and showing her a sexually explicit 
film,' the judge said.

'You then sexually abused her. 
Fortunately she reported her concerns to a friend and thus supported, 
she reported matters to the police.

'Once the police had commenced their 
investigations they discovered your computer and found these videos 
which showed you had been conducting intimate examinations of a large 
number of female patients from July 2009 to June 2012 and had covertly 
videoed them while doing so.

'You of all people will be aware that
the relationship between a doctor and his patient is of fundamental 
importance in the practice of medicine.

'In this relationship the doctor is 
placed in a very high position of trust and the patient is entitled to 
expect the doctor to discharge that duty with the highest standard.

'This is particularly so when a female patient consults a male doctor on intimate matters.'

Bains, from Swindon, committed offences against 27 women - aged from 14 to 51 - between July 2010 and May 2012.

He admitted a total of 39 charges:
13 of assault by penetration, 13 of voyeurism, 11 of sexual assault and
two of sexual activity with a child.

He also asked for a further 65 
offences - 10 of sexual assault by penetration, eight of sexual assault 
and 47 of voyeurism - to be taken into account when Judge Douglas Field 
passed sentence.

His not guilty pleas to three charges
of sexual assault and a single count of administering a noxious drug 
with intent to commit a sexual offence were accepted by the Crown and 
will lie on file.

Bains left Malaysia at the age of 21 to study medicine at university in India, which is where his Sikh family was originally from, and graduated from Kasturba Medical College, an affiliate of Mangalore University.

He is still registered with the Indian equivalent of the UK’s General Medical Council, the Medical Council of India, which oversees doctors.

According to the MCI’s Code of Medical Ethics, ‘A physician should be an upright man. He shall keep himself pure in character and be diligent in caring for the sick; he should be modest, sober, patient.’

As well as working as a locum GP, Bains worked in three different surgeries in Wiltshire after completing his three-year training as a GP registrar in February 2007.

He worked at New Court surgery in Wootton Bassett between 2007 and 2008, at Rowden Surgery in Chippenham in 2008, and moved to Tinkers Lane in June 2008.

Police swooped on Bains at Tinkers Lane Surgery in June last year, bursting into his consulting room so that he had no time to get rid of the camera watch he was wearing.
