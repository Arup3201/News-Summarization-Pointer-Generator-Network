Former Manchester United manager David Moyes has revealed that Adnan Januzaj reminds him of Dutch legend Johan Cruyff.

Despite the Scotsman's ill-fated tenure at Old Trafford, Moyes is credited with introducing the 19-year-old to the first team last season - when he made 35 appearances in all competitions and scored four goals before travelling to the 2014 World Cup with Belgium.

Now manager of Real Sociedad, Moyes has been praising the youngster's talent and attitude since first beind impressed by him on United's 2013 pre-season tour.

Speaking to FourFourTwo magazine, Moyes said: 'Some youngsters get overawed. Not Adnan. I realised that when he came to train with the first team soon after I joined.

'I decided to take him on tour with the first team within minutes of watching him. He wasn't timid but hungry to succeed. He was one of the tour's bright spots.

'He possesses a level of self-assured arrogance, which is a positive as he's not too arrogant. On the contrary, he's a bright lad who is mature for his age.

'He's a wonderfully gifted player with great balance and the ability to go past people. When I see his poise on the ball, he has characteristics of Johan Cruyff.'

By contrast, Januzaj  has started only four Premier League games under Louis van Gaal this season - leading to speculation that he could be tempted to find first team football elsewhere, with Paris Saint Germain the latest club expressing an interest in taking the starlet on loan.

The French champions had a bid rejected for the young Belgium international last year and are keen to see if he will join on a temporary deal.

Januzaj, who is also eligible to play in European competition, has interest from English clubs such as Everton and Hull while Inter Milan are also reportedly keen.
