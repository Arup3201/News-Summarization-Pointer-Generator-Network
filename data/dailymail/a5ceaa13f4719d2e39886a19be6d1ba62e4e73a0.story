Paul Pogba will not be leaving Juventus in the January transfer window despite the French midfielder being linked with several of Europe's elite clubs, according to agent Mino Raiola.

The 21-year-old is reportedly wanted by the likes of Chelsea, Real Madrid and former club Manchester United but looks set to remain in Turin until at least the end of the season having only recently signed a five-year deal with the Serie A champions.

Speaking top Sky Sports, Raiola said: 'He will stay here this window in Italy and after that it's also up to Juventus and up to himself to see what are the possibilities and what are the things to do.

Are these the eight clubs that could afford to land Pogba?

Real Madrid £459.5m (2013-14 revenue)

Manchester United £433.2m

Bayern Munich £407.7m

FC Barcelona £405.2m

Paris Saint-Germain £396.5m

Manchester City £346.5m

Chelsea £324.4m

Arsenal £300.5m 

'I have been in football long enough to say that I cannot foresee the future. Today Paul Pogba is the most expensive player if he would be on the market – that's the risk, that's normal; there are only a few clubs that can afford him.

'Let's say that I am aware of the interest that there is around Paul, obviously, and without naming them, everybody that knows a little bit about football knows that there are only eight clubs that can afford him. 

'That's the eight clubs that will get into the scramble or the battle to have him.'

Despite leaving Old Trafford as a 19-year-old after failing to establish himself under Sir Alex Ferguson, Raiola has not ruled out a return for Pogba to Manchester United.

He said: 'Paul has always said he is not angry with Manchester United – you need to move on. 

'So there is no personal grudge against Manchester United. On the contrary, he holds Manchester United very dear and has very nice memories.'
