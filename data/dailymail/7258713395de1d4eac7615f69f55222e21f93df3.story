As the devastated Oklahoma City suburb of Moore begins to rebuild after Monday's epic storm, federal forecasters warned that as many as six more could be heading our way in the coming months, in the form of hurricanes.

The National Weather Service gave an official warning on Thursday, predicting 13 to 20 named Atlantic storms this coming hurricane season, 7 to 11 that strengthen into hurricanes and 3 to 6 that become major hurricanes.

Hurricanes and tornadoes are both wind storms, though the former tend to form over water while tornadoes or twisters generally form over land.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said there is a 70 per cent chance that this year will be more active than an average hurricane season - potentially bringing with it another Superstorm Sandy.

'This is your warning,' acting NOAA administrator Kathryn Sullivan said on Thursday to those living in hurricane prone areas along the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico coasts.

A normal year has 12 named storms, six hurricanes and three major storms with winds over 110 mph.

Last year was the third-busiest on record with 19 named storms. Ten became hurricanes and were two major storms.

That included Sandy, which caused $50 billion in damage even though it lost hurricane status when it made landfall in New Jersey.

All the factors that go into hurricane forecasts are pointing to an active season, or extremely active one, said lead forecaster Gerry Bell of the Climate Prediction Center.

Those factors include warmer than average ocean waters that provide fuel for storms, a multi-decade pattern of increased hurricane activity, the lack of an El Nino warming of the central Pacific Ocean, and an active pattern of storm systems coming off west Africa.

The forecasts don't include where storms might land, if any place.

The six-month season starts June 1. Forecasters name tropical storms when their top winds reach 39 mph; hurricanes have maximum winds of at least 74 mph.
