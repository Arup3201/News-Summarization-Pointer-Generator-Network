For larger pets, scaled down versions are made due to postage and storage logistics. Lengths of these plush toys generally vary between 17 and 19 inches.

Cuddle Clones' factory is currently located in China. 

Talia Howard , 34, from Michigan said she decided to get a plush toy duplicate of her pug Bongo after learning he had a canine form of multiple sclerosis.

She thought it would serve as a physical reminder of him for years to come.

'It is heartbreaking, but I know he will be at peace,' Howard told CNN of Bongo's impending death adding: 'And, I have this fantastic Cuddle Clone to remember him by.'

For pet owners with less cash to splash, Cuddle Clones also makes four inch sandstone figurines, which cost $99.

The concept was the brainchild of Jennifer Graham, who started it as a college class project in 2011. She went on to launch her business in 2013.

Cuddle Clones has apparently seen a spike in sales over recent months thanks to customers sharing images of their clones on social media.

Most of the requests that come in are for dogs. There have also been inquiries around lizards but no one has ordered one yet.

People thinking about ordering the clones for a special occasion should think ahead, as the creation process can take up to five months. 

A portion from each sale goes to pet-related causes.
