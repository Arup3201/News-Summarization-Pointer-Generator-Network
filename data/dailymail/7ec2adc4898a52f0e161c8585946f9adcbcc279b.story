Winners: ISIS officially admitted being defeated in Kobane on Saturday, but have threatened retaliation 

Speaking on behalf of ISIS, two militants said the airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition were the main reason why they had been forced to withdraw from Kobane.

The admissions were made in a a video released by the pro-ISIS Aamaq News Agency late Friday, in which the fighters  vowed to retaliate against the Kurdish militia.

On Monday, activists and Kurdish officials said the town was almost cleared of IS fighters, who once held nearly half of Kobane. 

The failure to capture Kobane was a major blow to ISIS, whose hopes for an easy victory turned into a costly siege under airstrikes by coalition forces and an assault by Kurdish Peshmerga,

The United States and its allies have carried out 27 air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria since Friday, the Combined Joint Task Force leading the operation reported on Saturday.

Some 13 air strikes targeted areas near Kobane in just 24 hours, it was reported on Wednesday. 

The strikes around Kobane hit 12 Islamic State tactical
units and a vehicle, and destroyed nine fighting positions, a
staging area and three buildings, the Combined Joint Task Force
said in a statement.

The Pentagon said at the time that the militants had been driven
out of 90 percent of Kobane, a city near the border with Turkey
where fighting has raged for four months.

Six air strikes in northern Iraq, where Islamic State
has seized swathes of territory, targeted al Asad, Kirkuk, Mosul
and Sinjar, hitting tactical units, a checkpoint, six buildings
and six shipping containers, the task force said. 

Final blow: Airstrikes by the US-led coalition were the main reason why extremists were forced to withdraw from the town, according to two of the group's fighters

Big hit: Some 13 air strikes targeted areas near Kobane in just 24 hours last week, it has been reported

Remains of the day: The failure to capture Kobane was a major blow to the extremists, whose hopes for an easy victory turned into a costly siege under airstrikes by coalition forces and an assault by Kurds
