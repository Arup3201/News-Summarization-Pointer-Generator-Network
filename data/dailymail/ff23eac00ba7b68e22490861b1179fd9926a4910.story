Pearly queen: The Pearl of Asia - the largest pearl in the world, once part of the crown jewels of the Moghul empire - is on display at the V&A

A parasitic invertebrate that has just been pooed out by a shark is hardly the place you'd go to find that classy necklace.

But experts have scuppered the popular belief that pearls form through friction with a grain of sand - saying that they actually build around tapeworm larvae.

The revelation, which might have surprised fans of the beads such as Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, comes as part of a new exhibition at the V&A in London.

A video demonstrating how the precious stones form when tapeworm larvae excreted by sharks and stingrays become trapped in water-filtering shellfish such as oysters will be on show at the museum's Pearls exhibition, which begins on Saturday.

The show's co-creator, Hubert Bari, said:
 'The people marketing (pearls) prefer to say, "It is so fantastic, your
 necklace was made from a grain of sand".

'It is better to speak about a grain of sand than to speak about a piece of s*** from a stingray.'

The somewhat unsavoury origins of the 
pearl have been known since 1852, when Filippi of Turin proved that a 
parasitic flatworm called the Distomum duplicatum was the cause of the 
stones forming inside freshwater mussels.

...and here's the little guy who made it: The larvae of a tapeworm, which gets into shellfish and causes them to excrete a substance that forms into a pearl

The tapeworm had its crucial role in pearl formation acknowledged in a 1903 paper by Professors Herdman and Hornell on pearl fisheries in Ceylon.

Pearls can form around any parasite - 
including fish and snails - that has drilled into the the flesh of sea 
creatures such as mussels, but tapeworms and flatworms that have been 
excreted by larger animals are the most common invaders.

The
 immune system of the shellfish then fights the worm by surrounding them
 with layer upon layer of nacre - a calcium-based material that makes up
 their shells - causing the parasite to suffocate and become trapped in 
this solid casing.

Oysters, which produce a milky nacre, are the most common source for commercial pearls, but other animals can produce pearls that are black, blue, red or green, depending on the natural colour of their nacre.

Pearls are most abundant where ecosystems thrive from larger predators through to the parasites and their hosts.

The V&A exhibition explores the history of pearls, chronicling how the jewels went from being a luxury
 adored by royalty (Queen Victoria loved pearls so much she had 
Garrard’s create black pearl jewellery when she was in mourning) to 
objets d’art, by jewellers such as Vietnamese Sam Tho Duong, and a 
mass-produced product worn by fashionistas and aristos alike.

Natural: The exhibition opens on Saturday and includes historical displays and features about the science of pearls

It goes back to the invention of the cultured pearl and how Kokichi Mikimoto produced it on an industrial scale in Japan.

Marilyn Monroe wore a 16in string of Mikimoto pearls to court the day she divorced her second husband Joe DiMaggio in 1954.

After the war, the Hollywood hits of the 1940s and the 1950s generated a feelgood factor and a style that was desired – if not affordable for ordinary Americans. 

Doris Day, Lauren Bacall and Ava Gardner were among the actresses who wore pearl chokers made up of cultured pearls – they gradually started to take over from natural pearls.

For centuries, pearls had been a sign of extreme wealth. 

Finding
 one usually required a diver to open 2,000 oysters, – but Mikimoto, who
 headed the company which made Monroe’s necklace, pioneered the 
commercial ‘culturing’ of pearls, where irritants were deliberately 
introduced to oysters to farm jewellery. 

Mikimoto said he wanted to ‘adorn the necks of all women around the world with pearls’.

History went full circle when Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, wore a £48 pair of drop-pearl earrings by Belinda Hadden, to the celebration of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012.

The exhibition also features Liz 
Taylor’s stunning Bulgari pendant earrings, a pearl-drop earring worn by
 Charles I at his execution in 1649, a brooch given as a sentimental 
gift to Queen Victoria by Prince Albert and a sparkling collection of 
tiaras, including one with pearls ‘the size of walnuts’ made for the 
wedding of Hannah de Rothschild who in the 1870s was the wealthiest 
woman in England.

Much of the show focuses on rare, natural pearls from the Arabian Gulf.

Coco Chanel changed the fashion by happily wearing genuine and fake pearls at the same time, and ambassadors since have included Jackie Kennedy (pictured with son John Jr) and Princess Diana

Elizabeth Taylor's Bulgari pendant earrings: 'To find a pair of drop pearls of such quality and size is astonishing. She wore them in the film Ash Wednesday,' said co-curator Beatriz Chadour-Sampson

‘Qatar and the other Gulf states have  money and they want to buy their heritage back,’ says Chadour-Sampson.

‘They now own Elizabeth Taylor’s pendant earrings and many other pieces including an eye-popping 1930s Cartier five-strand graduated pearl necklace. 

'If you think that you need thousands of oysters to find a pearl it’s no surprise they have been seen as objects of desire through the ages.’

The Romans wore pearls as items of sheer luxury, while in medieval times they became a Christian symbol for purity and chastity, and then in the Renaissance symbols of  authority and wealth.

They were even felt to have medicinal 
properties – philosopher and statesman Francis Bacon is said to have 
taken crushed pearls mixed with lemon juice as an elixir.

‘Pearls are still given at weddings today and  have an association with joy,’ says Chadour-Sampson. 

‘But
 at the same time they are directly associated with death. The classical
 belief that pearls were created from the teardrops of the gods links 
them with sadness and tears.’

Their cachet has continued into the age of Hollywood and celebrity, helped by the rise of cultivated and imitation pearls. 

Coco Chanel changed the fashion by happily wearing genuine and fake pearls at the same time, and ambassadors since have included Jackie Kennedy and Princess Diana.

‘What fascinated me is the variety of pearls, the international trade and the worldwide obsession,’ says Chadour-Sampson.  

‘Rubies and emeralds have been fashionable at certain times, and even diamonds go in and out of favour, but the appeal of pearls appears to  have been continuous through all jewellery history.’

‘A five-string graduated natural Gulf pearl necklace made by Cartier in the 1930s. He sourced his pearls directly in the Gulf that were then mounted in Paris. This really embodies the endurance of the divers and the rarity of the pearls.’ 

‘Worn by Charles I when he was beheaded in 1649. It’s very difficult to authenticate these things, but in this case the family has a note saying what this pearl is and it’s written in the hand of Queen Mary II, his granddaughter.’ 

‘George III, who was normally known for his restraint, dressed to dazzle with jewels at festive events and is recorded as having a special interest in buttons and button-making.’ 

‘A wedding present when Hannah de Rothschild, the richest woman in England, married a wealthy young politician, Archibald, 5th earl of Rosebery. She died 12 years later and Rosebery then presented it to his daughter-in-law. The New York Times described the pearls in the tiara as being as big as walnuts.’ 

‘Necklace given to Monroe by Joe DiMaggio on their honeymoon. It was bought in Japan directly from Mikimoto, so the quality is very good.’ 

‘A heart-shaped openwork gold brooch given to Victoria by Prince Albert in 1843 on their third wedding anniversary. It’s surmounted by a crown with four Scottish freshwater pearls from the River Tay.’ 

‘Liz Taylor was crazy about jewellery, and even wrote a book, My Love Affair with Jewellery. To find a pair of drop pearls of such quality and size is astonishing. She wore them in the film Ash Wednesday.’ 

‘The Abernethy pearl is the largest Scottish river pearl ever found – it was found in the 1960s. River pearls tend to be smaller than saltwater pearls.’
