From a water buffalo enjoying the cool waters of an African lake, to the tiniest dragon fly hitching a ride, it really was a case of all creatures great and small when it came to picking the finalists of the Society of International Nature and Wildlife Photographers Nature's Secrets competition.

Faced with hundreds of entries showcasing the very best mother nature has to offer, judges picked French photographer Michel Hagege's stunning shot of a baby monkey clinging to its mother in a Japanese hot spring as the winner of the 2014 contest.

'It was taken at Jigokudani, close to Nagano in Japan. It was snowing, windy and cold, about minus 5 and the monkeys were relaxing in the hot spring,' the 55-year-old said.

Csaba Toth from Hungary came in second with a duck in the morning mist on the Danube, while South African Bridgena Barnard, 48, took third place with her picture of a happy-looking gecko in the Namib desert.

And British photographers were well represented among the finalists as 73-year-old Peter Oak, a retired builder, and wedding photographer Julian Clune were highly commended for their photographs of a peregrine falcon with its prey, and a red squirrel.

Winner: French photographer Michel Hagege, 55, won the top prize of the Society of International Nature and Wildlife Photographers Nature's Secrets competition with this shot of a baby monkey clinging to its mum in a hot spring in Japan as the snow fell

Second place: Csaba Toth, from Hungary, came in second with this photograph of two ducks in the morning mists of the Danube

All smiles: South African photographer Bridgena Barnard, 48, took third place with her picture of a happy-looking gecko in the Namib desert, which stretches through Angola, Namibia and South Africa

Best of British: Retired builder Peter Oak, 73, was highly commended for this photograph of a  Peregrine falcon with its prey, taken just after the kill

Red alert: Mr Oak was also highly commended for this picture of a red squirrel, which he took in Scotland

'Nature at its best': This dramatic picture of a sealion chasing a penguin in Antarctica was taken by Giacomo Cattaneo, 26, a research assistant from Zurich, Switzerland. 'It was a crude but fascinating display of nature at its best,' he said. 'Everybody could not help but feel sorry for the penguin, as the seal kind of played with it as a cat would do with a mouse, throwing it around and catching it mid-air'

Highly commended: Another red squirrel, captured on camera at the Loch Garten RSPB by wedding photographer Julian Clune, 25,  from Hull, also featured among the finalists. 'I saw this little fellow run across the floor and up a tree right in front of me,' he said. 'I thought I actually scared him away, but just as I started to put my camera down I saw him pop his little head around the corner of the tree in the most charming way'

Spotted: Mr Clune also had his photograph of a group of ladybirds on a bench highly commended. He said: 'I popped out into my back garden one day and saw all these ladybirds grouped together on a piece of my wooden garden furniture. It was a bizarre collection of ladybirds that I've never seen in that mass in any one location at any one time, so I quickly went back inside to grab my camera and capture the lot'

Back garden bliss: A hoverfly on a helichrysum flower in her back garden in Hounslow, west London, got Anne Algar a highly commended

Hitching a ride: Ms Algar was also rewarded for her photograph of two dragonflies, which she took at the RSPB Farnham nature reserve

Tax adviser Liz Fiddy, from Ingham Corner in Norfolk was highly commended for her shot of a snipe at the RSPB Reserve at Titchwell, Norfolk. She said: 'I saw the snipe preening in one of the lagoons, not too far from the pathway. I watched and waited until it stretched its wings and I got a series of shots'

Hot spot: This shot of a barn owl was taken by Margaret Holland, 74 when she spotted it from her car and jumped out to get the picture in Norfolk. Ms Holland, from Ipswich said: 'It was a point and shoot effort'

Taking a dip: Moving further afield, winner Mr Hagege was also highly commended for a shot of a buffalo. He said: 'The water buffalo and flamingoes picture was taken in Lake Nakuru, Kenya and I tried to get close to the buffalo to capture the pastel colours'

Three little birds: Julia Daykin spotted these greenfinches perched in an apple tree in her Lincolnshire back garden. 'We encourage all wildlife to visit and during the bird breeding season we get lots of juvenile birds dropping in,' she said. 'This year we have had Starlings, Blackbirds, Blue Tits, Great Tits, Robins, Chiff Chaffs, Wrens, Dunnocks, Greenfinches, Goldfinches, Chaffinches and Woodpeckers (Greater Spotted Woods), juvenile Sparrowhawk and Yellowhammer'

Carrying cargo: Jitu Jam, 31, photographed this coot in Gujarat, India, as it built a nest on Lakhota lake. He said: 'It was busy making a nest with leaves and broken branches. I was surprised it was collecting branches as big as itself'

Nature's bounty: Mr Jam also received a highly commended for his photograph of wild flowers, which he took one morning in Gujarat

Snow business: Canadian Jaliya Rasaputra, 58, from Ottawa got a picture of a snowy owl looking for prey in a field. Jaliya said: 'The bird was perched on a snow mound looking around for a good lookout point for mice or voles. I kept a safe distance to keep the bird in its comfort zone'

Spinning a web: Another highly commended snap of an orb weaver spider was taken by English/Dutch photographer Natascha Mehrabi as she carried out plant surveys in a village called Malambwe in the Democratic Republic of Congo

All a flutter: Sri Lankan lawyer Ajithaa Edirimane took a picture of a butterfly which resembles a dried leaf found resting on her garden table

Up all night: Chinese photographer Zhong Ming, 50, stayed up all night to get this shot of a cicada, pressing the shutter at 3am on Heming Mountain, Sichuan province. He said: 'Insect photography is tough and a night shot is even tougher. It's not unusual that you get nothing after hours ordays of searching and waiting'. He added:  'Under the micro photographic lens, it was like a gymnast, full of strength and grace. Nobody would hesitate to press the shutter. Observing its wings, you would come to understand what Chinese saying "as thin as the wings of cicadas" means'

Catching the light: Australian Matthew Mackay, 47, also came highly commended for his shot of the light sparkling off kelp on a beach in Victoria

Holiday snap: Retired Brian Sugden, 64, from Banstead in Surrey was wandering down Fort Myers Beach in Florida with his partner Christine when he got this picture of a heron with its catch

Taking flight:  Gabor Dvornik, 53, from Hungary photographed this swallow bathing in a pond. He said: 'It was taken with a bit of luck and patience, as these little birds are very cautious and also very swift."It was a warm day and they were thirsty and hot so became a bit more brave to have a bath in the pond. They went underwater which surprised me and then flew out instantly and with high energy'
