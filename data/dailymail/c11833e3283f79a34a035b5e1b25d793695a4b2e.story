A takeaway service is offering a revolutionary service selling our favourite dishes with a festive twist on Christmas Day including brussels sprouts curry.

Pork and stuffing sushi, mince pie pizza and turkey stuffing kebab with bread sauce will also be available to order on December 25.

The one-of-a-kind dishes were created after the British public were asked to name the fantasy Christmas takeaway dish they would most like to see.

Around one million Facebook were asked to post their views on takeaway Just Eat's website and a specialist chef created the most popular choices.

The 10-inch mince pie pizza is made from 350g mince meat, edible gold star and icing sugar.

Meanwhile, 500g of turkey thigh mince, chestnut stuffing, cranberry relish in a pitta bread with bacon, lettuce and bread sauce creates the festive kebab.

Chipolatas and bacon are used to make the sushi, which is wrapped in cavolo cabbage and 100g of brussels sprouts are used in the spicy curry.

New research shows more than 8,500 takeaway orders were made on Christmas Day last year, with over 500,000 orders made between December 23 and 31.

Almost half of orders were for pizza (43 per cent), a third (30 per cent) for Indian and 8 per cent were for American dishes - fried chicken and chips.

The bespoke dishes were created after more than half (51 per cent) of us said festive food is dull and dry compared to what we normally eat at home.

Meanwhile, just 51 per cent of Brits admit enjoying every part of the meal on Christmas Day, the study of 2,000 Brits found.

It seems the stresses of hosting family and friends this Christmas becomes too much for many Brits, so they order a takeaway.

One in five of us (21 per cent) feel stressed about having to cook big meals for family and friends over Christmas.

Four in ten (40 per cent) plan to order a takeaway during the holiday period this year, the study from takeaway service Just Eat found.

Graham Corfield, Managing Director UK for Just Eat, said: 'We had dozens of great suggestions, which just goes to show many of us would love to reinvent the Christmas plate.

'We also discovered a fair few households that have beaten us to it - in more than one, pizza topped with Christmas dinner is already a tradition.'
