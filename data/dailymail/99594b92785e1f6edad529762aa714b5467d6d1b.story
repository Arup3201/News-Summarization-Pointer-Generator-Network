More than 20 ponies have starved to death on Bodmin Moor, with at least two of the animals dying while giving birth because they were too weak from neglect.

Eight of the ponies had to be shot by Government vets because they were too weak and emaciated to come down from the moor, according to a farmers and landlords group.

One pregnant mare was due to be put down but foaled overnight. Mother and baby have now been taken in by South West Equine Protection along with two other ponies.

Ponies apparently dumped on Bodmin Moor have starved to death due to neglect

It is not known who owned the animals and it appears they had been dumped on the moor and unable to withstand the conditions on the higher ground.

Bodmin ponies are owned by farmers who have grazing rights on the land but they are bound by law to care for them and feed them during the winter.

Julie Dowton, secretary of the commoners' association, said: 'It is an appalling situation. We are absolutely distressed.

'The whole Bodmin Moor farming community is absolutely appalled that it has happened and we now have to look at how we are going to clear it up.'

The long winter has meant farmers have had to spend more on feeding their animals, she said, but added that there was 'no excuse' for letting them starve.

At least two of the ponies died while giving birth because they did not have the strength to survive

'We have some wonderful farmers who really look after their animals but unfortunately in this part of the moor something has gone wrong,' she said.

'We cannot identify the owners, the ponies have no markings on them.

'There is no doubt that some of them are not Bodmin Moor ponies. Why they are here we do not know.'

Twelve corpses were removed from the moor today while more corpses are to be brought down over the coming days

This morning, 12 corpses were brought down from the moor, with more to be taken away in the next few days.

A further 30 ponies, said to be 'borderline', are to be inspected on the moor during the course of the week by Government vets with the hope that they can be nursed back to full health.
