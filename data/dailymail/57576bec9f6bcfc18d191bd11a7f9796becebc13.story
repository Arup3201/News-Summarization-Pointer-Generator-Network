Two college students were shot dead in Mississippi over the weekend in separate incidents.Â 

John Sanderson, 21, was killed in a Mississippi State University dormitory late on Saturday.

Freshman at Jackson State University, Nolan Ryan Henderson III, 19, died when he was shot in the face early on Sunday at an off-campus apartment pool party in Jackson.

Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said in a statement that he was 'saddened to learn that Mississippi lost two college students this weekend.'

'Those perpetuating these crimes will be apprehended and held accountable,' he said.

'Mississippi does not take these instances lightly, and rest assured, we will continue to provide a safe learning environment for students at all our Mississippi College and University campuses.'

At Mississippi State, university president Mark Keenum said in a statement that the killing of Sanderson was the first time a student had been shot on the campus.

Keenum said officials could reveal few other details because of the ongoing investigation.

around 10pm on Saturday. Police were on the scene within a minute. 
Sanderson was taken to Oktibbeha County Hospital, where he died.

Three male suspects fled the building in a blue Crown Victoria, officials said. No arrests had been made Sunday.

Shortly after the shooting, the 
university began sending a series of text message alerts to students. 
Police officers stepped up patrols to make sure the campus was safe, 
Keenum said.

The four-story Evans Hall holds about
300 male students and is located on the north side of campus. The 
campus of about 20,000 students is located in a rural area in the 
northeastern part of the state, about 125 miles northeast of Jackson.

Within a few hours, Jackson police say Henderson was killed.

Police spokeswoman Colendula Green 
said officers early on Sunday found the body of Henderson lying on a 
walkway inside the Palisades Apartments.

Henderson of Atlanta reportedly lived on campus but was attending a pool party at the apartment complex. He was shot one time.

Green said Sunday evening that 
details of what happened were sketchy and that police did not have a 
motive or suspect. JSU students had planned a vigil for Sunday evening.

Hank Bounds, the state's commissioner
of higher education, said in a statement Sunday that both deaths were 
"senseless tragedies and our sympathies go out to each of their 
families."

But Bounds stressed that university 
campuses are "very safe, with many precautions taken and systems in 
place to protect students." He praised Mississippi State for its "swift 
action and communication to students and the university community."
