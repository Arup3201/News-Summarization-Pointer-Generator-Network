Dennis Rodman has named his eclectic team of former NBA players and reality show stars that will play in North Korea next week for dictator Kim Jong Un's birthday.

Rodman will lead the team that includes former NBA All-Stars Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson, and Vin Baker.

Craig Hodges, Doug Christie and Charles D. Smith are on the team, as well. They will play against a top North Korean senior national team on Wednesday, marking Kim Jong Un's birthday.

Controversial: The former NBA player has released a team sheet to fly to Pyongyang after weeks of talks

The American player's rich histories go beyond basketball, reports Buzz Feed.

Kenny Anderson was recently in a play entitled, The Penis Monologues and has appeared on the reality television show, Basketball Wives.

Cliff Robinson was on the Real Housewives of New Jersey and may be a participant in the reality show Survivor next year.

Vin Baker is a former NBA player who drank his way out of playing basketball and is now apparently enrolled at Union Theological Seminary in New York.Â 

Craig Hodges once unsuccessfully sued the NBA in 1996 after he claimed the league discriminated against him due to his political outspokenness and his association with Islamist Louis Farrakhan.

Doug Christie and his wife Jackie were recently featured on their own television series called The Christies Committed on BET J. Jackie also appears on Basketball Wives: LA.

Buzz Feed reports that Christie is known for not wanting to make eye contact with women other than his wife. Whether or not he's willing to make eye contact with infamous world leaders is a different question all together.

Charles D. Smith ran a digital media company, was a motivational speaker, and started an assistance program to help retired players find new careers--the chance of him finding players this gig is unlikely.

Dennis Rodman, famed for his 
unique and controversial relationship with the communist leader Kim Jong Un, flew to
 the state last month to help recruit their national team.

At the time, he confessed he was struggling to persuade any of his former teammates to make the trip to Pyongyang.

Rodman, 52, is the highest profile American to meet with Kim Jong Un since Kim Jong Il passed away in 2011.

Rodman
 made his latest visit to North Korea shortly before Christmas to train 
the North Korean basketball team, though he did not meet with Kim.

Rodman, known as much for his piercings, tattoos and bad behavior as he 
was for basketball, traveled to the secretive state for the first time 
last February with the Harlem Globetrotters for an HBO series produced 
by New York-based VICE television. Rodman has called Kim a 'friend for 
life.'

He claims the game on Wednesday will be an attempt at 'basketball diplomacy'.

'My previous travels have allowed me to feel the enthusiasm and warmth of fans,' Rodman said.

'The positive memories and smiles on the faces of the children and families are a testament to the great efforts we have put into fulfilling our mission wherever we go voiding any politics. We are all looking forward to arriving in Pyongyang, meeting the citizens, visiting various charities and using the opportunity to develop new relationships that result in our annual return,' he continued.

Rodman, the most high profile to meet Kim Jong Un since Kim Jong Il died, is here selecting the North Korean team last month. Holding a cigar and wearing a pink shirt, he told the players the game would be an 'honour'

Speaking after the North Korean team's tryouts, Rodman discussed his teammates concerns.

He
 said: 'You know, they're still afraid to come here, but I'm just 
telling them, you know, don't be afraid man, it's all love, it's all 
love here.

'I understand 
what's going on with the political stuff, and I say, I don't go into 
that venture, I'm just doing one thing for these kids here, and for this
 country, and for my country, and for the world pretty much.'

Addressing
 the North Korean players, he said: 'I want you guys to do one thing for
 your leader. It's his birthday. It's a very special, special day for 
the country.'

It is less than a month since Kim's uncle was dragged from office and executed, but Rodman has refused to comment on the issue, or on the detention of American Kenneth Bae for allegedly committing anti-state crimes.

Instead his focus has been on sport and the basketball game which he hopes will be without political or nationalistic undertones.

North Korea will play against America in the first half, but for the second half the teams will be mixed.

On Christmas Eve, Paddy Power announced it would not be sponsoring the tournament as a result of their boycott of Pyongyang.

Rodman has been criticized for not talking about North Korea's human rights record, described as one of the world's worst by activists, the U.S. State Department and North Korean defectors. The defectors have repeatedly testified about the government's alleged use of indiscriminate killings, rapes, beatings and prison camps holding as many as 120,000 people deemed opponents of authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un, the third generation of his family to rule.
