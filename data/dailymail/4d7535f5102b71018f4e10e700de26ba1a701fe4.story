A woman being sued over her $1million shoe collection says she is 'relieved' after her ex-husband dropped his legal battle.

Hedge fund manager Daniel Shak, 52, 
was fighting to win 35 per cent of the value of ex-wife Beth's 1,200 
luxury shoes, but yesterday dropped the case.

Poker champion Mrs Shak, 42, gave six
 hours of testimony at Montgomery County Courthouse near Philadelphia 
before Mr Shak suddenly stopped his legal action against
 her.

She said: 'Daniel knew he was going to lose. I'm so relieved that he saw sense and decided to give up on this. It was so stupid.'

Surrounded: Beth Shak with some of her 1,200 pairs of designer heels. She claims it was an obsession bordering on illness

Substitute for love: Mrs Shak said 'There was such a lack of emotion and love in my relationship that I filled that void with shopping... I couldn't stop'

She hit the headlines last month when
 Mr Shak accused her of hiding around $1million worth of designer shoes 
in a 'secret room' of their Fifth Avenue apartment during their divorce 
three years ago.

She has 
more than 1,200 pairs of shoes, kept in a number of closets that need a 
PIN code to enter - and even has a tattoo of a Louboutin heel on her 
hip.

She told Judge Ronda Daniele that a lack of love in her marriage drove 
her to seek gratification in shopping, spending hundreds of thousands on
 shoes that she then often simply gave away.

In an interview with the New York Post, Mrs Shak said: 'It really was a sickness... like a disease.

'There was such a lack of emotion and
 love in my relationship that I filled that void with shopping. I was 
shopping endlessly, I couldn’t stop.'

Beth is working on her new shoe website, Shoes R Forever, which was inspired by her new boyfriend Ben Cook

No longer pursuing: Daniel Shak instructed his lawyer to drop the lawsuit over the shoes yesterday

Mr Shak had claimed that he did not know the extent of her shoe collection.

But Mrs Shak told the court that her 
former husband not only knew about the shoes but signed off on all the 
bills for them. She also told the court that it was her husband's 
disinterest in their relationship that drove her into retail therapy in 
the first place.

When asked about the collection, she 
told judge Ronda Daniele: 'I would not call these shoes a collection, I 
would call them a sickness at a particular point in my life.'

When Mr Shak suddenly instructed his 
lawyer to withdraw the lawsuit, Judge Daniele said: 'Well, thanks for 
wasting everybody's time.'

Outside the court, Mrs Shak to the 
Post: 'I wanted love and emotional support and affection, but there was 
nothing... He would always say, "I’m busy. Leave me alone. Just go 
shopping or something". And I would give in and just go do it.

'God only knows how many pairs of shoes I’ve bought in a week.'

Mr Shak's lawsuit 
against his ex-wife stated: ‘In the summer of 2011, Daniel became 
aware that Beth owned and failed to disclose an extensive … collection 
of Christian Louboutin shoes … and other high-end designer shoes.

‘Dan
 trusted his wife and was not inspecting his home to try to find 
inventory or “secret rooms’’.’

The collection is indeed vast and 
includes 700 pairs of Louboutins, costing from $700 to $4,000.

That, 
combined with her reputation as a World Series poker player, has made 
Mrs Shak something of a celebrity in the U.S. She has appeared on 
television to discuss her shoe habit, and is starting to design her own 
range of footwear.

Mrs Shak’s most expensive shoes are a pair of 
black and white cowboy boots once owned by Elizabeth Taylor. She keeps 
them in a glass cabinet of their own with a framed picture of the 
actress on the wall above, although she refused to reveal how much they 
cost.

She now lives in a house near Philadelphia with her 
two youngest children Lindy, 17, and Austin, 15 – and has four storage 
areas around the property for all her footwear.

The main closet, which 
can only be entered using a numerical keypad, is 12ft by 8ft and has 
eight racks, each full of shoes, going from the floor to the ceiling.

New home: Mrs Shak has moved into this new home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her shoes are in special closets that require a PIN code to enter

A second room also has a numerical keypad and is 4ft by 5ft.

There is also a separate rack in another room, where she keeps her formal shoes, and another cupboard for the remainder.

She said: ‘There are shoes that I don’t even remember 
buying. I’m so short of space I had to give a couple of hundred pairs 
away.'
