A hand grenade was found as police investigating a £1million online banks scam arrested four people in raids in London.

The suspected live hand grenade was discovered during a dawn raid at an address in Enfield, north London yesterday morning. Officers also raided an address in Islington, north London.

About £80,000 in cash, luxury goods such as designer jewellery and a Range Rover were also seized in the raids.

Detectives from the Metropolitan Police's new Cyber Crime Unit (MPCCU) carried out the operation after being alerted that a number of bank customers had inadvertently downloaded complex malware onto their computer by opening emails claiming to be from their bank.

Police have said a total of £1million was subsequently siphoned off from their bank accounts and transferred to a series of other accounts, to be laundered and withdrawn as cash.

These accounts have now been frozen.

The operation followed an in-depth investigation with the assistance of several banks.

A number of computers, smart phones and other media devices, were taken away to be forensically examined.

Two 31-year-old men, a 27-year-old woman and a 24-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to launder money, and possession of an explosive.

A Range Rover was also seized during the raids in London

The men are currently in custody at a central London police station. The women have been bailed to return on a date early next year.

DCI Jason Tunn said: 'These arrests by the Met's Cyber Crime Unit follow an investigation into what we suspect is an international and organised crime targeting a number of bank customers in London and across the UK.

'The victims have been hoodwinked by malware-carrying emails purporting to be from their banks, and subsequently had money taken from their accounts.

'The Met's Cyber Crime Unit is determined to protect people and businesses in London from cyber crime, which can see businesses ruined and people's hard-earned money taken from them in a second. We are working closely the banking industry to achieve that.

'We will also seek to restrain and seize criminal profits where possible, in order to remove the financial benefit of online crime from cyber criminals.'
