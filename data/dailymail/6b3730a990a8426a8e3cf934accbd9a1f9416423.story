Some people may think that the spread of herpes is a modern problem.

But scientists have found that Herpes Simplex Virus-1, which manifests itself as cold sores, infected hominids before the evolutionary split from chimpanzees, six million years ago.

While genital herpes, or HSV-2, jumped from ancient chimpanzees to ancestors of modern humans - Homo erectus - approximately 1.6 million years ago, they claim.

Scientists have found that Herpes Simplex Virus-1, which manifests itself as cold sores, infected hominids before the evolutionary split from chimpanzees six million years ago.

Genital herpes, or HSV-2, jumped from ancient chimpanzees to ancestors of modern humans - Homo erectus - approximately 1.6 million years ago.

The 
researchers compared the HSV-1 and HSV-2 gene sequences to the family 
tree of simplex viruses from eight monkey and ape host species.

Using
 advanced models of molecular evolution, they were able to estimate 
ancient viral divergence times more accurately than before.

This
 allowed the experts to determine when HSV-1 and HSV-2 were introduced 
into humans with far more precision than previous models, which do not 
account for natural selection over the course of viral evolution.

This jump occurred long before the rise of early modern humans about 200,000 years ago.

’Before we were human, there was still cross-species transmission into our evolutionary lineage,’ said Joel Wertheim, assistant research scientist at the University of California San Diego.

Modern versions viruses are spread by intimate contact and HSV-1 can also be spread by sharing drinks.

‘The results help us to better understand how these viruses evolved and found their way into humans,’ Dr Wertheim explained.

‘Animal disease reservoirs are extremely important for global public health.

'Understanding where our viruses come from will help guide us in preventing future viruses from making the jump into humans.’

It is 
thought that two thirds of the human population is infected with at 
least one form of the virus, which shows itself as cold sores on the 
mouth or blisters on the genitals.

Dr Wertheim said: ‘Humans are the only primates we know of that have two herpes simplex viruses. We wanted to determine why.’

Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) both infect humans.

HSV-1 produces cold sores, while HSV-2 produces genital herpes.

Both are contagious and can be shared from direct contact as well as contact with saliva.

Symptoms of the viruses include watery blisters on the skin, which can be painful.

HSV-1 and HSV-2 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system.

After initial infection, some people experience sporadic outbreaks.

The researchers compared the HSV-1 and HSV-2 gene sequences to the family tree of simplex viruses from eight monkey and ape host species.

Using advanced models of molecular evolution, they were able to estimate ancient viral divergence times more accurately than before.

This allowed the experts to determine when HSV-1 and HSV-2 were introduced into humans with far more precision than previous models, which do not account for natural selection over the course of viral evolution.

The genetics of human and primate herpes viruses were examined to assess their similarity.

Scientists
 found that HSV-1 has been present in humans far longer than HSV-2, 
prompting the researchers to further investigate the origins of HSV-2 in
 humans.

The viral family tree showed that HSV-2 was far more genetically similar to the herpes virus found in chimpanzees.

This
 level of divergence indicates that humans must have acquired HSV-2 from
 an ancestor of modern chimpanzees about 1.6 million years ago, prior to
 the rise of modern humans roughly 200,000 years ago.

‘Comparing
 virus gene sequences gives us insight into viral pathogens that have 
been infecting us since before we were humans,’ Dr Wertheim said.
