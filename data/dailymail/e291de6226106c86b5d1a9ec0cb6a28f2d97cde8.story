In an effort to find a love match, she had to choose between a true blue tradie, a motorbike daredevil, a business owner and a business development manager.

Without the four hopefuls knowing who the bachelorette was, Ms Lambie asked the first question: 'What is something a woman can do that really makes her stand out to you?'

While the potential dates were only identified by numbers, the outspoken politician was already impressed with  bachelors three or four.

Bachelor three responded: 'Outgoing and fun'.

While bachelor four said: 'Someone who's not worried about what other people think but just is [sic] being themselves'.

When asked if she liked any response out of the men? She responded: 'I do, I like the last two actually. The last two.'

It comes after Ms Lambie stirred controversy after telling radio listeners she wanted a rich man 'well-hung'

The mother-of-two told a radio station in July last year that she had not been in a relationship for 11 years

She asked her second question: 'What's the one thing I like most about you?'

Judging from responses, it seems Ms Lambie wants a man who is a good listener, genuine and a glass half full kind-of person with a stunning smile as she picked bachelors three and four again.

Third question: 'In my line of work, everyone's up for a fight. What kind of personality do you have when it comes to an argument?'

Bachelor number three starting off the response: 'I'm very reasonable but I'm certainly strong enough to stand up for what's right.'

Bachelor number four's response: 'I would say Jelly. Jelly. Just get in there and wrestle it out.'

The final question she asked was: 'When you get older and look back on your life, what would you have hope to achieved?'

Bachelor number four was the favourite pick amongst the four men as the pair were set to meet each other

Starting off with bachelor number four, he says: 'I like to look back to have been the successful bachelor on a perfect match - you've got a chance to make a dream or to destroy one'.

Bachelor number one said: 'To have a nice family and be happy for the rest of my life.'

With 10 seconds of thinking-time and a classic love tune to set the mood, the bachelorette picked bachelor number four - Matt Tonkiss from Sydney.

Meeting her perfect match, she was asked what her initial thoughts were on her new man.

'He seems quite charming - he seems very funny so it's always good to have a sense of humour. I like the good sense of humour and he was quite relaxed over the whole situations.'

Tonkiss was asked whether he was surprised by his bachelorette, he responded: 'A little. We'll see how we go'. 

As Ms Lambie said: 'Let's see what you're made of.' 

Hugging it out: the pair seem overwhelmed as they say they'll  see how it all goes before making judgement

It's understood that Weekend Today will fly Matt Tonkiss down to Tasmania for the date with Ms Lambie

The dating stunt comes after Ms Lambie triggered a shock on the airwaves in July last year, telling listeners that she preferred a rich man 'well-hung'.

Appearing on Heart 107.3, she revealed she had not been in a relationship for 11 years as radio hosts Kim Napier and Dave Noonan invited callers who wanted to date the senator to phone in.

Ms Lambie revealed her criteria for a man, saying: 'They must have heaps of cash and they've got to have a package between their legs, let's be honest.

'I don't need them to speak, they don't even need to speak.'

She later apologised for her comments to a 22-year-old caller named Jamie, who was interested in dating the 43-year-old mother-of-two, though he did not seem to know who Ms Lambie was and sounded surprised to learn she was a federal senator.
