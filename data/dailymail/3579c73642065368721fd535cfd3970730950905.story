Brooke Tsakirakis with her fiance Nick Emery, who demanded £35,000 from England captain Eoin Morgan to prevent release of sexual messages

The Australian woman at the heart of a blackmail plot against the England cricket captain said she was ‘ropeable angry’ as she broke her silence last night.

Brooke Tsakirakis, 36, made the remark, which means angry to the point of having to be restrained, as she revealed she has ditched her fiance following the scandal.

Nick Emery, a safety consultant from Tasmania, demanded £35,000 from England captain Eoin Morgan to prevent the release of sexual messages and videos of Morgan with Miss Tsakirakis from five years ago. 

Emery claimed the pair had been in recent contact, although Morgan is in a three-year relationship with Australian Tara Ridgway – who is said to be fully backing him.

Last night Miss Tsakirakis, a mother of two, strenuously denied being in touch with the new one-day captain and insisted both had been single when they had an affair.

The England Cricket Board (ECB) called in Scotland Yard detectives last Wednesday after Emery emailed his demands. He was quickly tracked and the ECB decided not to press charges, but details of the scandal emerged the night before England’s match in Hobart, Tasmania.

‘I don’t want to air mine and Nick’s dirty laundry but I’m gutted,’ a tearful Miss Tsakirakis told the Australian press. 

‘I’m ropeable angry. I’m furious but I don’t think right now that anger towards him is worth wasting my energy on because I have to protect my children. They are my first priority.’

‘Ropeable’ is an Australian slang term dating from the 19th century, thought to have originally been used to refer to horses. Similar to the British term ‘fit to be tied’, it means being so wild or angry that you have to be roped down.

The gym worker, from Hobart, said her messages with Morgan – which she backed up on Emery’s computer – were from so long ago she did not remember them, and were simply chatting ‘to and fro’.

She believes Emery hacked into an old, inactive Facebook account.

She added: ‘Some of it may have been romantic or sexually explicit, but it was nothing more than what any two people who are consenting adults independent of anyone else might say to each other.

‘What upsets me the most are the reports in the media that Nick has said he had evidence of contact between me and Eoin in the last 12 months. I deny that completely. I have never been in contact with Eoin while I’ve been in a relationship with Nick. Well, Nick and I don’t have a relationship any longer.’

Morgan claimed the issue had not affected him but was bowled out first ball – a golden duck – against Australia last Friday.

Miss Tsakirakis added: ‘I feel for Eoin and his partner because we are all innocent parties. I don’t even want to be vindictive about Nick but I’m not going to take responsibility for his actions.’
