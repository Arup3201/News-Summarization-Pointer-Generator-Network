A plan to make teenage girls undergo virginity tests in an Indonesian city has sparked outrage.

Muhammad Rasyid, head of the education office in South Sumatra's district of Prabumulih, said he wants to start the tests next year to discourage premarital sex and protect against prostitution.

But Indonesian officials have dismissed the proposal as unethical.

The country's education minister Education Minister Mohammad Nuh dismissed the plans saying:'If the goal is improvement, so that our children avoid negative things,
there are more noble ways,' Education Minister Mohammad Nuh reportedly 
told reporters at the State Palace in Jakarta.

'If they are not virgins, then what? Will they not be allowed to go to school?' asked the minister, according to Khabar.

After the outcry Rasyid decided to clarify his statement to the Jakarta Post newspaper.

Questions: 'If they are not virgins, then what? Will they not be allowed to go to school?' asked education minister

'We never planned a virginity test for female students,' he wrote, reported Al Jazeera.

'We were only approving the request made by the parents of a student after she was accused of no longer being a virgin by a suspect in a human trafficking case.'

Aris Merdeka Sirait of the National Commission for Child Protection, said the plan was 'just aimed for popularity' reported The Telegraph.

'Loss of virginity is not merely because of sexual activities. It could be caused by sports or health problems and many other factors,' Sirait said. 'We strongly oppose this very excessive move.'

Indonesia is a predominantly Islamic country, with more than 200million Muslims living in the South-East Asian nation.
