France is considering a ban on electronic cigarettes from public places and subject them to the same tight controls as tobacco, the government has announced.

The move has sparked outrage among sellers and users of the battery-powered devices which contain liquid nicotine that is turned into a vapor when inhaled.

Health Minister Marisol Touraine also wants unbranded cigarette packaging, covered with at least 65 per cent health warnings.

France's health minister has proposed a ban on smoking e-cigarettes in public places

And Ms Touraine intends to give smokers the right to seek hefty damage settlements from tobacco companies, similar to billion-dollar class action lawsuits in the U.S.

The minister, who intends to put her bill before parliament within weeks, said: 'The e-cigarette is not an ordinary product. We need to apply the same measures as there are for tobacco.

'That means making sure it cannot be smoked in public places, that its sale is restricted to over 18s and that firms are not allowed to advertise the products.'

Under French law, e-cigarettes are currently legal to use in bars, restaurants and other public places where traditional smoking has been banned for five years.

A ban would harm the booming e-cigarette industry in France, where around 500,000 people use the gadgets, vendors insist.

Darren Moon, the English owner of online store Vapshop.fr, said: 'If they ban it in public or in the workplace, I'll be closing my store, or moving it somewhere where there aren't restrictions like that.

E-cigarette users will no longer be able to inhale the nicotine vapour if a proposed new bill in France is passed

'Twenty per cent of our business is selling disposable e-cigarettes to restaurants, clubs, bars and hotels. So if there's a workplace ban, I'd have to start firing people.'

E-cigarettes were invented in China in 2003, as many nations began imposing bans on smoking, and are aimed at giving the user a similar sensation to smoking a cigarette.

They were thought to be much healthier than normal smoking is because they do not contain the tobacco and other carcinogens found in cigarettes.

But many experts have since expressed concerns about certain chemicals contained in the liquid, notably the compound propylene glycol.

In May 2011, the French health agency AFSSAPS advised against using the  devices, saying they still contained nicotine, which even at a low concentration could lead to 'damaging side effects'.

But other scientists have hit back against the report claiming it is scaremongering.

Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos, a cardiology researcher at University Hospital Gathuisberg in Belgium, said: 'Findings such as these should always be compared to the risks of smoking ordinary cigarettes.

'There are also many experts who believe smoking e-cigarettes is many times less dangerous than the real thing.'

A group
 of leading health experts have claimed e-cigarettes could save millions
 of lives and should not be classed as a tobacco product.

In a letter published yesterday, ,more than 50 researchers and specialists 
from around the globe signed a letter stating that e-cigarettes 
have the potential to save millions of lives.

The letter urges health officials to 
consider the health consequences of such a move, amid fears e-cigarettes
 will become harder to obtain.

As a result, they should not be regulated in the same way as conventional cigarettes, they say.

The signatories include the leading 
smoking cessation psychologist Professor Robert West, from University 
College London, and experts who have advised the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on its guidelines about reducing the 
harm from tobacco.

Various bans on e-cigarettes are in place in several countries around the world.

The countries currently with restrictions are Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Brunai, Colombia, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Panama, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UAE, Uruguay and Venezuela.

In the U.S, New York and Chicago have also banned the cigarettes from public places. Regulations were changed mean they now fall under the same set of rules as tobacco cigarettes.

Louisiana has also banned e-cigarette sales to minors.

In the UK, the use of e-cigarettes in public places in England is not outlawed, but plans being considered by Public Health England show proposals could be drafted to ban the devices from offices and other public spaces.

The minutes from one of the organisation's meetings reveal concerns that they could 'renormalise smoking'. It has also been reported the British Medical Association now wants them included in the smoking ban.

Pub chain JD Wetherspoon and some train operators have already banned the devices.

Leaked documents have also suggested all electronic cigarettes that are currently on sale in Britain would be banned and removed from the shop shelves under new European Union proposals. 

In November, The Daily Telegraph reported that Brussels officials fear that there is a 'risk that electronic 
  cigarettes can develop into a gateway to normal cigarettes'.
