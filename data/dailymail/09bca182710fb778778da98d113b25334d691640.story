Teenage hackers hijacked highly sensitive telephone conversations on Scotland Yard’s anti-terrorist hotline and posted recordings on YouTube.

Anarchist group TeamPoison claimed 
responsibility and said it was 'easy' to bypass the 
force's security - which they said was 'from the 80s'.

They claim to have compromised a server from Malaysia to record conversations.

The force launched an investigation today after being made aware that the phone calls may have been hacked.

The attack is the latest in a series of 
embarrassing security breaches, and comes after 'hacktivist' group 
Anonymous brought down the official Home Office website last Saturday.

Scotland Yard's hotline is understood to have been hit with more than 700 calls before an American-sounding caller, using the name Trick, told them they were being 'pranked'.

Detectives said 'appropriate action would be taken' after a number of recordings were posted on YouTube.

In one of the clips, a man identifying himself as Trick is heard telling an officer: 'Knowledge is power... We embarrass governments and f*** the police.'

The hackers overwhelmed a computer server used to host sensitive phone calls using a simple computer script to infiltrate the system.

The 'Asterisk' phone server was controlled for 24 hours by the anarchist group, TeamPoison.

Hacking phone networks - known as 'phreaking', a term which was in use before computer hacking even existed - allows malicious hackers to listen in or send messages to phone users on computerised exchanges.

'Phreaking' was a predecessor to today's hacking - Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was a 'phreaker' himself in the early Seventies.

Nowadays, computerised phone systems mean that hackers can use computer-hacking skills to 'get inside' phone systems and eavesdrop on calls.

'Trick' is later heard laughing when a
woman comes on to the line to tell him that the phone call was being 
passed on to the FBI.

In another recording, officers appear to be discussing counter-terror operations while TeamPoison listens in.

The group claimed to have then made 
calls to MI6 - but it is understood they were in fact picked up by the 
Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command.

A Met Police statement said: 'We are aware of an issue whereby hoaxers have made calls to the anti-terrorist hotline and have made recordings of their conversations with anti-terrorist hotline staff.

'In addition, recordings have been made of conversations between Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) Anti-Terrorist Hotline staff.

'The MPS has launched an investigation into this matter.'

Trick, reportedly a 17-year-old who launched TeamPoison in 2010, said the group bypassed outdated technology and used a server from Malaysia to record conversations.

A statement from Trick read: 'The phone denial of service was done via a custom script for Asterisk which was installed on an overseas server.

'The conversation was tapped into via a private phreaking method, their phone system is old and we found a way to get in via basic but private phreaking technique.'

Hacked: Scotland Yard has launched an investigation after discovering that confidential calls to its anti-terrorist hotline were recorded by hackers

In response to the Scotland Yard statement, @-TeaMp0isoN tweeted: 'OH REALLY NOW.'

When asked whether he found it simple to overcome MI6 security, Trick emailed: 'Yes it was easy :)'

The group has been linked to alleged hacking attempts on Facebook and a personal email account linked to a former staff member of Tony Blair's.

Terror suspect: Briton Babar Ahmad has been fighting for the right to be tried in the UK, but can now be extradited to the U.S.

TeamPoison said it deluged counter-terrorism officers with phone calls for 24 hours, ensuring no other calls could get through.

The group claimed its attacks were prompted by a recent decision made by the European Court of Human Rights, which allowed UK-linked terror suspects Babar Ahmad and Adel Abdel to be extradited to America.    

By targeting the phones, the group essentially carried out the telephonic equivalent of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack - an approach often used by online hackers against Government websites.

The audio recording released by TeamPoison appears to feature an MI6 officer saying, 'You are blocking these lines. People cannot get through when you’re constantly coming through here with your fun calls.' 

Trick told download site SoftPedia: 'Every time they picked up the phone the server would play a robot voice which said "teampoison".'

In a recording thought to be the conversation between Trick and MI6 officers, the teenager can be heard saying, 'My name is Trick, I'm from TeamPoison - my name is Robert West', before a female officer asks, 'What's your date of birth, Robert?

'April 4, 1991,' he replies.

A male voice is then heard wishing 'Robert' 'happy birthday for last week', and asking if he received any nice presents.

The hacker then changes tack, saying, 'I got some terrorism for you here.'

Challenged about his use of an American accent, the young man adds, 'I don't brush my teeth, I like tea, I'm from the UK.'

'What's your actual philosophy?' asks the male official. 'I'm not actually 
familiar with it.'

'Our philosophy is pretty simple: it's knowledge is power,' the hacker says. 'And, uh, f**k the po-lice.'

The call is terminated as the female operative states, 'Your information and everything about you is being passed to the FBI.'

Another recording released by the hacktivists allegedly features MI6 staff discussing the group's attack.

Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist 
hotline was set up in 1991 to encourage the public to report possible 
terrorist activity, and has been the subject of several costly newspaper
and radio advertising campaigns. 

A section of the Metropolitan Police's website dedicated to the hotline gives the following advice to users:

'We
want you to look out for the unusual – some activity or behaviour which
strikes you as not quite right and out of place in your normal day to 
day lives.

'You may 
feel it’s probably nothing, but unless you trust your instincts and tell
us we won’t be able to judge whether the information you have is 
important or not.

'Remember, no piece of information is considered too small or insignificant.

'Our
specially trained officers would rather take lots of calls which are 
made in good faith, but have innocent explanations – rather than not 
getting any at all.'

Addressing
concerns about secrecy, it goes on, 'We know you may have concerns 
about speaking to the police – possibly because your friends or family 
may find out.

'But all 
information passed to the police is treated in the strictest of 
confidence. It is thoroughly analysed and researched by experienced 
officers before, and if, any police action is taken.'
