The parents of a two-year-old boy are in a Florida prison after the boy was found wandering alone at night in a mobile home park wearing only a soiled diaper.

Joseph P Rupp, 23, and Nikki Hinkle, 26, were located by police about 15 minutes after police found their toddler, dressed only in a soiled diaper and covered in Magic Marker alone, in the Orange City Mobile Home Park.

Authorities believe the child was alone in the park for at least 20 minutes before the couple's Volusia neighbors noticed the child and alerted police.

Arrested: Joseph Rupp (left), 23, and Nikki Hinkle (right), 26, admitted being passed out while their young son wandered around a Florida trailer park alone

Mobile home: The pair live in the Orange City RV Resort, where neighbors noticed the little boy and called 911

Officers found Rupp, who led them back to the home he shares with Hinkle and their son.

There, Hinkle was found along with marijuana and drug paraphernalia.

According to WKMG, narcotics were in potential reach of the child.

A reporter for WKMG asked Hinkle, as she was led away in cuffs, if she is a bad parent.

'F*** off,' was her response. 

Alone and filthy: Nikki Hinkle (seen left after her arrest) and her boyfriend has been charged with child neglect and drug-related crimes after her toddler son was found covered in marker and dressed only in a filthy diaper

She then told the reporter that the reason her child was alone was that she was 'sick and sleeping.'

According to WKMG, police say both parents admited to being passed out inside their trailer park home when the boy managed to get out.

They have both been charged with child neglect, marijuana possession and possession of drug paraphernalia.

The little boy has been released into the care of a relative.
