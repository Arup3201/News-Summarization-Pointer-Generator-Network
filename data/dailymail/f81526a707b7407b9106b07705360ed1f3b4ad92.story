Burger bonanza: Food, drink and travel website Thrillist went through over 20 million check-ins on Foursquare - a location-based application that people use to register their whereabouts and leave tips for others - to map out America's most popular burger restaurants. They are ranked in most popular to least in the key above 

Winner: The most popular burger joint in the U.S., according to users of FourSquare, is Hardee's, home of the Mile High Burgers

Jack in the box: This Canadian-made outlet shows up strongest in the Northwest

Burger King: A surprisingly low number for the home of the Whopper, which proved most popular in upstate New York and Nebraska

Culver's: Most famous in its native Wisconsis, alot of other Americans are now fans of the famous ButterBurger

Checkers: Just as Carl's Jr reigned supreme in the west, these double drive-thru restaurants get eaten up in the west, particularly Florida and Pennsylvania 

Carl's Jr: A major divide, this charbroiled burger chain fared increasingly popular in the west, but no love east of Texas and Oklahoma

Dairy Queen: While not specifically popular in one area. Dairy Queen did fairly well across the board, although surprisingly low in Florida and Texas

 The restaurant took the most amount of states - especially Montana, North Dakota, the Carolinas and West Virginia - but was also spread fairly well across the country.

Surprisingly the dominant franchises - McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's - registered the lowest in popularity.

However Thrillist contends these old favorites still are favorable.

They just didn't show up on the FourSquare data because customers would be less-likely to check-in at one of the restaurants.

The resultant map, while limited to just users of the app, is a good guide to seeing what burger is most-popular in each state by scanning through each.

Last quarter McDonald’s saw its U.S. sales fall 3 percent as profits tumbled 30 percent, according to The Intercept.

It was the 12th straight month of falling sales at the fast food giant.

Five Guys Burgers and Fries: This ever-increasing chain has moved out of Washington DC and up into the Eastern Seaboard

In-N-Out Burger: Perhaps most famous California, In-N-Out is actually most popular in Nevada

Krystal: Although concentrated in one area, Krystal dominated in the southwest, especially Tennessee, where it's from

Sonic: Famous for their shakes, Sonic turned up interestingly small numbers in Oklahoma, its birthplace

Steak 'n Shake: Home of the Frisco Melt, this old favorite hits its prime in central Illinois

Wendy's: Even the bacon pretzel cheeseburger didn't get more people into Wendy's, however Thrillist contends that FourSquare users would be less likely to check-in to this popular chain

Whataburger: Texans have a firm hold of their triple meat hamburgers and aren't letting it

White Castle: New Jersey, Kentucky, Chicago and St. Louis - and Harold and Kumar - love White Castle

McDonald's: As with Burger King and Wendy's, McDonald's did not register well on FourSquare, mostly because people wouldn't likely check-in at the Golden Arches
