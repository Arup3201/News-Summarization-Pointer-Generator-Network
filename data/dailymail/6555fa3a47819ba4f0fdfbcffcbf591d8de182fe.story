A team of specially-trained U.S. commandos infiltrated North Korea in a spy mission focused on the regime’s nuke program, according to a controversial report that the U.S. military denies.

The allegations are sure to stoke already sensitive tensions between Washington and Pyongyang.

According to a report yesterday in The Diplomat, Brigadier Gen Neil H. Tolley acknowledged that U.S. and South Korean special forces have parachuted into the North to get a closer look at underground military tunnels the regime has constructed.

Fact or fiction? The U.S. military has sent special forces into North Korea in secret parachuting missions, according to a report that the U.S. military denies

Statement: Brigadier Gen Neil H. Tolley, right, was quoted as saying that U.S. commandos have parachuted into the North for a closer look at military tunnels the regime has constructed

'The entire tunnel infrastructure is hidden from our satellites,' the online magazine reported Gen Tolley as saying at a Florida press conference last week.

'So we send [South Korean] soldiers and U.S. soldiers to the North to do special reconnaissance.'

If true, the mission would break rules set in place by the 1953 armistice agreement that marked the end of the Korean War.

A portion of the document states: 'No person, military or civilian, shall be permitted to cross the military demarcation line unless specifically authorized to do so by the Military Armistice Commission.'

Violation: If true, the mission would break rules set in place by the armistice agreement that marked the end of the Korean War, which prohibit soldiers or civilians from crossing into North Korea

Gen Tolley is the commanding general of the Special Operations Command, United State Forces Korea, according to a biography on the National Guard website.

The report in the Japan-based online magazine was met with strong opposition in Washington, where U.S. military officials denied such an operation ever took place.

As news of the alleged reconnaissance mission spread, United States Forces Korea spokesman Col Jonathan Withington, disputed the report.

Leader: Kim Jong Un rose to power in North Korea following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December

In a statement, Col Withington said: 'Quotes have been made up and attributed to [Gen Tolley]. No U.S. or [South Korean] forces have parachuted into North Korea.'

Today, The Diplomat, which has since removed the article from its site, issued a clarification of the original report: 

‘In response to the controversy that has attended yesterday's story on North Korea, The Diplomat has sought corroboration.

‘While the author strongly disputes the contention that any quote was fabricated, we acknowledge the possibility that Brig Gen Tolley was speaking hypothetically, about future war plans rather than current operations. 

AFP reported that the writer of the piece, David Axe, stood by the story, telling the agency that if the general was speaking hypothetically, 'he did not say so.'

Mr Axe added that Gen Tolley 'spoke in the present tense' and 'at length.'

For observers of North Korea, little has changed since the death of longtime rule Kim Jong Il in December, and his son Kim Jong Un’s rise to power.

'None,' said Andrei Lankov, a scholar on the North at Seoul's Kookmin University, when asked if he had seen signs of significant change since December.

Lankov said: 'The young dictator is still controlled and surrounded by the old guard, the same people who for many years formulated and executed his father's polices, so it is too early to expect any noticeable change.'
