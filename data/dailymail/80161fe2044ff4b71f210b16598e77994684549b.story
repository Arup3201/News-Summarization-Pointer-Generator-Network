Ronnie O’Sullivan claimed a memorable fifth Coral UK Championship title last night – having played the tournament with a broken ankle.

The Rocket saw off natural heir apparent Judd Trump 10-9 in a thriller at York’ s Barbican Centre to pocket the £150,000 first prize.

He shrugged off a brilliant late fightback from his opponent, who made breaks of 120, 127 and 86 to close to force a tense decider from 9-4 adrift.

And there was even late anxiety for O’Sullivan over forgetting to pack enough pants – dashing into the city to stock up on underwear before the showpiece.

O’Sullivan had fractured his ankle bone on the eve of the event while out running in Epping Forest near his Essex home.

But the 39-year-old raced into a 5-1 lead at the tournament where it all started for him as a 17-year-old, setting for his first major trophy.

And despite a superb rally from the 25-year-old world No7 Trump, the 2011 UK winner, O’Sullivan closed out the match.

At one stage it had looked like Trump was about to pull off one of the most famous snooker comebacks, up there with Dennis Taylor against Steve Davis at the Crucible final in 1985.

O’Sullivan said: “I have had to dig really deep in this tournament, especially with the foot over these last 12 days. It has been very hard, so these are great moments.

“I don’t know how I won after seeing him come back from 9-4 down. He hardly missed a ball and I was gone.

“If I had lost with that big a lead I would have been severely disappointed, the pressure was mounting.

“I just know after the other Champion of Champions final last month I don’t want to be playing Judd every time in these, he is such a tough opponent.”

Trump said: “I wanted to get a good start, and you can’t afford to give Ronnie a five-frame lead – but I didn’t bottle it and played well. I just left it too late once again. 

Four-time champion O'Sullivan was not at his best but still manged to establish a 5-3 interval lead

“I felt very relaxed out there and am just a bit annoyed I didn’t get a good chance in the decider, because I knew I had that form in me.”

Trump is often seen as the natural successor to O’Sullivan, a reputation helped along nicely when he became the youngest player to make a 147 maximum break in a competitive match at just 14.

A natural showman who thrived on atmosphere and big crowds, his initial progress on tour was hindered by qualifying matches played with neither present.

The breakthrough was inevitable though and came in 2011 with a first ranking title at the China Open, huge credit in defeat despite a world final loss to John Higgins in Sheffield, and success in the UK event with a 10-8 win over Mark Allen.

Trump managed a break of 50 to level at 1-1 – but then lost the next four frames with some nerves taking hold.

Trump had noted before the final that O’Sullivan had not been at his best last week despite a 13th career 147 break – but expected him to raise the bar for the showpiece.

And he was right, with the Rocket knocking in breaks of 82 and 81 – only for Trump to keep the contest alive by pocketing the last two frames of the afternoon.

The players emerged to a deafening reception in the evening, and O’Sullivan kept his foot on the gas by quickly extending his lead to 7-3. Trump clung on, but a magnificent break of 133, the 770th of O’Sullivan’s career, re-established his four-frame advantage.

From 9-4 down Trump rallied, and back to back centuries of 120, 127 and 86 left him at just 9-8 adrift. He got to 9-9 – but O’Sullivan closed it out.
