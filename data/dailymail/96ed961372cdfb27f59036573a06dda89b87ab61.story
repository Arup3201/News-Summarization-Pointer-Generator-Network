Wat hero: Air Vice Marshall Robert Bateson was awarded medals to honour his bravery

The bravery medals awarded to the fearless pilot who led 'spectacular' low-level bombing raids on Gestapo headquarters during the Second World War are set to go up for sale.

Air Vice-Marshall Robert 'Pinpoint' Bateson, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) and Distinguished Service Order (DSO), alongside 10 other medals for his remarkable achievements during the War.

All are expected to fetch up to £25,000 when they go on sale next month, a tribute to the courageous man who directed attacks which blew Gestapo headquarters to pieces.

The pilot led a special force of Mosquitos on the dangerous raids in The Hague in the Netherlands, Copenhagen and Odense in Denmark.

His notable exploits included targeting offices in Copenhagen on 21 March 1945 which was crucial to the success of the war.

Pilots had spent weeks meticulously 
organising the attack, even creating models representing the city and 
the Gestapo building to prepare themselves.

The target was a six-storey U-shaped building which housed the entire Gestapo staff for the whole of Denmark.

According to the RAF, the Mosquitos took off in three waves 
of six, together with two Mosquitos of the RAF Film Unit at exactly nine
o'clock in the morning - just in time to meet the Gestapo workers who would be 
arriving at the Headquarters.

The first wave of planes attacked the 
Headquarters from roof top level, flying so close to the target that one
aircraft struck one of the 
buildings and, despite attempting to fly with a 
damaged wing, later crashed in one of the city's 
boulevards.

A reconnaissance aircraft 
photographed the area the day after the operation, showing the extent of
the damage the Mosquitos wreaked on the headquarters.

A
photograph received later showed the building ablaze from end to end 
proving that the fraught mission was a resounding successful.

The leading navigator did his job so 
thoroughly that all the aircraft landed back at base only two minutes 
after the original schedule.

According to the RAF, German officials later denied many were injured, stating that officers were out at a funeral at the time of the attack, but official 
information confirmed that 151 Gestapo men were killed and 30 
Danish patriots imprisoned in the building got away.

Now the war hero's achievements will go under the hammer, as buyers clamour to purchase the historical pieces which commemorate his bravery.
