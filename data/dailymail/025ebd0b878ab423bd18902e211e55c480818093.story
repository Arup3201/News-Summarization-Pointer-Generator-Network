Australian military aircraft will start flying support operations over Iraq from Wednesday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott says.

Mr Abbott said the federal cabinet had not yet approved combat flights, but early warning and control aircraft and refuellers were being deployed into Iraq.

'Australian aircraft from today will start flying over Iraq in support of allied operations,' he told parliament.

'Ours are support operations, not strike missions.

'Australian air strikes await final clearances from the Iraqi government and a further decision by our own.'

He said international security and Australia's national security were 'indivisible'.

This comes days after RAAF aircraft conducted their first training missions in the Middle East region.

Defence said F/A-18F Super Hornets, an E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft and KC-30A airborne refueler all conducted preliminary flights from Australia's Middle East base on Sunday.

That was aimed at familiarising aircrew of the Air Task Group with local conditions and coalition procedures so they can operate in the coalition command and control network.

These missions will continue this week.

The government  hasn't said yet whether IS would be targeted in Syria as well as Iraq.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said any decision on a combat role should not be rushed.

'We support the government taking the time to get it right,' he said.

He reiterated the four conditions behind the opposition's support for the government on a potential combat role.

Labor's support does not extend to ground combat forces and is only confined to Iraq, not Syria.

Mr Shorten also welcomed work on the legal and diplomatic framework under way to support Australia's Iraq operations.

He offered support to the 600 Australian Defence Force personnel stationed in the Middle East.

'We wish them a safe and successful mission and a speedy return to the ones they love.'

All aircraft in the Air Task Group are conducting their first ever combat deployments.

The Super Hornets can conduct precision strikes against IS ground units and supply lines in support of Iraqi and Kurdish forces.

The Wedgetail, regarded as the most advanced aircraft of its type in the world, can coordinate movement of coalition aircraft in what's likely to be very crowded airspace over the battlefield.

Australia's tanker aircraft will contribute to the air campaign by refueling coalition aircraft, allowing extended missions.

A 200-strong ground force, including special forces, stands ready to advise security forces inside Iraq.
