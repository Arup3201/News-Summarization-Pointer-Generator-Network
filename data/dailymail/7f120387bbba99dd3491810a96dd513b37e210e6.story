 A Pittsburgh house fire left six dead Saturday morning including four children and two adults and one in critical condition.

The fire in McKeesport claimed the lives of 27-year-old Hope Jordan, her four children and Ronald Egenlauf, 56, a paralytic, dead after it broke out around 6.42am in their two-story home.

Keith Egenlauf is the only survivor and is now in critical condition at the UPMC Mercy hospital in Pittsburgh with burns over 55 percent of his body, authorities say.

The Facebook of Egenlauf and Jordan indicate that the two have been married since Dec. 7. 

Egenlauf's aunt Donna Ackerman told the Associated Press that both he and Jordan escaped the fire then returned to the house to save Egenlauf's father and Jordan's four children. 

Ackerman said that though Egenlauf was burned, he managed to escape a second time.

Neighbor: A nearby neighbor said he called 911 after hearing screaming and seeing that the house was on fire

A nearby neighbor, DeAndre Jackson, told WPXI that he called 911 after he saw the house on fire.

'I kept hearing someone screaming but I didn't know where it was coming from,' Jackson said, 'and then I went to my window and the blinds were flashing so I opened the blinds and I saw the guy and I saw the whole house lit on fire, and then we just ran outside, called 911.' 

Alvin Henderson Jr., the county’s fire marshal and chief of Emergency Services told the Pittsburgh Post Gazette that though the cause of the fire has not been determined, there is no indication that the fire is suspicious.  

Lone survivor: Egenlauf is the only survivor and is now in critical condition at the UPMC Mercy hospital in Pittsburgh with burns over 55 percent of his body

Not suspicious: Alvin Henderson Jr., the county’s fire marshal and chief of Emergency Services said that though the cause of the fire has not been determined, there is no indication that the fire is suspicious
