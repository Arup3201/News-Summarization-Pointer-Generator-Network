Liverpool have opened preliminary talks with Bayern Munich over a proposed £16m deal for Xherdan Shaqiri.

Manager Brendan Rodgers is growing impatient over Southampton's reluctance to bend on a deal for Adam Lallana, with sporting director Les Reed saying the England international should stay 'a little longer' at St Mary's.

Liverpool have checked on Lazar Markovic too at Benfica but Swiss international Shaqiri offers better market value.

Negotiations: Liverpool have started preliminary talks with Bayern Munich over £16m-rated Xherdan Shaqiri

International duty: Shaqiri is currently in action for Switzerland at the World Cup in Brazil

The 22-year-old had been earmarked to replace Franck Ribery at Bayern but has grown impatient at his lack of playing time and is keen to move to Anfield.

Shaqiri started just 10 matches in the Bundesliga last season, contributing to Bayern's title win mainly from the bench.

He is currently on international duty with Switzerland at the World Cup in Brazil and completed the full 90 minutes in their opening 2-1 win over Ecuador.

Liverpool will also target the Wolfsburg left-back Ricardo Rodriguez if they fail to agree a deal for Alberto Moreno.

The Sevilla star has been a long-term target for Rodgers but a move to Anfield appears to have hit the rocks.

Liverpool thought they had thrashed out terms with the La Liga side, who have upped their asking price and are now demanding around £20million for the 21-year-old.

That means Rodgers could turn his attention to Swiss international Rodriguez instead.

The Reds were linked with the 21-year-old in January, but could reignite their interest if a deal for Moreno falls through.

The potential signing of Xherdan Shaqiri is sure to excite Liverpool fans, with the midfield maestro long considered one of the brightest prospects to come out of Swiss football.

At just 22-years-old, Shaqiri is already a key figure in the national side and played the full 90 minutes in Switzerland’s 2-1 opening match victory over Ecuador in the World Cup.

Shaqiri burst on the scene as a teenager after making his debut for Basle in 2009, where he quickly cemented his place in the starting line-up over the next three seasons.

To the delight of Reds fans he already has pedigree when it comes to sticking the knife into rivals Manchester United.

The Swiss star provided two assists for Basle in a 2-1 victory over Manchester United in 2011 which helped dump the Red Devils out of the Champions League group stage.

His performances soon caught the eye of a number of European clubs, but it was Bayern Munich which won the race to sign him in the summer of 2012.

Despite his promising talent, Shaqiri has struggled to break into an all-conquering Bayern Munich side that have eased to the German title for the past two seasons, as well as the Champions League  crown  in 2013.

Due to a lack of consistent playing time, the German side haven’t got the best out of Shaqiri who is sure to rediscover his excellent potential with an opportunity of first-team football.

Nicknamed the ‘Alpine Messi’ Shaqiri made his international debut at just 18-years-old, scoring his first international goal shortly after in a 2-1 Euro 2012 qualifying defeat by England.

Shaqiri’s not going to win many headers standing at just 1.69m, but his weight of 70kg helps provide a low centre of gravity which can make him difficult to shrug off the ball.

Adept at using both feet and possessing excellent vision, Shaqiri can play anywhere across the attacking areas of midfield and would add talent and depth to a Liverpool side back in Europe this term.
