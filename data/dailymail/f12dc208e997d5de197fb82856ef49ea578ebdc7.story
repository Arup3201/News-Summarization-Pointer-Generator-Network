A California teenager was forced to crash into a car on the freeway so she could escape from an Army veteran accused of holding her hostage after she tried to help him.

Daniela Alvarez was allegedly approached by Kenneth Middlebrook in the drive of her San Jose home on Sunday, and asked if she could drive him home.

But the 23-year-old, who served in Iraq, is accused of suddenly snapping and threatening to choke the teenager, before forcing her to drive.

Ordeal: Daniela Alvarez, 19, was kidnapped by an army veteran she had offered to help

Daniela said she was terrified for her life and was forced to crash the car into another vehicle on a freeway so she could try to get help.

Arrested: Kenneth Middlebrook is facing two kidnapping charges

The 19-year-old said Middlebrook had seemed normal when he stopped her outside his home, and asked for help because he was stranded.

She told CBS she believed his story and agreed to get in his car because he seemed so normal but, after arriving at a house that Middlebrook claimed belonged to his father, he suddenly snapped.

'When he came out of the house he was very agitated. Very upset,' Sergeant Saul Jaeger told KTVU.

'it was at this point that she felt like she was not free to leave.'

Daniela described how he grabbed hold of her and tried to choke her, before demanding that she get in the trunk of the vehicle.

The brave teenager refused and tried to calm Middlebrook, offering to continue driving as she tried to think of way to escape.

Her mother, Nellie Figueroa, said: 'He wanted to get her in the trunk but she refused ... and thanks to God she's alive.'

When the pair reached a freeway, Daniela smashed into another car before braking hard and running out of the car.

Trauma: Army veteran Middlebrook is said to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder

'I remember screaming to this guy, "Help me, help me, help me, this guy is trying to kill me",' she said.

Middlebrook fled from the scene, as the unidentified motorist who stopped to help, comforted Daniela and called police.

The army veteran went on to kidnap a 61-year-old woman. who was forced from her home and made to drive around San Francisco for several hours before she managed to escape.

'She was afraid for her life,' Sergeant Jaeger said, adding that the woman, who has not been identified, managed to drive off and escape after Middlebrook got out of the car and ordered her to wait.

The police have said there is a possibility of other victims who may not have come forward yet.

Middlebrook was arrested on Monday and charged with two counts of kidnapping, two counts of robbery and one count of battery.

His father, Jeffrey Middlebrook, said he had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder since serving in Iraq in the Army.

He had been having problems since returning from Iraq, where he was haunted after having to pull the decapitated bodies of three friends from a burning vehicle.

'I don't want anyone to think there is any justification for what he allegedly did,' Mr Middlebrook told the San Jose Mercury News.Â 

'But the other side of the story. My son went to war. He left a good, happy, loving kid and he came back a devastated human being.'

Since leaving the army in 2012, Middlebrook had been involved in minor criminal behavior, but each time he was released, his father said.

Neither woman was physically hurt during their terrifying ordeals, but Daniela says she has been left traumatized by the events.
