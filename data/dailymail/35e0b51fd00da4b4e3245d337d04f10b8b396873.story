Luis Suarez could not help his Uruguay teammates avoid defeat to Colombia on the pitch but the striker's presence was still felt in the changing room and the stands.

Uruguay hung Suarez's kit and gave him his regular spot, before taking to Twitter to proudly announce his place 'intact' ahead of the 2-0 loss.

And during the game that saw Colombia reach the World Cup quarter-finals, fans donned masks of the Liverpool striker's face, while others wore t-shirts with the words: 'We are all Luis Suarez'.

Uruguay made their bid for the quarter-finals without their talisman forward 
after Suarez was banned for nine international games and four months for
 biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder.

In his explanation to FIFA, Suarez claimed he tried to defend himself, saying he did not deliberately bite Chiellini.

'In no way it happened how you have described, as a bite or intent to bite,' he wrote in a letter to the panel.

'After the impact ... I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent.

'At that moment I hit my face against the player leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth.'

FIFA have been formally informed of an appeal as a result, and the Uruguay football federation have seven days to prepare the paperwork.

FIFA's head of media Delia Fischer, speaking in Rio de Janeiro, said: 'We have received a declaration that they are planning to appeal.

'They informed us of their intention to appeal (on Friday) evening.

'The reasons for the appeal must now be given in writing within a deadline of seven days after the three days have expired.'
