A 65-year-old American woman who lost her home in the credit crunch is leading a class-action suit against 12 of the world's major banks for their part in the financial crisis.

Annie Bell Adams claims banks including Barclays, RBS and Lloyds, manipulated the Libor rates to make mortgage repayments more expensive than they should have been.

The suit alleges the Libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - was artificially changed at times when it would have a big impact on adjustable mortgage rates, 'unjustly enriching' the bankers at the cost of mortgage-holders losing their homes.

Wide-reaching: The class-action suit takes in 12 banks, including some of the biggest names in Wall Street, as well as banks based in Britain

London's financial district: Banks from across the world, including Barclays and HSBC, have been named in the suit, which was filed in New York

The class action lawsuit, originating in Alabama, alleges the rate-fixing meant homeowners paid thousands more than necessary between 2000 and 2009 - with the knock-on effect causing many families to lose their homes.

The group of 12 banks also includes UBS, Citigroup, The Bank of America, 
Rabobank International Holdings BV, Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC 
Holdings, Lloyds Banking Group, Deutsche Bank AG and the Royal Bank of 
Canada.

Libor, or the 'London interbank offered 
rate', is seen as the benchmark for more than $300trillion of loans and securities, and is re-calculated on a daily basis, based on groups of lenders estimating their borrowing rates.

But the suit alleges this rate was artificially changed at times when it would have a big impact on adjustable mortgage rates.

This allowed them to increase the payments by homeowners on adjustable rate loans, boosting profit, according to the lawsuit.

What is Libor?

It is the London Inter-Bank Offered 
Rate - the rate at which international banks lend to each other. It is 
calculated every business day in 10 currencies and 15 timespans, ranging
from overnight to one year and is based on the level at which banks 
have been lending to each other.

When is it set?

It is set and announced at around 
11am to midday for the UK rate, based on borrowing from the previous 
day. Operating since the mid-1980s, in the years before the credit 
crunch it sat marginally higher than the central bank rate.

Why is it important?

The sterling three-month LIBOR rate 
influences the level at which lenders set some rates on loans, 
especially mortgages, to consumers and to businesses. It also impacts on
the amount they will lend.

It is the rate at which banks lend 
to each other and is therefore a measure of how much they trust each 
other and a measure of the credit crunch. There tends to be a lag from 
when LIBOR changes to when bank lending rates are altered.

Also, some new mortgage deals have 
been linked to LIBOR rather than bank rate or a lender's SVR. That's 
because it is more closely linked to a lenders' costs.

What would LIBOR be in 'normal' conditions?

The three-month LIBOR rate should be
just 10 or 20 basis points higher than the bank rate if conditions went
back to how they were in the first half of this decade.

So under pre-credit crunch conditions, if the bank rate or base rate is 2%, LIBOR should be 2.1% or 2.2%

But it soared far higher in August 
2007, marking the start of the credit crunch. It recovered over the 
summer of 2008 (see the figures above) as some trust returned but then 
spiked on the collapse of Lehman Brothers (15/16 Sept 2008).

Barclays Plc, Britainâ€™s 
second-biggest lender by assets, is the only bank to have settled with 
regulators over the rigging of Libor.

It
is the first class-action lawsuit filed by home owners, according to 
the Financial Times, which said other class-action suits have been 
brought by investors and municipalities.

Annie Bell Adams's sub-prime mortgage was securitised into 
Libor-based collateralised debt obligations and sold on by banks to 
investors.

The plaintiffs, 
who have lost thousands of dollars each, could number 100,000, their 
Alabama-based attorney John Sharbrough said.

There
are at least 900,000 homes in the UK with loans linked to Libor, with 
an unpaid principle balance of more than $275billion.

Sharborough declined to give a figure on the total damages his clients are seeking.

Under fire: Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays are both named in the suit

The lawsuit claims that increasing Libor allowed banks 'to raise the interest rates paid by the plaintiffs on their adjustable-rate notes'

It says that many adjustable-rate mortgages had the first day of the month as a 'change date' on which new repayment rates would reset, it adds.

The FT adds that the lawsuit claims, upon statistical analysis, that Libor rose consistently on the first day of each month between 2000 and 2009.

It claims that, between 2007 and 2009, Libor moved as much as 7.5 basis points for certain certain reset days.

Faith in the Libor interest rate system, which underpins more than $300 trillion of contracts and loans from US mortgages to Japanese interest-rate swaps, plummeted after Barclays was fined in June for rigging it.

Other banks are under investigation.
