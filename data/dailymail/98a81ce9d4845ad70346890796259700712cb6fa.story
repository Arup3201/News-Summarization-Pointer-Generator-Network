Pep Guardiola has been tasked with taking the Ice Bucket Challenge by Portland Timbers manager Caleb Porter who poked fun at the Bayern Munich boss.

The former Barcelona manager refused to shake hands with Porter following his side's 2-1 defeat to the MLS All Stars on Wednesday having been angered with some of the challenges on his players.

Taking part to raise awareness of ALS (Amytrophic lateral sclerosis), Porter's breath was clearly taken away as the ice bucket was poured over him.

Porter then thanked ESPN's Taylor Twellman for the challenge and in turn challenged Guardiola to take part before imitating a handshake.

It remains to be seen whether the former Spain international will take the challenge while US manager Jurgen Klinsman was also asked to take part.

Despite Porter mocking the Spaniard, US soccer president Sunil Galati confirmed that the pair did in fact shake hands following the game and tweeted: 'All good with Pep Guardiola and Caleb Porter. With them for nice handshake outside the locker room after the game.'

Goals from Bradley Wright-Phillips and American legend Landon Donovan gave the All Stars victory after new signing Robert Lewandowski had given Bayern Munich the lead.
