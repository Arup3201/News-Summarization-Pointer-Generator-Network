A young American ballet star has become the first foreign dancer to become a 'premier' with the famed Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow.

David Hallberg, who will also remain a principal with the New York-based American Ballet Theatre, received the distinction earlier this year.

Until now, foreign dancers were only invited for guest stints and traditionally it has been stars from Moscow who move to the U.S.

So harsh was the political climate, even those dancers that fled the Soviet Union were said to have faced death warrants ordered by the KGB.

Stunning moves: David Hallberg leaps across the stage during the American Ballet Theatre's production of The Bright Stream. The 29-year-old has won a place at the prestigious Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow

But in an interview, Hallberg, from South Dakota, made it clear he fully grasps the significance of his move.

'It's a milestone,' the 29-year-old said by telephone during a break in rehearsals for an upcoming tour.

'It's historic. It's a huge challenge, but I feel it's important, not just for me as an artist, but for the dance world - and, in the bigger picture, maybe even for international relations.'

Historically, some of the finest dancers from eastern Europe have moved to the U.S.

Rudolf
Nureyev defected to the West in 1961 and Mikhail Baryshnikov in 1974 - 
both great dancers who fled the Soviet Union for freedom and better 
opportunities.

The leader of the Societ Union, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, attempted to keep Nureyev in the country and a KGB death warrant is said to have been ordered for him.

But Hallberg's reverse move shows how much the world has changed.

Hallberg, at 29, is already regarded as one of the most talented male ballet dancers in the world.

In six years as a principal with ABT, he has captivated audiences with his pure, elegant form, weightless jumps, regal bearing and tall, blond good looks.

He performs in modern as well as classical pieces, but is especially suited to princely roles such as Siegfried in Swan Lake, Albrecht in Giselle or Romeo.

First approached by the Bolshoi in April,
while performing in Moscow, Hallberg said his decision took time and 
was extremely difficult.

'It was really hard because the responsibility is really great; there's a responsibility to really do this justice,' he said.

'I by no means want to compare this to the weight of the defections of Misha (Baryshnikov) and Nureyev. I wasn't even around yet. I can't imagine what it was like for them.'

But, he added: 'There is a correlation. This is about the globalisation of the world, and the globalisation of dance in particular.'

Hallberg said he will split his time between the two companies, living both in New York and in Moscow.

In a statement, the Bolshoi hailed its newest 'premier', or principal.

'Mr Hallberg ... possesses all the best qualities of classical dancer - perfect technique, refined manners and outstanding acting abilities,' said artistic director Sergei Fillin.

Hallberg's first appearance with the Bolshoi is expected to be Giselle, with the young Bolshoi sensation Natalia Osipova as his partner.

The two won raves when they performed the ballet together at the New York based ABT.

'We have a special connection,' Hallberg added.
