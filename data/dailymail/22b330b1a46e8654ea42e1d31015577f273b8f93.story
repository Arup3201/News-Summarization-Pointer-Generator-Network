It is now hailed as a stone-cold 80s classic and one of the highlights of the New Romantic era, but Ultravox's his Vienna has only just reached the top of the charts after being named the nation's favourite number two single.

The song, featuring its moody dry-ice filled black and white video, was originally kept off the top spot by novelty track Shaddap You Face by the US-born Australian Joe Dolce.

But the song, released in January 1981, has now triumphed in a national poll by Radio 2 and the Official Charts Company to find the greatest track to narrowly miss out on the top slot.

Top of the pops: Vienna, by Ultravox, has been named as the all time best single which narrowly missed out on the top spot when initially released

Missed out: The single has become a classic after being beaten to the number one spot by Shaadap You Face by Joe Dolce

Ultravox frontman Midge Ure said: 'We are extremely pleased and very humbled to have been given this honorary number one, especially knowing the outstanding records which were also in the running - Strawberry Fields, Hound Dog and Wonderwall to name just a few.

'A huge thanks to everyone who took the time and effort to vote for Vienna. It has restored our faith in the idea that the public will always recognise the good in music, and that this song has proved this.'

The Ultravox song's triumph left The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl single Fairytale Of New York as the all-time number two number two.

The 1987 Christmas hit was originally held in check by the Pet Shop Boys cover of Elvis Presley's hit Always On My Mind.

Both songs will feature in a countdown of the best number twos of all time to be broadcast from 2pm today, featuring the top 40 songs which were a whisker away from the top in their own right.

The poll was launched to celebrate 60 years of the singles chart. DJ Tony Blackburn will list the songs in his three-hour show The Nation's Favourite Number Two Single.

Winners: Ultravox beat the likes of The Beatles, The Kinks and Queen to claim top spot in the poll

Pleased: Ultravox singer Midge Ure has said the band has been humbled after coming out top in the poll

He was among a panel of experts - including Radio 2's Ken Bruce and Janice Long, Radio 1's Annie Nightingale, Official Charts Company managing director Martin Talbot and 6 Music's Steve Lamacq - who compiled a shortlist from 941 singles which have made it to number two.Radio 2 listeners then voted.

Jeff Smith, Radio 2's head of music, said: 'Vienna is a brilliant track; a true classic.

'It was up against hits by some of the world's biggest acts - We Are The Champions by Queen, Rocket Man by Elton John and Rolling In The Deep by Adele.

'The countdown is packed with some amazing songs.'

Second best: Fairytale of New York was yet again only named number two in the poll, after originally being beaten in the charts by the pet Shop Boys

Mr Talbot said: 'Ultravox's Vienna has beaten off some truly great, classic tracks to claim the title of the UK public's favourite number two single - including Fairytale Of New York, Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields, My Generation, Waterloo Sunset and many more.

'It is also probably the most apt winner, given the fact that it was kept from the chart summit in 1981 by Joe Dolce's Shaddap You Face, which has long been considered one of the biggest chart injustices of all time.'

The Who's My Generation was 12th in the list, Wonderwall by Oasis finished at 13, Rolling In The Deep was at 34 and Rocket Man was at 37.
