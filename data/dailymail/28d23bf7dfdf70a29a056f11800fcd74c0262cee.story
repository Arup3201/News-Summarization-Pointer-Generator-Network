Angry David Cameron has accused Ed Miliband of resorting to childish taunts about his posh background – as he described Labour as 'a complete shower'.

The Prime Minister said Mr Miliband's 'personal abuse' did not bother him and insisted he was 'proud' of his privileged background.

At last week's Labour conference, Mr Miliband accused the PM of being a 'PR man' for the rich. He said Mr Cameron only stood up for 'Conservative supporting, gold mining, luxury hotel owning, Putin award winning, Russian oligarchs'.

But Mr Cameron said: 'There is quite an interesting difference - my argument about Ed Miliband is that he has not got a plan. That is substance. As far as I can see from his speech, he just had personal abuse. Well after nine years of being party leader, I can cope with personal abuse. It doesn't seem very grown-up.'

David Cameron, at the Tory conference in Birmingham, told party supporters that Labour were a 'complete shower' 

Mr Cameron made clear the next election would be a direct choice between him and Ed Miliband

Mr Cameron, who was in the conference hall to watch George Osborne's speech, insisted he did not live a 'totally rarefied existence'

He added: 'But at the end of the day, the election will be decided upon who has got the best plan, who is going to take the country forward. It is not about where I went to school.'

Mr Cameron, 47, speaking to the Sun newspaper insisted he did not live a 'totally rarefied existence' – but said he was not going to pretend he was not posh.

He said: 'You can't change who you are, and I am not going to change who I am.

'I can't change the school I went to, or the upbringing I had, or the parents I have - and nor would I want to.'

Mr Cameron's anger with the Labour Party came to the surface at a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham last night.

The PM, speaking to party activists, said the Labour Party was so poor it would be embarrassing not to beat them in May's general election.

He said: 'We saw last week what we are up against, and I have to say, after that Labour leader's speech, after that Labour conference, if we, the Conservative Party, cannot defeat that complete shower of an opposition we don't deserve to be in politics.'

The remarks echo Tony Blair's final conference speech as Labour leader, in which he said of the Tories: 'If we can't take this lot apart in the next few years we shouldn't be in the business of politics at all.'

Ed Miliband's tried a similar tactic in his 2012 conference address, in which he asked: 'Have you ever seen a more incompetent, hopeless, out-of-touch, U-turning, pledge-breaking, make-it-up-as-you-go-along, back-of-the-envelope, miserable shower than this Prime Minister and this government?'

Mr Cameron said 'personal insults' about his background did not bother him. But the Tory Party has targeted Ed Miliband as Labour's weak link

Labour leader Ed Miliband resorted to digs about Mr Cameron's background because he didn't have a 'plan' for the economy, Mr Cameron said

In his interview with the Sun, Mr Cameron said there were bits about him voters 'absolutely hate', but insisted not everyone was against him.

He said: 'I think people have got to know me a bit. 'I am sure there are bits they like, bits they don't like.'

But hae added: 'When I go round the country, you obviously get some good reactions you get some bad reactions.

'But generally people have a sense that the government is trying to do something, trying to sort things out.'

He added: 'A lot of people shout 'Stick at it.' That is probably what I hear more than anything else.'
