Craig Dutton, 21, received two more years in jail after calling officers from his prison cell, asking whether he would be charged with drugs possession

A prisoner has been handed two more years in jail after he phoned police from his cell to ask whether they had forgotten about the cocaine he was carrying when he was arrested.

'Honest' Craig Dutton, 21, called officers from a young offenders’ institution to find out if he was going to be charged with possessing class A drugs after not hearing from them.

He was four months into an 18-month sentence after taking police on a high-speed chase in a stolen BMW.

When he was arrested in December, after crashing into a taxi, police found 16.2 grams crack cocaine in his possession.

Dutton was jailed on Christmas Eve for aggravated vehicle taking without consent, driving while disqualified and without insurance.

Now he has landed himself two more years behind bars after being brought back to Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to possession of a Class A drug.

Police officers said they were awaiting test results on the drugs before deciding whether to bring extra charges when Dutton rang them from HMYOI Brinsford.

Prosecutor Heather Chamberlain told the court Dutton was in debt to a dealer and feared he would be beaten up if he did not hold the drugs for him.

She said: 'He was prosecuted for a driving offence and it was while he was in custody for that offence that he contacted police and said, "What’s happening about these drugs?" and asked to be interviewed.

'He was interviewed while in custody. He said he had a phone call to pick the drugs up and was to keep them until the dealer wanted them.

'He knew it was cocaine. He said he is not a user himself but was in debt to the dealer for £100 so he owed him and did that job for him.'

The court heard Dutton has 18 previous convictions for 32 offences. He has now been transferred to an adult jail for the first time.

Dutton’s latest crime comes five 
years after he took part in a pilot police boxing scheme aimed at 
getting young troublemakers off the streets.

Stuart
 Muldoon, mitigating, said: 'Although he has previous convictions, there
 are none for drugs. He’s still young. Going to HMP Dovegate will be his
 first experience of an adult prison.'

Sentencing
 him two years to run consecutively with his earlier sentence, Judge 
Paul Glenn said: 'You are still only 21 and have been in quite a lot of 
trouble from the age of 12 but nothing previously relating to drugs.

Transfer: Dutton will be moved from the young offenders' institution to Category B prison HMP Dovegate

'On December 24 I sentenced you on other matters. Those offences were committed on the same day as this one.

'Police found drugs when you were arrested. They are valued in the region of £1,200 and you told police in interview you were holding the drugs for someone else who you knew to be a dealer.

'Crack cocaine is highly addictive and those connected in the supply expect significant sentences and you knew you were associating with someone who was actively drug dealing.'

A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'This was a possession with intent to supply class A drug offence.

'We require forensic evidence from the lab to identify the drugs and establish exactly what they are.

'We then need police drugs experts to give a street value and that means it can take time to bring the charges.'
