Two U.S. Senators put aside their political differences in August and spent a week together on a deserted island with no fresh water last month for a reality TV show that will air on the Discovery Channel in October.

The one-episode series called Rival Survival will feature Arizona Republican Jeff Flake and New Mexico Democrat Martin Heinrich marooned in the Marshall Islands for six days and six nights.

The purpose of the dramatic week-long getaway, the senators said in a statement, was to prove that bipartisanship isn't dead.

Sens. Jeff Flake, left, and Martin Heinrich, right, attempt to start a fire while surviving on the remote Eru island, part of the Marshall Islands, for the Discovery Channel's Rival Survival. The two U.S. senators from opposite sides of the political aisle spent a week marooned together on a remote island for the new reality show

'Both of us know just how frustrated people are with Washington right now. We can both attest that no one is more frustrated than those of us trying to get things done in this environment,' they said.

'So we decided to do something completely out of the ordinary and frankly a little extreme to show the world and our colleagues that even if you have serious differences, if you want to survive you have to work together.'

The two freshman senators secretly filmed the adventure on the island of Eru while Congress was in recess last month.

Flake, who is an experienced survivalist, told the Washington Post on Thursday that he and Heinrich had originally planned to shoot the documentary themselves and have someone else produce it for them.

'Then we approached Discovery because they have a number of survivor shows and they said, well, we like the idea but how about you let us come film it?' Flake said.

A description of the show released by Discovery says that the 'unusual pairing will leave behind the daily life of congressional staff, senate hearings and committee meetings to navigate the rigors of surviving on an isolated island with no contact with the outside world to call upon for help. 

Sen. Jeff Flake has marooned himself in the Marshall Islands twice before in 2009 and and 2013. The second time he took his teenage sons, Tanner, left, and Dallin, right, with him at their urging

'Using only these limited resources and their wits' the unlikely allies must work together 'to spear fish, build shelter and find enough water to survive for one week.'

'There is no natural source for fresh water on Eru, and what lives in the ocean will be their major food source,' the statement says. 

While the Survivor-style show is an oddity, Flake is no amateur at playing house on a deserted island, having stranded himself in the Marshall Islands on two other occasions in the last five years.

In August of 2009, when he was still serving in the House of Representatives, Flake spent a week alone on the island of Jabonwod.

Excerpts of a diary the congressman kept during his time on the island revealed that the Senator had been dreaming of being a castaway since he was a child.

'I have the best job in the world, but still the islands beckon,' he said in a section printed in the Washington Post.

'No food, just mask, fins and a pole-spear to obtain it. No water, only a manual desalination pump to create fresh water,' Flake wrote.

'No matches, only a magnifying glass. And a hammock, knife, hatchet, sunscreen, cooking pot and salt and pepper. Oh, and a satellite phone and Coast Guard beacon should I eat the wrong fish and a Sharpie pen to scrawl a desperate message for rescuers.'

Flake again snuck off to the string of islands in the Pacific Ocean last year over Memorial Day weekend - that time at the behest of his two teenage sons, Tanner and Dallin, who he'd promised to take on a their own after his Senate campaign concluded.

The trio spent the holiday weekend on the island of Biggarenn together.

'We came back a little thinner. Maybe a little wiser. We had an awesome time, it was great,' Flake told the Post after that trip.

'For a dad it was a wonderful thing. No video games around, no television, no distractions, no texting,' Flake said.'To just sit there and pump water, that was my favorite time, frankly, on the island. Just talking. Just to have no distractions.'

Flake and his sons filmed the experience and released a video of their travels afterward. 

For his third trip, Flake took a friend from across the aisle and an experienced camera crew to catch it all on camera.

Rival Survival will air on the Discovery Channel on October 29 at 10 pm, six days before the mid-term elections.

'Whoever is going to lead the Senate going forward is going to do so with a very slim margin,' Flake told the Post. 'The parties are going to need to work together, so we wanted to get this out before the election, now’s a good time to show it.'
