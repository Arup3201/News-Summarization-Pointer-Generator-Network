In the fight against obesity, counting up the calories in every chip, biscuit or stick of celery can be a faff too far.

However, a US company claims to have developed a smart wristband that does the adding up for you - by measuring changes in the glucose levels and liquid in the skin cells.

The HealBe GoBe wristband is the latest twist in the wearable technology revolution, most of which is built on a theme of improving health.

It was designed by a team of Russian-based developers and product managers led by Artem Shipitsyn and George Mikaberydze. 

The wristband uses an algorithm that analyses data collected by three sensors.

These sensors monitor changes in the body through the skin as people go through their day, walking, eating, sitting and sleeping.

There is a pulse sensor which measures blood flow and heart rate, plus an accelerometer which measures body movement and activity, such as the number of steps taken.

The third is called a bioimpedance sensor, which the company claims can give a good measure calorie intake.

The theory is that when people eat, carbohydrates are turned into glucose or sugar in their blood.

Cells absorb the glucose and use it for energy, displacing liquid in the process.

The bioimpedance sensor measures this change using patented software to translate this into the number of calories consumed, which are shown on the band’s screen.

As well as coming up with a figure for calorie intake, the other information collected by the sensors gives a total for calories burned, which allows the wearer to see whether they have done enough to lose weight during the day.

The information on the pulse is used to deliver a stress level measure, while the device can also measure whether you have slept soundly or been tossing and turning through the night.

While the theory sounds remarkable and useful, there are questions about whether there is sound science to back up the calorie count claims. 

The device initially launched on Indiegogo, and raised more than $1 million dollars - 10 times its target.

Following the launch of the campaign, doctors and nutritionists disputed the claims made by Mr Shipitsyn, saying that even if the sensors could accurately measure the energy changes, it wouldn't be a reliable guide to calorie intake. 

At this week's Consumer Electronics Show, BBC reporter Leo Kelion was given the opportunity to test the company's claims.

During the test, Mr Kelion ate half a cheese and turkey sandwich (125 calories), a small Snickers chocolate bar (220 calories), and drank a bottle of apple juice (210 calories), giving a total of 555.

The wristband started adding up the calories after 15 minutes and following an experiment lasting two and half hours, it came up with a figure of 515 calories.

The US manufacturer, HealBe, said the science behind the wristband has been verified by studies.

An independent report, published in September, gave an accuracy rating of 84 per cent to 93 per cent - but only involved five volunteers.   

If that error margin is correct, the wristband, which will go on sale through the company’s website later this year with a $299.99 (£196 plus international postage), may be of limited use for calorie counting.
