If you see a $100 bill on your windshield, it might not be an early Christmas present, authorities have warned.

In fact, it could be a scam encouraging you to get out of your car to grab the bill - before lurking thieves jump into your running vehicle and speed off.

Although the Maryland Assistant Attorney General said she has not seen such a scam in a police report, a resident informed her of one incident during a public information safety session, she said.

'But because it's something of a frightening nature, if this happens to someone, we hope they will take the proper precautions,' Karen Straughn told ABC News.

Beware: Authorities have warned of a holiday scam where someone sees a $100 on their windshield and gets out of their car to retrieve it. Waiting thieves then jump in the car and take off

She added that there is also the added danger of children being in the car if this scam occurs. 

The Baltimore County Police Department's auto theft task force added that while it has not seen the $100 bill scam yet, they have noticed similar ploys.

'We have seen incidents where auto thieves will bump the back of someone's car in traffic,' a spokesman said. 'When everyone gets out of their cars, a thief will jump in the victim's car and drive off.'

And those aren't the only scams that authorities are warning drivers about this holiday season. 

Among them, Straughn warned that scammers will approach a motorist and ask if they can prepare small dents in their car for a set amount, such as $200.

But after the job is finished, the motorist might drive away and find they did a bad job or the scammer might actually demand a much higher sum.

Warning: Announcing Maryland's new consumer protection office, state Assistant Attorney General Karen Straughn said motorists should be aware of scammers working in parking lots over the holiday period

In one incident, a scammer actually drove the motorist to the bank so they could get out the money, Straughn said. But that offender was reported and caught.

'Don't just accept business or items from people who approach you in a parking lot who want to sell you something,' she said. 'You should check out a business before you decide to pay them money.'

Another scam reported in Baltimore County  involved a suspect yelling for help in a mall parking lot and when someone approached to give them help, the suspect tried to grab them. 

'During the holiday season, the scams ratchet up tremendously,' Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler told WTOP.

The state has now opened a new consumer protection office in Prince George's County, where people can report scams and learn hot to avoid them. 

'Having this office here and available to help people navigate getting some of their money back, or all of their money back, is going to be a great thing for the people of Prince George's and Montgomery counties,' Gansler said.
