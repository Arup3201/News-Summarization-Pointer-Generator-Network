A 15-year-old girl has been caught driving her drunk father home, after police noticed the man was not wearing a seatbelt. 

The pair were pulled over in the Darwin suburb of Winnellie on Friday, where officers learnt that the drunk father forced his daughter to drive him home. 

The teenager and her intoxicated father were on their way to Humpty Doo, 40 kilometres from Darwin city. 

A 15-year-old girl has been caught driving her drunk father home, after police noticed the man was not wearing a seatbelt 

Superintendent Rob Burgoyne has condemned the father's actions. 

'Getting an underage person to drive is obviously not the way to go,' he said. 

'No matter what the situation is and how much experience the young person has it's just not something that you should put someone that young under pressure to do.' 

Northern Territory Police said the 15-year-old is expected to face court.

The incident has prompted Superintendent Burgoyne to remind drivers to be safe over the Christmas period, the ABC reports. 

'With the festive season coming up it's something that should be put right out of the mind,' he said. 

'If they are a bit over the limit they should either get a sober driver or get a taxi or some form of other transport.'
