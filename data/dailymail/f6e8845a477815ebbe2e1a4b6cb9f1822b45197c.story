They say that a cat always lands on its feet. But these kitties are surely risking one of their nine lives in a hilarious skydving stunt to promote an insurance firm.

While it may look like these fearless furry felines are freefalling thousands of feet, animal lovers can rest assured that no animals were harmed in the making of the advert.

Despite its convincing appearance, it has emerged that the commercial was produced using green screen technology.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Flying cats: The video opens with the furry animals freefalling through the sky over what is presumably Sweden

Unflustered: The cats look relatively unscathed as they fall with squinted eyes and the wind blowing through their fur

Convincing: Although green screen technology was used to create the hilarious footage, many viewers were fooled into thinking that the cats actually took part in a real skydive

Don't look down: An aerial shot shows just how high up the cats appear to be

The advert is for customer owned Swedish insurance company Folksam in honour of one of its customers, Eva Leijonmark, who has her beloved cat covered by the firm.

The company had asked its customers for advertising ideas, but probably didn't bargain on Eva's wacky concept.

The video shows the cats appearing to freefall with squinted eyes and the wind rushing through their fur.

The group then join up in formation linking paws in an adorable attempt to spell out the word Eva across the sky.

Set to R Kelly's 1996 hit I Believe I Can Fly, the ad then shows the moggies parachutes opening as they begin the slow descent back down to earth.

Produced by advertising agency Akestam.holst, the 40 second video has gone viral with almost 500,000 hits on YouTube.

Formation: The cats begin to move closer as they attempt to spell out a word across the sky

Linking up: As the kitties get closer on their freefall they look to hold on to one another

Cute: The moggies hold paws as they move into formation

While most viewers appear to see the funny side of the clip, some seem to be fooled into thinking that the cats involved were actually thrown from a plane.

The company has said that it followed animal welfare laws to ensure that the animals were unhurt in during the filming.

It is one of Sweden's oldest insurance firms and the advert is, of course, designed to promote its pet insurance policies.

Impressive: The cats spell out the word Eva in honour of the customer who came up with the idea for the advert

Fearless: The cats break formation and begin to freefall to earth again against a back drop of a bright sun

Floating to earth: The advert ends with the cats opening their parachutes and beginning a safe descent to the ground
