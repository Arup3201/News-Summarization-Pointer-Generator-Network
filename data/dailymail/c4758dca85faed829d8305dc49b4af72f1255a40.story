Liverpool's stadium announcer was forced to plead with fans at Anfield to stop using a whistle during their clash with Arsenal on Sunday.

The demand came just four days after their clash at Bournemouth ended in controversy when the Championship team’s captain Tommy Elphick stopped in his tracks when he heard a whistle from the crowd.

Elphick was closing down Philippe Coutinho before stopping and raising his hand, believing referee Mark Clattenburg had blown his whistle.

After the incident, it emerged that the whistle was blown by a supporter, rather than the man in the middle Clattenburg. 

On Sunday, fourth official Chris Pawson asked for the request at half-time, just moments after Matheiu Debuchy had equalised, at Anfield after a referee’s whistle was heard in the crowd.

Using a whistle is against stadium regulations and can result in a ban, but it was unclear which part of the stadium the whistle was heard from.
