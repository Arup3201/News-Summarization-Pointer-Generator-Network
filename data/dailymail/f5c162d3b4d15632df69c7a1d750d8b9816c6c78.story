Louis van Gaal must address Manchester United’s defensive lack of ‘control’ if they are to challenge rivals City and Chelsea for the Premier League, admits Gary Neville.

The former right back believes the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic have had a profound impact on the Reds, claiming they are without a calming influence at the back.

David Moyes endured chronic problems last season, with Van Gaal still struggling to hit on the sort of formula Sir Alex Ferguson cracked for years.

And that is what sets Chelsea apart from United, argues Neville.

‘What I always think you want in defenders is control and composure,’ he told Stretty News. ‘They know where they are meant to be and are not always diving around on their backside. Ferdinand and Vidic is [Steve] Burce and [Gary] Pallister. It’s as good as it gets in football.

‘They are always in the right positions and they always clear the ball out of the box. I don’t mean always as they’ve all made mistakes but there’s a composure and understanding there that in the big moments of a match they are not going to be flapping. Instead they control and settle everybody around them.’

Neville himself is aware of what it takes to be a leader, having captained Manchester United in the past

Jose Mourinho has seen his league leaders concede just 15 goals, and Neville puts that down in no small part to their captain.

‘John Terry does that at Chelsea you’ve got to admit. He brings a level of real control to the defence. When I look at the United defence what it lacks is control.

‘I see players that have talent but they’re all individually working, not having controlled movements together of in-sync. That comes through understanding and from playing together.’

Neville went on to praise calming influence of Michael Carrick, labelling him Manchester United's midfield 'piano'.

The Reds have improved from the days of Moyes since the arrival of Louis van Gaal in the summer, and Carrick has been an integral part of the team that has taken them to fourth in the Premier League.

In fact, Carrick has played every minute of League football since November 8, bar half an hour against Newcastle on Boxing Day. 

'When you play with Michael Carrick you think there is authority, control, peace,' Neville said. 'When you are on a football pitch playing against Liverpool or Manchester City, you need peace around you as well.

'You sometimes don’t want people running around like blue-arse flies. Scholes and Carrick together was peaceful. It was like going into a bar and hearing a piano playing. It’s relaxing. Listening to some good rock is good and you like that too but sometimes it’s nice to listen to a piano. Carrick’s a piano.'

United's start to Van Gaal's reign was far from desirable, and guess who wasn't present until November? Carrick. Neville thinks that when it comes to the team-sheet, the 33-year-old is one of the first names Van Gaal jots down.

'If you look at Louis van Gaal at the start of the season and we were struggling, ask yourself who wasn’t playing? Michael Carrick wasn’t playing. Now he’s playing and the club went on a great unbeaten run. I think he would be first or second on Louis van Gaal’s team-sheet because he brings control and authority.

'Manchester United fans get it. I wanted Bryan Robson and someone to run through brick walls and coming out with bandages wrapped around his head. That’s what Manchester United fans want.'
