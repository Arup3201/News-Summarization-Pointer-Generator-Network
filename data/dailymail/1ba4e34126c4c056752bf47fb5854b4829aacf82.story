West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has asked Andy Carroll to curb his 'fearless' approach as the England striker hopes to return from long-term injury on Saturday.

The 25-year-old could be on the bench for the home tie with Aston Villa and see what would be his first competitive action since injuring ankle ligaments on a pre-season tour of New Zealand.

Allardyce said: 'Maybe Andy could think about modifying his game a touch. He is so brave and I fear some of the injuries come from that.

'Sometimes he goes into areas with no fear and that can be a bit dangerous in terms of injuries.

'He is a whole-hearted, committed player. I cannot tell him to pull out of challenges. But with experience, you know what you can win and what you definitely can't. 

'And that might steer him clear of an injury or two.'

Sam Allardyce admits Carroll may have to do adapt his 'fearless' approach to the game 

Carroll has recently become engaged to former The Only Way Is Essex star Billi Mucklow

Finally deciding to settle down off the pitch can only help Carroll's mindset when he is fully fit and returns to the West Ham attack, according to Allardyce.

The Irons boss believes Carroll is now ready to put his well-documented off-field problems firmly behind him, having recently become engaged to former The Only Way Is Essex star Billi Mucklow.

'Andy has now got a different life. He is not a single man in London and has now got his fiancee,' said Allardyce, who encouraged Carroll's gym sessions with his then girlfriend during rehabiliation from an injury sustained on a pre-season tour of New Zealand.

'The romance has blossomed to the point where he feels that she feels that they want a long-term relationship, and I always think that can be very good for a footballer when they settle down more off the field.

'London can be a very lonely city if you are sat in your apartment on your own every single night - maybe you stay out that little bit too late.

'But when you have a relationship, you start building on that relationship by the fondness you have for each other and I think that can only be good for Andy and his football.'
