The Conservatives have opened up their biggest lead over Labour since 2010 as voters become increasingly optimistic about the economy, according to a new poll.

With four months to go until the General Election, the survey by Lord Ashcroft put the Tories on 34 per cent, six points ahead of Labour on 28 per cent – worse than their result under Gordon Brown.

A regional breakdown suggested that in England, the Conservatives lead Labour by 37 per cent to 29 per cent, while in Scotland the resurgent SNP is on 48 per cent to Labour’s 24 per cent. 

The poll also supported others suggesting that Ukip’s position has been slipping in recent months, putting the party down three points on last month with 16 per cent.

The latest opinion poll from Lord Ashcroft puts the Tories on 34 per cent, ahead of Labour on 28 per cent

The findings were at odds with those of Populus, another pollster, which put Labour five points ahead of the Tories, while a YouGov poll put both on 32 per cent. 

Meanwhile, as David Cameron put the economy at the heart of the Conservative election campaign, 38 per cent of voters said they were either benefiting from recovery or that the recession did not make them any worse off.

There has been an eight-point drop since September in the proportion saying there is no recovery or that they are not feeling the benefits, and a seven-point rise in the total saying they are benefiting or are no worse off.

And in a boost to Conservative hopes of a feel-good factor by the time of May’s election, mortgage rates fell to an all-time low and the price of crude oil crashed below $50 a barrel, its lowest since the financial crisis – signalling more likely cuts in petrol prices and energy bills.

David Cameron used a speech today to set out six Tory election themes, as Labour leader Ed Miliband took questions in Stevenage

Lord Ashcroft said: ‘The success of the Tories’ economic message relies on people feeling that, at the end of the road to a stronger economy, there will be something in it for them.’

Mr Cameron yesterday said an additional £30billion would need be saved before 2018 so this generation does not pass on a ‘legacy of debt’ to its children. 

He was speaking ahead of a vote today on a new ‘fiscal charter’, committing the Government to eliminating the current structural deficit. Labour is expected to back the charter, while rejecting the Government’s timetable.

Labour and the Conservatives may form a ‘grand coalition’ together after the election, a senior Cabinet minister has claimed.

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party should prepare for being pushed out of government, as David Cameron and Ed Miliband could reach an extraordinary deal to share power.

One senior Tory said there was ‘not a snowball’s chance in Hell’ of such an agreement with Labour.

Meanwhile Mr Miliband refused to rule out a Labour coalition with the Scottish National Party.

Chancellor George Osborne said: ‘Labour are in a chaotic position. 

'If they vote for the charter and do accept that £30billion consolidation is required, then they are promising a tax bombshell because they accept our spending plans.

‘If they vote for the charter and reject the need for £30billion consolidation, then they are just pretending they don’t want to borrow or spend more when nothing has actually changed. 

'They would be offering a grand deceit.’

Mr Cameron, who tried his hand at fixing tiles to a roof mockup in during a visit to J Wright roofing college in Nottingham, sought to cast the general election in May as a choice between security and chaos

The Prime Minister said that if the Conservatives remained in power, £12billion in savings would come from fresh welfare cuts, £13billion from a further squeeze on government spending and £5billion from a further crackdown on tax avoidance.

Speaking at a campaign rally in Nottingham, he said the plans were ‘difficult but do-able’ – the equivalent of a family saving £1 in every £100 it spent.

He rejected Labour’s warnings that Tory plans would mean returning public services to 1930s levels – saying spending would only be taken back to the level it was under Tony Blair – and challenged Labour to say where it would raise taxes.

Mr Cameron also sought to counter Labour attacks over the Tories’ failure to make the NHS one of their six main election themes, announcing that the health service budget would be protected from cuts and increased in real terms if he remains in Downing Street.

But Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Unless we have higher wages and living standards, we won’t get the revenue to reduce the deficit. Their plan will keep failing on living standards and therefore keep failing on the deficit.’

Latest polling shows that voters name the economy, health and pensions as the key issues facing them and their family, with immigration a key concern for the country

The Ashcroft poll showed 52 per cent of people say Britain is going in the wrong direction, up three points since May last year.

The figure is highest amongst Ukip voters (76 per cent) and lowest amongst Tory supporters (13 per cent). 

Almost a quarter (23 per cent) say the economy is still not recovering from the recession, while just 14 per cent say the economy is recovering from the recession and they are feeling better off as a result.
