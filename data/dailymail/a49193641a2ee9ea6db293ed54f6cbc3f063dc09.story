She epitomised regal elegance last night in a tiara and jewels. But today Queen Elizabeth opted for a less opulent look as she attended a service at St George's chapel at Windsor Castle.

Her Majesty, 87, wore a pretty paisley print dress under a peach coat. As usual, she showcased her attention to detail when it comes to colour co-ordination wearing a hat that matched the shade of her coat.

She accessorised with her trademark pearls, black handbag and a jewel brooch.

Prince Philip joined his wife at the recital by the Royal College of Organists to commemorate their 150th anniversary.

The evening before, the couple had been dressed up in formal attire as they welcomed President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins and his wife Sabina Coyne to a state banquet in Windsor.

The Queen had worn the spectacular Grand Duchess Vladimir of Russia's tiara and a stunning emerald necklace for the historic occasion.

If the elderly couple had a late night, they showed no signs of it today as they resumed their royal duties.

Music to their ears: The Queen and the Duke said they enjoyed the performance

The Duke of Edinburgh, 92, raised a smile from his wife as they took their seats for the service after being greeted by Dean of Windsor David Conner.

The RCO, of which the Queen is the patron, has more than 2,000 members and is involved in the training and support of church organists across the UK. The recital was held in the castle's gothic 15th century St George's chapel.

The Queen and The Duke visibly enjoyed themselves during the 45-minute long organ recital which included numbers by Bach and Peter Hurford, exchanging smiles throughout.

They were later introduced to the organist, Thomas Trotter.

The Queen told him that he had played 'very well', while the Duke asked about Mr Trotter's forthcoming concerts.

The state banquet was a lavish affair

The Royal party also inspected the chapel's 18th century organ which was commissioned by King George III.

A Buckingham Palace source said: 'I think she's here quite often. She knows the chapel well.'

The afternoon event was attended by more than 200 people, including representatives from the world of organ music and choral recital.

A video screen was even erected to allow the Royal party to observe the organist's footwork.

The president of the Royal College of Organists, Catherine Ennis, said: 'We are very grateful that Her Majesty the Queen, our patron - accompanied by The Duke of Edinburgh, has consented to be present today to crown our anniversary celebrations.

'We hope that we can share our 150th anniversary celebrations with everyone with an interest in organ and choral music, whether through playing the organ, directing or singing in a choir, or through simple enjoyment of the music.'
