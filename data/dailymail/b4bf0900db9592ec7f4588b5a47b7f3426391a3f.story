Cane toads are one of Australia's most invasive pests, and pose a huge threat to native species. But now they could be turned into a successful commodity.

Their venom could be effective in fighting cancer, researchers have discovered, and the potency of Australian cane toad's venom is stronger than those in China.

This means that potentially millions of toads could be shipped to China, so they could have their venom extracted and turned into medicine, to be sold on the multi-billion dollar traditional medicine market.

Millions of Australian cane toads could be shipped to China so their potent venom can be used in cancer medicine

Harendra Parekh, from the University of Queensland's pharmacy department where the research took place, said this discovery could lead to a 'potentially a very lucrative export market'.

'People are killing cane toads by the millions for free, but it’s potentially a very lucrative export market for Australia with the Chinese being extremely interested in naturally derived health products,' Dr Parekh said in an article published by the UOQ.

He added that the Australian cane toad has close similarities to the Asiatic species, 'whose venom has been used in Chinese medicine for thousands of years.'

Cane toads are a pest in Australia, which were introduced in Queensland in 1935 to control cane beetles

'We already have several companies interested, as the Chinese value Australian toads because of the environment they enjoy here,' Dr Parekh said.

The researcher spoke to the Guardian Australia about how the cane toad's venom could be used as a medicine, and said it would most likely appear in a tablet form. 

'We could process the venom for medicine, ideally in a tablet because it tastes absolutely awful if you drink it,' Dr Parekh said. 

New research shows that the pests could be turned into a huge economic commodity 

'Look at lamb, beef and chicken – these Australian products are seen as premium goods in China. Cane toads would be no different. They’d be premium cane toads.'

The can toads would be squeezed for their potent venom which would then be mixed with herbs and turned into medicine. The venom extraction can be done while the toads are alive. 

Cane toads were first introduced to Queensland in 1935, in an attempt to control cane beetles.

However, like rabbits, they quickly multiplied are were deemed a pest. They have since spread to New South Wales, West Australia and the Northern Territory.
