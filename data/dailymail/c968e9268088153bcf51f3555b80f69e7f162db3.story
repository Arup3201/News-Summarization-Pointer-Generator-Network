Sir Alex Ferguson is ‘relishing’ retirement and says he no longer gets ‘worked up’ while watching Manchester United.

The legendary Scot is 18 months into his life after United after ending his Old Trafford reign with his 13th top-flight title at the end of the 2012-2013 campaign.

‘I really am relishing it (retirement),’ he said in an interview with The Big Issue. ‘I can go and watch the team now without getting so worked up.’

David Moyes failed to fill Ferguson’s sizeable shoes and former Holland boss Louis van Gaal has endured an equally-troubling start to his tenure.

The club, rocked by a number of high-profile injuries, are seventh in the Premier League, 13 points adrift of pacesetters Chelsea, and lost to neighbours Manchester City at the start of November, albeit with 10 men after Chris Smalling was sent off.

‘We lost to City but we did OK,’ added Ferguson. 'There was lots of good football. If it had been 11-a-side, who knows?

‘I’m enjoying my football, I’m enjoying my family, my friends and I’m enjoying my retirement. I’m an ambassador for United and I’m on the club’s board of directors so I still watch a lot of games.’   

Meanwhile, Ferguson has revealed that France manager Didier Deschamps ordered his squad to read his autobiography ahead of the World Cup.

Ferguson released his updated book shortly after his retirement. And the 72-year-old has claimed that Deschamps, the former French midfielder, capped 103 times by his country, called on his squad to read it prior to their campaign in Brazil.

‘Patrice Evra phoned me and told me that as part of their preparation for the Brazil World Cup in June, Didier Deschamps made the whole French squad read the book,’ Ferguson said.

‘Evra said it was great as, five minutes after they read it, they’ve never slept better.’

France topped their group but fell to eventual winners Germany at the quarter-final stage.
