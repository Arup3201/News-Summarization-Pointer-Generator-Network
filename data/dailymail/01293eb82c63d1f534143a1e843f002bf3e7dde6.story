BBC Radio 4 and Newsnight host Eddie Mair reveals he's been sober since last summer, deciding to give up booze after 'convivial Saturday lunches' turned into hangovers that could last for days 

The morning after the night before is often harder to bear the older you get – as the BBC’s Eddie Mair will agree.

The Radio 4 and Newsnight host says he has given up alcohol after too many ‘convivial lunches’ which left him suffering for two days afterwards.

The 49-year-old also admitted that the ‘indignity of stumbling on to trains and slurring at taxi drivers’ at his age prompted him to quit alcohol.

Writing in this week’s Radio Times, he revealed he had been sober since last summer and had managed to stay off drink throughout Christmas.

He said: ‘I’d been thinking about stopping for some time. Boozing on a school night had long been abandoned. When I was in my twenties I could knock it back, get a good night’s sleep and be bright as a daisy in the morning.

‘Painful experience in my 40s told me that was no longer best practice. I generally confined alcohol to weekends. Convivial Saturday lunches with like-minded friends (for that read drinking sessions with nibbles) had been a long-established tradition. 

'Even those, however, began to lose their lustre thanks to hangovers lasting through Sunday and sometimes Monday.’

Mr Mair said he had ‘learnt a lot’ by going sober and joked that he had even received a ‘surprise thank you card from my liver’. 

‘Here I am many months later and to my surprise I don’t really miss it much,’ he added.

He admitted he had had a mixed reaction from friends, many of whom doubted he could ‘be having any fun’ without a drink, while others became his ‘best friends for life’ when they realised he could be the designated driver.

In his column, the PM presenter also bemoaned the fact that it was difficult to find non-alcoholic beer and wine in British pubs, in contrast to many bars in Europe.

Mair has previously revealed that he was once so hungover while working on a Sunday morning radio programme that he had to go outside during a pre-recorded section to vomit.

Writing about working in the broadcasting industry in The Guardian in 2002, he said he was always sober and in bed by 10pm before early morning shows except when he was on location when ‘all common sense goes out the window’.

The 49-year-old said many friends doubted he could 'be having any fun' without a drink, while others became his 'best friend for life' when they realised he could be designated driver 

He added: ‘When I was at Five Live, preparing for an early Sunday live transmission from Birmingham, the producers and I went out for a “quick bite to eat” the night before. 

'I vaguely remember being asked to leave the restaurant in the early hours. During a taped segment the next morning I had to go outside to throw up.

‘More recently, BH (Broadcasting House, the Radio 4 Sunday morning programme) from Cardiff was looking good on the Saturday night so we had “some wine” at dinner. 

'I recall sincerely discussing, at 2 o’clock on Sunday morning, whether we shouldn’t all just stay up rather than go to bed. 

'Wisely we did go to bed but had to ask our cabbie at 6am to find us a place that would serve bacon butties and Mars bars.’

Mair joined the BBC in 1987, working for Radio Scotland, and started co-hosting PM in 1998. He has also presented Newsnight on BBC2.
