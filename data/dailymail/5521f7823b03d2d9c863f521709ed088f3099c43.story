Bereaved mother: Tina Wesson, he winner of the 2001 'Survivor', lost her only son, Taylor Collins (pictured), in a car crash last week

The son and brother of 'Survivor' reality TV contestants Tina Wesson and Katie Collins has been killed in a horrific car crash in Tennessee.

Taylor Lee Collins, 25, died December 3 when the car he was riding in went off the road in Chattanooga and rammed into the wall of a garage at 20 South Germantown Road.

Collins, who was sitting in the front, was ejected from the vehicle because he was reportedly not wearing a seat belt.

He was rushed to an area hospital, where he died a short time later from his injuries, Times Free Press reported.

The victim’s mother, Miss Wesson, and sister Katie have been contestants on the show 'Survivor: Blood Vs. Water,' which is airing on CBS.

Travis Boles, the grandfather of Taylor's girlfriend, 25-year-old Brittany Boles, told National Enquirer that the young man and a close friend were heading home from a party last Tuesday when the accident happened.

The vehicle they were in jumped up on impact with the garage, tossing the passenger, Taylor, out of the car. The driver suffered only minor injuries.

Mr Boles said Taylor had a habit of not wearing a seat belt, even though he knew it was illegal.

His obituary stated that Collins graduated from Pellissippi State Technical Community College and recently moved from Knoxville to Chattanooga for work. He had a passion for extreme sports, including motocross, wakeboarding and snowboarding.

Collins and Brittany Boles, a registered nurse, had lived together for six years and recently started talking about getting married.

'It will take a long, long time for Brittany to get over this loss because Taylor was the love of her life,' her grandfather told the magazine.  

Tina Wesson, 52, a former nurse, is a 'Survivor' alum: she had won season 2 of the show in 2001, taking home $1milion in prize money after defeating 15 other contestants in Australia's outback, among them TV presenter Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

This season, she was joined by her 26-year-old daughter, who traveled with her to the Philippines to take part in the castaway competition. Although 'Survivor' is still being shown on TV every Wednesday, filming had wrapped up months earlier.

Miss Wesson has gained a reputation for her tenacity and courage. In one episode, she braved a flood in order to salvage a can of rice.
