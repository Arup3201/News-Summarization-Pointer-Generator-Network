Cristiano Ronaldo demonstrated his considerable physique by taking off his shirt after scoring Real Madrid's fourth in their 4-1 victory over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final.

The Portuguese forward emulated Mario Balotelli's celebration from Euro 2012 when the AC Milan striker took his shirt off after scoring in Italy's 2-1 win over Germany in the semi-final.

Ronaldo, who was playing in his home country, scored the fourth goal from the penalty spot after goals from Sergio Ramos and Marcelo had given Real Madrid the initiative following Diego Godin's opener.

Ronaldo and Balotelli aren't the only ones to engage in such a celebration with Didier Drogba of Chelsea also following suit in the 2005 FA Cup final against Liverpool.

Other attacking players such as Edin Dzeko, Ricardo Vaz Te and Nouha Dicko have also performed this celebration after scoring critical goals for their team.
