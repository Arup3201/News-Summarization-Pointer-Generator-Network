When medal winner David Bond scooped gold at the last London Olympics over half a century ago, the event was a far cry from the all-encompassing, multi-billion pound 'Greatest Show on Earth' it is today.

Now 64 years after the capital last hosted the Games, Britain's only surviving gold medal winner has described how it felt competing in the first post-war Olympics in 1948.

Sporting hero Mr Bond, now 90, claimed gold as one half of the Swallow class sailing team - having taken unpaid leave from work to compete in the Games his bosses barely cared about.

And in stark contrast to the fever pitch surrounding London 2012, he told how holidaymakers in Britain did not even know the Olympics were on at all.

Mr Bond, also known as 'dinghy', forged an unbeatable partnership with Stewart Morris, originally from Norfolk, who passed away in 1991.

As he was a genuine amateur, he had to take unpaid leave from work to practice, with his employers paying no interest in his activity.

The gold medallist, who now spends most of his time between living in Spain and Falmouth in Cornwall, said: 'The participants are now professionals - they work full-time on improving their sport whereas in 1948 participants were amateurs.

'You practised your sport after work and at weekends and you funded yourself. There wasn't any sponsorship.

'I took unpaid leave from my job in the aircraft industry to take part in the games and my employers weren't the slightest bit interested in why I wanted the leave.'

David was born and brought up in Falmouth by his father who was also a sailing enthusiast, but unfortunately died of cancer in 1940 - eight years before his son won gold.

He didn't even know he would be competing in the games until March 1948, less than three months before the start.

David is now preparing to watch the Great British hopefuls at the London 2012 games gets into full flow this weekend.

However, the build-up to the games is a far cry to what he was used to back in 1948.

He said: 'There was very little atmosphere in anticipation of the Olympics in 1948 but it was a very different time then.

'There were a number of battleships manning the harbour and the Olympics were such an under reported local story that holidaymakers on the seaside were heard to ask: 'Who are all these young people from different countries and why are they here?'

'The other difference was the lack of media in 1948.

'There wasn't internet, TV, a wide range of newspapers or any of the multimedia sources there are today. So people weren't really aware of the Games.

'I didn't even know I was taking part until March 1948. So it was a very different approach then, although equally competitive.

'There was no media interest worth talking about. In 1948 the Daily Telegraph gave half a page a day or less to the sailing at Torquay - it was the only paper to do anything at all.'
