For most children, getting their hands on an iPad is an opportunity to play games, watch videos and surf the internet.

But at one primary school the Apple devices are being put to a more serious use – as a teaching tool for lessons in everything from maths to music.

Thirty-two iPads have been bought at a cost of £13,000 so that a whole class can use them at the same time. Children as young as four are taking part.

Hands-on learning: A junior class at North Crescent Primary School get to grips with their new educational tool

Lisa Wright, who is headmistress of North Crescent in Wickford, Essex, said the flexibility of the curriculum meant the iPads could be used right across the primary school.

‘Year Four children have used them in maths lessons and reception children have played some maths and phonics games,’ she said.

‘Year Ones had them in their religious education lesson and Year Five and Six pupils have been using iPads in their topics, such as learning about the Titanic by getting on the internet.’

The use of iPads is part of an overhaul of information and communications technology at the 214-pupil school.

Mrs Wright added: ‘We bought the iPads because they’re so flexible and versatile. We’ve got a lovely outdoor space here so the children can take them outside and even use them to take pictures.

Focus: The iPads are used by all year groups and in all subjects at the primary school

‘We want learning to be fun for the children. The iPads are in use all the time.

‘If you walk around the school, there’s a child somewhere or a group using the iPad which is what I want to see.’

However, Mrs Wright insists books and conventional teaching methods such as pencil and paper are equally important.

Thought: The school spent £13,000 on 32 of the expensive Apple tablet devices

Earlier this year, Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg claimed school textbooks could be replaced by devices.

An Ofsted report last year said pupils were showing high degrees of concentration when doing mental arithmetic on handheld games consoles.

But Dr Aric Sigman, a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine, has argued against a technology ‘free for all’.

‘Children first need to learn how to concentrate before they start dividing their attention up with different windows on a screen and different forms of entertainment,’ he said.
