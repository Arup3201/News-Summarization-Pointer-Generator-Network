Turf wars have erupted after daring lawn raiders stole a family's front garden.

Father-of-two Steve Woolnough was astonished to wake up one morning... only to discover the late-night thieves had stolen his beloved lawn.

Mr Woolnough, 54, of Ipswich, Suffolk, had laid the 100sq ft astroturf to spruce up his home's appearance.

Mr Woolnough, 54, of Ipswich, Suffolk, had laid the 100sq ft astroturf to spruce up his home's appearance. Pictured, his grandson playing on the grass before it was stolen

But now he has been left with a £250 bill to replace the artificial grass after it was pinched under cover of darkness.

He said: 'I'm absolutely seething over it, I really am. 

'How dare someone have the cheek to steal what I have had to work hard for.

'You try and make your house look nice and someone comes along and steals what you have got.'

The gang struck between 10.30pm on March 19 and 6am the following day.

Police forensic experts scoured his looted garden after footprints were left behind by the thieves.

'I have had it in my garden for the past six years,' said Mr Woolnough.

Mr Woolnough, a systems IT consultant, said he won't put down artificial turf again unless he installs CCTV cameras

'During the small hours, someone decided their need for it was greater than mine.'

Villains have tried to take the fake turf before but gave up because of the weight of the material.

Mr Woolnough said this time the crooks professionally planned the raid from start to finish.

'Whoever did it knew what they were doing because they knew the weight of it,' said the grandfather-of-four.

'I have not had my garden stolen before - it's quite strange.'

Mr Woolnough, a systems IT consultant, said he won't put down artificial turf again unless he installs CCTV cameras.

Police are appealing for witnesses as they hunt the lawn looters.

A Suffolk Police spokeswoman said: 'This is a very unusual incident.

'It would have taken some time to remove such a large quantity of astroturf from this garden and needed a vehicle to take it away.

'Officers want to speak to anyone who may have seen any suspicious persons or vehicles in this area [at the time].'
