She's blissfully content in a long-term relationship with Bradley Cooper, but if the Hollywood heartthrob wants to avoid getting the green-eyed monster, he may want to look away now.

In her latest campaign, model Suki Waterhouse gets ups close and personal with British musician George Le Page wearing nothing but a Burberry heritage cashmere scarf.

The duo can be seen in a close embrace with Suki's lipstick marks on George's cheek. 

The racy and flirty campaign, which promotes Burberry Kisses - the brand’s most extensive range of lipsticks - was shot in London by photographer Mario Testino, under the creative direction of Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer Christopher Bailey.

The make-up look for the campaign, developed by Burberry Make-up Artistic Consultant, Wendy Rowe, features radiant glowing skin with Burberry Kisses in Military Red, a signature shade from the new range - and doesn't Suki wear it well.

Always one to spot new talent (Christopher has previously tapped James Bay and Tom Odell for his shows), the campaign is accompanied by the dulcet tones of British Burberry Acoustic musician, Misty Miller.

Suki, whose seventh campaign this is for the luxury brand, gets up close and personal with George, who also stars in the brand's SS15 campaign alongside Jourdan Dunn and Naomi Campbell

Suki has long been a Burberry family member and is also the face of Brit Rhythm Floral Eau De Toilette

This is Burberry stalwart Suki's seventh campaign for the luxury brand; alongside her role as the current face of new Brit Rhythm Floral Eau De Toilette and the Spring/Summer 2015 Burberry Make-up collection.

George Le Page, meanwhile, who drums in Of Empires, is the current face of the brand’s Spring/Summer 2015 main campaign alongside Jourdan Dunn, Naomi Campbell and George Barnett.

Buildable, moisturising and lightweight, Burberry Kisses lipsticks are designed to feel like second skin on the lips. 

The finish promises to be luminous and even, with lips left feeling smooth and hydrated; so will Suki be testing it out on Bradley?

The pair were last spotted together  at the 2015 Academy Awards last Sunday.

The fashionista had initially arrived separately from her boyfriend, but was later seen with him inside the venue where they comprised the perfect couple.

After two years of dating, Suki and Bradley are reportedly ready to take the next big step in their relationship.

The Hollywood actor, 40, is said to be on the lookout for a London pad for himself and the 23-year-old beauty as he prepares for his 12-week stint in West End show The Elephant Man from May.
