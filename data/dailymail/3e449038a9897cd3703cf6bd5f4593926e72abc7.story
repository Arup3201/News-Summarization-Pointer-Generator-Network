Warning: Sir John Sawers said Russia posed a ‘state to state threat’ and dealing with that would require defence spending

Russia has become a danger to Western nations and Britain must be prepared to take steps to defend itself and its allies, the former head of MI6 said yesterday.

Sir John Sawers, who recently retired after five years as chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, said Russia posed a ‘state to state threat’ and dealing with that would require defence spending.

He said he was disappointed at how, after the Cold War, Russia’s and Europe’s paths had failed to converge. ‘The one level in which Russia and America are equals is at the nuclear level,’ he said.

‘We shouldn’t kid ourselves that Russia is on a path to democracy because it isn’t.’

He said we lived in a much more dangerous world. ‘The stability that we had during the Cold War, or the predominance of the West that we had in the decade or two after the Cold War, that is now changing… and there are real dangers associated with that.’

Sir John told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Russia had always been a concern for the Security Services. ‘Europe and Russia are not converging with one another so we’re going to have to find a new way to co-exist.

‘This crisis at the moment – it’s focused on Ukraine but Ukraine is a symptom. It’s not the real problem.

‘The real problem is how we live with a Russia which feels very exposed. Putin’s actions are ones of a leader who believes his own security is at stake. And here, we’ve got nuclear bombers approaching the Cornish coast.’

Speaking on Radio 4, Sir John said: 'Putin’s actions are ones of a leader who believes his own security is at stake. And here, we’ve got nuclear bombers approaching the Cornish coast'

On the threat posed by Islamic extremists, Sir John said there were several reasons why people became radicalised.

The first was that Muslims ‘are less well integrated’ into UK society ‘and there are a number of social and economic factors that are related to that’.

Secondly, he said, the Islamic religion ‘as a whole’ was not geared to reviving and modernising itself.

‘So there’s a big political challenge which can only really be taken up by leaders in the Islamic world… it can’t be imposed by the West,’ he added.
