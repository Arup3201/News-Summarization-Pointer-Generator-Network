Heartless vandals have destroyed a Second World War memorial just days before Britain honours its heroes on Remembrance Sunday.

The sick thieves stole a plaque bearing the names of those who died fighting in the Second World War from a war memorial in Brentwood, Essex.

The shocking theft comes shortly before veterans and the public are set to parade through the town on November 11.

John Woolmore, 74, who is chairman of the Brentwood branch of the Royal British Legion, slammed the thieves for causing ‘immeasurable sentimental damage’ to proud families of fallen soldiers in the town.

Mr Woolmore’s father, Francis Joseph Woolmore, who died in 1944 serving his country in the Second World War, is remembered on one of the seven remaining plaques at the memorial.

He said: 'This memorial means everything to me and many other families - especially at this time of year.

'I can’t believe that these thieves wouldn’t have known that the plaque contained the names of those who have given their lives for their country.

'This is all our fallen heroes have to be remembered by.

'I hope these thieves understand they have caused immeasurable sentimental damage just to earn a few quid for scrap metal.

'I can’t believe how people can be such idiots.'

The theft comes less than eight months after vandals destroyed a memorial in neighbouring Warley, Essex, honouring nine brave soldiers from Royal Anglian Regiment who died whilst serving in Afghanistan five years ago.

Brentwood Borough Council officials are now in a race against time to install a new plaque in time for Remembrance Sunday on November 11.

Councillor Louise McKinlay, leader of Brentwood Borough Council, said: 'I am appalled by the theft of one of the panels at the Brentwood War Memorial.

'I condemn the callous behaviour of whoever is responsible for ripping down this panel listing the names of the fallen to make themselves a few pounds.

'Anyone with information should contact the police straightaway.

'We have photos of all the panels and we will be trying as hard as we can to get the stolen panel replaced before the Remembrance Day parade.

'I have also instructed officers to make sure the panels are as secure as they can be.'

Local councillor Russell Quirk added: 'It is absolutely disgusting and, coming up to Remembrance Day, the timing could not be more inappropriate.

'This is the ultimate disrespect for what - £30? What is it that drives these people to desecrate memorials?

'What is it that drives these people to want to make a quick buck out of the war dead? It’s baffling.'

Police believe thieves ripped the metal plaque off the stone memorial sometime between Thursday, 18 and Friday, October 26.

The theft was not reported to the council and police until Tuesday.

The memorial contains 16 plaques honouring soldiers who died serving their country in the First and Second World War.

An Essex Police spokesperson said: 'If anybody has any information, or saw anything suspicious then please call police at Brentwood on 101.'
