An Australian man who suffered shocking injuries when he crashed his motorbike into a tree in Bali will not be allowed to leave Indonesia by authorities unless he finds a way to pay his $10,000 medical bill.

Liam Rudd, 24, is in a serious condition in hospital after suffering a fractured skull, bleeding and swelling on the brain and leg injuries after crashing last Sunday, just a week after arriving.

Mr Rudd has been pleading with his twin sister, Tanika, to 'please get me out of here'.

Tanika Rudd, revealed to Daily Mail Australia, that Indonesian doctors told her that they would not be able to perform emergency surgery, the day after his accident, without being paid up-front.

'They wanted $3500 up-front and when I said 'I haven't got that money, I'm just a single mum" they told me that "if you don't he's going to die", all I could tell them was I promise I would do everything I could to get the money,' Miss Rudd told Daily Mail Australia.

'They did the emergency surgery because they had to stop bleeding.'

Miss Rudd will leave her two-year-old son Kobi behind to make a mercy dash to the island this weekend, to be by his Liam's side. But she doesn't know when they will be able to leave the country for Australia. 

She's been told by government officials that they will not allow Liam to leave the country until all expenses are settled.

'I had to keep the money problems quiet, I don't want him worrying about it too but I had to get him moved from the private hospital because it cost $1500 for the first night.'

That's why friends have set up the GiveForward pledge page to try and help with the soaring hospital costs. 

'He's pretty confused still and doesn't know why I am not there with him but he is improving a lot, he's starting to put sentences together,' Miss Rudd added.

Mr Rudd lost control of his motorcycle and crashed heavily on Sunday, just a week after relocating to Indonesia. He was found unconscious on the side of the road by one of his Indonesian friends..

'No one really thought he was going to make it, at first,' Miss Rudd admitted.

'The embassy has been amazing, I got my emergency passport and a friend has paid for a one-way ticket to get me over there.

'I'm getting consular assistance too but they can't help with the money but I have to get there, no one else can.' The twins' mother died when they were young. 

Miss Rudd expects the bill to 'be at least $10,000' by the time Liam is well enough to leave hospital. She has no information about what level of travel insurance, if any, her brother may have had.

'I am really grateful for all the help we're getting, I hope I can bring him home soon,' she said.

His friend Nathan Reynolds is among those who is trying to raise funds to cover the costs and get him out of the country.

His GiveForward campaign says: 'Our good friend, Liam Rudd, was involved in a serious motorcycle accident after moving from Australia to Indonesia a few weeks ago.'

'He sustained severe injuries including a fractured skull and internal bleeding in the brain,' he states.

'He is in need of surgery to place a plate in his skull and to stop the internal bleeding.

'After just moving to a new country, the financial circumstances surrounding this accident are not good news.

'There is already a few thousand dollars debt accumulated for his time already spent in hospital, and he is need of a further $7000 for the surgery, medication expenses, and approximately $800 a day for him to remain in the Intensive care unit.

'We are asking for assistance to help pay for his medical expenses.

'We are desperate, and with such distance between us and Indonesia, the only thing we have to offer is our love and support.

'We are hoping the generosity of others may help us alleviate his medical expenses

'Even if you can only spare a few dollars to help out, it will all be very much appreciated.'

Tanika Rudd says she's been told her brother is suffering memory loss and still has swelling on the brain.
