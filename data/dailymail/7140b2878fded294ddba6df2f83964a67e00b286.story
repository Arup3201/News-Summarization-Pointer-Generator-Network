Katy Perry dodged deflate-gate, took a leaf out of Marshawn Lynch’s book and promised lions and tigers during her half-time Super Bowl show.

The pint-sized pop princess also welcomed her dog onto the stage and teased that an unnamed ‘old school’ female singer will make jaws drop when she appears.

‘I don't think I'm so much of an expert on the game of football, but I can assure everyone in here, nothing in my performance will be deflated,’ Perry said, effortlessly deflecting the controversy which has dogged the build-up to Sunday’s game.

And Perry continued to show her savvy concerning the NFL showpiece, saying: ‘I'm just here so I don't get fined,’ deadpan when asked about her personal life. She repeated the catchphrase for good measure.

Lenny Kravitz is penned in to appear on stage with Perry, whose hits include Roar and Firework, both of which will be played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.

And Twitter is abuzz after the playful Perry teased punters as to the identity of the female star.

‘When you hear the first ring of the chord, I think jaws will drop and faces will melt,’ she said.
