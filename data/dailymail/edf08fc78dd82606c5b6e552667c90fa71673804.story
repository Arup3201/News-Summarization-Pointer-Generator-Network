Ibiza holidaymakers can expect to see an increase in fake tans and hair extensions on the beach next summer.

Following this week's premiere of TOWIE spin-off The Only Way Is Ibiza, web searches for the Balearic island increased by 111 per cent, Hotels.com reports.

Fans of the Essex-based show hoping to holiday like their onscreen heroes flooded the website, which saw a sudden surge in interest for accommodation in Ibiza, despite the summer party season ending a week ago.

The traditional annual closing parties have already taken place, though a handful of smaller clubs remain open. The tourist season picks up again at the start of May.

The Only Way Is Ibiza saw the TOWIE crew swap their usual destination of choice, Marbella, for the Spanish island for a fortnight of debauchery.

The reality series is already a proven influencer: the two-part Marbella special airing earlier in the summer saw searches on Hotels.com increase 72 per cent overnight.

Lizann Peppard of Hotels.com said, 'The Only Way Is Essex is clearly a force to be reckoned with when it comes to providing inspiration for our next holiday! 

'The exploits of this popular bunch clearly make us want to look for our own sunny getaways as shown by these figures even after the closing parties have ended. 

'Our site offers great deals all year round for places like Ibiza so there is no need to be 'well jel' of their fun in the sun!'

One of the hot spots the cast were filmed at in Ibiza was Hacienda Na Xamena, recognisable by its iconic tiered infinity pool. 

The reality stars were also seen at Ocean Beach Ibiza, Hotel Es Vive and Surf House on the island.

The next episode of The Only Way Is Ibiza airs on October 12 on ITVBe.
