A puppy has survived after vets pulled out a 10-inch sewing needle that impaled the dog's chest and pierced its heart.

Four-month-old Tutti fell on the needle in Chris Shaw and Bradley Justice's home in Durham, North Carolina, on New Year's Eve.

The object speared the 10-pound papillion as it jumped from the sofa to a coffee table, just after it had been bathed by its owners. 

Lucky escape: A four-month-old puppy survived after vets extracted a needle that  pierced its heart. This X-Ray shows the needle inside the dog before the procedure

Speared: The papillion called Tutti fell on the sewing needle in Durham, North Carolina on New Year's Eve. Vets at the Triangle Veterinary Referral Hospital have fitted a cone

Tutti was then rushed to the Triangle Veterinary Referral Hospital where X-rays showed it had speared its chest and reached the animal's heart.

The vets were able to extract the object by sliding it out while the animal was sedated.

Veterinary cardiologist Jennifer Myers, 31, told The News Observer: 'The owners were definitely, understandably, upset and concerned. The dog was remarkably calm.

'The first question is, "How far in does this go, and is it damaging anything on its way in?"

She added: 'The first few minutes were the most critical. Once she woke up from anesthesia, she was a very sweet little dog.

Procedure: The team treating Tutti were able to extract the object by pulling it out while Tutti was sedated

Extracted: Veterinary cardiologist Jennifer Myers described how Tutti wanted to be 'held and cuddled' after the needle was taken out

'Really, she woke up and was looking around. She wanted to be held and cuddled.'

Owner Mr Shaw told WSAV that the needle was sticking out of Tutti's chest as they drove the dog to the hospital.

He described how he came in to find the dog virtually lifeless on the floor or his living room and thought she had already died.  

He said: 'Brad had been knitting a Barbie-sized sweater and had put his knitting on the coffee table and [we] figure that she got a hold of it and possibly jumped off of our sofa. 

'She went limp and stuck her tongue out, and we thought she had expired.'

Just 24 hours later, Tutti was back home and fitted with a cone.
