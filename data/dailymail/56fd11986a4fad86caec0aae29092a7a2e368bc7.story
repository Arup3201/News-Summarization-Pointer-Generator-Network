In a moment of need, many people call on God to help them.

Now, a study has found that just being reminded of God gives people the courage to seek out and take risks.

Psychologists suggest that religious people are willing to take risks because they believe God will protect them from harm.

A study has found that reminders of God give people courage to seek out and take risks. For example, those who saw adverts included a mention of God – for example, ‘God knows what you’re missing! Find skydiving near you,’ were more inclined to click on it, with a view to taking risks

The study, published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, goes against previous research that suggest religious people are less likely to engage in risky behaviour, such as gambling.

From bumper stickers to colloquial expressions, references to God pervade daily life, said lead researcher Daniella Kupor of Stanford University Graduate School of Business.

‘In fact, the word “God” is one of the most common nouns in the English language.

‘The fact that reminders of God are so ubiquitous suggests that this effect may impact a large number of people.’

Previous studies have indicated religious people are less likely to gamble or take drugs – seen as risky behaviours – but Ms Kupor and her colleagues noticed that the risks examined in these studies tended to share a negative moral component.

An free app called Instapray lets people send prayers or words of encouragement - regardless of religious persuasion - to others who are having a difficult time.

This can be in the form of public posts, or in private groups with friends as well as strangers.

A ticker on the site shows that more than 33 million prayers have been posted using the app in 195 countries, which is the equivalent of 192 years of prayers.

The name isn't restricted to religious people, it can be used by anyone with spiritual beliefs or people who want to discover and discuss world events.

Members of the Instapray community can post prayers and encouragement publicly or create private groups.

They can also join more broad-based groups that focus on global issues concerning peace in the Middle East, victims of natural disasters, or a cure for Ebola, for example.

The researchers hypothesised that thinking about God may have a different effect in relation to risks that have no moral connotation, such as doing a bungee jump, since people tend to view God as a source of protection and security.

To investigate, they issued online surveys to nearly 900 people and found that those who were reminded of God - either by working on word scrambles that included God-related words or by reading a paragraph about God - were more willing to take risks than participants who weren’t prompted to think about religion.

In one study, for example, participants were asked to choose which version of the study they wanted to complete.

One version would give them a small bonus payment, but involved looking at an ‘extremely bright colour’ that they were told could potentially damage their eyes, while the other version involved looking at a harmless darker colour.

The researchers found that participants who had been reminded of God before making their choice were more likely to opt for the dangerous version of the experiment – at 96 per cent – than those who hadn’t been reminded of God, at 84 per cent.

In another study, the researchers posted variations of three adverts online and recorded the click-through rates for each.

Some adverts promoted an immoral risk, such as ‘learn how to bribe,’ others promoted a non-moral risk, such as ‘find skydiving near you’ and another set promoted no risk, such as ‘find amazing video games’.

In some cases, the adverts included a mention of God – for example, ‘God knows what you’re missing! Find skydiving near you.’

The research revealed that when the adverts included a religious reference, people clicked on the non-moral risk of skydiving, more often.

However, they clicked on the bribing - moral risk - less often.

People clicked about the same number of times on the computer games advert, with or without a mention of God.

‘We were surprised to find that even a simple colloquial expression - “God knows what you’re missing” - influences whether people click on a real online ad that is promoting a risky behaviour,’ Ms Kupor said.

The study also  indicated that people who were reminded of God perceived less danger in various risky behaviours than participants who were not reminded of God.

And they reported more negative feelings toward God when they lost their potential winnings in a risk-related game, suggesting that they had expected God to protect them from losing the money and were disappointed in the outcome.

The researchers noted that this effect may apply to people from cultures in which God is not seen as a protective force.

Contradicts previous research that hinted religious people are risk averse

Experiments found thinking about god makes people more likely to take  risks, including non-moral 'dangers' such as skydiving

But  they were less interested in taking moral risks, like gambling
