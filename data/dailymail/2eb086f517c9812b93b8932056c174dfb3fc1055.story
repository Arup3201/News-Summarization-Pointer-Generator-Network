Tragedy: Cpl Kevin Gale Stauffer, 38, was killed after trying to apprehend a car of suspected bank robbers

The FBI has launched a nationwide search for a gunman who killed a policeman during a bank robbery just two days before Christmas.

Father-of-two Corporal Kevin Gale Stauffer, 38, from Tupelo, Mississippi, was shot when he tried to stop suspects in a car as they waited at a level crossing.

At least one of the gang fired Cpl Stauffer at close range from inside the vehicle before driving off, ABC News reported.

Fellow officer, Joseph Maher, 27, was also shot and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

Detectives today increased the reward from $152,000 to $162,500 for information that can help them catch the suspects, believed to have robbed BancorpSouth bank in Tupelo.

They are looking for a thin, possibly African-American man with light complexion, between 5ft 9in and 6in, according to Mississippi Department of Public Safety.

CCTV footage, which has been released to the public, shows one of the suspects in a convenience store wearing khaki trousers, white Converse trainers, a long-sleeved jacket and a blue ski mask.

They are thought to have been driving a dark grey sedan.

A team of more than 100 worked over Christmas Day and Boxing Day to trace the gang.

On Christmas Day, a candlelit vigil was held in the town centre for Mr Stauffer, a combat veteran of the Louisiana Army National Guard.

Tupelo Mayor Jason Shelton praised Cpl Stauffer, who 'made the ultimate sacrifice for his community'.

Grieving wife Beth Stauffer told WTVA-TV: 'I have my moments. But, I'm at peace with Gale because I know he died doing something he loved.

Memorial: Dozens attended a candlelit vigil in Tupelo, Mississippi on Christmas Day for the father-of-two

Shaken: Members of the community also held a silence for Officer Joseph Maher, 27, who was also shot by the suspects and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition

Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre spoke at the vigil, praising Cpl Stauffer, who worked for the department for eight years. The FBI set a reward for information from $152,000 to $162,500

'The way he was at work as a leader is what he was like at home.'

His mother, Debbie Brangenberg, thanked the dozens that attended the memorial service on Wednesday, saying the strength of the community keeps the family strong.

She added: 'Everybody has been so wonderful to us through this week.

'And, the overwhelming love and support that this community has given us has helped us make it through.'
