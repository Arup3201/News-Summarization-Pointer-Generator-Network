The word at Tottenham’s state-of-the-art Enfield training complex is that the club will make a concerted effort to sign Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez in January.

What is for sure is manager Mauricio Pochettino needs to inject some life into his misfiring forward line sooner rather than later.

Wednesday night's Capital One Cup clash against Brighton merely underlined the White Hart Lane club’s need for a new striker once the transfer window re-opens.

Between them, Spurs’ strike trio of Emmanuel Adebayor, Roberto Soldado and Harry Kane have scored five domestic goals this season.

Adebayor and Kane have two each; Soldado has one. In short: not good enough. Certainly not good enough for a team with aspirations of breaking into the Champions League qualification places.

It was Soldado and Kane’s turn to improve upon that dismal record on Wednesday night. But, once more, chance after chance was squandered before Kane tapped in late on to put the result beyond doubt.

Pochettino, upon his arrival from Southampton in the summer, insisted he wanted to give those at the club a chance to ink themselves into his blueprint.

But the Argentine knows now he’ll have to buy a new striker in January.

His interest in Rodriguez, a player he worked with and helped nurture at St Mary’s, is no secret.

There was a willingness, certainly from Pochettino, to strike a deal with the Saints for the England international, whose long-term knee injury meant that Tottenham’s interest cooled.

Yet Pochettino inherited this Spurs forward line, and until he is able to stamp his mark on it via the transfer market, he cannot truly call this his side.

Those in the corridors of power at White Hart Lane know that, too, and are prepared to fund his move for Rodriguez at the turn of the year.

The Spurs boss feels Rodriguez’s pace and movement can help transform his forward line for the final months of the season.

Persuading Rodriguez to leave upwardly-mobile Southampton for Spurs might be harder than it sounds, though, and Pochettino will hope his relationship with the striker will lure him to London.
