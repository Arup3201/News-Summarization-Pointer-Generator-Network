It's a rare and unsettling phenomenon that animal lovers may find hard to swallow - though, perhaps not as hard as the razor-toothed reptile in question.

But a hungry crocodile has been captured on camera chomping on one of its less fortunate cousins in a rare documented case of cannibalism.

The two-metre long reptile, nicknamed Eric, was hunting for prawns and small fish when he came across the other crocodile.

But instead of ignoring the younger croc, he attacked the metre long rival, killed and ate it himself head first in a grim, cannibalistic spectacle.

A light bite: The two-metre long reptile, nicknamed Eric, was hunting for prawns and small fish when he came across the other crocodile

The moment was captured by David White, who runs Solar Whisper boat tours on the Daintree River in Queensland, Australia.

Mr White said: 'He had obviously killed it and was attempting to swallow it, but it was just a little too big, so he swam away with it.

'When we saw him a few days later, he had a big belly so he must have finished it.

'I have been working on the Daintree river for about 15 years and this is the third time I have seen this happen.

No messing: The saltwater crocodile is the world's largest reptile and they are known for their fierce, territorial natures

'The other two times hatchlings were the victims but this was a two-year-old being eaten by a seven-year old.

While saltwater crocodile attacks on 
humans are rare, there are almost no recorded incidents of crocodiles 
eating their own kind.

They are known to be 
very lethargic creatures - a trait that allows them to survive for up to a month without eating.

But when they do eat, their diet 
tends to consist of almost anything they can sink their teeth into, 
including crustaceans, fish, turtles, snakes, lizards, birds, bats, 
kangaroos, dingoes, domestic dogs, horses, cattle, buffalo, pigs and, 
sometimes, humans.

They have even been observed feeding on sharks.

What they cannot digest, such as 
bones and hair, they tend to regurgitate or leave to one side. They are 
known to bring up giant hair balls of feral pig hair.

When attacking very large prey, they always rely on their lightening-speed ambushing technique - but can also run very fast over short distances if they choose to.

Crocodiles are known to leap out of the water to grab prey and can propel themselves vertically for most of their body length straight up in the air to grab prey.

'We
call him Eric, although it could be Erica. He is about two-metres long.
Saltwater crocodiles are opportunistic feeders and there is no emotion 
involved.'

While saltwater crocodile attacks on 
humans are rare, there are almost no recorded incidents of crocodiles 
eating their own kind.

Signs warning humans not to venture 
near waters known to house saltwater crocodiles in Australia are common,
but that has not prevented tragedies from occurring.

Last December, a 12-year-old boy was 
snatched by one such beast in the country's Northern Territory, and 
dragged out into the water where he was devoured.

Less than two weeks earlier a 
seven-year-old girl was killed by a crocodile in the the same state.

Police searching the waterhole shot dead a
10ft crocodile and an examination of the reptile revealed what were 
believed to be remains of the child in its stomach.

The saltwater crocodile is the world's largest reptile and they are known for their fierce, territorial natures.

They can grow up to more than six-metres in length and, while known as 'salties', they are most commonly found in freshwater.

They are found in suitable habitats from Northern Australia through Southeast Asia to the eastern coast of India, historically ranging as far west as off the eastern coast of Africa and as far east as waters off of Japan.
