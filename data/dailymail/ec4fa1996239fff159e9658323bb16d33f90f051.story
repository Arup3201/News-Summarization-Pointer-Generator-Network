Manu Tuilagi is the missing link for England according to Leicester, who expect their Anglo-Samoan centre to return from injury later this month and in good time to prepare for the Six Nations.

The 23-year-old’s recovery from a groin problem will serve as a Christmas present for club and country. The Tigers and the national team have had cause to lament the absence of the wrecking-ball runner.

Tuilagi has not played since suffering his latest setback at the end of October, during a European Champions Cup tie against Ulster.

He was ruled out of the autumn Tests at Twickenham, amid initial fears that he may not re-surface until the new year, leaving him facing a rush to be ready for championship duty.

Instead, Richard Cockerill, Leicester’s director of rugby, said: ‘Manu will hopefully be back by the end of December, give or take a week or two. He needs rest and treatment.’

Asked if the Tigers have been missing their forceful No 13, he added: ‘You’ve got to be able to dent the opposition line. When you are in stalemate, you need physicality - that is the reality of it. Manu gives you that. We have missed that bit of punch in our team.’

His spell of inactivity has been a problem for England, too. National coach Stuart Lancaster has been forced to continually rotate his midfield options in the search for a potent mix, but Cockerill is adamant that a fit Tuilagi provides 50 per cent of the solution at a stroke.

‘Manu has been huge for England,’ he said. ‘When England have played at their best, Manu has been at his best. Hopefully, he will be fit and playing come Christmas time and he will be back into the England squad for the Six Nations. 

'The midfield is the biggest problem England have got, isn’t it? Manu gives you that one position solved. He is their best 13. Then they have to solve who is best at 12 - thankfully that’s somebody else’s problem.’

Leicester endured a turbulent start to the season against a backdrop of multiple injuries, but their fortunes are on the turn.

As they prepare for the visit of European champions Toulon on Sunday, England forwards Geoff Parling and Tom Croft are on standby to make comebacks, most likely as replacements.

Repeated concussion had cast some doubt over Parling’s future but Cockerill reported that the Lions lock has made a complete recovery.

Tom Croft is also on standby as a possible replacement in their European Champions Cup match

‘Geoff has been training pretty much fully for the last couple of weeks and he is good to go,’ he said. ‘We’ve given his brain the rest that we’ve been recommended to give it. He has been symptom-free for several weeks now. Obviously he’s not been able to do any contact but he’s been doing full conditioning.

‘On the specialist’s advice we’ve slowly integrated him back into training — non-contact training first, then in the last week or so he’s been starting to do the live tackling and scrummaging.

‘This week he’ll train fully and he will be involved at the weekend.’

Croft was due to return from a knee injury last weekend but withdrew from the game to be at the birth of his daughter, Victoria.

Now Cockerill believes the flanker and Parling will want to reclaim their places in the Leicester starting XV, to make a case for new contracts.
