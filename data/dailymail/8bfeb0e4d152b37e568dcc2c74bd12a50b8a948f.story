Comedian Chris Ramsey lists his top tips for students on surviving Freshers Week 

Moving out of home for the first time to go to university is a big leap and there are hundreds of books out there teaching you how to boil an egg or pay a TV licence. 

But those guides never tell you the REAL need-to-know tips for surviving the first term. 

Did you know that you will never buy enough loo roll? Or that no one wants to be friends with the person where a university logo sweater?  

So Femail has enlisted stand-up comedian, Celebrity Juice regular and University Of Sunderland graduate Chris Ramsey to provide the full low-down on getting through Fresher's Week. 

 

1) Plan your living arrangements early… but not too early: 

If you're living in dorms for your first year, you will have automatically been allocated a bunch of people to hate the smell of and argue about washing up with for the next year, so don't worry. 

But when the time comes to get yourself a house, you need to be quick! 

Make sure you get bunked up with people you like, don't be stuck in a two bedroom below ground floor flat with the guy who breathes loudly at the back of lectures. 

But for heaven's sake don't ask people about second year housing too early, that's like proposing on the first date; 'Can I borrow a pen please mate?', 'LETS LIVE TOGETHER!' 

 

2) Buy LOTS of toilet roll: 

Seriously, you can NEVER have too much bog roll. 

This will be the first time you have lived on your own. I know the loo roll just magically regenerates in Mummy and Daddy's house, but seriously, it basically evaporates in a shared house… be prepared, no one wants to wipe their a*** on a School Disco Night flyer.

3) Make friends with the guys at the student union: 

Yes, this sounds creepy. Yes, some of the people who work there will be about 50 years old. 

But you can never underestimate the favours that can be pulled by a mate at the student union. 

Forgot to get tickets to that cool band? Student union mate will help. 

They are only accepting vouchers for drinks and you lost all of yours? Student union mate will help. 

Need a body moved? Well… you've gone too far mate. Call your solicitor.

Students are warned to avoid microwaving smelly foods and stick to takeaway meals instead 

4) Don't microwave stuff that stinks: 

No matter where you are. Just because you are hungry, doesn't mean you need to fumigate the entire house with the smell of your second course leftovers. It's antisocial. 

If you need to eat in hurry… you know that massive pile of stuff that makes it hard to open your front door? Those are takeaway menus. Use them.

5) Never wear a jumper depicting the university name: 

Don't. Just don't. People at Uni will hate you. People outside Uni will hate you. No one is impressed. You are not in American Pie. Stop it.  

Comedian Chris Ramsey has suggested all students avoid playing extreme frisbee as it is the sport of imbecile 

6) Do not play Extreme Frisbee: 

Extreme Frisbee is the sport of the imbecile. 

It says 'Hey! Are you a bit too clumsy to play football? But not big enough to play rugby? Got no musical talent, or any talent at all to speak of generally? Do you need to get out there and ruin peoples days out in the park? 

'Run, fetch, and catch like a big stupid Labrador on a Saturday afternoon with all of your other big stupid Labrador friends… Play Extreme Frisbee. Release your inner big stupid Labrador today' 

 

7) Have stock excuses for being late: 

'Sorry, I missed the bus' is the worst. Don't be that guy. 

Be the guy who comes in late and spins a yarn Shakespeare himself would be proud of. 

Or simply confuse the lecturer into submitting. 

My mate once used the excuse 'Sorry I'm late, I fell over'… it was amazing. The lecturer had never heard something so stupid in her life, therefore, it had to be true.

Chris advises that students use normal condoms instead of those that are Freshers-week branded 

8) Use condoms: 

This may seem like the most obvious one on this list, but it's not. 

USE CONDOMS yes, but DO NOT USE the ones they give out on fresher's week. 

Firstly, it just looks weird. You get that ready for action and you are basically saying 'I've been dying to use this!' 

But even worse, if you whip that bad boy out in your second year, and blow the dust off it, you're going to look like you were keeping it as a souvenir 

9) Don't be a d***:

As in Uni, as in life. Enjoy your 'education'
