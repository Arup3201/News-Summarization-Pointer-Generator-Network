This eight-month-old shows he is just like dad, when he flexes his muscles in front the bathroom mirror.

And just in case we were in any doubt of his hidden strength, baby Hadley even managed to mimic his father and roar as he shows off his tiny biceps.

The adorable pair are filming themselves in the bathroom mirror as the father tries to make his son repeat his actions, before he has to stop because he is laughing too hard. 

Young Hadley seems very pleased with himself as he growls like his father and tenses his arms while he stands on the kitchen sink.

Hadley continues to mimic his father several times over before the heartwarming video descends into giggles. 

The father had been getting baby Hadley ready for a bath when the beautiful moment occurred and was captured on camera.

After his spectacular performance, the eight-month-old smiles as his dad laughs and says: 'I think we're done.'

Happy: The father and son duo admire their respective muscles in the mirror and pose confidently

Grunting sound: The father makes a masculine grunting noise and moments later his son copies him

Strong bond: The father and son share a heartwarming father and son moment in the touching video

Hilarious: The father cannot hide his delight as he laughs after the posing and grunting moment
