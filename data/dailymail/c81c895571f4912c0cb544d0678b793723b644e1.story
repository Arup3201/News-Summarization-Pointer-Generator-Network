The great and the good of the game queued up to pay glowing tributes to Arsenal legend Thierry Henry, who announced his retirement from football on Tuesday.

Mesut Ozil, Theo Walcott and Aaron Ramsey were among the current Gunners to praise their club's hero, while Arsenal themselves also paid a fitting tribute to Henry, who is taking up a role as 'football expert and ambassador' with Sky Sports.

Henry netted 228 goals in 377 games for Arsenal during two spells in north London - as well as winning the Premier League twice and lifting the FA Cup on three occasions.

And the club honoured the 37-year-old on Tuesday by displaying a 45-page gallery showing the many highlights of his  time at Highbury and latterly the Emirates on their website. It is entitled: 'Pictures: Thierry Henry's best moments.' 

During a stellar career spanning 18 years, Henry scored 360 club goals in 792 games for Monaco, Juventus, Arsenal Barcelona and New York Red Bulls.

He also netted 51 times in 123 international caps for France.

Chelsea midfielder and former Arsenal team-mate Cesc Fabregas was among those to show his appreciation for Henry.

Henry will be remembered as one of the best strikers ever to grace the Premier League

Fabregas posted on Twitter: 'Sad to see the end to the career of one of the best players I've ever played with. A true legend @thierryhenry! ;-).'

Current Gunner Walcott added: 'A true inspiration to me in my career. Thank you @Thierryhenry & good luck in your new path with @skysports.'

German World Cup winner Ozil was also full of praise for Henry.

He said: 'Once you enchanted all of us - now I can only say: Thanks for everything! @ThierryHenry #ArsenalLegend.'

Welsh midfielder Ramsey posted: 'Congratulations on an outstanding career @ThierryHenry. Top player. Top guy. #Legend.'

Another Gunner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, also revealed how much of a pleasure it was to play alongside Henry.

He posted: 'Was a honour to have played alongside this man! My idol and a big inspiration to my career... #KingHenry.' 

Having moved to north London from Juventus in 1999, the Frenchman spent eight years as a Gunner and became a legend at the club.

Henry is the highest scorer in Arsenal's history with 228 goals in all competitions, 175 of those coming in the Premier League.

He helped Arsene Wenger's side win the Premier League and FA Cup double in 2002 and was also part of the invincible title-winning team of 2004.

Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher - who Henry will join as a Sky Sports pundit - said of the Frenchman: 'Defenders everywhere will be breathing a sigh of relief that he has hung his boots up.

'He was certainly the toughest opponent I ever faced and possibly the best player the Premier League has seen.

'I would have loved him to be on the same team as me during my playing career, I'm delighted we're finally on the same side.'

Another soon-to-be colleague of Henry's is Gary Neville, who the Frenchman faced many times for Arsenal in battles against Manchester United.

Neville said: 'We were blessed in this country to see Thierry playing at his peak, potentially one of the greatest players in the world and even if you supported another team you couldn't help but enjoy watching him play.

'It's always a shame when such a career comes to an end, but it's very much Sky Sports' gain and I look forward to working with him.'

Former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp, who played at north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur while Henry was at the Gunners, said: 'I know from playing against Thierry how good a player he was and Sky Sports viewers are in for a treat.

'His game was built around incredible pace, power and finishing, not to mention the ability to read the game better than most. His views will be fascinating and I can't wait to work alongside him.'

The forward spent three years at Barcelona after leaving Arsenal, winning two La Liga titles and the Champions League, before moving to New York Red Bulls in 2010.

He returned to Arsenal for a loan spell in January 2012, scoring the winner against Leeds United in the FA Cup and Sunderland in the league.

But Henry's four-year stay in New York has now come to an end, and he will take up a role as an analyst with Sky Sports.

Elsewhere, Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge posted a message on Twitter about Henry.

He said: 'Happy retirement to my hero and idol @ThierryHenry. Wish you all the best in the next chapter.'

West Ham United on the other hand also sent out a good-luck message to Henry.

They posted: 'HENRY: West Ham United would like to wish @premierleague great @ThierryHenry all the very best in his retirement.'

Finally, Stoke City striker and former Barcelona team-mate Bojan Krkic also took to Twitter.

He said: 'You've been a very special person in one of the most wonderful stages of my life. An example of professional and person. A LEGEND. Thanks Titi!'
