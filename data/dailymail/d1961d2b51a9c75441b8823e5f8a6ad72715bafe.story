Arsene Wenger has told Arsenal fans not to expect a rush of new signings early this summer.

The manager, who saw his side sit at the top of the Premier League for more than 100 days this season, insists that getting bodies through the door in a World Cup year is a difficult process.

It has been a campaign of missed opportunities for the Gunners, although they can end their trophy drought with an FA Cup win against Hull City later this month.

Waiting game: Arsene Wenger has told supporters not to expect a rush of new signings this summer

The
 belief is that they need to sign a couple of top players this summer, 
but the manager doesn't hold hope for deals to be done early.

'In my experience, in a World Cup year, the transfer business does not get done early,' he said.

'Everybody is focused on the World Cup. At the moment you can do nothing because the season is not over.

'Do you realise it is one month from the start of the World Cup? It is unbelievable. The Champions League final is on the 24th May and basically two weeks later it is the start of the World Cup.

'There is no time between the end of the season and the start of the World Cup. Nobody will do anything before the World Cup starts.'

There appears to have been a slight change in policy at the Emirates Stadium over the last year.

Mesut Ozil was signed for a club record £42.5million from Real Madrid in September, while there was an ongoing saga with Liverpool and Luis Suarez which threatened to completely engulf the summer transfer window.

Wenger confirmed Laurent Koscielny is close to agreeing a new contract, but he needs a number of new faces in if they are to challenge for in Europe and the league.

He has been criticised for a perceived stubbornness in the past, but the Frenchman is in no mood to be dictated to by others as the search for added quality goes on.

Even after failing to win a trophy for nine years, the boss doesn't begrudge Manchester City their impending title.

'It
 looks like they’ll win it,' he said. 'It will need a miracle for them 
not to win. Congratulations to them. It was tight at the top and at the 
bottom.

'It
 was a season where City just won it, getting over the line. They won 
the marathon and they turned up in the last 100 yards. They turned up 
when it mattered. The turning point was the Everton game they won.

'It
 was not easy for them. Liverpool had an outstanding second part of the 
season. They are maybe the most unlucky team of the season. They were 
nearly there.

'We have been 128 days top of the league. So we have won the stamina league. But we faded in big games away from home.

'City scored 100 goals. We scored 66 at the moment. That’s where we have room for improvement.'

On his way: Jack Wilshere is set to play for Arsenal away at Norwich City on Sunday afternoon

Jack Wilshere is putting himself in a strong position to be considered an England starter at the World Cup as he returns from injury this weekend.

The midfielder is likely to be involved at some point during their game away at Norwich City.

He hasn't played since Roy Hodgson's side narrowly beat Denmark at Wembley in March after hobbling out with a foot injury just before the hour-mark and hasn't played for his club since.

Although the 22-year-old won't be anywhere near match fit, it is encouraging news for England fans ahead of the finals in Brazil.

While it's positive for Wilshere, forward Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is again missing for the Gunners as they travel to Carrow Road.
