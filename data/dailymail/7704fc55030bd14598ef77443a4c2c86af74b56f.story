With the baubles and tinsel packed away until next year, these festive athletes have found a novel way of getting rid of their Christmas trees - at an annual throwing contest.

Today marks Twelfth Night, the traditional end of the Christmas celebrations, when decorations are packed away, and trees packed away or recycled.

However, energetic types can always show off their strength and toss away their trees at the Christmas Tree Throwing World Championships, held in Wiedenthal, Germany.

Contest: Both men and women are allowed to compete in the event, which features three disciplines

The less-than-serious annual event is now in its eighth year and features competitions in distance throwing, height throwing and flinging of Christmas trees.

Also known as Knut-fest, the contest is made up of three disciplines: Weitwurf (javelin-style), Hammerwurf (hammer-style), and a Hochwurf (high jump-style).

The overall winner is decided by the total distance achieved over the course of the day.

Contestants themselves brought the trees, with all lights and decorations removed, to the competition, which was held yesterday.

When the festivities were over the crowds bid a fond 'auf wiedersehen' to their pines and spruces as they went up in a blaze of glory atop a huge bonfire.

More than 700 spectators attended the popular event, enjoying mulled wine and a fireworks display as well as the show of strength by contestants.
