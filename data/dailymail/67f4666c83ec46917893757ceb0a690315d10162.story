Charlie Sharples scored a hat-trick as Gloucester began a new era of European rugby with a bang by thrashing French side Brive in the inaugural Challenge Cup.

The overhaul of European rugby sees the competition replace the Amlin Challenge Cup this season and Gloucester launched their campaign in style with an emphatic victory at Kingsholm.

Sharples was making his 150th competitive appearance for the Cherry and Whites and the winger celebrated the milestone with a try in the first half and two more after half-time.

Brive looked to have hit back almost immediately after Sharples' first score in the 16th minute but the visitors' try was ruled out for a knock-on in the build-up.

Gloucester led 10-0 at the interval but the hosts, still rebuilding under the leadership of new director of rugby David Humphreys, rolled through the gears in the second period.

Sharples added two more to his tally while James Hook, Darren Dawidiuk and Dan Robson all crossed the whitewash as both sides were reduced to 14 men after Gloucester's Yann Thomas and Brive's Damien Jourdain were both shown yellow cards.

The hosts' victory had long been secured, however, and a penalty try in the dying minutes completed the rout.

Scrum-half Greig Laidlaw kicked 12 points for his side, slotting home three conversions and two penalties.

Gloucester face another French opponent, Oyonnax, next in Pool 5 before hosting Zebre on December 7.
