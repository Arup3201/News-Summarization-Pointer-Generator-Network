Britain's worst speeding offenders have been caught on camera going as fast as 146mph on a motorway – twice the 70mph legal speed limit.

And another driver was recorded travelling at 128mph in a 30mph zone, exceeding the area’s speed limit by 98mph.

The league table of speeding incidents caught on camera in England and Wales was compiled by the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) who asked police forces across the country to supply the highest speeds recorded in their areas last year.

Speed demons: Britain's worst speeding offenders have been caught on camera going as fast as 146mph on a motorway – more than twice the 70mph legal speed limit

The highest overall speed recorded by cameras in 2014 was 146mph and occurred on two separate occasions on the M25.

But one of the worst examples of excessive speeding was on the 30mph limit London Road in East Grinstead in West Sussex where one driver was recorded doing 128mph – more than four times the legal limit.

The highest figure recorded in a 50mph zone was 120mph on the A631 Beckingham Road and the worst speed caught on a 40mph road was 115mph on the A10 Great Cambridge Road in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. 

The highest overall speed recorded by cameras in 2014 was 146mph and occurred twice on the M25 – with two vehicles tying for the excessive speed top spot. 

Fast: Of the 36 England and Wales police forces who responded to the FOI request, all but six recorded top speeds of more than 110mph in 2014

One offender was caught travelling anti-clockwise around the M25 at junction 5 near Westerham in Kent, while the other was captured on film going clockwise at Swanley in Kent. 

There were also three more incidents in which drivers were recorded travelling at 140mph or more.

These comprised a vehicle hitting 145mph on the M6 Toll road in the West Midlands, a speed of 141mph captured on the A1 northbound at Great Ponton in Lincolnshire, and a car doing 140mph was filmed on the A5 near Crick in Northamptonshire.

Of the 36 England and Wales police forces who responded to the FOI request, all but six recorded top speeds of more than 110mph in 2014.

London's worst speeder was recorded at 123mph on a 30mph road in the capital by the Metropolitan Police. However, the location has not been revealed as the IAM said it claimed exemption under Section 31 of the Freedom of Information Act. 

Of the 41 police force areas the IAM requested the information from, 36 responded. All forces recorded at least one top speed over 110mph with the exception of City of London, Cleveland, Greater Manchester, Northumbria, West Midlands and South Yorkshire.

Wales’ top speeder was a driver who recorded 136mph on the A5 Ty Nant to Dinmael road in Conway, which has a 60mph limit.

The IAM said it supported the targeted use of safety camera systems at collision hot spots, on roads with a speed related crash record and at areas of proven risk, such as motorway road works. 

But it believes that improving driving skills and attitude is the key to reducing the numbers of people killed and injured on UK roads. It advocates advanced driving and riding tuition to help achieve this.

IAM chief executive office Sarah Sillars said: ‘It is disheartening to say the least that some road users are showing such disregard for the safety of all other road users. 

‘At speeds of 140mph an individual is travelling at nearly two-and-a-half miles a minute. At that speed it is simply impossible to react to anything that might happen in front of you.’ 

She added: ‘All these individuals are playing with their own lives and others. They are all accidents waiting to happen and it requires a major shift in the attitudes of these people to think about safety.’
