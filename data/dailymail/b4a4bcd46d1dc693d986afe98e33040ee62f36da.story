A young father who violently shook his newborn daughter, resulting in 15 fractures and a brain injury, has had his prison term doubled.

The man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was sentenced to at least two years' jail in December 2013 after confessing to attacking his six-week-old daughter, roughly shaking her and twisting her limbs on two occasions in July 2011.

The Crown appealed the original sentencing, arguing that the baby's crying did not reduce the father's moral culpability.

The jury found the man guilty of two counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

He will be jailed for a minimum of four years, with a maximum term of seven years. 

Young father who assaulted his six-week-old daughter on two occasions has had his prison term doubled after a Crown appeal. The father twisted his daughter's limbs and shook her violently

The man, who was 20 at the time of the attacks, initially denied responsibility before admitting to the court, '(I) lost control of myself and just shook my baby instead.'

According to court documents, during the first assault the man twisted his baby's limbs and violently shook her, as he 'took his anger out over his financial woes and frustrations generally on his six-week-old baby.'

The second attack took place while he felt angry and frustrated from financial pressures and the stress of living away from family members.

At the time of the attacks, the father weighed 170 kilograms and the baby weighed 4.6 kilograms.

During the initial sentencing in December 2013, Judge Martin Blackmore acknowledged that, 'unlike their first child, (the baby) was apparently quite a noisy and somewhat difficult baby.

 'Such behaviour in a child is challenging even for mature and experienced parents, which certainly the offender was not.

'It has to be recognised that a parent is capable of lashing out in frustration when dealing with a crying baby.'

The father was originally sentence to a minimum of two years in jail. His sentence has been extended, with the court ruling the baby's crying does not reduce his moral culpability. The man's will not be eligible for parole until September 2017

However, during the appeal the Crown argued that there was not sufficient evidence to prove the child had been crying in the lead up to the assaults. 

The father had been home alone with the child on both occasions.  

In the judgement handed down on Friday, Justice Peter Garling said: 'The Crown, in my view, is correct to submit that the sentencing judge regarded this finding as lessening the respondent's moral culpability for the offence that occurred.

'His Honour's specific reference to the capacity of a parent to lash out in frustration 'when dealing with a crying baby', is a direct finding of fact that this is what occurred in these circumstances.

'This was an erroneous finding. The evidence did not permit that finding to be made.'

Justice Garling also ruled that the sentencing judge in 2013 had not taken into consideration the objective seriousness of the crime. 

As a result, the defendant was given a light sentence.

Justice Lucy McCallum and Justice Clifton Hoeben agreed his Justice Garling's ruling.

The father will be eligible for parole in September 2017. 

The child has not suffered any permanent disability after the attacks.  

Justice Garling also ruled that the sentencing judge in 2013 had lessened the respondent's moral culpability based on an erroenous finding. Justice Garling also found that the judge had not taken into consideration the objective seriousness of the crime
