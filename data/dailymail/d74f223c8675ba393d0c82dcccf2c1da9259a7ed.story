The meteorite that crashed on Russia was hit by an unidentified flying object causing it to explode and shatter over the Urals, it has been claimed.

The bizarre theory is based on analysis of blurry footage of the space rock as it streaked across morning sky above the city of Chelyabinsk.

U.F.O enthusiasts insist a small 'object' can be seen colliding with the meteorite on its trajectory through the atmosphere, despite the fact there were no reports of Russia launching missiles to down the celestial intruder, they claim.

The watchers have seized on the unexplained images and an online debate is now underway in Russia with claims that 'we were saved by a UFO', reported the Siberian Times.

The meteorite exploded in the atmosphere on 15 February with a force as great as 30 Hiroshima nuclear bombs, causing extensive damage in Chelyabinsk and injuring around 1,200 people, many from shattered glass.

Alien enthusiasts have have seized on the unexplained images as evidence that 'we were saved by a UFO'

Estimated by Nasa to have been 55ft-wide and with a weight of some 10,000 tons, the meteor is thought to have exploded above the Ural mountains with a force equivalent to about 500kilotons.

Nuclear installations in the Urals remained undamaged by the fallout.

'At first, we also believed that the Chelyabinsk meteorite was just an ordinary meteorite, a cosmic body,' said Alexander Komanev, coordinator for the Russian UFO community in Yekaterinburg.

But on at least three films of the space rock 'you can see how an object catches the meteorite', he said.

This minuscule oblong-shaped object "flies into it - and the meteorite explodes and falls'.

He stressed: 'Such a number of videos, made from different angles, leads us to believe that something has blown up the meteorite...'

He claimed that in the weeks before the meteorite, there was an upsurge in UFO sightings in the Urals, followed by none at all since the incident.

Proponents of the theory claim there was an upsurge in UFO sightings in the Urals, before the meteorite hit, followed by none at all since the incident

Separately in day time, similar objects were seen over Chelyabinsk, it is claimed.

On both occasions they moved across the sky, disappeared, and then returned.

Russia has called for major international efforts to develop the technology zap incoming space objects, but there is no suggestion any military strike was made at the meteorite on 15 February which was not spotted in advance.

Experts said the meteor that left a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, weighed around 100,000 tonnes  and measured 55 feet in diameter

The 100,000 tonne rock, measuring 
around 55 feet in diameter, created a huge hole in a frozen lake when it
 crashed into the ground.

Scientists have found more than 50 tiny fragments of the meteor, allowing them to uncover information about its contents.

Divers are believed to have located several lumps of the meteorite in Lake Chebarkul in Chelyabinsk region.
