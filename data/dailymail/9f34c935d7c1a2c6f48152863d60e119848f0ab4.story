A 15-year-old north Florida girl who authorities say fatally shot her 16-year-old brother after years of abuse at home pleaded no contest on Thursday to felony burglary and will receive probation and counseling.

The girl's probation will last until her 19th birthday, and is contingent upon her participation in counseling, and testifying truthfully in the case of her parents, who face felony child abuse charges, Third Circuit State Attorney Jeff Siegmeister said.

'This child has the best chance at a normal adult life by receiving the therapy and education she needs and residing in the setting of her current foster home,' he said.

A 15-year-old girl (left) and her 11-year-old sister (right) have not been charged with murder after the eldest girl fatally shot her 16-year-old brother at their Florida home in January. The eldest will receive probation and counseling

The girl and her 11-year-old sister were initially arrested on suspicion of murder after the January 5 shooting in Lake City. No charges were filed against the younger sister.

The names of the members of the family are not being released because of the girls' ages and because of abuse allegations.

On January 5, the girls and their three-year-old sister were left by their parents in the care of their brother. The parents were away on a work-related truck drive.

Police say the brother locked the elder sister in her room, but when he fell asleep, she persuaded the 11-year-old to let her out so she could shower.

The boy, 16, was killed by his sister, 15, on January 5 after she escaped the room her brother had locked her in and shot him in the neck

The older sister asked her younger sister to keep watch as she went outside and cut out the air conditioner of her parents' locked bedroom window to retrieve a pistol.

The girl asked her younger sister to take their three-year-old sister and hide in a closet before she shot her brother in the neck as he slept, police said.

The two older girls fled the house, leaving the toddler behind.

They were later found by police outside a Dollar General store after the younger girl called a friend saying she needed a ride.

Documents show that the elder girl suffered years of abuse, including being locked in her bedroom for days regularly with only a blanket and a bucket to use the bathroom.

The longest they kept the girl locked in her room was 20 consecutive days, the father told police.

In the room, police found only a blanket and a bucket filled with urine in the closet, allegedly a punishment because the teenage girl was stealing and talking back.

Letters from the parents asking her why she should be let out of that room were also found in the police investigation.

'It was learned that (the 15-year-old girl) has made past attempts at ending her life but neither law enforcement nor (emergency management services) was notified,' police wrote in their January report.

In addition, documents showed that she had been sexually abused by her uncle, who was convicted in 2010.

The uncle was arrested in December 2010 on sex charges after his wife found a USB with movie clips of him and the 15-year-old engaged in sexual acts. It had been going on for some time.

According to police documents, his wife reported seeing a video clip of the girl sitting down and a man with his penis out, standing behind her.

He then had oral sex with the underage girl, while she made noises, the wife told police.

The victim later told investigators that she did not want it to happen.

The uncle had told her to 'suck on his thingy' and that 'they were to be private and not to tell anyone no matter what'.

The abuse had been going on 'for a long time', according to the police report, and the videotaping for about a year.

The parents have been charged with child neglect and failing to supervise. The girls' mother told police that they often locked the 15-year-old girl up when she misbehaved

The uncle was convicted and is on the registered sex offender's list.

Authorities also said the children's mother had discovered the siblings having sex in 2011.

The mother reported to police that she heard noises coming from the bedroom and found the teenage boy having sex with his sister, who is a year younger.

The mother told police that she separated the siblings and asked them what happened.

The girl told her mother that she did not want to 'do it' with her brother but he put pressure on her. She also referenced the earlier abuse by her uncle.

After an investigation by child welfare officials, no one was charged.

Her parents had also removed her from school, documents show.

Siegmeister said all of the family's history and circumstances were taken into consideration in the decision not to pursue more serious criminal charges.

'This case is a tragedy to all those involved: the deceased, the two arrested children, as well as their 3-year-old sister who has been separated from them both. Further incarceration... serves no deterrent, rehabilitative nor other societal interest,' he said.
