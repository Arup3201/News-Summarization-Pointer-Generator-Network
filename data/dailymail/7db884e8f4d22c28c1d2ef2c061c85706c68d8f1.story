A billboard celebrating the ‘remarkable women’ at a Canadian university appeared to forget one crucial element – pictures of the women in question that they were celebrating.

The advert is part of a larger campaign at Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and shows three men in suits and ties standing below text that reads: ‘We celebrate remarkable women on the Riva Spatz Women’s Wall of Honour. Join us.’

The commercial was intended to raise awareness of the Wall of Honor, but many are saying that it completely missed its mark, not only for its questionable design but because of its content.

A man's world: This billboard in downtown Halifax advertises the 'remarkable women' of Mount Saint Vincent University's Riva Spatz Women's Wall of Honour - but pictures three men

Kelly Gallant, the university’s associate vice-president of communications and marketing, told MailOnline on Thursday that no offense was meant.

'Up to this point, most of the people who have been donating have been those with a direct connection to the university, and mostly women,' she explained.

'It’s a localized campaign and has the full support of our leadership team at our university. We were looking to reach men and women.'

Asked what she thought of those who are perhaps puzzled by the conspicuous lack of women on the billboard, she responded: 'If it raises attention to people in terms of what we want to do for honouring women, then I think that’s a good thing,' adding that there are additional parts of the campaign on their website featuring women.

The billboard, which is located in downtown Halifax on Barrington St, has caused plenty of raised eyebrows after it was first reported by CBC News.

Twitter user Kathryn Walsh tweeted earlier this week: ‘I see their billboard on Barrington every morning on the way to HFX and I always think “what? Why would they do that?”’

Digital presence: The website for the advertising campaign features the same image of the three men, but also includes some of the women honored

And women’s blog Feministe not only criticized the content itself, but the design, writing: ‘It’s plug-ugly. I mean, hello to some art direction,’ adding that the text-heavy advert could cause problems to those driving by. 

They added: ‘There are no women on (the billboard). It’s a “women’s wall” ad with three dudes and not a single woman anywhere.’

The university’s campaign to honor women seeks $1,200 donations that ensure a woman’s name is included in the wall, which is scheduled to be erected outside of the Margaret Norrie McCain Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Research.

And for a donation of $250,000 and up, an honoree’s name and image will be embroidered on a banner that will be displayed in the building’s atrium.

The complex is slated to open in winter of 2014.

According to the Chronicle Herald, the billboard shows Rob Batherson, senior vice president of public affairs at advertising company Colour, as well as Paul Kent, president and CEO of the Greater Halifax Partnership, and former provincial Liberal leader Danny Graham.
