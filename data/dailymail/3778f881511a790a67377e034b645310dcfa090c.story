Jean-Eric Vergne has been named as Ferrari's new test driver.

The 24-year-old Frenchman had driven in Formula One with Toro Rosso for the past three seasons but was not given a drive for next year.

Vergne said: 'I feel very honoured to be joining the Ferrari family and becoming a part of the most prestigious team in the history of Formula One.

'The objective is a unanimous one and that is to help the Scuderia get back to the top step of the podium.

'Having had two years working in the simulator for a top F1 team and three years racing with Toro Rosso, my experience will add to the great efforts that are currently being made in order to get the team back to its winning ways.

'I look forward to fulfilling my dream in becoming a member of Scuderia Ferrari and having the Tifosi behind me every step of the way.'

Vergne was axed by Toro Rosso despite claiming 22 points last season

Ferrari had a hugely disappointing season by their standards, failing to win a race and finishing only fourth in the constructors' championship.

Fernando Alonso, who finished sixth in the drivers' standings, has left to join McLaren with four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel replacing him.

Scuderia Ferrari Director General and Team Principal, Maurizio Arrivabene said of Vergne: 'On behalf of the entire team, I welcome Jean-Eric, who I'm sure will make an important contribution to our development work in the simulator.

'He will fit into a programme aimed at improving important areas, invigorating and strengthening an already strong and capable group of professionals.'
