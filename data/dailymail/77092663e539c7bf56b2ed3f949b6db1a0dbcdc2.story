Yaya Toure has expressed remorse for the victims and their families of last week's Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris.

Manchester City midfielder Toure, a practising Muslim, apologised on behalf of his religion and admitted he was 'afraid of what is going to happen.'

Twelve people were killed when two gunmen entered French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo's offices in Paris.

Yaya Toure speaks after he was named African Player of the Year in Nigeria at the beginning of January 

Toure told CNN World Sport: 'When you hear something like that it's a big disappointment.

'I feel very sorry for the families – they lost their friend, or lost their father, or their husband.

'I have a friend in Paris. As a Muslim I have a friend and they are Muslim as well and I'm afraid what is going to happen.

'Everybody has his point of view – everybody has something to say about it.

'It's a newspaper trying to say something. But sometimes it hurts people you know.'

Toure has scored nine goals in 26 appearances for Manchester City this season 

Four-time African Player of the Year Toure has scored nine goals in 26 appearances for City this season.

The Ivorian was disappointed with the magazine's depiction of the prophet Mohammed but understands the importance of the freedom of speech.

He said: 'As a Muslim I always believe in the way people can say what they want to say.

'For me the most important thing is that we know that sometimes the newspaper is doing a lot and they're trying to do too much, and sometimes they do it without respect.'

'I heard that when they were writing things like that in the cartoon there were a couple of people coming around and try to tell them to stop. Afterwards we've heard about these people doing horrible things.'
