A ruthless Mexican girl gang is accused of using their prettiest member to lure men to secluded spots where a female body builder would put him in a headlock so the others could beat him up and rob him.

Mexican police  arrested the gang of six women who they suspect targeted dozens of men, many of whom were thought to have been too ashamed to report the matter to police.

The gang, operating in the popular tourist city Cancun in the southeast Mexican state of Quintana Roo, used attractive Maria Sierra, 20, who targeted single men or at the most pairs of men to attack. 

Heavy mob: This gang of six women allegedly lured dozens of men to secluded spots where they would be beaten and robbed

After flirting with them she would either lure them alone or with one of the other women to her home, but in reality she just wanted to take them to a secluded spot where the other members of the gang were waiting.

Then led by burly Yesenia Lara, 30, who would put them in a headlock, they would then get a beating by the other women and be robbed of their wallets, mobile phones and other valuables.

Police say that Yesenia lifts weights at a local gym in order to get the strength to take on the men. Another of the women Griselda Naranjo, 19, was a former female boxer and could knock victims out with a single punch.

The police spokesman said: 'The people may have been cautious when going off with the young woman, but they were not suspicious when they walked past the other women as they just didn't expect that females would attack them.'

He said that the gang counted on the fact that local men were too embarrassed at admitting being robbed by the women, and said nothing at all about the circumstances of the robbery, allowing the women to escape.

However they were finally caught when they targeted a tourist, who not only raised the alarm but told police he thought they were all members of an organised gang and gave them clear descriptions of all six.

Police were able to arrest all of them, dubbed the honey trap gang in local media, and discovered that there were many more victims after interviewing all of the women separately.

The other members of the gang were Andrea Martinez, 28, Yesenia Lopez, 21, and Roxana Maldonado 19.
