A Russian porn star broke both her legs as she escaped two thugs who brutally raped and assaulted her after luring her to their flat with a business deal.

The 22-year-old adult actress had entered the flat after being invited by the two men to discuss a possible new production, but was attacked and jumped out of a window to get away.

The woman, who works under the stage name Lola Taylor, was found bleeding and with torn clothes by a man walking his dog in Yasenovo, Moscow.

Attacked: Russian porn star Lola Taylor escaped her rapists by jumping out of a window on the third floor

'Lola Taylor' had agreed to meet the men for an interview to talk about the film, but after she arrived, the men set upon her and proceeded to rape her in an ordeal that lasted several hours.

She eventually managed to escape by jumping from the third floor balcony where she was found by stunned neighbour, Blasius Vinogradov, 54, walking his dog.

He told local TV: 'I was just minding my own business when this blonde girl with torn clothes and bleeding mouth hit the ground.

'She was unconscious and it was clear she had broken both her legs.

'I didn't know what was going on, but I knew it wasn't good and immediately phoned the police and an ambulance.'

The woman, who is a former librarian, was taken to the emergency room of a nearby hospital.

A police spokesman said: 'She was in a bad way and had been subjected to hours of rape and abuse prior to the fall.

'When we arrested the men they denied it until we found evidence of the crime across the apartment.

'They had tried clearing up the blood but had not yet disposed of her ripped clothing.'

The two men, Dmitry Kosenkov, 30 and Maksim Pilipenko, 33, have been arrested and face up to 30 years in jail. 

The two men were ordered to be detained for three months before the trial.
