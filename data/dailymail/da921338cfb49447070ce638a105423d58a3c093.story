For the last seven years, Rick and Cindy Krlich claim they've been the target of 'terrorist honkers'. 

The Hubbard, Ohio couple say motorists driving past their home have beeped more than 5,000 times out of revenge for trying to buy a neighbor's house in 2007.

The married couple allege the honking, in addition to ongoing harassment and stalking, has ruined their lives and are suing 40 of their neighbors, including some of the small town's most prominent citizens.

However their neighbors deny there's a 'small town terrorist campaign' against the Krlichs and insist the litigious pair are the ones disturbing the peace.

Victims? Long-time Hubbard, Ohio, residents Rick and Cindy Krlich claim they're the subject of a honking harassment campaign and have been beeped 5,000 times over seven years following a property dispute

The house that 'started it all'

'The Clemente House': The Krlichs say the honking started when they tried to buy their neighbors' house (pictured) in 2007

Rick Krlich told ABC News the trouble began in 2007 when he tried to buy the house next door.

Krlich filed a lawsuit to stop John Clemente from buying the house while it was in probate court, even though it had been in the 
Clemente family for several generations.

The lawsuit failed and the Clementes moved in, but Krlich claims the action annoyed John Clemente who at the time was 
the town fire chief. 

Krlich
 contends John Clemente and his family retaliated by organizing a 'vast 
conspiracy' of horn honking, even getting senior figures and law 
enforcers in the town to join in.

Krlich
has gathered mountains of 'evidence', including surveillance footage of cars driving past honking their horns, to prove that he's being harassed.

He also maintains a website stating his case in detail and documenting hundreds of his complaints to police. On the site, he calls the alleged honking campaign 'small town terrorism'.

The Clementes

John and Marlene Clemente, who are among the 40 defendants being sued by Krlich is suing, deny they instigated the honking.

According
 to John Clemente, his son’s girlfriend and some of her friends would 
blow the horn just to say goodbye after a visit.

He said while a fire truck and other Hubbard residents have been caught on camera honking the horn outside of the Krlich house, Rick Krlich brought it on himself.

'Why
 wouldn’t you be against him … and what he is doing to everybody?' John 
Clemente told ABC News. 'Do you realize he has got 700 cases going to 
court?'

Marlene Clemente added: 'If you beep your horn one time, 
he’ll take you to court. Just a regular
 beep or just to beep at the neighbors across the street, he’ll take you
 to court.'

Gathering evidence

Information gathering: Rick Krlich has collected mountains of evidence (pictured), including surveillance of vehicles honking based, which he has forwarded to police and used in his lawsuits

Standing up for himself: Rick Krlich (pictured) maintains a slick website stating his case in detail and providing video of drivers honking, which he claims is part of a 'small town terrorism campaign'

Evidence: Rick Krlich has filmed vehicles going past his home and honking over several years. He has compiled the footage and uploaded it to a YouTube account to prove his case

On Krlich’s website, he says that he has filed 'hundreds' of police reports against honkers.

'Some of the reports led to charges being filed,' he wrote. 'Others were ignored, and many were used as evidence in hearings that led to the issuance of civil protection orders against the people who tormented the Krlich’s morning, noon, and night.'

Krlich also listed civil protection orders he took out against more than a dozen of his neighbors for stalking.

The orders prohibit their targets from 'committing acts of abuse or threats of abuse' against the couple.

It is not clear why the Krlich's have not moved house.
