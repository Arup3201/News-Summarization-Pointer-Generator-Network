A teenager turned detective to find his stolen bike by following the tyre tracks through the snow for four miles.

Robert Chambers, 16, had already had two bikes stolen in the last year so when a £2,500 replacement locked up outside his home went missing in January he set off on foot, a court heard.

He followed the distinctive tyre marks through several streets in North Shields, North Tyneside, and across a playing field before they disappeared.

Robert Chambers, 16, from North Shields, turned DIY detective to track down the bungling thief who stole his £2,500 bicycle

His father Ian then drove him around until they spotted the tyre marks again.

They led to the Wallsend home of Lee Barker, 19, North Tyneside magistrates were told.

Prosecutor Adrian Ions said: 'Police were called and they recovered the bike from the address.'

Barker pleaded guilty to the theft on Friday.

Robert, 16, reunited with his beloved bike (left)  and (right) bike thief Lee Barker, 19, who stole the £2,500 cycle from outside the teenager's home

He was fined a total of £263, including £30 compensation

In mitigation Kate Matthews said: 'He had been to a party. He did intend to get a taxi home but ran out of money. So he started to walk home.

'It started snowing. Stupidly, he took the opportunity to take the bike home.'

After the hearing, Robert’s mother Hailey Molloy, 35, said: 'Robert did his best to get his bike back and I’m really proud of him for what he did.'
