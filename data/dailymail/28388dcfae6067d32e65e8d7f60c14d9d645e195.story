The father of a man who drowned in  3ft of water after emergency crews were ordered not to rescue him has hit out at health and safety rules that ‘hinder’ the 999 services.

David Burgess, whose son Simon lay floating face down in a lake for more than half an hour while firemen, police and paramedics watched, said it was impossible to ‘eliminate all risk’ for the emergency services.

A fire crew claimed safety rules stopped them from going more than ‘ankle-deep’ into the water after they decided the charity worker was ‘already deceased’.

PC Tony Jones, left, who offered to dive into the lake, was ordered not to by station watch manager Tony Nicholls, who thought Mr Burgess was already dead and the water was too deep

Critical: David Burgess arrives at the inquest yesterday heard there was a
‘slim’ chance his son could have survived if he had been brought out
of the water quickly

And a policeman and a paramedic who both volunteered to jump in were given orders not to do so by a fire station watch manager.

Yesterday an inquest heard there was a
‘slim’ chance Mr Burgess could have survived if he had been brought out
of the water quickly.

Afterwards his father said: ‘We 
appreciate that the emergency services operate in difficult situations 
where split second decisions are required, but it is also clear that 
they are often hindered by rules and procedures that attempt to 
eliminate all risk when by its very nature effective emergency work will
always have some risk.’

Tragedy: Simon Burgess, right, feeds the swans at the lake in Gosport, Hampshire, where he drowned a few months after this picture was taken

His criticisms came as the coroner 
demanded the fire, police and ambulance services improve their training 
to prevent a future tragedy.

Coroner David Horsley ruled the 
41-year-old’s death was an accident on the balance of probabilities, but
said there was a chance ‘albeit a slim one’ he could have been saved 
had the emergency services intervened sooner.

He called for a review of ‘protocol’ 
to ‘get the best possible guidance for situations like this where a life
may hang in the balance’.

'Too deep': Emergency services are pictured here just after they recovered the body from the lake. They had refused to get into the water until specialists arrived because it was 'too deep'

Wading out: Following the delay, a pair of firefighters make their way into the centre of the waist-deep lake to attempt to rescue Mr Burgess

Probe: Police cordon off the scene following the tragedy. The inquest heard today there was a 28 minute delay before Mr Burgess was pulled from the water after the first phone call was made

Mr Horsley said: ‘I’ve considered 
whether an earlier recovery of Simon could have saved his life. I 
believe there might have been a chance, albeit a slim one, that the 
outcome might have been different if there was a speedier recovery.

‘The delay in the recovery has not 
been a significant factor in this tragic case. The death was down to an 
accident, Simon was doing something he did every day and had an 
epileptic seizure.’

Mr Burgess had been feeding swans at 
the Walpole Park lake in Gosport, Hampshire, on March 10 last year. He 
went into the water to retrieve a plastic bag and fell unconscious after
having a fit, the coroner ruled.

Firemen arrived within five minutes 
but refused to go into the water because it was above ‘ankle deep’. 
Instead, they waited for a specialist water rescue team to arrive.

Although fire crews were sent almost immediately it was 35 minutes before Simon Burgess was recovered from the water.

Pathologist Dr Bret Lockyer said if he had been pulled out sooner there was a 'slim chance' he could have been saved.

The timeline on March 10 was as follows:

12.17pm: Gillian Hughes rings the Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service control room and speaks to Deborah Coles, the control room manager.

12.18pm: Fire engine, water rescue trained crew and a water support unit are sent. Police, ambulance and coastguard are also dispatched.

12.20pm: Fire crews arrive.

12.25pm: They
report to their control room a male is floating down in the water. 
Around this time, Gillian Hughes says they refused to go into the water.

12.31pm: The water support unit arrive.

12.46pm: They request that the press officer attends the scene.

12.52pm: Firefighters report to their control room that Simon Burgess is recovered from the water.

12.58pm: He is taken to hospital.

1.42pm: He is formally pronounced dead.

Speaking after the inquest, Mr 
Burgess’s father said: ‘We will never know if Simon could have been 
saved if he had been pulled from the water as soon as the emergency 
services arrived on the scene or if it was already too late for him.’

Fire station watch manager Tony 
Nicholls took the decision that Mr Burgess was already dead so the 
operation was a body recovery, rather than a rescue. PC Tony Jones, who 
volunteered to go in, told the inquest: ‘When I spoke to witnesses and 
found out the body hadn’t been there long I told my sergeant I was 
willing to go into the water.

'He authorised me to do so and I took off 
my body armour but Mr Nicholls advised me strongly not to go in.

‘I said I would go in anyway and 
asked if I could borrow his life jacket but he said “No”, but I was 
going to do it regardless. It didn’t sit right with me that no one was 
going to get the body or assist the person in the water. The control 
room was informed I was going in and they sent a message that under no 
circumstances could I go in.’

Mr Nicholls told the inquest: ‘There 
were no obvious signs of life so I made an assessment it was a body 
retrieval and not a rescue. If there had been signs of life we would 
have gone in immediately.’

Delivering his verdict, Mr Horsley, 
said he was ‘concerned’ by the assessment of the fire service and their 
lack of training.

A spokesman for Hampshire Fire and Rescue said: ‘Our 
officers and firefighters make difficult decisions and professional 
judgments every day, whatever the situation or incident.

‘Their actions are based on training,
balanced judgment and assessments based on the information and 
circumstances they are faced with in a dynamic situation.’

Last year a coroner said emergency 
services should be prepared to ‘risk their lives’ for the public. At the
inquest on the victims of the Cumbrian gun massacre, David Roberts said
it was disturbing that paramedics were prevented from reaching the 
injured because of red tape which cost vital minutes.

Firefighters need to be trained to water rescue level two if they want to go into a three foot deep lake, the inquest heard.

The rules are set down in the firefighters own health and safety policy document LSO 34.

Under the wording of the rules, rescuers trained to level one can only go into water that is ankle deep.

During the two-day level two training session firefighters have to go to lectures, conduct exercises and take part in practical demonstrations.

Although one of the first responders was 'level two' trained he did not have appropriate equipment with him - so Mr Burgess was left in the water, the inquest was told.

The Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service website sets out the full details of the level two course - as set out below:
