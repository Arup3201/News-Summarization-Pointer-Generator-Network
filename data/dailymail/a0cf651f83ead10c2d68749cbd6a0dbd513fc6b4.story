They were the louts of yesteryear, banned from the pubs of a city in the early 20th century after flouting strict public drinking laws.

Now an Edwardian-era book of police mugshots depicting dozens of Dundee citizens banned from drinking houses is set to go under the hammer.

Anyone convicted under the Inebriates Act of 1898 three times in the space of 12 months faced being added to the book.

'Wants teeth in the upper jaw': Jane Swaddel, aka Jane Williamson, a factory worker, was the oldest person listed in the book aged 63

Descriptions: Jane Swaddel was a 63-year-old woman standing just over 5ft tall, who had dark brown hair and grey eyes

Mugshot: Alice Roony, 54, who lived at the Overgate in the city and was a pedlar. She was banned from Dundee's pubs for flouting strict public drinking laws

Child: The youngest in the book was 16-year-old Margaret Devannah who lived on Seagate and worked at Queen Victoria Works

Their picture and description would then be circulated around the city's bars and clubs.

Those
 pictured could then be fined up to 40 shillings if they tried to buy 
alcohol again - and landlords could be fined up to £20 for serving them.

The
 pages of the book describe offenders with names, addresses,  
workplaces, a description and space for peculiarities and marks to be 
noted.

Jane Swaddel, aka Jane Williamson, a factory worker, was the oldest person listed in the book aged 63.

No drinking: Thomas Malloch of Blackness Road worked as a labourer. His picture and description was circulated around the city's bars and clubs

Barred: John Boyd, 46, was listed after being found in a state of intoxication and incapable of taking care of himself, and not under the care of a suitable person

Likeness document: John Boyd was described as standing 5ft 4in, with dark brown hair and brown hair - and with a 'left eye awanting', i.e. missing

It
 was noted that she 'wants teeth in the upper jaw' and was added to the 
book after being convicted under the Licensing (Scotland) Act in March 
1905.

John Boyd, 46, was 
listed after being found in a state of intoxication and incapable of 
taking care of himself, and not under the care of a suitable person.

He was convicted at the Police Court in Dundee and was described as of proportionate build with fresh complexion.

However, officers noted under peculiarities that the unemployed fish dealer's left eye was missing.

Under the hammer: Steven Dewar, of auctioneers Curr and Dewar, said it was 'quite an unusual lot - I've never seen anything quite like it'

In detail: The banning order signed by chief constable W Dewar, who is no relation to auctioneers Curr and Dewar

Auctioneers Curr and Dewar said the 
book was being put up for auction by a landlord who ran a pub on the 
site of the current Bissell's Bar in Dundee.

Licensing was ﬁrst introduced to Scotland in 1756, some two centuries later than in England and Wales.

Temperance societies had been set up in the Victorian era to combat the problem of binge drinking, and they were initially made up of people who pledged abstinence from alcohol.

One of the most well-known of these groups was Band of Hope - known today as Hope UK - which was established in Leeds in 1847.

As support grew, the Christian charity’s estimated membership in 1897 was at 3.2million, with Queen Victoria its patron.

Two years later, a survey in Liverpool found 55 per cent of children born to drunken mothers died before reaching the age of two.

As the 20th century began, there were various reforms which saw shopkeepers banned from selling intoxicating liquors to children under 14, except in corked and sealed containers.

And the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1903 established general opening hours for pubs of 8am to 11pm, as well as Sunday closing.

Steven Dewar, of Curr and Dewar, said: 'It's quite an unusual lot - I've never seen anything quite like it.

'It's a book that would have been handed to publicans by the police.

‘It's
 naming and giving a mugshot of people who have been convicted of being 
intoxicated and incapable of taking care of themselves.

‘It
 says if they try to buy liquor to report them to police to be dealt 
with. This copy was given to a publican called John Kennedy of Polepark 
Road.

‘It gives all the details of the person as well as their picture - and their “peculiarities”.

'It is signed by the constable in charge and there are about 40 of them in all. It's quite a unique piece - it's got a history. '

He added: 'It's quite fascinating really - a real snapshot of the time it comes from. It was very much a recognised thing at the time.

'But I suppose it's the kind of thing you wouldn't be allowed to do now in case it contravened someone's privacy.’

‘It covers a big age range - from 16 to 63 - and surprisingly is mostly females. There's also a strong Irish contingent amongst it.'

Many Irish immigrants made their way to the east coast of Scotland in the 1840s and 1850s, with a large female Irish community that established itself in Dundee.

Respect MP George Galloway was born in Dundee a century later in 1954 to his teetotal parents - a Scottish trade unionist father and Irish republican mother.

Mr Dewar added of the mugshots in the book: ‘These are all hard working people living at a hard time - jute mill workers and factory workers.

‘We've only valued it at £50 to £100 but that's just because we've no idea what it will be worth to someone.’

Dundee is often labelled as being the home of 'jute, jam and journalism', thanks to the prominence of each trade in its industrial heritage. Jute is a fibre used for making rope or woven into matting. In the late 19th century, there were more than 50,000 workers employed across 60 jute mills in the city.

On jam, it was said that Dundee woman Janet Keillor discovered marmalade in the late 1700s. And on journalism, DC Thomson, which publishes The Beano, was established in Dundee in 1905.

The mugshots book will go under the hammer at Curr and Dewar auctioneers in Dundee next Tuesday at 10am.
