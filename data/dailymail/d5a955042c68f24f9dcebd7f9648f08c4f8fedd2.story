There was a punch of the air, a handshake with Brendan Rodgers then a cursory acknowledgement of the fans in the Milburn Stand before Alan Pardew scurried down the tunnel.

Hurrying for sanctuary is something Pardew has had to do a lot of in recent months, as Newcastle supporters aimed their venom at him, enraged by the erratic performances and confidence-sapping results of his team.

On this occasion Pardew should have hung around. As acclaim rang around St James Park after a doughty win over Liverpool, secured by Ayoze Perez, Newcastle’s manager would have appreciated he is no longer public enemy No 1.

Proof of that was all around. In the East Stand, some fans unfurled a banner reading ‘backpardew.com’ while before kick-off, a lone supporter, dressed as the Grim Reaper, held a placard proclaiming ‘Pardew – Back from the Dead’.

‘It is Halloween,’ said Pardew with a wry smile. ‘Bobby Robson had some dark days here, don’t worry about that. If you are Newcastle manager, it is not all gin and tonics and aperitifs. There will be rough days. I kept saying that we have good spirit and good talent.

‘I’m not saying I saw the wins coming but I knew there was talent. Our fans are brilliant. It will be fantastic in the town tonight. I might even go in myself — the first time for a while. That is what this city is about. It loves football.

‘When it does not go well they let you know and when it is going well, they let you know. You take the good with the bad.’

And, at this moment, it is good. That goal from Perez ensured a week that began with a victory at White Hart Lane, followed by a win over Manchester City in the Capital One Cup, ended as it started. Newcastle have momentum and Pardew knows it.

But what of Liverpool? Their campaign of false starts shows no signs of turning and if Rodgers was looking for a jolt of confidence before Tuesday’s daunting trip to Madrid, he was left bitterly disappointed. The problems he has are no closer to being solved.

‘I didn’t think we deserved to lose but didn’t do enough to win it,’ he observed. ‘We had enough of the ball but just lacked that bit of creativity and invention in the final third. But we made a mistake and that has unfortunately cost us the game. That is the biggest disappointment.’

This is the highest-scoring contest in the history of the Premier League but you would never have guessed that following a turgid opening 45 minutes. A spark was missing from both sides and their respective movement was, at best, pedestrian.

On the touchline, in their technical areas, Pardew and Rodgers fidgeted with frustration as moves broke down following sloppy passes or lacked the wit to cause problems. Of the two, Rodgers was more unhappy, turning to his assistant regularly to express his impatience.

Rodgers was almost tearing his hair out in the 37th minute when Newcastle had the first big chance. Had they scored, it would again have been down to defensive deficiencies, as goalkeeper Simon Mignolet came for a corner and got nowhere near it, presenting a chance to Papiss Cisse.

Liverpool had a reprieve, though, as Glen Johnson was in the right place to cover Mignolet and headed Cisse’s tame shot off the line and away from danger. Aside from a couple of half-hearted penalty shouts, that was as good as it got for Newcastle before the break.

The visitors, perhaps, should have gone in with a lead. In the 40th minute, a typically precise corner from Steven Gerrard found Martin Skrtel but, having escaped Steven Taylor’s attentions, he planted his header the wrong side of a post.

                               MINS PLD    KM    MILES

Newcastle                                 113.4   70.5

Mark Noble                  90            12.2     7.6 

Jack Colback               90            11.9     7.4

Daryl Janmaat             90            10.9     6.8

Liverpool                                  107.2    66.6

Jordan Henderson       90            11.1      6.9

Steven Gerrard            90            11.1      6.9

Alberto Moreno            90            10.8      6.7

An advantage at that stage would not have been merited but, belatedly, Liverpool emerged with more intent after the restart and twice in the opening five minutes Mario Balotelli made Tim Krul work, first with a free-kick, then with a curling shot.

Once Balotelli got involved, Liverpool looked slightly more efficient but, as has been the case so often this season, they could not sustain their good play for a prolonged spell and when they began to lose direction, Newcastle sensed an opportunity.

With the home crowd turning up the noise, Newcastle began to press and in the 71st minute, they were rewarded. At the heart of it was the imperious Sissoko — who, Rodgers said, should have been sent off for a foul on Joe Allen — driving into Liverpool’s penalty area, spreading panic on the way.

Sissoko looked to free Remy Cabella but as Alberto Moreno tried to stab away the danger, he succeeded only in turning the ball into Perez’s path and he gleefully swept his opportunity beyond the helpless Mignolet.

One goal should have become two in the next attack as Newcastle sped forward after Liverpool lost possession. Perez and Cabella ended up in a position where they up against Johnson but Mignolet kept Liverpool in the game, saving with his feet when Cabella seemed certain to score.

His miss did not matter. Liverpool lacked the gumption to stage a grandstand finish and, ultimately, Newcastle saw the contest out comfortably and the celebrations were typically noisy. Pardew, however, chose to enjoy the moment on his own.

‘I would like to think I am coming out of this a better manager,’ said Pardew. ‘It has been interesting and educational.

‘It tests you, this football club, on a number of levels. But this was a great day for us.’
