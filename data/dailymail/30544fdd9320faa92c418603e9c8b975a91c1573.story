Incredible gift: Garbage man Miguel Sanchez, got out of his trash truck to give a large plastic toy version of his vehicle to garbage truck fanatic Daniel Mulligan

His hero: Mr Sanchez is Daniel's 'favourite' garbage man, his mother revealed, and the little boy was left speechless after the kind gesture

Big fan: Daniel, aged five, used to be afraid of garbage trucks, but now trash day is his favorite day of the week and Mr Sanchez is his hero driver

The video was sent to the organization Autism Speaks who shared the touching moment on Facebook and YouTube.

The video shows Mr Sanchez as he pulls up outside the family home, to Daniel's absolute delight.

He asks Daniel's mother Robin Newberger if he can give the boy a present.

'He wants to give you something — a present,' Ms Newberger can be heard saying to Daniel.

Mr Sanchez gets out of the truck and walks over to Daniel with a bag, containing a large plastic truck.

The garbage man steps out of the truck and asks Daniel's family if he is allowed to give the boy a gift

'You’re not going to believe it, but he had one like this and it broke,' said the boy's mother.

Daniel was so overcome by the gift that all he could say was a quiet, 'thank you.'

'One man, one moment, touching the life of an autistic child...our hearts are overflowing,' Ms Newberger wrote in a Facebook message to Autism Speaks.

She explains how her son Daniel used to be afraid of trash pickup, but that his fear grew into a love of trash day.

'He waits all week for Monday morning pickup. He knows exactly which cans are being picked up each week, and Sundays are special for him when he takes the cans out with his dad,'she said.

'Our recycle man, known only to us as Manuel, is his favorite. He always has a big smile for Daniel, who is faithfully waiting for him every Monday. To him, trash pickup is like a symphony. He synchronizes his hand movements with the truck,' Ms Newberger wrote.

Going viral: The video has been seen more than 700,000 times and the link on Autism Speak's Facebook page has been shared by thousands

Newberger was so moved by Sanchez's 
kindness that she started her own Facebook page called 'The Gift' for 
parents of children with autism to share heart warming stories.

Sanchez
 is an employee of E.J Harrison and Sons who released a statement saying
 that Sanchez bought the gift with his own money, independent of the 
company.

They were 
proud of their employee and said, 'Harrison Industries is so proud of 
our Ojai residential route driver Manuel Sanchez,' the statement read. 
'Little did Manuel know that his simple act of kindness would touch tens
 of thousands of people across the nation – and the world.'

The company has said that it is an 'honour'  to have Sanchez as an employee.

Sanchez
 has said that he's embarrassed by all the attention he's received and 
that he wishes he wrapped the present before giving it to the boy.

'Manuel,
 you deserve the attention you are receiving,” the statement read. “You 
lifted the spirits of people around the world,' read a statement from 
the company.

'That little boy is so special, and he will steal anybody’s heart as soon as you see him, 'Sanchez said in the statement.

'I didn’t know what he has, but there’s something very special about him.'
