Sergei Rebrov has issued Arsenal with a 'hands-off' warning amid talk the Gunners are keen to sign Dynamo Kiev defender Aleksandar Dragovic.

The former Tottenham and West Ham striker returns to England as a manager with his Dynamo Kiev side taking on Everton in the Europa League on Thursday night.

Reports suggest Arsene Wenger is keen on Austria international Dragovic but Rebrov said: 'You are asking about one of the best players in my team and I don't want to lose this player.

Rebrov was talking ahead of Dynamo Kiev's Europa League last 16 first leg tie against Everton 

'He is a top-class player and I hope he will stay with us.'

Rebrov flopped during a five-year spell in England after moving to Spurs in an £11million deal back in 2000.

However, despite struggling in the Premier League, Rebrov is still a keen observer of the English top-flight and is pleased to see how Tottenham are performing.

The former Ukraine international - who scored over 100 goals during two spells with Kiev - also praised young Tottenham striker Harry Kane who has scored 16 Premier League goals for Mauricio Pochettino's side this term.

Asked if he still takes an interest in his former clubs, the Dynamo Kiev manager said: 'Of course I am still following Tottenham, West Ham - all the teams I played for.

'I'm glad because I think Tottenham are getting better. Harry Kane is a very good forward, scoring not just lots but some very important goals.

'I'm also very pleased for my good friend Tim Sherwood (his former Tottenham team-mate), who is doing a good job as Aston Villa manager.

Rebrov still looks out for his former club and is pleased with how Tottenham and Harry Kane are performing 

'The Premier League is always interesting for me, whether you are playing in it or just watching it. And it is a very hard league.' 

Meanwhile, Everton will be looking for a positive result in the first leg of their Europa League last 16 tie  having endured a disappointing domestic season.

Roberto Martinez's side are currently 14th in the Premier League, six points above the drop zone, but have impressed in Europe and beat Swiss side Young Boys 7-2 on aggregate in the previous round.
