A doctor treating her has been reported as saying she was showing signs of recovery.

According to The Olive Press a spokesperson for the duchess' charitable foundation said: 'She had suffered a stomach virus a few days earlier but had recovered from it. Now she has pneumonia. At her age, one thing leads to another.

'She is weak. We are worried because we love her very much.'

The duchess, whose fortune is estimated to be worth in excess of £500million is Spain's richest woman.

The 18th Duchess of Alba has 57 titles according to the Guinness Book of World Records and is said to have once turned down an offer to be the must of Spanish painter Pablo Picasso. 

The eccentric last came to international attention in 2011 when she danced flamenco at her wedding to Alfonso Diez, a civil servant 25 years her junior.
