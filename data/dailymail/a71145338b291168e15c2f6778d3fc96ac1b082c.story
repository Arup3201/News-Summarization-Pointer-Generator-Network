A 31-year-old man has told how he managed to drop an astonishing 20 stone in 18 months – thanks to a new pair of insoles.

David Sameiro has made an incredible journey, going from a 33st sedentary man with a fast food addiction to a svelte and avid walker.

Free of the aches and pains that used to plague him, he now walks everywhere he can.

Then and now: David, 31, from London, has lost 
20 stone in 18 months after he bought a pair of copper soles in November
 2012, that took away his joint pain and made it possible for him to 
exercise again

The retail manager from West London credits a pair of copper insoles used to treat arthritis for getting him off his feet.

Mr Sameiro began to pile on the pounds in his
 late 20s and as his weight crept up, began to experience arthritis-like symptoms.

By November 2012, he weighed 33 stone.

‘Back
 then, my l life was unbearable - and it was impossible to exercise due to my
 weight,' he told MailOnline.

'My social life was non-existent and I was often extremely 
depressed.'

Bigger guy: David says he always was a bit overweight growing up but the pounds started seriously piling on in his late 20s when his joint pain stopped him from exercising at all, making him depressed and isolated, which in turn saw him turn to food for comfort

He says that to most people, he probably did not seem to eat much.

But 
although he would have a normal cereal breakfast and sandwich and crisps
 and a chocolate bar for lunch, he binged on takeaways and unhealthy 
snacks at night.

‘I would 
order the biggest size pizza, fried food, any takeaway,' he said.

Svelte: Mr Sameiro is now looking for love

'I didn’t want to
 go out as people would stare at me; using public transport was 
embarrassing due to my size.’

His
 size saw him suffer from pain in his ankles, knees and lower back as 
well as severe chafing.

He soon found it too exhausting to even walk a 
few yards - and decided things had to change.

‘I heard about The Original Copper 
Heeler insoles so I bought two pairs and started wearing them. As far as
 I’m concerned they saved my life.

'After
 just ten days I noticed a massive reduction in pain and this meant I was able to
 walk more.

'Then, after three weeks, I found myself walking half way to work and 
half way home -the weight began to drop off.'

He added: 'This
 was so encouraging that I started talking walks in the evenings after 
work and at the weekends instead of sitting at home snacking in front of
 the TV.

‘As I progressed, I 
also started to change my diet. I no longer binge on junk at 
night, and often choose to have a soup or something lighter at lunch.

'I 
still have the occasional takeaway, but it’s nothing like it was before.

‘I don’t want to go back. My life has turned around completely; I’m now looking for a relationship and want to start a family, something that I thought I would never be able to achieve.’

The apparent healing powers of copper were first pioneered by the ancient Greeks who used copper bracelets to ease aches and pains (the insoles claim to contain 14 times more copper than bracelets).

David says the Original Copper Heels, made for arthritis sufferers, saved his life

Copper is an essential mineral in the body and is thought to keep blood vessels, the immune system and bones healthy.

The Arthritis Foundation reports there
 is no scientific research to prove the effectiveness from copper 
bracelets. However it also says there is none to prove the contrary.

Tony
 Andrews, of The Original Copper Heeler, the company which invented the 
copper insoles, said: 'I was passionate in finding a completely natural,
 drug free solution to stop the torturing pain of this “quality-of-life”
 destroying disease. People from all walks of life are wearing the 
copper heelers.'
