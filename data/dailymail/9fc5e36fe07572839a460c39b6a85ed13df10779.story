Jacintha Saldanha left three suicide notes in her bedroom at King Edward VII hospital in Marylebone, London

The nurse who hanged herself after 
falling for a hoax phone call about the Duchess of Cambridge blamed the 
two Australian DJ pranksters for her death, it has emerged.

And a dramatic confrontation with the 
late nurse’s family is looming – as one of the DJs has announced she may
attend the inquest in person.

Mother-of-two Jacintha Saldanha, 46, 
was on reception duty at the London hospital where the duchess was being
treated when presenters Mel Greig and Michael Christian rang in 
December, pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles and asking for a
condition report.

Not seeing through their low-quality impressions, Mrs
Saldanha put them through to a nurse helping treat the duchess for 
morning sickness.

The stunt, which drew out information 
about Kate’s medical condition, was broadcast in full and rocketed the 
radio pair to international fame. But that turned to infamy when Mrs 
Saldanha was found hanged three days later.

Now it has emerged that in one of the 
three letters Mrs Saldanha left  in her nurses’ accommodation in London,
she directly accused the two Australian DJs of driving her to her 
death.

She even said they should pay  the 
mortgage for the Bristol home where her accountant husband Benedict 
Barboza, 49, and children Junal, 17, and Lisha, 14, still live.

In the 
handwritten note, addressed to her managers at the Edward VII hospital, 
she said: ‘Please accept my apologies. I am truly sorry. Thank you for 
all your support.

‘I hold the Radio Australians  Mel 
Greig and Michael Christian responsible for this act. Please make them 
pay my mortgage. I am sorry. Jacintha.’.

Presenter Mel Greig has not returned to work since the incident last December. Friends say she may never take on a role in the spotlight again

The note is likely to be examined 
closely at the inquest, which was due to take place this week but has 
been delayed until the autumn.

It has already emerged that the nurse,
born and trained in India,  had been on anti-depressants after 
reportedly attempting suicide during a family visit home at Christmas 
2011.

A source involved with the investigation has claimed that after 
being discharged from the hospital that treated her in India it was 
recommended she had round-the-clock supervision due to her suicide risk.

Her family, however, maintain she only
went to hospital in India after an accident. Her London employers were 
not told she was a suicide risk.

The inquest may see one of the DJs give her account of what happened.

Greig, who has not returned to work 
since the furore, suffering stress, has obtained the coroner’s 
permission to give evidence, and may do so in person, although possibly 
by video link.

The suicide note said she wants the DJs to pay for her mortgage because they are responsible for her death

Her lawyer Steven Edward said: ‘She 
understands the family’s need for answers and wants to help them find 
them. She is also determined to address any allegations about her role 
in these matters.

‘Miss Greig wants the family to know she will answer any questions the coroner or the family’s lawyer may have at the inquest.’

Christian, meanwhile, has moved to a less prestigious presenting role.

A legal representative of the owners 
of the 2DayFM radio station, Southern Cross Austereo, is already due to 
be present. The company  has offered to pay around £350,000  to a trust 
fund for the tragic  nurse’s family.

Mrs Saldanha’s other notes absolved her colleagues of blame for her death, and left instructions  for her funeral.

Her family were yesterday unavailable 
for comment, but Labour MP Keith Vaz, who has been representing them, 
said: ‘The forthcoming inquest will hopefully provide answers for the 
family and for them it will represent closure.’
