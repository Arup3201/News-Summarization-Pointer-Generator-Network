Florida police investigating a string of burglaries have arrested a 19-year-old man after he posted photographs of himself with some of the stolen goods on Instagram.

The Palm Beach County Sheriff's office was already watching Depree Johnson closely in connection with jewelry thefts in several Boynton Beach retirement communities when he posted the incriminating evidence.

Police arrested Johnson last Wednesday after obtaining a search warrant for his apartment.Â

They were monitoring his social media
accounts when he posted pictures of himself on Instagram posing with 
two guns - an act that led directly to his arrest.

As
a convicted felon, Johnson - who has been arrested on drug, car-theft, 
firearm-possession and trespassing charges previously - is not permitted
to possess firearms.

In
fact, reports WPBF, the young man has so many prior convictions that 
when arresting officers asked him his occupation, he replied, 'Thief.'

According
to WPBF, detectives recovered the two guns and boxes of ammunition in 
Johnson's Lake Worth home - as well as about $250,000 worth of stolen 
jewels.

A gang nicknamed the Dinnertime 
Burglars by police is responsible for around 30 to 40 break-ins since 
March, targeting homes of older residents and stealing valuable jewelry.

Police said Depree Johnson is the ringleader of the gang after uncovered numerous pieces of stolen jewelry, watches, loose diamonds and electronics.
