Gloucester ruined Exeter’s centenary celebrations as they edged their West Country rivals at Sandy Park. It was the 100th game in the Premiership for the Devon club against the side who they defeated on their first game in rugby’s top flight back in 2010.

The usually reliable boot of Gareth Steenson was most culpable. The Chiefs fly-half gifted the visitors a crucial try when Exeter were on top in the second half. 

The Ulsterman’s misjudged kick from his own line was charged down by Tom Savage. It came two minutes after Chiefs had snatched the initiative with two tries in two minutes by wingers Jack Nowell and Matt Jess.

Steenson also failed with a vital conversion after Thomas Waldrom had crashed over with nine minutes left. His kick would have given the Chiefs a one-point lead late on, but his attempt came back off the left post.

Exeter were the better team in the first half, but were unable to convert pressure into points. Two penalties from Greig Laidlaw were the only scores of a lacklustre half.

What was a fluctuating game fortunately sparked up in the second half. First England centre Billy Twelvetrees stroked home a superb drop kick from 45 metres to put Gloucester 9-0 ahead.

Then, Nowell gave England team-mate Ben Morgan the slip in the 49th minute to score the first try of the game, which was quickly followed by a 80-metre dash from Jess to the line after he gobbled up a wayward pass from Twelvetrees.

Steenson converted both tries to put Chiefs 14-9 ahead.

But after Steenson’s error let in Savage, Laidlaw converted to give Gloucester a narrow lead. Steenson and Laidlaw exchanged penalties before Ben Morgan crashed over to gain breathing space.

Waldrom’s try looked to have given Exeter the final say, but Steenson’s conversion effort was marginally off target and Gloucester held on.

Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys was delighted with his side’s efforts. ‘Today was all about the result,’ he said. ‘I thought we showed a huge amount of character and spirit.’

Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter bemoaned his side’s errors as they lost for only the second time at home this season. ‘What’s hurt us is the fact we didn’t convert some of the opportunities. But what hurt us more is some silly play.’
