University of Sydney ecologist Lizzy Lowe found that spiders thrive in Sydney's rich suburbs

Spiders have embraced city life and are living it up in Sydney's affluent suburbs as recent research found they are bigger and more fertile in these areas.

The study revealed golden orb weaving spiders were particularly thriving in Tamarama Beach - just a km away from Bondi in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

The research, conducted by PhD student Lizzie Lowe from the University of Sydney, found the largest golden orb weighed three grams and was as big as the palm of her hand.

And their webs can measure up to three metres.

The smaller spiders were found in rural sites such as the Brisbane Waters National Park, near the Central Coast - north of Sydney, where the smallest measured 0.5 grams.

The study, published on Wednesday in science journal POS ONE, discovered the commonly feared eight-legged arthropods preferred urbanised cities rather than country-living.

Ms Lowe put this down to the fact that these fanged creatures enjoy living by the coast and big open areas.

Ms Lowe further suggested the concrete structures help retain heat better than their natural habitat, which may give them more energy to reproduce and also help them survive longer than their six-month lifespan.

She also found female spiders from the city had larger ovaries, which meant they either had larger eggs or were producing more offspring.

Ms Lowe believes the findings could be the result of wealthier suburbs spending more money on land management, which creates a healthier habitat for spiders.

She stressed that the increasing population of golden orbs in the city is highly beneficial for the ecosystem as they help control flies, mosquitoes and other insects.

'It's really not a bad thing that they're getting bigger because they are such an important part of our ecosystem,' she said.

'It's fascinating that these spiders are adapting and surviving in our ever-changing landscape and it's something we should encourage.'
