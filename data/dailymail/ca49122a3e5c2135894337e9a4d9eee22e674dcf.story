Suicide: An autopsy report has confirmed that director Tony Scott killed himself in August

At least five female motorists reported seeing director Tony Scott leap to his death from a Southern California bridge in mid-August, according to 911 tapes released on Tuesday.

The 68-year-old filmmaker behind movies like Top Gun and Crimson Tide committed suicide by jumping off Vincent Thomas Bridge linking the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach in broad daylight on August 19 in full view of boaters and passing drivers.

‘We are just on the Vincent Thomas Bridge and there’s a guy that looks like he’s just about to jump off … he’s jumped, he’s jumped, [off] the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro!’ said one 911 caller heard in a recording posted on TMZ.com.

Another witness reported the fatal 
leap to 911 operators, and was then transferred to a fire dispatcher. 
During the transfer, she could be heard gasping: ‘Oh my God.’

The caller said: ‘He was a bald white guy. Oh my gosh, he just jumped off the bridge. We actually witnessed the whole thing.’

Motorists driving over the bridge 
reported seeing a black Toyota Prius, lights still flashing, parked on 
the side, as an older white male climbed a pole before leaping more than
 185 feet into the water.

Scott had been preparing to do a sequel to his 1986 Tom Cruise hit Top Gun.

He and Cruise were spotted in Fallon,
 Nevada — where the Navy’s Top Gun program had been based before moving 
to San Diego — meeting with Navy officials, a week before the suicide.

The mystery surrounding Scott's death
 has deepened after his death certificate was released in late August - 
listing his cause of death as 'deferred'.

Instead of the expected verdict of 
suicide, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health has decided to wait
 for toxicology and other test results and said the death is 'pending 
investigation'.

The 
certificate states that an autopsy has been performed, that the 
68-year-old died 'Under Vincent Thomas Bridge' - but also indicates that
 a biopsy was not performed on the dead body.

There has been no confirmation from 
the Department of Public Health if the famed director of action films was suffering from cancer as some 
reports indicated.

In late August,the coroner's office said that Tony Scott left a suicide note 
and several messages to loved ones before he jumped to his death, but 
none of them shed light on why he killed himself.

Coroner’s
 officials also said that the notes didn’t mention any health problems, 
after reports circulated that the 68-year-old may have been suffering 
from cancer.

Unclear: His death certificate initially failed to list a cause of death for the well-known director

Coroner's office spokesman Ed Winter 
says one of the notes left in Scott's black Toyota Prius was a list of 
emergency contact numbers and another found in his study included 
messages to friends and loved ones.

The note in the car listed names and 
contact numbers - including that of his wife - so police could call his 
friends to tell them of his death, TMZ reported.

The mystery surrounding the suicide 
deepened after the chairman of 20th Century Fox said that the director 
was 'burning with excitement' over new projects just two weeks before 
his suicide.

It also emerged that just two days 
before 68-year-old Scott leaped to his death he had been with Tom Cruise
 discussing a sequel to their 1986 hit 'Top Gun'.

The
 pair toured the Fallon U.S Naval air station in Nevada, which is home 
to the Naval Weapons Fighter School where the real life Top Gun pilots 
complete their training.

'We had a meeting just two weeks ago 
and he was burning with the excitement of creating stuff,' said Tom 
Rothman, chairman of 20th Century Fox.

Scott had more big-budget Hollywood 
films lined up, but his death has left them in limbo, as well as 
stunning his family and friends.

Coroner's officers in Los Angeles 
said that they were still trying to solve the suicide riffle after 
Scott's wife Donna said U.S. reports that her husband had cancer were 
'absolutely false'.

Friends of the director said that he 
had no marriage or money problems and was focused on the 'Top Gun' 
sequel which was preparing to go into production early next year.

Scott was also in pre-production on 
an underwater drug-trafficking thriller 'Narco-Sub', another smuggling 
drama 'Lucky Strike' and a remake of the 1969 western 'The Wild Bunch'.

While celebrity website TMZ reported 
that Scott's wife didn't know of any serious illness that may have been a
 motive, it raised the possibility that the director of 'Crimson Tide' 
may have kept his illness secret.

If not there must have been a 
different reason behind his decision to leap from the Vincent Thomas 
Bridge in Long Beach on Sunday afternoon.

He left a contact list of people to 
be informed about the tragedy in the Toyota Prius he abandoned before 
climbing a fence and jumping into the Pacific.

The 68-year-old director, best known 
for Top Gun, was said to have leaped to his death 'without hesitation' 
in an effort to spare his family the pain of watching his slow death, 
ABC News reported.

But hours later, ABC backed away from that report and the Los Angeles Times confirmed that Scott's family told the corner's office Scott did not have cancer - or any major illness.

'The
 family told us it is incorrect that he has inoperable brain cancer,' 
Craig Harvey, a chief at the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office told 
the newspaper.

TMZ were the first to report that Scott's wife Donna told authorities her husband was healthy, according to unnamed sources.

Donna Scott told investigators that rumors
 of a return of her husband's cancer was 'absolutely false', TMZ says.

The
 celebrity news site also claims the preliminary results of an autopsy 
did not reveal the presence of cancer - though more tests are needed. It
 is believed the autopsy report could take several weeks

The denial of his brain cancer begs the question - what could have driven the successful director, whose 
films have grossed more than $2 billion and who left behind a young family, to kill himself?

Tony Scott's tragic death came just 
weeks after he was pictured looking pained as he left a Beverly Hills 
restaurant on July 23 - but friends denied he had problems in his 
marriage to wife Donna.

A source told the New York Post: 'He did have 
cancer, and for a while he was cancer free. He didn’t have any money 
problems or marriage problems.'

The beloved filmmaker, who
 directed movies including Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop II and Enemy Of 
The State and was the younger brother of director Ridley Scott,  fell within feet of a cruise boat around 12.30 p.m. on Sunday as horrified tourists watched.

'He landed right next to our tour boat, and many 
of us saw the whole thing,' a witness, who had been on the cruise around the Los Angeles Harbour, told TMZ.

According to the Contra Costa Times, Scott climbed a fence on the south side of the bridge, which spans San Pedro and Terminal Island, at 12.30 p.m. on Sunday and leaped off 'without hesitation'.

A witness, who was a passenger in a car driving along the bridge, said Scott looked nervous.

'He was on the roadway close to the fence looking around. He was looking around and fumbling with something at his feet. He looked nervous,' David Silva told the Los Angeles Times.

Silva thought he was a stuntman or taking part in an extreme sports event - until he realised there was no safety cord.

He went on: '[He] paused a couple of seconds and then began
 to climb the fence. He put his foot on the top of the fence and paused 
again. Then he threw himself off. I immediately thought, that guy is
 dead.'

Friends told the New York Post they were not surprised that the director chose to leap to his death as he was a thrill-seeker who loved scaling high mountains.

Several people called 911 around 
12.35pm to report that someone had jumped off the bridge, according to Los Angeles police Lt. Tim 
Nordquist.

British-born Scott, who lived in Beverly Hills, was producer and director Ridley Scott's younger brother.

Distinct visual styles mark both siblings' films - Ridley Scott mastering the creation of entire worlds with such films as Gladiator, Blade Runner, Alien and this year's Prometheus, Tony Scott known for hyper-kinetic action and editing on such films as his most recent, the runaway train thriller Unstoppable, starring regular collaborator Denzel Washington.

Tony was the first of the Scott brothers to enjoy blockbuster success with Top Gun, starring Tom Cruise, the top-grossing film of 1986 at $176 million.

Scott teamed with Cruise again four years later on the hit Days of Thunder. He also had a sequel to Top Gun in development.

But Ridley Scott later managed more and bigger hits than his brother and earned a level of critical respect never achieved by Tony Scott.

Gladiator won the best-picture Academy Award for 2000 and earned Ridley Scott one of his three best-director nominations; Tony Scott never was in the running for an Oscar, and critics often slammed his movies for emphasizing style over substance.

The two brothers ran Scott Free Productions and were working jointly on a film called Killing Lincoln, based on the best seller by Bill O'Reilly.

Their company produced the CBS dramas NUMB3RS and The Good Wife as well as a 2011 documentary about the Battle of Gettysburg for the History Channel.

Besides Unstoppable, Scott worked with Washington on four other movies: Crimson Tide, Man on Fire,  Deja Vu and The Taking of Pelham 123.

Other Scott films include True Romance, written by Quentin Tarantino, The Fan, with Robert De Niro, and Enemy of the State, starring Will Smith.
