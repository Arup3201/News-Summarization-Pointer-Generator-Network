The recorded message from Sergeant Scott Faile to his wife and children moved the entire crowd at this weekend's big game at University of South Carolina’s Williams-Brice stadium.

After winning a competition to be the Military Family of the Game, Tammy Faile, 41, and her two children Breanna, 15, and Cameron, 10, were over the moon about receiving a message from Sgt. Faile from his posting in South Korea.

But after the message had been played on the big screen, an even bigger surprise awaited them as Sgt. Faile stepped onto the stadium in full camouflage gear to greet his family in person.

Surprise! Tammy, Breanna and Cameron run to hug Sergeant Scott Faile after he walks onto the pitch

A very emotional video recording of the Sergeant First Class's stunt was posted on YouTube this weekend, and has been viewed over 383,400 times in three days.

It shows Tammy, Breanna and Cameron being cheered on by the 86,000 strong crowd which had gathered at the stadium on Saturday to watch the game between Scott Faile’s favourite team, the South Carolina Gamecocks, and the University of Georgia’s Bulldogs.

After the announcer introduces the family and the message from Sgt. Faile, emotions overcome mother and children as they watch their beloved family member greet them from his base in South Korea.

‘Hey guys, I love you and I miss you,’ Sgt Faile, from Kershaw, South Carolina is heard saying in his message.

‘I really would like to be there to watch the Gamecocks beat up on Georgia. Just keep in mind my tour is over soon.’

Plan: The message which appeared on the big screens at the stadium had been recorded before Sgt Faile returned from South Korea

What his emotional family does not know is that although the message is from South Korea, Sgt. Faile himself is only feet away from them, preparing his surprise entrance.

As he walks onto the stadium, Breanna can be seen shouting ‘Oh my God!‘ before she starts running towards her father – but in a bid to get to her husband before her daughter Tammy grabs her by her Gamecocks shirt, pulling her back.

‘Once I saw him, I didn't hear anything else,’ Mrs Faile told WLTX.

‘That was it. It could have been completely silent or it could have been louder than what it was and I never would have heard it. It was like everything else was drowned out.’

On the subject of being outrun by her mother 15-year-old Breanna joked that she tried to get there first but that ‘definitely didn't happen because some people were trying to trip me up.’

Despite thousands of ecstatic people screaming around them, it appears once they were reunited nothing else existed for the Failes as they eventually had to be asked to move to make way for the marching band.

‘I had absolutely no idea. I mean, I didn’t even have a thought. That’s what just made it so overwhelming,’ Sgt Faile said to ABCNews about walking onto the pitch and hearing the crowd’s reaction. ‘I think the entire stadium was in tears. Over 85,000 people were in tears.’

The fact that the video of the family has become an internet hit was never part of Sgt Faile’s elaborate scheme.

‘I was just doing something for the family, and I guess it just kind of spun out of control.’

He spent three months planning the surprise with the help of Kaela Harmon, public relations manager with Columbia Metropolitan Airport and the University of South Carolina.

'It was perfect timing, they had no idea. I told them that I had entered them on the SEC [Southeastern Conference] website, which was total fiction.’

His wife and children are equally amazed by the attention.

‘We’re just over the moon,’ Mrs Faile said. ‘He’s such an awesome man. For him to do something like this, the words that he said on that video, he just completely blew me away.

‘I know how wonderful he is, but now the whole world knows.’

Sgt. Faile had returned home from South Korea, after completing his third tour of duty. He had previously served in Afghanistan and Kuwait. The family is now stationed in Augusta, Georgia.
