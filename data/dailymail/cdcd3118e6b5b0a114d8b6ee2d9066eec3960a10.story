To those who find themselves barely managing to juggle their jobs, daily chores and looking after the children, it will certainly come as a far-fetched suggestion.

But an official survey has found that – statistically at least – British women are the ‘leisure queens’ of Europe, who apparently enjoy more downtime than their sisters almost anywhere else in the Western world.

International research suggests they spend around five and a half hours a day on leisure activities, when averaged out over the week.

Women in the UK spend more time on leisure each day anywhere in the European, and are only behind Norway globally, according to a league table published by the OECD

This is behind only one country in the industrialised world – Norway.

This
 daily leisure time for British women includes more than two hours 
watching TV or listening to the radio, according to the analysis by the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Even so, chaps 
are hardly in a position to complain – for the figures also reveal that 
British men spend even longer on leisure than women, at almost six and a
 half hours.

What’s more, they spend less than half as much time doing 
housework than the fairer sex.

Women spend most of their leisure time watching TV or listening to the radio

Women in the UK spend most of the day on personal care, including sleeping, followed by lesiure, unpaid work, and then paid work

The
 analysis by the OECD, which represents the world’s 34 most 
industrialised nations, draws on a decade of surveys.

It shows women in 
the UK spent three hours 17 minutes working or studying each day, four 
hours 18 minutes in unpaid work, such as looking after children, 
shopping or housework, and five hours 39 minutes on leisure.

They
 also found time for just under ten hours on ‘personal care’, including 
eight hours 10 minutes sleeping, one hour eating and 48 minutes on 
personal or medical services.

An
 OECD spokesman said: ‘The Northern Europeans are the queens of leisure,
 with women in Norway spending more time relaxing than anyone else, 
followed by the UK.

When it comes to housework, women in the UK spend more washing and cleaning than any country except Mexico and India

The Chinese spend the most time on work or study, with women in the UK using 197 minutes a day on average

‘In 
virtually every country, men are able to fit in valuable extra minutes 
of leisure each day while women spend more time doing unpaid housework.'

Leisure was defined as including watching TV or listening to the radio,
 participating in or attending events, sports and visiting and 
entertaining friends.

British women’s leisure time was much higher than the OECD average of four hours and 42 minutes.

By
 contrast, women France spend four and a half hours, a similar figure to
 the US and Australia. Portugal was the lowest at three hours and 20 
minutes. Top of the table was Norway, at more than six hours.

Women in the UK get less sleep than Americans, Swedes, South Africans, Italians and the Irish

The UK figures relate to 2005, the latest available.

Interestingly,
 when it comes to time spent on personal care, France and Italy emerged 
on top, with French women spending 11 hours 44 minutes, just ahead of 
Italian women on 11 hours and 37 minutes.

And
 the men in these countries spend almost as much time on personal care –
 with Italian males just ahead at 11 hours and 37 minutes versus 11 
hours and 28 for the French. By contrast, British women spend just short
 of 10 hours.
