A group of at least 40 members of nine football teams in Las Vegas visiting for a youth football tournament fell mysteriously ill on Friday. The teams and families are currently staying at the Rio Casino.

Justin Gates, the head of the organization running the tournament, said, 'As of now there are nine teams reporting illness and three of those teams are from Las Vegas,' Justin Gates told News 3 reporters.

'We first thought it was an illness spread at the team weigh-in on Wednesday, but the three Las Vegas teams weighed in on Tuesday. We now think it might just be a flu-like illness spreading in Western states. It's hard to tell because many of the teams traveled up to 48 hours on a bus to get to Las Vegas and that could have made it easy to spread the bug.'

For one group of 20 people from Santa Monica California, at least 18 people came down with flu like symptoms and needed to be hospitalized. 13 of those hospitalized were children.

Despite players throwing up on the field, The Santa Monica Vikings won the tournament and are national champions

NBC reports that Anna Maria Meyer's 10-year-old son started experiencing symptoms at 4:30 am on Friday. He complained of abdominal pain and he was vomiting and had diarrhea.

Meyer's son was hospitalized along with fellow teammates and doctors took blood samples to investigate the cause of illness. Results for those tests may take 48 hours. Doctors still don't know what is making the group sick but they believe it is an airborne virus. They are investigating all the places the children andÂ  families visited, including places they dined. After Meyer's son left the hospital he began throwing up again at 10:30 pm and she told NBC reporters that she may take him back to the hospital.

Parent Anna Lisa says she hopes her child's team feels better so that they can play and 'kick some butt'

Meyer told reporters that her son's teammates were throwing up on the field as other teammates played. The Santa Monica Vikings still won the game and are national champions. Another team from Bakersfeild, California said that 25 people were suffering symptoms, 15 of whom are children and 10 adults. Parents and children were transported to University Medical Center (UMC) by Casino shuttles. News 3 reports that 17 patients arrived on Friday and that 15 were treated and were allowed to leave in the afternoon. Two of those treated were mothers who went to the Emergency room at 2:30pm on Friday.

The Santa Monica Vikings facebook page said, 'We understand the media is trying to contact us but unfortunately we are not feeling up to talking at this time.'
