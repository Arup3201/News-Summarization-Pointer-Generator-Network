Doctors in India have removed a penknife from the stomach of a six-month-old boy who had been wearing it around his neck to ward off evil spirits.

Dev Thakor, who comes from a village in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, Western India, swallowed the knife by accident while being breastfed by his mother Rekha Ben.

He had been wearing it on a string around his neck, which is a local tradition.

Dev's father, Bharat Thakor, said his son 'suddenly started crying, screaming' before his family noticed the knife was missing. 

The child was then rushed to a private hospital where an X-ray confirmed he had swallowed the penknife.

The two-inch foldable knife came off its string last Friday as Dev was being fed by his mother. He then swallowed it without her noticing. 

Mr Thakor, a tea stall owner, didn't have enough money for his son's surgery but his neighbours and customers came to his aid and 'saved my son's life'. 

Dr Shravan Bohra, chief gastroenterologist at Apollo Hospitals where Dev's operation was performed, said the child was lucky to have survived the ordeal without suffering serious injury.

He said: ‘It was a critical case as the knife was lying open in the upper part of Dev’s stomach and could have harmed the Mucosa - the inner part of his body - but fortunately he was remarkably not injured.'

Sailash Patel, who sponsored Dev's surgery, said when he heard about the boy's condition his only wish was to save his life.

The 50-year-old came to learn of the child's ordeal after asking why Mr Thakor's tea stall - which he stopped at almost daily - was closed. 

He said: 'I knew it would be hard for him to afford the operation so I offered to pay the fees. 

'I am a father of two children myself and I couldn’t imagine what Bharat was going through.’

Dev was discharged from hospital on Sunday and is said to be recovering well at home.
