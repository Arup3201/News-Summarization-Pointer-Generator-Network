Pilots have been asked not to fly over Edinburgh zoo to avoid disturbing pregnant panda Tian Tian.

The Civil Aviation Authority published a notice asking pilots not to fly in the area, after the zoo requested a reduction in noise during the breeding season.

Zookeepers asked for the measure to be taken after Tian Tian - whose name means ‘Sweetie’ - was artificially inseminated earlier this year.

Zoo keepers in Edinburgh believe Tian Tain the panda is pregnant and should give birth at the end of August

The panda was artificially inseminated in April and now there is an anxious wait to see if there is a cub 

To give Tian Tian her best chance, pilots have been asked to avoid the airspace around Edinburgh Zoo 

After months of careful monitoring, they announced last week that the giant panda is pregnant and may give birth by the end of August.

If the pregnancy is successful the panda cub will be the first ever to be born in Britain, a huge success for conservationists and a coup for Scotland in the run-up to the independence vote in September.

Public interest in the panda and her mate Yang Guang is very high, undimmed by two previous unsuccessful breeding attempts.

The pair, who are on loan to Edinburgh Zoo from China, failed to mate in 2012 and Tian Tian had a failed pregnancy last year.

This time, aided by modern artificial insemination techniques, scientists hope they could finally see a panda cub - or even twins or triplets - born in Britain.

If the pregnancy is successful it could mean a £50million boost to the Scottish economy, studies suggest.

A Notice To Airmen, or NoTam, was published by the Civil Aviation Authority asking pilots not to fly in the area if possible to reduce noise from low-flying planes and helicopters.

NoTams are usually issued to alert aircraft pilots to potential hazards along a flight route such as cranes, closed runways or large public events.

The notice covering Edinburgh Zoo was issued in July to protect all its animals, notably its breeding penguin population. But the likely pregnancy of Tian Tian was also a factor, the zoo said.

It comes during the Edinburgh Festival and Military Tattoo, which sees increased air traffic over the city, including RAF displays.

A spokesman for the zoo told The Herald newspaper: ‘Edinburgh Zoo has a NoTam in place over its airspace to prevent disturbance to all animals in the collection, yet it is mainly asked in consideration of the breeding penguin colony.

‘It is particularly relevant at this time of year due to the regular increased activity of low-flying aircraft and hovering helicopters which occur as a result of the festival.

‘We have been in contact with the Military Tattoo and the RAF for several years now and they have both always been very supportive and considerate of our requests.’

The giant panda was artificially inseminated on April 13 and experts at the zoo monitored Tian Tian closely in the following months.

Last week it was revealed that the latest scientific data suggests she is pregnant.

Zookeepers have said things are progressing as expected and they are ‘keeping their fingers crossed’ for the arrival of a cub at the end of this month.

Tian Tian’s hormone and protein levels are being checked regularly but it will not be known for certain if she is pregnant until she gives birth.

A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said: ‘Following a request from Edinburgh Zoo through the air traffic control unit at Edinburgh Airport, we issued a NoTam on July 11 requesting pilots to not fly within a one-mile radius of the zoo or below 1,900 feet above sea level.

‘The NoTam was advisory so if necessary, pilots could still fly through this area providing they complied with the rules of the air.

‘The NoTam expired on July 31 and there are no plans to issue any similar advice to pilots operating in the area.’
