Accused pervert: Cliff Oshman sent profane, sexually charged emails to an u8ndercover officer he thought was a 14-year-old girl.

A 64-year-old Florida man was arrested Friday after bringing his family to meet a 14-year-old girl he’d be grooming for months to join them in group sex.

Cliff Oshman, of Daytona Beach, went to a local grocery store to meet the young girl, wife and young daughter in tow, only to find out ‘she’ was an undercover cop – the depraved man was arrested and charged with multiple offenses.

Mr Oshman initially made contact with the undercover officer through an ad placed online looking for someone willing to have sex with his family. He and the police officer chatted for seven months before agreeing to meet, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

The perverse patriarch’s original online ad ‘was looking for someone to add to his cozy family and that the age of the person did not matter,’ said an arrest report reviewed by MailOnline.

An undercover cop responded, posing as a 14-year-old girl, and was subjected to chats from March until this week about Mr Oshman’s desire to have a sexual relationship with a young girl, according to the arrest report.

Even worse, his family was in on the scheme.

‘The wife and daughter were given a ride to the police department and during that ride [his wife] told detectives that the defendant and she were supposed to meet a 14-year-old girl for sex,’ the arrest report said.

Reading like a chat log from NBC’s ‘Dateline: To Catch a Predator’ television series, the deranged man wrote about his impulses and fantasies, but also expressed concern over being caught.

The accused pedophile wrote in emails to the undercover officer about fantasizing that while with his wife, he was really having sex with the young girl, according to the arrest report.

The man wrote of want to taste and see the young girl unclothed, about various sex acts he wanted to perform on her and sent several pictures of his genitalia to the officer, the arrest report said, detailing the explicit, profane emails.

Mr Oshman then discussed via email how sleeping with the young girl without being arrested might work.

‘If you get caught with me, they arrest me… when people discover we are lovers, and find out your age, there will certainly be a scandal,’ Mr Oshman said, according to the arrest report.

‘We need to make a plan to handle it OK ... I sincerely would love you to be in my life,’ he continued.

Mr Oshman faces a litany of felony charges for his actions including using a computer to solicit a child for sex, traveling to solicit a child for sex, two counts of transmitting images harmful to a child and using a two-way communication device to commit a felony.

Mr Oshman does not appear to have a prior criminal history, according to records. It also is not clear if Mr Oshman's wife faces any charges for aiding and abetting his plans.
