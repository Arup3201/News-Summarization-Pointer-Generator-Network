Health Secretary Andrew Lansley (pictured) risks igniting another row in the sector after documents revealed he is backing plans to pay less to NHS workers in poorer parts of the country

Andrew Lansley is risking a new row with the unions after supporting lower pay for thousands of NHS staff who live in poorer parts of the country.

The Health Secretary wants nurses, midwives, porters, cleaners and paramedics to receive different pay packets dependent on where they live.

More expensive house prices and other factors would mean NHS staff would be paid more in the south east than in the north and the midlands.

Official documents prepared by the Department of Health show that the only exemptions would be managers working in new bodies established to deliver Mr Lansley’s reform programme.

Chancellor George Osborne raised the issue of regional pay bargaining before the Budget, but senior Lib Dems opposed it.

Mr Lansley’s submission to the NHS pay review body called for a national basic pay rate at a ‘minimum level necessary’, and forsupplements in particular regions.

This would help the private sector in depressed areas compete for workers with the public sector.

‘Current rates of pay in the NHS do vary geographically, but significantly less so than the pay of comparable staff in the private sector,’ the submission says.

‘The introduction of more sensitive market-facing pay would therefore enable more efficient and effective use of NHS funds.

Nurses, midwives, hospital porters, cleaners and paramedics would receive a lower paycheck under the proposals if they work in the Midlands or the north, compared with their counterparts in southern counties

‘While the NHS pay premium is relatively high, there is the potential for private sector enterprise to be crowded out with adverse impact on the prospects for local economic growth.’

But senior Lib Dem backbencher John Pugh said: ‘Not content with cementing the divisions between the north and south, Andrew’s proposals harden the divisions between the well-paid and the rest. This demonstrates his continuing, unfortunate talent for alienating the people he needs to rely on most: NHS staff.

‘Regional pay proposals and the blinkered ideology that underpins it remains a red line for many Lib Dem MPs and risk provoking an enduring, embittering standoff within the coalition which will profit no one.’

Lib Dem MP John Pugh (pictured), co-chair of the party's parliamentary policy committee on health and social care, said the plans will further widen the divide between north and south, well-paid and the rest

And Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison, the largest health union, said: ‘For a government that says it wants to cut paperwork, introducing regional pay would be a massively expensive, bureaucratic nightmare, designed to cause huge disruption and conflict.’

Commenting on the proposals, the Department of Health said: 'Our evidence shows how more market-facing pay could help employers make better use of the NHS pay bill.

'It makes clear that  there is a compelling case for implementing market facing pay for all Agenda and Change staff in England, whether they fulfil a support role, work in admin or work on the front line, such as nurses and other clinical staff. 

'The principle of equal pay applies to all staff across the entire country.'
