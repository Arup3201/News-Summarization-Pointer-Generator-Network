Officials at a Utah high school who digitally added sleeves to students' tank tops and erased one girl's tattoo in yearbook photos they deemed to be too sexy have apologized.

Wasatch High School administrators in recent days offered at least one student the chance to return her yearbook for a refund.

But some say they want to keep the memento of their stance against a policy they say singled out some students. Others say they're eager to move past the ordeal and on with summer vacation, which began Friday.

District officials declined to comment Tuesday, pointing to their statement last week acknowledging error in doctoring pictures of some students but not others who were similarly dressed.

Wasatch High School is in Heber City, about 40 miles outside Salt Lake City.

The faculty came under fire last week when students cracked their yearbooks to find Photoshop had been used to censor photos deemed too sexy.

The school altered the images of certain students to show less skin without them knowing about it.

When the students received the much anticipated yearbook, they were shocked to see they appear to be wearing a different outfit.

Some complained, and said they felt upset that the decision to alter the photos were not made consistently.

'I feel like they put names in a hat and pick and choose who,' Sophomore Rachel Russel told KSTU-TV last week.

'There were plenty of girls (who) were wearing thicker tank tops and half of them got edited and half of them didn't.'

Russel's original picture showed her wearing a sleeveless top. But the version seen in the yearbook has black sleeves added on.

Sophomore 
Kimberly Montoya added: 'My shirt was a cream color, and the color of 
the cover-up was completely white. It looked like white-out on my skin.'

The apparently random editing process is what angered the girls the most.

In
 one case, according to the TV station, two different girls were wearing
 nearly identical tops but only one was altered to add sleeves while the
 other was printed as it was.

School administrators said the yearbook couldn't be changed after printing.

Wasatch County School District Superintendent Terry E. Shoemaker later defended the decision to edit images for modesty.

He claimed students knew the dress code and there was a sign warning them that their pictures may be altered.

However, Shoemaker admits the school should have taken a more consistent approach.

'We only apologize in the sense that we want to be more consistent with what we're trying to do in that sense we can help kids better prepare for their future by knowing how to dress appropriately for things,' Shoemaker said.

The school district dress code's ban on 'extreme clothing' lists 'revealing shorts, skirts, dresses, tank shirts, halter or crop tops, spaghetti straps, etc.'
