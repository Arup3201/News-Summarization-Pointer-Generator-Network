Just days after penning a powerful and heartbreaking article that detailed how her entire family was deported when she was just a child, Orange Is the New Black star Diane Guerrero had the chance to meet President Barack Obama.

Making this meeting even more amazing for the young star was that it happened right after President Obama delivered a historic speech that called for sweeping reforms in immigration law and delayed the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants.

Guerrero saw both her parents and her brother sent back to Colombia when she was just 14-years-old.

Reforms: In his speech, President Obama (above) urged Americans to do the right thing and welcome 'strangers'

Guerrero detailed the struggle of losing her parents in an open letter published by the Los Angeles Times earlier this week, in which she also urged President Obama to provide deportation relief for families across the country, something he announced he would be doing in is speech Thursday evening. 

The actress not only got to meet President Obama, but also got a front row seat for the speech, and a chance to embrace him afterwards.

A clearly emotional Guerrero, who admitted that because of the distance she is no longer very close with her family, could be seen holding back tears. 

Embrace: Guerrero had hoped President Obama would make the changes he announced he would be making in his speech on Thursday

Grateful: After the speech, guerrero took to twitter to thank President Obama

'Thanks @BarackObama 4giving hope to U.S citizen children growing up like me, fearing family deportation,' she wrote on Twitter following his speech.

She later added, 'What a historical moment! A step in the right direction. Thank you to my community!' 

Though President Obama's new plan does not necessarily offer a route for many immigrants to obtain citizenship, it will allow millions to legally work in the United States.

In good company: Guerrero also had the chance to meet actor Wilmer Valderrama (above), who was also at the speech on Thursday 

The President attempted to appeal to Americans last night saying, 'We shall not oppress a stranger for we know the heart of a stranger — we were strangers once, too.'

Many conservative lawmakers and members of the GOP are now accusing him of abusing his office. 

Giovernor Rick Perry of Texas has even said his state may sue President Obama
