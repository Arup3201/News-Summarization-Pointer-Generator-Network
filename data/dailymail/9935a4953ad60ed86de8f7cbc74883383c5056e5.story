Thousands of people have 'lionized' Christopher Dorner since the manhunt was launched last week and his death

Experts say people are attracted to the ex-Los Angeles Police Department because he was an underdog and compared the week-long manhunt as like watching a real-life Django Unchained.

Some conspiracy theorists were still speculating today that Dorner, 33, who was accused of killing four people, is still alive and fled to Mexico or faked his own death.

Supporters have seized Dormer's 15,000-word manifesto as proof he was a man seeking justice.

In it, Dorner describes being a victim of racism and claims he was fired from the LAPD for trying to expose corruption and brutality within the force.

Marc Lamont Hill, associate professor of English at Columbia University, said Dorner has become a 'real-life superhero to many people.'

He told CNN: 'People aren't rooting for him to kill innocent people, they're rooting for somebody who was wronged to get a kind of revenge against the system.

'It is almost like watching Django Unchained in real life.'

Experts say Dorner's antihero status has fuelled support. Supporters such as Chantel Cardiel, pictured, stood with signs pleading with Los Angeles police not to kill Dorner

The story has exposed anger from some people about alleged police corruption and brutality

The biggest US manhunt in recent memory began after Dorner allegedly killed Keith Lawrence, 27, and Monica Quan, 28, the daughter of a police captain who assisted Dorner during his disciplinary hearings in 2007.

Four days later he allegedly shot two officers in Riverside, California, killing one and injuring another.

He went on the run for five days before the firefight at a cabin in Big Bear where Dorner was hiding.

The cabin caught alight and Dorner died.

Since his death the internet has been awash with the views of supporters.

One supporter wrote on the Facebook pages: 'He killed CORRUPT cops, cops kill INNOCENT people!'

On Twitter, @Rep_DanGordon wrote: 'Badges don't give cops special rights. This is what happens when a corrupt system pushes an honest man too far.'

Another, going by the name gR1zZ_LBC wrote: 'I don't agree with what he did but I hope they never find him lol.'

Some supporters claim Dorner was an honest man who was fighting corruption and racism

One man, called @becomeyoung wrote on the social networking site: 'Apparently burning people alive is now considered appropriate behavior for the police. Judge, jury and executioner.'

Dorner died after the cabin caught fire during a shootout with police.

One Facebook user wrote: 'Imagine burning someone alive and not even knowing for sure who it is.'

BuzzFeed Radio host Jack Moore said the way the story unfolded made it even more attractive to supporters.

He told CNN that the Dorner story 'resembles a Denzel Washington movie where someone is wronged, and he stands up for himself and goes down in a blaze of glory.'

The drama has also exposed high levels of anger at police forces across the country.

One Dorner supporter wrote that anger levels are so high that more police will be killed.

He said: 'It's about to get worse... police killings is about to rise believe it or not it gone happen.

'Police all work together... how do you win... if u say something and the police say something who you think they done believe sure as hell not us.'

Civil rights attorney Connie Rice spoke on radio to say that some residents were 'lionizing and admiring Dorner.'

She told CNN before the reforms - brought in after the LA riots that were sparked by the beating of Rodney King in 1991 - the relationship between the black community and police was a 'state of war'.

However she said things had improved and said the black community could never 'condone this kind of violence.'
