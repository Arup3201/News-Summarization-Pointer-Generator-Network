Theresa May could be given powers to sack Police and Crime Commissioners under new laws following a series of scandals 

Failing crime tsars could be sacked by the Home Secretary under radical plans to rescue the Conservatives’ tarnished law and order policy.

Police and Crime Commissioners can currently only be removed at the ballot box every four years, but a series of scandals has prompted a rethink.

Theresa May joined the chorus of calls for South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright to stand down last week after he was implicated in Rotherham’s failure to tackle the sex abuse of thousands of young girls.

Kent PCC Ann Barnes also faced calls to quit after a documentary showed her struggling to explain her role and embarrassing her chief constable.

And last week Bedfordshire’s Olly Martins was suspended by Labour while he faces possible criminal charges over leaking sensitive information about a death to his partner.

Now a senior group of elected crime tsars is drawing up ideas to improve their own accountability between elections. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that among the options are:

The proposals, to be submitted to the Home Office by the end of the year, will prove controversial as they would dilute the independence of the role.

But sources said reform was needed as the PCC ‘brand’, which got off to a bad start when only 15 per cent of voters turned out in the £75 million elections two years ago, was being damaged by recent scandals.

One senior PCC said: ‘If somebody doesn’t resign, in extreme cases the Home Secretary should be able to recall the person and kick them out.

‘We are the ones who most keenly feel the concerns [in the wake of the South Yorkshire case].’

Liberal Democrats have joined Labour in indicating they would scrap PCCs completely at the next Election and return to a system similar to the old police authorities, where power is in the hands of a group of councillors rather than an individual.

The Tories, however, may give PCCs more responsibilities. Next month the tsars will take control of victims’ services and it is hoped they will eventually run integrated ‘blue light’ services – police, fire and ambulance.

Policing Minister Mike Penning said: ‘PCCs are elected. They are held to account by the most effective check on any politician – the ballot box.’
