Naughty: The plates have been banned based on the likelihood that they will cause offence

The DVLA has banned what they deem to be 'poor taste' number plates which use number and letter combination to spell out rude words or phrases.

Staff at the roads regulator have sifted through thousands of potentially offensive combinations to rule on which risque combinations should not be allowed.

Most of the selections were censored because they were judged to have been deliberately put together to form swear words.

Combinations using the most recent 63 plates as well as the upcoming 14plates were taken into account.

The 14-plate, which is due to start appearing on new cars in March next year, is a boon for personalised numberplate fans as 14 can be made to appear to read as a I or an A. 

Censors have been busy banning certain letter combinations from the road - with many plates starting with PR, SH and SL having to be scratched.

This includes such variations such as PR14 CCK, SH14 TTY, SP14 STK, SL14 AGS and SK14 NKY.

The 14-reg is also responsible for plates such as AL14 LAH, CR14 PLE and BU14 SHT.

In addition, a fear over glorifying terrorism has seen any numberplate ending with J14 HAD also being vetoed.

The 63-plates, which went live in September, also saw the experts at the DVLA busy banning the ruder combinations, where the numbers can be made to look like a G or a B.

This included variations of numberplates such as BU63 GER, FA63 HAG, HU63 NOB and NO63 END.

Also vetoed were OR63 ASM, OR63 YYY and a host of combinations that start VA63. SO63 OMY was also outlawed as was PU63 RTY and LU63 FER.

FA63 HAG      HU63 NOB     NO63 END

LU63 FER      PU63 RTY      OM63 WTF

The experts even have to consider common text language abbreviations, with OM63 WTF one example of a modern phrase reference, which has also been outlawed.

A special group of people called the 
DVLA's Propriety Group sit down for meetings every year to discuss which
plates should not be allowed.

A
DVLA Spokesperson said: 'The vast majority of registration numbers are 
made available but we have a responsibility to ensure that the 
combinations used do not cause offence.

'We
try to identify combinations that may cause offence and having 
considered the appropriateness of these registration numbers we have 
withdrawn them as they could cause offence or embarrassment on the 
grounds of political or racial sensitivities or are in poor taste.'
