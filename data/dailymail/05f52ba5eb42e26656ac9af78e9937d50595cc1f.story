Planners who wrongly allowed a millionaire to build an enormous beach hut on Britain's World Heritage Coast have been officially rebuked.

Council officials merely rubber-stamped businessman Simon Saunders' application to demolish a timber chalet he had bought for £235,000 on the Jurassic Coast and replace it.

Blundering staff only realised that the new hut was twice the size of the original, dwarfing its neighbours, when it was half built and residents in West Bexington, Dorset, complained.

'Monstrosity': Bungling council planners gave millionaire Simon Saunders planning permission to build a beach hut that is twice the size of its neighbours on Dorset's Jurassic Coast

Even then nothing could be done about the 'monstrosity' because it had been given planning permission.

Now the Local Government Ombudsman, Dr Jane Martin, has found West Dorset District Council guilty of maladministration causing injustice.

The council will have to write letters of apology to all those who complained about its decision.

It must also fork out £3,000 on 'countryside projects' in the area to make amends for the blunder. 

'By the book': Simon Saunders said no objections were received when he applied for planning permission but that he found the council 'shambolic'

The ombudsman said: 'The council failed to spot gross error in plans for a replacement beach chalet at West Bexington.

'Its failure to recognise the true extent of the proposed development at the planning stage has resulted in a building which is incongruous in its setting on the Heritage Coastline and within the designated area of outstanding natural beauty.

'The principal injustice for the complainants is a wider sense of public outrage at the building now permitted in this area.'

Mr Saunders, who owns the Ariel Motor Company which makes the Atom sports car, bought the 1930s chalet in 2007 and submitted plans to demolish it and build a new hut.

The new chalet is 26ft by 24ft and is made out of oak and red cedar wood.

It has a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, sitting room and storage cupboard, running water and drainage.

John Aldred, 55, who lives in a bungalow nearby and complained about the chalet, feels the council has been let off lightly.

He said: 'It just does not fit in and has completely destroyed the integrity of a lovely little row of chalets.

'I
have heard people visiting saying they have come to see this unusual 
hut - it seems as if this once desolate piece of heritage coastline is 
now viewed as a bit of a joke.'

Mr Saunders said he was not surprised the council had been crticised by 
the ombudsman as he found them 'shambolic' to deal with.

Dwarfing its neighbours: Planners only realised Simon Saunders' chalet was twice the size of the original when it was half-built, and it was already too late

'Gross Error': West Dorset Council has been officially rapped by Ombudsman Dr Jane Martin after Mr Saunders was wrongly allowed to go ahead and build the oversized chalet

He said he submitted his planning application for the chalet in good faith and it received no objections from anyone at the time.

'When we put the application in it was all done by the book,' he said.

'We even called the council to see if they wanted to discuss it but they weren't interested. It was approved with no objections locally.

'If people did have objections to it they should have raised them at the time. It was halfway through building the chalet that a guy started to complain and the council came out to measure it and they found it built to plan.

'It has been built 100 per cent to plan, if anything it is slightly undersized.

'We spend a lot of time down there and often pick up litter from the coastal path and the beach. Hopefully the council can spend the £3,000 on cleaning the area up.'
