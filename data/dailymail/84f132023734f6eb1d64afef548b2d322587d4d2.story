The star wattage of the celebrity front row threatened to outshine the blinging gowns at Saturday night's Julien Macdonald's show.

Ladylike supermodel Coco Rocha perched next to a not so prim Abbey Clancy, whose sheer dress was strictly NSFW, while Millie Macintosh shared selfies with Laura Mvula, actress Samantha Barks and singer Eliza Doolittle.

The Strictly cast were there en masse, too, to support their designer dancing partner-in-crime, as well as Julien's family, all the way from the valleys making the most of the pre-show cocktail reception as they celebrated his da's 80th birthday.

And what a way to celebrate, as his son Julien treated the audience to a dazzling collection of glamorous British fashion inside the imposing Royal Courts of Justice

Heavy metals opened the Julien Macdonald show

Heavy beading created optical illusions

The heavy bass on the stereo as the show opened was a prelude to the heavy metal all over the catwalk.

A dramatic display of evening dresses began with a collection of gold, silver and pewter gowns featuring knitted, beaded, blinging mosaics and a LOT of mesh, ergo flesh.

To follow there were more disco-ready dresses (the Julien Macdonald woman doesn’t wear trousers) – inspired by fabulous architecture and stained windows according to the designer – in ruby red, shimmering emerald green and electric blue.

Celebrity stylist Nicole Smallwood said at the show: ' Julien never disappoints, with his use of glimmer and sparkle alongside carefully placed transparent fabrics making for a spectacular show.

'My favourite piece was the petrol blue dress which I'm sure we'll see sauntering down a red carpet or two in coming weeks.'

The LBD was given a sexy makeover for AW14

Glistening snakeskin was a theme

Glamorous shoe brand Gina provided sky-high heels

This peacock-inspired gown was a hit

The crowd-pleasing dress was seriously daring

Oriental detail showed skill

An electric blue knitted dress was daring but demure

A ruby red mini dress added a jolt of colour

A knitted dress shimmered on the runway

Flirty feathers, crochet detail and even a bit of suede made it into the show here and there but it was the floor-sweepers that had the crowd hooked with delicate peacock and oriental embellishment showing off Macdonald's mastery of detail.

Before the show Macdonald addressed the willowy models, whose hair was slicked back with gel and faces were covered in shine: 'I picked you because you're beautiful on the inside and on the outside. Be strong, be empowered and have a f***ing amazing time!'

Celebrity stylist Nicole Smallwood said: ' Julien never fails to impress with glimmer and careful use of fabrics.'

The dramatic finale received a standing ovation from many of the celebrities sitting on the front row, and designer Julien was delighted with the response

Show-stopping gowns like Julien's need serious hair and make-up to complement them.

Step up glam squad Val Garland and James Pecis who gave Saturday's models a fierce disco makeover before they hit the catwalk.

Garland
 is an industry heavyweight, having worked on models such as Kate Moss 
and Georgia May Jagger and creating countless Vogue covers. Working with
 L'Oreal Paris for Julien's show she didn't hold back, giving the girls 
dramatic eyes and glistening lips, cheeks and skin.

'It's
 all about the eye,' declared Val backstage, just before she bawled 
at one of her interns for snapping Instragram shots rather than 
powdering a model, 'I am using everything you shouldn't use: 8 hour 
cream, lip gloss, oil... but these looks only need to last a few minutes
 on the catwalk.'

Mood boards for the artists to work from were posted around the hair and make-up stations backstage at the Royal Courts of Justice

While 
designer Julien's inspiration was architecture and stained glass windows
 Val's muse was a bit more straightforward fashion: Nineties model 
Guinevere as she appeared on The Face magazine in 1999.

Val
 said: 'The idea is to create the impression of a bleached eyebrow with a
 dramatic eye. My inspiration was Julien's girl Guinevere and a bit 
of the new romantics. It's high octane, think glorious, glamorous, very 
Julien Macdonald.'

One of 
Val's team of make-up artists was dispatched with a can of glistening 
body spray to attack the models arms and legs: 'What's in it? Heaven 
only knows, it's a trade secret,' she said as she added a golden glow to
 the troupe of teenage skin.

Hair,
 overseen by the handsome James Pecis was hi-shine but low maintenance 
slicked back into a glossy and futuristic tangle within minutes of the 
models arriving from their last show.

As
 he piled on the mousee, hairspray and gel (applied with a paintbrudh of 
course) Pecis said: 'The place is so massive and big, it can really take
 a look. Julien's gowns are so beautiful, we needed something a little 
bit tough to break it up a bit - as soon as you add an up-do it can go 
'lady' really fast.'
