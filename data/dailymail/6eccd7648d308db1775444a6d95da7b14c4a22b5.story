A robber who stumbled and shot a medical student as he raided a fraternity residence has been found guilty of murder.

Dajeon Franklin, 22, had no reaction when a jury convicted him of killing 25-year-old Paul DeWolf in Michigan University's Phi Rho Sigma house last year.

He was also found guilty of three home invasions and unlawful possession of a firearm.

Killed: Paul DeWolf, an aspiring pilot, was sleeping in his basement bedroom when the three men broke in

Washtenaw County Court heard Franklin and two friends, 20-year-old Joei Jordan, and 21-year-old Shaquille Jones, broke into the medical fraternity in the early hours of July 24, 2013, and stumbled upon DeWolf sleeping in his basement bedroom.

DeWolf and Franklin struggled, and the gun Franklin was holding went off, striking DeWolf in the neck, prosecutors said. 

DeWolf's body was found at the fraternity house on July 24, 2013, after he failed to show up for work at a hospital.

'That was very hard,' Paul DeWolf's father Thom DeWolf told Mlive after the verdict. 'You're sitting on pins and needles waiting for the answer. You think there would be some elation or happiness, but there's not. All it does, it's confirming Paul's death.'

Walter White, Franklin's lawyer, questioned the evidence presented against his client, asking during his closing argument: 'What evidence do we have that Dajeon Franklin was even there and even part of this?'

Franklin will be sentenced November 19.

His friends and family members left the courtroom in tears, while DeWolf's supporters celebrated with hugs.

DeWolf was from the southwestern Michigan community of Schoolcraft and a graduate of Grand Valley State University.

He was a reservist second lieutenant and had planned to join the Air Force full time after graduation. 

Jordan and Jones are scheduled to stand trial early next year.
