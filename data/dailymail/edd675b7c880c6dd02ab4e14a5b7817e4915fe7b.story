The oldest living teacher in America has just turned 100 - and shows no signs of slowing down.

Home economics teacher Agnes Zhelesnik, affectionately known as 'granny' to her pupils, celebrated reaching her centenary on Sunday.

Colleagues threw a special birthday party for the much-loved teacher and invited more than 100 present and former pupils.

Happy birthday: More than 100 present and former pupils joined Agnes Zhelesnik to celebrate her turning 100 years old

The centenarian, who still works five
 days a week at Sundance grade school in North Plainfield, New Jersey, 
vowed that as long as her body holds up she'll carry on imparting 
knowledge to her pupils.

And judging by the reaction of students, age has not prevented her from creating thoroughly captivating and entertaining lessons.

They created a special birthday card for their beloved 'granny' with touching messages of thanks for her dedication.

One of her pupils told CBS news: 'I just think she loves the children. She puts the love into her
 cooking. No, you cant taste love, but you can feel love.'

Another
 added that she was still sprightly and said he was amazed she still had the energy to come into the class room.

Fulfilment: Agnes Zhelesnik has been teaching since she was 81 year of age and wants to carry on as long as her health holds up

Agnes started working at the school at the age 
of 81, after she had finished bringing up her own children and grandchildren.

Today, she's so devoted to these kids, she hasn't even called in 
sick since she was 98.

She told CBS news: 'My husband didnâ€™t approve of working -- he wanted me to watch the children.'

'And all the children love her, because she's so nice, so compassionate,' says another. 'She perseveres a lot.'

'What else is there in life?' Agnes asks. 'Children make the whole world.'

From 1920 to 1929, when Agnes Zhelesnik would have been at school, mass education in America was increasingly important.

In that period compulsory schooling until 16 became the norm.

Child labour was being reduced meaning more children stayed in school, but in 1920 only 17 per cent of those who stayed actually graduated.

School textbooks were censored however.

John Scopes, a high school biology teacher, was charged with illegally teaching the theory of evolution at the Scopes trial of 1925.

Mrs Zhelesnik was forced to leave school at 16 in 1930 and take a job soldering at the American Can Company.

She wasn't alone and the Great Depression of that decade saw many changes in education.

Only half of those between the ages of fourteen and sixteen were attending school in the period.

Teachers were losing their jobs and the school year was cut back.
