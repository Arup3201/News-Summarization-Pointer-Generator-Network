The horrifying moment an 87-car freight train in Louisiana careered into an 18-wheel tractor trailer stuck on a crossing has been caught on camera.

Juanita Schulze exclaimed 'holy Mother of Moo Moo' as the train rammed into the trailer, which got stuck on tracks at a crossing in Mer Rouge on Sunday in the north-east of the state.

A terrifying crunch can be heard as the train smashes through the trailer, which was carrying a crane rig.

Several of the train's cars contained toxic substances and Ms Schulze's husband, David, who runs a garden business in Texas, quickly reversed their car, telling his wife 'we've got chem leaks'.

'Oh my God, tell me he [the truck driver] got out,' Mrs Schulze exclaims, clearly shocked by what she's witnessed.

'It was like something off TV,' she adds.

The footage shows the enormous train grind to a halt, with the truck wreckage strewn alongside the track.

At the end of the clip white gas can be seen billowing out from a smashed container.

The smash happened right in front of the town police station, so the police were immediately on the scene, Mr Schulze said. 

The subsequent clean-up operation by Hazmat crews continued into Monday, state police said.

The engineer and conductor were injured in the accident, which derailed two engines and 17 cars, with one airlifted to hospital.

Union Pacific Railroad Co. officials said the conductor's injuries weren't considered life-threatening. He was being treated at a hospital in Shreveport. They say the engineer suffered minor injuries.   

Mer Rouge Police Chief Mitch Stephens said about 50 houses were evacuated for about two hours due to concerns that a tank car of pressurized argon gas might explode. 

Another tank of argon, an inert gas used to fill light bulbs and in arc welding, leaked until it was empty, he said.

Stephens said the trailer got stuck on the tracks crossing Highway 165, but trucker Daniel Shackleford, of Freedom, Missouri, was unhurt. Shackleford was hauling a rig owned by Taylor Truck Line of Northfield, Minnesota.

'He saw the train coming and he jumped out of the truck,' Stephens said. 

He added that there have been three or four train crashed in the town in the past few years, according to Knoe.com.
