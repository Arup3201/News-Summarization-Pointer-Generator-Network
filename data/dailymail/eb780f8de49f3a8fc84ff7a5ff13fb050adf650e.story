An archaeological row over when exactly mankind began leaving Africa has intensified with a new study dismissing one of the main theories.

New genetic and archaeological findings suggest mankind only left Africa within the last 60,000 years rather than up to 120,000 years ago, according to a study.

The two main theories for the timing of exodus put it either side of the Mount Toba supereruption of about 74,000 years ago but one of them, according to the study, is worthless.

Lake Toba was formed from a volcanic eruption 74,000 years ago but did mankind leave Africa before it or afterwards? The eruption forms the fault-line between scientific theories on when people started colonising South East Asia.

In an unusually strong scientific put-down, archaeologists involved in the latest study claim the theory that Man left Africa the before the volcanic eruption has 'no evidence'.

Genetic evidence, they say, only backs up the idea that man left Africa within the last 60,000 years.

Had colonisation of South East Asia and other parts of the world taken place much earlier, there would have been genetic traces surviving today.

The 'lack of any discernable evidence' of such genetic traces, said the researchers, 'poses a final obstacle to the hypothesis of an early, pre-Toba modern human colonization of South Asia'.

Stone tools and symbols like perforated beads and artistic engravings that had previously been used to support the pre-Toba theory actually date from 25,000 years after the eruption, they said.

Prof Sir Paul Mellars, from the University of Cambridge, and other researchers presented their findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

'We find no evidence, either genetic or archaeological, for a very early modern human colonization of South Asia, before the Toba eruption,' they concluded.

A view of Lake Toba which is 55 miles long and up to 1,600 feet deep. It was formed by a supervolcano 74,000 years ago. Ash from the volcano has been found thousands of miles away may have caused a nuclear winter.

'All of the available evidence supports a much later colonization beginning 50â€“55 ka [50-55,000 years ago.

The eruption of Mount Toba in Sumatra 74,000 years ago is the biggest for the last two million years.

It spewed out ten billion tons of ash
and left a huge hole in the ground which today forms Lake Toba - 
fifty-five miles long, twenty miles wide and over 1600 feet deep.

At the centre is Samosir Island - a popular tourist spot and the largest island-within-an-island in the world.

'We see no reason to believe that the initial modern human colonization of South and Southeast Asia was distinct from the process that is now well documented for effectively all of the other regions of Eurasia from 60 ka [60,000 years ago] onward.'

They said in their summary: 'We show here this "pre-Toba" dispersal model is in serious conflict with both the most recent genetic evidence from both Africa and Asia and the archaeological evidence from South Asian sites.

'We present an alternative model based on a combination of genetic analyses and recent archaeological evidence from South Asia and Africa.

'These data support a coastally oriented dispersal of modern humans from eastern Africa to southern Asia about 60,000 to 50,000 years ago.'
