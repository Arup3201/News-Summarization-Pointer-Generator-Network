Shocking details of rape and brutality have emerged from a Las Vegas house of horrors where the bodies of a woman and her young daughter were found.

Police are continuing to collect evidence from the home after a 9-year-old boy reportedly came to his school on Monday and told teachers that his mother and older sister had been killed by his dad.

At the boy's home less than a mile away, they found the blood-spattered bodies of 38-year-old Ignacia Martinez and his 10-year-old sister Karla Martinez.

However, police have now rejected the boy's claim that his father was behind the killings.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Deputy Chief Jim Owens labelled original reports of the father's involvement as inaccurate, telling the Las Vegas Review-Journal: 'I wouldn't print that'.

Police said during a press conference yesterday that young Karla was raped before she and her mother were savagely beaten to death.

Ignacia Martinez's 4-year-old son was also found in the home, but was not harmed.

The father, Arturo Martinez, who works as an electrician and boxing trainer in the area, was also found severely beaten - but alive.

He is currently fighting for his life at a nearby hospital.

Authorities believe the boy was in a state of shock when he arrived at Mabel Hoggard Elementary School near Washington Avenue in Las Vegas shortly before 9am.

Las Vegas police said no one has been ruled out in terms of involvement with the murders and homicide detectives are looking at every possibility.

Lt Clint Nichols with the Violent Crimes Section of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement: 'While no homicide is "typical," this crime scene will take our forensic folks up to several days to process'.

'The crime scene is the entire inside of the house and the work that has to be done to process the scene is detailed'.

The murders have sent shockwaves 
through the community, especially at the Real KO Boxing Club in North 
Las Vegas, where both Arturo and Ignacia Martinez worked and were viewed
as positive role models.

Those who knew them say that the couple, both trained fighters, would not have gone quietly if attacked or robbed.

Felipe Lazos, a 16-year-old who trained at Real KO Boxing, told the Review-Journal that the attacker would have 'had to be a good fighter'.

While police have not made any arrests in the case, they also don't know for sure when the attack occurred.

Neighbor Lucinda Jackson-Griffin said
she had never heard disturbances at the home until she was woken by 
gunshots on Monday morning, but police are now saying that a gun was not
used in the killings.

Another, Juliana Maqueda-Perez,
said she heard a man screaming in English and a child crying in the 
early hours of the morning, the Review-Journal reported.

'I walked past there every day,' neighbor Dick Webb, 82, said about the house.

He said he had walked past the house less than 90 minutes before the boy arrived at school but hadn't seen anything amiss.

Police originally blocked the area around the single-story stucco home to await a warrant to enter and retrieve the bodies.

Animal control officers arrived to remove a dog from the house. An 
officer said it was not harmed but had been taken away as no one was 
there to care for it.

School
Principal Celese Rayford declined to comment, and Clark County School 
District spokeswomen provided no immediate information about the student
or whether the other 457 students in grades kindergarten through 5 were
told about the case.

Police said the two surviving children from the attack remain with Child Protective Services.

Friend and next-door neighbour Mark Groenert told Fox 5 Vegas: 'It's so sad. I knew them all. And it's sad and tragic'.
