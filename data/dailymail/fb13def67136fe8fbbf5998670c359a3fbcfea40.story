Fans at a north Texas baseball game seemed ready to brave the weather on Thursday -- despite a looming tornado seen behind the stadium's left-field wall.

The Frisco RoughRiders were scheduled to play the Northwest Arkansas Naturals on Thursday.

The dangerous weather forced a postponement, MLB reports, with the score tied at 2-2 in the game's third inning.

Strangely, the RoughRiders' website lists the reason for the cancellation as 'rain.'

The makeup game against the Naturals is set to take place on Friday night.

Thursday's game against the Northwest Arkansas Naturals was postponed due to 'rain' -- and not the looming tornado seen here

The damage: The baseball-sized hail in Denton, Texas wrecked several cars parked out in the open on Thursday

Nearby Denton, Texas was battered
 with baseball-sized hail as a large swath of the central U.S. 
experienced severe storms and tornado warnings.

Severe
 weather warnings were issued from the Southern Plains into the Midwest 
Thursday evening in a system expected to stretch into Friday morning.

Denton,  located 40 miles north of Dallas, was hit the 
hardest after experiencing two monster hail storms Thursday.

The first shower hit around 4pm and produced baseball-sized hail which caused damage to cars and buildings.

The parking lot at Strickland Middle School in north Denton looked 'like a war zone' after the first round of hail while the fields at nearby Texas Women's University were turned completely white.

TWU reported damage to several buildings and was in lockdown at one point. Buildings at the University of North Texas' campus were also reportedly damaged.

Retired journalist Keith Shelton lives near TWU and described the terrifying shower to the Denton Record-Chronicle.

'It didn't last very long but the yard was covered with what looked like baseballs,' Mr Shelton said. 'It sounded like someone was beating on the roof with a sledgehammer.'

Jennifer McAlister was driving to the grocery store with her three children in the car when the storm hit.

She says she tried to find shelter at a fast-food drive-thru but didn't make it in time and her windshield broke in four places.

'The kids thought it was going to come through the glass and get us,' Ms McAlister said.

A second hail storm hit less than two hours later, producing smaller egg-sized hail.

So far, no injuries have been reported.

However, the storms did knock out electricity for at least 2,000 customers at some point in the night.

There were also warnings of four tornadoes in Denton County, with spottings near to the north, west and south of town.

Conditions seemed to be worse in Hunt County where the Sheriff's Department said two homes were 'gone' around 8:30pm, without elaborating on what caused the damage.

A flash flood warning was also put in place for Denton County until 9:15pm.
