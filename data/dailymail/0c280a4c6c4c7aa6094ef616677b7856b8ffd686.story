A raging inferno engulfed a southwest Ohio home early Friday, killing three children as their mother screamed for help and their father tried in vain to rescue them.

The parents, Crystal Flores and Michael Ortiz, and their two other kids, boys ages 9 and 2, were taken to hospitals.

The blaze killed another boy and his two older sisters, said Deputy Chief Ken Runyan of the Hamilton Fire Department.

Innocents: The trio of kids who were killed in the house fire were identified Friday as (L to R) Yesenia Flores-Ortiz, 12, Siclalia Flores-Ortiz, 10, and Alexander Flores-Ortiz, 7

The casualties were identified Friday afternoon as Alexander Flores-Ortiz, 7; Siclalia Flores-Ortiz, 10, and Yesenia Flores-Ortiz, 12. 

Firefighters using ladders found the children on the second floor of the home in Hamilton, about 20 miles north of Cincinnati. 

Hurt: The children's mother, Crystal Flores, was taken to a hospital with injuries 

Their father was flown to a Cincinnati hospital after emergency responders found him as he tried to reach the children. He was burned and expected to remain hospitalized for days, said his brother, Leonardo Flores.

The children's mother, Crystal Flores, and a 9-year-old boy were taken at a local hospital. A 2-year-old boy was sent with them.

The mother was released from the hospital at 6am. Her 9-year-old was not harmed in the fire.

Neighbor Liz Delk, who lives down the street, recalled getting up for work around 2.30am, peering out the window and seeing the woman running from the home at 135 Franklin Street.

'We heard her screaming and it was just up in flames,' Delk said, adding, 'There was nothing that could be done.'

Several neighbors called 911, and fire trucks were there within a few minutes, Delk said.

Authorities had no immediate information on what caused the fire, which will be investigated by the state fire marshal's office.

According to Mr Flores, who is Michael Ortiz's brother, his sister-in-law told him the family's Christmas tree had sparked the blaze, reported The Journal News.

Flores, who is among a large group of relatives that live along the same street, also said that the family had lived in the home for a while. He was quiet as he and others surveyed the scene later Friday morning.

'I feel very bad,' said Flores, 40. 'This is my family.'

Debbie Batchelder knew the children from volunteering with an independent Christian ministry in the neighborhood called Freedom Chapel. 

She said the children often attended Wednesday evening gatherings where they would read Bible stories, make crafts and eat with other children, most of them Mexican-American.

She said that when this Wednesday's session ended, the family's 7-year-old, Alexander, told her: 'You didn't give me a hug!' So she hugged him.

'That was the very last thing he said to me,' she said outside the home Friday. 'It's heartbreaking. You feel helpless.'

Batchelder told Cincinnati.com that the family lost a baby in recent years to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and a few years ago, the Floreses were forced out of their home due to an electrical fire.

Siclali and Alexander attended Bridgeport Elementary School, while sister Yesenia was a seventh-grader at Garfield Middle School.

The American Red Cross will be assisting the survivors of the blaze once they are discharged from the hospital, providing them with shelter, food and clothes, as well as financial aid for the funerals.

A family friend has launched an online fundraiser hoping to raise $5,000 to help the Floreses with expenses.
