Furious: Mr Timothy Coupe (pictured) swore at traffic warden, Amy Harrison, and shot her with a water pistol after she issued him a parking ticket

A furious businessman unleashed a foul-mouthed tirade at the female traffic warden who gave him a parking ticket, before squirting her with a water pistol.

Timothy Coupe 'humiliated' civil enforcement officer, Amy Harrison, by pulling out a toy gun and shooting water at her face and chest - causing the shirt she was wearing to go see-through.

The furious 53-year-old reacted to a £25 fine he'd received from Miss Harrison for parking illegally by a Boots pharmacy on Compston Road in Ambleside, Cumbria.

His Land Rover was parked in a loading bay near the store on June 18, when he was approached by the on-duty Harrison.

When she told him that he couldn't park there, he rudely put his finger to his mouth and gestured at her to 'shush', Kendal Magistrates Court heard.

Miss Harrison walked towards the front of his car to take down the registration number when Coupe shouted at her: 'What the fu** are you doing? I'm not f****** accepting that.'

When Miss Harrison told him to expect his penalty in the post, he continued: 'Do you look in the mirror when you get ready?

'Get a proper f****** job... You're an ugly f****** c**t.'

A tearful Amy Harrison then described to the court how he pulled out the water pistol and squirted it at her.

She said: 'He pointed a water pistol at me and squirted it in my face and on my shirt.

'It was humiliating and embarrassing. I can't tell you how distressing it is to have a grown man shout those words at you. 

'I was wearing a white shirt and it went see through in the middle of Ambleside.'

Coupe, of Clappersgate, Cumbria, denied using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour to cause harassment, harm or distress.

He dismissed Miss Harrison's account as 'fiction'. When asked why she would make the story up, he replied: 'Maybe she felt undermined by me in my big posh Land Rover.'

Coupe claimed he had the water pistol to reprimand his Newfoundland puppy, who would bark loudly when people approached his car.

He described himself as a 'gentleman who attended a public school' and insisted the only time he's picked up the toy pistol was to squirt his dog.

But magistrates found the business director guilty and ordered him to pay a £1,000 fine and £400 in compensation, along with court costs and a victim surcharge.

Suzie Kavanagh, for Coupe, said: 'He is a man of good character and has no previous convictions.

'He is recently divorced and is currently in a poor financial situation. He currently earns around £18,800 per annum.'

An unsympathetic Magistrate, Ann Howson, told Mr Coupe: 'There was no reduction of the fine because of a not guilty plea, and you have the means to pay this within 28 days.

'Miss Harrison was a credible witness whose recollection of the incident, even today, caused distress.'
