Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay will soon be facing new competition in the kitchen - from his estranged father-in-law.

Chris Hutcheson and his son Adam are launching a chain of healthy ­fast-food restaurants called Scoffs.

The eateries will reportedly serve 'British tapas' for diet-conscious office workers and the first one will be opened in central London.

Hutcheson and Adam, who used to be head of pubs at Ramsay’s restaurant group, expects the chain to grow to 20 to 30 restaurants within 18 months.

His adviser David Rawlinson said: 'Chris and Adam have an incredible wealth of experience in catering and plan to roll out the concept.'

Hutcheson was dismissed in October 2010 after Kitchen Nightmares star Ramsay accused him  of hacking into private emails and plundering £1.4million from his restaurant empire to finance his serial womanising.

Ramsay also claimed that Hutcheson put his wife and son on the payroll and wrote five-figure cheques to himself.

Hutcheson, who denied the claims, branded Ramsay a fame-obsessed 'monster' and sued him for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages.

Their feud was settled after Ramsay,  married to Hutcheson’s daughter Tana, reportedly paid £2million in February to buy his father-in-law’s 30 per cent stake in the business.

Ramsay previously wrote an open letter criticising Hutcheson, who hit back claiming the cook was a monster and he knew where Gordon’s 'bodies are buried'.

It was not until May last year that the astonishing story behind Ramsay's decision to sack his business partner emerged when the High Court lifted a gagging order Hutcheson had taken out to hush up his double life.

Tana Ramsay was among the last in her family to learn that for more than three decades Hutcheson had had a second, secret family after fathering two children by his mistress Frances Collins.

She is one of a string of women with whom Hutcheson allegedly betrayed his wife Greta, by whom he has four children, including Tana. 

Ramsay’s feud with his father-in-law has cost him at least £6 million. 

Papers filed at Companies House show that he paid out reorganisation costs of £2.4 million, wrote off a £1.7 million loan on a gastropub owned by Ramsay and Hutcheson and made a pre-tax loss of £4.4 million up to August 31, 2011.

Last December Ramsay was awarded £250,000 costs after a judge ruled that Hutcheson, Tana's sister Orlanda Butland and her brother Adam were liable for breach of confidence after hacking into personal emails and company computers.
