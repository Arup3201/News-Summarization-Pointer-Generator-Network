She may have been rumoured to have been given a pair of $100,000 (£52,433) earrings from her billionaire 'lover' James Packer, but it seems Miranda Kerr is more focused on the simple things in life. 

The 31-year-old model, who is well known for her holistic approach, has written a spiritual blog post on her Kora Organics website.

Citing this time of year as her favourite because it's the 'season of goodwill and gratitude' the mother-of-one goes on to urge her fans to 'encourage kindness' in all that they do.

As well as career triumphs, the model's personal life seems to have gone from strength to strength in 2014

Writing on her Kora website, Miranda says: 'This time of year is one of my favourites, mostly because it's the season of goodwill and gratitude. 

'It's a time to pause and reflect on the year that's been, celebrate hard work, acknowledge the lessons we've learnt, and thank all who've guided and supported us along the way. 

'As we head into 2015, I ask that we all continue to consider the impact we have on each other's lives, and how a simple act of kindness can transform another person's day. 

'Encourage kindness in all that you do.'

Miranda certainly has much to reflect on after a highly successful year, which saw her replace Gisele as the face of H&M, sign lucrative contracts with Reebok and Wonderbra and even release her first ever music single online.

As well as her career triumphs, the model's personal life seems to have gone from strength to strength.

She and ex-husband Orlando Bloom, have remained amicable since their 2013 split, but the actor recently revealed their plan to  'come together' over Christmas for their three-year-old son Flynn.

While appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Orlando, 37, talked about his plans for the festive season.

He said: '[Flynn] is four in January. So his mom is really close, which is great. So we'll be able to do Christmas together.

Both Miranda and ex-husband Orlando Bloom have spoken about their amicable relationship, while The Hobbit actor revealed their families' plans to unite over Christmas to spend the festive season with Flynn

There is a rumoured romance between billionaire businessman James Packer (left) and Miranda (right)

'Her family, my family. We'll all kind of come together.'

Alongside this harmonious home life, Miranda has a  rumoured new love interest.

There's been little news of a romance between Miranda Kerr and James Packer since the pair were spotted holidaying on the businessman's yacht off the coast of Spain in August.

But a new report claims the love is very much alive between the famous Australians, with the casino mogul reported to have bestowed a pair of diamond earrings on the former Victoria's Secret model.
