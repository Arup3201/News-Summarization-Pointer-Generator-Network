A 45-year-old motorbike is not the most conventional way to travel from Sydney to London but Jonathan Gibson is a man on a mission.

He's determined to make it through 23 countries on the back of his vintage motorbike and it's all in a bid to get people, specifically men, talking about depression.

Mr Gibson is currently riding along the south coast of Java in Indonesia and he's about a fifth of the way through his worldwide journey.

'The route is roughly 25,000km long. I am unsure how far exactly I have come as my speedo and odometer have never worked,' Mr Gibson told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was hoping to do it in just under a year. However, due to the many bike issues I have had I am thinking it may take around 18-20 months.'

Mr Gibson's inspiration for the epic journey is to raise awareness and funds for depression via a charity called Beyond Blue.

He lost a close family member to suicide not too long ago and fears it may not be the last.

'People who ride motorcycles are not people who are the types to talk about their issues,' Mr Gibson said.

'I am hoping I can get some more conversation going, get people to take a step back and be more open. I am hoping that I can get people to talk about depression in a more open way and address some of the stigma attached to the illness.'

The young man who tragically ended his life had noted he didn't feel like he lived up to expectations and that he didn't belong, prompting Mr Gibson to ponder what it actually means to be a man. 

He packed in his career as a senior urban designer to ride his 1969 Royal Enfield Bullet 350 across the world to explore this idea of 'masculinity and manhood'  and try and find some answers.

So far he has crossed Australia, Timor and Indonesia off his itinerary but he's got a long way to go on his self made map

Next on the agenda is Malaysia and Thailand. Mr Gibson estimates it will take him roughly 18 months to get to London

So far he has crossed Australia, Timor and Indonesia off his itinerary but he's got a long way to go on his self made map. 

'I am pretty flexible with how and where I travel. Some of it was dependent on if I could get the bike through on tourist visa like Burma, but other than that I kind of just put a line across the globe,' Mr Gibson said.

As for the people he has met along the way, Mr Gibson said they were definitely interesting.

'There was the president of a motorcycle club in NSW who picked me up when I was hitching to get some spare parts. Then there was the owner of a large wok factory in Java - he also had a collection of vintage Harleys, I stayed with him for a week,' he said.
