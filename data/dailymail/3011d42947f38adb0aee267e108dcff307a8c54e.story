The bottle, which once contained Prieure des Couleys, will be sold at auction on September 13 

A bottle of Cognac drank by  Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin shortly before their deaths will be sold at auction.

The cosmonauts enjoyed the bottle of Prieure des Couleys after learning they would fly pilot and back-up respectively on the Soyuz 1 rocket launch in 1967.

Tragically, Komarov was killed after the aircraft's parachutes failed during its descent, while Gagarin died the following year in a plane crash.

Signed by each of the men and dated February 11 1967, the bottle is now being sold for £2,000 at the German auction house, Auctionata. 

When chosen for the Soyuz 1 launch, Gagarin had already become the first man to fly into space on Sputnik 1 in 1961, while Komarov had commanded the first multi-person voyage, Vokshod 1, three years earlier. 

The Russians had planned to launch the Soyuz 1 with Komarov inside and send off a second aircraft with two additional cosmonauts the following day. 

They would meet in space and dock, with Komarov expected to climb from one to the other as part of the mission to mark the 50th anniversary of the Communist revolution. 

Before blast off, several malfunctions were reportedly found within the rocket and its capsule and even Komarov, a father-of-two,  knew he would not make it back alive.  

But, in a bid to save his friend, he reportedly told demoted KGB agent, Venyamin Russayev: 'If I don't make this flight, they'll send the backup pilot instead.'

He perished trying to descend back to earth when the rocket's parachutes failed to open. 

Gagarin was banned from space flight following the incident and began training as a fighter pilot but died during a routine flight after training as a fighter pilot the following year. 

Viktoria Kisseleva of Auctionata said: 'In 1967 Yuri Gagarin and Vladimir Komarov were selected to be part of the Soyuz 1 mission.

'Gagarin was a national hero and had wanted to lead the mission but the Soviet government did not want to risk his life.

The cosmonauts were national heroes after Gagarin flew the first rocket in to space in 1961 and Komarov the first multi-crew mission in 1964

An image of the Soyuz 1 crash from Russian television shows the charred remains of the aircraft after it plummeted to earth 

Komarov's charred remains were on view in an open casket during an open funeral for the cosmonaut 

'Instead they named Komarov the mission commander.

'Despite the Cold War, the Soviet elite were never shut off completely from Western products and Gagarin managed to get hold of a bottle of fine French cognac.

The bottle is signed by both men and dated February 11 1967 

'He drank it on February 11, 1967, the day he was named in the back-up crew for Soyuz 1, probably with Komarov and the other cosmonauts chosen for the mission.

'Gagarin signed and dated the bottle on its label. 

'There are other signatures on it which we presume were those of the other cosmonauts including Komarov but we can't say for sure.

'The bottle is a sad reminder of the tragedy that befell the pair. 

'Komarov died when Soyuz 1 crashed after re-entering the Earth's atmosphere and six months later Gagarin perished while training to become a fighter pilot.

'In 1992, a German artist called Andora went to Russia and met with people who had been involved in the Soyuz mission. One of them had this bottle and sold it to Andora.

'He has spent the last 20 years compiling a collection of Soviet space flight memorabilia and has now decided to sell it.'

The auction will take place on September 13.
