Grassroots Labour supporters last night hit out at the party for overlooking working-class candidates to ‘shoehorn’ the sons and daughters of former MPs into safe seats.

A councillor attacked Labour for giving so-called ‘Red Princes’ – such as the sons of Tony Blair and Neil Kinnock – an easy ride into Parliament.

A growing number of offspring of Labour figures have either been selected as parliamentary candidates, or have put themselves forward to be an MP.

Euan Blair was linked to the Coventry North West seat, held by Labour's Geoffrey Robinson for the last 38 years, but another candidate was selected

Will Straw, Stephen Kinnock and Emily Benn – all descendants of prominent Labour politicians – will stand for the party in next May’s election.

Fabian Breckels, a Labour councillor from Bristol, said: ‘We need to tackle the issue of “Red Princes” in the Labour Party – the children of various MPs, Euan Blair and others, getting shoehorned into safe Labour seats because of who their parents are.’ 

He added: ‘They are using their celebrity and their connections to shoehorn themselves into a career for life. 

‘Politics is helping people and helping people’s lives. It’s not about an entitlement to just go and be an MP because Dad was too. I’m not saying they should never run for office. I’m saying that they should go and have a real life first.’

Will Straw, son of former Home Secretary Jack, has been selected to contest Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire, while Stephen Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil, will stand in the safe seat of Aberavon in South Wales.

Emily Benn, granddaughter of Tony, has been selected for Croydon South. 

Euan Blair reportedly has his eye on a seat, but after being linked with Coventry North West, another candidate was selected.

Former Home Secretary Jack Straw's son, Will, will also stand for Labour at the next election, amid claims by grassroots supporters that children of the party's former big-hitters are being given safer seats than candidates from working-class backgrounds
