Cristiano Ronaldo might have achieved the impossible. He might have delivered the landslide of goals it needed to fill a void in goal difference as deep as the Grand Canyon and thereby send the USA  plunging from that famous precipice of theirs.

If half the great man’s thunderous shots and leaping headers had crossed the line then Portugal would have done so too.

Inexplicably, it was not to be.

At the very least the supreme footballer of the year should have gone out of Brazil 2014 — and  perhaps departed the World Cup forever — with a hat-trick.

Yet the fates decreed he should be given only one goal. It was a trifle in return for the command performance he gave.

It
 was the winner, against a Ghana team which cast out its own demons to 
put on a thrilling show of their own. But it was not the  miracle this 
genius of a ball  conjurer deserved.

Run
 after run and shot after shot ended in seemingly impossible 
frustration. When one last brilliant, surging effort was somehow denied 
he just sat there, at first beating his fists on the turf in despair, 
then gazing around him disbelief.

If
 it is some small consolation, Ronaldo will be forever remembered for 
what he almost achieved on this sunlit afternoon, not for his failure to
 match Lionel Messi and now Neymar in World Cup goalscoring.

That
 Ronaldo, 29, could play with such desire despite carrying into this 
match his belief that Portugal were not good enough to challenge for the
 game’s greatest prize is all the more remarkable.

Kudos, also, to Ghana. They came into this match out of meltdown in their dressing room and made a splendid fight of it.

It all came to a thrilling climax but there had been as much or more turmoil going on before it started.

Tumble: Ronaldo goes down under the challenge of Ghana defender John Boye

Ronaldo
 packing in readiness for going home as soon as the game was over. Ghana
 beating him to it by sending two of their players packing before the 
kick-off.

The Africans 
flying in three million bucks in readies to stop the rest of their team 
packing up before they even found out they had not scraped through to 
the last 16.            

Never
 mind that both Portugal and Ghana still had a chance of making it to 
the knockout phase at kick-off. An outside chance, maybe, but surely one
 still worth fighting for no matter what was going on over in Recife.

At
 least Sulley Muntari thought so. The AC Milan midfielder was so upset 
with the way things were going that he physically assaulted a Ghanaian 
executive committee man during a team meeting.

Kevin-Prince
 Boateng, once of Tottenham and Portsmouth and now with Schalke, did not
 go quite that far but he did make his feelings known as to why Ghana 
were bottom of this group with a ‘vulgar verbal assault’ on manager 
James Kwesi Appiah.

The pair
 were put on the first plane out of here.  But don’t feel sorry for 
those two. Save your pity for the tens of thousands of Ghana fans who 
had travelled in the hope of seeing Africa’s day at the World Cup 
finally arrive.

Ronaldo, for
 his part, had written off Portugal’s prospects, admitting: ‘We were 
never going to win the World Cup with a team as average as this.’ How 
close he came to proving himself wrong.

Ronaldo
 came close to opening the scoring in the fifth minute when no one else 
in this skyscraper stadium sensed a whiff of a chance. From way out on 
the right he floated a cross beyond and behind Fatua Dauda, who could 
only turn and watch the ball rebound from his crossbar.

Six
 minutes later Ghana’s goalkeeper dived to his left to turn aside a 
trademark Ronaldo free-kick. Seven minutes after that the new World 
Footballer of the Year rose for a powerful header which Dauda palmed 
away.

So it was to go on … and on.

Down and out: Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo

Ghana,
 with their nation’s pride to save, were having their moments, too. By a
 poignant irony, a Ghanaian defender scored for Portugal the goal for 
which, after half an hour, Ronaldo was still urgently striving. Miguel 
Veloso crossed on the run from the left and John Boye’s panicky swing 
contrived to provide a finishing touch of which Ronaldo would have been 
proud. The ball looped upwards off his knee at an implausible angle to 
ricochet gently into the net off both bar and post.

On
 the stroke of half-time we were almost bore witness to history. The 
same Ghanaian defender took a similar wild swing, only this time the 
ball sheered just over the bar.

Maybe
 it would be safer to leave this John Boye in Walton’s Mountain. No 
sooner had Thomas Muller put Germany ahead in Recife than the glimmer of
 hope that Portugal might overturn the USA’s goal difference advantage 
evaporated with a Ghana equaliser.

Asamoah Gyan rose to meet Kwadwo Asamoah’s cross with an unstoppable header.

Now
 it was Ghana who had closed within striking distance of the Americans. 
Their athletic pace kept carrying them deep into the Portuguese penalty 
area but the finishing touch eluded them.

That dream finally died at the feet of Ronaldo — who else?

After slamming his shot low into the corner from Dauda’s weak palming down of the ball, Ronaldo spurned celebration.

He just turned away, knowing that his race was run.
