John Carver expects Newcastle United to have named a new head coach by the end of January.

Alan Pardew's former assistant remains in caretaker charge and has told the club's hierarchy he wants the role on a permanent basis.

However, they have already held talks with former Lyon boss Remi Garde and will press ahead with their recruitment plans following Saturday's game with Southampton, after which they have a fortnight break.

And Carver said: 'We are quite a way down the line in the process, and they are doing it properly and thoroughly, which I agree with.
