Captive man: Whitey Bulger, 83, was sentenced to life in prison with up to 30 additional years behind bars

James 'Whitey Bulger' has written an explosive letter from solitary confinement denying any involvement in the death of Debbie Davis and accusing her family of cashing in on her death, it was revealed today.

For the first time, the convict gives his version of events surrounding the brutal 1981 murder of the teen and said the $1million pay out the government awarded to her family was 'A F***ING RIP OFF OF THE TAX PAYERS MONEY!!' - even though the defense for his murder trial cost taxpayers $2.6million.

He blames Davis' boyfriend - his former henchman - Stephen Flemmi  for the woman's slaying, claiming Flemmi carried it out when he found out the teen was secretly dating another member of the mob and had been doing a lot of drugs.

In his recent trial, Bulger was charged with the murder of Davis but the jury served up a 'no finding' verdict.

In his letter, obtained by RadarOnline, he insists:  'I never killed a woman in my life!'

Remembering the day he met her at a Massachusetts jewelry shop, he said: 'Debbie was young, kind of cute, or pretty is a better adjective, with a nice smile.

'Very young, I thought 15 or so, when her and Stevie started going out. But [she changed] into a material girl.

'Soon Debbie is driving a Corvette 
car, hair streaked with blonde, lots of flashy stylish clothes. She was 
very thin, pretty and changed.'

It wasn't long before Flemmi 
discovered his teen girlfriend was on speed and went to coke parties 
behind his back, Whitey wrote in the letter.

Better days: Whitey Bulger wrote in a recent letter from prison that the 16 years he spent on the run with his girlfriend Catherine Greig were the best of his life (pictured together here in an undated photo)

Spotted: Greig and Bulger were captured in 2011 in their then-apartment in Santa Monica, California

When she quit her job at the jewelry 
store, 'Stevie would send Debbie and her mother on vacation to keep her 
busy and happy. Plus constant gifts of expensive clothes, jewels.

'She and her mother went to Acapulco, Mexico, nice place in the winter, first class Hyatt Regency, etc.

'She and her mother were there for two weeks, soon her mother comes home, alone!' the inmate recalls

'No word from Debbie, no phone calls,
Stevie is going nuts!! She comes home with long story. Changed, demands
he marry her, buy land, put up two houses.'

It was when Flemmi bugged her phone that he found out she was seeing someone else.

'The whole Davis family is in on this
and Stevie knows it and slowly goes insane. He winds up killing 
Debbie,' Bulger claims, adding that her whole family knew he was 
innocent from the get go.

In his letter he calls them 'low 
lives' who knew that Debbie was running with a dangerous crowd and accuses them of making a living from her death.

In September 2009, a judge ordered 
Bulger and Flemmi to pay the Davis family $33.5 million in damages after
a wrongful death lawsuit. They later got $1,000,000 from the federal 
government.

'A F***ING RIP OFF OF THE TAX PAYERS 
MONEY!! UNREAL …' Bulger writes.

'I would bet my life … if [the Davis 
family] was offered that Debbie could come back [to life if they] would 
return the money, it would NEVER HAPPEN!!!!'

Wanted: The FBI released these photos of Mr Bulger (left, center) and Ms Greig (right) in an effort to find the two fugivites

Traveling man: Bulger, seen here in an undated photo that was shown at his trial, was on the run from about 1995 to 2011 but now he will spend the rest of his life behind bars

Earlier days: In his latest letter, Bulger said that the years on the run- and not the ones when he was working his way up to be Boston's biggest mob boss- were his favorite

This is the latest of Whitey's prison letters obtained by RadarOnline, since he was 
sentenced to spend life in prison plus up to 30 years after being found 
guilty of 11 murders and a number of other racketeering and extortion counts from his days as the head of
the Winter Hill Gang.

'My 16 years on the run were the happiest years of my life and hers. Memories sustain me,' he wrote in a previous letter.

'If I met Catherine at a younger age I would have had a better life. She was the best thing that ever happened to me.'

Greig began dating Bulger sometime in the 1970s and lived together in Boston before they went on the run in 1995.

After
being caught by authorities by Bulger's side in their adopted apartment
in Santa Monica, California in 2011, she was recently tried and found 
guilty of harboring a fugitive. She is now serving an eight-year prison 
sentence.

Bulger does not appear to be settling for his life sentence, as he writes that he is 'getting things together for appeal'.

'Jail and prisons are a dead end,' he said in the letter.

'I expect the worst is yet to come — I’ll deal with it and welcome the "peace",' the 83-year-old convict wrote.

'Will
be busy but will write you again later on — You could do me a favor. 
Stay out of trouble and avoid entanglement in this. Meet a nice girl and
enjoy life + appreciate freedom.'

It is not clear who the letter was for.
