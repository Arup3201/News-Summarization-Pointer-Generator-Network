Boris Johnson yesterday piled the pressure on David Cameron over Europe by saying the PM’s bid to wrest back powers from Brussels should be ‘easy’.

A day after launching his audacious bid to return to Parliament, the London Mayor appeared to set Mr Cameron up to fail by saying there was little to prevent success in his European negotiations.

Senior Tories fear Mr Johnson is setting a ‘trap’ by demanding a string of unachievable reforms before he would agree to support continued membership of the European Union.

In a wide-ranging interview, the Mayor also hinted at his ambitions to ‘run government’ and insisted he has become more serious since he first became mayor.

Mr Johnson confirmed on Wednesday that he is looking for a Commons seat in what is being seen as a springboard for a future leadership bid. 

Most of the speculation has been around the recently-vacated safe Tory seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in West London.

Friends said last night that Mr Johnson was still mulling his options and that he had around ten days to submit his application.

But it was reported that Tories in Uxbridge were expecting Mr Johnson’s application to arrive within the next 48 hours – perhaps as soon as today. 

Other constituency options for Mr Johnson, who takes two weeks’ holiday from today, include Hertsmere and Kensington and Chelsea.

David Cameron on holiday with his wife on Tuesday: The Prime Minister has promised an in/out referendum on European Union membership in 2017

Mr Cameron has promised an in/out referendum in 2017, after he has brought back powers such as a crackdown on benefit tourism.

But on Wednesday, Mr Johnson demanded even more – including renegotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy, which is highly unlikely to be agreed by other EU leaders. And he suggested that if he does not get the reforms he wants, he will not be happy to support staying in Europe in 2017.

He told the London Evening Standard yesterday: ‘I think you could easily [secure changes by 2017].

‘There is no reason why an intergovernmental conference to settle all those points shouldn’t be done in that space of time.’

Mr Johnson added that the Prime Minister needed to be tough by ‘going in hard and low’ in talks to succeed.

But he denied sabotaging Mr Cameron, saying: ‘I believe what I’m doing is simply amplifying what Dave has said.’ Amid criticism from some Tories about his conduct when he was last an MP, Mr Johnson insisted that he was now a ‘totally different’ person.

When he was last in Westminster, he sparked a row with Jamie Oliver, upset the people of Liverpool and was forced to resign over allegations he had an affair.

But he insisted: ‘I think I understand the business of government pretty well now.’

Mr Johnson, who if successful will spend a year as both mayor and an MP before his City Hall term ends in 2016, also made a number of statements suggesting he had a vision for ruling the entire country.

‘I want a country that is open, optimistic, generous, where people have a sense of opportunity,’ he said.

But yesterday Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the mayor’s ‘bumbliness’ was a front to disguise his ruthless ambition. ‘He treats his political ambition like he treats his hair,’ he told LBC Radio. ‘He wants everyone to think he does not care but actually he really, really does care.’

A number of Tory backbenchers fear Boris Johnson could prove a ‘disruptive influence’ in the run-up to the general election.

Some have questioned his previous performance as a shadow minister, while others warn they are turned off by his liberal views on immigration.

Mark Field, MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, told BBC Radio 4’s World Tonight: ‘I think he has a great track record, but there are some of the old guard who think that he did not make much of an impact last time.’

And Eurosceptics are not happy with his stance on immigration.

Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, said: ‘He does need to take a harder line on immigration. An amnesty is a crackpot policy and you can’t sell it on the doorstep; it would be a disaster.

On whether he would be a good leader, Mr Jackson said: ‘I’m not caught up in Boris mania: he needs to get a seat first, but he’s an asset.’

A poll of grassroots Tory voters for the ConHome website found Mr Johnson had a popularity rating of 83.3 per cent– just above Chancellor George Osborne on 83.

But one senior Tory said: ‘While he is popular generally, it is not clear that there is a lot of support for Boris among many Tory MPs.

‘Many remember his performance as a shadow minister, where some thought he was…not taking the role seriously enough.’
