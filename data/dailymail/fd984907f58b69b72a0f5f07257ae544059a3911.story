Manny Pacquiao is prepared to treat Floyd Mayweather Jnr as the ‘A side’ in an attempt to finalise their £200m mega-fight.

After six years of wrangling, an agreement for a fight between two of the best pound-for-pound boxers in the world has never been closer.

Mayweather visited Pacquiao’s hotel suite in Miami on Tuesday night, hours after they had exchanged phone numbers during a basketball match.

Fight fans will be hoping the exchange leads to the mega-bout the world is waiting for

During an hour-long conversation, both men showed a desire to stage the fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2.

The only outstanding issues raised during the meeting related to the broadcast of the bout. Mayweather is contracted to Showtime while Pacquiao’s fights are shown on HBO.

But Pacquiao’s adviser Michael Konz said those have been resolved and that any announcement about the fight will be made by Mayweather.

‘For the most part, it was just Floyd, Manny and I in the room and it was a very good conversation,’ Koncz told Yahoo. 

‘I think Floyd is sincere about wanting the fight, I really do. I know Manny has wanted it and he’s ready to fight and has been for a while. So I’m very optimistic. I really am.

‘Nobody can stop this. I can’t stop it. [Pacquiao’s promoter] Bob [Arum] can’t stop it. HBO can’t stop it. Showtime can’t. [Mayweather advisor] Al [Haymon] can’t. The only ones who can stop it are Floyd and Manny, and right now, they’re both saying they want the fight.

‘We’re treating him as the A side in this because we just want to get it done and we want to give the fans what they’ve been asking for, for years.’

Mayweather has accepted a 60/40 split of the purse in his favour and could break the news over the Super Bowl weekend.
