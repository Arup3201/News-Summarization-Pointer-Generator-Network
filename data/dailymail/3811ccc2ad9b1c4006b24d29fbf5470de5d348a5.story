Economic woes may have brought misery to homeowners across Britain. But two young ladies have managed to defy the property market downturn.

Tamara and Petra Ecclestone, daughters of Formula 1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone, are expected to make millions from the sale of their sprawling London homes.

Tamara, 28, has put her seven-bedroom Chelsea house up for sale for £19,750,000 – just five years after buying it for £10,750,000.

Recession, what recession? Petra Ecclestone and Tamara Ecclestone plan to cash in on their property portfolio

Yours for £19,750,000: Tamara's seven-bedroom house has a home cinema

Petra's pad: This roof terrace is one of the features of the £32 million Chelsea property

As well as six bathrooms, it features
a swimming pool, home cinema, a gym containing a sunbed, and a walk-in 
wardrobe with a handbag conveyer belt.

She already owns a £45million home in Kensington Palace Gardens – London's 'billionaires' row'.

That 55-room pile includes special wardrobes for her £500,000 handbag collection.

Meanwhile, 24-year-old fashion 
designer Petra has advertised her seven-story Chelsea home for 
£32million. Bought for £20million in 2009, it includes six bedrooms, six
bathrooms and a roof terrace.

In 2010 she paid £53million for a 
123-room Los Angeles mansion. Tamara is also said to have her eye on an 
LA property, worth £78million and modelled on the Palace of Versailles.

Their 82-year-old father has 
previously criticised their spending, but Tamara has said: 'I'm very 
grateful that he's afforded me a nice life, but I am not going to spend 
the rest of my life apologising for it.'

Bump on board: Petra, pictured with a friend, is currently expecting her first child with husband James

Petra's property, which is just shy of 8,000 sq ft, was her and James Stunt's home before they relocated to America.

The property is described in the estate agent's 
brochure as 'stunning' and also has a cinema room, a gym and a luxurious roof terrace, perfect for entertaining in the summer.

And should you want some staff to live in the pile also has a staff flat and a double garage.

A spokesperson for Petra was unavailable for comment earlier today. It is thought Bernie bought the plush pad for his youngest daughter.
