A university job application form has sparked fury in Ireland after it emerged candidates were being asked about their menstrual cycle.

Questions on the form, issued by the National University of Ireland Galway, included ‘do you suffer with menstrual periods?’ and ‘do you suffer any breast problems?’, it has been reported.

The content of the ‘pre-employment health assessment’ has been described as ‘totally outrageous’ while a politician has called for an independent review into equality issues at the college.

According to RTE, female job hunters were asked: ‘Have you ever been treated for gynaecological problems?’ The form also asks whether candidates have had prostate problems in the past.

The university has defended the questions, insisting the answers are ‘completely confidential’ and not seen by human resources.

But RTE quotes Sinn Féin’s Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh as calling the content of the form ‘invasive’ and ‘bordering on misogynistic’.

Calling for an independent review by Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, he added: ‘I think it is a very invasive line of questioning to be asking any future employee. I think some of the questions are totally out of order.

‘As some commentators in the college have said they're bordering on misogynistic in some cases. I can't understand why any third-level institution would be asking any prospective employee questions that are of such an invasive nature and intrude into people's privacy.

‘I can't understand why you'd ask so specific questions of people and I think it is totally outrageous.’

In a statement given to the Connacht Tribune, NUI Galway said: ‘On appointment to a position the university issues an individual with a pre-employment health assessment form, among others, for completion. The form is in line with forms used for employment purposes.

‘The form is completely confidential and returned by the individual to the university Occupational Health Physician directly. The HR office does not have sight of or record of the completed form.

‘A confirmation is simply received of medical fitness for duty or not. The form was introduced a number of years ago by an Occupational Health Physician to replace the medical consultation on appointment.’
