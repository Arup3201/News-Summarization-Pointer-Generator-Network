Despite Real Madrid not planning to enter the January transfer market, Marca say they are being tempted by a £20million offer from Athletic Bilbao for Asier Illarramendi.

Selling the defensive midfielder, who has struggled to cement a place in the side since moving from Real Sociedad in July 2013, would pave the way for Madrid to pursue their interest in Lucas Silva.

The 21-year-old Cruzeiro midfielder has been linked with a host of Premier League sides - including Arsenal - during the last few months, however Silva has revealed he is keen on a move to the Spanish capital.

Speaking previously to Marca, he said: 'I dream of Real Madrid. I'm ready to play there, whether it's now or in June.'
