They say that lightning never strikes twice, but one Michigan man has achieved it in the form of two lottery wins within two years.

Officials say Barrytown man Joseph Palmarchuk, 66, won a $1.35 million lottery jackpot Wednesday in Michigan's Classic Lotto 47 game.

Two years ago, Palmarchuk has also won a $1 million lottery game in Tennessee.

Two in a million: Joe Palmarchuk and his wife Phillis with their latest lottery win

The retiree and his wife Phillis moved to Mecosta County, north of Grand Rapids, in 2011 from Tennessee to be close to family.

Six months later he received a call from Tennessee informing him he had won $1 million in a second-chance lottery draw.

'I moved to be close to family so they could help take care of me,' Palmarchuk said in 2011.

'Now I can help take care of them!'

Palmarchuk has seven children, 23 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

This latest win earned him the jackpot of the Classic Lotto 47.

He says he likes to buy lottery tickets that retailers put aside as mistakes and believes his wins are the result of karma.

Palmarchuk predicts another win in the next year, although not another million.

'I play the lottery numerous times everyday,' Palmarchuk told 9 and 19 News.

'I've learned that it works... You can't win if you don't got a ticket.'

He expects his next win to be a little more modest but he also predicts he will win the Powerball or Mega Millions in the next three years.

The Palmarchuks plan to hunt for a condominium in a warm state to skip Michigan winters.

With their winnings, the Palmarchuks plan to help family, travel in their RV and buy a house somewhere on the Gulf to avoid Michigan winters.

Joe Palmarchuk will continue to play lottery everyday.
