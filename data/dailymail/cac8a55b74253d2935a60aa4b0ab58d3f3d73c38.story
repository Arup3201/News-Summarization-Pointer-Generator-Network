The son of Robert F. Kennedy has been arrested for allegedly attacking two nurses who tried to stop him removing his newborn baby from hospital.

Douglas Kennedy, a journalist, is charged with harassment and endangering the welfare of a child following the altercation, which happened last month.

He is alleged to have twisted the arm of one nurse and kicked another in the crotch as they tried to make sure his two-day-old son Boru was not being treated roughly.

Charges: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with wife Molly and one of their children, was arrested this week

Hospital: Mr Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk

Mr Kennedy strongly refutes the charges, and told NBC New York the claims were 'absurd'.

The accusations date from January 7, when Mr Kennedy, 44, was visiting his wife Molly and their newborn son - the couple's fourth - in Northern Westchester Hospital in New York.

Mr and Mrs Kennedy then started to take the baby for a walk outside, but were stopped by nurses concerned for the boy's safety.

They asked him to return the newborn to the emergency room, but he refused - encouraged by Dr Timothy Haydock, a family friend who works at the hospital.

When Mr Kennedy ignored them and walked in to the elevator, nurses triggered a 'code pink', which alerts staff that someone is trying to abduct a baby.

'Attack': A figure shown falling over in the hospital corridor is said to be a nurse kicked in the crotch by Mr Kennedy

Fall: Mr Kennedy is also said to have twisted the arm of a nurse who tried to block his way

Police said that one nurse, Anna Margaret Lane, stood in Mr Kennedy's way, so he grabbed her wrist and twisted it to move her out of the way.

A police statement continued that the baby's head started to 'move from side to side, and in an attempt to stabilize the baby's head, nurse Cari Maleman Luciano reached toward the infant's head.'

Ms Luciano told authorities: 'Instinctively as a nurse, I raised both my arms toward the neck of the baby to steady the violent shaking of the baby's head and neck.'

But Mr Kennedy then allegedly kicked her in the pelvis and caused her to fall over.

In security footage of the incident, a figure can be seen to fall backwards away from the elevator.

Mr Kennedy then fell on the floor, still holding his son, and jumped up to run downstairs, according to the police report, but was 'stopped by security and escorted back to the infant's room'.

Accused: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with his wife Molly, has been charged with harassment and endangerment of a child following an incident last month

Scene: The altercation happened at the Northern Westchester Hospital in suburban New York on January 7

Family: Mr Kennedy is pictured as a baby with his parents Bobby and Ethel Kennedy, months before the assassination of the former Attorney General and presidential candidate

He was charged with the alleged offences on Thursday.

The Kennedys deny any wrongdoing, and said in a statement: 'The nurse had no right to attempt to grab our child out of his father's arms and I, Douglas, was shocked and appalled when she did so.'

The family's lawyer told the Daily News: 'This is nothing more than a money grab.'

Dr Haydock has supported the couple's story and claimed that 'the nurses were the only aggressors'.

Mr Kennedy is a reporter and occasional presenter for Fox News, having started his career with the New York Post.

He is the tenth son of Bobby Kennedy, the U.S. senator, Attorney General and presidential candidate who was assassinated in 1968, five years after the death of his brother JFK.
