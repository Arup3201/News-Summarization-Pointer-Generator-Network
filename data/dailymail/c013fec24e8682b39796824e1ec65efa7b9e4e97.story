They have watched everything from hippies drinking their own urine to Kerry Katona slurring.

But today the presenters of ITV’s This Morning struggled to articulate some rather hair-raising questions while talking to a man who has sex with cars.

Edward Smith told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden that although he has made love to 700 cars in his lifetime, he has now settled down with the ‘love of his life’ - a Volkswagen Beetle he calls ‘Vanilla’.

Edward Smith, 63, is a mecaphile, meaning he is sexually interested in machines

Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden questioned Mr Smith about his love affairs with cars on ITV's This Morning

Mr Smith lost his virginity to his neighbour's Volkswagen Beetle at age 14, and this awoke a voracious sexual appetite for cars which took him to car parks and car showrooms for threesomes

Mr Smith, 63, is a mecaphile, which means he is sexually interested in cars and believes he is in a relationship with one.

While presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden managed to ask probing questions about the details of his sexual history with four wheeled machines, there were clearly moments when it was difficult for the pair not to crack up.

Mr Smith boasted he has bedded Jaguars, Mustangs, had threesomes in car parks and car showrooms, and has even had brief flings with helicopters and planes.

Mecaphilia is considered a crime in the U.K., with perpetrators put on the sexual offenders register.

As a teenager, Mr Smith began to look at car magazines in the same way some men devour pornography, before finally losing his virginity to his neighbour’s Volkswagen Beetle at age 14.

He said: ‘I got tempted one night to step outside to gently caress the car.

‘It did something for me, woke something up inside of me.’

Once this desire had been awakened,  he began to seek out cars that he was attracted to.

He said: ‘I look back at that thinking that was really risky business. That’s the history, yes, in fact, I cannot deny that there were a number of neighbourhood car lots. I would go over to visit.’

When asked how he makes love to a car, he clarified that he is not attracted to any kind of penetration.

He said: ‘It’s hugging and holding the shape of the car close to me and talking to it a little bit.

‘The rest is just physical satisfaction... hat’s done next to the car.’

He added that he always kept his clothes on.

‘I basically just unzipped. I’ve never got naked on a car – in public’ he said.

Mr Smith did have human girlfriends in secondary school and university, and one who he met as ag grown adult living in San Francisco in 1971, although he was never able to consummate the relationship.

He said: ‘It was not a thoroughly satisfying experience. 

To have sex with a car, he holds the body of the car, strokes and caresses it, and then masturbates

While his libido has calmed as he grows older, he has a 'deep love' for his favourite cars, Vanilla, Cinnamon and Ginger and worries he may crash or they may break down

Mr Smith boasts he has had sex with 700 cars, as well as helicopters and planes, but has now settled down with a white 1969 Volkswagen Beetle called Vanilla who he says is the 'love of his life'

‘I never got so involved like my brothers did and spent the night with them.’

Now, he says his white Volkswagen Vanilla is his girlfriend and the love of his life.

‘She certainly has become special. I got her in 1982 so it will be 30 years on December 23rd' he said. 

The pair ‘met’ when Mr Smith was involved in a relationship with another Volkswagen Beetle called Victoria.

But when he laid eyes on Vanilla, it was love at first sight.

He said: ‘I first met her, before I got her, when I lived here In Yelm, they had the local Jehovah’s witness church driver around in a white Beetle handing out literature. ‘

‘There was something about that white ’74 beetle when they pulled up to hand out their literature, that while they were talking, I couldn’t take my eyes off of her.’

Years later, he saw an advert for a similar white beetle available to buy. When he went to the dealership he was shocked to find it had the same numberplate and was indeed the same car.

He now greets Vanilla every morning. They 'get intimate'  on his own private property, but he is mindful not to be seen in public.

Mr Smith also is involved with a 1973 Opal GT, named Cinnamon, and 1993 Ford Ranger Splash, named Ginger, but Vanilla is ‘very forgiving’ and doesn’t get jealous.

Although he says he understands that cars are not conscious beings, he feels strongly about them and truly believes they are in a long-term relationship. 

He is the only one who is allowed to wash his cars, which is like giving them a bath, he says. He likes to talk to them, play music and 'suds them all up'

‘I realise that “Edward, in your heart and soul you know that these are cars” - but when I hold them in my arms I do feel an energy that comes from each one of them.

‘Lately at my age, the libidinal energies have calmed. Beyond that, there’s a very deep love that I wouldn’t want anything to separate us after 32 years.’

His feeling are so strong he says he would be ‘devastated’ if there were ever to be a mechanical problem or a crash involving Vanilla.

He says his fear means he drives extremely carefully, almost to the point of paranoia.

Once he became livid after a mechanical engineer did a shoddy job and Vanilla broke down during a long road trip.

While he allows mechanics to fix cars, he has a strict rule: he is the only one allowed to wash them.

‘I prefer to do that myself,’ he said.

‘It’s like giving her a bath. I talk to her, play music, suds her all up.’

Professor Craig Jackson, head of psychology at Birmingham City University, told MailOnline: 

Professor Craig Jackson says mechaphilia is not strictly seen as a mental health problem 

Mechaphilia is quite rare and unusual, and not much is known about how the prevalence of mechaphiles within society, other than they do seem to occur everywhere around the globe, and the cause is not specific to specific cultures. 

Although mechaphilia is an extremely unusual and rare behaviour, the sexual attraction to objects and mechanical equipment is not strictly seen as a mental health problem. 

The Diagnostic Statistical Manual (which acts like a physician’s recipe book for diagnosing health conditions) states that mechaphilia is a non-specific paraphilia, with a paraphilia being a type of sexual attraction or predilection that runs alongside 'conventional' sexual behaviours.

Paraphilia are only seen to be viewed as such when the sexual feelings or behaviours become problematic, often leading to depression or anxiety within the individual, or when the behaviour itself (or the attempted avoidance of such behaviour) causes serious problems with day to day functioning.

There are literally dozens of other forms of unusual paraphilia running from A-Z including Apotemnophilia (attraction to amputees) and Zoosadism (an attraction to seeing animals in pain). 

Some of these paraphilia are more psychiatrically concerning than others – especially if they involve the pleasure of witnessing or inflicting pain or suffering in other adults, children or animals, such as Anthropophagy – a pleasure derived from eating human flesh.

In comparison then, mechaphilia (sometimes known specifically as autophilia, when an individual develops either sexual or emotional attachments to vehicles – most commonly cars) seems quite innocuous and harmless – with many mechaphiles explaining that they do not hurt anyone by their behaviours. 

Indeed Edward Smith has spoken quite openly, and at times graphically, about his behaviour, going to great lengths to point out that he has had relationships with humans before and that he is not homosexual, but that he just prefers cars.

Ever since Fritz Lang’s Metropolis was released in 1927, some have been concerned that the sexualisation of robots – maschinenmensch as it was in the movie – could result in mecaphilia becoming a commonplace occurrence.  

Some mechaphiles may find only vehicles arousing, while some may find both humans and vehicles stimulating and can try to combine both of them into their sexual activities.

What does seem quite common in many mechanophiles, of which approximately 8590% are male, seems to be an extreme form of relationship avoidance and failed romances in early formative years. 

But that is also true for the 'normal' non-mechanaphile population too. While such romantic failures are part of many peoples’ growing up experiences, some find it just too painful and develop alternative feelings and emotions for other objects (even animals) that cannot hurt or reject in the way that humans possibly can. 

Although some mechaphiles do possess the insight to say that they found 'human relationships' too difficult or painful, just as many are often in denial about such difficulties in their pasts.

Mechaphilia, like most other paraphilia, can best be viewed as the result of a disturbance in the psychosexual development, whereby healthy sexual and emotional feelings are subconsciously transferred to objects that are safer or less 'emotionally risky' than other people. 

If this occurs at a crucial time on the formative developmental period, the reward the mechaphile gets (sexual / emotional release without fear of rejection) can be quite powerful and addictive, which will reinforce future mecaphilic behaviours.
