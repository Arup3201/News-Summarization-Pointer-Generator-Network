A 16-year-old Virginia girl is facing a charge of distributing child pornography after tweeting nude pictures of herself.

The James City County girl posted the pictures on or around January 30, and they were shared by various friends before a school resource officer was informed about them.

The school staff member spoke to the girl and her mother before turning the case over to James City County police.

Police charged the girl with one felony count of possession, reproduction, distribution, solicitation, and facilitation of child pornography.

According to the WAVY, police decided to pursue the harsh charge due to the 'lewdness' of the photos.

The teen may face jail time for the nude photographs, but it's more likely she and her parents will have to complete a court-ordered 'Sexting Education' program.

Officer Stephanie Williams-Ortery said teenagers often don't understand the seriousness of sharing personal information and photographs online.

'It’s not just friends that see what they post but also strangers and everyone else out there,' Williams-Ortery told WAVY.

'You have no idea who’s out there watching. You never know who’s going to see what you post.'

This isn't the first time the mix of sex and social media has had disastrous results for a teen.

Last month, a Canadian teen was convicted of child pornography possession after posting a nude photo of her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend on Facebook.

The girl's lawyer slammed the decision after her guilty verdict.

‘These child pornography laws were intended to protect children, not to persecute them, and again it seems the criminal justice system, it's a heavy hammer to be using,’ said Christopher Mackie.

Williams-Ortery says the Virginia girl isn't the only one who may be in trouble with the law over the pictures.

'I would hope that they would not then forward it on to their friends because then they become guilty also of distribution of child pornography, whether they know that or not,' she told WAVY.
