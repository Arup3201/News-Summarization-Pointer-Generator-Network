Bail: IT Paul Anthony Lovell at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court today

An man accused of trying to have sex with a sheep next to Tottenham Hotspur’s new training ground appeared in court today.

Paul Lovell, 61, allegedly exposed his genitals when he was caught with the animal close to the state-of-the-art facility on Hotspur Way, Enfield, north London, on September 4.

It is thought stars from the Premiership team were training at the centre on the day of the incident.

Lovell, an IT worker, has denied two charges, one of indecent exposure and another of outraging public decency, and has opted to be tried by a jury.

He was released on bail today by Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court.

His bail is on condition that he does not return to Whitewebbs Lane or Archers Wood in Enfield, where it is claimed he was found 'behaving in an indecent manner'.

The first charge alleges that Lovell, of Enfield, Middlesex, intentionally exposed his genitals 'intending that someone would see them and be caused alarm or distress contrary to section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003'.

The second claims he committed an act of outraging public decency, ‘namely trying to commit a sexual act with a sheep and trying to encourage a sheep to perform a sexual act on you’, which is contrary to common law.

Lovell will now face a plea and case management hearing at Wood Green Crown Court on 2 October.

Decency: Lovell is accused of trying to perform a sexual act with a sheep (file photo), which is prohibited in common law
