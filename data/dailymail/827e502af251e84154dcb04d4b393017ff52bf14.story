This wall of foam sparked widespread panic among locals as it rushed along a river in southern China.

The mass of soapy suds blanketed the water in Xintang, in China's Guangdong province, leading to evacuations along the banks of the river.

But officials have now said the only threat posed by the foam - thought to have been caused by chemicals washed into the river - was the possibility of 'one or two dead fish' lurking in the bubbles.

'Panic': A local man is dwarfed by the mass of suds floating down a river in southern China

The bizarre scene is thought to
 have been caused after heavy rainfall washed a non-toxic chemical 
deodorant from a household rubbish tip into the river.

The bubbles were created when the chemical was swept over a waterfall, officials said.

A
 spokesman said: 'People are right to be cautious but it is harmless. It
 made very large bubbles when it went over a waterfall, but apart from 
one or two dead fish, it is harmless.'
