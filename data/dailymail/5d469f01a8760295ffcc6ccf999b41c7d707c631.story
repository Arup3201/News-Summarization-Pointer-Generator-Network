An abandoned village in Connecticut, the unfulfilled vision of an 'eccentric' aerospace engineering executive, is up for auction the week of Halloween.

The old twine mill town of Johnsonville, in East Haddam, hasn't allowed visitors in decades. 

It may again, as the 62 acres of land and assorted abandoned Victorian buildings are for sale, with bidding starting at $800,000.

Keep out: An abandoned village in Connecticut, the unfulfilled vision of an 'eccentric' aerospace engineering executive, is up for auction the week of Halloween. The buildings haven't been used since Raymond Schmitt died in 1998 and have closed to curious guests 

Jim Kelly of brokerage firm RM Bradley says he planned the auction to fall around Halloween to play up the more mysterious aspects of the town, as ghost stories abound and the property has an ethereal feel.

Johnsonville began in the 19th century as a mill town built around an active twine mill operation on the Moodus River.

In 1972, Raymond Schmitt, who Kelly describes as a 'very eccentric' owner of aerospace part corporation AGC Incorporated, bought the property after a lightning strike destroyed the mill. 

Chapel: Schmitt worked to find buildings, like this old chapel, to fill a 19th century tourist destination that sadly never boomed

Decay: After Schmitt's death in 1998, most of the buildings fell into disrepair, though the property changed hands and was set for development at several times

Schmitt decided to create a Victorian-era tourist attraction and traveled around the northeast buying up entire buildings and shipping them to Johnsonville.

A post office, schoolhouse, chapel, general store and the original homestead of the mill owners give Johnsonville the air of a vibrant yet abandoned town. 

Schmitt even purchased a paddleboat from the World's Fair in the 1960s and brought it to Johnsonville, where he hoped to use it to ferry passengers around the lake in the middle of the property.

But although Schmitt allowed visitors onto the grounds, and weddings were occasionally held at the Swiss chalet-styled restaurant the town never truly became a bustling hub for tourists and Schmitt died in 1998.

Even the paddleboat began sinking into the lake. 

Homestead: Large home tracts are laid out throughout the village, which never became the destination Schmitt was quite hoping it would

Flashback: The show Abandoned shot an episode about Johnsonville, which was a quiet tourist destination starting in the 1970s, but was later abandoned

Origins: Johnsonville was originally the home of a twine mill, and pictured here in this photo posted to the town's Facebook is the original Neptune mill, which was struct by lightning in 1972 and burned

No Trespassing signs hang now warning off curious travelers, and Damned Connecticut calls the grounds 'a weird dead spot' in an otherwise populated town. 

The auction takes place October 28 and Kelly says visitors have viewed the auction page more than 700 times. 

As for bidding, Kelly says he doesn't know how high the final price will be, but that the 62 acres stand to sell for a high price.

'$800,000 just gets you in the game,' he added. 

Tranquility: In spite of never becoming a vacationer's paradise, some report going fishing at the pond and even having their wedding on the Johnsonville before it was closed

Vintage: The old General Store gives the village a timeless feel that may or may not be preserved by the new owners
