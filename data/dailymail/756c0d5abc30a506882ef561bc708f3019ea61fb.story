Sunday will give us an opportunity to take a look at Alexis Sanchez and Raheem Sterling when Arsenal play Liverpool at Anfield.

Sanchez has clearly become one of the stars of the Premier League in the five months he has been here and with Theo Walcott on the verge of returning, Arsene Wenger will soon be able to field a front three of Walcott, Sanchez and Danny Welbeck. 

That is a forward line with as much pace and which will inspire almost as much fear as Liverpool’s front three from last season: Luis Suarez, Daniel Sturridge and Sterling.

What I love about Sanchez is his hunger. Hard work isn’t a dirty word for him; he puts in a shift. He shares that attribute with Suarez and Carlos Tevez. It is as though the South American players, who have come from relatively tough backgrounds, are grateful for opportunities they have and haven’t forgotten the hard work it took to get them to where they are.

But Sanchez’s best quality is his calmness in the penalty area to finish chances off — and if Sterling can learn from that, he can become a truly great player.

The Liverpool flyer is still young — he was 20 earlier this month — but there are similarities with Sanchez in that he can get into the same positions, whether he plays down the middle or down the side.

The next step for him is to become a finisher — do that and in two or three years’ time he could end up at Barcelona or Real Madrid. He’s not ready for that now, but he could be.

Suarez managed to work on his finishing during his time at Liverpool and Walcott has improved over the past few years, so it can be done.

Sterling gets in there time and time again, which is evidence enough of his quality.

When he becomes a clinical finisher, he will be a frightening prospect.
