Snooker legend Stephen Hendry claims that too many players are treating tournaments ‘like stag weekends’ to ever do themselves justice.

The seven-time world champion retired two years ago — though he has hinted that there may be a comeback, and some more competitive play left in the tank.

But the 45-year-old Scot has his ear close to the ground through former peers still on tour and in his capacity as a BBC analyst for the major events.

Stephen Hendry has claimed that too many players are treating tournaments ‘like stag weekends’

Hendry, who enjoyed a long and fierce rivalry with Ronnie O’Sullivan, insists players like the Rocket and Stuart Bingham back up their ability with hours of dedication and toil.

Hendry made huge sacrifices to be the best, leaving no stone unturned to become a better player, and he respects O’Sullivan’s move to seek a breakthrough with Dr Steve Peters three years ago.

He said: ‘To other players out there frustrated with their form or careers, I would say look at Ronnie compared to where he was a few years ago — or Stuart Bingham.

‘Stuart has worked very closely with his coach Steve Feeney, and sometimes you just need one thing to trigger it for you or kick-start things. Just something, anything, whatever it is that does it for you as a player or gives you some extra belief.

‘And when you consider the likes of Stephen Maguire perhaps they just need that something, whether it is talking to someone, anything that can give him an extra edge.

‘Perhaps in Stephen’s case he is more the man’s man type and dealing with sports psychologists and sports psychiatrists or whatever might be seen as wimping out, he tries to do it all himself.

Hendry said he was impressed that Ronnie O'Sullivan had sought the help of Dr Steve Peters

‘But if it is good enough for some of the other top sports people in the world, and we can all name them in other sports, then it must be good enough for him. But some of these players need to look at what they are doing. I am not on tour any more but I hear things, and there are stories that some players are not as dedicated as they should be, and treating some of these PTC events in Europe as stag weekends rather than tournaments. Every player has to look at himself and what he is doing.’

O’Sullivan was drawn against Ricky Walden for the first round of his Masters defence next month, representing an awkward tie against the recent International Championship winner in China.

The match of the first round at Alexandra Palace in north London looks to be world champion Mark Selby against Shaun Murphy, who has specifically targeted the prestigious invitation event title this season.

O’Sullivan was awkwardly caught short without enough underwear before last night’s Coral UK Championship final.

Hendry also praised Stuart Bingham and said younger players could learn from his attitude

The 39-year-old has endured a challenging week in York after breaking his ankle while running in Epping Forest days before the event.

After hobbling through his first match, a distracted O’Sullivan did his best to ease the pain as he slipped through the draw, going on to make a 147 in the last 16 against Matthew Selt.

But hours before the live BBC showdown against Judd Trump, O’Sullivan had to rush in to a city packed with Christmas shoppers on a mission to find some pants.

‘I only brought about five pairs, because with my ankle the way it was at the start I couldn’t see myself going that far in the tournament,’ admitted a sheepish O’Sullivan.

‘So I have got to go into town, over to Marks and Spencers or somewhere, to get myself some new ones for the final.’

An in-form O’Sullivan raced into a 5-1 first-session lead in the best-of-19 frame UK final, an event he has won four times.

But Trump kept the match alive by reducing the arrears to 5-3 before the evening session.
