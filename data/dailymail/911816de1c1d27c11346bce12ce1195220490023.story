It is quite extraordinary that Alastair Cook’s position as England captain should even be a subject for debate, let alone his dismissal a serious option at the end of this admittedly tortuous Ashes. It is time to end this nonsense now.

How any serious cricketing judge can believe that England would be better served by jettisoning the captain now, however badly his team have fared here, is beyond me. This is not football.

This is no time to throw out the man who now has the chance to build his own England team, not lead Andrew Strauss’s.

Right man for the job: Andy Flower is also adamant that Cook should remain England captain

Skipper: Captain Alastair Cook walks alone during day four at Melbourne, but has defended the current management structure within the camp

It has surely not been forgotten that this is Cook’s first defeat in six Test series as captain. There were no cries to get rid of him when England were creating history by coming from one down to earn an historic Test series win in India.

And there were no complaints, other than from the tiresome Shane Warne, when Cook was leading England to a 3-0 Ashes victory last summer, a win that would have been greater but for ridiculous bad light regulations at the Oval.  

It is Cook’s misfortune to have come up against probably the two best, most pro-active captains in the world game at the moment in Brendon McCullum and Michael Clarke in his last four series.

The England captain has suffered in the field, but not off it, by comparison with the New Zealand and Australian leaders but he has still only lost one of those four series.

Pecking order: Stuart Broad is England's current Twenty20 captain and could replace Cook

I am not saying that Cook is a tactical genius. Far from it. His game-plan has looked defensive and unimaginative for much of this Ashes but that has mainly been because his team have been struggling so much.

When England have been on top under Cook and his bowlers have been dictating terms then his apparent tactical inadequacies have been less pronounced. A captain, at the end of the day, can only ever be as good as his bowlers to a huge extent.

The biggest reason to defend Cook the England captain is that he is having to learn arguably the toughest job in any sport at the highest level in front of the prying eyes of many a former international captain.

England players are identified so young these days and invariably plucked out of the domestic system so early that they never have a chance to gain the county captaincy experience that many of the best England leaders have had before the ultimate elevation.

Cook will never be one for an eye-catching, ‘look at me’ fielding place or bowling change. He is an under-stated character but a cricketer and man of substance who is destined to break every England batting record in the book and will always seek to lead by example rather than any ‘funky on-field tactics.

Thrashing: England's latest loss at the MCG put them 4-0 behind and on course to be whitewashed

Dejection: Cook leads England off the field after their eight-wicket defeat in the fourth Ashes Test

The most important thing is that he does so much of his good work away from the spotlight, in the many off-field ways that a cricket captain must lead. The dressing room are totally with him, including Kevin Pietersen, who Cook bravely and rightly brought back into the England fold last summer.

And, although it is perhaps a negative reason for advocating the status quo, who on earth could conceivably replace Cook as captain now, just when the need is greatest for his steady hand on the tiller and his runs at the top of the order?

My colleague Mike Dickson, a cricket correspondent for nine years and a man who knows his subject having covered England under captains of real substance like Nasser Hussain and Michael Vaughan, advocates Stuart Broad and, yes, he has one of the best brains in the England cricket team.

But the fact that England have quietly preferred Matt Prior and then, when he was dropped in Melbourne, Ian Bell rather than Broad as Test vice-captain says it all. A fast bowler with a history of leaving tours early through injury who plays in all forms of the game cannot feasibly be the captain of England.

Carry on: Cook still needs the chance ton build his own side, not continue with Andrew Strauss's

Looking up: Alastair Cook's position as England captain is under threat after a disastrous Ashes tour

Elsewhere the captaincy cupboard is bare.
Pietersen has the experience and know-how to have a second crack at the
job but the wounds from his serious brushes with authority run too deep
for it ever to be a viable proposition.

England even preferred James Tredwell to Pietersen when they needed an emergency captain for a Twenty20 international last year.

Ian Bell is another senior professional but nothing in his game and demeanour suggests he is a leader of men while the same reservations that apply to Broad would rule out Jimmy Anderson as a serious candidate even though he does not play Twenty20 cricket for England.

England very much hope Joe Root will be Cook’s eventual successor but clearly the time for that is not now, particularly as he would be in the same captaincy boat as Cook in having had little chance to gain leadership experience before graduating to Test level. Leave Root alone to get back in the runs.

So Cook it is but I admit, as Hussain has so eloquently pointed out in these pages, that he has to improve. He tried to fight the same battle here as Strauss did in winning three years ago but now is the time for change.

To the future: Andy Flower wants to stay on as England coach despite the Ashes debacle

For a start Cook must make it absolutely clear who is in charge. This is his England now. Not Strauss’s. Not even really Andy Flower’s. As Duncan Fletcher, another great coach of England, would say – the coach is a consultant. It is the captain who is in charge of a cricket team.

Do not let Broad and Anderson so clearly set their own fields, Alastair. Show them who is boss on the field as well as off it. Throw off the shackles of conservatism. Take control.

There will still be times when he gets it wrong, like on the fateful third morning of the fourth Test when he seemed clueless against Brad Haddin, but those periods of play will become lesser the more he does the job.

Cook has only been in full charge for a year, for heaven’s sake, and at 29 he should be in his prime as a player. Give him a bit more time and he will learn, as others like Hussain, Vaughan and Strauss did, with experience.

Cook has risen to every other challenge set before him in his cricketing career and he will succeed in this one too. England will give him every chance to because they believe in him.
