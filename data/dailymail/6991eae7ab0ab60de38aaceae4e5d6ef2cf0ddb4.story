McDonald's has an idea for speeding up service at the drive-thru: add another window.

Under the current set up, customers place their orders, then drive up to a window where they pick up their food.

The fast-food chain says it's testing a 'Fast Forward Drive-Thru' that lets customers drive to a third stop if their orders aren't ready.

Third window: The change comes as wait times at McDonald's drive-thrus are estimated to be the longest in at least 15 years.

Fast food? McDonald's is planning to add a third window to its drive-thru lanes in response to mounting customer complaints about slow service

McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa McComb says the Fast Forward Drive-Thru will be featured in new and renovated restaurants starting next year.

The drive-thru is an important revenue generator for fast-food chains. McDonald's gets about 70 percent of its sales from the drive-thru, according Richard Adams, who now runs a consulting firm for franchisees.

2014: McD's will begin restructuring the drive-thrus next year. Analysts say drive-thru waits have been getting longer because new menu offerings like Pumpkin Spice Lattes are distracting employees from the core product

The fast food giant will begin restructuring the drive-thrus next year.

'It enables customers to pull forward to receive orders at a third window when their order is not yet ready,' McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa McComb told Bloomberg, adding. that it 'will enable us to better serve more customers quickly.'

Analysts say drive-thru waits have been getting longer because new menu offerings like Pumpkin Spice Lattes and Chocolate Chip Frappes are distracting employees from the brand's core product.

A more complicated menu has bogged down McDonaldâ€™s service. Customers can choose from nine different sauces, such as spicy buffalo and creamy ranch, to go with Mighty Wings.

'The more items you have on the menu, the more challenging it is to get everything served on time and at the right temperature,' said Sara Senatore, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.

Big chain: McDonald's has more than 14,000 locations in the U.S.
