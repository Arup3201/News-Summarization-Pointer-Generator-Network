It is a far cry from the bulky, balloon-like spacesuits worn by today's astronauts.

In the future, we may simply don a suit that automatically shrinks itself to become a 'second skin' to protect us from space.

The skintight, pressurized suit would not only support the astronaut, but would give her much more freedom to move during planetary exploration.

The spacesuit of the future? The MIT 'second skin' suit is made from a smart material that contracts to hug the skin, yet creates a safe, pressurized suit would not only support the astronaut, but would give her much more freedom to move during planetary exploration.

For future astronauts, the process of suiting up is set to be much simpler.

Instead of climbing into a conventional, bulky, gas-pressurized suit, an astronaut may don a lightweight, stretchy garment, lined with tiny, muscle-like coils (below).

They would then plug in to a spacecraft's power supply, triggering the coils to contract and essentially shrink-wrap the garment around the body.

For future astronauts, the process of suiting up may go something like this: Instead of climbing into a conventional, bulky, gas-pressurized suit, an astronaut may don a lightweight, stretchy garment, lined with tiny, musclelike coils. 

They would then plug in to a spacecraft's power supply, triggering the coils to contract and essentially shrink-wrap the garment around her body.

The skintight, pressurized suit would not only support the astronaut, but would give her much more freedom to move during planetary exploration. 

To take the suit off, astronauts would only have to apply modest force, returning the suit to its looser form.

Now MIT researchers are one step closer to engineering such an active, 'second-skin' spacesuit.

Dava Newman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and engineering systems at MIT, and her colleagues have engineered active compression garments that incorporate small, springlike coils that contract in response to heat. 

The coils are made from a shape-memory alloy (SMA) — a type of material that 'remembers' an engineered shape and, when bent or deformed, can spring back to this shape when heated.

The smart suit in action: An original active tourniquet design, combining shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators with 3-D printed structures (the cream-colored plastic) and passive fabric (the white strip).

The team incorporated the coils in a tourniquet-like cuff, and applied a current to generate heat. At a certain trigger temperature, the coils contract to their 'remembered' form, such as a fully coiled spring, tightening the cuff in the process. 

In subsequent tests, the group found that the pressure produced by the coils equaled that required to fully support an astronaut in space.

'With conventional spacesuits, you're essentially in a balloon of gas that's providing you with the necessary one-third of an atmosphere [of pressure,] to keep you alive in the vacuum of space,' says Newman, who has worked for the past decade to design a form-fitting, flexible spacesuit of the future. 

'We want to achieve that same pressurization, but through mechanical counterpressure — applying the pressure directly to the skin, thus avoiding the gas pressure altogether. 

'We combine passive elastics with active materials. … Ultimately, the big advantage is mobility, and a very lightweight suit for planetary exploration.'

Current spacesuits are extremely bulky and difficult to put on and move in

The coil design was conceived by Bradley Holschuh, a postdoc in Newman's lab.

The researchers rigged an array of coils to an elastic cuff, attaching each coil to a small thread linked to the cuff. 

They then attached leads to the coils' opposite ends and applied a voltage, generating heat.

Between 60 and 160 C, the coils contracted, pulling the attached threads, and tightening the cuff.

'These are basically self-closing buckles,' Holschuh says. 

'Once you put the suit on, you can run a current through all these little features, and the suit will shrink-wrap you, and pull closed.'

The group's designs and active materials may be used for other purposes, such as in athletic wear or military uniforms.

'You could use this as a tourniquet system if someone is bleeding out on the battlefield,' Holschuh says. 

'If your suit happens to have sensors, it could tourniquet you in the event of injury without you even having to think about it.'

'An integrated suit is exciting to think about to enhance human performance,' Newman adds. 'We're trying to keep our astronauts alive, safe, and mobile, but these designs are not just for use in space.'
