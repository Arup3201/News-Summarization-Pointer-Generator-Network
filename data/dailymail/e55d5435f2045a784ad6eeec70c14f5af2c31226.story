Cases of scurvy and other illnesses caused by poor standards of living have been piling pressure on already-overburdened A&E wards, Labour has claimed.

The party’s health spokesman, Andy Burnham, told the Commons that the ‘economic climate’ under the Coalition had led to a sharp rise in conditions including scurvy, rickets, malnutrition and hypothermia – putting greater strain on the NHS.

Mr Burnham also insisted too many older people are in hospital who should not be there, adding they were trapped and unable to get the right support to go home.

But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt contested Labour’s claims that illnesses such as scurvy were driving congestion in A&E.

He told the Commons that figures show eight people were admitted to hospital - not just A&E - for scurvy in 2011/12 and 18 people in 2012/13.

Mr Hunt also dismissed claims there had been a winter crisis in A&E - and claimed the Government’s record was actually better than the Opposition’s had been.

Introducing the opposition day debate on the NHS, former health secretary Mr Burnham said attendances to A&E increased by a ‘staggering’ 633,000 between 2010 and 2013 under the coalition and questioned what is happening.

He told the Commons: ‘It is all too easy to reach for simplistic answers to this picture. In truth, it is complex and a range of factors have contributed to this rise. But it’s possible to point to two underlying causes.

'Speak to A&E staff and they will tell you that there has been a rise in people arriving at A&E who have a range of problems linked to their living circumstances'

‘One of those is clearly the general economic climate. People have been living under greater pressure and struggling with the cost of living. A&E has become the last resort for people who are not able to cope for a whole range of reasons.

‘Speak to A&E staff and they will tell you that there has been a rise in people arriving at A&E who have a range of problems linked to their living circumstances.

‘From people with severe dental pain because they can’t afford to pay to see the dentist, to people suffering a breakdown or in crisis, to people who can’t afford to keep warm and are suffering a range of cold-related conditions.’
