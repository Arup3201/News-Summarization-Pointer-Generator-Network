The parents of Oscar winner Marisa Tomei have filed a lawsuit against the son of famed musician John Lennon.

Gary and Addie Tomei are suing Sean Lennon claiming in the six years since he purchased the property next to them, both located on West 13th Street in New York City's Greenwich Village, he has refused to cut down a tree in his front yard whose roots are now destroying the Tomei home, this despite numerous requests from the couple.

As for damages, the couple are asking for $10million - and that the tree be removed.

The Tomeis say they tried for a year to get in touch with Lennon (above) to no avial

The tree, see above in the middle of the Tomei home on the left and Lennon's home on the right, is a 60-foot-high ailanthus tree

According to court documents obtained by the New York Daily News, the Tomeis are claiming the 60-foot-high ailanthus tree which grows in Lennon's front yard has  'compromised the basement wall and interior ... (causing) irreparable damage to the structural integrity of the building.'

That's not all either, with the couple saying their concrete foundation and front stoop have also been compromised, all 14 doors in the two-family home are unable to close because of the damage to the foundation and the facade of the home could become damaged next if the tree does not go soon.

As for the reason behind the lawsuit, the Tomeis claim they have been trying to get in touch with Lennon for a year to no avail.

Lennon, who bought the townhouse in 2008 for $9.5 million and has focused on remodeling the ritzy residence since then, has yet to respond to this lawsuit, though his lawyer, Jonas Herbsman, did admit he was shocked when told just how much the Tomeis are looking for in damages. 

'He refuses to do anything. He’s owned it for six years and neglected it. I like him personally but he’s stubborn and he has a lawyer who is very belligerent,' explained Mr. Tomei.

Even Ms. Tomei, who says she is pro-tree, wants the tree gone.

'I hate to see this tree come down, but it’s destroying my stoop,' said the actress.

'There are cracks everywhere. The masons don’t want to make repairs because they say it’s just going to happen again,' added Mr. Tomei. 

'I want him to take the tree down and pay my expenses. It’s not cheap. I tried but you can’t talk to him. He’s always traveling.'

The couple's daughter Marisa (above) admits that while she hates to see a tree cut down, it is destroying her parents' brownstone

As for the tree, it is an invasive species that was introduced to the United States through China,  nicknamed by some as the Tree of Heaven.

It is also known the for the sour odor it produces when cut, grows new roots constantly and moves those roots around to steal from the supply of other plants - or even crack the walls of a basement.

The New York Post revealed that even Lennon's own arborist and mason were aware of the problems the tree, which is also hollow and rotting, was causing, and urged him to chop it down.

This is not the first time Lennon's home has wrecked havoc on the Tomeis, with a pipe burst happening early last year that forced the duo to move in with their daughter.

The Tomeis, who purchased the home in 1994, also rent out a duplex in the brownstone for $9,000 a month.
