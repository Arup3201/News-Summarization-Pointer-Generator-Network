President Barack Obama's party, having been pushed aside in the last election, will slide into the minority in the Senate next week when Congress reconvenes, giving Republicans full control of the legislative branch. 

But Obama still has a powerful weapon in his arsenal - the presidential veto - and in an interview with NPR that aired this morning he warned Republicans he will use it if they come after his trademark legislation.

'I haven't used the veto pen very often since I've been in office, partly because legislation that I objected to was typically blocked in the Senate even after...Republicans took over the House,' he said. 'Now I suspect there are going to be some times where I've got to pull that pen out. 

'And I'm going to defend gains that we've made in health care; I'm going to defend gains that we've made on environment and clean air and clean water,' Obama added.

'I haven't used the veto pen very often since I've been in office,' President Barack Obama told NPR's Steve Inskeep in an interview that aired this morning. 'Now I suspect there are going to be some times where I've got to pull that pen out,' he added. Obama sat for the interview with NPR before leaving for his annual, Hawaiian vacation, which he is still on

Obama again said he'd rather work with Republicans than against them, however, and he's 'hopeful' that GOP leaders John Boehner, House speaker, and Mitch McConnell, the incoming Senate majority leader, will take the same approach.

'I want to get things done. I don't have another election to run,' he said, moments before vowing to be 'as aggressive as I can be in getting legislation passed that I think help move the economy forward and help middle-class families.'

But the president may have already 'poisoned the well' for bipartisan action in some areas, according to Republicans.

After the GOP wiped enough Democrats off the map in the midterm elections to gain a majority of seats in the Senate, Obama took executive action to enforce his favored immigration reforms in a move that Republicans have attacked as unconstitutional.

In memorandums distributed to the Department of Homeland Security last month Obama ordered the agency to stop deporting illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children before 2010, as well the parents of legal U.S. residents. 

The directives are expected to effectively protect as many as 5 million immigrants illegally residing in the country from removal until a new president takes office in two years and decides to extend authorization allowing them stay or send them back to their native countries.

Republicans on Capitol Hill begged Obama to leave the policy making to Congress and cautioned him that by taking matters into his own hands he would destroy any chance of a working relationship with their party.

Obama acted anyway, and next week he'll get to see if he called their bluff or stirred the pot.

The president told NPR that just because he and Republicans 'disagree on one thing [that] shouldn't prohibit us from getting progress on the areas where there's some overlap.'

'Now you've got Republicans in a position where it's not enough for them simply to grind the wheels of Congress to a halt and then blame me,' he said.

'They are going to be in a position in which they have to show that they can responsibly govern, given that they have significant majorities in both chambers.'

In a statement responding to Obama's interview with NPR, McConnell put the onus on the president to determine how much Republican-passed legislation actually becomes law.

'Bipartisan jobs bills will see the light of day and will make it to the President's desk, and he'll have to make decisions about ideology versus creating jobs for the middle class,' McConnell told the Associated Press. 

'There's a lot we can get done together if the president puts his famous pen to use signing bills rather than vetoing legislation his liberal allies don't like.'

You've been warned: Obama said at his year-end presser earlier this month that Republicans on Capitol Hill will 'meet stiff resistance' from him if they try to repeal Obamacare and his other trademark legislation

Since November's elections Obama has been waving his veto pen in the face of Republicans, lest they follow through on their promise to use their newly established power to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

'On health care, there are certainly some lines I’m going to draw. Repeal of the law I won’t sign,' Obama told reporters a day after his party's downfall in the midterms.

'Efforts that would take away health care from the 10 million people who now have it and the millions more who are eligible to get it we're not going to support.'

Continuing, he said, 'In some cases there may be recommendations that Republicans have for changes that would undermine the structure of the law, and I’ll be very honest with them about that and say, look, the law doesn't work if you pull out that piece or that piece.'

The president indicated that he would be 'very open and receptive' to 'responsible' changes to the health care reform law that improve on it, though, and 'make it work better.'

'There’s no law that's ever been passed that is perfect,' he said, and 'there are some other areas where we think we can do even better.

'But what I will remind them is that despite all the contention, we now know that the law works.'

Obama again threatened Republicans with presidential vetos at his year-end presser ahead earlier this month just before he jetted off with his family for a vacation in Hawaii.

'If Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me,' he assured reporters. 'If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no.

'And I’m confident that I’ll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions,' he said.

It would take a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress to overcome a presidential veto. 

With just 54 members of the Senate in their column, the GOP would need to convince a dozen Democrats to join them in defying the president in order to overwrite his check on their powers.

And despite winning their largest majority in the House since WWII, Republicans have nowhere near enough seats in the House to challenge a presidential veto. Roughly four dozen Democrats would have to append their names to GOP-backed legislation in order to reach the requisite number of yea votes, a very unlikely scenario.

It takes a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress to overwrite a veto; Republicans don't have a large enough majority to do it alone
