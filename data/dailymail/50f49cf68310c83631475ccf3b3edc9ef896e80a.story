Ford Motor Company said Wednesday there is absolutely no way they’ll allow embattled crack smoking mayor Rob Ford’s allies use their famous car logo.

Just a week after finally admitting he smoked crack and one day before announcing he’s purchased illegal drugs, Mayor Ford was photographed signing his loyal fans’ t-shirts emblazoned with the logo.

While self-described denizens of ‘Ford Nation’ cling to their support for the mayor, the carmaker made it clear yesterday that they in no way support Ford. And not just because he drives a GM.

Anything for the fans: Toronto's crack smoking mayor Rob Ford was photographed signing shirts brought by his fans to a charity event Tuesday that featured the carmaker's logo in place of his last name

'We view it as an unauthorized use of our trademark': On Wednesday, Ford spokespeople quickly denied any associations with those making the shirts and said they'd made moves to stop the use of their logo

‘We view it as an unauthorized use of our trademark and have asked it to be stopped,’ spokesman for the carmaker, Jay Cooney, told Bloomberg.

The scandal of the crack-smoking mayor broke six months ago, when the Toronto Star newspaper and media blog Gawker said they had been shown a video of the mayor smoking crack, an allegation that Ford spent six months denying.

Then, last week, he announced he had in fact smoked the crack during one of his ‘drunken stupors.’

Nonetheless, supporters lined up at a United Way charity event on Tuesday to get the mayor’s signature on bobble-head dolls of himself that Ford had made for the cause. And some brought with them the ‘Ford Nation’ shirts that featured the auto company’s recognizable logo.

‘Ford did not grant permission for use of its logo,’ Cooney emphasized.

Meanwhile, the Mayor doesn’t even drive a Ford, he drives a GM.

And that Cadillac Escalade even played a part in the mayor’s long list of scandals after he was snapped reading a document while at the wheel of the Cadillac Escalade.

Ford tough: Despite admissions of drugs use and purchases, video of erratic drunken behavior, and alleged ties to organized crime, Ford continues to cling to office and even retains loyal supporters who believe Ford has helped them

Escalading: The mayor doesn't own a Ford, but this Cadillac Escalade which he was photographed driving while distracted by a handful of documents

In addition to his admitted crack use and dangerous driving, Ford has been accused of having organized crime ties.

And just days for smoking crack cocaine, he admitted on Thursday he was ‘extremely, extremely inebriated’ in a short expletive-laden video posted online.

The news hit as a campaign by some city councilors to ask the Ontario provincial government to remove Ford from office gathered steam. Toronto city council does not have the power to remove Ford itself.

The blurry, 80-second clip, posted on the Toronto Star newspaper's website and shown on Canadian television, shows a clearly agitated Ford ranting, making threats and pounding his hands together, while at least one other person seems to be goading him on.

Ford's tenacity has not come without criticism, but unlike in the United States, the city council of Toronto does not have the power to oust him no matter how much they might loathe the mayor's behavior

The Star said it had paid for the video, and said the context of the clip was not clear.

’He dies or I die,’ Ford says in the clip, which also refers to something happening ‘in that ring’.

He adds: ‘I need fucking 10 minutes to make sure he's dead. It'll be over in five minutes.’

It is difficult to force a mayor of Toronto out of office, unless he or she violates election or conflict of interest rules, or goes to prison. There are no recall elections of the sort that take place in the United States.

And even if there were, the mayor’s continued and inexplicable popularity—which by some counts had even risen following his admission of crack use—suggests a vote may not even help the cause of the city council desperate to oust him.
