A Kansas Middle School is under fire for a sexually explicit poster that was used in a sex-ed class.

The poster hung up at Hocker Middle School asks: 'How do people express their sexual feelings?' and then lists a series of sex acts ranging from anal and vaginal sex to saying 'I like you' and cuddling on the couch.

Mark Ellis told WDAF that his 13-year-old daughter was so shocked by the poster that she snapped a picture of it to show him.

Banned: The poster on the left was pulled from Hocker Middle School in Shawnee, Kansas after parents found out it was being used in the sex-ed class

At first, he thought it was a joke but when he called the school he found out it was actually part of the sex-ed class curriculum and that's when he got upset.

'Who approved this?' he asked. 'You know this had to pass through enough hands that someone should have said, "Wait a minute, these are 13-year-old kids, we do not need to be this in-depth with this sexual education type of program."'

At first, Shawnee School District spokesman Leigh Anne Neal defended the poster, saying it was in line with curriculum used across the country to promote abstinence.

'The item is meant to be part of a lesson, and so certainly as a standalone poster without the context of a teacher led discussion, I could see that there might be some cause for concern,' she said.

Mr Ellis complained that the curriculum needed to change or else he would pull his daughter from the school.

'This has nothing to do with abstinence or sexual reproduction,' he said. 'I would like to see that this particular portion of the curriculum is removed from the school.'

Mr Ellis was saved the trouble of having to transfer his daughter to another school when the poster was removed following a swift negative reaction.

Superintendent Dr Jim Hinson says that even he finds the poster troubling. He says neither he or the school board approved the poster - it was something instituted by the curriculum department

'I find that language offensive, I really do and so when we’re teaching human sexuality, again, there’s a balance. What’s appropriate at what age level? What’s not appropriate? It`s a really difficult decision,' Dr. Hinson said.

At the same time, Dr Hinson says society has changed a lot and children know more about sex today than their parents may be aware of.

Hocker Grove mother Jennifer Watland agrees, and that's why she signed a permission slip allowing her daughter Lyssa to take the sex-ed course.

Daughter Lyssa isn't troubled by the poster because people her age are already sexually active and they 'don't know the consequences'. 

'You can say all you want, that your children don’t know these things, but they’ve been knowing these things since maybe, the age of 10,' Lyssa said.

Mother Jennifer says she found the poster 'alarming' but she's not going to take her daughter out of the class.

'I’ve read through my daughter’s Facebook, seen her news feed and her friends on there. The things they’ve posted, you’d be astounded,' she said.
