Parts of Britain are submerged in floodwater this afternoon after a third of a month's rain fell within just two hours.

Emergency services in south London have described the downpours as 'biblical' as drains blocked up causing widespread flash-flooding in Lewisham.

Hail storms, thunder and lightning and heavy downpours hit large swathes of the UK today prompting the Met Office to issue severe weather warnings for the south-east and north-east.

Some of the worst weather has hit Lewisham, south-east London, with dozens of residents posting pictures on Twitter of cars driving through deep floodwater. 

John Gaffen uploaded a photo of the chaos with the caption: 'Its a Monsoon, with thunder hail and lightning in Lewisham, its quite bad!'

London Fire Brigade said it had been called out to about 20 separate flooding-related incidents in a little over an hour.

It said on its Twitter feed: 'We're attending a number of flooding incidents in East Greenwich and Sydenham due to the biblical downpours in south London.'

Most of the incidents were understood to have involved water getting into the basements of properties.

The fire service said one person was rescued from a flooded basement flat in Forest Hill, south London, after water 'entered via street drains due to heavy rain'. 

Elsewhere in the UK, Glastonbury in Somerset has also been subjected to severe flooding with much of the town's high street submerged in floodwater.

A video of the town centre shows fast-flowing water pouring down the main street after drains became overcome with rainfall which fell within just a couple of hours.

The Environment Agency has implemented 19 flood alerts across the country after forecasters warned 'in excess of 30mm (1.2in) of rain would fall within a two to three hour period'.  

The average rainfall for the UK for the whole of August is 89mm (3.5in).

Eight flood alerts are in place in the south-east, four in the Anglian region, one in the north-west and three each in the south west and Wales.

Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said the conditions were 'fairly typical' for late summer and said the downpours were expected to pass by tonight. 

'It is just some unstable air that is moving through, creating this rain. It will clear through by the end of the day,' she said.

However, she warned that the glorious weather experienced in July was unlikely to return – marking the end of Britain's summer.

She said the next six to 10 days looked 'unsettled', with heavy rain expected over the weekend and into next week.

The Environment Agency warned of the possibility of flooding this afternoon, as the unseasonably heavy rain combines with the highest tides of the year.

A spokesman said: 'There are 19 flood alerts in place, meaning flooding is possible.

'High spring tides continue today, bringing a risk of wave overtopping and spray in places, particularly when strong gusts of wind coincide with the time of high tides.

'Over the last week Environment Agency teams have been out on the ground, ensuring coastal flood defences are ready, rivers can flow freely and clearing trash screens.

'Since August 11 we've received reports of 15 properties flooded from coastal flooding. We will continue to support local councils as they respond to surface water flooding.'

End of summer: The Met Office said today's heavy rain marked the start of a run of bad weather which has ultimately put an abrupt end to the glorious weather of July

Temperatures are expected to plunge across the country next week with cold air from Scandinavia causing chilly winds and pushing the mercury close to freezing.

The Met Office said the mercury could drop as low as 2C (35.6F) in Scotland by Monday with the rest of the UK shivering in lows of around 8C (46.4F).

Forecaster Helen Chivers said an area of low pressure would also bring more rain and chilly winds to much of Britain.

She said: 'What is left of Bertha is now over Scandinavia, the low pressure that formed on Sunday and Monday is still causing a northerly air flow down across the country.

'On Saturday a new area of low pressure will move across Scotland during the day bringing more wind and rain and on Sunday it will continue to be breezy and showery.

'The low stays anchored over the North Sea next week and we will have a cool northerly wind blowing across the country.

'It will feel quite chilly at times at the start of next week with temperatures dropping off at night.'

Putting on a brave face: The wet weather marks the end of summer in the UK, with temperatures expected to plummet to around freezing next week. Pictured: Durham

Heavy rain: The Environment Agency issued a total of 19 flood alerts across the UK at midday as heavy rain lashed the country, particularly in Durham (above) and London

Rain, rain, go away: More than a third of the average rainfall for August fell across many parts of the country today, particularity in the south-east and Durham (above)

Leon Brown, forecaster for The Weather Channel, said the cooler outlook is thanks to a shift in position of the jet stream.

He said the cold flow of air could hold out for up to a fortnight, making for a miserable August Bank Holiday.

He said: 'We are entering a cool phase of weather across the UK, and for that matter also much of northern and central Europe.

'The jet stream has shifted so that low pressure will prevail to the east of the UK and winds will predominately be from a northerly direction for the next couple of weeks.

'Temperatures may be 3 to 4 degrees Celsius below normal next week.

'For the August Bank Holiday weekend in England and Wales the cool pattern should ease and temperatures lift back to normal, but it also looks like turning unsettled from the west with higher precipitation amounts over western Britain.'

Emergency
 services in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, were called into action to rescue a young boy who was almost 
washed out to sea by a huge wave.

The
 youngster was apparently taking a dip in the sea when he started to 
lose his balance in the waist-deep conditions as strong waves hit.

It comes as much of the UK is experiencing some of the highest tides of the year so far.

Coastguards
 were called out to rescue one young boy after members of the public 
feared he had got into difficulty while walking along the sea wall at 
Burnham-on-Sea

Burnham Coastguard Officer Ian Jefferies said: 'The boy was putting himself in a highly perilous position.

'He was very foolish to wade through such strong waves.

'Not only was he putting his own life at risk but also those who would have come out to try and rescue him.

'It
 is easy for people to get pulled over by the force of these waves, 
especially given this week's very high tides and strong winds.

'We strongly advise people to heed the warning signs and not put themselves in danger.'
