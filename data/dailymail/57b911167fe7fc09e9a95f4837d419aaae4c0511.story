Former cricket star Imran Khan has been injured after falling 15 feet off a stage at a political rally in Pakistan.

Khan fell at least 5 meters - 15 feet - off what appeared to be a makeshift elevator raising him up to the stage.

Local TV footage showed supporters carrying Khan away from the rally. His face was bloody and he appeared unconscious.

Khan, now one of Pakistan's most prominent politicians, was rushed to hospital after the incident today in Gulberg, near Ghalib market, in the eastern city of Lahore.

Dr. Mohammed Shafiq, who treated him, said Khan received seven stitches to a six-inch long wound in the head. He said the cut was not deep.

He is fully conscious and he was complaining of backache. He is fine, but he must have some rest for one or two days,' Shafiq said in comments aired on Geo News.

Hundreds of people gathered outside the hospital in the eastern city of Lahore awaiting word of his condition.

At 3.46pm, his ex-wife Jemima Khan tweeted: 'He's in hospital & conscious now'.

Bleeding: Imran Khan, who appeared to have blood on his face as he was carried from the rally, was rushed to Shaukat Khanum hospital

It is understood Khan fell after a 
sudden imbalance of the wood planks on the lifter due to an increase in 
weight as his security personnel accompanied him towards the stage.

One of the leaders of Khan's party, Ijaz Chaudhry, says the politician's injuries were not life-threatening.

PTI member Imran Ismail added: 'He has been taken to Shaukat Khanum hospital. He has lost [quite] a lot of blood and since, there was no ambulance we have taken him in our private cars.

Khan was due to address nine rallies in total today ahead of Saturday's general election.

Khan has emerged as a wild-card candidate, and it's unclear how much his massive personal popularity will translate into votes at the polls. But his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf is considered one of the top three parties in the country.

The Pakistan Cricket Board, meanwhile, has wished former skipper Imran Khan a 'speedy recovery'.

Early reports suggested Khan's injuries were not life-threatening and the PCB issued a statement of support.

'The PCB chairman Zaka Ashraf, the entire board management and national team has expressed its concern over Pakistan's former captain Imran Khan's injury in an accident Tuesday evening in Lahore and wished Imran Khan a most speedy recovery,' the statement read.

Dr Mohammed Shafiq, who treated Khan 
after the fall, told Geo News the former all-rounder had received seven 
stitches to a six-inch wound in his head, but expected him to recover.

'He is fully conscious and he was complaining of backache,' he said.

'He is fine, but he must have some rest for one or two days.'

Khan led Pakistan to the 1992 World Cup and has enjoyed popularity since turning to politics.

He has been a central figure in the 
hopes of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party ahead of Saturday's 
parliamentary elections, for which he had been vigorously campaigning in
recent days.
