A young actor was inspired to come out of the closet after featuring in a movie about homophobia in Australia.

Harry Cook, 23 from Sydney, was always advised in the past not to divulge that he was gay because it would limit the variety of acting variety roles he would be offered.

But when he took on the role  in the movie, Drown, which premieres on Wednesday night and tells of the struggles for gay men in the macho sporting arena, he decided to reveal his sexuality to the world in the form of a YouTube video.

Drown tells the story of the threat and confusion felt by the local surf lifesaving champion when he has his title taken off him a by a new club member who happens to be gay

The 23 year-old (right) was always told by his agents not to divulge that he was gay because it would limit the variety of acting variety roles he would be offered

'I was always told to keep my mouth shut - it was ridiculous,' he said.

'I was told only gay people played gay roles and straight people got all of the straight roles.

'It's like saying I can't play Nemo because I'm not a fish.'

Drown tells the story of the threat and confusion felt by the local  surf lifesaving champion when  he has his title taken off him a by a new club member who happens to be gay.

Although Harry doesn't play a gay character  - the theme of the movie was something that he could deeply relate to as he felt 'very shady and secretive'.

The defining moment when Harry decided he could no longer live a lie was when he was directly asked if he was gay in a radio interview just after filming finished up just a year ago.

'I completely shut down and said something like "that's personal",' he said.

'Then I decided I couldn't keep living like that - I was lying to myself and not being who I am.'

So, Harry made the very brave decision to tell the entire world that he was gay through a You Tue video in December 2013.

'A lot of actors said they applauded my bravery but they could never do what I did which I think is a really sad way to live,' he said.

'It felt really good - it was a huge weight off my shoulders because I felt I had been hiding a lot.'

'Whenever I was asked I would avoid the question and get out of it.'

The response from the coming out video was overwhelmingly positive with more than 70,000 views.

'They were even talking about it on TV in America - I was shocked how much of an effect it had,' he said.

'I just wanted to say this is who I am and thought it was no big deal but I received mind-blowing beautiful responses and only a couple of negative ones but nothing too brutal.'

Harry moved to Los Angeles a year ago to try to break into Hollywood which has made him notice that Australia still has a lot to learn when it comes to accepting homosexuals as equals in society.

'It's quite frightening how clear it is now that I have lived here - I knew it wasn't up to scratch with everybody else - I knew we were lacking a bit when it came to equality but I just didn't realise how bad it was,' he said.

'The U.S. has got 50 states and I think 37 now has got same sex marriage while none of them do in Australia - I think it's one of the last countries in the western world to be completely against it which I find very sad.'

Drown is showing:
