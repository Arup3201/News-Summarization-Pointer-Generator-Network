Real Madrid star Gareth Bale has hailed former club Southampton for propelling him to the top of the game.

The Galatico paid tribute to the south coast side’s highly successful youth system, where he started his career, as the Saints open a new £30million training complex on Wednesday.

Southampton’s academy has unearthed a host of top talent in recent years and Bale, who joined in 1999 before leaving for Tottenham in 2007, felt his time at the Saints was the best education in football.

‘Without being there, I don’t think I would be where I am today,’ Bale told Southampton’s official YouTube channel.

‘Since I was nine they looked after me. They really do take care of every step in your career and, for me, being at Southampton was the best education in football.

‘It’s probably the only club that can consistently produce young players like that. It’s a credit to everybody at the club.’

Household names such as Arsenal’s trio Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers are products of Southampton’s youth academy, along with the likes of Adam Lallana at Liverpool and Luke Shaw now at Manchester United.

Theo Walcott told Southampton’s Youtube channel ‘I would sum up my time at Southampton as one of the best decisions of my life.

‘They just know how to develop players, they never stop. They gave me an opportunity to show what I can do at such a young age.

‘Even if players move on, they have the right coaching staff just to develop the next one coming through.’

Ronald Koeman’s side are currently second in the Premier League after a superb start to the season, despite an exodus of their top players this summer. They’ll hope the new training complex can keep producing the talent to establish the club at the top end of the table.
