A clinically insane man, who killed his mother by slitting her throat, is missing and police believe he may be headed back to his old family home.

Samuel Mark Walsh, also know as Enoch Samuel Wright hasn't been seen since Sunday when he failed to return from an authorised leave of absence at Perth's psychiatric facility Romily house in Claremont.

In March 2007, the 38 year old was found not guilty of murdering his mother, Patricia Lynette Wright, at her Kalgoorlie home during a psychotic episode in 2005.

The court heard Walsh hit his mother with a sword, before he slit her throat with a bread knife and buried her in the backyard with his dog.

Perth Now reported, Supreme court justice Geoffrey Miller ruled Walsh was a chronically paranoid schizophrenic and was not criminally responsible for his actions because he was insane.

He was sentenced to be detained in a high security psychiatric unit, until January 2008 when he was recommended for release by way of leave of absence.

It's not until now that Walsh has failed to return from a leave of absence. 

Police are monitoring his hometown of Kalgoorlie as well as the family home where Walsh killed his mother, with the owner removed for his safety. 

It's believed he was last seen in Merredin, heading to the Goldfields. 

'It's upsetting considering a lot of us in this street have children that play out the front and I would have expected someone to come and knocked on my door on Sunday and told me that something had happened,' a resident told Nine News.

There's also a watch on hotels, motels and caravan parks in the area while police are also believed to be monitoring the Kalgoorlie church of christ where he was spotted the day after his mother's murder. 

Opposition leader Mark McGowan found it hard to believe that someone that committed such a heinous crime could be released.

'Whatever the circumstances in this way, and I think the government and premier needs to come out and explain.'

WA attorney general Michael Mischin said it's not known why Walsh failed to return, saying he had been compliant with the conditions of his leave in the past.

'Walsh's disappearance had been deal with in a timely and appropriate manner and he would seek a report on the incident once Walsh had been returned to detention,' he told Perth Now.

Police are warning the public they should not approach the 38 year old, labelling him unpredictable.

Walsh requires regular medication which it's believed he doesn't have with him.

He is described as 182cm tall, of slim build with brown hair and blue eyes but it is not known what he is wearing.

Police believe he could be driving a 1998 silver Hyundai Excel hatchback with the registration '1AFY124'.

There's a possibility his appearance could also be changed.
