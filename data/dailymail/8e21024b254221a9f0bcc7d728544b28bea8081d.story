The Girl Scouts' new health conscious cookie options have been put to the ultimate taste test by two children recruited by Grub Street to review the recently-launched recipes.

Earlier this month, the Girl Scouts announced the launch of three new cookie flavors - Trios, Toffee-tastic and Rah Rah Raisin - the first two of which are gluten-free, while the other contains a healthy mix of raisins, oatmeal and Greek yogurt.

But do the healthier cookie alternatives measure up to the high standards set by their predecessors?

According to Grub Street's budding taste testers - one of whom is the daughter of New York Magazine's own food critic Adam Platt - the answer is a resounding no.

Sweet treat: The gluten-free Toffee-tastic flavor is described as being 'buttery with sweet, crunchy golden toffee bits'

Less than impressed: Grub Street's young food critics were unimpressed with both the Rah Rah Raisin (L) and the Trios (R) cookie flavors

Upon tasting one of the gluten-free Trios, which are made with real peanut butter, chocolate chips and whole grain oats, Penelope Platt and her classmate Julia Millard Williams, both 11, were quick to deliver their - overwhelmingly - negative reviews of the treat.

'It doesn't even look very appetizing to me,' Julia explained, before even tasting the cookie. 'It's weirdly shaped.'

Penelope on the other hand, at least waited to sample the baked delight before deeming it to be 'rigid', with an odd texture that crumbles bizarrely in your mouth.

Both girls also pointed out that the Trios aren't packaged in the traditional Girl Scout cookie boxes, but instead are wrapped inside a plastic pouch. 

Moving on to the Rah Rah Raisin cookies, which are described on the Girls Scouts website as 'new hearty oatmeal cookies packed with plump raisins and Greek yogurt-flavored chunks', the girls were again left wanting in terms of flavor and ingredients.

Odd one out: For some reason, the Trios are sold in plastic pouches

While Julia described the cookie as 'okay', Penelope revealed that she wasn't sure raisin and oatmeal really worked as a flavor combination; both girls were unable to taste the Greek yogurt. 

'I was expecting to bite into a gooey raisin, but there was something else — maybe white chocolate?' Penelope added. 'It definitely tasted like a health cookie, or a cereal cookie.'

Both Penelope and Julia were big fans of the iconic Thin Mints, arguably the most popular cookie sold by the Girl Scouts, which was also the only one that both girls were able to recognize.

When it came to some of the other classic cookie flavors however, the results were equally underwhelming, with both girls insisting that the peanut-butter based Tagalongs were too salty, while the Trefoils were too 'lemon-y'.
