The bizarre life of internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom continues with strangers invited to  a spontaneous pool party at his New Zealand mansion to celebrate the All Blacks victory which ran until the crack of dawn.

The eccentric German millionaire, who now resides in Auckland, sent out a tweet before the All Blacks versus England match on Saturday, declaring if the New Zealand rugby team won he would ‘walk into a random bar in Auckland & pickup 20 ppl for a 38 degree pool party at the mansion.’

Predicting the team’s victory before the siren, the Internet Party founder sent a follow-up tweet saying the party was going ahead and asking for suggestions of bars to go to for the ‘victory pool party pickup.’

The founder of Mega, a file hosting service, then invited another 20 random punters to message him directly for the ‘secret mansion security password’ to gain VIP access to the party'.

Just before midnight, Dotcom arrived at 1885 in Auckland's Britomart precinct in a 4WD Mercedes with black tinted windows to whisk three women back to his Coatesville mansion, The New Zealand Herald reported.

The newly-single Dotcom, who is a father of five, was seen posing for selfies while the crowd cheered him on.

A tweet during the evening from the mogul suggested that noise complaints had been made: ‘Turn't down for what?! #PoolParty #AllBlacks #Whaaaat’

The wild bash wound up at 5am on Sunday with Dotcom tweeting: ‘he had a great night with total strangers who became friends. #Happiness’

As irony would have it, Ben Smith, an IT worker with the same name as the All Blacks wing player, was one of the lucky VIP guests; ‘Off to @KimDotcom mansion to party to celebrate the All Blacks win later on tonight! How exciting!’

But not everyone was quite so lucky to be a guest of Dotcom, who changed his name from Schmitz in 2005, with a few international followers expressing wishing to have Kiwi nationalities.

While Matt Adams tweeted that he was ‘gutted’ that he missed the shindig and asked him to have a party in London next time.

Meanwhile, Dotcom tweeted two hours later about the ‘great news’ that his four Filipina nannies to his five children, including twin girls, had received a 12 month extension on their works visas, in the same week Dotcom announced the end of his five-year marriage to Mona.

This is just yet another colourful chapter in the life of Dotcom who received a suspended prison sentence in Germany in 1994 for computer fraud and data espionage, and another suspended prison sentence in 2003 for insider trading and embezzlement.

New Zealand Police placed him in custody in  January 2012 in response to US charges of criminal copyright infringement in relation to his Megaupload website.

Dotcom was accused of costing the entertainment industry $500 million through pirated content uploaded to his file-sharing site.

He has vigorously denied the charges, and is fighting the attempt to extradite him to the United States.
