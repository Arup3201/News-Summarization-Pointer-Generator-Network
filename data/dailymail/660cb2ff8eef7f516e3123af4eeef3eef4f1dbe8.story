Kevin Pietersen says England have to find a place for Jos Buttler in their Test side immediately as the wicketkeeper is a 'game changer'.

Buttler scored the fastest one-day international century by an Englishman at Lord's on Saturday but is down the pecking order for a Test spot.

However Pietersen, in a Twitter conversation with David 'Bumble' Lloyd and former England captain Michael Vaughan, said: 'He HAS to play now! Talent like that needs to play on the international stage... game changer!'

Pietersen was responding after Lloyd suggested examples of Australian keepers who were thrust into the Test side: 'Marsh/Gilchrist not finished article when they played Tests. Buttler/ Bairstow outstanding prospects #vision Instead of 'Englishness'.'

And Vaughan replied: 'Spot on Dave... Only in England do we look at what can go wrong rather than what could go right' before KP had his say.

One of the few people with any doubt, it seems, is Buttler himself. He said after the ton against Sri Lanka: 'I am not ready for Test match cricket.

'It is a pretty easy assumption to make, looking at my game and where I am as a player.

'That is my honest opinion, and that is the opinion of others.'

Matt Prior is set to return for the Tests against Sri Lanka and Buttler
 believes he has work to do in front and behind the stumps to become the Sussex man's long-term successor - but that is his plan nonetheless.

'It is my hope and ambition to turn into someone who is talked about as a Test cricketer as quickly as I can.

'I average 32 in first-class cricket -
 and if I wasn't playing one-day cricket, I would not be at the 
forefront of anyone's mind with an average like that.

'My glovework needs to improve too, to be a Test match cricketer.'

And England captain Alastair Cook added: ‘Jos has certainly found his method in one-day cricket. But he’s yet to find the tempo he needs in first-class cricket and I think he would agree he needs more time to do that.

He will go on to have an outstanding career in Test cricket but, to be honest, I don’t think he’s ready for that now.’
