Alfred Lalara speared his brother through the nose after a card game got out of hand

A family dispute took a nasty turn when a Northern Territory man launched a spear at his brother, which became lodged in his nose.

Alfred Lalara and his partner had been playing cards with his brother and his wife, along with a group of their friends on a remote island off the mainland.

A Darwin court heart that the game turned sour for the 50-year-old when his brother's wife won the $1000 jackpot, and Lalara stormed off, according to NT News.

He then ripped his cards up, tossed a stone at a house nearby and left the game. The group were at Angurugu, a small area on Groote Eylandt.

Later that evening after another round the artist is said to have called his sibling and threatened to place a curse on his house.

The next day, the fight escalated to a physical level when the artist confronted his brother with two spears.

He launched two shovel-nose spears at the other man, the first of which missed. His sibling was holding a fishing spear gun but did not shoot it.

The second spear connected with his brother's face and went through his nose.

On Thursday, Lalara faced a Darwin court and admitted to aggravated assault and to going armed in public.
