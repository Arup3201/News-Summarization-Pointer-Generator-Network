Indonesia has announced that six prisoners will face execution at the weekend while the two Australians on death row will be executed together once their bid for clemency is officially rejected. 

Bali Nine members Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 33, are among the 20 death row prisoners listed and their schedule for execution could follow.

It comes after Sukumaran had his bid for clemency officially rejected, bringing him one step closer to facing the firing squad but Chan has yet to receive notice of his rejection.

The Indonesian Attorney-General HM Prasetyo said the pair will be dealt with together.

'When a crime is committed by more than one person the execution must be conducted at the same time,' he told reporters.

'So Myuran will wait for his turn.'

When asked if he had been under any pressure from foreign governments including Australia, Prasetyo said: 'so far, none'.

Meanwhile, four men and two women, imprisoned in three locations in Java, will be shot by a firing squad, starting on Sunday, the attorney-general said.

Among them are foreign drug offenders who are citizens of Malawi, Vietnam and Brazil. 

The remaining prisoners are two Indonesians and one man of uncertain citizenship who was born in Papua.

As plans for the six executions go forward, legal argument continues over how many requests can be filed for an appeal called a judicial review. 

Two death row prisoners last year requested an additional judicial review.

The attorney-general said for the six set for executions, 'All their judicial aspects have been fulfilled'.

He didn't know if the two requesting another appeal were in the group.

Prasetyo said the executions were in line with President Joko Widodo's determination to crack down on drug crime, which the government claims kill up to 40 Indonesians daily.

It comes after a spokesman for Indonesia's attorney-general said the list assumes President  Widodo will stick by his pledge to deny mercy to drug smugglers.

'That's what the president said,' Tony Spontana said. 

'It's clear and so we're confident.'

Sukumaran learned his last-ditch appeal had been formally rejected last week. 

Chan and Sukumaran's pleas for clemency were made more than two years ago, amid an unofficial moratorium on the use of the death penalty in Indonesia.

But hopes dimmed when Mr Joko declared he was against clemency for drug offenders late last year.

Five or six convicts are to be executed imminently, and the 20 others will follow.

The letter informing Sukumaran that his bid had failed said: 'there's not enough reason to give clemency to the convicted'. 

Chan's name is on the list of prisoners scheduled for execution this year, even though a letter rejecting his bid for presidential clemency has yet to be issued

However both men have made huge efforts in their rehabilitation, and help other inmates through art, cooking and mentoring programs.

In a message on his supporters' Facebook page on Tuesday, Chan said he was humbled by the birthday wishes he received.

'I am standing strong - we are standing strong,' he wrote.

'We are trusting that the Indonesian president will see that the work we are doing and the work we want to do will make a positive difference in rehabilitating people here and in other places too.'

Chan dreams of teaching hospitality classes and Sukumaran has more plans for his art.

'We are, with your encouragement, able to keep on doing that even in the current situation,' Chan wrote.

A potential new appeal avenue hinges on an argument between Indonesia's constitutional and supreme courts over how many times prisoners can seek judicial reviews.

The newly-appointed head of the constitutional court, Arief Hidayat, told the Koran Tempo newspaper the president should meet senior judges to sort out the wrangle.

He maintains his court's decision allowing multiple reviews should be applied uniformly.

'When the constitutional court has made a decision, it can't be interpreted any further,' he said.
