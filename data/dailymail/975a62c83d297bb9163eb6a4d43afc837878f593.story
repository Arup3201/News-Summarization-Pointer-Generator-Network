A male university rowing club is raising cash for an anti-homophobia charity - by posing naked in a camp tongue-in-cheek calendar.

The
 buff students from Warwick University Rowing Society ditched their
 life jackets to strip nude for the artistic photo shoot.

Featuring
 14 members of the upmarket university's rowing club, the men - aged between 18 and
 21 - can be seen frolicking by the River Avon and at in their boat 
house in Barford, Warks.

JANUARY: A male university rowing club have bared all by posing completely NUDE in their raunchiest ever charity calendar

Instead of the usual strategically placed oars, this year’s calendar aims to create a relaxed atmosphere by showing the group larking around on the riverside.

In one action shot, a muscular rower rugby tackles his blonde team-mate off the wooden jetty into the River Avon.

Other snaps show the lads squirting water bottles in each other’s faces while another shows a rower playfully tipping a bucket of water over his naked pals.

There is also a 
light-hearted nude tug-of-war where the flag attached to the middle of 
the rope just covers one rower’s modesty.

One
 of the rowers and the calendar’s organiser, Politics student Laurie 
Hulse, 21, said: 'It took us four days to shoot the calendar, all of 
which took place at our Boat House on the Avon in June.

'This
 year we have gone for a more natural feel, with fewer well placed oars 
and more natural scenes, basically what we do every day at the boat 
house but just naked.

'Getting
 naked wasn’t a problem really, were all good friends and after about 
five minutes it turned into four of the most hilarious days I’ve had at 
university.

'It didn’t take 
long for the water fight to become a ruck, with guys getting pushed in, 
which by chance made for a great calendar shot.

'We’re
 thrilled with the calendar, we think the photos look great and with all
 of the extra bonus photos and the film we look forward to raising lots 
of money for charity.'

AUGUST: Calendar organiser Laurie Hulse said: 'Getting naked wasn't a problem really, we're all good friends,'

The
 team are hoping to repeat on last year’s naked calendar which saw it 
sold out in days with orders coming from over 40 countries.

The
 hunky rowers have already built up an impressive celebrity fan base 
including Stephen Fry, John Barrowman, Boy George, Gok Wan and Derren 
Brown.

And this year the 
muscular athletes have decided to use their calendar to raise money 
for a charity which challenges homophobic bullying in schools.

Funds from the calendar and other products will go towards Educational Action Challenging Homophobia (EACH).

The
 registered charity is working with the rowers to develop a programme 
called Sport Allies that will see them going into schools and making 
viral videos.

They aim to help
 encourage young people who are being bullied about their sexual 
identity to call a national helpline and speak out about the abuse they 
suffer.

Rower Laurie added: 'Supporters wrote in to us explaining their experiences of homophobia 
and why the stance we were taking meant so much.

'This
 has motivated us to set up Sport Allies, Our very own outreach 
programme in partnership with EACH. We hope one day Sport Allies can 
become a charity itself.'

Director
 of EACH, Jonathan Charlesworth, said: “There can be a reluctance among 
males to be seen to be too bonded to their male friends in any emotional
 or physical way.

'The Warwick
 Rowers use tongue-in-cheek videos and photographs to challenge this, 
and in doing so I think they are taking constructive and positive stand 
against homophobia. We are proud to be the partner agency working with them.'

Former
 Warwick rower, two-time Olympian and World medallist Tom Solesbury, 
also applauded the team for tackling bullying and homophobia in schools.He said: 'I rowed for Warwick, and am delighted to see my old club doing such great work for charity and for young people.

'I
 think what they’re doing is very brave. I’ve faced many challenges in 
my Olympic career, but I have to take my hat off to the boys for this.'

London-based
 photographer Angus Malcolm, who has shot all five of the rowers’ 
calendars, added: 'This year I’ve aimed to create a lot more captured 
moments that show who the boys really are and how relaxed they are 
around each other.

'It’s very much part of the message we want to get across. And I hope they look good, too.'
