An English bulldog in Upstate New York is pawsitively living up to his rock star name.

Ozzy Pawsbourne the Prince of Barkness quickly became the viral of the week after footage of him swinging in a playground hit YouTube on Tuesday.

Owner Jesse Citron - a die-hard Black Sabbath fan who hails from Woodstock - admitted to having reservations in making the clip public, fearing a possible animal cruelty backlash.

But friends convinced him otherwise and said the video had to be shared. 

Rock star ride: Ozzy Pawsbourne the Prince of Barkness has become an internet star after a video of him swinging in a playground hit YouTube this week

Weeeee: Sophie Citron, 5, pushes her pet bulldog Ozzy on a swing in Kingston, New York 

Happy days: In the funny footage, Ozzy appears to love his foray on the swing set

Playtime: Ozzy is still just a pup and turned one-year-old in October, so its fitting he went in the child's swing

Citron told Yahoo News that he was playing with his five-year-old daughter, Sophie, at a park in Kingston when Ozzy took a liking to the swing set.

They decided to put him, and Sophie happily, albeit gently, pushed Ozzy along.

While the video has garnered almost 50,000 views, its biggest fan is Sophie.

'She asks to see the video all the time because she thinks it’s hilarious,' Citron told Yahoo.

'I thought maybe some animal rights activist might have a problem with it. 

'But I had too many friends tell me, ''That’s hilarious, you've got to put it up''.'

Ozzy is still a pup, and turned one in October.

Citron plans on shooting more videos.
