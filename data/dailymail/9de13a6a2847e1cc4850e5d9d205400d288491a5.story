A former social services chief claims he was ignored when he raised concerns about a paedophile network in the 1990s with Department of Health officials.

David Tombs says he was told by senior civil servants he was wasting his time because there were ‘too many of them [paedophiles] over there [in Parliament and Whitehall]’.

Mr Tombs, 80, former Herefordshire and Worcestershire social services head, said he tried to raise the alarm with the government following a major sex abuse scandal.

David Tombs - a former Herefordshire and Worcestershire social services head - says he was told by senior civil servants he was wasting his time because there were ‘too many of them [paedophiles] over there [in Parliament and Whitehall]’

His child protection team compiled a secret report in 1993, following a 12-month investigation into disgraced former child care consultant Peter Righton, who was arrested after child pornography was found at his home.

The arrest of Righton, a founder member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, unearthed suspicions of a child sex ring operating at the heart of the residential care system.

Mr Tombs told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday: ‘I was told I was probably wasting my time, that there were – and the words used were along these lines – “too many of them over there”.

‘Now, I was talking about paedophilia, I was in the Department of Health and the “over there” to me indicated – although the words weren’t used – was in Parliament or was in government and Whitehall. 

'I went to the department because I was concerned some of the names that came from the police investigation related to people in my own authority and it seemed to me there was a serious issue which would have been of national concern.

‘It was coming across to me that there were names there linked into the establishment if you like and I had no particular names, but that was the impression I was getting, and I felt the government needed to be alert to it.’

But Tim Yeo, the Minister responsible for social services at the time, dismissed the suggestions. 

He told Today: ‘I think it’s incredible. 

'There was no culture of child sex abuse that I was aware of either in Whitehall or in Parliament.’
