Angelo Fernandez, who is facing child abuse charges after his three-year-old son wandered off in the middle of the night

A father is facing charges of child abuse after his three-year-old son was found wandering the streets in the early hours of the morning.

The little boy was only found in Longmont, Colarado when he turned up on the doorstep of a house ten blocks away and was spotted by 12-year-old Rocklynn Moldonado.

The police were called and started to track down his parents, but it is alleged when officers knocked on the door of his father, Angelo Fernandez, he refused to answer and wouldn't go and collect the boy.

It is thought the toddler had wandered off from his home around 2.30 am on Friday morning and walked ten blocks by himself, wearing no shirt or shoes, just a pair of shorts.

It wasn't until Miss Moldonado heard a jiggling noise at the front door that she went to investigate and heard a voice at the other side.

She then found the boy, who was asking where his father was and crying.

It then took Longmont Police several hours to identify the boy and in turn track down his father Mr Fernandez.

After he allegedly refused to answer the door or collect his son, he eventually went to the police station.

But Mr Fernandez refutes the police's version of events saying he was the one that called them to report his son missing.

The boy wandered ten blocks to this street in Longmont, Colardo where he was found by by 12-year-old Rocklynn Moldonado

He told 7News Denver: 'I woke up and found my son had unlocked the door and left in the middle of the night while we were sleeping

'I took off, running around looking for him.'

Mr Fernandez has now been arrested for child abuse and the little boy has been placed in foster care.
