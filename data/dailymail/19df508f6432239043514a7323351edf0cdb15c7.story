A schoolboy was 'excluded' from   World Book Day celebrations after turning up dressed as a Fifty Shades of Grey character.

Liam Scholes, 11, arrived at Sale High School, Greater Manchester dressed as Christian Grey from the erotic novel, wearing a suit and holding cable ties and an eye mask.

But teachers failed to see the funny side and phoned his mother Nicola - who is herself a primary school teacher - to tell her the outfit was inappropriate.

Liam's mother said the costumer, which included cable ties and an eye mask, was just a bit of fun

Children around the country were encouraged to go to school dressed as literary characters yesterday as part of the global event.

Liam and his mother thought it would be fun for him to dress up as the character following the global success of the book by E.L. James, which has since been made into a Hollywood blockbuster.

But after packing her son off to school in the risqué outfit, Mrs Scholes was phoned and told he would not be allowed to participate in themed events or a planned class photo.

She said: 'We thought it was funny. We were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as Christian Grey.

'At first we laughed it off but the we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea.

'He went in a suit and shoes and with an eye mask and cable ties. The cable ties were tiny and not enough to do anything with them. We didn't think there would be a problem.

'I got a phone call home from the school saying the outfit was inappropriate and that he had been excluded from taking part or being in any of the photographs.'

Liam's mother Nicola said this morning that children his age knew about the book and its content

Ms Scholes said the costume was Liam's idea to amuse his friends. She said he hasn't read the book or seen the film (which features the character playing a piano) but knows about it from all the advertising of the film

She added: 'Me and the teacher agreed to disagree and it's not being taken any further but I was disappointed for Liam that he'd been stopped from taking part and that he's had a dressing down.

Was the school right to take action over schoolboy's Christian Grey outfit?

'One of the teachers went dressed as Dexter and I don't see why sex is seen as more offensive than murder.

'If it was a primary school I could understand but it's a secondary school and the book and the film have been everywhere - it's one of the most famous books in recent years and it's not like the pupils will be unaware of it.'

Liam told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'It's the content of the book that people might think is inappropriate, but I went in dressed as Christian Grey just for a laugh.' 

His mother told the programme that children his age knew about the book and everyone recognised the character when he arrived for class register. 

She insists her son - who hasn't read the book or seen the film - suggested the outfit after seeing advertising for the movie on TV and the internet.

Ms Scholes told Radio 4's Today Programme: 'I don't think I was breaking the rules. He went as a book character.

'Christian Grey is one of the most famous book characters of recent years.

'He's aware that the book is saying things of a sexual nature. If you looked on Twitter after the film came out it was everywhere.'

Despite the dispute, Ms Scholes insists she and the school have 'agreed to disagree' and there are 'no hard feelings'.

The Fifty Shades of Grey series has sold more than 100 million copies worldwide and depicts a relationship between college graduate Anastasia Steele, and a young business magnate, Christian Grey. It is notorious for explicit sex scenes involving bondage.

Sale High school has yet to comment on the row.

The book was recently turned into a Hollywood blockbuster, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan

Among the more traditional Oliver Twists, Burglar Bills and Where's Wallys, schools around Britain welcomed some more unusual 'literary' characters yesterday.

Jamie Peek, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, surprised his friends at Woods Loke primary by turning up as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

His mother, Caroline, said: 'He's mad about cars and a massive Top Gear fan so he told me he wanted to go as Jeremy Clarkson.'

Mrs Peek added: 'It was a bit of a strange costume to pull together but I got a wig from eBay and trimmed it to look right. Most of the clothes are his own. He even impersonated Jeremy Clarkson's grumpy faced Twitter profile picture for the class photo.

'He's got a number of Top Gear annuals and books. I think it's good for his reading.'

Parents around the country were divided over whether superheroes more famous for films than books, such as Ironman and Spiderman, count as literary characters.

But the biggest debate on Twitter centred around the army of girls dressed up as Princess Elsa and Princess Anna from Disney's Frozen seen turning up at schools.

Benjamin Johncock tweeted: 'A little girl is dressed up as Elsa from Frozen. I want to shout at her, THAT’S NOT A BOOK'

Hundreds of girls around the UK arrived dressed as Princess Elsa from Frozen, though some parents questioned whether the Disney characters is truly literary

Claire Anderson added: 'My daughter is VERY unimpressed by the 23(!!) girls dressed up in Frozen costumes for #WorldBookDay at school'

A website user called saraurora added: 'The boy dressed as an oompa-loompa in a sea of Elsa's and superheroes is my idol'

Others insisted Frozen now has plenty of follow-up books based on the film and is an adapted version the classic Snow Queen tale.

Atticus Beaterband replied: 'Frozen is a riff on the Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen so technically it maybe could sneak in under the bar?'
