A grieving mother has been asked to tear down a shrine to her stillborn baby daughter after council officials ruled it was not 'in keeping' with the rural graveyard where it is situated.

Jade Beadle, 24, covered daughter Tanya's grave in pink stones, put up a border fence and decorated it with children's toys after the baby died following a 39-week pregnancy last August.

Miss Beadle said the feeling of doing something for her lost child helps to comfort her and partner Sanbeep Bidla, 29, but they have now been ordered to tear it down.

Jade Beadle, 24, has been asked to remove this shrine to her stillborn daughter from a graveyard in Kindlington, Oxfordshire, by council chiefs who say it breaches regulations

The grave, which is inscribed with neon pink writing, features matching neon pink gravel, flowers, a series of children's toys, and a photograph of her stillborn daughter wearing a pink onesie. 

Council chiefs in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, have warned that she has until Saturday to comply otherwise they will call in a team to do it themselves.

A letter from Kidlington Parish Council said that 'trinkets and lights' placed on the grave violated rules at the council-owned cemetery. 

Miss Beadle, a supermarket assistant, said: 'It's not got any lanterns so there's no light bothering anyone, it's not got wind chimes so there's no noise bothering anyone. 

'As far as I am aware there have been no complaints from anyone about it.

'It's just a pink little grave for a little girl and I think they need to remember it was a little baby girl and her room was prepared full of her teddies and had pink walls and pink curtains.

'We just tried to make her grave as much like her room would have been as we could. 

'They want to take it off her grave to make the mower's job easier, well I want to have that stuff on the grave because it's not even been six months since I lost my daughter.

'That's how me and my partner cope, it's going down there and doing stuff for her garden. It makes us feel like she still needs us, she still needs us to do stuff for her.

'If that's taken away it's like she's being taken away from us all over again, because then she doesn't need me anymore.

Councillors wrote to Miss Beadle and partner Sanbeep Bidla telling them that the 'trinkets and lights' around the grave are not in keeping with the cemetry's appearance, and giving them until Saturday to remove them

Miss Beadle has refused to clear the tribute away, and has now got together a petition of 3,000 signatures asking for her to be allowed to keep the shrine in place

'They haven't handled it at all sensitively, and I feel angry about that because i just feel that if they had done their jobs properly and informed me about the rules in the first place then I wouldn't have had to go through all this heartache.

'The support has been amazing and I think a lot of the people are thinking that if they lost a child they would want to feel that they would be able to do whatever helps them to mourn.'

Instead of complying with the council's request, Miss Beadle and her friend, Charlotte Nichols, have drawn up a petition signed by 3,000 people asking councillors to back down.

Miss Nichols said: 'When you lose someone you love it leaves a huge well of pain and hurt inside of you. Sometimes having a grave for them gives you something to do to keep busy; something to focus on.

'Simple things like erecting a border filled with stones and putting ornaments down can make you feel like you are actively doing something for them.

'Your signature might mean that Jade can have the beautiful garden she has created for her daughter.'

Jade said she chose the council-run Kidlington Cemetery because the village's other cemetery, at St Mary's Church, did not have any room.

Explaining the council's decision, chairman David Betts said: 'We have a whole range of people buried there, they could be children, elderly people or parents.

'We have a set of rules that were drawn up in order that we could provide some commonality at all places, sensitivity, and a private place where the majority of people can visit in quiet tranquility.'

He said that he 'did not anticipate' the council changing its rules and added: 'If we changed the rules it means there could be a big debate about what is allowed and what isn't, we could have a list of things.'
