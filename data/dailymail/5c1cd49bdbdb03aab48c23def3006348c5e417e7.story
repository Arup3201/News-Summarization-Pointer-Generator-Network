Pack up those barbecue sets and dust off your umbrella and wellies - for summer is officially over and autumn has finally arrived. 

The sizzling temperatures of September are almost at an end, with weather more typical for this time of the year on the way.

It was the warmest September since 2006 and the driest since records began, but forecasters say Britain is set for cooler, wetter and windier weather in October.

The start of October will see showers and heavy rain in most places, according to the Met Office, and cooler temperatures with possible frost in parts.

For the second half of the month, wet and windy weather is forecast with dry and bright interludes.

A sea of mist hides farm houses and trees in Chollerford, Northumberland, as tempatures dropped to minus two in some low valleys - the start of October will see showers and heavy rain in most places, according to the Met Office, and cooler temperatures with possible frost in parts

The blanket of fog, from Chollerford, in Northumberland, will become more regular as the temperatures drop in October 

During October, forecasters predict it will feel much cooler, especially in the wet and windy spells and there is a risk of fog patches, such as this one, developing

The warm September followed on from the eighth wettest August on record and comes in a generally very wet year - this January to August is the wettest such period in the records, mainly as a result of the very wet start to the year and the wettest winter on record.

The dry conditions were caused by high pressure dominating the weather for much of the month. 

But that is set to make way for blustery and wet weather at the beginning of October, as the dominant areas of high pressure sitting over the UK through September finally give way to Atlantic lows.

Tony and Marie Newton, both 65, tend to their autumnal garden in Walsall, West Midlands, for two charity open days on October 25 and 26

The garden has raised more than £34,000 for the National Gardens Scheme and welcomed more than 10,700 visitors since 2006 

Over the 30 years the couple have lived here, they have put in more than 3,000 plants, squeezed into a 180 x 55ft space

The couple moved to the four-bedroom home in suburban Walsall in 1982 and began landscaping the neglected garden 10 years later when their four children no longer used it as a play area

It took two years to create, during evenings and weekends while they were both were working full-time, Mrs Newton (pictured) as a transport planner

Since retiring two years ago they devote up to eight hours every day to the upkeep of the Four Seasons Garden 

Kirk Waite, from the Met Office, said: 'Today will stay dry and fine for most people and will be another fine and quite warm day.

'But a band of rain will gradually move into Northern Ireland and Scotland tonight and will slowly move in a south easterly direction overnight.

'Much of England and Wales will be dry and clear overnight with a patch of mist and fog.

'Once in to tomorrow, the band of rain will edge south and will reach northern England by tomorrow afternoon, where it could turn quite heavy for a time. Because of that there could be potential disruption through the rush hour period.

'But for the south and east of England it will be a dry and warm day with maximum temperatures of 20 degrees. But that will probably be the last of the fine and dry weather for a while because the band of rain continues to work its way southwards in to Saturday.

There is a weather warning in place in Scotland today, the north of England, parts of Northern Ireland and Wales tomorrow and Saturday which could cause disruption

It will be a fine and dry day for the south of England today and tomorrow, but gradually the rain works its way southwards and there will be a noticeable change on Saturday, and it will feel much cooler

After a pleasant September, there will be a noticeable change to the weather on Saturday - which might mean the end of the punting season in Cambridge 

Punters on the River Cam, in Cambridge, made the most of the weather in September - but it will turn cooler and windier in October

People enjoyed the sunshine in Bristol this month - but the temperatures will shortly return to conditions more typical for this time of the year

'It will affect east parts of England on Saturday and we will see conditions coming down to normal temperatures for this time of the year - to 15 and 16 degrees. 

'There will be a noticeable change on Saturday and it will feel more autumnal and breezy. It will be quite a nice day on Sunday, but will feel cooler.' 

Thereafter, the trend for most places through next week will be generally unsettled with showers or longer spells of rain, which are likely to be heavy at times, mainly across western and northern parts. There are also likely to be some drier and brighter interludes in between. 

It will feel much cooler, especially in the wet and windy spells and there is a risk of frost and fog patches developing, particularly in the north.
