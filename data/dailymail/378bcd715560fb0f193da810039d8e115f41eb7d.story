Planning the perfect road trip isn't just about creating the ultimate playlist and getting a map - what you really need are algorithms.

Now the man behind the 'Where's Waldo' algorithm has created a road trip route revealing the best way to visit 48 US states.

Using a series of equation, the Michigan data scientist says his method can also be used on shorter journeys, beating Google maps on providing the best route possible.

Randy Olsen came up with the map when Discovery News challenged him to plot the best route across continental America.

His only limitation was to make one stop in all 48 contiguous US states, along with Washington D.C. and two stops in California.

Each stop would be at a national natural landmark, national historic site, national park or national monument. And the car could never leave US soil.

To create the map, Mr Olsen first found the shortest distance by road between each of the 50 landmarks provided.

The tricky part was putting the landmarks in order to eliminate as much driving back on himself as possible.

The man behind the 'Where's Waldo' algorithm has created a road trip route revealing the best way to visit 50 US states. The resulting 13,699-mile route would take 9.33 days of non-stop driving if you had the road to yourself

Rather than looking at every possible solution, Randy Olsen used something known as a 'genetic algorithms' which starts with just a few random solutions.

It then manipulates these solutions, while trying something slightly different each time, until it finds one that it can't improve on.

In his blog, Mr Olson explains how he used information from Google Maps API and wrote code to discover the optimum distance to drive to all 50 landmarks.

This was the same code he had previously created to discover Waldo – or Wally in the UK.

'With 50 landmarks to put in order, we would have to exhaustively evaluate 3 x 1064 possible routes to find the shortest one,' he wrote.

'If you started computing this problem on your home computer right now, you'd find the optimal route in about 9.64 x 1052 years — long after the sun has entered its red giant phase and devoured the Earth.

'This complication is why Google Map's route optimisation service only optimises routes of up 10 waypoints.'

The data scientist has also created another road trip map that makes stops at the top-ranked TripAdvisor cities.This map is 12,290 miles long and is similar to the original but skips over North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia

The resulting 13,699-mile route would take 9.33 days of non-stop driving if you had the road to yourself. Mr Olsen, however, advises putting aside two to three months to complete the trip.

'You'll hit every major area in the U.S. on this trip, and as an added bonus, you won't spend too long driving through the endless cornfields of Nebraska,' he wrote on his blog.

This map is 12,290 miles long and is similar to the original but skips over North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia.

'This is especially interesting because TripAdvisor reviewers recommend cities like Flint, Michigan — the seventh most crime-ridden city in the U.S. — over any city in North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia. I'll leave the interpretation of that fact to the reader,' Olson wrote.

Olson also created an ideal European road trip and he's released the code so that anyone can create their own route.

The European trip covers 16,287 miles and 14 days of driving, and Mr Olsen advises putting three months aside to explore the cities.
