Jean-Claude Juncker, the incoming president of the European Commission, has said he will address any gender imbalance through the portfolio selection

David Cameron was last night warned to send a woman to Europe or risk Britain forfeiting a top role at the European Commission.

Jean-Claude Juncker is piling pressure on national leaders to change their nominations for the Commission and put forward more female candidates.

The incoming President of the European Commission said women would have a ‘very good chance’ of getting the plum jobs.

Mr Juncker told an Austrian newspaper: ‘Unfortunately, and despite my repeated requests, most of the governments insist on sending male candidates.

‘A Commission without a significant number of women is, in my view, neither legitimate nor credible.

‘That is why I am continuing to insist with several heads of state and government that they send me a female candidate. In the end, should there still not be a sufficient number of women, I will need to redress the balance through the portfolio allocation.

‘Female commissioners will then certainly have very good chances of landing an important portfolio or of getting one of the most sought-after posts of vice-president, acting as my deputies.’

Mr Cameron has selected Lord Hill of Oareford as the candidate to be Britain’s European Commissioner - and will push for a key economic position.

The Prime Minister hopes the Conservative peer will be given an economic brief, such as competition or financial services, to help the Government obtain significant reforms in the European Union.

European leaders will discuss which countries are given the leading positions in the Commission this weekend at a dinner in Brussels, but crucially Mr Juncker will have the final say over appointments.

They will also choose a successor for Baroness Ashton, who was appointed EU foreign minister five years ago.

Lord Hill is little-known in European circles and his selection has caused tensions with Mr Juncker who reportedly had to Google the peer.

Mr Juncker has indicated that high-profile candidates, who have held senior ministerial jobs, will be well-placed for top positions, which may also make it less likely that Lord Hill will secure a leading portfolio.

It was reported that Mr Juncker’s staff had to perform an internet search on Mr Cameron’s choice as Britain’s new European Commissioner.

Earlier this summer Mr Cameron failed to block the appointment of the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg when he forced a vote of EU states on the selection of the politician - but lost it by 26 to two.

Mr Juncker is expected to name his appointments in three weeks’ time, but so far only four women have been publicly nominated for posts.

A Downing Street source told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Lord Hill is the right person for the job. He’s got the right blend of experience in business, as well as working at the highest levels of government, to be an extremely effective commissioner.’
