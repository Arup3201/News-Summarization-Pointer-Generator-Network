The humble egg is getting a makeover courtesy of Neil Rankin, executive chef at the UK’s only real wood barbecue restaurant, The Smokehouse in Islington, London.

A self-confessed 'egg pervert', Mr Rankin is set to change the way people think about the perfect protein with his newest venture Bad Egg, an all-day diner specialising in egg dishes.

The restaurant, on the ground floor of CityPoint in Moorgate will open its doors in late November.

Bad Egg will feature an international menu of dishes like North African baked eggs, Malaysian egg sambal (with galangal, dried shrimp and chilli) as well as a reworked full English.

‘The main egg categories are baked - as in North African style - and hashes, which uses many different regional interpretations,’ Mr Rankin told MailOnline Food. 

As well as eggs baked in sambal, the menu will offer chaat masala hash - spicy and crunchy with sweet tamarind and chilli; Chilaquiles - Mexican fried tortilla, with green salsa and peppers; huevos rancheros, and fried chicken and gravy hash, which Mr Rankin says is ‘like a roast dinner.’

‘In an industry where we sinfully over complicate things, eggs are an ideal way to lift a dish. They are also the most versatile ingredient in any kitchen.'

The physics graduate, who previously trained exclusively in French food, left the world of fine dining behind to work under famous barbecue chef Adam Perry Lang. 

The mentorship led the Edinburgh-born chef to eventually open The Smokehouse, via a stint as head chef at Pitt Cue Co in London. 

But eggs have always had a special place in his heart. 

'I suppose I am a bit of an egg pervert,' he told the Standard. 'My chefs get annoyed with me and say whenever I change a dish I always just put an egg on it.'

The egg fan told MailOnline Food that he is steering clear of classics like Eggs Benedict and soft-boiled eggs.

He said: ‘None of that tosh. We have a tomato, mozzarella and basil baked egg dish, and a plain burger. That’s about as simple as it gets.’

Head chef Daniel Merry will helm the restaurant but Mr Rankin says he will be very much involved in the beginning stages.

‘We have a head chef with a better cooking CV than I have by a long shot. I will be cooking there a lot initially but long-term, developing the menu and the service is with Dan,’he said.

Mr Rankin will not be using quail or ostrich eggs in his dishes, preferring instead to feature free-range chicken eggs.

‘Maybe some duck eggs but mostly chicken,’ he said. ‘That's not really the point, it's not an egg gimmick restaurant; it's about dishes that have a huge culinary history throughout every world cuisine but don't have a platform.

‘Most people set out to do a cuisine whereas here I want to champion dishes that I think can stand out by themselves.’

As well as eggs, the menu will feature four burgers, four chicken fried ribs, four tacos and some fresh Asian slaws and sides.
