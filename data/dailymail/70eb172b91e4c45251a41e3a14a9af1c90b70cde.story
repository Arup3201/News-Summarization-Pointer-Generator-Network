Actress Lynda Bellingham today defended her decision to stop chemotherapy, insisting she had not 'chosen to die'

Lynda Bellingham says she has not 'chosen to die', despite the fact she plans to stop having chemotherapy for bowel cancer.  

The 66-year-old actress has spoken at length in the past fortnight about her diagnosis and treatment, since announcing her condition was terminal. 

Today she said she had taken the decision about chemotherapy while at her wit's end with the pain and side effects of the treatment - and had wanted to get some control back over her life. 

Appearing on ITV's This Morning, she said: 'I haven't decided to die at all, no.

'I just sat down when I was in pain - there's no getting away from it with chemo - the ulcers in your throat, the thrush, plus the fact I'd had major, life-saving surgery for a perforated colon.

'When you're in terrible pain, you make decisions.' 

She told hosts Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: 'I want my husband and children to see me off happy, contented.

'So I put the chemotherapy in a box.

'In this box, I could stop the chemotherapy after Christmas - I'm determined to hang on until Christmas. 

'If my quality of life fades after that, I want to be able to open the box, make a choice and stop the chemotherapy.'

She said before this, she'd had no control over the decision - but had struggled with the idea of refusing treatment offered. 

'I don't want to look ungrateful,' she explained.

'The box [decision] is there to be used if I need it. 

'If my quality of life remains as it is now [after Christmas], then why would I hasten my death? '

Yesterday, appearing on BBC Breakfast, she explained she had the option to resume treatment if her health improves. 'It's there on the table if I want it,' she said. 

Lynda also admitted today there were times when she lay awake wondering about the future.

Speaking about her new book, There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell you, she said: 'The book is for everyone - every single day people are going through this.

'As my oncologist says, the smallest cancer cell can outwit the brightest oncologist.

'There's no getting away from it with chemo - the ulcers in your throat, the thrush, plus the fact I'd had major, life-saving surgery for a perforated colon,' she said

Lynda, with husband Michael outside the ITV studios today, said the positive thing about having a long-term condition such as cancer meant she'd had time to talk and spend time with her family

'It's not a book going "oooh, I've for cancer". It's positive - grasp what people give you and turn everything around to be positive.'

For example, she added that having a long-term condition such as cancer had at least given her time to talk and enjoy time with her family, as well as make plans.

'To lose someone suddenly must be devastating - that is worse,' she said. 

'My family and I have had lots of chats, time to talk - you realise sometimes when you are a parent you don't ever really talk to your children.'

She said the topic of death had also been discussed. 

'As a society, we never talk about it, we never face it - even though it's everywhere. We must talk about death. Sit down, get your wills out the way. 

Lynda is now trying to get more people to talk about 'unsexy' conditions such as bowel cancer, and even joked about emptying her colostomy bag at Buckingham Palace after collecting her OBE

'People spend their last few months worrying about death, but not pinpointing [what it is about death] they are worried about - rather than focusing on everything they've got.' 

The prognosis, she said, had made her more vocal and empowered.

'I'm able to tell people what I really think,' she laughed.

She is also on a mission to speak about the unspeakable - bowel habits and bowel cancer - to sweep way the embarrassment surrounding the condition that often costs lives.

'Bowel cancer and bottoms aren't sexy,' she said. 

To prove a point, she even divulged details of her trip to the loo at Buckingham Palace when collecting her OBE. 

'When I visited the Royal toilet, I took my cream suede shoes off just in case.'

This was to protect them while emptied her colostomy bag - nicknamed Furby, which, she added, makes a 'tweeting noise- rather than a raspberry noise'.

'These things mustn't be embarrassing - they are part of life,' Lynda added. 

'For me, if two of three people read this and feel less alone, then I'm happy.'

When praised about her openness and honesty in discussing her cancer, she joked: 'After five years on Loose Women [the chat show where she was a panellist], everything knows everything about you anyway.

'People should be able to trust you. God forbid I don't die for another couple of years [after all this]!' 

She added the response to her speaking out about her diagnosis had been 'overwhelming'. 

'It keeps an old girl going,' she joked. 'Lots of people want you to console them, which is interesting, and you think "shouldn't it be the other way round"?

When asked if she was bitter about her diagnosis, she simply said: 'Don't go there.

'There is no point. I was stage four from day one, and people have been so kind. 

 'Instead, I want to be happy and talk.'

Chemotherapy treatment causes side effects because it kills some normal cells as well as cancer cells

Chemotherapy causes side effects because drugs that kill dividing cancer cells, also kill other normal cells in the body that divide too.

These include cells in the skin, hair and nails. The mouth, the lining of the digestive system and bone marrow are also affected.

Common side-effects of chemotherapy include: 

Tiredness

Treatment can cause tiredness, lethargy and fatigue which may last for quite a few months after the treatment ends.

Sickness

Many chemotherapy drugs cause nausea or vomiting, but this can usually be controlled with anti sickness medicines.

Mouth ulcers

Some drugs can make the lining of the mouth sore and cause mouth ulcers

Diarrhoea or constipation

This usually happens in the first few days after treatment.

Increased risk of infection

Chemotherapy drugs stops the bone marrow from making enough blood cells which leaves a person more at risk of catching infections that can be quite serious.

Hair, skin and nails

Chemotherapy treatment can make hair fall out, make your skin dry, sensitive and prone to rashes. Some people find their nails become dry, ridged and brittle.

Nerves

Numbness in the hands and feet, which sometimes feels like pins and needles is common because drugs can damage nerves.

Sex and fertility

People often feel tired and lose their libido when undergoing chemotherapy. Some drugs also affect fertility.
