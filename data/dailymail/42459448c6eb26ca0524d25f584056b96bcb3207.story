At least a quarter of Newcastle’s 4,200 travelling fans were not in their seats for kick-off. 

They were still queuing to get into the away end at White Hart Lane, with several posting pictures on Twitter and bemoaning the stewarding which they claim caused the delay. 

It wasn’t until 20 minutes in — by which point their team were already trailing to Nabil Bentaleb’s opener — that they all made it to their seats inside the stadium.

Spurs have scored in each of their last 26 home games in the League Cup. It was January 1999 in a goalless semi-final draw with Wimbledon when they last drew a blank. 

Their team included three future or former Newcastle players — Stephen Carr, Sol Campbell and David Ginola. They won the second leg 1-0 before beating Leicester in the final.

A year after his exit and Andre Villas-Boas piped up to claim Tottenham broke promises, but Spurs retaliated by accusing him of ‘attempting to rewrite history’. 

AVB bemoaned the departures of Luka Modric (Spurs insist he knew about it all along) and Rafael van der Vaart (a sale he initiated). 

He also cited the failure to sign Willian, Joao Moutinho or Oscar. 

‘He has clearly forgotten the facts,’ said a Tottenham spokesman.

Alan Pardew named the strongest XI available to him, but that still meant four players on the bench who had yet to make a senior appearance. 

Goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, 17, defenders Remie Streete, 20, and Lubomir Satka, 19, and forward Callum Roberts, 17, are all graduates of the club’s academy and tipped for a big future. 

Roberts has been likened to Lionel Messi for the dribbles which have lit up Under 21 matches of late.
