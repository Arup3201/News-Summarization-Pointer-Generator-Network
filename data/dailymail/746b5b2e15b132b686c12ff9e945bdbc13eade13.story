A giant donut walkway could soon hover above New York's Grand Central Station in plans to restore the transport hub to its former glory as the glittering gateway into America's commercial heartland.

The circular gallery would be suspended hundreds of feet in the air between two skyscrapers and will move up and down to give visitors views across the city from different heights, similar to the London Eye.

The ambitious design is one of three proposals submitted to the Municipal Art Society of New York who will chose the winner after a lengthy public consultation.

With more than 21 million visitors every year, Grand Central Station is America's sixth most popular tourist attraction.

It was built by and named for the New York Central Railroad in 1871 during the heyday of American long-distance passenger rail travel. It was rebuilt in 1913 and remains the largest train station in the world by number of platforms: 44, with 67 tracks running along them.

Vistas: From its uppermost position, visitors will get to take in views that stretch miles into the distance, across New York's iconic cityscape

Vin Cipolla, president of MASNY, said: 'Grand Central itself is our most beloved landmark. It's the center of 
commercial New York. It's also a neighborhood. But yet, the area over 
the years, it has become somewhat disconnected and a little lonely at 
times, particularly in the evening.'

The blueprints were imagined by architect firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, who designed One World Trade Center, the building that has risen from the ashes of Ground Zero and is due for completion next year.

'Throughout the history of New York 
City, urban growth has been matched by grand civic gestures,' said Roger
 Duffy, Design Partner of SOM. 'This balance between growth and civic 
response can be seen in examples such as the Commissioners’ Plan of 1811
 which led to the gridded parceling of land, two zoning resolutions 
which recognized the potential for private development to shape the 
public realm and the creation of grand public place making such as Grand
 Central Terminal and the public parks of New York City.

Breath of fresh air: Commissioners of the project say while Grand Central itself is New York's most beloved landmark, the area has become 'disconnected and a little lonely at times, particularly in the evening'

Iconic: With more than 21 million visitors every year, Grand Central Station is America's sixth most popular tourist attraction

'With the Department of City 
Planning’s proposed up-zoning of East Midtown and the anticipated 
completion of East Side Access in 2019, the city prepares itself for a 
new phase of urban growth. A consequence of this imminent growth in 
population density will be an increased demand for public space.'

The Department of City Planning has proposed rezoning the area around the terminal to allow for a handful of new office towers.

The other proposals include an elevated glass walkway with seasonal grasses and a pedestrian plaza with sidewalk cafes and shops.

The proposed rezoning is still in the early stages of the public approval process.
