Health inspectors making checks on GPs’ surgeries are routinely snooping through the private medical records of patients without their consent.

Officials from the Care Quality Commission are demanding computer passwords from GPs to allow them to access the medical files of patients during routine inspections.

The watchdog claims it needs to see the records to monitor ‘clinical quality’ – such as whether doctors are giving out the correct advice or medication and following up on blood test results.

But senior doctors and health experts have described it as a ‘fishing exercise’ which threatens to undermine patient confidentiality. Dr Clare Gerada, former president of the Royal College of GPs, described the CQC’s actions as outrageous.

Care Quality Commission officials are looking at peoples' medical records, without consent, during inspections

Only yesterday the Daily Mail revealed that NHS officials are to press ahead with a highly controversial project of harvesting data from millions of patients’ records to store on a giant database.

They will shortly begin extracting information from up to 1.7million patients despite concerns from doctors that it will fall into the hands of hackers.

It has now emerged that the CQC is routinely trawling through patients’ medical records – stored on computers – as part of their inspections of 8,000 surgeries in England, which began in April. Inspectors are standing over GPs and practice managers and demanding they hand over the passwords enabling them to access the medical files.

They clearly state patients’ names, dates of birth and addresses as well as their complete medical history, including past conditions and complaints they may never have divulged to family or friends.

Rules on who can see medical records without seeking the patient’s consent are highly ambiguous.

The CQC claims it can trawl through them during routine inspections under the Health and Social Care Act 2008.

But guidelines from doctors’ regulator the General Medical Council say they should only be handed over in exceptional circumstances to the likes of the police, a court or health officials.

From time to time, researchers, private organisations or NHS trusts ask to see records in order to analyse trends. But the guidelines instruct GPs to provide them on an anonymous basis to protect patients’ identities, and only where there is a clear public interest, such as for research into certain diseases or NHS care.

Even the GMC can only get hold of records on an anonymous basis when investigating doctors who face being struck off.

Dr Gerada, a GP at the Hurley Group which runs practices and walk-in centres across London, said: ‘It’s outrageous. If this was my record I would not want it looked at by anybody without my consent.

‘The patient record is sacrosanct. It’s your secret record and unless you give consent no one should have access to it.’ Speaking to Pulse magazine, which was also made aware of the CQC’s actions, she later added: ‘I am surprised as to the ease that CQC can access patient records for inspection purposes where there has not been any previous identified patient or clinical performance issues.

‘Not even the GMC (General Medical Council) can, I believe, enter a practice and for no reason demand to see patient records.’

Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said it was vital private medical information remained confidential

Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘The confidentiality of private medical information is the basis of the trust that patients put in their family doctors and it is vital that this is not compromised.

‘If CQC inspectors want to have access to the private medical records of patients they need to put in place systems that obtain the explicit consent of patients.’

Roy Lilley, a health policy analyst and former chairman of an NHS trust, said: ‘Complete strangers are probing through our medical records. It’s just a fishing exercise in our most personal records.’

Ordinarily, doctors cannot hand over patient records without their consent to anyone except the police or another doctor or nurse treating them. This is enshrined in the GMC’s guidelines for doctors on patient confidentiality.

But the CQC claims it was granted legal powers to see the files without seeking consent under the Health and Social Care Act 2008. GPs whose surgeries are being inspected feel they have no choice but to hand over the records to inspectors in case they are given a bad rating.

The CQC would not say how many records inspectors look at for each surgery but the Mail understands they ask to see several at random. If the watchdog has concerns about a practice it may demand to see dozens more.

The CQC inspections of surgeries involve three or four inspectors, including a former GP or practice nurse as well as inspectors previously employed as NHS managers or council workers who have had training.

Nigel Sparrow, senior national GP adviser at the CQC, said: ‘The main purpose of the review of medical records is to assess the quality of care provided by the practice. It is not to assess the individual clinician. In routine inspections, the GP or nurse specialist adviser will look at the medical records.

‘Although the 2008 Health and Social Care Act does not require this, our view is that in most cases it is appropriate for the clinicians on the team to lead this aspect of the inspection.

‘This will usually be the case but where inspection teams have concerns about a practice it may be necessary for any of the inspectors to access medical records or to see a medical record.’

The CQC has a chequered past, missing several scandals, notably the abuse of vulnerable adults at the Winterbourne View care home near Bristol in 2011. Its plan to let relatives spy on care homes using secret cameras if they suspect loved ones are being abused were this week called an ‘admission of failure’.
