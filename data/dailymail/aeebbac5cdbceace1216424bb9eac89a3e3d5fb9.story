It may seem as though women are obsessed with shrinking their thighs to catwalk proportions.

But many - including Victoria Pendleton, who expressed sadness when she lost 10lbs during her time on Strictly Come Dancing - are proud of their muscular legs and they want clothes that will show them off.

But it can be hard for petite yet athletic women like Victoria to find perfectly fitting jeans.

Often having small waists but muscular thighs, they find the regular skinny shape that fits their waist is too tight on their legs, while those that fit the legs snugly leave a gap at the back of the waist.

Fit is the new skinny: COCBANG have launched an athletic jean making company for women who find it hard to get jeans to fit their muscular thighs but toned waists

But now one firm believes they have cracked the code to getting jeans that fit athletic girls.

COCABANG
- a clothing company which has launched a Kickstarter page to raise investment to manufacture the jeans on a large scale -
aims to make trousers for this genre of woman that they believe has been hitherto ignored 
in the fashion world: the muscular.

Writing on their site, the Texas-based company, set up by husband and wife team Larry and Gayla Allen, says: 'We have long enjoyed a lifestyle of 
staying active and strength training.

'Over time, while observing and 
speaking with friends in sports, competition and fitness, we learned 
that most athletic women resort to wearing gym clothes and sweats for 
daily apparel.

'The 
COCABANG line was created to fill that gap in the athletic women’s 
clothing market with ready-to-wear sportswear redesigned with 
body-conscious silhouettes.'

The jeans cost £47 ($75) and are available in waist size 25-33 and inseams from 30-36.

They have
been designed for women with larger glutes and thighs but smaller 
waists and aim to be stretchy, comfortable, but still stylish.

'We feel the realm of physical strength, 
competitiveness and enduring athletics is not the sole domain of men,' they say.

'Women throughout history have carried civilisations through challenges 
by the strength of their muscle and the power of their endurance.

'We 
need these formidable women today more than ever, women made with not 
only compassion and love, but with thin, invisible steel.

'And, if that 
steel happens to show on the outside as well, so be it,' they add.

'That’s why our 
logo says Fashion Behind Your Armor.'
