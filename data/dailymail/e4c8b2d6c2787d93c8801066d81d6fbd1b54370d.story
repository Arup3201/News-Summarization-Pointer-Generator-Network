The younger brother of disgraced financier Bernard Madoff - the loyal No. 2 at an investment firm that fronted a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme - pleaded guilty Friday, agreeing to serve 10 years in prison and saying he was 'in total shock' when he learned of the fraud.

Peter Madoff, 66, entered the plea Friday in a deal that permits him to remain free pending an October 4 sentencing. He had been taken into custody at his lawyer's midtown Manhattan office earlier in the morning.

The plea came in the same Manhattan courthouse where Bernard Madoff was led away in handcuffs in 2009 to serve a 150-year sentence.

Peter Madoff told the judge he was 
'deeply ashamed and terribly sorry' but that he didn't know about the 
scam until his brother revealed it in December 2008.

'I was in total shock,' he said of his brother's disclosure. 'My world was destroyed. I lost everything I worked for.'

The government has used the 
cooperation of six former employees and associates at Bernard L. Madoff 
Investment Securities LLC to learn what went on inside the secretive 
business.

Close to $20 billion vanished in the 
scam, the largest Ponzi scheme ever prosecuted in the U.S. The scheme 
left behind only a few hundred million dollars, not the $65 billion 
claimed in bogus financial statements.

Peter Madoff revealed in court that 
he agreed to assist his brother in sending out the only money left to 
favored people, including friends and family.

'I was shocked and devastated but 
nevertheless I did as my brother had said, as I had consistently done 
for decades,' he said. 'I knew that the conduct was wrong and I am 
deeply ashamed.' The checks never went out.

In his guilty plea, Bernard Madoff 
admitted his investment advisory business was a sham, but insisted that 
his brother and two sons who also worked for him were in the dark about 
his misdeeds.

The FBI nevertheless had been suspicious from the start 
about the role of Peter Madoff, who had worked side by side with his 
scheming brother for more than 40 years.

Peter Madoff sometimes signed many 
weeks of compliance reports in one sitting, intentionally changing pens 
and ink colors to make it appear he had signed them at various times, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa A. Baroni told U.S. District Judge Laura 
Taylor Swain.

She said he also arranged for his wife to have a no-show 
job at the company, allowing her to receive salary.

FBI Assistant Director Janice K. 
Fedarcyk said Peter Madoff played an 'essential enabling role' in the 
scam by certifying fabricated investment results.

'The Madoff investment empire, built 
on a foundation of deceit, was a house of cards that grew to skyscraper 
proportions,' she said. 'As Peter Madoff has admitted today, he was one 
of the chief architects.'

Peter Madoff was being released on $5
million bail, secured by $1 million in cash or property, pending 
sentencing. Prosecutors said Peter Madoff agreed to give up all his 
assets.

'Peter Madoff enabled the largest 
fraud in human history. He will now be jailed well into old age, and he 
will forfeit virtually every penny he has,' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara 
said. 'We are not yet finished calling to account everyone responsible 
for the epic fraud of Bernard Madoff and the epic pain of his many 
victims.'

Friends and business associates had 
described the brothers as very close. Their offices in midtown Manhattan
were a few feet apart. Their families vacationed together.

Peter Madoff was credited with 
creating a computer trading system for the firm in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s that was considered groundbreaking at the time. He ran the 
daily trading operation while his brother focused on the more secretive 
investment advisory arm.

Both brothers made a fortune. Peter Madoff owned a Palm Beach, Fla., vacation house that recently sold for $5.5 million.

When Bernard Madoff was arrested, 
Peter Madoff broke the news to Madoff Securities employees. And he was a
co-signer on a $10 million bond that won his brother's release. Through
attorneys, he denied any wrongdoing.

But the denial didn't stop federal 
authorities from moving to freeze Peter Madoff's assets. He agreed not 
to dispose of his assets and promised to curtail his personal spending 
as the investigation moved forward. His living expenses were capped at 
$10,000 a month.

A trustee appointed to recover stolen
assets also came after Peter Madoff, accusing him of financing his 
high-end lifestyle through the fraud.

A complaint filed in bankruptcy court
alleged that the Madoff investment business had transferred more than 
$77million to Peter Madoff. It said that between 1993 and 2008, he was 
paid a total of $36million in salary and bonuses.

And it identified other income for 
Peter Madoff as memberships to country clubs, including Glen Oaks Club 
in New York and one of Donald Trump's country clubs.

Given Peter Madoff's 'level of 
financial experience and sophistication,' he either knew or should have 
known that he reaped gains from 'fraud and deception,' the trustee 
alleged.

The trustee also took aim at his 
daughter Shana, who once worked as an in-house lawyer at the firm and 
has denied involvement in the scheme.

'Had Peter, as the Chief Compliance 
Officer, or Shana, as Compliance Counsel, done their jobs properly, the 
fraud might have been revealed years earlier,' the complaint said. 
'Either they failed completely to carry out their required 
supervisory/compliance roles, or they knew about the fraud but covered 
it up.'

Defense lawyers responded by branding
the complaint 'a sensationalistic attempt to lump together members of 
the Madoff family and create liability by association.' Their court 
papers claimed the scandal has 'left Peter Madoff mired in litigation, 
and has devastated his family emotionally and financially.'
