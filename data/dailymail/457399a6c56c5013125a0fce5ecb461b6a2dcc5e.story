Status symbol? Stun guns up to 20 times more powerful are being illegally imported into Britain

Stun guns up to 20 times more powerful than police Tasers are being illegally imported into Britain.

The weapons, which can discharge up to one million volts, are highly prized by members of the criminal underworld.

An investigation found they can be easily imported into the country via overseas mail order websites.

For as little as £60 one German security specialist sold a potentially deadly stun gun without asking any questions about the age or status of the customer.

Several days later, the illegal weapon arrived by post. It came with a free can of pepper spray, which is also illegal. Another more powerful weapon, which packs a million-volt punch, cost just £90.

Police suspect the stun guns were among hundreds which slip through Customs checks undetected every year. Up to 10,000 such weapons are believed to be in the hands of criminals who use them as a ‘status symbol’, for protection and to enforce debt payments.

Electric stun guns are prohibited under the Firearms Act and the maximum penalty for possessing one is ten years’ imprisonment. One police source said: ‘Stun guns are often found during raids on drug dealers. The evidence is that criminals want to own them but they rarely use them.

‘The attraction is they fit in a pocket and can immobilise someone without leaving a permanent injury. Also, even though they are classified as a firearm, the courts sometimes treat people caught with them more leniently than if they had a gun or knife.’

The trade was highlighted in an investigation by the BBC’s Inside Out programme which purchased two devices by mail order.

Both weapons, made legally abroad, sailed through specialist Customs checks at Britain’s parcel hubs. At one million volts, one of the guns was 20 times more powerful than the 50,000-volt weapons carried by police.

Metropolitan Police figures  reveal 
more than 200 crimes involving the weapons over the past three years in 
London alone. They include 139 robberies and more than 50 offences where
 people were assaulted or harassed with the weapons. During that period 
police in the capital seized 498 stun guns.

Eran
 Bauer, safety adviser with Civil Defence Supply, which trains police in the use of Tasers,, described the million-volt stun gun as ‘one heck of a brute’.

He
 said: ‘That’s lightning – horrendous tool. I don’t believe you managed 
to get one of these. That is seriously dangerous.

‘You are going to end up with skin burns for a start, and subcutaneous [under the skin] damage.

‘If
 it goes into the neck across the nerves you can just imagine the 
damage. Hit across the chest then anything could happen – [it could] end
 up killing someone.’

The 
investigation comes less than 18 months after the Serious Organised 
Crime Agency shut down the overseas operation of a US company selling 
stun guns and pepper sprays. It was found to be behind almost 
three-quarters of all stun guns sent by post to Britain.

Former Detective Chief Inspector Pete Kirkham said stun guns  have become the weapon of choice for many criminals.

Keith
 Vaz MP, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘How is it
 possible to go online and get a gun into this country through what we 
are told is one of the most sophisticated borders in the world?

‘I intend to raise the matter with the head of the Border Agency and the Home Secretary.’

In an earlier version of this article, Civil Defence Supply Limited  were referred to as being a supplier of Tasers to the police.  We are happy to clarify this is not the case.
