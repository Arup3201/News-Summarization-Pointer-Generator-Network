On the day Prince Charles voiced his fears that many Britons were losing connection with the countryside, it has been announced that his Prince's Countryside Fund will benefit from the proceeds of the final fixture of the jumps season at Ascot on March 29.

Prince Charles wrote about his concerns in a foreword in Country Life magazine to mark his 66th birthday, also saying that many were 'increasingly suspicious' about farming.

The Prince wrote: 'Unlike in most parts of the continent of Europe, many people in the UK are now four or more generations removed from anyone who actually worked on the land – and it frequently shows in their attitudes.

'They have only a vague understanding of what farming is or does; and – as outsiders looking in – they are increasingly suspicious of it.'

The Prince Countryside Fund raceday has attracted special sponsors including Waitrose and Dairy Crest.

Since the Prince of Wales launched the Fund in 2010 it has played a vital role in providing grants to support rural communities right across the UK.

Helen Aldis, Manager for The Prince's Countryside Fund, said: 'The aim of the raceday is to support and create awareness of our work ensuring a sustainable future for the countryside.

'This is the first time we have held a fundraising event of this scale at a racecourse and we are excited to spread the word that we are the only charity dedicated to supporting the people who live and work in the countryside and showcase the valuable projects we have been able to support.'
