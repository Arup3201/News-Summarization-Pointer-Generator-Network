Wales begin their RBS 6 Nations campaign with a mouthwatering clash against England on Friday night.

The two rivals will go head-to-head at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff - a city that has thrown up some memorable matches between both nations.

Here, Sportsmail takes a trip down memory lane and selects five of the best games between the northern hemisphere foes over the years in the Welsh capital.

Wales 30 England 3 March 16, 2013 - Millennium Stadium 

Roared on by raucous home support under the closed roof, Wales deny England their first RBS 6 Nations title (and Grand Slam) under Stuart Lancaster. Defeat by fewer than seven points would still give Chris Robshaw’s men the trophy but England are blown away by two Alex Cuthbert tries. In Wales’s biggest ever victory over their bitter rivals, Leigh Halfpenny hits four penalties and Dan Biggar adds eight points with the boot.

Wales 11 England 9 February 5, 2005 - Millennium Stadium 

A permatanned Gavin Henson nails a 76th-minute penalty to secure Wales’s first win over England in Cardiff for 12 years. Shane Williams crosses for the only try of the game as Wales start their march towards a first Grand Slam since 1978. Henson has the measure of 18-year-old debutant Mathew Tait all evening, first smashing him after 22 seconds and later dumptackling the centre, providing an iconic Six Nations image.

Wales 15 England 44 February 3, 2001 - Millennium Stadium

A hat-trick from peroxide blond Will Greenwood sees England register their highest-ever points total in Wales. Matt Dawson also scores a double and Ben Cohen completes the rout, with Rob Howley and Scott Quinnell grabbing consolation scores for the Welsh. Sixteen of England’s match-day squad end up in the 2003 World Cup final 22.

Wales 6 England 25 Jan 19, 1991 - Cardiff Arms Park 

Seven penalties from Simon Hodgkinson secure England’s first Cardiff triumph since 1963. Mike Teague scores the only try of the game as England notch their first win of the Championship on their way to the Grand Slam, a feat they repeat the following season. Wales end the tournament joint bottom with Ireland - both without a victory.

Wales 0 England 12 Jan 18, 1913 - Cardiff Arms Park

England’s first win in a competitive international in Cardiff, thanks to scores from winger Vincent Coates and forward Cherry Pillman. Back when tries were worth three points and drop goals four, England’s defence prevails - they concede only four points in the whole tournament, all away to Ireland. This record propels England to their first Grand Slam and fifth overall title .
