Wading in: Deputy prime minister of Australia Wayne Swan said that the 'crazies' in the Tea Party present the biggest threat to the U.S. economy

Australia's deputy prime minister 
warned Friday that the greatest threat to the U.S. economy are the 
'cranks and crazies' in the Republican Party, a rare foray into American
domestic politics that was blasted by the opposition.

Wayne
Swan, who also serves as treasurer and is his center-left Labor Party 
government's ranking finance minister, took aim at the Tea Party during a
speech to a business forum, breaking a convention among Australia's 
major parties to steer clear of U.S. domestic political debates.

'Let's be blunt and acknowledge the 
biggest threat to the world's biggest economy are the cranks and crazies
that have taken over a part of the Republican Party,' Swan said.

He
said 'the extreme right Tea Party wing' of the Republican Party had 
held the national interest hostage during last year's debate over the 
U.S. borrowing limit despite President Barack Obama's 'goodwill and 
strong efforts.'

He 
said it was imperative that Congress reach an agreement to support 
growth and avoid a 'fiscal cliff' of deep government spending cuts and 
higher taxes in January, which he said could push the U.S. economy back 
into recession.

The conservative opposition said Swan's speech betrayed his 'hatred' of Republicans.

'The
Labor Party is peddling hatred and they're got to stop,' opposition 
treasury spokesman Joe Hockey told reporters. 'They hate the Republican 
Party. I'd like Wayne Swan to say something positive about someone 
somewhere.'Â 

Prime 
Minister Julia Gillard, who travels to New York next week to address the
United Nations General Assembly, defended her deputy's comments as 
'appropriate.'

'What 
happens in the U.S. economy matters to the world economy and it matters 
to us,' she told reporters. 'Wayne Swan was making that very common 
sense point today.'

Adam Lockyer, a lecturer at Sydney 
University's U.S. Studies Center, described Swan's speech as 'a clumsy 
political move' that left him open to attack from his political enemies.

Lockyer said Swan might have been 
attempting to link the Tea Party to the obstructionism of the Australian
opposition, which has thwarted Labor's legislative agenda in a 
finely-balanced Parliament.

Australia
has long maintained that its close relationship with Washington, and 
its 61-year-old defense alliance, remains strong regardless of who is in
the White House.

Former
conservative Prime Minister John Howard was widely criticized in 2007 
when he claimed Obama, then a Democratic presidential nominee, 
represented al-Qaeda's interests.

Howard,
a staunch U.S. ally in the Iraq war who lost elections later that year 
after 11 years in power, created one of the first controversies of 
Obama's presidential campaign by attacking his plan to withdraw troops.
