A central Pennsylvania mother and her live-in boyfriend have been arrested after police found her two children and her sickly grandmother living in a mobile home that was 'consumed with animal feces and filth.'

Monica Bohn, 31, and Michael Karns, 28, are both charged with with two counts of endangering the welfare of children and one count of recklessly endangering another person.

The grandmother was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where she was placed under immediate medical care. The children were taken into the custody of the county Children and Youth Services department.

Officers in Middlesex Township east of Harrisburg were called to the Regency Woods North Trailer Park after neighbors called police to report that three children were playing in the middle of a busy highway.

Two of the children were returned home, but the third said his mother and her boyfriend weren't home, but that his grandmother was taking care of him and his sibling.

The Harrisburg Patriot-News reports that when the officers arrived at the trailer, they became concerned for the children living there.

The child gave them permission to enter the home. Inside, they found horrendous living conditions. 

'The entire home was consumed with animal feces and filth,' according to a police report.

The children were taken into state custody and the elderly woman was taken by ambulance to the hospital for treatment.

Bohn and Karns were arrested later that evening.

Their Facebook pages show at least two dogs and cat. Among the family pets is a miniature dachshund named 'Coco Jelly Bean.'

Bohn appears to work at GameStop and Karns is employed at Al's Pizza in Mechanicsburg.
