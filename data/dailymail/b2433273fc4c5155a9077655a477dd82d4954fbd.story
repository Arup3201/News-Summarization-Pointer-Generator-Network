The house of the future could be built from plastic and look like a spider's web, if one group of conceptual architects have their way.

London-based architecture collective Softkill Design have created this concept for the first 3D printed house, and say the first prototype could be built by this summer.

They are the latest entrants to a race to construct the first 3D printed home, which could revolutionise house building and even potentially solve the UK's housing crisis.

The house of the future? This incredible design 
for a 3D printed home has been proposed by London-based architecture 
collective Softkill Design. The group, who are the latest to join the race to create the first 3D-printable home, say the first prototype could be built 
as soon as this summer

'It would take up to three weeks to have all the pieces fabricated,' said Gilles Retsin, a member of the collective, to Dezeen.com. 'Assembly on site is a one-day job, if the site is prepared before hand.'

He told the site that the house would stick together with velcro or button-like fasteners, dispensing with the need for traditional building techniques.

The proposal is a development of an earlier prototype printed house which was unveiled last October at the 3D Print Show in London, which, instead of solid walls, featured a fibrous nylon structure based on bones.

Protohouse 2.0, as it is known, takes the same minimalist approach, using just enough plastic material to maintain structural integrity.

Components will be manufactured off-site at existing 3D printing plants in laser-sintered bioplastic, which Mr Retsin said is will give better quality than printing on site with sand or concrete, as others have suggested.

He told Dezeen: 'These highly fibrous structures are only 0.7 millimetres thick.

'It's impossible to print those with stone, because there's not enough structure or strength or integrity in sand. In the factory environment you can go into stronger materials like plastics or metals.'

The cost of building the house has not been revealed, but Mr Retsin said the improved economies of scale offered by the burgeoning 3D printing industry means such homes could be economically competitive in the 'near future'.

Mr Retsin dismissed a rival 3D printed house project announced by Dutch studio Universe Architecture, since the proposal was only to print the formwork then complete the structure in concrete.

'So it's not that the actual building is 3D printed,' he said.
