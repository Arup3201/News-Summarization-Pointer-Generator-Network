Police have issued a warrant for the arrest of Denver Broncos' safety T.J. Ward after he allegedly got into a fight with staff at a Denver strip club earlier this month.

The scuffle ensued after the 27-year-old, who signed with the team just two months ago, brought alcohol into PT's All Nude after he thought the establishment had allowed him to do so, the Denver Post reported.

But once inside, he was questioned by wait staff and a confrontation ensued - with Ward allegedly throwing an object at a female bartender, sources told 9News.

Police, who have been investigating the incident for more than a week, have issued an arrest warrant for Ward on suspicion of 
misdemeanor assault and disturbing the peace.

When quizzed about the incident, Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson simply called it 'some type of disturbance at a nightclub'.

Authorities have been working with Ward and are waiting for him to surrender, Jackson said.

The NFL will monitor the situation and the team said they were also aware of it.

'We have been aware of this issue and will continue to review all of the facts,' the Broncos said in a team statement on Thursday.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell can discipline players regardless of the outcome of their legal issues, but the Post reported that it's unlikely he would be suspended for a misdemeanor.

It's not his first time his name has made headlines for his alleged antics off the field.

He was also reportedly in a fight outside a Los Angeles nightclub two years ago, but he was not arrested in connection with the case.

Ward was signed to the Broncos just two months ago after free agency opened in March.

He was one of three free agents signed by the Broncos as they made over their defense after their 43-8 loss to Seattle in the Super Bowl.

Pass-rusher DeMarcus Ware and cornerback Aqib Talib also joined the team.

Ward accepted a
 four-year, $22.5 million contract. He will make $7 million this season in signing 
bonus money and salary, the Post reported.

'He's going to bring energy and toughness
 to our secondary,' Broncos general manager John Elway said of Ward when
 he joined the team.
