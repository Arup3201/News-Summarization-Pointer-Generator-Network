Another student from the school, Ana Marquez-Greene, aged six, was also identified as a victim of the attack.

The little girl and her older brother had attended Linden Christian School nearby, before moving with their parents to Newtown in July and enrolling at Sandy Hook. Both children were inside the school when the shooting began.

Ana Marquez-Greene's father is Canadian jazz musician Jimmy Greene. The distraught father told MailOnline today that he couldn't find the words to express the loss of his daughter Ana.

Neighbors said that the family had only arrived in the affluent neighborhood two months ago and they hadn't had the chance to get to know them.

The number of cars outside the family
 residence suggested that the grieving family had been joined by loved 
ones since yesterday's tragic shooting.

Another victim has been named as six-year-old Jesse Lewis. His father Neil Heslin told the New York Post
 that he dropped his son off at school that morning and planned to 
return in the afternoon to join parents in the holiday tradition of 
making gingerbread houses.

Grace McDonnell, six, who was also 
killed, has been described as 'utterly adorable' and 'full of life'. She
 had blue eyes and hair that was so blonde that friends thought she 
looked like a 'little doll'.

Her parents are going through 'indescribable' pain, MailOnline has learned.

In a chilling twist, Lynn McDonnell, 45, a housewife, and Christopher, 49, a business executive, live in a $500,000 detached home in Sandy Hook, Connecticut that is just one street away from where alleged shooter Adam Lanza lived.

Another victim, six-year-old Noah Pozner, was also killed in the shooting. Rabbi Shaul Praver of Adath Israel in Newtown, Conn., told reporters that Pozner was 
shot execution style.'

'His little body could not endure so 
many bullets like that,' Rabbi Praver said on Saturday.

The spiritual leader said he was comforting the child's mother. The boy will be laid to res on Sunday.

Grief-stricken members of the community tied white balloons to the sign for Sandy Hook school today in honor of all those who lost their lives.

Outside Saint Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church in Newtown, Connecticut, mourners left teddy bears, flowers and lit candles for victims. 

Law enforcement sources said today 
that the bodies of the deceased have all been identified after being 
removed from the school in the middle of the night.

Over
 the course of the evening, parents were led into Sandy Brook Elementary
 school and asked to identify the bodies, sources said.

Further details from the medical examiner were expected later today.

United in grief: A banner on the highway reads 'We love you Sandy Hook Elementary' after 26 people were shot dead by a gunman

Principal
 
Dawn Hochsprung, 47, school psychologist Mary Sherlach, 56, and 
27-year-old Victoria Soto, a first grade teacher, as three of the eight 
adults found dead on Friday. 

Twenty-eight people died in the 
shooting rampage, including 20 young children between the ages of five 
and ten, alleged gunman Adam Lanza, who took his own life, and his 
mother, who was shot before the school massacre.

Passion: Victoria Soto, 27, was killed by the gunman after she threw herself in front of her students to save them

MailOnline can now reveal that Miss Soto
 sacrificed herself to save her students - throwing her body in front of
 the young children.

When 
Lanza began started firing at the school in suburban Newtown, 
Connecticut, some teachers dived under tables - but the Mrs Hochsprung 
and Mrs Sherlach never hesitated.

They ran into the hallway to confront the danger - and were murdered execution-style as a result . The New York Times reports that Mrs Hochsprung buzzed 
Lanza into the school, bypassing the newly-installed security system - 
recognizing him as the son of Nancy Lanza. It's unclear what Nancy Lanza's connection to the school was, if she had one at all.

Little did she know that Adam had 
already killed his mother at the home they shared nearby. He took three 
of her guns and used her car to drive to the school.

Diane Day, a school therapist, told the Wall Street Journal that she and several other teachers were in a meeting with Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach when the shooting began.

'We were there for about five minutes chatting and we heard, "pop pop pop,"' she said. 'I went under the table.'

The
 principal and the school psychologist had other ideas. They jumped out 
of their seat and ran toward the sound of the gunfire.

'They didn’t think twice about confronting or seeing what was going on,' Ms Day said.

Hero: Vicki Soto, 27, was trying to shield her first grade students from the gunman when she was shot

Killer: Adam Lanza shot dead 26 people, among them 20 children, at a Connecticut school on December 14

Rabbi Shaul Praver told MSNBC that Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach were killed execution-style. 

Tributes for all educators poured in on Friday night. A deeply distraught 10-year-old boy is a former student of Miss Soto, who had taught at the school five years, said she was 'really nice and funny.'

The woman's cousin, Jim Wiltsie, told ABC News that police said the 27-year-old was trying to shield her students and usher them into a closet when she came face to face with the gunman. 

'She put herself between the gunman and the children and that's when she was tragically shot and killed,' Mr Wiltsie said.

'I'm just proud that Vicki had the instincts to protect her kids from harm,' he continued.

'It brings peace to know that Vicki was doing what she loved, protecting the children and in our eyes she's a hero,' he added.

Jacob
 Riley told MailOnline Miss Soto liked to chew gum in class - something is not
 usually allowed for teachers. He said he often teased her about her 
habit - and she playfully teased him back.

She was popular with all the students, the young boy said.

Former school superintendent John Reed told the Connecticut Post that Mrs Sherlach was warm and cared deeply for her students.

'If there ever was a person, by qualifications and personality, to work with children, to be a school psychologist, it was Mary,' he said.

She was married and had two grown 
daughters in their 20s and enjoyed gardening, reading and the theater, 
according to her school biography. Mrs Hoschspring was happily married to her second husband and tweeted dozens of pictures of her school.

Friends and neighbors said it was immediately clear to everyone she knew that she loved her students and her school.

'I don’t think you could find a more positive place to bring students to every day,' she told a local newspaper recently.

Another tale of heroism came from an eight-year-old student who said a teacher pulled him from the hallway as bullets rang out.

'I saw some of the bullets going down the hall that I was right next to and then a teacher pulled me into her classroom,' the boy told CBS News.

'It sounded like someone was kicking a door,' he said of the piercing sound of the gunfire.

His relieved mother agreed, saying that the teacher saved her son's life.
