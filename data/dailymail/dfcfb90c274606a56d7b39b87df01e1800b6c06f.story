A divorced couple's bitter rift took a twisted turn when a Connecticut woman allegedly tried to hire a hit man to kill her ex-husband - and retained custody of their daughter.

For more than a year Eric and Tiffany Stevens battled over the rights to the eight-year-old girl, and control of a $50 million fund that is linked to her custody.

In July 2012 however, Mrs Stevens was arrested for allegedly offering a maintenance man $5,000 to kill her ex-husband.

Custody battle: Eric Stevens delivers a complaint on Thursday in his legal efforts to regain care of his daughter

Now, almost two years later, Mr Stevens says he doesn't know exactly where his daughter is, only that the woman who tried to have him killed still officially has custody.

'I think it's unconscionable,' Mr Stevens, whose $50 million in real estate will go to whoever has custody of the child.

A New York state police report said his ex-wife told officers when she was arrested that she was using cocaine and oxy condon, according to Fox CT.

Mrs Stevens, whose father is a multimillionaire, was out on bail one day after her arrest.

On Thursday, Mr Stevens filed a complaint with the Statewide Grievance Committee, which handles lawyer discipline cases, against the court-appointed guardian ad litem - or advocate - for his daughter in the custody case, alleging corruption and perjury.

It was the latest legal maneuver in divorce and custody cases that have produced nearly 180 motions and rulings - and extraordinary allegations by both sides - since Mr Stevens filed for divorce in 2009 after less than six years of marriage.

Three years later, police claim Mrs Stevens tried to have her former husband killed. The custody fight grew even more complicated a week after her arrest when her parents, with her support, filed a motion for custody of their only grandchild.

Mr Stevens filed a motion for immediate custody of his daughter in September 2012, citing his ex-wife's arrest, and Hartford Family Court Judge Leslie Olear rejected it without explanation, court records show.

Claims: Tiffany Stevens was arrested in 2012 on allegations that she tried to hire a hit man to kill Eric

His ex-wife's parents claim in court papers that he's unfit to be a parent, but Olear hasn't ruled on their custody request, either.

A secretary for Olear said the judge would not comment on the case. A state Judicial Branch spokeswoman says the branch doesn't comment on pending legal cases.

Mrs Stevens, 38, of Bloomfield, couldn't be reached for comment. She has pleaded not guilty and posted $1 million bail in the still-pending case. The lawyers in her criminal and Family Court cases didn't return messages seeking comment.

The guardian ad litem, Mary Bergamini, also did not return messages seeking comment.

Mr Stevens believes his daughter, who turns 9 in about two weeks, is living with his ex-wife, but says he can't be sure.

He says the girl also could be with either of Mrs Stevens' parents, Edward Khalily and Diana Rabbani, who live in different towns in Long Island, New York.

Mr Khalily is a principal of WEGO Chemical & Mineral Co, a large chemical distributor based in Great Neck.

Ms Rabbani declined to comment. Mr Khalily called Mr Stevens a liar before refusing further comment in a brief phone interview.

Mr Stevens said he hasn't seen his daughter since October 2011 because of Family Court orders.

His ex-wife was granted sole custody of their daughter as part of their 2011 divorce agreement, which provided Mr Stevens with supervised visits.

Now, he said there is only an order requiring that his daughter call him on weeknights.

Mr Stevens said that when his daughter calls, the number shows up as blocked on his caller ID, preventing him from knowing where she is calling from.

The case is rife with bitter allegations on both sides.

Documents filed by Mrs Stevens' lawyers include a psychological examination of her ex-husband saying he has depression with 'psychotic features' and an apparent personality disorder.

She also obtained a restraining order against him and accused him of threatening and harassing her and their daughter.

Mr Stevens denies the claims in the psychological exam and his ex-wife's allegations.

In August 2009, Mr Stevens was arrested for violating the restraining order by going to his daughter's school and unsuccessfully trying to buy a gun for $10,000 at a pawn shop, court records show.

He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless endangerment and was sentenced to probation.

Mr Stevens accuses his ex-wife of being a long-time drug addict. Court records show Mrs Stevens had to undergo random drug testing as part of the child custody case.

The case file in Family Court also includes a letter by the state Department of Children and Families saying officials had substantiated claims of physical and emotional neglect by Mrs Stevens against her daughter.

Hartford Democratic state represenatatives Minnie Gonzalez and Angel Arce accompanied Mr Stevens as he filed the complaint Thursday, saying they're trying to reform the Family Court system.

Meanwhile, Olear on Wednesday survived a close vote on her reconfirmation as a judge in the state House of Representatives, after parents frustrated with the Family Court system urged lawmakers to vote against her.

The House approved Olear on an unusually narrow vote for a judge reconfirmation, 78-67. Olear later cleared the Senate on a 28-4 vote.
