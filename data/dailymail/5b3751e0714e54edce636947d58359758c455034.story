Cancer patients can cut their risk of dying by up to half - by walking just one mile a day, experts claim

Cancer patients can cut their risk of dying by up to half – simply by walking just one mile a day, according to experts.

A study revealed physical activity as a ‘wonder drug’, with those diagnosed with breast and prostate cancers able to cut their risk of death by up to 40 per cent.

And for bowel cancer patients, doubling the walking distance was found to halve the risk of dying.

The calculations are based on walking one mile at a moderate pace of 3mph, which would take just 20 minutes a day.

The research by Walking for Health, a network of walking groups run by Macmillan Cancer Support and the Ramblers, found physical activity can also reduce the impact of some debilitating side effects of cancer treatment, such as swelling around the arm, anxiety, depression, fatigue, impaired mobility and weight changes.

The charity estimates that 1.6million of the two million people living with cancer in the UK are not active at recommended levels.

Ciarán Devane, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘Today’s research highlights the very simple reality – walking can save lives. 

‘We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to what is a very simple and obvious solution. Physical activity is a wonder drug and health care professionals must prescribe physical activity, such as walking, as a standard part of cancer recovery.’

Sandra Sayce, 51, who is married and lives in Middlesex, joined her local Walking for Health group in 2011 following years of treatment for melanoma.

She said ‘I had been ill with cancer for several years, which at its worst had left me unable to walk more than 50 metres.

‘When I joined my local Walking for Health group it gave me the push I needed to make those vital first steps back into physical activity; despite the cold January weather, I was able to take part in the simple, easy-going walk which was crucial to beginning my recovery.

‘Since then I’ve gone from strength, and I’ve started to feel more happy and less tired. I really do think that making the decision to go on that first walk was crucial to getting myself to the position I’m in now.’ 

It is unclear how activity helps, but the effect goes further than simply weight control, which cuts down on the amount of cancer-promoting hormones produced by body fat.

The latest thinking is exercise may break down oestrogen to produce ‘good’ metabolites that lower the risk of some cancers.

The reduction in risk of death from cancer is based on research review evidence in Macmillan Cancer Support’s Move More report.

It says breast cancer patients cut the risk by 40 per cent if they do recommended levels of activity, compared with those doing less than an hour a week.

The risk is reduced by 30 per cent for men with prostate cancer.

Bowel cancer sufferers who walk 18 miles a week – 2.5 miles or around 50 minutes a day – can cut their risk of dying by 50 per cent.

Walking for 150 minutes a week at 3mph results in total walking of 7.5 miles in a week – just over a mile, or 20 minutes a day.

Government guidelines advise all adults to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise including playing sport, running or aerobics every week.

Just 36 per cent of British women meet the moderate activity target.

Benedict Southworth, chief executive of the Ramblers, said: ‘The benefits of walking are numerous. It is increasingly clear that walking even short distances regularly can make the world of difference for those recovering from and managing cancer or other serious health conditions.

‘Walking for Health offers free, short group walks across England, which are the perfect way to build confidence and fitness in a friendly, supportive space.

‘All walks are led by friendly, knowledgeable people, specially trained for the job. Many of our walkers have long term conditions such as cancer themselves and find the companionship and fresh air a wonderful therapy.

‘We want to put walking at the centre of efforts to tackle physical inactivity and echo Macmillan’s call for health professionals to prescribe walking to those who are recovering from cancer or other health conditions.’
