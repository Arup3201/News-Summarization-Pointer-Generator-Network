Officials are concerned that the black market for marijuana in Colorado is undiminished following a series of violent incidents during illegal transactions of the drug.

As the country's first state to legalize marijuana, Colorado is being closely observed to determine the effect of legalization on marijuana-related crime.

Under Colorado law, it is legal to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, but authorities fear the measures could embolden illegal dealers and buyers, who believe they can escape prosecution.Â

While no one expected the state's 
first-in-the-nation recreational sales would eliminate the need for 
dangerous underground sales overnight, the violence has raised concerns 
among police, prosecutors and pot advocates that a black market for 
marijuana is alive and well in Colorado.

A 25-year-old is shot dead trying to sell
 marijuana the old-fashioned, illegal way. Two men from Texas set up a 
warehouse to grow more than they would ever need. And three people 
buying pot in a grocery store parking lot are robbed at gunpoint.

'It
 has done nothing more than enhance the opportunity for the black 
market,' said Lieutenant Mark Comte of the Colorado Springs police vice and 
narcotics unit.

'If you can get it tax-free on the corner, you're going 
to get it on the corner.'

It's difficult to measure whether there
 has been an increase in pot-related crimes beyond anecdotal reports 
because no one at either the federal or state levels is keeping track of
 the numbers of killings, robberies and other crimes linked directly to 
marijuana.

Pot advocates say
 the state is in a transition period, and while pot-related crimes will 
continue, they will begin to decline as more stores open and prices of 
legal marijuana decline.

'It's
 just a transition period,' activist Brian Vicente said. 'Marijuana was 
illegal for the last 80 years in our state, and there are some remnants 
of that still around. Certainly, much like alcohol, over time these 
underground dealers will fade away.'

Sales are due to begin in June in Washington, where authorities will be watching for similar cases.

'There's
 going to be a black market here,' said Commander Pat Slack of the Snohomish
 Regional Drug/Gang Task Force, which covers an area outside Seattle. 'There will be drug rip-offs and drug debts that haven't been paid. All 
of that is going to stay.'

Under
 Colorado's voter-approved law, it is legal to possess up to an ounce of
 marijuana. Authorities are concerned that means illegal dealers and 
buyers believe they can avoid prosecution. These dealers and their 
customers also tend to be targets, if robbers know they are flush with 
cash.

Arapahoe County, 
outside Denver, has seen 'a growing number of drug rips and outright 
burglaries and robberies of people who have large amounts of marijuana 
or cash on them,' said District Attorney George Brauchler.

His
 district has seen at least three homicides linked to pot in recent 
months and a rising number of robberies and home invasions.

Among
 them was a February case in which a 17-year-old boy said he 
accidentally shot and killed his girlfriend while robbing a man who had 
come to purchase weed.

Elsewhere,
 prosecutors say, Nathaniel Tallman, 25, was killed during a January 
drug deal when he was robbed and shot, and his body dumped in Wyoming.

The next month, a dealer mugged three people who were trying to buy marijuana from him in a Denver grocery store parking lot.

Such
 deals are the exception, said Vicente. The 'average customer' prefers 
to buy in a well-lit, regulated store, he said, citing the roughly $2 
million Colorado made in marijuana taxes in January alone.

Whether dangerous or not, it can still be cheaper to buy pot from a drug dealer.

Voters
 who approved recreational sales in Colorado also agreed to a 12.9 
per cent state sales tax and a 15 per cent excise tax on it. Local 
jurisdictions can also add their own taxes. Medical marijuana is taxed, 
too, but at a much lower rate - a 2.9 per cent sales tax.

Those
 taxes mean an ounce of pot can go for $400 or more at a 
state-sanctioned store, depending on quality and potency. An ounce on 
the street can run between $200 and $280, depending on how much a dealer
 wants to profit, Comte said.

Underground dealers also are not burdened by complex regulations and licenses.

'Those
 barriers to entry already create the potential for the black market, 
and then you add these taxes on top of it, and it makes it impossible to
 get rid of,' said Denver attorney Robert Corry, who helped write the 
pot legalization measure but opposed the taxes.

Corry, who has long represented marijuana dealers facing criminal charges, said his clientele has hardly diminished.

Comte's
 unit recently searched a warehouse where two men from Texas were 
growing 'so much more than they could ever need,' he said. Detectives 
charged them with possession of pot with intent to distribute.

If
 some Colorado drug dealers have lost business to legal retailers, some 
also have made up for it by transporting weed to other states.

A
 Lakewood man was arrested in March after postal inspectors intercepted a
 package he was mailing containing a pound of pot. Drug task force 
officers who later searched his home found scores of gallon-sized bags 
of marijuana and 76 plants.

Marijuana
 cases can be hard to prosecute and are not cost-effective, so police 
often prefer to focus attention on drugs like heroin and 
methamphetamine, Comte said.

One
 result, he said, is the feeling among illegal dealers that because 
retail sales are legal, authorities are looking the other way.

Mark
 Kleiman, a public policy professor at the University of California, Los
 Angeles, who is helping Washington set up its legal marijuana industry,
 said the black market's survival has less to do with taxes than with a 
shortage of legal stores.

Colorado has more than 160 state-licensed stores, but they remain concentrated in the Denver area. Many towns don't have any.

'When
 there are more stores and more products in the stores and prices settle
 down, then we'll see,' Kleiman said. 'I would be very surprised if the 
illicit market can compete at all.'
