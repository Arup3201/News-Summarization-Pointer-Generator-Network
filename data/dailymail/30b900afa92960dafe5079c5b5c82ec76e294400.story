A couple came face-to-face with with an exotic snake as they went to investigate what they thought was a 'black slug' in their back yard drain.

Linda Peek and her husband Geoff spotted the Mexican Black Kingsnake peek its head out of the grate at their home in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire.

The couple first thought it was 'a black slug' before the constrictor emerged from the drain and slithered around their back yard.

The couple's firefighter son Simon saved the day after guiding the snake into a recycling box

The couple’s firefighter son Simon, 37, eventually guided the snake into a recycling box after rushing to his parent’s house.

He then called a nearby reptile store and the owner came around to relieve the family of their intruder.

Reptile experts say the snake may have hatched from a nest of eggs which could have been laid in the sewers of Grimsby and Cleethorpes.

Mrs Peek, a 56-year-old supermarket worker, said: 'I just stood there looking at it, and as soon as its tongue came out, I knew it was a snake.

'I’m absolutely petrified of snakes and worms and anything creepy crawly, I was in pieces and didn’t know what to do.

'Geoff rang Simon, who said he would be ten minutes leaving work and told us to keep an eye on it. We did from inside, behind the door.

'We couldn’t get through to the RSPCA, so tried the police, who put us in touch with a local animal shelter. By that time, Simon had arrived to save the day.

'Geoff stood behind the door as Simon went outside. He loves his wildlife programmes and must have got some tips from them as he was great handling the snake.

'When Simon went to touch the snake’s tail, it arched around to try and bite him, but Simon managed to get the snake into a recycling box by putting a shovel on top of its head to control it.'

Mexican Black Kingsnakes can grow up to 4ft in length, with the average being about 2.5ft, and can live to up to 15-years-old.

Mrs Peek said: 'It’s something I can look back on and laugh at now, but it’s an experience I never want to live again.

'I can’t bear to even watch them on TV, they’re not my thing at all. I’m just grateful I wasn’t on my own, as I’d have probably passed out on the floor.'
