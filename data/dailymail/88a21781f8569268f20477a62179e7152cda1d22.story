Guilty: Joyce Porterfield claimed almost £24,000 of benefits after she told officials she was not married but was caught when her husband applied for a loan

A benefits cheat who managed to swindle £24,000 by claiming she was unmarried was ultimately undone by someone very close to home - her husband.

Joyce Porterfield, from Wythenshawe, near Manchester, took council tax and housing tax benefits she was not entitled to for six years.

Authorities did not pick up on the scam until they discovered the 57-year-old's husband had been applying for loans from the same address.

She denied two charges of failing to notify a change in circumstances but was found guilty at Manchester Crown Court, after illegally claiming the benefits between April 2006 and 2012.

Porterfield claimed she was separated from  husband Robert Porterfield and that they were living apart when she made the benefit claims.

But the court was told that he made applications for personal loans from the same address and confirmed she was his wife in the loan forms.

The offences were uncovered by council checks and their bank accounts were subsequently investigated. 

On one occasion both of them signed a loan document at the house in the presence of an agent who acted as a witness, the court heard.

Mr Porterfield had been working at the time but suffered a stroke in 2011, the court heard. His wife then became his carer.

Porterfield was given a jail sentence of six months, suspended for 18 months. She will also have to abide by night curfew which will be monitored by an electronic tag.

She has started paying the money back in deductions from benefits which she is now legally entitled to.

Judge Richard Mansell QC told her: ‘You were in receipt of housing benefit and council tax benefit based on the false premise that you were separated from and not living with your husband, Robert Porterfield.

‘Robert Porterfield was making loan applications at that same time as your husband from the same address.

‘You were motivated by wanting a better lifestyle. The message has to go out that those who defraud the taxpayer of benefits would ordinarily go to prison. The only thing that prevents me is a change in your domestic circumstances.’

The court heard the exact sum for council tax benefit was around £3,500 and more than £20,000 in housing tax benefit.

Alistair Reid, defending, said her husband was very vulnerable. He added: ‘There are no concerns from the Probation Service about any on-going criminality. Deductions are already being taken.’

Just last week topless model Nicola Haighton, 25, was exposed as a benefits cheat when investigators found pictures of her wedding on Facebook.

She had pocketed almost £4,000 in income support by claiming she was a single parent. The model, who has posed for FHM as a 'High Street Honey', failed to tell officials she got married in a lavish £6,000 ceremony in Clitheroe, Lancashire.

When she was confronted, she said she'd split from her husband just two days later. The mother, who had a breast enhancement treatment to help with her modelling career, said she had married on a ‘whim’ and regretted it straight away.

However the model, from Accrington, Lancashire, pleaded guilty at Blackburn Magistrates Court to failing to notify a change of circumstances which affected her entitlement to income support, council tax and housing benefit.

She was given a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay £100 costs.
