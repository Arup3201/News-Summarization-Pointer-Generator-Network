New research has revealed startling new figures about the cost of  childcare - which in some cases makes it financially pointless for mothers to return to work.

Mothers on a low income will lose essentially their entire pay packet to pay for two children in daycare, a study by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM) reveals.

A woman in a full-time role earning the minimum wage of $43,000 will only have one per cent of their income left after paying for daycare for two children.

The research also shows that when parents return to work, the government makes $1 billion more in taxes from childcare than they spend in childcare subsidies.

Every year, women with children in child care pay $7 billion in taxes.

However, the government only spends $6 billion for childcare subsidies.

Goodstart Early Learning Centre commissioned the report to appeal to the government to increase childcare subsidies.

Their advocacy manager, John Cherry, said an increase in subsidies is crucial not only to support working mothers, but also young children - particularly those from low income families.

'Australia's subsidies are well below those of most other developed countries,' says Mr Cherry, according to Sun Herald.

'This is contributing to our low level of female workforce participation and denying too many children from low-income households the opportunity to access quality early learning.'

In a report last month, NATSEM found that the national average childcare fee has risen by around 150 per cent since 2004, jumping from $30 to $75 a day for 'long day' care.

Parents and childcare workers are all appealing to the government to increase childcare subsidies, to ensure the quality of childcare is not compromised

The Abbott government wants to freeze childcare benefit income thresholds and continue to pause the childcare rebate limit at $7500 a child a year.

Both measures apply for three years and between them will save $336 million.

The Productivity Commission's draft report into the sector will be released tomorrow.

The final version will be delivered in October.
