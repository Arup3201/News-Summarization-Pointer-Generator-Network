Rape charges against former AFL footballer Stephen Milne have been dropped and he has pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of indecent assault.

The former St Kilda player was facing three charges of raping a 19-year-old woman at a teammate's house after a drunken night out in 2004.

The 34-year-old was scheduled to face a 10-day trial in the Victorian County Court later this month.

Milne pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting the woman in a darkened room, with former teammate Leigh Montagna and another woman nearby.

Stephen Milne, who was joined in court with his wife Melissa, was cleared of three rape charges

Prosecutor Mark Rochford SC said the victim believed Milne was Mr Montagna.

'The accused was reckless as to whether the complainant was consenting or not to the relevant act,' he told the court.

Milne arrived at court on Thursday with his wife Melissa.

He was also supported in court by St Kilda captain Nick Riewoldt and recently retired Saints midfielder Lenny Hayes.

Milne pleaded guilty to the charge after the Office of Public Prosecution dropped the three rape charges.

Mr Rochford said the maximum penalty for indecent assault was 10 years' jail.

'All sentencing options are open,' he said.

Milne's barrister Philip Dunn QC asked Judge Michael Bourke to hand Milne a fine without conviction.

Milne retired last year after playing more than 250 game for St Kilda

He said the offence was more than 10 years old and Milne had not offended since.

Mr Dunn described the offending as 'unplanned, spontaneous and momentary'.

He said it occurred in the context of alcohol consumption and in a dark room.

But Mr Dunn acknowledged Milne had offended after the victim had been clear in saying 'no'.

'His recklessness was a misread of the situation,' Mr Dunn said.

'It was an attempt to get her to change her mind.'

He also said Milne and his family had suffered a decade of abuse, in which crowds chanted 'rapist' at St Kilda's AFL games.

Mr Dunn described one incident in which Milne's partner took photos of his 250th AFL game and was insulted by a K-Mart employee when she went to have them printed.

'What do you want a photo of a rapist for?' she was asked.

The plea hearing continues.
