ITV’s shock axing of Adrian Chiles allows the network to introduce Mark Pougatch as their new lead football presenter ahead of a fiercely fought TV auction for Premier League highlights.

ITV Sport will bid strongly against BBC’s Match of the Day for TV rights to be awarded in around a week’s time and the commercial channel wanted to complete their reshuffle of on-screen football talent before then.

It is expected that the price of the highlights package, for which the BBC paid £183million for their current three-year deal, could rise to as much as £300m and ITV have the deeper pockets.

But this is one flagship contract that the BBC — faced with losing golf’s Open Championship to Sky — are desperate to keep more than any other apart from Wimbledon.

Unpopular with viewers, Chiles was the subject of a Facebook campaign — attracting more than 37,000 ‘likes’ — to have him removed from hosting ITV football after the last World Cup. He was told this week his contract was being terminated.

Chiles signed a £500,000 one-year renewal last April that expires at the end of the season. At the time he took a whopping £1m salary cut because the extension just covered his dwindling football presenting duties.

He joined ITV from the BBC on a £6m four-year contract in 2010 which included hosting breakfast show Daybreak. Since the demise of that programme and ITV losing live rights to the FA Cup, Champions League and Europa League, Chiles was increasingly seen as a luxury who did little for the ratings.

The 47-year-old Brummie was trying to negotiate new terms when ITV started their football revamp by announcing earlier this month that second-choice presenter Matt Smith’s contract would not be renewed at the end of the season and pundit Andy Townsend would be leaving by mutual consent.

Instead of a new agreement, Chiles has been shown the door. He leaves immediately with ITV’s unusual ‘no comment’ about anything to do with his exit suggesting there is a legal fight brewing over the size of his pay-off.

Pougatch will be in the hot seat for ITV’s next live match on February 17, the first leg of Chelsea’s Champions League tie with Paris Saint-Germain but will continue to work for BBC Radio 5 Live.

He will reduce his football involvement on 5 Live to avoid conflict with his ITV role. Highly regarded at the BBC, Pougatch would not have moved if not for the potential promise of a lot more football work than Champions League highlights and England matches after this season — if ITV win rights to Premier League highlights

Chiles’s departure brought a hugely positive reaction on social media. So it is ironic that it was Chiles who won the presenter shootout against Pougatch when the BBC launched their Sunday Premier League highlights show, Match of the Day 2 in 2004.

Pougatch was strong favourite before a late change of mind by the Beeb executive who felt Chiles’s Brummie vowels would go down better than Pougatch’s public school accent honed at Malvern College. Eleven years on it is posh ‘Poogs’ who finally has the upper hand.

Pougatch said: ‘I am delighted to be given this great opportunity. I’m looking forward to working with ITV’s talented pool of commentators and pundits.’

Niall Sloane, ITV director of sport, said: ‘Mark is a highly respected sports journalist and outstanding broadcaster. We’re delighted to welcome him.’

Mark Pougatch has joined ITV Sport as a presenter for the channel's football coverage.

Mark joins the ITV Sport team as the Champions League and Europa League enter their knockout rounds and England's Euro 16 qualifying stages are set to resume.

He will appear alongside ITV's panel of pundits, commentary and reporting team for the live England international and European football programmes from February.

He brings with him a wealth of experience in sports broadcasting over 20 years, including presenting major events such as World Cups, European Championships and the Olympics.

Mark said: 'I am absolutely delighted to be joining ITV and to be given this great opportunity. I'm looking forward to working with ITV's talented pool of commentators and pundits on some of the very best football there is.'

ITV Director of Sport, Niall Sloane, said: 'Mark is a highly-respected sports journalist and an outstanding broadcaster. We're delighted to welcome Mark to the ITV Sport team.'

ITV will show exclusive live coverage of all England's European Championship and World Cup qualifying matches and friendlies, both home and away fixtures, until 2018. ITV also holds the rights to show Champions League and Europa League matches and highlights until the end of the 2014/2015 season, after which it will show Champions League and Europa League highlights.

Mark will continue to present sports programmes for BBC Radio 5 Live and PLTV while in his ITV role.
