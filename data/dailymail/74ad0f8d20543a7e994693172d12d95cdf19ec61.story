In the early 1930s, scientists were fairly confident they understood subatomic physics.

That was until dozens of new elementary particles were discovered in the 1950s, forcing scientists to rewrite their models.

Now a new particle, first detected in 2007 but not confirmed until now, could send them back to the drawing board as they try to figure out what’s going on at a subatomic level.

Confirmation of a new 'exotic hadron' by the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb, pictured) experiment at CERN in Switzerland could require scientists to rewrite their current models of subatomic physics

This particular discovery delves into a particularly complex branch of physics.

It was made by physicists at the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) Collaboration at Cern in Geneva, Switzerland.

LHCb is a multinational experiment designed to identify new forces and particles in the universe.

The finding confirms the discovery of a so-called ‘exotic hadron.’

Atoms are usually made of protons, neutrons and electrons

These are made of even smaller elementary particles.

Elementary particles, also known as fundamental particles, are the smallest particles we know to exist.

They are subdivided into two groups, the first being fermions, which are said to be the particles that make up matter.

The second are bosons, the force particles that hold the others together.

Within the group of fermions are subatomic particles known as quarks.

When quarks combine in threes, they form compound particles known as baryons.

Protons are probably the best-known baryons.

Sometimes,
 quarks interact with corresponding anti-particles (such as 
anti-quarks), which have the same mass but opposite charges.

When this happens, they form mesons.

Mesons
 often turn up in the decay of heavy man-made particles, such as those 
in particle accelerators, nuclear reactors and cosmic rays.

Mesons, baryons, and other kinds of particles that take part in interactions like these are called hadrons.

These are types of matter that cannot be classified within the traditional quark model that is currently used.

Previously it was thought that quarks - subatomic elementary particles - could not occur in groups of more than three

This classification remained virtually unchallenged until 2007, when an international team of 400 physicists and engineers, known as the Belle Collaboration, discovered an exotic particle called Z(4430), which appeared to have two quarks and two anti-quarks.

The discovery of a particle made essentially of four quarks does not fit with our current model of physics.

Until now the discovery of Z(4430) in 2007 was highly controversial, with physicists divided on whether it could exist or not.

The recent confirmation of the particle using the LHCb proves beyond any reasonable doubt that it exists.

‘We've confirmed the unambiguous observation of a very exotic state—something that looks like a particle composed of two quarks and two anti-quarks,’ says Tomasz Skwarnicki, a specialist in experimental high-energy physics and one of the lead authors on the new paper detailing the discovery.

‘The discovery certainly doesn't fit the traditional quark model.

‘It may give us a new way of looking at strong-interaction physics.’

The discovery of a four-quark hadron was first hinted at in 2007 but it was not until recently that an international team from CERN was able to confirm the discovery beyond reasonable doubt

The Large Hadron Collider accelerator at CERN has seven particle physics detect experiments, including LHCb (pictured), that are studying physics at a subatomic level

Subatomic particles can be largely classified in two groups: Fermions, which include quarks and leptons, are those that make up matter, while bosons are said to be the 'force' particles

Quarks are elementary particles, the smallest particles we know to exist.

When they combine they form compound particles known as hadrons.

Quarks are said to have six ‘flavours’: Up, Down, Charm, Strange, Top and Bottom.

Combinations of quarks within these flavours gives rise to the ‘larger’ particles.

Groups of three quarks are known as baryons.

An example of a baryon is a proton, which is made of two 'Up' quarks and a 'Down' quark.

One of the most significant consequences of this discovery is that it may question our understanding of neutron stars.

Previously it was thought that neutron stars, as their name implies, are made solely of neutrons.

The discovery of a four-quark hadron, known as a tetraquark, challenges that theory.

Neutron stars, the remnants of supernovas, are the densest stellar objects known to exist with masses several times greater than the sun squashed into a city-sized area.

Under these extreme conditions, it could be possible for neutrons to create tetraquarks.

This would require a new classification of star known as a quark star.

In turn, this would require our current theories for the interiors of neutron stars to be re-examined.

And it may just be one consequence of this discovery.

Ultimately, our models and assumptions of subatomic physics may need to be re-evaluated.
