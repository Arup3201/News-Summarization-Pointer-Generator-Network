The heartbroken grandfather of murdered Bristol schoolgirl Becky Watts has made a music video in tribute to his beloved granddaughter, as hundreds braved the rain to march in her memory.

John Galsworthy decided to make the poignant video, in which he sings Somewhere, from the musical West Side Story, following the 16-year-old's death in February.

So far, more than 7,000 people have watched the video, which is interspersed with pictures of Becky.

The teenager vanished form her home in Crown Hill, Bristol, on February 19.

Police launched a huge search for the popular girl, which also prompted a social media campaign using the hashtag #FindBecky.

But the search ended in tragedy, when police discovered Becky's body parts at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol, on March 2, and charged her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, with murder.

Her death sparked an outpouring of grief in the community: bouquets, teddies and cards have been left at her family home, as well at Barton Court, while two online fundraising pages have also raised more than £11,000.

And today, hundreds marched through Bristol in the rain to raise even more.

The money is going to be put towards her funeral, and then towards a foundation which her family is hopes to set up in her memory, aiming to help other families in similar situations.

The walkers were joined by members of Becky's family, who wore t-shirts and badges featuring a picture of the teenager and released colourful balloons.

Touched: Becky's father said his 'young, shy, retiring' daughter would have been amazed with the turnout

Speaking after the event, Becky's father Darren Galsworthy said his daughter would have been amazed by the support.

'It's an amazing turnout, it's amazing the support they've got for my Becky who was so shy and retiring,' said Mr Galsworthy, who was supported by Becky's stepmother, Anjie, the mother of Matthews.

'Global': The Galsworthys have received messages of support from across the world after Becky (pictured) died in February

'If she could see this happening now... On a horrible day like this, hundreds and hundreds of people have turned out.

'This young, shy, reserved child who lost her life so tragically and it has hurt us all but it's touched everyone's hearts around the world.

'I've been getting messages from Australia and New Zealand, Africa, China - it's gone absolutely global.

'People recognise us, they come up to us and hug us. I've had 7 foot tall men come up to me crying, hugging me and wishing us the best.'

Grandfather John added: 'I really think she would have loved it.

'I'm sure that if she's looking down on us now that she's saying 'I am pleased, thank you'.'

Mr Galsworthy said he hoped the money would help 'keep Rebecca's name going for ever'.

Mr Galsworthy said the last month had been 'absolute hell', but he hoped to 'get our life back on track at some point'.

 The family home has been the subject of forensic searches since Becky was reported missing on February 20. 

Mr Galsworthy said: 'If we get a good vibe when we go in then we'll probably stay living there but if its too much for us to bear then we'll just sell up and move on somewhere else.' 

He added: 'It's been hell for us, I'm not going to lie. It is very difficult to keep the emotions under control.

'I have to thank the whole Bristol community for their support, it really does help us.

'I hope this ends sooner rather than later because every day has been hell for us. Every day has been an absolute nightmare.' 

Lasting tribute: Darren said he hoped a foundation in her name would help her 'go on forever'

Bereft: Becky's boyfriend Luke Oberhansli (pictured) also took part in the march

Matthews, of Warmley, South Gloucestershire, appeared at Bristol Crown Court on March 26, along with five others charged in connection with the death.

His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, of Cotton Mill Lane, Bristol, is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police.

Jaydene Parsons, 23, James Ireland, and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, are accused of helping dispose of and conceal Becky's body parts.

A plea hearing has been set for August 4, with a provisional trial date of October 5. All six defendants have been remanded in custody.
