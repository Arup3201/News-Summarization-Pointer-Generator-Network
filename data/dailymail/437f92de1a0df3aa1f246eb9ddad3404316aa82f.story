Pretty faces ... but pretty dumb.

Two male models have been busted dealing drugs in New York after allegedly selling a stash of cocaine and acid to an undercover cop.

The daughter of a former Brooklyn prosecutor was also involved in the alleged ring.

Quest models Christopher Wetmore, 25, and Joseph DeNormandie, 20, appeared in a Manhattan court Friday, The New York Post reported.
