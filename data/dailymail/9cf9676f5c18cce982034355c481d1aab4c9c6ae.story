An eBay user has been banned from selling an inch-high war games model
of Hitler on the grounds that it could be seen as Nazi propaganda.

Philip Fursman, 38, paints models from war games and sells them around the world on the popular website.

In the past he has sold other 'hate' figures including those of Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban without a problem - but when the father-of-three came to sell a tiny model of Hitler worth just £10 eBay removed it.

Stunned: Philip Fursman was amazed to receive a warning from eBay after listing a tiny Hitler figurine

And he was 'stunned' to be told that site regulations do not 'permit members to list items
that contain propaganda or memorabilia with Nazi or SS markings.'

He also received a warning that if he tried to list similar items in the future they 'may be removed and affect your account negatively".

Mr Fursman, an aerospace programmer from Chard, Somerset, said of the decision, 'I quite agree that Hitler was a horrible individual but if you look at the model there are no SS markings on him.

'If I painted him blue he could be mistaken for Blakey from 'On The Buses.

'There are still lots of Nazi branded products on eBay, and if this is their policy they should apply it more thoroughly.

'And if you are have the good guys you have to have the bad guys too. I 
don't think I have been treated fairly."

Mr Fursman bought the Hitler model four years ago from an online shop when his son 
Owen, now aged 14, was studying World War II at school.

It was made by Bolt Action Miniatures which produced a World War II range of figures including Stalin and Mussolini.

He put the model up for sale on eBay on June 13 with a £2 reserve price, and had already received nine bids before eBay removed it six days later with bidding at 
£9.

eBay told him in an email, 'We know it is frustrating to see items 
removed from the website but people are not allowed to list items that 
promote or glorify hatred, violence or racial intolerance.' 

Tiny dictator: The figurine measured just 28mm in height - and was thought to be worth around £10

Despite 
removing Mr Fursman's model from its listings, eBay continues to stock other
memorabilia including three-inch high figures of Hitler and Goering 
which are currently available and have attracted bids of up to £115.

Mr Fursman's experience is similar to that of David Davidson who was banned from 
selling a rare Dad's Army board game on eBay in January 2010 after it breached
their 'offensive material policy'.

Mr Davidson, of Droitwich, Worcs.,bought the game - suitable for 
children as young as eight - second hand from a car boot sale for just 
£1 more than 20 years ago.

He decided to sell the game on eBay with a starting price of 99p but 
received an email from the online giant telling him they were taking it 
off the site because it could 'promote violence, hatred, racial or 
religious intolerance'.

Removed from sale: But eBay continues to list other similar items of memorabilia

The company even suggested a swastika symbol on the board and on the 
front of the box constituted 'memorabilia associated with the Nazi 
Party' which breached their offensive material policy.

Mr Davidson, who came across the game while clearing out his loft, said at the time, 'Instead of making a few quid and clearing some space, I've been made to look like I'm a racist or Nazi sympathiser. I'm very annoyed.'

He accused eBay of vetting content on the site 'without looking into anything properly. They allow coins and stamps with swastikas and there are hundreds of novels which are war stories that have them. It's ridiculous that they can't use common sense'.
