A retired African circus elephant has killed an animal keeper at the zoo where she now lives, it emerged today.

Mila the 39-year-old African elephant had performed in the circus for three decades but was seeing out her retirement at Franklin Zoo in Auckland, New Zealand.

But the former circus animal is thought to have killed a zookeeper who had been caring for her at the New Zealand attraction on a day when the zoo was open to the public.

New Zealand police officers said they were called to an incident between the elephant and the keeper on Wednesday afternoon, but have so far released few further details.

It is not immediately clear how the woman died or whether any visitors to Franklin Zoo saw the incident take place.

Emergency officials said the female zookeeper was killed when she was sat on by the giant elephant.

Police said no further information about the incident would be released until the woman's family had been informed.

A fire service spokesperson said: 'The elephant had been secured and paramedics were working with the patient.'

Wednesday was a public holiday in New Zealand and the zoo was open, but officials at Franklin Zoo have so far offered no comment.

According to the zoo's website, Mila is the only elephant there, having arrived four years ago after ending her days as a circus performer.

Franklin Zoo built a new enclosure for Mila which was opened in 2010.
