Protestants are no longer America's religious majority.

New figures reveal that for the first time ever just 47 per cent of the United States identifies with the denomination.

And more than one in five citizens are religiously unaffiliated.

According to the Public Religion Research Institute, the unprecedented drop in Protestantism is down to dwindling figures of young people in churches, and a surge in white Christians becoming unaffiliated with religion.

White Evangelical Protestants: Though once the majority, this map shows the few states where the demographic is still a majority

Thirteen states are largely non-religious, which is 22 per cent of the country.

The highest figures fall in Oregon (37 per cent), New Hampshire (35 per cent), Washington State (33 per cent), and Vermont (32 per cent).

That is almost tied with the nation's Catholic population, which stands at 23 per cent.

Catholicism is most prominent in the Northeast where 34 per cent identifies with the religion. Rhode Island is home to the majority of the region's Cathoilcs, with 44 per cent.

Unaffiliated: The number of Americans who do not identify as religious is rising, particularly in the Northwest 

Catholic: Catholicism remains strong, particularly in the Northeast, with a strong group of Hispanic Catholics in the South

Though the majority of Catholics are white, Hispanic Catholics are a growing demographic. Around 49 per cent of Catholics under 29 are Hispanic.

Hindus are most likely found in Connecticut and New Jersey. The majority of Hindus are young, with an average age of 36.

Buddhists are likely found in either Delaware or California - and are most often single.
