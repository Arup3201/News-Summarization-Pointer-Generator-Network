Sean Cruise, 52, was found dead at his flat in Southampton, Hampshire (pictured) three days after carers went in and opened the curtains

A man lay dead in his home for six days after visiting carers failed to spot his body on the floor despite opening curtains next to where he was slumped.

Sean Cruise, 52, was found on the floor next to a radiator at his flat in Southampton, Hampshire, three days after carers went in and opened the curtains directly above him.

Mr Cruise’s ‘disappearance’ sparked a massive missing-persons inquiry and police spent three days hunting for him, but not at his flat.

The blunder has called into question how carers could fail to see the body, which his brother said they would have ‘tripped over’.

One of the carers who searched the flat told an inquest it was a ‘mystery’ she did not see his body.

Sue Grantham, care coordinator with NHS Southern Health’s community health team, visited the property when he had not been seen for three days.

She was joined by a care worker and a representative from the landlord last December after Mr Cruise failed to show up for a doctor’s appointment.

She told the inquest: ‘I find it very difficult to think that I was walking around the room and didn’t see him.

‘I genuinely didn’t see him. That has been a mystery to me throughout the whole thing, to think that he could have been in there and I didn’t see him.’

Police were called and launched a missing person investigation for Mr Cruise, who lived alone, Southampton Coroner’s Court was told.

Officers eventually found him slumped on the floor three days later, when they searched the flat themselves.

Tests revealed he died from a heart attack.

Mr Cruise’s brother Seamus Cruise questioned how the carers failed to see the body.

Mr Cruise, from Southampton, told the hearing: ‘Whoever drew the curtains would have tripped over the body.

‘Someone needs to be accountable so that it doesn’t happen to someone else. That is all we can ask for.’

Care bosses insisted lessons had been learned following Mr Cruise’s death.

He received regular home visits from the team and members of the Society of St James, a registered charity for the homeless, during his life.

But before he died, he refused to allow carer workers into his home for several weeks.

Hampshire deputy coroner Gordon Denson slammed health bosses for the failings in care.

Giving a determination of death by natural causes, Mr Denson said: ‘I consider that there was a considerable breakdown in the level of care that Sean should have been expected to receive during the latter part of his life.’

He added that he hoped a report compiled by Southern Health admitting failings in the incident was ‘fully implemented” so it would not happen again.

A spokesman from Southern Health NHS said: ‘As Sean became more unwell, it became more difficult to support him and our staff struggled to gain access to his flat.

‘We have investigated the way we were supporting Sean and, although we were providing regular care, a more assertive approach may have improved the level of contact we were able to achieve.’

A spokesman from Society of St James said the set-up gave Mr Cruise independence.

He said: ‘The scheme is not designed to provide daily monitoring of clients, as this reduces independence and prevents people developing independent life skills.

‘The society ensured that Mr Cruise was visited several times a week, having regular contact with staff.’

Hampshire police, who were quizzed by the coroner about why they did not immediately search Mr Cruise’s home when he was reported missing, did not comment.
