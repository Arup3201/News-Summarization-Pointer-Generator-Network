The NYPD went some way to restoring fraught community relations in Staten Island by taking part in a commemoration of sorts to Eric Garner - whose chokehold death earlier this month sparked massive condemnation of the force.

At an impromptu memorial to the 43-year-old father-of-six at the Berry Houses annual basketball tournament, a player wearing a 'R.I.P Eric Garner' T-shirt leapt over a NYPD squad car and slam-dunked the hoop to set the crowd off into a fit of celebration.

The cruiser rang out a whoop of its sirens and flashed its lights in appreciation, signaling a thawing in relations and a minor triumph for local community organizers and the NYPD who jointly organized the display.

'It was good for both sides,' said Under the Lights basketball league founder Joel Soto to the Staten Island Advance.

'The cops definitely wanted to use this as a way to get a good relationship between them and civilians, but besides that it felt real - they were just as into it as everyone else here.'

Tensions have been high across the New York City borough following the death of Garner after an officer bound him in a chokehold when he verbally refused to be arrested - accusing the police of harassing him.

The move is banned in all guideline manuals for the NYPD and in disturbing video of the incident Garner can be heard telling cops that physically cannot breathe before he lost consciousness and never woke up.

So when a NYPD squad car arrived at the courts of the Berry Houses on Friday, some held their breath while others simply booed.

However, it quickly became clear that this was not an intervention, rather the officers had come to join in.

Soto had asked the police to join the event and they had discussed before hand what kind of participation that could be.

'The cops were really great and nice about it - it was a little bit surreal,' said Soto to the Advance.

That was the cue for Brian Hogan-Gary, 20, to pull of his jersey to reveal his 'R.I.P Eric Garner' T-shirt, that had 'Justice' emlazened on the back, and line himself up for his dunk.

In a cathartic display, Hogan-Gary ran down the court and jumped clean over the car to slam the ball through the hoop and set off wild celebrations.

'People were really surprised the cops wanted to be a part of it,' said Soto to the , Advance, adding,

'It definitely brought down a little of the tension between police and the community.'

Indeed, Soto revealed that two of Garner's teenage sons are members of the league, but they declined to be at the basketball court on Friday.

'Everyone really respects Garner here and feels for him ... he was part of the Under the Lights family,' Soto said to the Advance.
