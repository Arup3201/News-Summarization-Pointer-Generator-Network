A music teacher told a school's deputy head teacher that he had killed a girl in a car accident in a bid to try and get out of going to work.

Derek McGlone, 42, fabricated the lie, telling his employers he felt his car wheels running over her body, just so that he could skip work at Calderhead High School, North Lanarkshire, where he was head of music.

After admitting the lie, the teacher said he was 'embarrassed and sorry' about his actions and insisted he still wanted to teach, saying he had a 'passion' for the profession.

'Embarrassed': Derek McGlone admitted to lying about killing a girl in car crash to get time off work

But a hearing at the General Teaching Council Scotland found his fitness to teach was impaired.

The teacher has a record for missing work after he told a deputy head that he was caught up in Iceland's ash cloud, despite being at home in Glasgow.

He had also taken to Facebook to rant about his colleagues, calling other staff 'bitches.'

The hearing heard how his former colleagues had complained that his comments were abusive and threatening.

Mr McGlone, who represented himself at the hearing, described himself as a 'respected' head of music, art and design when he made false statements about his absence between June, 9 2008 and May, 31 2011.

Mr McGlone said his behaviour was inexcusable: 'I can give no reasonable explanation for my actions.

'I make no excuse for any of the three incidents - they are unforgivable, stupid and silly.

'Please believe me, I have had enough time to think about this.'

Mr McGlone admitted three charges brought by the GTCS, including making threatening and abusive comments towards former teaching colleagues on Facebook.

The former teacher said he had taken to Facebook in April 2011 in a 'drunken rant' after discovering former colleagues had made statements about him to the GTCS.

He said he was 'dumbfounded and horrified' when he read other members' of staff's statements and he was embarrassed his comments were seen as threatening.

'I do not consider myself to be a threatening person - people would laugh if they heard me described as threatening

'I do admit wholeheartedly the case against me and I have been previously of good character, nothing of these matters will happen again.'

Mr McGlone said he tried to carve a living by getting involved in touring productions of Evita and Scrooge since he resigned as a teacher in 2011.

He said: 'I have always had a passion to teach. I have tried to make a living doing other things but there is nothing that compares to teaching.'

GTCS solicitor Niall McLean read out a statement from deputy head teacher at Calderhead High, Joyce Kilmartin.

She said there was a 'number of occasions' Mr McGlone had told lies in order to take days off work.

Her statement added: 'He started off telling a few silly lies.

'He then lied about knocking a girl over and killing her - he said he felt his car wheels running over her body.'

The hearing panel, presided over by John Kilpatrick, concluded: 'The Panel determined that the Respondent's conduct falls short of the standards expected of a registered teacher and that his fitness to teach is therefore impaired.'

The Panel considered that making no order or removing the Respondent's name from the Register would be disproportionate to the seriousness of the complaints.

'In the whole circumstances of the case, and in view of the representations made by the Presenting Officer and the Respondent, the Panel considered that the appropriate outcome in this case is that a reprimand be recorded in the Register against the Respondent's name for a period of twelve months from the date of expiry of the appeal period specified in the Rules.'

A reprimand has been recorded in the teaching register against Mr McGlone's name for 12 months.
