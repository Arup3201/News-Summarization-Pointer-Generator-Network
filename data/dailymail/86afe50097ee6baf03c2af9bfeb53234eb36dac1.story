A disgusted mother opened a jar of baby food for her eight-month-old son and found it covered in green mould.

Laura Rees, 31, had stocked up on ten 89p jars of HiPP baby food at her local Tesco branch to feed her toddler Lennon.

But a week later she took the lid off one of the organic Parsnip, Potato and Turkey Casseroles and was greeted with a patch of mould on the food.

Mrs Rees has been offered a refund and an apology by Tesco and is now sending the rogue jar to the manufacturers to investigate.

Sickened: Laura Rees with the mouldy baby food from HiPP Organic and her toddler Lennon

She said: 'I was nearly sick because of the smell. It's so scary.

'We go out of our way to spend extra money for organic food and you put your trust in these companies to give you the good nutrients your baby needs.

'If it was adult food it's unacceptable but it's worse because it is baby food.

'Tesco can only do so much because you can't see it from the outside so I'm blaming the manufacturers for their quality control because it should not have happened.

'I want them to accept they have done something wrong and to make sure their quality control is more watertight so it doesn't happen again.'

Mrs Rees bought the food from a Tesco near her home in Leighton Buzzard, Bedforshire, and it was within its sell-by-date.

Grim find: The mouldy baby food from HiPP Organic'Â­s

A spokesman for the manufacturers said the jar must have lost its air vacuum and let oxygen get in and form a mould on the food.

They said: 'At HiPP we take huge pride in our quality control procedures and therefore take complaints of this nature extremely seriously.

'Mould can only ever grow in the presence of oxygen, which would suggest that this jar had lost vacuum prior to the opening of it.

'We do believe that HiPP baby foods are produced to the most rigorous standards within the industry, and after the heat treatment process is completed to preserve the baby food, there is no possibility of mould entering the product unless the jar loses vacuum.

'We have spoken to Ms Rees who has agreed to send us the sample of the product in question and explained that upon receiving the product we will start a full internal investigation to try and determine why the vacuum seal on this jar has failed and send her a full report of our findings.

'We can confirm that we have not received any other complaints on this product.'

Tesco said: 'We expect all the branded products we sell to meet our high standards and we were concerned to learn of this issue.

'Our Customer Service Team has asked Mrs Rees for further details and to return the product so that we can thoroughly investigate with the brand supplier to see what might have happened.

'We will of course be keeping Mrs Rees updated with the findings.'
