Radio 4 chiefs face accusations of ‘trivialising’ abortion after asking fans of The  Archers to vote on whether a character expecting a Down’s syndrome baby should terminate the pregnancy.

The BBC soap currently features the moving story of an older couple dealing with the news that their unborn child has the condition. 

In the show, Vicky Tucker, who is in her mid-forties and pregnant for the first time, is adamant that she wants to go ahead and have the baby.

The Archers fans were asked to vote on whether Rachel Atkins' (right) character - expecting a Down's syndrome baby - should terminate the pregnancy that her husband on the show, played by Terry Molloy (left), does not want

But her husband Mike, a sixtysomething dairy farmer, feels it will be too much for them to cope with.

Some listeners have been in tears at the harrowing storyline and there has been praise for the sensitive way it has been handled.

But fans who logged on to The Archers website recently were taken aback to find a poll inviting a yes/no vote on whether the Vicky character should have an abortion.

The online vote was posted on the website on September 3 and remained in place for several days.

Critics claimed its blunt approach trivialised what is a ‘life-changing decision’ for many couples and was presented in a ‘tasteless’ way.

In the show, 62-year-old Mike, played by Terry Molloy, is distraught that his wife, played by Rachel Atkins, appears to have made up her mind to go ahead with the pregnancy without considering his views.

Fans of the show have speculated whether the trauma could end their marriage. Listeners upset at the poll wrote of their concerns online and some had called for it to removed.

One fan wrote: ‘Could we please get the distasteful poll on The Archers website removed?’

Another said: ‘Discussion on Archers website is really interesting and thought provoking. A simple “yes/no” poll just feels a bit wrong.’

Jane Fisher, from Antenatal Results and Choices, a national charity which supports expectant and bereaved parents, said yesterday: ‘It’s a hugely painful personal decision to which different parents and couples bring different things.

‘I think to reduce it to a simple yes/no vote can be seen to trivialise what is a life-changing decision.

‘There is no easy answer in these circumstances and we don’t think the BBC should promote the idea that the outcome of a difficult and painful decision should be based on the number of votes received by the public.’  

In a letter to a national newspaper, Archers listener Karen Day-Milne wrote: ‘It is understandable that  the BBC should wish to explore this controversial plot line in the  show, and indeed the story is being handled with some sensitivity; yet to ask listeners to vote yes or no to the ending of an albeit fictional life seems tasteless.’ 

Last night a spokesman for the programme apologised and admitted the poll was ill-judged.

‘The storyline has been well-received by the audience and raises a number of important issues,’ the spokesman said.

‘However this issue is too complex and sensitive for an online poll and we regret any offence the poll may have caused.’
