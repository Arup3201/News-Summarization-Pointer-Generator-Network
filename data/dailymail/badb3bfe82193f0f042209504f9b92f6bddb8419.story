Paula Radcliffe has revealed her heartache at people challenging the legitimacy of her world marathon record.

Her time of 2hrs 15mins and 25secs has stood since 2003, but the spectre of doping means even clean athletes are suspected of drug taking, according to Radcliffe.

‘It’s horrible,’ said the 41-year-old. ‘I get it all the time. People saying “she couldn’t have run 2.15 clean” but I know I can be totally proud.

‘I can’t understand how other people who have cheated can stand there and look their competitors and family in the eye. On the one hand you can say “people can say what they want because I know inside” but still, it’s not nice to have people saying that.’

Russian Liliya Shobukhova, the second fastest female marathon runner, was banned for two years for doping while Kenyan Rita Jeptoo, the fifth fastest, is awaiting the outcome of a hearing into her positive doping test.

In addition, revelations in a German TV documentary last month claimed 99 per cent of Russian athletes were drugs cheats and revealed that one famous British athlete was among more than hundreds of track and field stars who had suspicious blood values that were covered up.

Radcliffe admitted she was angry that these claims mean her legacy, which includes the three fastest times in the history of the women’s marathon, is doubted.

‘It makes you think we have to put a system in place that protects clean athletes,’ said Radcliffe. ‘There will be some Russians athletes who are not cheating, there are a lot of Kenyan athletes out there who are not cheating and they are all being lumped together. It spoils it so we have to do something to protect them and the sport.’

Radcliffe called for the entire Russian team to be banned from international competition following the German documentary.

‘You knew that there was some kind of problem going on there but the scale and level of it was a shock,’ she said. ‘You have to be careful because it hasn’t been proven yet but that level of corruption was shocking.

‘The world anti-doping agency says it is going to look into it by the end of the year. I appreciate that it takes time to conduct an investigation but I think it has to be done fast.’

Radcliffe is supporting Lord Coe in his bid to become president of the IAAF and said she would like to be more involved in the fight against doping.

Radcliffe was speaking to launch a scheme to encourage ordinary women to take part in the Great Manchester Run on May 10. She will soon leave for three weeks’ training in Kenya to prepare for this year’s London Marathon, which is likely to bring down the curtain on her career.

Meanwhile, five Russian race walkers, including three Olympic champions, have been handed doping bans.

Great Run has appointed Paula Radcliffe as its ambassador for women’s running. If you want to be one of ‘Radcliffe’s Great Runners’ and enter the Great Manchester Run visit www.greatrun.org/Manchester.
