Just when will the new royal baby be born? Today, the Duchess of Cambridge revealed that her due date is just over a month away as she visited a charity for children and their families today.

Touring the Brookhill Children's Centre in Woolwich, Kate, who was wearing a £35 maternity dress by ASOS, was asked about the impending royal birth by volunteer, Christine Osborne, 49. 

'I’m due mid-April, to the end of April,' confessed the 33-year-old royal mother-to-be, adding: 'Not long to go now.' 'I couldn’t resist asking,’ Christine, a grandmother who has worked for the charity for seven years, said afterwards. ‘It’s very exciting – and was wonderful to have her here.’

Babies were very much the order of the day for the Duchess, who was in Woolwich to meet volunteers helping out at Home-Start, a charity that helps more than 29,000 families a year.

Its 15,000 volunteers visit clients in their homes, helping parents struggling to cope with issues such as isolation, mental ill health, bereavement, multiple births, illness or disability - many of which have a direct effect on their children.

The Duchess declined a biscuit but listened intently as Rob Parkinson, CEO of Home-Start UK, outlined the work they did. Then it was on to meet some of the families who have received often life-changing help from the charity including Charlene Roper, 25 and her partner Graham Wilders Jnr, 32, who were with their impeccably behaved three-month-old daughter Francesca, the youngest of their three children.

Kate also commiserated with some of the mothers at the coffee morning about sleeping patterns and feeding routines. ‘It can be hard, can’t it,’ she said sympathetically. ‘So often it’s about giving you the confidence to interact with your baby.’

She also spoke with a group of mothers, who did not wish to be identified, who had suffered with post natal depression. ‘The Duchess made clear in advance of the visit that she was keen to speak to them as post-natal depression can have such a knock-on effect on every aspect of family life,’ explained head of communications Annie O’Brian.

Before leaving the royal mother-to-be was given a bag with some useful gifts: a potty training for boys book, a manual on how to teach children to tie their shoelaces, a toy sorter and an Elmer the elephant book.

‘Oh that’s perfect,’ she laughed, looking at the potty training manual with a view to her son, Prince George, will turn two in July, ‘We will certainly be needing that!’

As she left the engagement - likely to be one of her last public appearances before she gives birth - the Duchess thanked staff and told them: ‘I can now see how the work you does makes such a difference to all these families. It is remarkable.’

Home-Start CEO Rob Parkinson said afterwards that he was delighted at how the visit had gone. ‘It doesn’t matter where you come from, when you are a mother there is a commonality there – something that the Duchess saw for herself today,’ he said.

‘She was brilliant in the way she chatted with the other mothers and seemed genuinely interested to learn more about our work. I think she left with a very good idea of what Home-Start is all about.’ 

Busy schedule: The visit is the Duchess' second in as many days and is part of her work as a champion for underprivileged families

Kate, although eight months pregnant, has had a notably busy schedule of late and spent yesterday presenting sprigs of shamrock to the 1st Battalion, the Irish Guards.

With husband Prince William, the Duchess watched as 200 soldiers from the regiment completed their traditional St. Patrick's Day parade in the square at the Mons Barracks in Aldershot.

But while the Duke of Cambridge opted to get into the spirit of things at the reception afterwards and enjoyed a pint of Guinness, the Duchess, who had earlier struggled to attach a shamrock posy to the collar of Irish wolfhound Domhnall, sensibly stuck to water. 

While the Duchess of Cambridge was visiting children in Woolwich, Prince William at Buckingham Palace where he took part in a series of official audiences with the Queen.

In what will be seen as a sign of the Duke's increasingly central role within the Royal Family, William joined his grandmother as she accepted the letters patent from the new Austrian and Nicaraguan ambassadors.

Meeting ambassadors is a key part of the sovereign's role, with foreign representatives expected to visit the Queen to present their credentials when they arrive in the UK.

Those returning home are also expected to call on the monarch and present her with their official letters of recall before leaving.

While this is the first time that the Duke has joined the Queen for audiences, he has already begun to conduct investiture ceremonies, a role only performed by the monarch or direct heirs.

Most memorable of his investitures so far was one that took place last month, in which he presented Dragon's Den star James Caan with a CBE and admitted to being a fan of the BBC show. 

Volunteering: The visit to Home-Start comes after she visited a similar charity, Action for Children during a visit to Stoke-on-Trent last month
