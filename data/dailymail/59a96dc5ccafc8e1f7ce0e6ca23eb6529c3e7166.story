Sony has announced that its PlayStation Network is back online after a three-day hack-attack, but millions of users are still experiencing problems.

On Monday morning, the service suffered connection problems for the fourth day in a row following the attack, allegedly by a hacker activist group known as Lizard Squad.

PlayStation Network, which has 110million accounts worldwide was attacked by the group, which also targeted Microsoft Corp's Xbox Live, on Christmas Day.

Under attack: Sony's PlayStation Network, which has 110million user accounts, was still suffering connection problems on Monday, four days after the initial hacker attack

'We are currently experiencing widespread network issues that are being addressed,' Sony said in a statement on PlayStation's maintenance website.

In a blog post Saturday night saying service had been restored, Sony vice president Catherine Jensen added that 'PlayStation Network and some other gaming services were attacked over the holidays with artificially high levels of traffic to disrupt connectivity and online gameplay.'

Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which also went down Thursday, was back online Friday for its 40million subscribers, although the company reported continuing problems.   

Some gamers said on Twitter that they were able to access the PlayStation Network on Sunday, but others took to the microblogging site to complain about the continuing outage.

It was not immediately clear how many of the 110 million PSN users who were still suffering problems Monday morning.

Sony has admitted to still experiencing problems, taking to Twitter to say that services are 'gradually coming back online' after the Christmas Day hack-attack by Lizard Squad

On Sony's Twitter customer support account, AskPlayStation, a representative wrote, 'Network services are gradually coming back online.'

Sony has been the victim of some of the most high-profile security breaches in history.

In late November, Sony Pictures' computer system was taken down by hackers protesting the film, 'The Interview,' which depicts the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.   

Hackers released several upcoming Sony movies as well as personal details of thousands of employees and the various aliases used by celebrities when they book into hotels to protect their anonymity.

Dozens of highly embarrassing emails were made available to the public - including one which described Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'.

Sony initially decided not to release The Interview but relented just before Christmas, and the film, co-written, co-produced and co-starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, made $15million in online rentals over the weekend, as well as $2.8million from theatres.

Lizard Squad has claimed responsibility for attacks on the PlayStation Network in early December and August of this year. 

The August attack coincided with a bomb scare in which Lizard Squad tweeted to American Airlines that it heard explosives were on board a plane carrying an executive with Sony Online Entertainment.

In 2011, hackers stole data belonging to 77 million PlayStation Network users.
