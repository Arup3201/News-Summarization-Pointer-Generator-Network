Frustration: The letter complained about the attention the author had gained from his books

A letter by Alice in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll complaining about the fame sparked by his classic children's books has been auctioned for almost £12,000.

Writing from Oxford's Christ Church college in 1891, the notoriously reclusive author told a friend: 'Sometimes I almost wish I had never written any books at all.'

An anonymous bidder bought the letter for £11,875 - three times its estimate - while a photograph Carroll took of a young girl with a bucket and spade in Eastbourne in 1882 fetched £5,250.

Carroll, whose real name was Charles 
Dodgson, wrote the three-page letter to a friend he addressed as Mrs Symonds almost 30 years after first achieving fame for his Alice books.

The author said he resented giving his 
autograph and hated people finding out his real name.

He wrote: 'Dear Mrs Symonds, I don't think I 
explained successfully my reasons for disliking letters of mine being 
put into autograph-collections.

'All
 that sort of publicity leads to strangers [underlined] hearing of my real name in connection with the books, and to my
 being pointed out to, and stared at by, strangers, and treated as a "lion".

'And I hate all that so intensely that sometimes I almost wish I
 had never written any books at all.'

He said he realised 
plenty of people 'like being looked at as a notoriety' and could not understand why he used a pen-name and craved anonymity.

But he went on: 'We are not all made on the same pattern: & our likes & dislikes are very different'.

The writer, who was notoriously shy with people he did not know and suffered from a stammer, loathed anyone knowing about his private life and never gave interviews.

He guarded his real identity so 
carefully that in 1890 he went as far as to produce a printed notice 
known as the 'Stranger circular'.

When he received letters addressed to C. L. Dodgson, talking about Lewis Carroll, he returned them with a copy of the notice.

It
read: 'Mr Dodgson...neither claims nor acknowledges any 
connection with any pseudonym or with any book not published under his 
own name'.

The letter was written from Christ 
Church, where Carroll was a mathematics don, on 9 November 1891 and he used dark grey ink rather than his usual 
distinctive violet.

It sold at Bonhams in central London after a bidding frenzy. The auction house had predicted worldwide interest from collectors of Alice in Wonderland memorabilia.

Revealing: The back page of the letter said he was different from those who craved publicity

It comes after another letter by 
Carroll emerged in 2008, cryptically answering modern-day speculation as
 to whether he was a paedophile.

Written to the muse for Alice in Wonderland, Alice Liddell, it read: 'Thank you for the sight of the pretty photographs, but don't keep the child in for me - I am fearfully busy - and what could [Carroll's contemporary] Miss Lloyd have been thinking of to say such things of me?

'She must have taken some remark of mine about liking children and have said to herself for "some" read "all", for "girls" read "boys" and for "ten" read "two"  -  such a method of exaggeration is wholly unfounded.'

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, depicting the journey of a young girl through a fantasy world, was published under the pen name Lewis Carroll in 1865 by Macmillan and Co.

Rarities: The auction also contained an unpublished letter from JRR Tolkien to his publishers discussing the difficulties of completing Return of the King, the third part of his famous Lord of the Rings trilogy

The author's own illustrations were replaced by those of John Tenniel, a more accomplished artist already famous for his work on Punch magazine.

The phenomenal success of the stories was followed in 1871 by his sequel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There.

Even Queen Victoria wrote personally to the author saying how much she enjoyed his work.

Carroll died shortly before his 66th birthday in 1898 from pneumonia.

By the time of his death, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland had become the most popular children's book in England. By 1932, it was one of the most popular in the world.
