Sam Burgess has been told he risked serious eye damage by playing for nearly 80 minutes with a double facial fracture in Sunday’s NRL Grand Final and could have jeopardised his chances of featuring in the rugby union World Cup.

The Bath-bound player — hailed a ‘modern-day gladiator’ for refusing to leave the field following a sickening clash of heads with an opponent — had surgery in Sydney on Tuesday, when he had a metal plate inserted into his face to repair a fractured cheekbone and eye socket.

His recovery is expected to take ‘several months’, which will leave him less than nine months from his first game of professional rugby union until the start of next year’s World Cup.

On Tuesday night, Burgess’s courage was called into question by former rugby-league great Dr George Peponis, who is now a GP.

‘He was courageous because he stayed on with a fractured eye socket or cheekbone, whatever it was,’ Peponis said.

‘However, if he got another bad knock on that eye socket it could’ve done some more serious damage, it could’ve been further depressed and caused some damage to his muscles around the eye. Thankfully, luckily, none of that happened.’

South Sydney Rabbitohs owner, film star Russell Crowe, said Burgess’s heroism had seen him carve his name ‘deep into rugby league history’ following his man-of-the-match display in his final game for the Sydney club.

But England head coach Stuart Lancaster, and his Bath counterpart Mike Ford, will be more concerned with the 25-year-old missing a large part of the Aviva Premiership following a deal to bring him to union worth close to £500,000.

Lancaster is facing an increasingly lengthy injury list which has already seen four players ruled out of the autumn internationals while there is growing concern that Tom Croft’s knee problem could be worse than the club are prepared to admit.
