Missing student Holly Bobo was filmed tied up and crying before her suspected murderer raped her, according to a witness who claims she saw the footage.

Sandra King testified at a preliminary hearing on Tuesday that Jeffrey Pearcy, who has been charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence, showed her the cell phone video.

After King's testimony at the court in Lexington, Kentucky, the case against Pearcy was sent to the grand jury as the judge deemed there to be enough evidence against him, WMC reported

King said that Pearcy showed her the video and that Zachary Adams, who has been charged with murdering and kidnapping the 20-year-old in 2011, was also in the footage.

Revelations: Witness Sandra King testified at a preliminary hearing on Tuesday that she saw missing student Holly Bobo tied up and crying in cell phone footage shown to her by Jeffrey Pearcy

'I seen a woman that was tied up that was crying,' King told the court. 'She was blonde... It looked like Holly Bobo.'

She said that Pearcy told her his brother Mark Pearcy - who has also been charged in the case - had taken the video of Adams raping the student, USA Today reported.

King said she did not see the sexual assault.

'I knew what he was fixing to do. I did not want to see,' King said.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has also not seen the video. Jeffrey Pearcy has denied the video exists and agents are now trying to find out if it is on his cell phone.

But King testified that they had worked with her to trick Pearcy in to acknowledging the existence of the video on a phone call.

Where is she? Holly Bobo, 20, vanished from her home in 2011 but her body has never been found

'I
 said to him, "You know that video of Holly, if it would have been you 
in that video, I would have watched it," and he said, "Yes I know",' 
King said.

Speaking outside the court after the hearing, Pearcy said he couldn't hear what King was saying over the phone because he was driving with the windows down.

He has previously claimed he never met Holly, doesn't know her family and hasn't met the two men charged with her kidnapping and murder, Zach Adams and Jason Autry.

His brother Mark faces the same charges and is awaiting a preliminary hearing.

He was also
 charged with failing to register as a sex offender and unlawful 
possession of a weapon. According to online records, Mark Pearcy 
registered as a sex offender in 2000 for statutory rape.

Both men have pleaded not guilty. Tampering with evidence is a Class C Felony and accessory after the fact is a Class E Felony.

Denial: Pearcy, pictured outside court on Tuesday, has been charged with with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence for the video - but he denies such footage exists

Charged: Zachary Adams, left, and Jason Wayne Autry, right, are suspected of kidnapping and killing Bobo

Bobo was abducted from outside her home in Darden on the morning of April 13, 2011. Her brother told investigators he saw a man in camouflage walking her into the woods.

Adams was indicted in March on charges of especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder.

Another man, Adams' longtime friend Jason Wayne Autry, was indicted in April on first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping charges.

TBI director Mark Gwyn previously said the agency has sworn statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing.

Her body has never been found.
