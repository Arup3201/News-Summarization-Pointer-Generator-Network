Speaking out: Niall Ferguson described the First World War as 'the biggest error in modern history'

The political row over the First World War has intensified after one of Britain's best-known historians declared that the conflict was 'the biggest error in modern history'.

Harvard professor Niall Ferguson argues that Britain should never have entered the war against Germany, saying that 'the cost was catastrophic' and it was not worth the millions of lives lost.

He is the latest historian to weigh in on the origins of the war after Michael Gove took aim at 'Left-wing academics' who have perpetuated a view of the conflict as an unmitigated disaster.

The Education Secretary blamed experts for the picture of the First World War put forward in popular culture such as Blackadder, which focuses on the casualties of battle and the blunders made by aristocratic officers.

He faced a backlash from some eminent historians, as well as his Labour opposite number Tristram Hunt - but Mr Ferguson is the first figure from the Right to speak out against his views.

In an interview with BBC History magazine, the Scottish professor and author said: 'Britain could indeed have lived with a German victory. What's more, it would have been in Britain's interests to stay out in 1914.'

Mr Gove wrote in the Mail that the First World War was a 'just war', essential for 'defending the western liberal order' by constraining the imperial ambitions of Germany and Austria-Hungary.

But Mr Ferguson, 49 - who is presenting a BBC2 series based on his 1998 book The Pity of War - disputed this judgement, saying that sending millions of troops to the continent was unnecessary to defend Britain's interests.

'Britain could indeed have lived with a German victory,' he said. 'What's more, it would have been in Britain's interests to stay out in 1914.

'A better strategy would have been to wait and deal with the German challenge later, when Britain could respond on its own terms.'

'Even if Germany had defeated France and Russia, it would have had a pretty massive challenge on its hands trying to run the new German-dominated Europe and would have remained significantly weaker than the British Empire in naval and financial terms.'

Under fire: Education Secretary Michael Gove is embroiled in a political row about the war's origins

It
 was on the 28 July 1914 that artillery units of Austria-Hungary began 
to rain down shells on Belgrade, the Serbian capital - the very first 
shots of the First World War.

That
 attack was to start a chain reaction that, within weeks, embroiled all 
of the world's great powers into a global war which mobilised more than 
70million military personnel. The Great War - as it was soon to be known
 - was the first military conflict to be fought on an industrial scale.

But
 the technological advances that led to increases in the lethality of 
weapons were not matched by changes in strategy, with both sides 
resorting to practically suicidal human wave attacks.

Although
 much of the warfare took place in Europe, battle was soon joined across
 the planet via the colonies of the European imperial powers.

By
 1918, the powers of Central Europe were exhausted by fighting. A final 
last-ditch offensive along the Western Front by Germany was successfully
repelled and, as U.S. forces began to enter the trenches, the Allies 
staged a series of successful advances, forcing the enemy to surrender on November 11.

Mr Ferguson - who is Tisch Professor 
of History at Harvard and a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford - continued:
 'The cost of the First World War to Britain was catastrophic, and it 
left the British empire at the end of it all in a much weakened state.

'Arguments
 about honour, of course, resonate today, as they resonated in 1914 but 
you can pay too high a price for upholding that notion of honour, and I 
think in the end Britain did.'

Some have argued that Britain had a moral obligation to join the war because of its treaty with Belgium, which was invaded by Germany, but the historian dismissed this idea.

'Realism in foreign policy has a long and distinguished tradition, not least in Britain - otherwise the French would never complain about "perfidious Albion",' he said.

'For Britain it would ultimately have been far better to have thought in terms of the national interest rather than in terms of a dated treaty.'

Mr Ferguson concluded: 'We should not think of this as some great victory or dreadful crime, but more as the biggest error in modern history.'

He has previously been seen as an ally of Mr Gove, having advised the minister on the new history syllabus and spoken out in support of his educational reforms.

But his intervention in the First World War debate puts him on the side of figures such as Cambridge professor Sir Richard J. Evans, who described the Education Secretary as 'a donkey who pretends to be a lion' and accused him of historical ignorance.

After Mr Ferguson's interview was released, other historians stuck up for Mr Gove's point of view and insisted that the war was justified.

Gary Sheffield, professor of war studies at the University of Wolverhampton, wrote on Twitter: 'Contrary to Niall Ferguson's views, for Britain to have stayed out of First World War would have disastrous for Britain and Europe.'
