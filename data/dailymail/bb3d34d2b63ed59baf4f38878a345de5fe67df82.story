A Melbourne woman was left 'emotionally distraught' after being verbally and physically assaulted during a racial tirade by a fellow train passenger.

The 26-year-old victim was standing by the doors of the train as it approached Batman Railway Station in Northern Melbourne on Thursday evening, when she was approached by another woman who began hurling abuse at her. 

Media reports allege the victim was a Muslim woman.

Victorian police said the offender made a number of racial remarks before assaulting the woman. 

'The unknown woman then grabbed the victim by the neck and hair and pushed her head into the wall of the carriage a number of times,' a spokesperson said.

'The offender then pushed the victim off the train as it stopped at the station.'

Two men also left the train after the victim and assisted her, while the offender is believed to have remained on the departing carriage.

Police are appealing to the public for more information on the offender and are currently still reviewing CCTV footage.

Senior Constable Michael Potter refrained from identifying the race or religion of the victim during a press conference so as not to cause further racial vilification.

Police have revealed that the offender was of Caucasian appearance, approximately 177cm tall, solid build with short brown hair and light-coloured eyebrows.She was wearing baggy jeans, a puffy black hooded top and runners.

The racial abuse has come to light only a few days after Victorian Chief Commissioner Ken Lay encouraged the Muslim community to report any racism they experience following the death of teenager Numan Haider who stabbed two police officers last week.

'When I look at the police data it is showing little to no increase in prejudice-related crime or racial vilification, but from what I've been told there are a number of issues happening out there in the community that are not being reported to the police,' Mr Lay said at a press conference, according to The Age.

'Muslim women are being addressed in the street and insulted about their garb, there are some threats being made to police, these are issues we need to see and understand... They're not huge numbers but even if there's one we need to get it, we need to understand it... Members of faith communities need to have the confidence to bring it to police.' 

Anyone with information on the incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential report at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au
