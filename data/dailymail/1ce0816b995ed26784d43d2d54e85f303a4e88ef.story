Arsenal are not as good as Borussia Dortmund, according to Anderlecht midfielder Steven Defour.

Arsene Wenger's side were given a Champions League scare on Wednesday night as they needed two late goals from Kieran Gibbs and Lukas Podolski to beat the Belgian champions 2-1.

And Defour said after the match that the Gunners were too reliant on individual moments of brilliance to break down the Anderlecht defence, unlike the more cohesive Dortmund.

'Arsenal were hoping for a moment of brilliance from Alexis Sanchez or Danny Welbeck and didn't have many runners from midfield. Dortmund's midfielders seemed to be coming from everywhere three weeks ago,' Defour told Goal.

'Three weeks ago, Dortmund outplayed us and we have to accept they were the better team, but I don't think Arsenal were stronger than we were.'

'But I think we were better organised this time around than against Dortmund as well. We deliberately sat deep because we knew we were facing a good team.

'They can play some great football, so we needed that bit of extra certainty. We wanted to hit them on the counterattack and I think we did well.'

The win, which was the perfect present on Arsene Wenger's 65th birthday, leaves Arsenal perfectly placed to qualify for the knockout stages as they occupy second spot behind group leaders Dortmund.
