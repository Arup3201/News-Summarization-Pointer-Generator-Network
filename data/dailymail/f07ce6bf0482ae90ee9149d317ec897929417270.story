Controversial Toronto mayor Rob Ford said his Oscar-weekend trip to Hollywood was intended to raise money for his local film industry, even though the city's Film Commissioner has denied all knowledge.

Randy McLean said he 'was not involved' in the trip, which saw renowned chat show host Jimmy Kimmel dress as a limousine driver to pick Rob Ford up at an airport in Los Angeles on Saturday.

Mr McLean described himself as 'pretty confident' that the eccentric mayor, who has admitted smoking crack cocaine in the past, did not contact the Los Angeles agent Toronto uses to promote its burgeoning film industry in Hollywood, suggesting Ford may have made the decision on his own.

Prior to his journey, Ford, 44, had been boasting to the Canadian media that he would be attending the Oscars but was unable to get seats to the ceremony itself due to security and ticketing issues relating to the last-minute nature of his visit.

A CNN film crew who spotted Ford wandering along Hollywood Boulevard looking for Canadians on the Walk of Fame was told: 'We are Hollywood North and we have a great city and we want people to come and visit our city and make movies and see the great theaters and restaurants we have and sporting venues and, you know, we have a responsible government there too.'

Ford was accompanied on his journey by his driver and personal trainer Jerry Agyemang, communications director Amin Massoudi, chief of staff Dan Jacobs, brother Councillor Doug Ford and another brother Randy Ford, who holds no political position.

Despite the apparent business-led nature of his visit, officials back in Toronto expressed surprise over the reasons Ford claimed to be in the Hollywood.

Councillor Michael Thompson, chair of the Economic Development Committee which looks monitors and makes recommendations on Toronto's economy, told The Globe and Mail: 'No, he didn’t speak to me about this'.

'I wish him well. Hopefully, he’s able to present himself well and acts in a fashion that promotes the city,' Mr Thompson added.

Mr McLean told the newspaper: 'I was not involved.'

The mayor is a favourite target of Mr Kimmel’s jokes.

One of his skits features a song titled The Ballad of Rob Ford featuring the lyric: 'I'll do whatever I want to / Because I’m the drunk-driving, crack-smoking Mayor of Toronto.'

Ford's trip to Hollywood comes in the same week he took to his YouTube channel to complain about being labelled a 'celebrity'.

The ambitious Progressive Conservative politician became an international figure of fun after a video emerged of him smoking crack with a gang in Toronto.

He has since been caught in numerous controversies, ranging from being caught drink-driving, to impersonating a Jamaican in a fast-food restaurant, disappearing into a bar toilet cubicle for an hour only to emerge speaking in nonsensical sentences, making drunken violent threats, and jaywalking.

Despite calls for his resignation, he has steadfastly refused to leave office, and at Los Angeles airport even claimed he would run for re-election later this year.

When asked by Matt Lauer on NBC's The Today Show if he was still effective in his role as mayor, Ford replied: 'Absolutely. We had a major ice storm and I led the charge in getting power back on.'

'There has been the lowest tax increase in years, saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars... we're building subways. We're on fire.'
