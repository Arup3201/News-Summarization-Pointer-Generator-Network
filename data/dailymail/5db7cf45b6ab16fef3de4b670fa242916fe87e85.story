General Sir Peter Wall, head of the Army, warned further savings would damage 'our chances of success on the battlefields'

Britain's chances of winning future wars will be ‘seriously damaged’ by more crippling spending cuts, the country’s top soldier has warned.

General Sir Peter Wall, the head of the Army, said further savings likely to be ordered by the Government could prove ‘quite dangerous, quite soon’.

Under current plans, the size of the Army is being reduced from 102,000 three years ago to 82,000 – small enough for every soldier to fit inside Wembley Stadium.

The latest raft of around 5,000 
redundancies will be confirmed on Tuesday, shrinking the number of 
personnel to 90,000 – its lowest level since before the Napoleonic Wars 
began 200 years ago.

But the Ministry of Defence is expected to be ordered by the Treasury to make further cuts of at least £1billion.

Last night General Wall raised concerns about demanding more savings of the Armed Forces.

He
 said: ‘Imposing more on us now before the last round of efficiencies 
have really materialised properly in a balanced way would be very 
disruptive.

‘We have got to
 the point in certain areas where we can’t go any further without 
seriously damaging our professional competence and our chances of 
success on the battlefields of the future.’

He told Sky’s Jeff Randall that further cuts would leave the Army ‘close’ to dysfunctional.

Former commanders have warned the 
controversial cuts are too deep, leaving the Army perilously 
overstretched and unable to take on all the major military commitments 
demanded by ministers.

Some 5,000 personnel each from the RAF and Navy have already been made redundant.

The Government wants to reshape the Army, replacing regular troops by doubling the number of part-time soldiers to 30,000.

Top
 brass have also been forced to sacrifice aircraft carriers, fast jets 
and armoured vehicles to save £4.7billion and meet a £38billion 
overspend in the equipment budget.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said
 the financial bombardment from Chancellor George Osborne would damage 
our defence capability.

He said: 'Simply trying to salami slice across all areas is likely to lead to the worst possible outcome.

'If we have to make further reductions, I would rather identify specific
 areas and capabilities that we will agree to gap for a period of time 
and accept and manage the risks that are involved.'

Lieutenant General Nick Carter, the most senior British soldier in Afghanistan and the architect of the blueprint to shake up the Army by 2020, said the responsibility for any weakening of the UK’s defence should lie with the Treasury.

He said: 'At the end of the day our politicians need to decide what they want the Army to do.

'If they determine that the Army is going to do less, it's reasonable for them to reduce it still further.

'We are bound as military people to point out the risks during the 
course of this to our political masters and ultimately it's down to them
 to look themselves in the mirror each morning and determine whether or 
not those risks are manageable.'
