One of Clevenger's warrants
 is for rape, and the other for engaging children in sexually explicit 
conduct for use in a visual or print medium, reports TMZ.

‘The
 boy told police the sexual assaults happened at least three times, once
 on the sofa inside Clevenger’s home and twice inside her vehicle,’ 
according to the arrest affidavit reported by Arkansas Matters.

The victim is described in the affidavit as a ‘13-year-old white male’.

The
 boy claims that Clevenger remove his pants, climbed on top of him and 
had sex with him at her home. He claims he ejaculated in her mouth.

The
 boy also claims he had oral sex with Clevenger in her car on two 
occasions and they texted sexually explicit pics to each other.

The parents saw the pics and called authorities on November 27. The Sherwood Police Department says it was notified of the allegations against Clevenger via the Arkanas Child Abuse Hotline.

Clevenger, who in one episode of Cheer Perfection treated a flat-iron burn with her own urine, has been released on bond and has to wear a GPS monitoring device.

The show follows a group of young cheerleaders at Cheer Time Revolution, located in Sherwood, as they endure the world of competitive cheerleading.

TLC had made no comment on the arrest.
