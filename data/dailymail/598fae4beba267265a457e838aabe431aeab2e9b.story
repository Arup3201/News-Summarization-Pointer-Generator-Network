Bayern Munich proved they are ready to be a force in 2015 after easing to a 4-1 victory against the Qatar Stars on Tuesday.

Youngster Mitchell Weiser impressed in the winter-break friendly with two goals against a side managed by former Swansea boss Michael Laudrup.

The German giants haven’t played since a December 19 Bundesliga victory against Mainz but showed no signs of rustiness.

Weiser netted twice early on before the visitors equalised after Pablo Hernandez, another former swan, set up Hamdi Harbaoui to cut the deficit.

Bayern restored their two-goal advantage though through Franck Ribery, as Pep Guardiola’s side looked to turn on the style.

But they were made to be patient in the second half before Claudio Pizarro rounded off the win.
