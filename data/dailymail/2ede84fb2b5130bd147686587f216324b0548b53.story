England manager Roy Hodgson will be at Selhurst Park to run a personal check on Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane against Crystal Palace.

Hodgson is pondering whether to give the 21-year-old his first call-up with England's next game a Euro 2016 qualifier on March 27 against Lithuania.

It is the England manager's first game of 2015 and could also give him a chance to monitor Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Eric Dier and Andros Townsend.

Kane is after being named in the England squad following Hodgson's recent praise of the starlet.

The Three Lions boss described Kane as having 'come on leaps and bounds' after his two goals against Chelsea during Tottenham's 5-3 win at White Hart Lane.  

Hodgson's selection, however, could have repercussions for Gareth Southgate, the England Under-21 manager, ahead of the European U21 Championship in June.

'Harry is one of those players – Andros Townsend being another one – who didn't exactly burst on to the scene in his club side and get straight in,' Hodgson told SiriusXM FC.

'They got loaned out first and sent out to different places to learn their trade, if you like, or at least pick up some important aspects of their trade.

After a stunning first half of the season Kane is now in line to make the step up to the England senior side

England manager Roy Hodgson described Tottenham's Kane as having 'come on leaps and bounds'

'We have watched [Kane] for a while and I worked with him briefly in the Under-21s when I filled in for one game. Harry has come on in leaps and bounds and I'm not surprised because I know [former coaches] Tim Sherwood and Les Ferdinand very well.

'They have worked with him at Tottenham and they always believed in him as a goalscorer. It's tremendous to see people like him doing so well and quite strange that in the Under-21s a year or two ago we were bemoaning the fact we didn't think our forwards were up to the level of the midfielders. 

'And yet suddenly Kane, Saido Berahino and Danny Ings are all doing exceptionally well. It will be a headache for Gareth who he picks to play in the summer.'
