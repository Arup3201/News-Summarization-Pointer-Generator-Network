Barack Obama launched a scathing attack on super-rich jet owners yesterday as he desperately looked for a way to deal with the country's spiraling debt.

The President focused attention on class differences as he sought to increase taxes for people earning over $250,000 and tackle the Republicans over their plans for the economy.

But outraged critics retaliated by pointing out that just running a private jet costs $500,000 a year - far more than a family earning $250,000 could afford. Meanwhile, the average jet costs $5m just to buy.

Chided: President Barack Obama attacked Republican lawmakers today

They suggested that Obama's 
announcements at a conference on Monday were simply a smokescreen in 
order to raise taxes among middle-class families.

Republicans and the tea party want to tackle debt by cutting public services while also lowering taxes for the average citizen.

Obama said that Democrats had agreed to billions of dollars in budget cuts that would inevitably lose them votes.

But he accused Republicans of 
refusing to compromise by not agreeing to eliminate tax breaks to owners
of corporate jets and profit-rich oil companies.

'I'm proposing we get rid of are tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, tax breaks for oil companies and hedge fund managers and corporate jet owners,' Obama said.

The president said Democrats had already shown they were ready to 'take on their sacred cows' by agreeing to big cuts in programs important to the party and its supporters. Republicans must be too, he said.

'I've said to Republican leaders, 
''You go talk to your constituents and ask them, Are you willing to 
compromise your kids' safety so some corporate-jet owner can get a tax 
break?'' '

Luxury: Private jets coast around $5m and $500,000 a year to run - far more than somebody earning $250,000 could afford

Obama mentioned corporate jets three more times before moving on.

But he provoked anger after it was 
pointed out that hundreds of wealthy Democrat donors - who Obama has 
rewarded with cushy jobs in government - fly on corporate jets.

Commentators also highlighted the amount of private trips Obama takes on private jets when going for family holidays. 

For the third consecutive year Obama is planning to return to Martha's Vineyard for vacation this summer, according to a White House official.

The Obamas are scheduled to spend seven to 10 days on the island in the Cape Cod in New England in mid- to late August, according to the official.

Arrangements for White House staff members and Secret Service personnel who travel with the Obamas have been made.

Obama has began focusing on the economy after repeated warnings from financial organisations and appalling poll ratings.

The Treasury Department says it must be able to borrow more money by August 2 or the U.S. faces an unprecedented default on its mounting $14.3 trillion debt, predicted to grow by $1.4 trillion by the end of this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.

Obama, facing a re-election bid in November 2012, has watched his poll numbers languish below 50 percent approval, primarily because of the sluggish economic recovery after the Great Recession.

Critics point out that Obama simply lacks the strength to take on the federal reserve and big businesses that are pulling government strings on the economy.

With the coming election fight 
clearly in mind, he openly attacked Republicans for holding to what he 
called an 'unsustainable' position. Regardless, the opposition party 
says it will not vote to raise the debt limit unless Democrats agree - 
without any taxes increases - to $2 trillion in cuts to government 
spending over 10 years.

Obama's aggressive response came with
the country souring on the recovery, the Republican presidential 
contenders taking aim at his economic record and opposition leaders in 
Congress challenging him to show more leadership in the debt stalks.

His re-election hinges on the economy, and Obama is trying to restore a sense of public confidence.Obama has faced such countdowns before.

A generic Republican candidate would beat Obama if the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 were hole now, polls have revealed.

The Republicans have been ahead for the last five weeks but they currently have the biggest lead between the candidates.A republican candidate currently has support from 46 per cent of voters, according to the latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey.

The president picks up just 42 per cent of the vote while three per cent of people prefer some other candidate.Nine per cent are currently undecided. Both parties will be looking to target this group of voters.The unnamed Republican candidate was winning by 45 per cent to 43 per cent last week.

A more accurate indication of the outcome of the elections will come from the polls when the Republicans nominate their presidential candidate.

Republicans also hold a seven-point lead over Democrats on the Generic Congressional Ballot for the week ending Sunday, June 26. 

Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney leads the race for the Republican nomination but Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann is in second place following the GOP debate on June 13.

She accused Obama of failing black and Hispanic communities.

He
and Congress avoided a government shutdown earlier this year at the 
last possible moment. And they cut a deal on taxes in December, days 
before a tax increase would have automatically kicked in.

Facing
what most economists predict would be a catastrophic outcome if the 
U.S. cannot pay its bills, Obama took his message to the American 
people. Polls show a majority of voters broadly support higher taxes for
wealthy Americans and Big Oil.

The comments came as Obama scolded 
congressional lawmakers while urging them to forego their July 4 
vacations and focus on solving the nation’s debt crisis.

Using
his own daughters' study habits as examples, the impatient president 
said no more time should be wasted in trying to get a deal in place.

‘If
by the end of this week, we have not seen substantial progress, then I 
think members of Congress need to understand, we are going to, you know,
start having to cancel things and stay here until we get it done,’ the 
President warned.

‘They're in one week, they're out one week and then they're saying, “Obama's got to step in,’ he added.

‘You need to be here. I've been here.
I've been doing Afghanistan and Bin Laden ... Greek crisis. You stay 
here. Let's get it done.’

In
a personal touch to his lecture to the lawmakers who were preparing for
a long recess at the end of the week, Mr Obama insisted the 
procrastinating should stop.

‘Malia and Sasha generally finish their homework a day ahead of time,’ he said, adding, ‘Malia's 13, Sasha's 10.

They don't wait until the night before. They're not pulling all-nighters.

‘Congress can do the same thing. If you know you've got to do something, just do it,’ he added.

Mr
Obama’s vacation postponement demand was supported by Tea Party 
favourite Senator Rand Paul, who agreed that lawmakers should remain at 
their desks until they have hammered out an agreement.

The testy president repeated his demand to reduce America’s federal debt by eliminating tax breaks for the wealthy, and called on Congress not to sabotage middle-class priorities such as education and Medicare.

‘The tax cuts I'm proposing we get rid of are tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, tax breaks for oil companies and hedge fund managers and corporate jet owners,’ he said.

With members of Congress still bickering in a debate to try and reach agreement to raise the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt limit by the August 2 deadline, Mr Obama said failure was not an option.

‘The consequences for the US economy will be significant and unpredictable. We don't know how capital markets will react,’ he said at a White House press conference this morning.

The president said he is 'not engaging in scare tactics,’

But he added: ‘These are bills that Congress ran up. The money's been spent. The obligations have been made.

If his bid to get a higher debt limit fails, Mr Obama said tough decisions would have to be made to decide ‘which bills are we going to decide to pay.’

He claimed that if Chinese investors must be paid to avoid default, it could mean not paying Social Security or disabled veterans.
