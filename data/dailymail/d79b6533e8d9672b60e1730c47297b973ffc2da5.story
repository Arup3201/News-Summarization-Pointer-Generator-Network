Two Providence College basketball players have been accused of sexually assaulting another student on campus.

An 18-year-old woman claimed she was assaulted by freshman players Rodney Bullock and Brandon Austin on November 2 and into the early hours of November 3, according to reports.

The student, who knew the players, reported the incident to police on March 6. They are now investigating.

However, Bullock's lawyer claims the college conducted an internal investigation when the incident first came to light in November, and cleared the men of the allegations.

The players were initially 
suspended on November 6, shortly before the season began, on the day a complaint about the incident was lodged.

They were suspended for 'not upholding their responsibilities as 
student-athletes', according to the school.

The school announced in December that Bullock and Austin would not be allowed to play for the entire season.

Providence spokesman Steve Maurano refused to give details about the initial complaint, but said he would 'recommend 
against drawing any conclusions that our (on-campus) process ended with a
 finding that our student-athlete was found responsible for sexual 
assault'.

Bullock's lawyer, Bill Lynch, said a school investigation cleared the players of sexual assault.

'The school did an exhaustive review, interviewed all the parties including the two male students, who voluntarily participated in the process,' he said.

'There was never a finding against either of the students that there was a sexual assault.'

Austin has since transferred to the University of Oregon.

An Oregon spokesman did not immediately comment but said coach Dana Altman would be willing to address the issue at his scheduled news conference as the team prepares for its first NCAA tournament game in Milwaukee.

The spokesman, Andy McNamara, said he didn't know if Austin had a lawyer.

Providence is also playing in the NCAA tournament after winning the Big East Tournament for the first time in 20 years.

The 11th seed Friars flew Wednesday morning to San Antonio, where they're scheduled to play North Carolina on Friday.

Lynch questioned the timing of the allegations.

'Suddenly, a week before Providence is playing on the NCAA tournament, there's a complaint filed? I'm getting too old to believe in coincidences,' he said.

He said his client had not yet been contacted by the police. If he is, Lynch said, 'he will do exactly as he did at the review at the school and participate 100 percent voluntarily'.
