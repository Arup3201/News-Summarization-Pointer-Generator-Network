'The opportunities are enormous': Drilling for shale gas should take place 'all over rural parts of the UK', Owen Paterson has declared

Drilling for shale gas should take place ‘all over rural parts of the UK’, Owen Paterson has declared.

The Environment Secretary risks a clash with green groups over his plans for the controversial technology, but says Britain must cash in on gas trapped in rocks deep underground to ‘create prosperity and jobs’.

He said shale has already dramatically reduced gas prices in the US, now a net exporter of energy, and it would be done safely in Britain.

‘The opportunities here are enormous,’ he said during questioning by a House of Lords committee yesterday.

‘I would like to see shale gas exploited all over rural parts of the UK.’

Mr Paterson said opponents of fracking, such as those who besieged an exploratory well in Balcombe in Sussex last year, were ‘doing a good job at alarming the public’ and admitted that the Government had to do more to convince the country of its benefits.

And he said the supporters of fracking had to make their voices heard, as he conceded opponents are currently getting their message across more effectively on Facebook and Twitter.

‘We have to be more glass half-full’, Mr Paterson said. ‘The fact is I would like to see shale gas exploited all over rural parts of the UK. We need to get on the front foot.’

The shale gas thought to be beneath Lancashire alone could meet Britain’s need for half a century.

David Cameron has thrown his weight behind a drilling programme and offered generous tax breaks for fracking firms announced in January.

In addition local communities have been promised a £100,000 sweetener if a test well is ‘fracked’ near them, as well as one per cent of future revenues.

Mr Paterson said ‘It really is important to convince people. There is absolutely no way we are cutting corners or cutting down the rigour of our environmental regulation, and done professionally and properly there is nothing to fear.’

He said people ‘shouldn’t turn their nose up’ at the community payments. ‘It’s very significant money’, he said.

Opposition: Mr Paterson said opponents of fracking, such as these who besieged an exploratory well in Balcombe, Sussex, last year, were 'doing a good job at alarming the public'

Greenpeace’s Lawrence Carter hit back: ‘Amidst the usual jumble of bogus claims and exaggerations, Paterson has spoken one embarrassing truth - the government has failed to convince the public that fracking is safe.

'This is why ministers are planning to speed up the issuing of fracking permits whilst stripping away legal protections for homeowners who don’t want companies drilling under their homes.’
