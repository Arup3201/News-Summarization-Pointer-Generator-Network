Sir Stephen House, Chief Constable for Scotland has provoked mixed reaction from colleagues for his pro-active approach to policing

The most senior police officer in Scotland has been warned against making arrests - because of fears that he is putting himself at unnecessary risk by enforcing the law.

It comes after Sir Stephen House flagged down a motorist on the M8 near Glasgow as he was travelling on a police motorcyle.

He was later joined by traffic officers but this apparently was not enough to justify the risk to his personal safety.

It is not the first time Sir Stephen has intervened to tackle motorists he suspects of drink-driving or speeding.

Last week Police Scotland told The Sunday Times that the Chiref Constable 'regularly undertakes journeys in uniform ... on a marked police motorbike.'

They added: 'The chief constable has on occasion had reason to deal with members of the public when issues such as driver behaviour have come to his attention.'

Although some of applauded Sir Stephen on his hands-on attitude to policing others have questioned whether his actions are appropriate given his level of seniority and in their statement

Police Scotland refused to give details of exactly what he had done.

There is a worry that by carrying out policing without backup from his colleagies Sir Stephen could leave himself open to bogus complaints from a member of the public.

Although this is an issue faced daily by rank-and-file officers some believe that given his position it is a risk that the Chief Constable need not take. 

Graeme Pearson, a former police officer who is now a Labour MSP and member of the Scottish parliament’s justice sub-committee on policing, told The Sunday Times that not only was he concerned about that vulnerablity of the Chief Constable but also that he ought to find better uses for his time.

He said: 'I understand the concerns expressed by police officers about their chief constable acting in this way, particularly given he is head of the national service.

'Without a colleague on hand, Sir Stephen could find himself in difficulties not only in terms of a complaint but also in circumstances that escalate at the roadside as a result of his intervention.

'I would always expect a police officer to intervene when a crime is being committed or life is at risk, but if the chief constable has the time to stop speeding motorists instead of calling in road patrol, I think on his salary he would be better occupied dealing with the many strategic issues facing his staff and the public.'

Sir Stephen is well renowned within the police force for his enthusiasm for street policing.

When he became Chief constable of Strathclyde police, which was previously Scotlan's largest police force, in 2007 he continued to regularly go out on patrol.

He is also thought to have joined his colleagues in a policing of a march by members of the far-right Scottish Defence League in Edinburgh last August.

But despite concerns Sir Stephen, who earns £208,000 a year, has been congratualted on his actions be senior officers.

David O’Connor, president of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents, said: 'Police officers can work in pairs for reasons of corroboration and health and safety, but you take the oath and you’re expected to do the job.

'Our mission is to keep people safe and if you’re on duty, in uniform, and see something that needs dealing with, it would be remiss not do so and could impact on public confidence.

'I think it’s laudable we have a chief constable who is highly visible. There are many police officers who carry out their duties alone.'

And it appears Sir Stephen is not alone in his proactive stance - in June, Dave Jones, the new chief constable of North Yorkshire police, was applauded for chasing suspected criminals through Richmond town centre on his first day in the job.
