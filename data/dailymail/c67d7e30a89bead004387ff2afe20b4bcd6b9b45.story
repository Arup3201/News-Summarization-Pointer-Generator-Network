A jury in the trial of the former lover of paedophile rock singer Ian Watkins has been told it will be allowed to return a majority verdict.

Joanne Mjadzelics is on trial at Cardiff Crown Court accused of possessing indecent images of children.

The prosecution say the former prostitute was obsessed with the Lostprophets singer and would do anything to fuel his depraved desires.

Mjadzelics, 39, of Doncaster, is charged with four counts of possessing indecent images of a child, one of inciting Watkins to send her illegal photographs and two of sending pictures to Watkins.

Watkins is currently serving a 35 year term for a string of sex offences - including the attempted rape of a fan’s baby.

Mjadzelics’ defence is she was trying to entrap Watkins by collecting evidence on his sex offending.

She insists she had reported Watkins to police before, but was not taken seriously - and was regarded by officers as a “nut job” and a spurned ex-girlfriend who was a “nuisance” to a famous singer.

The Recorder of Cardiff Judge Eleri Rees previously urged the 11-member jury to return a unanimous verdict.

But after more than eight hours of deliberations, Judge Rees said she would accept a majority verdict on which at least 10 of them agreed.

During her summing up of the case yesterday, she said: “You must reach your decision based on what you have heard in this court room - not on anything that you have seen or heard outside it.”

The Recorder of Cardiff Judge Eleri Rees, sitting at Cardiff Crown Court, said he would accept a majority verdict on which at least 10 of the jury agreed
