Controversial: An article written by Rod Liddle, pictured, called defendants Gary Dobson and David Norris 'disgusting racists' during the Old Bailey trial

A magazine is being prosecuted for potentially putting the Stephen Lawrence trial in danger of collapse.

The Spectator is accused of breaching a court order preventing prejudicial material being published before jurors reached verdicts.

An article written by Rod Liddle called defendants Gary Dobson and David Norris 'disgusting racists' during the Old Bailey trial.

Mr Justice Treacy said the Spectator article titled 'A Vindictive Charade' breached three specific sections of the contempt order placed on the case by the Lord Chief Justice in the appeal court, and continued at the trial.

He referred the magazine to the Attorney General for contempt of court in November.

The judge also banned the jury from reading that week’s Spectator, even if they were a subscriber and it had dropped through their letterbox.

Liddle wrote that Dobson and Norris were part of a bigger group of suspects who had been named in the press, including Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight.

He also said that Norris had a father who was a major criminal.

The Spectator took down the article from its website that afternoon.

The Crown Prosecution Service announced today that the magazine would be prosecuted for breaching a court order.

CPS London chief prosecutor Alison Saunders said the publisher of the magazine had been summonsed to appear at Westminster magistrates court on June 7.

However, Neville Lawrence has criticised the decision to prosecute the magazine for
jeopardising his son's murder trial as 'a slap on the wrist'.

The Spectator said it would admit the offence and faces a fine of up to £5,000.

But Mr Lawrence said it should have been dealt with under contempt of 
court legislation, which could have seen the publisher jailed or face an
unlimited fine.

Mr Lawrence said: 'I am very disappointed by this outcome and think the charge should have been for a more serious offence.

'The article was published at a critical time at the start of the case 
when it was clear that any press comments could cause the trial to 
collapse.

'I understand that the maximum fine is £5,000, which is little more than a slap on the wrist for a magazine like The Spectator.'

Jocelyn Cockburn, acting for Mr Lawrence, added: 'It was open to the 
Attorney General to go for a more serious contempt of court charge.

'His decision not to refer this charge to the CPS was based on his 
judgment that the course of justice was not seriously impeded or 
prejudiced by the article.

'This article came out at the worst possible time, particularly for my client, who had already witnessed one aborted trial.

'It was a cruel and reprehensible act by this magazine which does merit a more serious punishment than a minuscule fine.'

Fraser Nelson, editor of The Spectator, said the magazine would admit the offence.

He said: 'We apologised in court 
for this article in November, and accept that it transgressed the 
reporting restrictions then in place.

'The judge accepted our apology and we will not be contesting the CPS's decision.'

In the article, Liddle said the judge had asked jurors to approach the case with a clean slate.

He
added: 'That is, not be inclined to prejudge the issue as a consequence
of having been assured, repeatedly, for the last 12 years, by the 
entire press, that the men accused are disgusting racist bastards and 
definitely guilty.

'Judge 
Treacy might as well have told the jurors that they must approach the 
case ‘by eating 15 Jacobs cream crackers, without any water or other 
emolument, inside one minute’. The case is a charade, and a vindictive 
charade at that.'

The Crown Prosecution Service today informed the publishers of The Spectator of its decision to charge them with an offence under Section 83 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

Ms Saunders said: 'On 24 November 2011 the Attorney General referred an article published in The Spectator magazine to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration of whether a reporting restrictions Order in place at the time had been breached.

'Due to the intense media interest in this case an Order under Section 82 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 prohibiting publication of certain assertions about the defendants was in place.

'This Order was imposed by the Court of Appeal on 18 May 2011 and was continued at the commencement of the trial on 14 November 2011.

'Having applied the full code test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors I have taken the decision that there is a realistic prospect of conviction.

'The Attorney General has determined that it is in the public interest to proceed and he has given his consent to this prosecution.

'Where a charge is brought under Section 83 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the publication is a newspaper or periodical, the proprietor, editor or publisher may be liable for the offence, and not the author.'

A spokesman for the Attorney General's office said: 'The Attorney did consider the article in terms of the strict liability rule under the Contempt of Court Act 1981, but concluded that the matter was best dealt with in relation to the order under section 82, given the particular reporting.'
