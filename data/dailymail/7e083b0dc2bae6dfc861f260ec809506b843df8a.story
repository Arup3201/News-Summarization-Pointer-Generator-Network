The BBC has been accused of ‘crass insensitivity’ towards the family of PC Keith Blakelock after it allowed the man cleared of killing him to gloat about the circumstances of the officer’s death.

Nicky Jacobs – who was last week found not guilty of murdering PC Blakelock in the 1985 Tottenham riots – described the killing as ‘celebration time’ during an appearance on Newsnight.

Although he was cleared of any involvement in the murder, the 45-year-old said he wished he had been present when the officer died and accused the police of ‘wickedness’ towards the black community.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Jacobs’ remarks were insensitive and said it was wrong for the BBC to interview him so soon after PC Blakelock’s family had their hopes of justice quashed in court.

‘It is a shame the BBC didn’t think to give PC Blakelock’s family a platform to talk about their pain,’ he said. ‘This interview will be hard for them to hear. It is crass insensitivity.

‘I can only assume Newsnight are trying to boost ratings with their controversial editorial decisions.’

Clearly proud of gaining exclusive access to Mr Jacobs, Newsnight editor Ian Katz ensured the interview gained maximum publicity by promoting it in a series of Tweets before it was screened on Wednesday.

During the interview, Mr Jacobs – who was 16 at the time of PC Blakelock’s death – reiterated that he was not responsible for the murder during a riot on the Broadwater Farm estate on October 6, 1985.

Despite insisting he was ‘nowhere near’ the crime, Mr Jacobs did admit that, at the time, he wished he had been present. Interviewer Kurt Barling asked him: ‘Was there a moment in your mind at 16 where you thought “Ah, I’ve missed the main event”?’

He replied: ‘It did cross my mind, because like I said at that time the wickedness that the police used to do to the black community, yeah it was celebration time.’

Mr Jacobs had been accused of murder after three men claimed they saw him stabbing PC Blakelock.

But he was cleared at the Old Bailey last week after the evidence of the trio was found to be riddled with inaccuracies and inconsistencies.

Mr Jacobs told Newsnight that PC Blakelock’s murder was wrong ‘without a doubt’ and said he sympathised with the desire of the officer’s family to find his killers.

But he also suggested the police were responsible for provoking the riots that culminated in his death. ‘I saw it as my right to go and throw stones,’ he said. ‘It was people’s right to go out and be a protester, sat outside the police station, smash a window. It was that climate.’

The Tottenham riot was sparked by the death of 49-year-old resident Cynthia Jarrett during a police raid. She had a heart condition and suffered a cardiac arrest, but Mr Jacobs blamed her death on the police.

‘Miss Jarrett in my eyes had been killed,’ he told Newsnight. ‘The accident that was supposed to have happened, no one was hearing that.

‘If you can imagine, it was these police turning up ... looking for a black youth.

‘A black woman has died as a result – it doesn’t matter if she collapsed, high blood pressure or none of that, police were present and she died. You know what I mean – it was a regular occurrence at the time.’

Mr Jacobs said he empathised with PC Blakelock’s family, but said he felt they should direct their anger towards the ‘system’ and the ‘establishment’.

The BBC said it did not pay Mr Jacobs for the interview and notified PC Blakelock’s family that it was taking place.

A spokesman added: ‘The acquittal of Nicky Jacobs raised a number of issues about the investigation into the murder of PC Keith Blakelock, and the subsequent prosecution.

'We believe Jacobs has important things to say about these subjects, which are in the public interest for us to report.’
