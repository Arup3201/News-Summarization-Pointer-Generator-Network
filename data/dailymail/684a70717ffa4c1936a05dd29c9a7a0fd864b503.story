Dramatic new research has claimed that the effects of global warming may be less that first predicted.

Australian scientists have narrowed the predicted range of global warming through groundbreaking new research.

However, the team behind it said the smaller rise could still have major effects - and warned we cannot wait for more exact figures before acting.

The paper, published in Nature Climate Change today, found that exceeding 6 degrees warming was now unlikely while exceeding 2 degrees is very likely for business-as-usual emissions

The paper, published in Nature 
Climate Change today, found that exceeding 6 degrees warming was now 
unlikely while exceeding 2 degrees is very likely for business-as-usual 
emissions.

Dr Roger Bodman from Victoria University and Professors David Karoly and Peter Rayner from the University of Melbourne have generated what they say are more reliable projections of global warming estimates at 2100.

This was achieved through a new method combining observations of carbon dioxide and global temperature variations with simple climate model simulations to project future global warming.

Team leader Dr Bodman said while continuing to narrow the range even further was possible, significant uncertainty in warming predictions would always remain due to the complexity of climate change drivers.

'This study ultimately shows why waiting for certainty will fail as a strategy,' he said.

A recent climate change protest in London: 'Our results reconfirm the need for urgent and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if the world is to avoid exceeding the global warming target of 2 degrees needed to minimise dangerous climate change,' the researchers said

'Some uncertainty will always remain, meaning that we need to manage the risks of warming with the knowledge we have.'

The study found 63% of uncertainty in projected warming was due to single sources – such as climate sensitivity, followed by future behaviour of the carbon cycle and the cooling effect of aerosols – while 37% of uncertainty came from the combination of these sources.

'This means that if any single uncertainty is reduced – even the most important, climate sensitivity – significant uncertainty will remain,' Dr Bodman said.

Professor Karoly said the study reinforced the importance of strong action on climate change.

'Our results reconfirm the need for urgent and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if the world is to avoid exceeding the global warming target of 2 degrees needed to minimise dangerous climate change,' he said.

A typical, simple dinoflagellate associated with the early Oligocene epoch and found in 33 million year-old sediments, helping prove the age of the Antarctic ice cap

The Antarctic continental ice cap came into existence during the Oligocene epoch, some 33.6 million years ago, according to a study of ice sediments.

The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program 
international expedition has obtained this information from the 
paleoclimatic history preserved in sediment in the Antarctic depths.

Before the ice covered Antarctica, the Earth was a warm place with a tropical climate.

In this region, plankton diversity was high until glaciation reduced the populations - leaving only those capable of surviving in the new climate.

The study, published in the journal 
Science in April, focused on single-celled plankton called 
dinoflagellates, which contain materials that fossilize.

Before the 
Eocene-Oligocene transition about 34 million years ago, Antarctic 
dinoflagellates were extremely diverse.

When the ice pack formed, 
however, only plankton that could survive cold temperatures and a 
seasonal freeze-melt cycle remained.

An expedition
 led by the Andalusian Institute of Earth Sciences (IACT) has analysed those populations.

IACT researcher Carlota Escutia, who led the expedition, said the 'the fossil record of dinoflagellate cyst communities reflects the substantial reduction and specialization of these species that took place when the ice cap became established and, with it, marked seasonal ice-pack formation and melting began'.
