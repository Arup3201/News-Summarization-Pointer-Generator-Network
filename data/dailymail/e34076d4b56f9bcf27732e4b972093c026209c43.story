A stainless steel slide has been installed at the RedDot Hotel in Taiwan for guests to enjoy on their way down from their rooms

The slide consists of 102 stainless steel panels, which took five workers and £100,000 to build - definitely worth it!

The innovative slide was designed by General Manager Stephen Wu who said it has had a brilliant reception by adventurous guests

The spiral feature was inspired by the innovative Google offices, and allows guests to swiftly travel from the second to the first floor. 

The sleek hotel had to overcome a number of obstacles in order to create the slippery attraction. 

'When it was transported to the hotel it was divided into four major segments,' said the General Manager Steven Wu, who designed the slide. 

'It was a big feat of engineering, we really feel a sense of achievement that we accomplished it.

'We asked five craftsmen to make it before we found someone who would do it. That's how difficult it was.'

Adults and children alike have used the slide, which was created with the talents of five craftsmen 

The fun stainless steel feature was not cheap to install, and set back the hotel £100,000. 

It consists of 102 stainless steel sheet, which add to the hotel's array of quirky furniture and ornaments, including a barber chairs in the lobby.

Steven said: 'Each time passengers slide down they laugh out loud and enjoy it.

'With the stainless steel and accompanying neon lights, it becomes a tunnel which brings back memories of childhood.

'I truly believe that the slide is not simply for fun but rather it is a symbolic object reserving time and space for travellers.'

The 30 metre long slide fits right into the boutique hotel, which is adorned in neon sights and quirky seating in the reception area
