A blundering burglar who evaded police for seven years was caught after he appeared in his local paper for a 'Win a Wedding' contest.

Vincent Condron, 36, was hauled back before a judge in Cardiff two weeks ago after a police officer recognised a picture of him in a copy of the South Wales Echo with his fiance Rebecca Young.

Condron was originally given a 12-month community order in 2006 after being convicted of burglary and shoplifting two DVD box sets.

After he failed to comply with several requirements of the sentence a warrant for his arrest was issued in 2007, but he failed to turn up in court.

Condron, a heroin addict, had in fact fled to Ireland in order to get clean, before studying at a college in Dublin.

He then returned to Cardiff, found love, and now has plans to set up his own business.

Yesterday Judge Judge Eleri Rees sentenced Condron to 28 days in prison, but having already spent 14 days in custody since his arrest, he was expected to be released within hours.

During those two weeks Judge Rees assessed evidence about how Condron had turned his life around.

Defending him, David Leathley said: 'His father can confirm that he went to the counselling sessions with him and he has returned clean.'

'He did go to Ireland in 2007 but it was at a time when he was hopelessly addicted to heroin and that was the key to his offending.

'He knew he couldn’t beat it in Cardiff where there were dealers he owed money and who had his cards marked. He fled for his own safety and sought the help he needed.'

Condron is due to resit the last of his exams next summer and sees his future in holistic medicine, Mr Leathley said.

The couple’s testimony in the Echo competition said: 'We met at Christmas 2011 through family. Despite the distance between Dublin and Cardiff we maintained daily contact through the internet and saw each other as often as we could. We fell in love.

'Vincent moved to Cardiff in this year and we are engaged to be married.'
