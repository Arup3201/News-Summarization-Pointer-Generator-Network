Angela Merkel threw a lifeline to David Cameron last night in his battle to prevent another arch-federalist seizing power at the European Commission.

The German Chancellor paid lip service to supporting former Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who is her party’s official candidate for the post of commission president.

But she also hit out at critics of Mr Cameron in both Berlin and Brussels, saying it was ‘unacceptable’ to ignore the UK’s concerns about Mr Juncker.

Her intervention came as speculation mounted that French IMF chief Christine Legarde could yet emerge as a compromise candidate for the job.

Mr Cameron has privately branded Mr Juncker a ‘face from the 1980s’ who ‘cannot solve the problems of the next five years’, and has spent the past fortnight leading frantic diplomatic efforts to block Mr Juncker’s coronation.

He is said to have warned Mrs Merkel privately that the UK could quit the EU if Mr Juncker is appointed.

'More confident than ever': Mr Cameron has spent the past fortnight leading frantic diplomatic efforts to block Jean-Claude Juncker's appointment

Mr Juncker, a technocrat who has 
powerful allies across the EU, yesterday boasted that he was ‘more 
confident than ever that I will be the next Commission president’.

But, in a blow to his claim to be the 
people’s choice for the job, a major survey found that just eight per 
cent of European voters know who he is.

Mr Cameron’s all-out bid to block Mr Juncker has sparked anger in both Brussels and Berlin.

Germany’s leading magazine Spiegel yesterday launched an astonishing attack on Britain over the Juncker row, saying the UK had ‘for years blackmailed and made a fool of the EU.’

In an extraordinary editorial the magazine said Britain was insular and sullen – and said its opposition to Mr Juncker was ‘undemocratic’, as his centre-right grouping in the European Parliament emerged as the biggest group in last month’ s elections.

‘Britain must choose now if it will stay in Europe,’ it said. ‘The United Kingdom must finally make a choice - it can play by the rules or it can leave the European Union.’

Mrs Merkel hit back yesterday with a speech to the German parliament in which she insisted she would not allow Britain to be isolated on the issue.

She told German MPs it was ‘grossly negligent, actually unacceptable, how easily some talk about it not mattering whether Great Britain agrees or not, even whether Great Britain remains a member of the European Union or not. This is anything but irrelevant, unimportant or trivial.’

She said good decisions in Brussels are rarely rushed and added ‘we need time, we have it and so I am using it.’

David Cameron will today act as a Cold War messenger for the United States when he holds face-to-face talks with Vladimir Putin on the crisis in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister will deliver a toughly-worded message from Barack Obama, who has refused to meet Mr Putin when world leaders gather in Normandy to commemorate D-Day.

Mr Cameron will hold talks with President Obama today following the G7 summit in Brussels, before travelling to France where he will relay the American message directly to President Putin.

Mr Obama yesterday accused the Russian leader of reverting to the ‘dark tactics of the 20th century’ in Ukraine. In a blunt warning to President Putin, he added: ‘The days of empires and spheres of influence are over.’

Speaking in Brussels last night, Mr Cameron said Moscow would face ‘continuing isolation’ until it stops trying to destabilise Ukraine.

Mrs Merkel is under massive pressure 
at home to support Mr Juncker’s bid to replace outgoing Commission chief
 Jose-Manuel Barroso.

Yesterday she insisted she was ‘trying to ensure that the lead candidate of the European People's Party, Jean-Claude Juncker, receives the qualified majority he needs to become the next president of the European Commission. The entire German government is pushing for this.’

But her comments suggest she does not believe Mr Juncker can command a majority among European leaders.

Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Hungary are among a number of EU states said to share Mr Cameron’s concerns about the Luxembourger.

Mrs Merkel is reported to have sounded out French President Francois Hollande about nominating Miss Legarde for the Commission job.

But French sources suggested Mr Hollande was keen to keep her in place at the IMF. They also pointed out that she is from the opposite political tradition to the socialist French president.

Miss Legarde, who will travel to London on IMF business tomorrow, would be a popular candidate in both the UK and Germany.

But she is said to harbour ambitions of standing for the French presidency which would be incompatible with taking the top job in Brussels.
