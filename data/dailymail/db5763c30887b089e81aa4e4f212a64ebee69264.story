A history of London in maps - from Shakespeare's birth to today - reveals the capital's changing landscape over 450 years and how many were designed to show what the population ate or if they were 'vicious criminals' rather than helping people find their way.

The new exhibition, 'Mapping London', contains the oldest existing original map of London from 1572,  designed with bright colours and a boat-filled Thames to 'uplift the spirit' of armchair travellers rather than help give directions.

One from 1655 says it 'is a ready helpe or Guide to direct Countrey-men and Strangers to finde the nearest way from one place to another' and renamed streets like Bow Street in central London 'Theeving Lane' because of its high density of pickpockets.

1572: This magnificent plan, believed to be the oldest original of London in existence, was published by Braun and Hogenberg. In it London is depicted in birds-eye view from the south looking north. Four figures in traditional Tudor dress alongside Latin that says the capital is 'famed amongst many peoples for its commerce, adorned with houses and churches, distinguished by fortifications, famed for men of all arts and sciences, and lastly for its wealth in all things'

1799: Richard Horwood's map was produced for use by the Phoenix Fire Office, an insurance firm.  It was the largest map ever printed in Britain at the time, and the first attempt to produce a map of London with all of the houses delineated and numbered. It was plotted to show which buildings had the greatest fire risk

1922: MacDonald Gill's large London Underground map says:  'In the heat of the summer we will find me cool, in the cool of the winter will find me warm, come down underground you've bought you your ticket ? Your health man I'm thinking no longer twill stick it. For cheapness, celerity what else can compare. You are fed up above, feed below on our fare'. The coats of Arms are of the eight principal London Boroughs and a rabbit for London Underground, which he joke was the oldest Tube inhabitant

2012: For this work Simon Walter has painstakingly charted the buried rivers, Tube lines, bunkers, sewers, government tunnels and other subterranean secrets of London. The work also includes mysterious and underworld elements, such as unsolved murders, ley lines and pagan burial sites

In 1719 one map says London has 5,000 streets, 110,000 houses and the population is guessed at 'by what is eaten' by almost 700,000 'souls'.

A 1799 masterpiece drawn by Richard Horwood was the final attempt to map every building in London. It was paid for by insurers who wanted to know which homes and businesses were near candle makers or tanneries so they could increase premiums because of the fire threat.

An 1899 map is coloured by by street and its key says: 'The Lowest Class. Vicious, semi-criminal' (black); 'Very Poor, casual. Chronic Want' (blue); 'Poor. 18s to 21s a week for a moderate family' (light blue); 'Mixed. Some comfortable, others poor' (purple); 'Fairly Comfortable. Good ordinary earnings' (pink); 'Well-to-do. Middle class' (red); 'Upper-middle and Upper classes. Wealthy' (yellow).

At the centre of all the maps is the Thames, whose snaking path proved incredibly difficult to plot accurately and is different on every one of the older exhibits.

'Mapping London' is part of the Totally Thames Festival and also has spectacular maps from the present day, including Stephen Walter's 2012 creation 'Subterranea', showing the sewers, tubes, underground rivers and burial grounds that lie under the city.

The exhibition is curated by Daniel Crouch, one of the world's leading specialist map dealers, who also owns the first map of the Americas, the world's first colour atlas printed in colour and the first map ever printed, from 1475.

He found fame in 2007 after he sold an atlas in his collection for £2.1million and days later sold a map for $1million.

1655: Thomas Porter named this: 'The Newest and Exactest Mapp of the most Famous Citties London and Westminster with their Suburbs', and said it was designed to 'helpe or Guide to direct Countrey-men and Strangers to finde the nearest way from one place to another'

1746: Considered one of the finest maps of - what is now - Greater London John Rocque, a French Huguenot who emigrated with the rest of his family to London in the 1730s, took nine years to produce it and had it engraved upon 24 sheets of copper before it could be published in 1746

1812: Edward Langley and William Belche's map features the new and grand building and bridges of London, including the new docks of east London where Canary Wharf now stands. Areas due for development like Tavistock Square are coloured but blank as they were being built

1827: Christopher and John Greenwood's map is considered to be of Ordinance Survey standard. It is scaled at 8ins per mile and has detailed depictions of streets, houses, public buildings, parks, squares, woods, plantations, rivers, hills, windmills and boundaries. Below the plan is a dedication to George IV, which is flanked by views of Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral

1843: George Frederick Cruchley (1796-1880) was a publisher of ;some of the clearest and most attractive London maps'. This shows the expanding London and extends north to south from Highgate to Dulwich, and west to east from Hammersmith to Greenwich. Cruchley would re-issue the plan several times for the following 20 years, each time updating it with the latest additions.

Mapping London is free and runs until Sunday at the Oxo Tower Wharf on London's South Bank.
