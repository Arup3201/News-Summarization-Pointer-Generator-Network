Birds can pose a real threat to aircraft leaving and arriving into airports. 

So the ingenious folk at Southwest Florida International Airport have employed a very capable new member of staff to take matters into her own paws. 

Meet Aero, a one-year-old border collie, is the fourth in a line of four-legged bird chasers employed by the airport in Fort Myers.

One-year-old border collie Aero is Southwest Florida International Airport's new bird-chaser 

In her day-to-day job, Aero stalks birds on the airfield, using her herding instincts to chase them away from the runway.

'She acts as a natural predator, as opposed to some of the other techniques we use,' said Derek Faulkner, a Lee County Port Authority operations agent who works with Aero.

And the hard-working hound is unafraid of putting the hours in, working an eight-hour shift seven days a week - more than her human counterparts.

Aero, who cost $9,750 (approximately £6,200), including training, is rewarded with water breaks and rides in an air-conditioned fleet vehicle between bird chases, but unlike most employees, Aero doesn't get to take a holiday.

According to her employers, the collie is more than happy in her role.

'She leads a plush lifestyle. And there's nothing bad in her employee file,' airport spokeswoman Victoria Moreland told News Press.

Methods used by airports to scare away birds include sirens, pyrotechnics and fake owls, and wildlife is kept away from danger zones by limiting the amount of trees and shrubs nearby.  

But Southwest Florida International is the only US commercial airport with a bird dog.

According to statistics from the Federal Aviation Administration, wildlife strikes on commercial aircraft more than quadrupled between 1990 and 2013.

The Fort Myers airport has averaged at 35 a year, with fewer than three  causing any damage to aircraft since they began using bird dogs in 1999, News Press reported.
