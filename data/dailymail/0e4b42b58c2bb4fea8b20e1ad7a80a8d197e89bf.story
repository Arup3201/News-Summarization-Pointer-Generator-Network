New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has hit out at accusations that his newly affectionate relationship with President Obama could have cost the Republicans the White House.

Christie said he was particularly unhappy how the word 'embrace' had been used to describe his teamwork with Obama and the Federal Government in the cleanup effort after Superstorm Sandy.

‘I’m a guy who tells the truth, all the time. And if the president of the United States did something good, I was going to say he did something good and give him credit for it,’ Christie told reporters in Harvey Cedars, New Jersey.

Chris Christie told reporters that he had the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney's candidacy

‘But it doesn’t take away for a minute the fact that I was the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney, that I traveled literally tens of thousands of miles for him, raised tens of millions of dollars for him and worked harder, I think, than any other surrogate in America other than Paul Ryan.’

In the run up to Tuesday's election, GOP
 operatives whined that Christie’s cordial treatment of President Obama,
 when he toured Sandy-ravaged neighborhoods of New Jersey, stopped the 
Republican’s momentum going into the election.

Christie described his critics as 
'know-nothing, disgruntled Romney supporters' who did not respect the 
duty he owed to the people of his state.

The new-found special relationship between Christie and the President works both ways and Obama  heaped praise on the New Jersey Gov. in his acceptance speech after his re-election Tuesday.

'I'm hopeful tonight because I've seen the spirit at work in America,' Obama said. 'I've seen it on the 
shores of New Jersey and New York, where leaders from every party and 
level of government have swept aside their differences to help a 
community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm.'

Now Obama has won re-election, 
it appears Christie, once a top contender as Romney's running mate, may 
be mapping out a different path into the White House.

Governor Christie voting onTuesday, could it be his name at the top of the GOP ticket in four years?

When asked what went wrong for Romney's presidential push, Christie deadpanned: ¿He didn¿t get enough votes¿

When asked what went wrong for Romney last night, Christie deadpanned: ‘He didn’t get enough votes.’

‘I’m not a pundit, I’m an office holder,’ Christie said.

The New Jersey governor shot to the top of early 2016 speculation in 
what will be a wide-open field for the GOP presidential spot.

On Monday it was revealed that 
Christie had been asked to appear with Romney at a campaign event in 
Morrisville, Pennsylvania, just 20 minutes away from the New Jersey 
state capital, Trenton.

The governor refused, leading to 
criticism from anonymous aides to the presidential candidate, one of 
whom said, 'You can't tell me he couldn't have gone over there for a 
night rally.'

Christie said that he told Romney before Sandy 
hit that he would be unable to continue campaigning 'if the storm landed
 as predicted'.

Support: Christie has been an outspoken advocate for Romney for more than a year

He 
continued: 'I said to him, "Listen, Mitt, if this storm hits the way I 
think it's going to, I'm off the campaign trail from here to Election 
Day."

'And he said to me, "Chris, of course. Do your job, don't worry about me. I'll take care of things."'

Christie did not blame Romney, a 
former governor of Massachusetts, for the criticism of him, saying: 
'He's been a governor - he knows.'

Instead,
 he added: 'All this other noise, I think, is coming from know-nothing, 
disgruntled Romney staffers who, you know, don't like the fact that I 
said nice things about the president of the United States. Well, that's 
too bad for them.'
