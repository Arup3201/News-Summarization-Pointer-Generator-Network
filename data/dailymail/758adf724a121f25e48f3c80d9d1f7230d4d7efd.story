Four years  after then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot, President Barack Obama says she still has 'the same energy and passion that she always had.'

Obama met Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, today while in Phoenix to give a speech on housing.

Obama called Giffords a hero, said he's proud of her and praised her gun control advocacy.

He says even as she's waged her own fight to recover, she's been fighting to prevent the next tragedy. 

Six people were killed and 13 were wounded in the 2011 shooting at a Giffords political event at a Tucson shopping center. 

Obama traveled to Tucson four days later to speak at a memorial service at the University of Arizona.

The city of Tuscson also honored the victims on the anniversary of the shooting today and rang 19 solemn bells as a tribute.

Giffords did not attend the event because she was with President Barack Obama in Phoenix.

In his speech today, Obama said: 'It was four years ago today that Gabby and some other wonderful Arizonans were gunned down outside a supermarket in Tucson. 

'It's a tough day for a lot of folks down there, we keep them in (our) thoughts and prayers.'

The ceremony in Tucson took place at 10:10 a.m. Thursday and included a bell-ringing for each of the 19 victims of the attack. Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild also hosted a bell-ringing ceremony at a fire station downtown.

'I think it's important that we never forget what happened because there are a lot of lessons that can be learned from what happened,' said former Arizona Rep. Ron Barber, who was wounded in the shooting and who attended the ceremony.

Peter Rhee, chief of the trauma at University of Arizona Medical Center, is the doctor credited with saving the lives of Giffords and others.

Standing outside the hospital Thursday, Rhee said he was changed by that day and thinks about it often. But he said many positive things came of the tragedy.

'The discussion on gun control is much higher on a national level. We can't just keep going on like this,' Rhee said.

The Jan. 8, 2011, shooting shook Tucson, a city that considers itself a tight-knit community despite its half-million residents. 

Among those killed was 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, whose face adorns many of the memorial messages left at the shooting site and the hospital. U.S. District Judge John Roll and Giffords aide Gabe Zimmerman were also killed. Barber, who worked for Giffords at the time, was wounded but later took over her seat in Congress.

Jared Loughner was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting.

Giffords, who was shot in the head, still struggles to speak and walk. She has become the face of gun control, having founded Americans for Responsible Solutions with her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly.

The gun control group raised millions for congressional candidates in the 2014 election, including Barber, who lost his seat to Republican Martha McSally. The group has garnered attention nationwide but has been able to do little to change gun laws.

Organizers with the January 8th Memorial, a nonprofit foundation, are in the final phase of selecting a designer for a permanent memorial that will be placed at a downtown Tucson park. 

The foundation hopes to finish the memorial this year, manager Michelle Crow said. It will be at El Presidio Park in downtown Tucson, but there are plans for other exhibits.

Items from memorials left at the site of the shooting and the hospital are on display in two rooms at the Arizona History Museum in Tucson. The exhibit began in October and ends Friday.
