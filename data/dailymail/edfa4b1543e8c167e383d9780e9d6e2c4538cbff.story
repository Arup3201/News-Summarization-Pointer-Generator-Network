In England, it is former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein who is remembered as the man who discovered Arsene Wenger.

In Monaco, though, they recall former club president Jean-Louis Campora taking a 37-year-old coach who had been relegated with Nancy and installing him with a multi-million budget.

Jean Petit was Wenger’s assistant when Mark Hateley and Glenn Hoddle were at the club. ‘I remember the president asking me whether I knew Arsene,’ said Petit, who is still a coach at Monaco.

If Arsene Wenger wins the Champions League I don't think Tottenham fans will ever forgive me... I told Arsenal to sign him, says  Hoddle

‘I had a friend, Jean-Marc Guillou [former France and Nice player], who knew him, and he said to me: “He will become one of the best managers in the world.” And when he came, you could see he would be someone important. He knew football. He was an intelligent young man who had a certain idea of football, tactically.

‘He came here with new methods, he made Monaco more professional. In training methods, in making sure our trips to and from games were done in private planes, those kind of things. Arsene was the start of the modern Monaco.’

But there is one feature of Wenger’s personality in those years which comes as a surprise. ‘He could get really angry in the dressing room,’ said Hoddle.

Hateley added: ‘The veins used to pop out of his head! He was an absolute firebomb in the dressing room if he wasn’t getting what he wanted.’

Hoddle said: ‘I remember talking to Tony Adams about him when he was at Arsenal. He told me he was very passive and never really got annoyed. And I thought: “Well he’s changed then. Because he did with us!”’

Wenger would leave Monaco in 1994. ‘It wasn’t the results, though,’ said Petit. ‘It was more to do with the relationship with the president. The marriage was over.’
