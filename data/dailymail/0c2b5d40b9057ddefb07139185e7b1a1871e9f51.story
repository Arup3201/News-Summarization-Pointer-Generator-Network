The wife of a former Minnesota Viking was convicted today of two felonies in a hit-and-run that killed a man.

Amy Senser was charged with three felony counts of criminal vehicular homicide in the death of Anousone Phanthavong.

Senser was found guilty of two counts: leaving the scene of an accident and failure to promptly report an accident.

She was acquitted on a third felony charge of gross negligence. She was also convicted of misdemeanor careless driving.

Deliberation: The jury found Amy Senser guilty of two of the three counts after she fatally hit Anousone Phanthavong on August 23 last year and left the scene of the accident

Senser, 45, of Edina, showed little emotion as the verdicts were read. She stared straight ahead.

Jurors looked tense at the conclusion of the highly publicized trial, with one crying and dabbing at tears with a handkerchief.

Senser was to remain free until 
sentencing. Each felony count was punishable by up to ten years in 
prison, but sentencing guidelines suggested four years for each count.

The misdemeanor carried a potential sentence of up to 90 days in jail.

To get a conviction on the first felony 
count, the prosecution had to prove that she knew she hit a person. On 
the second count, the prosecution needed to prove that not only did she 
know she struck someone but that she failed to report it as soon as 
reasonably possible. The third requires the jury to conclude she acted 
with gross negligence, not just ordinary negligence.

Phanthavong, 38, was a chef at a Thai
restaurant near the site of the accident. His car had run out of gas 
and he had pulled to the side of the highway exit ramp.

He was filling the car's tank when he
was hit. Parts of a Mercedes were found at the scene, and authorities 
sought the public's help in finding the driver.

Nearly 24 hours later, attorney Eric 
Nelson called authorities to tell them they could pick up the vehicle 
involved at the Sensers'.

Despite giving up the vehicle, the 
Sensers didn't talk to police, fueling speculation about who was driving
and whether alcohol was involved.

It was more than a week later that Amy Senser admitted she was driving.

At trial, her stepdaughter Brittani 
testified that Amy Senser only came forward only after Brittani — angry 
that some people had speculated she was the driver — threatened to go to
authorities.

Amy Senser testified that the night 
of the crash, she went to meet her daughters and their friends at a Katy
Perry concert at St Paul's Xcel Energy Center, and had part of a glass 
of wine at a nearby restaurant before going inside.

After about 90 minutes, suffering from a headache, she left, intending to have her husband pick up the girls.

As she was driving home, she changed 
her mind and decided to return to St Paul. Shortly after turning onto a 
freeway exit ramp in a construction area in Minneapolis, Senser said she
felt a jolt at the front of her Mercedes-Benz SUV.

She said she was looking to the left at the time, and thought she had hit an orange construction barrel or a pothole.

It wasn't until the next day, when 
her husband called her outside to look at the car and the couple saw 
news reports about Phanthavong's death, that the couple called an 
attorney.

On the stand, she wept as she said she was still struggling to accept the fact that she had hit him.

Brittani Senser, left, testified that she was 
'furious' that her stepmother, Amy Senser, pictured right, had not come 
forward about driving the SUV that struck and killed a man as everyone then thought it was her

Prosecutor Deborah Russell said in 
closing arguments that Senser had to have known, and questioned whether 
Joe Senser himself believed his wife.

She reminded the jury of numerous texts Senser had deleted from her cellphone from the night of the crash and the next day.

Phanthavong's family members have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Sensers seeking more than $50,000 in damages.

Senser played four years with the Vikings in the early 1980s before a knee injury ended his career.

He co-owns Joe Senser's Restaurant 
and Sports Theater, a Minneapolis-St Paul-area restaurant chain, and has
worked as a Vikings radio color commentator.
