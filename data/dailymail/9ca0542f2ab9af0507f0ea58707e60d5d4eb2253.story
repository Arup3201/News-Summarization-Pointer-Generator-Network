Two college students were shot dead in their car as they tried to negotiate a drug deal.

Arizona State pre-med Tyler Webster, 18, and his friend 19-year-old Olek Wladyszewski were gunned down in their vehicle as they arrived to meet a dealer.

Illegal immigrant Jesus Estopellan is accused of setting up a meeting with Wladeysewski as a trap in Mesa, Arizona.

Suspect: Jesus Estopellan has been charged with first degree murder

But when he found Webster in the car as well, he gunned him down too.

The 21-year-old reportedly told detectives he wanted to make sure there were no witnesses to his crime.

The students had been friends at Red Mountain High School and hundreds of friends in Mesa, Arizona, attended a vigil for the pair after the shooting on Wednesday in the town of Mesa.

Detectives also told how Webster made a frantic 911 call as his friend lay dead in the SUV and he died from his injuries.

Webster's mother Sheila told Fox: 'He's my everything to me, everything to my life.

'He's [Estopellan] gonna have to pay for it...Just my boy's never coming home and he didn't deserve it.'

She was able to talk to her son as he lay dying in hospital.

Estopellan was yesterday charged with two counts of first degree murder.

Arizona police said they traced him through phone records of his conversations with Wladeysewski.

Detective Michael Mendez said: 'After
two days of working tirelessly.. detectives contacting people, 
conducting interviews following up on leads, they got a break in the 
case where phone records directed them to a potential suspect.'

Olek was the greatest guy who you would ever meet... he would give you the shirt off his back," says friend Alanah Fanning.

'Tyler was an awesome person. You could tell he was a good kid,' his friend Ryan Burroughs said.

Another added: 'I just want to say that he was one of my best friends here - and I don't know what to do without him.'
