Russian television presenter and opposition supporter Ksenia Sobchak has received death threats following the murder of Boris Nemtsov

A glamorous Russian television presenter and opposition campaigner - who Vladimir Putin has known since she was a child - today revealed she is facing internet threats warning she will be the next to die after slain Boris Nemtsov.

Ksenia Sobchak, 33, retweeted sickening messages, one of which warned her: 'Give up Ksenia, your death will be fast.'

The poisonous postings - which also threaten other prominent Putin foes - came after she gave a warm recollection of Mr Nemtsov, remembering how, as a child, she was taken on a sledge ride by him in Davos, Switzerland. 

Mr Nemtsov was gunned to death in the shadow of the Kremlin late on Friday.

Ms Sobchak is the daughter of Putin's political mentor, the late Anatoly Sobchak, liberal mayor of St Petersburg, the Russian President's former law professor who gave him his first political job after he quit the KGB.

For years there were rumours that she was Putin's goddaughter - and though this is not the case, many of his supporters have not forgiven her stinging and articulate opposition to his policies.

One tweet, using an insulting nickname for the TV host, posted online about Mr Nemtsov's slaying said: 'I am also very happy that there is one bastard less; when is it your turn, Horse?'

A user called Vadim, posting a picture of a man pointing a gun, and a list of six prominent opposition surnames - Nemtsov, Navalny, Sobchak, Kudrin, Kasyanov, Khodorkovsky - wrote: 'Just politics, nothing personal'.

Mr Nemtsov's name has been ticked off and Ms Sobchak's was number three on the list.

'Good News' - another user - sent Ms Sobchak a message which said: 'Give up Ksenia, your death will be fast'.

He used the hashtag: 'Death to Sobchak'.

User Unosobad posted: 'Your turn soon, Ksysha. MGER and RKSM promise it.' 

Ksysha is a fond name in Russian for Ksenia while the acronyms stand for radical groupings - the Young Squadron of United Russia, and the Russian Communist Youth Union.

Last year, Ms Sobchak claimed many well-to-do young Russians were fleeing the country because of Putin's authoritarian policies and the Ukrainian conflict.

In the wake of Mr Nemtsov's death, she warned that Putin had unleashed forces in Russia over which he now has no control.

'Actually it would be in some way less worrying if Putin had ordered Nemtsov's killing,' she wrote.

'It would be an awful system, but at least a system, a manageable system. But I feel, unfortunately, this is not the case.

'There is no Putin who gave a command to kill. But there is a Putin who has built a hellish Terminator, and he has lost control of it.'

She also warned: 'There is no one controlling the process any more - there is chaotic hatred.

'Hatred that is fuelled every day by the federal mass media.'

Of the shots that killed Mr Nemtsov, she said in her blog: 'These are only the first six bullets. There are troubled times ahead.'

In December, she bravely challenged Putin in a television press conference, quizzing him about 'fifth columnists' - groups of people who bring down a government from within.

Putin predicted that the West would use such people to undermine Russia. 'Action by a fifth column, this disparate bunch of national traitors,' he said.

Although he did not name who the 'traitors' were, Russian language sites soon suggested opposition figures including Mr Nemtsov and Ms Sobchak.

When she was called to ask a question at Putin's press conference, the president chided his press spokesman: 'Why did you give her the floor?'

Ms Sobchak told Putin: 'I would like to clarify for myself and our audience this fine line between the fifth column and the opposition.' 

She also claimed 'bullying' was again rife in Russia, as it was in her father's time, when Putin had acted to protect him.

Earlier the former IT girl told how wealthy Russians are seeking an escape route.

'This is the main society talk in good restaurants in Moscow. It is either getting citizenship, or residence permits, or the like,' she said.

Mr Nemtsov was shot dead on Friday night as he walked home with his Ukrainian model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya, 23.

She has been held under armed guard by the Russians since and has not been allowed to return to Kiev.

There are fears the Kremlin is trying to link the shooting to the conflict in Ukraine.

An estimated 70,000 marched through Moscow yesterday to mourn the fallen opposition leader and to protest against the Putin government.
