Cell phone footage has emerged appearing to show actor Dennis Quaid having a diva-esque meltdown on the set of his latest movie.

The video, which surfaced on Reddit on Monday evening, shows Quaid – famed for roles in blockbusters such as Wyatt Earp, Any Given Sunday and The Day After Tomorrow – losing the plot after someone appears to wander into his line of sight. 

'I am acting here, and this d***head wanders onto my set. I can't even get a line out until Dopey the Dick starts whispering in your ear, and you're not even watching anymore,' the 61-year-old actor screams. 

'This is the most unprofessional set I have ever been on!' Cell phone footage has emerged appearing to show actor Dennis Quaid having a diva-esque meltdown on the set of his latest movie

During the 40 seconds or so of footage Quaid, the younger brother of fellow actor Randy, calls his co-workers unprofessional, zombies and pussies. 

'This is the most unprofessional set I have ever been on. This is horse s**t!'

As one voice off camera tries to calm the actor down, Quaid yells, 'Don't f**king Dennis me' before storming off the set.

The incident is almost too good to be true and multiple commenters on Reddit have speculated that the video is a prank — specifically one orchestrated by late night host Jimmy Kimmel, who is certainly no stranger to pranks. 

One commenter, who claimed to work for Jimmy Kimmel Live, said the video is a prank, but didn't give any further details.

It's unclear what movie he's shooting ... when this rant went down, or if it's even real. The video leaked online, but his reps haven't responded to our calls for comment yet.
