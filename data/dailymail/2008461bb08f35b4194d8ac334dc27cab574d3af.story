Two protesters have been injured after the Lebanese army today opened fire on a group blocking a road in protest of the massive car bomb that rocked Beirut yesterday.

It comes as Lebanon's prime minister said today that the explosion is linked to the civil war in neighboring Syria, fuelling fears that the Syrian civil war could spill over into Lebanon.

The bomb exploded during rush hour in the mainly Christian district of Ashrafiya killed eight including a top security official, and injured nearly 100 - deadliest bombing in Beirut in four years.

Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the blast is linked to the intelligence chief's recent case, in
 which he exposed an alleged plot by Syria to sow chaos in Lebanon.

War to cross borders: There are fears that the Syrian civil war could spill over into Lebanon after a car bomb exploded in Beirut yesterday

Protesters in mostly Sunni 
areas closed roads with burning tyres and rocks in Beirut, the southern 
city of Sidon, the northern city of Tripoli and several towns in the 
eastern Bekaa Valley.

The army opened fire on a group in the village of Bar Elias in the eastern Bekaa Valley region.

A witness said: 'The Lebanese army were trying to open the road and started firing their guns.'

The government declared a national day of mourning for victims, who included Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, head of the intelligence division of Lebanon's domestic security forces. 

Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, whose government includes ministers from Hezbollah, said his government was trying to identify the perpetrators and they would be punished.

Security: The protests came as the Lebanese Cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss how to keep the peace

The Lebanese Cabinet held an emergency meeting today as the country's opposition called for Prime Minister Najib Mikati to resign. The state-run National News Agency said security commanders would attend the meeting to discuss how to keep the peace.

Iran, Syria’s most powerful regional ally, has condemned a car bomb attack in Beirut today and suggested that Israel was to blame.

A statement posted on the Iranian Foreign Ministry’s website today said: ‘This action was taken with the aim of sowing dissension among different currents and segments of the Lebanese people and was conducted by an element who has never had in mind the interests of the Lebanese people and government and who only strives for its own impure interests and goals.

‘Without a doubt the main enemy of the people of Lebanon and the region is the Zionist regime (Israel), which benefits from insecurity and instability in the region.’

The statement offered no evidence for the suggestion of Israeli involvement.

Senior Israeli official Yigal Palmor has dismissed the suggestion as ‘beyond pathetic’.

He said: ‘After the Iranian regime accused Israel of even the bad weather conditions prevailing in Iran, is there anything at all that they would not automatically blame on Israel?

‘This is beyond pathetic. It's pathological.’

Highway hindrance: The highway linking central Beirut with the city's international airport was closed due to the protests

Deadliest bomb: Police and army troops sealed off the site of Friday's blast as military intelligence agents investigated the bombing in Beirut

Many observers said the attack appeared to have links to the Syrian civil war, which has been raging for 19 months.

Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, head of the intelligence division of Lebanon's domestic security forces, who died in the blast headed an investigation over the summer that led to the arrest of former Information Minister Michel Samaha, one of Syrian President Bashar Assad's most loyal allies in Lebanon.

Samaha, who is in custody, is accused of plotting a campaign of bombings and assassinations to spread sectarian violence in Lebanon at Syria's behest. Also indicted in the August sweep was Syrian Brig. Gen. Ali Mamlouk, one of Assad's highest aides. 

Al-Hassan also played a role in the investigation of the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri with a massive truck bomb. 

A U.N.-backed tribunal has indicted four members of militant group Hezbollah, which along with its allies, now holds a majority in Lebanon's Cabinet. Hezbollah denies involvement in Hariri's killing and has refused to extradite the suspects. 

His department also had a role in breaking up several Israeli spy rings inside Lebanon over the past few years, Lebanese officials said. 

Lebanon's fractious politics are closely entwined with Syria's, sharing a web of political and sectarian ties and rivalries, often causing events on one side of the border to echo on the other. Lebanon's opposition is an anti-Syrian bloc, while the prime minister and much of the government are pro-Syrian. 

The civil war in Syria has also exposed Lebanon's sectarian tensions.

Assassin must be punished: Lebanon's top Sunni cleric, Grand Mufti Mohammed Rashid Kabbani, condemned the assassination, calling it a 'criminal explosion that targets Lebanon and its people'

Many of Lebanon's Sunni Muslims have backed Syria's mainly Sunni rebels, while Shiite Muslims have tended to back Assad. 

Al-Hassan was a Sunni whose stances were widely seen to oppose Syria and Shiite Hezbollah, the country's most powerful ally in Lebanon. 

Lebanon's top Sunni cleric, Grand Mufti Mohammed Rashid Kabbani, condemned the assassination, calling it a ‘criminal explosion that targets Lebanon and its people’. 

He called for self-restraint and that ‘the criminal will get his punishment sooner or later’. 

Police and army troops sealed off the site of Friday's blast as military intelligence agents investigated the bombing in Beirut.

Sharbal Abdo, a Beirut resident who lives down the block from where the car bomb detonated, brought his six-year-old son Chris and 12-year-old daughter Jane to see the debris today. Both children were at school when the blast ripped through the area. 

Mr Abdo said: ‘They were very afraid yesterday, and cried a lot late into the night. 

‘Today I decided to bring them here and show what happened. They need to face this situation. It may be their future.’

Rafik Khoury, editor of the independent Al-Anwar daily newspaper, said the assassination was an attempt to draw Lebanon into the conflict in Syria, which has been the most serious threat to the Assad family's 40-year dynasty. 

He wrote: ‘The side that carried the assassination knows the reactions and dangerous repercussions and is betting that it will happen. Strife is wanted in Lebanon.’

The highway linking central Beirut with 
the city's international airport was closed, as well as the highway that
 links the capital with Syria, the officials said on condition of 
anonymity in line with regulations.
