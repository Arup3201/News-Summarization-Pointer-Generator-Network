Roy Hodgson has told Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal that Wayne Rooney’s best position is to play as a striker.

Rooney, who is captain of club and country, has been forced to play in the centre of midfield 12 times under the van Gaal regime.

The England forward is just four goals away from becoming the all time leading England goalscorer. Sir Bobby Charlton currently holds the record with 49.

Hodgson said: ‘Wayne’s a goalscorer isn’t he? So one always likes to see ones goalscorers in positions where they can get into the box and in and around the box. 

‘If you’ve got several other goalscorers and you can afford to use one of your goalscorers a bit further back, that’s fine. 

‘But he’s our top goalscorer in the qualifiers, he’s just a couple of goals away now from being England’s leading goalscorer, so I hope he will continue to score goals for us.

‘We’ll only use him in the position that suits our team and I don’t know that will be centre midfield where he plays for Manchester United because they’ve got other players and that’s where they think he does the best job for him and I fully respect that.

‘At the moment I don’t necessarily think that (central midfield) will be his best position for us and I don’t have any immediate plans to play him there but who knows? I will never say never.’

Rooney scored twice against Scotland in the country’s last international and will play in his favoured position in next month’s Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania on March 27 and the friendly against Italy four days later.

Hodgson added: ‘Wayne’s the sort of player, he can play anywhere. You couldn’t surprise me if one day he played right-back and did very well. He’s a very, very good footballer.’
