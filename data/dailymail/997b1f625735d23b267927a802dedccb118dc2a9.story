Peter Schmeichel has admitted that Manchester City are now a bigger club than rivals United on form ahead of this weekend's derby match.

The former goalkeeper played for both clubs, spending eight years with United from 1991 to 1999 before finishing his career at City in the 2002-03 season.

During Schmeichel's time at Old Trafford, City played in the third tier of English football and failed to win any of the derby matches in which the Dane was between the sticks for United.

But Schmeichel, 50, now acknowledges there has been a clear shift of momentum in Manchester,

Schmeichel told BBC Sport: 'In my first couple of years (at United) I didn't understand (the rivalry with City). Liverpool and Leeds were much bigger.

'Now it's different. Man City are the champions, they had their second Premier League win last season and maybe at the moment they are a bigger club than Manchester United in terms of results so the significance has changed.

'It (the derby) is a tricky one for Manchester United because of their inconsistency.'
