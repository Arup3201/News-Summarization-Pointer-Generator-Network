Hot spots in Sydney include the Chatswood, Willoughby, St George and Fairfield, according to real estate giant Ray White. The diagram above marks out the catchment areas of the top public schools

In Brisbane, two of the top public schools are Brisbane State High School and Mansfield State High School

Victoria's top public schools include University High School, Albert Park College, McKinnon Secondary College, Balwyn High School and Glen Waverley Secondary College

In Sydney's west, properties near Westfields Sports High and the area around St George Girls High School are attracting higher price offers

Further south in Melbourne, the properties in McKinnon, Balwyn, Glen Waverley and Parkville and Albert Park are popular with parents, Domain reported.

By buying in these areas, parents are saving up to almost $500,000 by sending their children to a public school as opposed to a private school but some of these properties are priced up to $1.9 million.

Nationally, it would cost $456,933 to send a child born in 2015 to a private school but a public education would cost just $64,416, according to the Australian Scholarships Group.

The difference in fees is $469,869 in Sydney, $302,222 in Brisbane and $432,739 in Melbourne.

Sydney's North Shore has no shortage of elite schools, but Raine and Horne Chatswood/Willoughby principal Hugh Mcfarlan said it was also the prestigious public schools that were attracting parents to the area. 

He said parents were also willing to pay 5 per cent more to land a property in the catchment area of their preferred school.

'And it's not limited to owner occupiers - we get enquiries from tenants seeking a rental property within the catchment for particular schools,' Mr Mcfarlan said. 

One of the areas with a top public school is Balwyn, Victoria. This one on 20 Freeman Street has five bedrooms and six bathrooms

One of the listed features of this house by Ray White is that it is within Glen Waverley Secondary College's catchment area in Victoria

This house in Killara in New South Wales is within the catchment area of Killara High School. The price for this house is not listed but a three-bedroom penthouse in Killara is worth $1.8 million

While the area around St George Girls High School - in Sydney's south - is also attracting many buyers.

The top Australian Tertiary Admission Rank at the school was 99.95 last year.

In Sydney's west, properties near Westfields Sports High, which is Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke's alma mater, are attracting higher price offers.

Raine and Horne Fairfield's Tarek Madani said he had a lot of enquiries about homes in the area rolling in.

'Many families considering a purchase in nearby Canley Heights and Fairfield West regularly ask whether a home is in the Westfield Sports High catchment,' he said.

'Owner-occupiers are often prepared to pay up to 5 per cent more to secure a home in the Westfield High catchment, while tenants will pay a premium of up to 10 per cent to lock in a rental.'

Parkville is another suburb that has a top public school, University High School. It is priced up to $1.9 million

A property similar to this one on Wembley Grove in McKinnon, Victoria was worth $1.2 million

The trend is also happening in Brisbane, where houses around the catchment areas of Brisbane State High School and Mansfield State High School are selling fast.

LJ Hooker's Michelle Rasmussen told Daily Mail Australia said like homes around the 'prestigious North Shore schools in Sydney are sought-after, we've noticed that same sentiment increase in Brisbane'.

'Being in the catchments of the top public schools and close to the private institutions is a strong selling tool,' she said.

'Top schools rank as high on a buyer's checklist as public transport, shops, cafes and medical facilities. It's quite a common factor.'

Remax Executive Holland Park real estate agent Craig Barnes told Daily Mail Australia demand had increased in the Mansfield area in the past 18 months, with some people willing to pay 5 per cent higher than the asking price.

'Most properties I sell in that catchment is for future use of the school. Most of them are Asian or Indian background or descent who have high focus on education for their kids,' he said.

'The main difference is that we are getting multiple offers every time... and when we launch a new one we get enquiries all the time.'

Mr Barnes cited better communication tools and money saving measures as reasons why he thought more parents were turning to Mansfield State High School as a good public school alternative.

'I don't if it's because it's more publicised on the internet now. I think [Mansfield State High School] works out to be the second best public school after Brisbane State High School,' he said.

'If they can get a similar education at a public school compared to a private school, then [parents] get to save a bit of money on education.'

Meanwhile, Victorian real estate prospects are experiencing much of the same popularity in suburbs close to top performing schools.

Glen Waverley Secondary College, in Melbourne's east, is a prestigious public school and real estate agent Peter To says parents were willing to pay up to $500,000 or more for a house in a catchment area compared to one that is not.

This Highgate Hill property in Queensland is priced from a low to middle $1 million

Two apartments are available at this apartment block which overlooks Brisbane's CBD

It is conveniently located on Vulture Street, the same street Brisbane State High is located on

This house in Mansfield in Queensland is worth about $619,000 or more and inside the Mansfield State High School area

Accepting offers over $529,000, this Mansfield house is also within the high school area

The Ray White Glen Waverley area manager said the trend had been more noticeable in the past few years.

'We're getting more enquiries and people are willing to pay higher prices,' Mr To told Daily Mail Australia.

'Three years ago... the difference between home in a school zone compared to a non-school zone was $100,000, but these days it could be as much as $500,000. In other areas it could be even more.'

Mr To believed it was a combination of three things that could be driving up this trend.

'Number one is the school, number two is [parents] can save some money [for education] but it's also [because the property is] close to the shopping centre, not just the school,' he said.

'And the third is prestige. When people know you live Glen Waverley, people will probably know you're worth more money than others.'
