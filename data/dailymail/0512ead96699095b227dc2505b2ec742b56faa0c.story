Ever wondered what it would be like to be frozen inside a giant ice cube? A team of intrepid divers decided to find out and took these extraordinary pictures of their adventure.

Andrey Nekrasov, 42, joined an adventurous group who spent an hour below the frozen surface of Russia's Lake Baikal, the world's largest lake, in temperatures of -20 degrees Centigrade.

These photos, taken at up to 50ft deep under the crust of ice, show the incredible underwater world which few people have been able to witness.

Photographer Andrey Nekrasov, 42, took the plunge and dived into the 2,500ft deep frozen lake to take these incredible images

The divers prepare to enter Lake Baikal. Andrey travelled more than 3,000 miles by plane from his home in Odessa in the Ukraine to Siberia

Despite surface temperatures of minus 20-degrees Centigrade at this time of year the divers spent around an hour in the water

In spite of the freezing temperatures, Lake Bailkal is a wildlife haven and home to 1,700 species of plants and wildlife

The lake lake is the largest in the world, it has five-times the volume of all five Great Lakes of North America.

Despite surface temperatures of minus 20
 degrees Centigrade at this time of year, the 12,200 square mile 
Siberian UN Heritage Site of Lake Bailkal is a wildlife haven - home to 
1,700 species of plants and animals.

Andrey
 travelled over 3,000 miles by plane from his home in Odessa in the 
Ukraine to the town of Ulan Ude in Siberia. He then journeyed the final 
eight miles across frozen tundra to reach the lake.
