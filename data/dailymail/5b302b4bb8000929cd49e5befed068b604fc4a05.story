Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will tie the knot with actress Cheryl Hines tomorrow - despite the persistent rumors of his infidelity.

In front of a crowd including matriach Ethel Kennedy, RFK Jr. and Cheryl will say I Do at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass.

Today, Kennedy's cousin Patrick Kennedy, a former congressman, confirmed the wedding is planned for Saturday afternoon at Ethel's home, and said many members of the family are planning to attend.

The wedding comes just weeks after MailOnline told how it was alleged that RFK Jr. nicknamed Bobby, had a two-year affair with Connecticut socialite Chelsea Kirwan - but revealed that the couple would still go ahead with the ceremony.

This will be the third marriage for Bobby, the son of the late senator Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the late Senator Edward Kennedy.

The 60-year-old activist and his 48-year-old fiancee, best known for playing Larry David's wife on HBO hit Curb Your Enthusiasm and ABC comedy Suburgatory, have recently had an offer accepted on a $5million Malibu property - meaning Bobby may make the move from his home in Bedford, Connecticut to the West Coast.

This is believed to be Bobby's way of showing his commitment to Cheryl following claims that he had cheated on her.

While rumors had been swirling, Bobby's children are extremely fond of Cheryl and speaking at a movie screening last week, his daughter Kathleen 'Kick' Kennedy told the Daily News: 'It’s great (that they’re marrying). I love Cheryl, and I’m excited for our new family.'

The budding actress revealed the couple had been disorganized, admitting: 'I’m trying to help the best I can.

'It's a fun wedding with two very fun people who aren’t necessarily always very organized. So I try to be there to pull everything together when I can. Maybe I’m a digit above everyone else (with organization) or something.'

And she revealed that Cheryl had not even made her final choice of gown yet.

However, Bobby could still be drawn into Chelsea Kirwan's bitter divorce from surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan as the mother-of-four faces a deposition and will likely be asked about her relationship with the Kennedy scion.

Despite everything, the couple put on a display of intimacy when pictured in the Hamptons on July 4 - even wearing what looked like wedding rings, even though they have not yet said 'I Do'.

On Monday, they were spotted at the John F. Kennedy Museum gift shop in Hyannis to buy gifts for the bridal party.

And they have reserved a block of rooms at the Hyannis Harbor hotel for their guests. The hotel is a 500-room venue that lies on the ocean -and is booked out over this weekend.

Meanwhile, photographer Dennis Reggie today tweeted: 'Honored to photograph another Kennedy family wedding this coming weekend in Hyannis Port. Bride is the gorgeous Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl Hines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the groom.

'Hard to believe but this makes over 25 Kennedy family wedding assignments over the years...can't wait.'

Robert Kennedy Jr, 60, is set to marry Curb Your Enthusiasm star Hines, 48, at his mother Ethel Kennedy's home in Hyannis Port tomorrow

Bobby has previously been married to Ruth Black, the mother of his children Robert Kennedy III and Kathleen, from 1984 to 1994 and then Mary Richardson, between 1994 and 2012.

Mary, with whom Bobby had children Conor, Kyra, William and Aiden, committed suicide at her Bedford, New York, home  in May 2012. She was 52.

In May 2010, Bobby filed for divorce from Mary after 16 years of marriage. Details of their divorce filing were kept private.

In the past few weeks, alleged details of Bobby's private life have surfaced as he prepares to wed Cheryl.

The  New York Post
 has revealed that the environmental lawyer and activist, who works for Pace University and Riverkeeper, had contact 
details for 43 suspected mistresses stored in his cell phone

It was reported he kept a list of dozens of 
women filed under the letter ‘G’ in his cell phone, including both 
Cheryl Hines and Chelsea Kirwan..

The
 Post reported that Bobby's late wife, Mary told a friend 
about the list just two months before she committed suicide.

She is understood to have believed he had stored the names under ‘G’ because of the Italian slang for mistress - ‘goomah’.

When RFK Jr had contact details for several women with the same first name, he would distinguish them by listing either their profession or city.

His list included at least five women from Toronto and other in Paris, Palm Beach, Florida, and Aspen, Colorado.

The Post contacted several women on the list, some of whom confirmed that they had met Kennedy.

One described him as a ‘big flirt', while another described him as a ‘charming and talented man’, but denied that they had ever been romantically involved.

This isn't the first time that details about RFK Jr's philandering has emerged. A 2001 diary belonging to him surfaced last September which helped gave a stunning insight into the number of affairs he had carried out during the same year that wife Mary had given birth to their fourth child.

Bobby used a section at the back of his diary, headed ‘cash accounts,’ to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a mark out of ten.

The list contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside them - which is believed to have signified that they had full intercourse.

Alongside more prosaic details of Bobby's political activism and family life, there are startling admissions of his own feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on his wife.

The 48-year-old actress and 60-year-old environmental activist took part in Fourth Of July celebrations in the Hamptons and didn't try to hide their gold bands ahead of their wedding this month

Time and again he wrote of how he felt tortured by his ‘lust demons’ as he described them. 

On days when he didn’t cheat, Bobby wrote ‘victory’ to signify that he had resisted sexual temptation.

‘I’m
 like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. 
But the fruit is all I want,’ he wrote on Nov. 5, 2001.

The thick, red journal was found at one stage by his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, who, distraught over their impending divorce and her husband's serial philandering, hanged herself in May 2012.

The diary later found its way into the hands of the New York Post. When a Post reporter questioned Kennedy about the diary they were first met with a stunned silence before he denied having kept a diary during that year.

‘I don’t think there is any way you could have a diary or journal of mine from 2001,’ said Kennedy. ‘I don’t have any comment on it. I have no diary from 2001.’
