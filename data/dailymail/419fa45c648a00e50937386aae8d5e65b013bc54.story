America's Next Top Model host and mentor Tyra Banks said she was 'deeply saddened' about the death of one of her former contestants last week, but plenty of others have had similarly tragic fates after the cameras stopped rolling. 

From rehab to felonies, several contestants fell into lives of crime after being dismissed from the show. While some picked themselves back up, others weren't as lucky.  

Cycle 21 contestant Mirjana Puhar, 19, was shot dead last week after she opened the door to two robbers who also killed  two men inside the house.

Mirjana Puhar was an America's Next Top Model contestant during Cycle 21. She was shot dead last week as she opened up her door to two robbers who went on to shoot two men in her house in a triple homicide

Mirjana's boyfriend, Jonathan Alvarado, 23, and his roommate, Jusmar Gonzaga-Garcia, 21, were also killed in the shooting. It is believed that the homicide was 'drug related'

Her boyfriend, Jonathan Alvarado, 23, and his roommate, Jusmar Gonzaga-Garcia, 21, were the other two victims of the triple homicide. 

Police arrested and charged Emmanuel Jesus Rangel, 19, with three counts of first-degree murder.

Authorities recovered seven rounds of 9mm ammunition, two knives, drugs, a safety deposit box and several cell phones which has led police to believe the house may have been a drug den.

The police report, seen by Daily Mail Online, shows they also found a marijuana-like substance.

Detectives confirmed the triple homicide was 'drug related' and are looking into the backgrounds of the two male victims.

Cycle eight finalist Renee Alway - known as Renee DeWitt on the show - was arrested in Palm Springs, California, in June 2013 after a six-hour standoff with the police and SWAT team following a robbery spree, according to AOL.  

Neighbors told officers the residents were out of the country and Alway was found hiding in the garage allegedly armed with a gun, police said. 

Alway, who was 20 when she was on the show, reached the final three contestants before taking part in Tyra Banks' show 'Modelville' and appearing in ads and magazines.

But in the months afterwards, she found 'closed door, after closed door, after closed door, and it was just really hard to take', she said in an interview.

After the 2013 incident, she was as sentenced to 12 years in prison for four felony burglary counts and one count each of vehicle theft and being a felon in possession of a firearm. She was also ordered to pay $58,679.58 in damages to her victims.

Alway, now 28, gave up custody of her three children before the arrest.

Angelea Preston, pictured in 2010 on left and 2013 on right,  was a contest on Cycle 14 of the show. She later returned for the All Star season, and made it to the finale. She was kicked off before the winner was announced, however, after producers found out she worked as a paid escort prior to filming the season

Cycle 14 contestant Angelea Preston returned for an all-stars season for the show in Cycle 17, but was kicked off after making the final three. 

Show producers revealed that she had been working as a paid escort prior to filming the 17th season. 

In December, however, it was Preston announced she was suing Tyra Banks for $3million, claiming she was improperly denied a top prize.

City News Service says Preston filed the breach-of-contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court.

Preston said she should have won and that she was wrongly disqualified because she had worked as an escort before taking part in the show.

Another cycle eight contestant, Jael Strauss, spent six years after appearing on the show desperate and homeless struggling with a drug addiction. In 2012 she agreed to go to rehab.

Then 28, she was battling a life-threatening addiction to methamphetamine, an addiction to cocaine and painkiller abuse. She was stripping to make money.

Close to losing her battle with addiction, Dr Phil staged an intervention with Strauss in what was a last-ditch effort to help the once aspiring model save her own life.

After 'the full blown meth addict' initially resisted all help, running off the stage and out onto the Paramount lot in tears, Dr Phil finally convinced her to seek the treatment she needed.

Now, according to Strauss's Facebook page, she's working at a rehab facility in Texas. 

Lisa D'Amato, pictured in 2005 on left and 2013 on right, entered Dr Drew's Celebrity Rehab in 2010. She later went on to get married and have a baby boy

She declined sober living after treatment, but agreed to meetings and won America's Next Top Model All Stars season, cycle 17 in 2011. 

She got married and had a baby boy in September 2013, who the couple named Daxel Vaughn.
