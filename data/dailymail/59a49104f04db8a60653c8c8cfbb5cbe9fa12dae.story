Pennsylvania's attorney general has blamed a former female prison worker for her own rape after she was attacked in jail by a dangerous criminal. 

The 24-year-old victim was attacked by Omar Best inside Rockview Prison, Pennsylvania. During her 27-minute long ordeal, Best strangled his victim until she was unconscious before raping her. 

CCTV footage showed that Best left the room where the attack occurred of his own accord. Prison staff later found the victim unconscious on the floor.

The victim is suing the state and the former prison superintendent for damages. However, in response to the claim, the attorney general's office filed a 13-page document citing 'contributory negligence' on behalf of the victim. 

Best, 36, was jailed for life following the attack. He was in prison serving a rape sentence at the time of the attack and had an earlier conviction for attempted rape from 1996 which had been reduced to indecent assault.  

The victim's lawyer, Clifford Rieders, of Williamsport, criticised the tactic on Wednesday.

He said: 'It's total bunk. It's throwing something out there so they can have it on the record. They have no evidence of that.'

'It has no substance, but it's just the way some lawyers litigate. 

He added that it's 'insulting to women generally who face rape cases only to be told that it's their fault'. 

According to testimony at Best's trial and her suit, the rape victim was hired to work in the prison's central office on June 10, 2013.

By mid-July she had told prison officials that inmates sometimes entered hallways and stairs that led to her office and, specifically, that she was uncomfortable when Best entered her office. 

Though Best wasn't specifically assigned to work there, he would sometimes enter to empty the trash before he finally raped her on July 25, 2013.

According to court documents filed by Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane: 'Some or all of the damages plaintiff have alleged are in part, or substantially due, to the acts of third parties other than the answering defendants, and/or plaintiff acted in a manner which in whole or in part contributed to the events which led to the damages plaintiff has alleged in her complaint.'

Best was jailed for life on September 12 under the three-strike rule. 

According to the Centre Daily Times, Best's criminal history went back 23 years, including several violent attacks against women. 

The victim's lawsuit claims that Best had been transferred to Rockview after assaulting a female prison worker at another institution.
