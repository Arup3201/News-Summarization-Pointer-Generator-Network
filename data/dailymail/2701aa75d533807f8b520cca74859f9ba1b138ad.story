Local police are searching the Surrey home of the two girls orphaned in the Alps massacre in an attempt to find out who was behind the fatal shootings. 

French prosecutors have also confirmed in a press conference this afternoon that all four victims were shot twice in the head, and that all immediate family members, including Saad Al-Hilli's brother will be questioned.

Two relatives of the Al-Hilli family have gone to France, alongside a British social worker to visit the two girls, Zeena and Zainab, who are under police supervision.

Public prosecutor Eric Maillaud said the identities of the
relatives who had arrived in France would not be made public for 'security
reasons'.

There was confusion yesterday as no 
relatives had presented themselves to the authorities to care for the 
girls, who were being looked after by British consular staff and nurses.

However it is unclear when they would be able to see the elder girl, Zainab, as she continues to be treated in hospital.

Officers from Surrey Police erected a tent at the front of the al-Hillis' house today as they prepare to conduct a search of the property with the French police team, led by officer Marc de Tarle.

The caravan which the family had been
staying in at the Le Solitaire du Lac campsite in Saint-Jorioz was also removed
by police.

A team of four French officers has 
travelled to the UK to work with British detectives at the house of Saad
 al-Hilli in Claygate, Surrey.

Four-year-old Zeena Al-Hilli – who 
cowered under her mother’s skirt as bullets riddled the family car – has
 spoken to police about the bloodbath.

 elder sister, seven-year-old Zainab, remains in an artificial coma and 
is seen by police as the key to learning what happened.

Their uncle and closest living relative, Zaid Al-Hilli, 53, is being questioned in London today over an alleged feud between him and the girls’ murdered father over an inheritance rumoured to be worth anything up to £1million, police said.

The desperate plight of the two little girls left alive emerged as it was also revealed that:

Iraq-born aerospace engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife Ikbal, 47, and his 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law were killed by a hail of gunfire while in their BMW on holiday in the French Alps.

Local cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, a father-of-three, was shot dead after disturbing the killing spree, and was hit by five bullets.

Speaking about the children yesterday, Mr Maillaud added there had been much discussion about who will look after the orphans.

Mr Maillaud said he hoped Zainab – who suffered a fractured skull and a bullet in the shoulder – could rebuild her life.

'It is a miracle the girl didn't get a bullet through her head and we feel that she may be able to start her life again,' he said.

'We're hoping the little girl will talk at length. It's awful for a little girl to be a key witness, because she will have to talk about her own suffering, but she's seven and seven is the age of reason, sometimes. She can tell the colour of skin, the colour of clothes, and other information we need.'

When asked if their uncle Zaid had offered to be the children's guardian, M. Maillaud replied: 'Not to my knowledge.'

Zainab, seven, was shot in the shoulder and beaten 'savagely' about the head. She is in a medically induced coma in Grenoble University Hospital and police are awaiting permission to question her.

Her sister was unharmed and found so well hidden next to her mother and grandmother's body that it took police eight hours to find her.

Delayed reaction: Several hours after police arrived on scene, Mr Al-Hilli's four-year-old daughter Zeena was found alive huddling under her mother's legs inside the car

Yesterday, Mr Maillaud said Zeena had
 identified her family, and described what he called the 'fury' and 
'terror' of the attack to French police.

But
 he added that because she hid behind her mother and grandmother's 
skirts when the gunfire began she did not see anything important.

'This
 is a little girl who must be protected,' he said. 'She should go back 
to the UK soon so that she can try and forget this nightmare.'

The
 prosecutor said: 'We asked her, “Who were you with?”, and she said 
first, “With my dad”, and she gave a name, “With my sister”, she gave a 
name, “My mother”.

'The
 little girl said, talking like a little girl does, she didn't know [the
 Swedish woman] very well. We have to assess very clearly, who was that 
lady with the Swedish passport?'

Police believe this woman was the girl's maternal grandmother.

French
 and British police are waiting for the go-ahead from medical staff at 
the hospital to talk to Zainab, who was hit with 'tremendous ferocity'.

Mr
 Maillaud said detectives hope the girl, who is in a stable condition, 
will recover sufficiently from the trauma to speak to them and that her 
memory was not damaged. He said: 'We are waiting for the ballistic 
team's report and, when possible, a hearing with the eldest girl.

'Maybe she can give us information on the number of people present for example, or the colour of their skin, and other elements of description that might allow us to consider a bit more seriously a first lead.'

On Thursday, some 12 gendarmes stood guard at the hospital alongside a number of security guards. Yesterday, there were no gendarmes, just two security guards.
