David Cameron hailed Margaret Thatcher as ‘the patriot Prime Minister’ with a ‘lionhearted love for this country’ last night as he led tributes to the woman hailed as Britain’s greatest peacetime leader.

Mr Cameron, speaking on the steps of 10 Downing Street said the country had lost a ‘great leader, a great Prime Minister and a great Briton’.

Old colleagues and former foes alike united to acknowledge her position as the most towering political figure since Sir Winston Churchill, a pioneer as the first women prime minister and an international champion of free market economics.

Mr Cameron cut short a trip to Europe to return to London following the news and said Parliament would be recalled from recess tomorrow so politicians could pay tribute.

He said: ‘Margaret Thatcher didn’t just lead our country – she saved our country. And we should never forget that the odds were stacked against her. She was the shopkeeper’s daughter from Grantham who made it to the highest office in the land.

‘There were people who said she couldn’t make it; who stood in her way; who said a woman couldn’t lead. She defied them all.

‘She will be remembered for the big political battles she fought. Taking on the union barons. Privatising industry. Unleashing enterprise. Rescuing the economy. Letting people buy their council homes.

‘Winning the Falklands War. Strengthening our defences. Helping to win the Cold War. Margaret Thatcher took a country that was on its knees and made Britain stand tall again.’

Mr Cameron said it could not be denied that Lady Thatcher ‘divided opinion’.

‘But if there is one thing that cuts through all of this – one thing that runs through everything she did – it was her lionhearted love for this country. She was the patriot Prime Minister and she fought for Britain’s interests every single step of the way.

‘Margaret Thatcher loved this country and served it with all she had.

The big beasts of Lady Thatcher’s Cabinets joined in paying tribute yesterday.

Lord Tebbit, former Tory Party chairman said: ‘It is a sadness that such an immense figure of the late 20th century should have gone – but perhaps a merciful release for her, from a life which must have been increasingly empty in recent years.

‘She did indeed change Britain for the
 better – would that there was somebody like her to lead us again now! I
 am grateful to her for allowing me to serve her country in that way.’

Sir John Major,
 Lady Thatcher’s successor, said: ‘In government, the UK was turned 
around under – and in large measure because of – her leadership. Her 
reforms of the economy, trades union law, and her recovery of the 
Falkland Islands elevated her above normal politics, and may not have 
been achieved under any other leader.

‘Her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.’

Lord Heseltine, Cabinet minister and rival, said: ‘I am sorry to learn of Lady Thatcher’s death. The illness of her last years has been cruel and very difficult.’

Lord Lawson, her former Chancellor said: ‘Britain seemed doomed to continual economic decline. She changed all that and her tax reforms were emulated around the world. She did not surround herself with Yes-men but people who shared her ideas to rescue the economy.

‘I don’t want to be drawn on the difficulties at the end. I want to focus on the enormous achievement of her first ten years.’

Lord Howe,
 former Foreign Secretary, whose resignation speech led to Lady 
Thatcher’s downfall, commented: ‘Britain, when we came to office, was in
 the last chance saloon. People realised that we really had to do some 
rather difficult things.’  Asked about his personal relationship with 
her, he replied: ‘It was all a long time ago.’

Lord Saatchi,
 chairman of Centre for Policy Studies, set up by Lady Thatcher in 1974,
 declared: ‘Everyone wants to be immortal. Few are. Mrs Thatcher is. 
Why? Because her values are timeless, eternal.

‘She
 developed all the winning arguments of our time – free markets, low 
tax, a small state, independence, individuality, self-determination. The
 result was a revolution in economic policy and three election victories
 in a row.’

Lord Lamont,
 another former chancellor, said: ‘The name Margaret Thatcher will 
always be synonymous with the word “courage”. The word impossible barely
 existed for her. We shall not see her like again.’

Kenneth Clarke,
 now Minister without portfolio and one of Lady Thatcher’s Cabinet, 
said: ‘It was conviction politics. She had a strong idea of what she 
wanted to do and it was based on what she thought was the right thing to
 do.’

Lord Patten, former cabinet minister, now chairman of the BBC Trust, said: ‘She made Britain governable again. We should all recognise her huge contribution to the history and well-being of this country.’

Respect: Tony Blair (pictured yesterday in Pennsylvania), who Lady Thatcher once described as her 'greatest achievement', was by far the warmest of senior Labour figures, hailing her as a 'towering political figure'

Lord Archer,
 former Tory deputy chairman, said: ‘The thing that always stands out is
 her extreme loyalty. She never forgot her friends, ever. She loved this
 country so dearly and was steely in her determination to see it great 
again. And that is what she did.’

Justin Welby,
 the Archbishop of Canterbury, noted Lady Thatcher’s religious faith. 
‘It is right that today we give thanks for a life devoted to public 
service, acknowledging also the faith that inspired and sustained her,’ 
he said.

Tony Blair,
 who Lady Thatcher once described as her ‘greatest achievement’, was by 
far the warmest of senior Labour figures, hailing her as a ‘towering 
political figure’.

‘Very few leaders get to change not only the political landscape of their country but of the world. Margaret was such a leader. Her global impact was vast.

'And some of the changes she made in Britain were, in certain respects at least, retained by the 1997 Labour government, and came to be implemented by governments around the world,’ he said.

‘As a person she was kind and generous spirited and was always immensely supportive to me as Prime Minister although we came from opposite sides of politics.’

Thoughts: Ed Miliband (pictured yesterday in Ipswich, Suffolk) said she would 'remain a controversial figure'

Ed Miliband, Labour leader, said she would ‘always remain a controversial figure’.

But he added: ‘She will be remembered as a unique figure. She reshaped the politics of a whole generation. She was Britain’s first woman Prime Minister. She moved the centre ground of British politics and was a huge figure on the world stage.’

Gordon Brown, who angered some Labour MPs when he invited Lady Thatcher for tea in Number Ten, hailed her ‘many decades of service’.

‘She will be remembered not only for being Britain’s first female Prime Minister and holding the office for 11 years, but also for the determination and resilience with which she carried out all her duties throughout her public life.’

Boris Johnson, London Mayor, said Lady Thatcher had ‘ended the defeatism and pessimism of the post-war period and unleashed a spirit of enterprise’.

‘She fought against the clubby, cosy, male-dominated consensus of both main parties – and she won.’
