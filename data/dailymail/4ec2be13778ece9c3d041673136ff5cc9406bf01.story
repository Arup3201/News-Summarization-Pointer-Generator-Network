If you're going to fight with your girlfriend, don't do it in a basketball stadium — the kiss cam might catch you.

A couple of Celtics fans were caught in a hilarious argument at the United Center in Chicago Saturday night.

The fight appears to start when the man won't get off his cell phone to give his lady a smooch even as the kiss cam closes in on them.

Before the storm: the couple is first spotted on the kiss cam at the United Center in Chicago, and she does not look happy about his man's lack of attention

She punches him on the arm, pointing to the kiss cam, and they launch into an argument — as the entire stadium watches

She punches and slaps his arm to get his attention — and the two launch into an argument.

Then Chicago mascot Benny the Bull shows up and steals the scene.

He picks up the woman in his arms and carries her away while the stadium erupts in applause.

No word yet if the scene, which was posted on YouTube, was a marketing stunt.

The Celtics lost to the Bulls, 104-109.
