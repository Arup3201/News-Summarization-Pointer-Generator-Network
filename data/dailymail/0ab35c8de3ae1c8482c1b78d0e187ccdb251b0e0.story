Victim: The unnamed woman says she was raped by Jimmy Savile when she was a 16-year-old virgin

A woman has told how she became pregnant after Jimmy Savile lured her to a hotel room and raped her when she was a 16-year-old virgin.

Now 65, she recalled the ‘shame’ of being taken to a doctor by her mother to have an illegal abortion, without painkillers, and spent two years paying back her grandmother for the cost of the procedure.

She met Savile in 1963 when she was invited to speak on Radio Luxembourg, for which he was a DJ, about her Elvis Presley fan club.

He told her he was going to meet Elvis the following month and asked her to give him a photograph of herself that he could show The King.

The teenager obliged and was delighted when, upon his return, Savile phoned her home to invite her to his London hotel because he had a gift to give her ‘from Elvis’.

The junior secretary walked to his Russell Square hotel after work, feeling ‘as if I had died and gone to heaven because I was about to speak to a man who had met Elvis’.

Breaking a 50-year silence, she said: ‘You can’t imagine how excited I was to find out what Elvis had said to him.

‘His room was on the ground floor right next to the reception, and when I knocked on the door, he answered in his pyjamas.

‘The only man I had ever seen in his pyjamas was my father so I was quite surprised.

‘As soon as I got inside he pinned me against the wall and started kissing me hard.

‘I said “stop, stop”. He was trying to encourage me not to struggle and saying, “you’re an angel”.

‘I wanted to shout but I was too embarrassed. I didn’t want anyone to know what was happening.’

She described how he forced her on to the bed and raped her. The pretty blonde teenager weighed just six-and-a-half stone.

She said: ‘I couldn’t stop him. I was telling him it hurt. I was holding my body so tight to try to stop him, but he was so heavy, he was too strong.

‘Afterwards he said to me “you’re all right now”, as if he had done me a favour.’

Savile
 got dressed and, shortly after, a male friend of the star knocked on 
the door. He opened it and the man looked straight at her, lying in the 
bed frozen with terror.

‘He 
asked Jimmy if he was ready to go for dinner and Jimmy turned and asked 
me if I wanted to join them. I shook my head and he left,’ she said.

Tricked: The woman, pictured at another photoshoot aged 17, says she was lured to Jimmy Savile's hotel room by the prospect of gifts from her idol Elvis

Savile left three badges on the dressing table for her, apparently from Elvis. They said ‘I’m a kissin’ cousin’, a reference to the film he appeared in. She still has them today.

‘I had to get the train home and I was worried people could tell,’ she said. ‘I was late home for tea, but I had to pretend everything was normal.’

She missed her next two periods and, suspecting she was pregnant, took the day off work and tried to induce a miscarriage.

Her parents realised something was wrong and her mother asked whether she was pregnant.

‘I told her I thought I was,’ she said. ‘They knew it was Jimmy because he called the house the same week to speak to me. My mum told him I was pregnant and he said “it’s not possible”. Those were his words. He didn’t call again.’

The woman recalls her father, a plumber, ‘crying in the front room’ during this time. ‘For his daughter to have gone through that, it was hard for him,’ she said.

‘My mum was raised by strict Victorian parents and she was less emotional and more practical about it.’

She took her daughter to their local 
GP on a Sunday morning when the surgery was usually closed. The doctor 
was known to carry out abortions illegally for women in the area. The 
Abortion Act was not passed until four years later, in 1967, allowing 
terminations to be carried out by registered practitioners.

The doctor was paid £150 by the family – the equivalent of £2,200 today.

She was given no painkillers and describes gripping the sides of the bed in agony during the procedure.

Painful debt: She was forced to have an abortion, borrowing £150 from her grandmother. Despite this horrific incident, however, she went on to have a modelling career - and later married and has three children

‘The worst bit was that we couldn’t afford the abortion so my nan had to lend us the money. I paid it back in instalments for the next two years out of my secretary wages,’ she said. ‘We were a close family and I had had the most lovely, innocent childhood, so it was hard for my parents.

‘I never even thought to report it. We were a little family from Essex. He was Jimmy Savile. After the abortion, we never spoke about it again.’ Her parents have since passed away.

A year later, aged 17, she was scouted by a modelling agency  and began to do catalogue work, including for Marks & Spencer and Gillette razors.

By chance, when she was 23, she met her attacker again when she was picked by a modelling agency to dance and stand behind the DJs presenting Top Of The Pops.

She said: ‘I was excited to be on the show and wore black satin hot pants. I thought it would be good for my modelling career. But when I got there and they told me it was Jimmy Savile, I felt sick.

‘I told myself he wouldn’t recognise me, but he turned around and noticed me. But then he said, “It’s you, it’s angel”. I didn’t say anything. He looked a bit taken aback and I was pleased by that. I was older and he couldn’t hurt me.’

The woman has since married and has three children and several grandchildren.

She has bravely agreed to release photographs of herself as a teenager, to show how she looked when Savile assaulted her – but she wishes to remain anonymous because she has never told her children what happened.

Tragically, she suffered several miscarriages in her 20s and ‘always wondered if it was because of what they did to me when I had the abortion’.

She says she was also faced with seeing and hearing her attacker wherever she went – on the television, on the radio and in print. Savile’s career peaked in the 1970s and he fronted several prime-time shows.

She said: ‘I couldn’t watch him when he came on the television. I had to leave the room. It wasn’t Jimmy Savile to me, it was the man who had forced himself on me and it brought it all back when I saw his face.’

When he died, she said she was ‘sickened’ by all the tributes.

‘I was angry that everyone kept saying how great he was.’ Now, she says she wants to see him stripped of his knighthood posthumously.

She said: ‘When it started to come out that he had attacked other girls I felt relieved. You think it is just you and something you did to make it happen.

‘I want people to know what he was really like. I want justice to be done and for people to know the truth.’ She married her husband in the 1980s and has three children. She continued to work as a secretary for several years before becoming a full-time mother and housewife.

The woman, who lives in a smart detached house, confided in her husband about the rape, but kept it from friends and family.

She said: ‘I tried to bury it in my mind, but it was always there.’
