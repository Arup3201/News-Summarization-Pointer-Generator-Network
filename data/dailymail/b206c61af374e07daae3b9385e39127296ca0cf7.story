A  man wanted by police made a couple of critical mistakes that led to his capture - he sent out Snapchat messages pinpointing his location.

The Somerset County Sheriff's Office had been looking for Christopher Wallace, of Fairfield, Maine for several weeks in connection with a burglary in January.

Police told the Morning Sentinel that on Sunday night they received tips from people who said Wallace, 24, had posted on Snapchat that he had returned to his Fairfield home. 

Snapped up: Wanted man Christopher Wallace was caught by police on Sunday at his home in Maine after posting messages on Snapchat which pinpointed his location  

The Somerset County Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook on Monday: 'Over the past few weeks, since our press release looking for the public's assistance in locating him, Mr Wallace had become cocky. Which led to his downfall. This is where our story picks up.

'Using the Snapchat app, Wallace posted that he was at his house in Fairfield, which prompted people to call the Sheriff's Office.'

Erika Hall, 20, was also arrested for hindering the police search for Wallace

Police went to the house. While they were searching with permission of the resident, they were tipped off that Wallace had posted a new Snapchat message saying police were in the house looking for him and he was hiding in a cabinet.  

Police wrote: 'A search of the kitchen cabinets turned up some food, some pots and pans, and also a pair of feet. 

'The pair of feet just so happened to be attached to a person, and that person was Christopher Wallace.

The police added: 'He was removed from the cabinet, and placed under arrest. All of that, brings me to the moral of the story. Always remain humble, my friends.'

Erika Hall, 20, was also arrested for hindering apprehension.

The sheriff's office wrote on Facebook: 'Let's put it this way, when the police ask you multiple times if someone is in the house, and you answer repeatedly that they are not in the house, and that you have not seen said person in ''weeks'', you're just going to get arrested. That's how it happens.'
