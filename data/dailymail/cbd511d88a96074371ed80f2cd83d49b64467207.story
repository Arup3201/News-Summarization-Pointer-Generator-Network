The man who set out to conquer Kilimanjaro with a nine-foot cuddly tiger strapped to his back has reached the highest peak in Africa.

Paul Goldstein hauled the 30lb beast to an altitude of 19,341ft - just a few days after the two of them completed last Sunday's Brighton marathon.

And as if that weren't enough, the 49-year-old is now preparing to carry his feline friend across the finish line in the London marathon tomorrow.

Mr Goldstein, a wildlife photographer and tour guide from Wimbledon, battled through heavy snow in the final stretch towards the Uhuru peak.

His trio of gruelling feats forms a fundraising campaign to help save central India's Bengal tiger population.

After a long descent on Thursday, he said: 'The Siberian Tiger is a sub species - however, yesterday some of that cold-weather tiger's DNA was in evidence on Kilimanjaro. In the worst conditions that anybody had ever experienced, the tiger summited.'

He was due to fly back from Africa today to tackle the final stage of his three-part charity challenge.

With his Worth More Alive III campaign, Mr Goldstein is hoping to raise more than £25,000 for Friends of Conservation, a charity which works with communities around the world to protect endangered species and habitats.

Mr Goldstein, who ran four marathons in one week two years ago, had to complete the Brighton race in less than six-and-a-half hours to catch his flight to Africa.

Having crossed the line after less than six hours last Sunday, he was whisked to Heathrow, where he jetted off to Tanzania to begin the five-day ascent of the world's highest free-standing mountain.

The proceeds will go towards conservation projects in India's Bandhavgarh National Park.

Mr Goldstein said hunters poach tigers for medicine and to profit from sales of their fur, teeth and claws, while the species is also losing its natural habitat due to industry destroying the forests where they live.

He said: 'Using tigers in traditional medicine is sheer lunacy. It has no value in any shape or form.

'Tigers could become extinct, but if we act now these beautiful animals are a species that can definitely be saved.'

While there were around 100,000 
tigers in the wild a century ago, their numbers have plummeted due to 
poaching and loss of habitat and there are now thought to be as few as 
3,500 left.

One of the most important aspects of 
the charity's work is to educate local people about the plight of 
endangered animals and to stop predators such as tigers simply being 
seen as the enemy.

Mr Goldstein has raised £80,000 for 
the cause previously, and all the money raised in his latest challenge 
will go towards a compensation war chest for local farmers who have lost
cattle to the big cats.

The value of a dead tiger is around 
£12,000, according to the charity, but the value of a living tigress has
been calculated as £70 million in the revenue it will bring to a 
reserve or park such as Bandhavgarh.
