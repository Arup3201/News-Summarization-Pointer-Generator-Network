A mother whose son was apparently picked up by his kindergarten teacher by his neck has said the educator should have been fired.

Autumn Nelson said she was shocked when she saw surveillance footage of the incident at Riverdale School in Mt. Blanchard, Ohio, which shows teacher Barb Williams apparently grabbing her son, Ian.

'I was crying,' she told the Today show as she became emotional. 'It broke my heart to see my child get harmed by a complete stranger.

'They should have fired her when they found out about the whole situation, that she put her hands on him.'

Emotional: Autumn Nelson said she burst into tears when she saw her son Ian, pictured with her husband Anthony, being picked up by his kindergarten teacher in surveillance footage

Innocence: Ian described the moment that his teacher grabbed him 'hard' as his mother became emotional

Instead of firing the teacher, who has been with the school district for 14 years, school officials placed her on unpaid leave for 10 days. It will come to an end as the school begins its summer vacation.

It is still not clear why she was angry at the boy, who was coming out of the bathroom.

Williams is seen on surveillance footage appearing to confront Ian. As the little boy walks out of the bathroom, Williams allegedly grabs him and lifts Ian in front of a wall.

The teacher then appears to grab him by the throat, tilting his head back and forcing him off his feet.

Shocking: Surveillance footage at Riverdale 
School in Ohio show's six-year-old Ian Nelson's head being tipped back 
as his kindergarten teacher, Barb Williams, appears to lift him off the ground

Anger: It is not clear what led Williams to pick up the boy and shake him before speaking into his face

In another shot, Williams appears to have grabbed the boy's shirt and used that to lift the terrified boy off the ground.

'She did this to me - hard,' Ian told the Today show as he grabbed his shirt.

Action: Kindergarten teacher Barb Williams has been suspended without pay for ten days

His parents told the Toledo News that they were stunned by

'We thought it was just a little incident that happened.That's what the school made it sound like. All of a sudden, we get this video today and this is just outrageous,' Anthony Nelson said.

The incident came to light when a member of staff at Riverdale Schools in Hancock County reported Williams.

Seeing
 the way their child, who was left bruised, had been treated has been upsetting for the Nelsons, 
who were given a copy of the footage by the school on May 7.

She and her husband were shocked by the school's reaction however, and are demanding that Williams be fired.

The unpaid suspension will end just as the school breaks up for the summer vacation. 

'If I were to do that to her, I 
would go to jail,' Mr Nelson told Toledo News Now. 'I don't think she should be teaching 
anymore... There's no one that 
should ever put their hands on a child.'

Not only will Williams be back at the school after the summer vacation, she will also be teaching Ian's class.

His parents requested that their little boy - or the teacher - be moved, but the school has refused.

'He's
 scared of her, even going to the school next year, even the year after 
he'll still have to see her if she's present in the building. That’s 
probably going to scare him,' Mrs Nelson told Fox.

Investigation: Riverdale School has reported the incident to the sheriff's department

Her husband added: 'The principal told at that time that 
she's a highly recommended teacher and they are unwilling to transfer 
him to a different class.'

Eric Hoffman, the superintendent for the school, apologized to the Nelsons and said: 'We haven't dealt with this much at Riverdale ... This should not happen.'

He added that the school had filed a report with the sheriff's office, Department of Education, and Child Protective Services.
