A neighbour heard model Cheryl Maddison screaming as she was stabbed and raped in her Majorca flat but failed to call police.

Young mother Laura Pamela told a court she heard Cheryl's 'anguished' cries but was convinced it was 'just another fight' involving a British couple.

Miss Maddison, 25, was knifed repeatedly in the neck, throat and back after being attacked as she returned home from work in a bar in Magaluf.

Injuries: Cheryl Maddison, 25, was left for dead by her attacker in Magaluf. Neighbour Laura Pamela said she heard the cries but assumed they were from an arguing couple

Brave: Miss Maddison came face-to-face with her attacker Mohamed Fadel El Anssari as he admitted the crime in court in the Majorcan capital Palma

Moroccan waiter Mohamed Fadel el 
Anssari, 31, is alleged to have raped her and stabbed her with a 
seven-inch kitchen knife before leaving her for dead in May 2008.

Miss Pamela told the court that she was woken up at about 4am and could hear 'fighting and shouting in English'.

She added: 'I heard a woman screaming. It sounded like a couple having a fight. I might have heard a glass smash.

'My husband said 'It sounds as if something really bad is happening'.

Miss Pamela said that the female 
voice she could hear 'sounded anguished' but after contemplating calling
 the police she decided 'it was just another fight'.

'The flat is always rented by British holidaymakers and they always have lots of parties, get drunk and have fights,' she said.

Confessed: In stark contrast to Miss Maddison's confident arrival, Mohamed Fadel El Anssari, a 31 year-old waiter from Morocco, sat in the dock with his head buried in his hands throughout

Miss Maddison, who had moved to the island just six days earlier aged 21, pretended to be dead until her attacker fled.

She then managed to crawl out into the street before collapsing in a pool of blood.

The victim, from Houghton Le Spring, 
County Durham, sat in the public gallery to watch the second day of the 
trial with her boyfriend Kaine MacDonald, 21.

She sat just yards behind her alleged attacker, who was handcuffed in court guarded by two uniformed police officers.

Miss Maddison, who has waived her right 
to anonymity, spent two years having therapy and suffered regular panic 
attacks following the horrific ordeal.

She gave evidence for 70 minutes from behind a screen on Tuesday.

Bandaged wound: Cheryl Maddison, pictured aged 21 in 2008, said she only realised he had stabbed her in the chest when she came round and stood up to find she had been lying in a large pool of blood

Forensic doctor Julio Lopez, who examined her during her two-week stay in hospital, told the Provincial Court in Palmacourt she was lucky to survive the attack.

He said: 'Her wounds could have been fatal if she had not received urgent medical attention.'

Police found the attacker's bloodstained top dumped in a rubbish bin near Cheryl's flat.

They launched a huge manhunt but shelved the investigation the following summer after failing to make a breakthrough.

Investigations were reopened when a second British woman suffered a similar attack in Magaluf in 2010.

Fadel, a cocaine addict, was arrested in July 2011 following a lengthy undercover police operation.

DNA found on a cigarette he threw away in the street matched that found on the bedsheets at Cheryl's apartment.

It also matched traces of genetic material found on the bloodied shirt discarded near the scene of the crime, the court heard.

Tests proved beyond any doubt the DNA
 on the shirt and bedsheets belonged to Fadel, a Civil Guard detective 
told the panel of three judges.

Fadel's former boss, Jason Brown, 
told the court the Moroccan had suddenly asked for some time off to 
travel to Tenerife around the time of the attack.

Mr Brown, who employed Fadel as a 
waiter at Tom Brown's bar in Magaluf, said: 'We couldn't believe it when
 he was arrested. He was known as just a normal person, a worker.'

The court heard Fadel had been 
diagnosed as suffering from psychotic and manic episodes by a Moroccan 
doctor two months before the attack and was prescribed mood-stabilising 
drugs.

But Spanish doctors who examined him in jail after his arrest said he did not show signs of suffering from mental illness.

Dr Julio Lopez told the court: 'He did not require any treatment in prison. There were no signs of a disorder.'

Prosectors want Fadel jailed for 23 
year - 12 for attempted murder and 11 for rape. The court has heard he 
confessed to police after his arrest, telling detectives: 'I am an evil 
man'.

He refused to answer questions about the attack in court and his defence lawyer is calling for his acquittal.

The trial is expected to end on Thursday and the judges will return their verdict in a written ruling at a later date.
