In what it says would be the world's first, the U.S. Defense Department is planning to create a repository for brain tissue in an attempt to better understand traumatic brain injury amongst members of the armed services.

The goal, Defense officials say, is to understand how head trauma leads to Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes the progressive accumulation of a protein in nerve cells within certain regions of the brain.

In addition to servicemen and women, the effects of protein accumulation are often seen amongst boxers and football players, or anyone who's suffered multiple head trauma - and it often disturbs brain function.

'We have been at war for more than a decade and our men and women have 
sacrificed,' Dr. Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of defense, says in a press release. 'The military health care system is bringing all the resources it can to
 better understand how to prevent, diagnose and treat traumatic brain 
injuries and to ensure that service members have productive and long, 
quality lives.'

According to Dr. Daniel Perl, a neuropathologist and director of the brain tissue repository, soldiers 'are coming home with troubling, persistent problems and we don't know 
the nature of this, whether it's related to psychiatric responses from 
engagement in warfare or related to actual damage to the brain...'

Before the government takes any brain tissue to add to the repository, it says it will get permission from the deceased service members' families.

The repository, to be called the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine Brain Tissue Repository for Traumatic Brain Injury, was established in Bethesda, Maryland, and is being funded by a federal grant to advance the understanding and treatment of TBI in service members.

"We are learning though the process of discovery the effects of 
repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, and also how to prevent this 
issue of chronic traumatic encephalopathy," Woodson said. "The brain 
tissue repository will enable us to learn even more about how we can 
treat injuries and prevent future calamity for service members."
