Jose Mourinho has ordered Chelsea’s supporters to stop taunting Steven Gerrard with chants about the slip that wrecked Liverpool’s title run last season.

Chelsea fans still revel in the remarkable moment last April when Gerrard tumbled and allowed Mourinho’s former striker Demba Ba to blow open the title race.

Mourinho has previously gone as far as saying the fall and the 2-0 Anfield defeat directly handed the title to Manchester City — and Chelsea’s fans have been ruthless since, chanting: ‘Steve Gerrard, Gerrard, he fell on his f****** a***, he gave it to Demba Ba.’

A closer angle shows the mistake, which Jose Mourinho said gifted Manchester City the Premier League title

That is sure to be heard again at Anfield on Tuesday when Chelsea face Liverpool in the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final.

Out of their last 16 Premier League games, Chelsea play only four outside London — Aston Villa, Leicester, Hull and West Brom. Manchester City must go to Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham

But Mourinho, who this season complained Stamford Bridge was too quiet, insisted supporters need to cut USA-bound Gerrard some slack. He said: ‘He’s a historic player for Liverpool, a historic player for the Premier League. He’s an opponent I always admired and respected. There is a song that my fans have that I don’t like at all.

‘A couple of times it’s good fun but to go and go and go, especially when a player like him deserves respect, we don’t need that.’

Mourinho’s admiration for Gerrard is nothing new. Even though the Portuguese is leading what may well be the most dynamic Chelsea side in the Premier League era, he still has regrets over his failure to land the midfielder in 2005. Those resurfaced after he watched his side produce a magnificent performance of speed and imagination to demolish Swansea.

He said: ‘I was dreaming of Claude Makelele, Gerrard and Frank Lampard. We were playing in an open triangle without a No 10, we were playing with Maka in front of the defenders and me and Mr Abramovich and Peter Kenyon were dreaming that. We did everything. It was almost there. But the decision for me was proven right because he will be always a red forever. Gerrard’s people were open to it and the feeling to join a top side like Chelsea, I think the feeling was there but to me personally he never said “I will go”.’

In words that might be interpreted as a dig at Lampard, who has done so much this season to help Manchester City keep Chelsea in sight, Mourinho added: ‘I love these quotes when he (Gerrard) was saying that in this life he would never score against Liverpool. I understand why he was almost coming to Chelsea and he didn’t.’

There cannot be much Mourinho feels he is lacking at the moment even if he said a quadruple was ‘not possible’. Chelsea led within 49 seconds against Swansea and had four by the break.

Diego Costa scored his 16th and 17th goals of a wonderful season, though the blitz came from deeper positions, with Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic, Eden Hazard, Willian and two-goal Oscar surely the match of any midfield in Europe. The speed of the blitz was neatly encapsulated by Swansea’s goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, who said: ‘Compared with City, Chelsea look stronger — the midfield, their attacking force, is on a different level. They are so sharp, so quick and they try to surprise you.

‘After the last goal (scored by Andre Schurrle), I turned round to see what had happened and there were already three of their players celebrating in my six-yard box. I couldn’t believe how quickly they were there.’

The debate over where this Chelsea side ranks against earlier versions is perfectly natural, though Mourinho insists trophies are the only true gauge. Much will be learned this month with their two semi-final matches against Liverpool, as well as an FA Cup fourth-round tie with Bradford and the huge league fixture against Manchester City.
