Jessica Ennis-Hill is hoping to compete at next summer's World Championships as she builds up her conditioning to defend her Olympic title in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

The 28-year-old won gold at London 2012 but missed the Moscow World Championships the following year due to injury and sat out the entire 2014 season due to the birth of son Reggie, who arrived in July.

But she is now back in full training and is aiming to get back up to speed to compete in Beijing next summer.

Jessica Ennis-Hill is targeting the 2015 Beijing World Championships as she bids to regain full fitness 

'It's amazing being a mum,' she told Sky Sports News HQ. 'I'm loving every minute of it and it's great now I can get back on the track. It's definitely a busy time ahead, with lots to juggle.

'At the moment it's just about taking small steps but I'm hoping to compete again next summer. The World Championships in Beijing is a realistic aim and would be great.

'But the main aim is the Rio Olympics, that's where I want to be back at the top of my game.'

Kim Clijsters won the Australian Open title just 18 months after giving birth to her first child and Jo Pavey claimed European gold in the 10,000 metres this summer just 10 months after having her second.

And while Ennis-Hill admits she will have to manage her body carefully, she describes the prospect of returning to win a second gold after having a child as a 'fairytale'.

'I'm hoping to get a really good qualifying score for the Rio Games and take it from there, but I'm not pushing things too soon,' she said.

'There are lots of things to be careful about. My body has been through so much so it's all about taking small steps and listening to my physio Alison Rose.

'Even though I was training during my pregnancy it was nowhere near the level I'm training at now. It's about doing the rehab stuff and building back up as strong as I can. It's a bit like getting back on a bike again.

'But it would be incredible to be able to step away from my sport, have a baby, and then come back to win another Olympic gold medal - it would be a fairytale.' 

Following the birth of her son, Ennis-Hill missed the 2013 World Championships and entire 2014 season
