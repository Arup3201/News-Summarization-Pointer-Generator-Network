Tony Blair could be called to give evidence about so-called 'get out of jail free' letters for IRA terrorists after David Cameron set up an independent inquiry into the scandal

Tony Blair could be called to give evidence about so-called ‘get out of jail free’ letters for IRA terrorists after David Cameron set up an independent inquiry into the scandal.

The Prime Minister announced a judge-led probe into effective amnesties for Republican killers after a catastrophic blunder let the man accused of the Hyde Park bombing in 1982 walk free from court.

Mr Cameron intervened after Northern Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson threatened to quit unless there was a full inquiry into John Downey’s release, claiming was kept in the dark about the system.

The judge, who has not yet been named, will be allowed to quiz Mr Blair, former Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain and Sinn Fein figures about the letters, which have been branded ‘dirty deals’ by MPs.

Mr Blair was Prime Minister when the system was set up by Mr Hain in 2005. 187 letters have been sent to IRA men who were on the run telling them they will not face trial on the basis of the evidence against them.

But Downey, who has been blamed for the bomb blast that killed four soldiers and seven horses, escaped trial because he was mistakenly sent a letter.

The inquiry will check whether others have been incorrectly sent the letters and has the power to recommend an end to the system.

Mr Cameron yesterday made clear that if new evidence emerges against a suspect they could still be prosecuted.

‘It is important to set out the facts of what has happened,’ he said.

‘When we came to power in 2010, we inherited a process where letters were sent, setting out the factual position on whether or not some individuals were wanted for questioning by the police.

‘This process continued under this government. There was never any amnesty or guarantee of immunity for anyone, and there isn’t now.’ The Prime Minister said the judge would report back by the end of May and the report would be published.

‘The judge will have full access to government files and government officials. This needs to happen quickly. It’s right that we should take swift action. It’s such a dreadful mistake that we have to make absolutely sure that other letters were not sent in error.’

Mr Cameron said that he did not want to ‘unpick’ the decisions of his predecessors when pushing the peace process forward. ‘Very difficult decisions were taken around the time of the Good Friday Agreement and around the

time of the peace process.’

But a No 10 spokesman made clear that the judge could call for an end to the letters scheme altogether. ‘He will be able to make recommendations on this or related matters.’

A Downing Street source said ‘serving ministers and officials will have to give evidence if asked’.

While Mr Blair could not be forced to do so he is expected to cooperate if asked.

Mr Robinson welcomed the inquiry and Mr Cameron’s insistence that paramilitaries who have had letters could still be charged if further evidence against them emerges.

Withdrawing his threat of resignation, he said: ‘I think that makes it clear that they have a fairly worthless piece of paper. I think there will be a lot of on-the-runs who will sleep less easy tonight.’ Former Ulster Unionist leader Lord Trimble said he knew ‘nothing’ about the letters and said the inquiry must find out who signed off the scheme.

He said: ‘I would dearly love to know who signed off those letters. We need to find out how this process came into existence and how it operated.

He disputed claims by Jonathan Powell - Mr Blair’s former chief of staff - and Mr Hain that the scheme was effectively the result of the Good Friday Agreement.

Lord Trimble said: ‘The people who are making comments that this was all part of the peace process, it was not. The Good Friday Agreement, which had a provision for prisoner release, was quite clear there was only prisoner release, there would be no amnesties.

‘You can’t have a situation where one party - Sinn Fein - and the Government get together to undermine the Good Friday Agreement, because that is what has happened.’
