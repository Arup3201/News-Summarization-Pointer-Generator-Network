When Lakeem's friends dared him to jump in a puddle in his brand new training shoes, the worst he thought would happen was that his sparkling white and blue footwear would get a little dirty.

But he didn't bank on what seemed to be a couple of inches of surface water being quite so deep.

In an hilarious video clip on YouTube, the American teenager's attempts to entertain his friends backfire spectacularly as he ends up getting a soaking.

Leap of faith: Lakeem is egged on by his friends and promised a dollar if he jumps in the puddle in his new training shoes

Soaking: To everyone's surprise, Lakeem didn't make the light splash expected, and instead ends up completely submerged in the water

Amused: His friends, who are filming the stunt on their mobile phones, howl with laughter as their friend splashes around in the deep puddle

The youngster, dressed in short 
trousers in spite of what appears to be the remnants of snowy weather, 
is egged on by his pals as he sizes up the puddle in the car park of a 
discount store.

As his friends film on their mobile phones, Lakeem prepares to amuse his friends by jumping in to the water.

He smiles to his watching friends and is heard to laughingly say 'I'll do it for the kids' as he leaps forward.

But
 instead of making a tiny splash, the youngster disappears below the 
surface of the puddle, and is completely submerged in the deceptively 
deep puddle.

Shock: The youngster emerges from the icy water and very quickly clambers back to dry land helped by one of his friends

Laughter: The youngster collapses to the ground doubled up laughing at the unusual incident

As his pals begin 
to howl with laughter, unfortunate Lakeem resurfaces from the freezing 
water and clambers back out of the cavernous puddle back to the car park
 helped by one of his friends.

As he walks away from the puddle Lakeem and his onlooking friends fall about laughing.

The video has since gone viral on YouTube, watched by almost 250,000 people.

His friends say that they didn't realise that the puddle was so deep and had bet Lakeem a dollar to splash in it.

AkonTpain, who posted the video online, commented: 'We all thought it was a puddle SWEAR TO GOD!?'

Hilarious: The cameraman, who can be heard laughing throughout, drops to the ground unable to control his amusement at his friend's misfortune
