Resurrecting a prehistoric creature might seem like a sci-fi dream, but scientists say they have taken a step towards cloning the extinct woolly mammoth and there is a 'high chance' it will happen.

Experts expect to extract ‘high quality DNA’ from a 43,000 year old carcass found in Siberia.

The announcement follows the autopsy on the female mammoth found last year in permafrost in Russia's diamond region of the Sakha Republic, which is also known as Yakutia.

The researchers expect test results on blood (pictured) extracted from the woolly mammoth to give the genetic material needed to attempt to clone the animal

‘There was palpable excitement among the team which included scientists from Russia, the UK, the USA, Denmark, South Korea and Moldova,’ The Siberian Times reported.

The researchers expect test results on blood extracted from the woolly mammoth to provide the genetic material needed to attempt to clone the animal.

Woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern Siberia around 4,000 years ago.

Radik Khayrullin, vice president of the Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists, said: ‘The data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth.’

But he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life, urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth, not to play God for the sake of it.

Experts expect to extract 'high quality DNA' from a 43,000 year old carcass found in Siberia. They performed an autopsy on the female mammoth (pictured) focusing on its liver. The frozen beast was found last year in permafrost in Russia's diamond region of the Sakha Republic, which is also known as Yakutia

The mammoth's liver (pictured) is  very well preserved and the researchers said that it looks like there are some solid fragments inside it. They haven't got round to studying them yet, but they think they might be kidney stones

‘We must have a reason to do this, as it is one thing to clone it for scientific purpose and another to clone for the sake of curiosity,’ he said.

A cloning attempt would involve a female elephant – the closest living relative of the mammoth - acting as a surrogate mother.

Viktoria Egorova, chief of the Research and Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory of the Medical Clinic of North-Eastern Federal University, said: ‘We have dissected the soft tissues of the mammoth - and I must say that we didn't expect such results.

‘The carcass that is more than 43,000 years old has preserved better than a body of a human buried for six months.

The scientists found the liver intact on the mammoth (pictured), which The mammoth was discovered in May 2013 on Malolyakhovskiy Island in Siberia. It is thought that the animal died an unnatural death and spent many hours in agony

‘The tissue cut clearly shows blood vessels with strong walls. Inside the vessels there is haemolysed blood where for the first time we have found erythrocytes [red blood cells]. Muscle and adipose tissues [body fat] are well preserved,’ she added.

The scientists found the liver intact on the mammoth, which was discovered in May 2013 on Malolyakhovskiy Island in Siberia. Its trunk is also in excellent condition.

Mr Khayrullin said: ‘The mammoth died an unnatural death,’ explaining this was detectable from the blood.

‘It died in agony which lasted for about 16 to 18 hours,’ he said.

‘This is also confirmed by the position of the body, with its back leg stretched in an unnatural way.

'We think this was a female mammoth that fell into an ice hole from which she couldn't escape.’

Originally, after the mammoth's discovery, it was believed the creature was about 10,000 years old.  But recent analysis has put her age at 43,000 years.

The mammoth disappeared from Siberia at the end of the Pleistocene period some 10,000 years ago in circumstances that are a matter of scientific debate.

Climate change and hunting by humans may have been factors. An isolated population of the creature survived on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until around 4,000 years ago.

The scientists said they did not expect to see the soft tissues of the mammoth (pictured) in such good condition and believe there is a 'high chance' the creature could be cloned

Scientists from a number of Russian and US institutions carried out a full anatomic necropsy, which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites, on the ancient bision

An ancient bison was discovered in July 2011 in a remote part of Russia, but scientists are only now performing an autopsy in the hope that vital scientific information about the extinction of some bison species around 9,000 years ago will be revealed.

The autopsy is thought to be the first in the world on such an old bison and scientists will now look for parasites that might have plagued the animals.

The creature was found perfectly preserved in July 2011 in the Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, on the shore of a lake in the north of Ust-Yana district, where woolly mammoth remains have previously been found.

'The discovery has an enormous value for scientists since it is the best preserved bison ever found,’ said Albert Protopopov, chief of the Mammoth Fauna Research Department of the Yakutian Academy of Sciences.

Experts are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy, which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites.

U.S. scientists have long been studying bison living in North America and hope to compare them to the animal’s Yakutian relatives.

The scientists hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison's digestive organs and to publish their research next year.

Dr Protopopov said that histology samples – the samples showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - will prove the most interesting, as they will be the first chance scientists have to studying parasites attached to ancient bison.
