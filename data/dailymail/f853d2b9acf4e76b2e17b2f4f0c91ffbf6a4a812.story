Everton manager Roberto Martinez has joined the England team on the World Cup casualty list by having his tournament accreditation taken away.

FIFA took action against Martinez, who is working as a pundit for American channel ESPN, after he allowed his accreditation to be used by someone else who wanted to watch Holland train.

The FIFA pass is strictly non-transferable with the terms and conditions that the Spaniard would have signed before receiving the accreditation informing him it could be withdrawn for regulation breaches.

Enjoying himself: Roberto Martinez poses during a Holland training session in Rio at the start of the World Cup

Picking up tips: The Everton manager watched the Holland session alongside Dutch coach Ruud van Nistelrooy

The transgression took place last week and is understood to have been spotted by security at Holland’s Rio practice facility at the Flamengo Sports Club.

There would be extra sensitivity about the real Martinez being at Dutch training in any case with Holland manager Louis van Gaal becoming a Premier League rival next season as the new manager of Manchester United.

And it’s understood Martinez had received an invitation to visit the Dutch camp from fellow ESPN TV analyst Ruud van Nistelrooy, who is about to join the Holland coaching team.

Neither FIFA nor ESPN made any comment about Martinez, who can only be used as a studio analyst on their Copacabana set as he cannot gain entry to stadiums or training grounds.

England and Everton will want central defender John Stones to sort out his representation conflict as soon as possible with the youngster one of the few players to enhance his reputation this summer while training with the team in the Algarve and Miami before coming home.

The 20-year-old’s agent, Georgina Lillis, daughter of former Huddersfield midfielder Mark, has started legal proceedings against WMG for allegedly attempting to entice Stones away.

The fall-out has seen Stones delay signing a new contract with Everton until October when his contract with Lillis’s Star Management expires.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who is rarely on camera during matches to avoid being booed by the crowd, is nevertheless confident enough about his besieged position to be seen having breakfast with his nephew Philippe Blatter in Rio’s Copacabana Hotel.

There have long been allegations of nepotism against Blatter with his relative, the CEO of Infront Media, looking after FIFA’s media rights in Asia, including China and India, as well as the host broadcaster.

A group of fans who appeared to jump out of wheelchairs while watching Brazil in the opening game are being investigated by police for ticket fraud.

It transpires a renowned British tour operator has been boasting about having tickets reserved for the disabled for at least one of the matches and also claims he did a runner from a Brazil hospital to avoid paying the medical fees.

Not under suspicion, however, are BAC Sport, who have achieved the notable double of looking after the Rooneys’ travel in Brazil as well as a lot of the English media who have been focusing their attention on Wayne.

Noboby keen on Villa

Aston Villa, whose chief executive Paul Faulkner paid his own way to Brazil rather than freeload as an FA board member, have found little interest in anyone wanting to buy the club at owner Randy Lerner’s £200m asking price.

The botched bid to find a new Royal Ascot chief executive, which is more than six months behind schedule, is said to include offering the job to former LTA chief Roger Draper.

It’s understood the salary didn’t impress him after his old role paid £640,000 per year.

England's exit after two games hasn’t stopped Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, who has shown little interest in sport since joining the Cabinet, travelling to Belo Horizonte for tomorrow’s meaningless match.

A DCMS spokesman said Javid was already committed to meetings.

The dead rubber in Belo Horizonte is bad news for Elmo, a ball boy for England’s 1950 World Cup exit against the United States, who is seemingly always available for interview.
