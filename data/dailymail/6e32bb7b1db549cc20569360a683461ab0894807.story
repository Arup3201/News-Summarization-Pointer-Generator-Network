To most, a shop is just a shop.

But perhaps we are overlooking the wonder of urban temples.

Meticulously curated or a complete shambles, each store is a unique treasure trove of goods.

The newsagent: Jainul works in this underground shop in New York City for six days a week, 12 hours a day, to send money to his family in Bangladesh

Colourful: Rachid the butcher stands out among the pink and red colours in this portrait taken by Vladimir Antaki, of his shop in Paris, France

Around the world: Abou Georges stands behind a counter at his shop. He is one of 250 guardians visited by the Montreal-based photographer for the series since 2012

Squeaky clean? One of the more ordered shops is this meticulous adult book shop in London run by Yacek. Like all the photos, this is the only shot Antaki took

And for the shopkeeper, it is home.

In this incredible series of photographs, store owners - or temple guardians - across the globe give an insight into their world.

Hardware shops, thrift stores, newsagents, mechanics and adult book stores all betray their own distinctive wonder.

The project, by Montreal-based photographer Vladimir Antaki, has been ongoing since 2012.

Shrine: Pink-haired Melissa is a stoic figure in the middle of her clustered religious memorabilia, including a giant statue of Jesus under the counter in Montreal, Canada

Quriky: Richard is surrounded by hundreds of products in his thrift store in Montreal. It is the epitome of the temples Antaki describes as 'magical and overloaded'

My life: Esther says her super-organised fabric shop in Montreal, Canada, keeps her busy and gives her something to always be thinking about

Part-time: This antiques shop in London is David's day job, where he likes to relax with his dog. On the weekends, he takes part in medieval battle reenactments

Antaki spends days with each 'guardian', getting to know how they run their life and their shop.

Then, he captures the shot. 

He said: 'I'm interested in the relationship between the environment and the attitude of the Guardians, how they position themselves in space. 

'I become the director of their universe. I show them their day to day life through my eye and my camera.' 

Change of course: The Birdman in New York City worked on Wall Street until he was 35, building up a fortune. He then packed it in to open Rainbow Music

Cruising along: Abraham's mechanical store in Lebanon is doing well as the motoring industry thrives in the Middle East

Take two: Denise, pictured in her sweet shop in Paris, was forced to rebuild her intricate little world after a gas explosion in the basement downstairs

Wired up: Antaki spent a while becoming accustomed to Jose's entangled world in this basement electrical store in New York City

Under threat: Edwige is dwarfed by her vintage magazine stacks at her store in Paris, which - like many independent shops - was forced to close last year

More than just a shoe shop? Baba, in his place in Paris, is technically a shoe repairman. But you wouldn't guess it from the piles of books and globes and just one shoe

A temple for the community: Terrence uses his bookshop in Montreal, Canada, as a centre for local people to read but also to spend time off the streets

Throwback: Soon, stores will become relics in themselves - even this one run by Marie in Montreal which revels in vintage items from the last century

He added: 'These places are sometimes magical, overloaded with elements, colours and stories, guarded by these characters who are sometimes touching, funny, quirky, and at times frightening. People pay less and less attention to their environment. 

'They are always in a hurry, they don’t take the time to spend time with one another. 

'Unfortunately, these places will one day no longer be around. This is one of the reasons that compelled me to want to document these ‘guardians’. So far, I’ve visited nine cities - Montreal, New York, Las Vegas, Paris, Vienna, Berlin, London, Amsterdam, Beirut - and met nearly 250 Guardians.'
