Rampant Nigel Farage aims to destroy the Tory Party, take over a new Right-wing British political party, get Britain out of the EU - and then quit politics.

The UKIP leader’s breathtaking ambition, revealed in an interview with The Mail on Sunday, comes hours before he is set to achieve a historic victory in the European elections.

The results from Thursday’s polling, announced today, are expected to show UKIP will have gained more than 20 MEPs, more than the Conservatives, with the possibility of a total wipeout of all Lib Dem MEPs.

Triumphant: Nigel Farage at his home in Kent on the eve of the European election results. The UKIP leader hopes to have Britain out of Europe within a decade

Mr Farage rejects claims by David Cameron that UKIP’s challenge will fade away in next year’s General Election, and says today’s gains mark the beginning of the end of the Conservative Party.

He aims to repeat the destruction two decades ago of Canada’s Conservative Party, when the rebel Right-wing Reform Party, compared by many to UKIP, sparked a political earthquake.

In an interview with this newspaper earlier in the campaign, Mr Farage said a Canadian-style Tory meltdown ‘could happen’ here – and compared attacks on him to those on Reform Party leader Preston Manning and Reform’s first Canadian MP, schoolteacher Deborah Grey.

‘They called him a Right-wing extremist, a nutter, away with the fairies, he’ll never get anywhere and what happens? They won one by-election, a schoolmistress way out West, who resisted every bribe and temptation to rejoin the Conservative Party.

‘Now you have a Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, who was first elected on a Reform ticket, as were half the Cabinet.

‘Don’t think this can’t happen here. The public want something different. We are catalysing a big change in British politics on fundamental issues that have been brushed under the carpet and ignored by a completely out-of-touch career political class for too long.’ 

Ambition: Nigel Farage dismissed jibes that the rise of UKIP will hand power to pro-EU Ed Miliband at the next General Election by taking votes from the Tories

Canada’s Conservative Party was destroyed overnight in the country’s 1993 election by the populist, low-tax, Reform Party.

The century-old ruling Progressive Conservatives lost all but two of their 156 seats after sensational gains by Reform, which had been called racist, sexist and homophobic, just as David Cameron famously called UKIP ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’. The split in Canada’s Centre Right enabled the Liberals, Canada’s equivalent of our Labour Party, to take power.

But after ten years of infighting, the Reform revolution succeeded. The Canadian Alliance, a merger of Reform with the ruins of Canada’s old-style Tories, led to former Reform official Stephen Harper becoming Prime Minister in 2006. 

And it had all started with the  victory of a sole Reform MP, Ms Grey, in 1989. Mr Farage hopes a victory by UKIP’s Roger Helmer in the Newark Parliamentary by-election on June 5 will trigger a similar political shake-up at Westminster.

In his interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Farage dismissed jibes that the rise of UKIP will hand power to pro-EU Ed Miliband at the next General Election by taking votes from the Tories.

He said: ‘The arithmetic doesn’t suggest that. Firstly, the reason Conservative voters have deserted the party is that they do not believe Cameron is Conservative. It’s got nothing to do with me, but thinking there is going to be a Conservative majority is fantasy. 

‘The second reason is the Tories are dying as brand in the North of England just as they did in Scotland.The third reason Cameron can’t win a majority is he can’t get the blue-collar vote. Thatcher got it, Reagan got it, John Major got it. But these two guys (Cameron and Osborne) who allegedly don’t know the price of a pint of milk, don’t connect with the blue collar.’

Celebration: Nigel Farage aims to use UKIP's new support from Labour voters to force a weakened Ed Miliband to take a tougher stance on the EU in next year's election

While Farage says publicly an Ed Miliband victory next year would be a ‘disaster for the economy,’ some of those who know the UKIP leader well claim that in private, he says it could help him achieve a Canadian-style upheaval here. 

One UKIP aide said: ‘If Miliband wins, the Tories would be shattered and split with Eurosceptics on one side and Europhiles on the other. Nigel could team up with the Eurosceptics and possibly lead them. And, if, as Nigel believes, Miliband would be a pathetically poor PM, a Labour Government could collapse quickly with another election. Then, the Canadian scenario is on.’

Mr Farage aims to use UKIP’s new support from Labour voters to force a weakened Ed Miliband to take a tougher stance on the EU in next year’s election.

‘If I want to get this country out of the EU, I have got to change the position of the Labour Party on the referendum. If you accept it is impossible for Cameron to win a majority on his own, there could be a UKIP-Tory coalition after the election. Who knows? If it looks less and less likely that Miliband can form a majority without a referendum pledge, he’ll do it.’

Farage, 50, insists he is not interested in power for himself – and by the time he turns 60, wants to have quit politics – with Britain out of  the EU.

‘I will consider my job’s done and I would be very happy to hand over to people who might be very good at running the country. I’m in politics because I want to change things, not because I want a career. I don’t want to do this for ever, I don’t want to sit here in ten years’ time, I want to be doing something else by then, in the media, radio, writing, hopefully enjoying myself.’

He has no desire to move into  No 10, emulating ‘Canada’s Nigel Farage’ Stephen Harper. ‘I think I could do it but do I think that’s really what I would be best at in life? 

‘No. What I’m best at is spotting when something’s wrong and needs to change and agitating to wake people up to what’s gone wrong.’

Pressure on embattled Ed Miliband grew last night after a survey showed Labour would have more chance of winning the next election if they dump him.

A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday revealed that 31 per cent of Labour supporters back the party at the ballot box ‘because of’ Miliband, while 36 per cent do so ‘despite’ him.

By contrast, 48 per cent of Tories back the party because of Cameron, and 18 per cent support the party despite him.

The leadership popularity gap was 
repeated when voters were asked if they would be more likely to support a
 party if it had a new leader. Voters said ‘yes’ by a margin of 26 per 
cent in the case of Labour, compared to a margin of 13 per cent for the 
Tories.

The most common 
criticism of Miliband in the poll, which saw 1,017 adults questioned 
online on Friday, is that he lacks charisma and the ‘common touch’.

Cameron was also seen as lacking the common touch but the Prime Minister fared significantly better on charisma.

Mr Miliband will face further attacks today, with widespread forecasts of poor results in the European elections on top of similar disappointment in the town hall elections.

The Labour leader, who has been criticised for failing to stop UKIP taking votes in his party’s Northern heartlands, is due to launch a fightback on Tuesday.

He will say in a speech: ‘I am determined to show people, including those who voted for UKIP, that we can change our country for the better.’ 

But a Shadow Minister said the attempt to win back voters was like ‘bolting the stable door after the UKIP horse has bolted’. The poll also revealed that Boris Johnson is the strong favourite to succeed Mr Cameron, backed by 44 per cent of Tories. He is followed by Theresa May and George Osborne.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey has emerged as Lib Dem favourite to succeed Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with support from 32 per cent of the party’s voters, followed by Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander with Vince Cable a distant third place.

Meanwhile sharp-suited Chuka Umunna has emerged as the surprise new favourite to succeed Ed Miliband, according to the poll.

In previous surveys, Umunna has lagged behind other Labour hopefuls. But those who voted in the Survation poll did so after watching videos of Miliband’s potential successors.

The survey saw Shadow Business Secretary Umunna, 35, triumph over bookmakers’ favourite Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary.

Little-known Umunna was seen as ‘more charismatic, normal, in touch and trustworthy’ among Labour supporters than any of his rival leadership contenders.

Asked who would be most likely to make them vote Labour, Umunna won again, and he also stormed to victory in the ‘better than Miliband’ category. Dubbed the ‘British Obama’, Manchester University-trained lawyer Umunna was fast-tracked into the Shadow Cabinet.

But his ‘rising star’ status has led to him being taunted by David Cameron and privately mocked by some of his Labour colleagues.
