Sir George Castledine, 66, embarked upon a relationship with a vulnerable female patient who he was meant to be giving bereavement counselling but today he denied that his motives were either sexual or financial

A professor knighted for his role in nursing has admitted telling an 83-year-old patient that he needed to go to the gym and get fit so he could ‘make love’ to her.

Sir George Castledine, 66, made regular visits to the woman’s home 
late at night and declared his love for her in a series of phone calls 
following the death of her husband of 59 years it is claimed.

In an admission today, the married father-of-three confessed to calling the ‘vulnerable’ woman ‘darling’, ‘my little Tinkerbell’ and telling her ‘I love you’ during telephone conversations and taking her on holiday to Wales.

During one call, Sir George, one of the country’s most respected nursing experts told her that he needed to go to the gym to get fit or he ‘wouldn’t be able to make love’ to her.

Sir George also admitted lavishing the widow with gifts at Christmas and accepting presents of aftershave and flowers from her, the Nursing and Midwifery heard.

He had previously denied the allegation which relates to failing to maintain appropriate professional boundaries with the woman, known only as Patient A.

But today, Terry Munyard, representing Sir George, asked that the charge be put to him again telling the hearing: 'That claim is accepted by the registrant'

Panel chair Susan Hurds said: 'I can formally announce that this charge, in its entirety, is admitted and found proved by way of that admission.'

The allegation further states that the nurse, who was knighted for services to the healthcare profession in 2007, accompanied Patient A on a trip to Wales and continued to contact her despite knowing that she was emotionally dependent on him.

Dr Elizabeth Offen, an expert witness in clinical psychology, told a conduct and competence committee: 'The very nature of counselling is that the patient reveals very intimate details about themselves, raw primitive emotions, and that leads to increased power.

'By entering into a relationship with a patient, a counsellor would be exploiting a position of trust.'

She added that it would not be acceptable for a counsellor to accept gifts from a patient.

The NMC heard that Patient A's two daughters and son, became concerned for their mother’s well-being after the death of their father in November 2008 and took her to see a GP who referred her for bereavement counselling.

It was then that she met Sir George at Onneley House, part of the Institute of Ageing and Health, in Moseley, Birmingham.

Patient A’s daughters became alarmed 
about the relationship between their mother and Sir George when he 
started presenting her gifts and ‘popping around’ unannounced.

The concerns of the pensioner’s children grew when they began to suspect that Sir George was taking money from their mother.

Sir
George also admits having further contact with Patient A, despite being
told not to by management at South Birmingham Community Health Trust.

But he denies a series of allegations against him, including that his conduct was sexually or financially motivated.

He also denies that he gave Patient A counselling when he did not have the sufficient experience or qualifications to do so.

The panel heard that the relationship came to light after they began taping telephone conversations between them.

Sir George is also accused of accepting thousands of pounds from the pensioner, when the relationship began in early 2009.

Former Assistant Dean for the nursing faculty at Birmingham City University, and ex-nursing consultant at Dudley Group of Hospitals also Sir George worked in the Middle East and Africa for aid agencies.

He was also awarded a medal from the British Geriatric Society in 2010 for his work in relieving the suffering of people in older age.

The Oxford University graduate, who attended the central London hearing, was knighted for his services to the healthcare profession in 2007 and is a fellow of the Royal College of Nursing.

He denies all but one of the allegations against him - if found guilty of misconduct he could be struck off the nursing register.

The hearing continues.
