Hillary Clinton has condemned the disgraceful sexism directed at former prime minister Julia Gillard during her role as Australia’s leader.

Mrs Clinton, who plans to run for president in the United States, made reference to Ms Gillard in her new memoir Hard Choices, which described her experience as the US secretary of state.

'Women in public life still face an unfair double standard,' Mrs Clinton wrote in her book which was released on Tuesday.

Hillary Clinton has condemned the outrageous sexism faced by former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard in her memoir which was released on Tuesday

'Even leaders like former prime minister Julia Gillard of Australia have faced outrageous sexism which shouldn't be tolerated in any country.'

Both women have faced their fair share of sexism throughout their political careers with Ms Gillard's famous sexism speech in 2012, directed at the current prime minister Tony Abbott, still ringing in the ears of women across the world.

Mrs Clinton and Ms Gillard first met in the same year of the speech, at a meeting in Perth.

In an interview with Anne Summers, Ms Gillard recalled her meeting with the US senator who had offered her some useful advice.

'We did have a discussion about where our media cycle was stuck then, which was this relentless opposition questioning about events the best part of 20 years ago,' Ms Gillard said to Summers, in reference to the scandal that arose about her time as a lawyer at Slater and Gordon.

The advice she gave the then prime minister was: 'You've got to stand up to it and be clear about it and name it for what it is because the temptation is to say, "Look this is so absurd, it'll die a death", whereas these things unfortunately don't die a death,' Ms Gilard recalled.

Clinton’s memoir was released with great gusto across the US with book events and vast media coverage.

The interview connected to the book's release highlighted some of the hurdles she could face if she seeks the White House again: her record as President Barack Obama's top diplomat, the turbulence of her husband's presidency and charges by Republicans that she has been insulated from the everyday problems of Americans after more than two decades in public life.
