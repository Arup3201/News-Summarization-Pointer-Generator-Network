Armed police and a helicopter were called to a branch of Waitrose after a row broke out between two shoppers and one threatened to return with his two shotguns.

Supermarket workers called police after an irate customer announced he would ‘come back with some guns’ during a heated argument with a fellow shopper.

A police helicopter and armed response unit tracked the customer as he stormed out of the supermarket in Southend-on-Sea, Essex.

The 65-year-old, from Rayleigh, Essex, was later arrested at a nearby branch of Sainsbury's.

It is still unclear what triggered the row at around 12.45pm last Tuesday.

'There was a dispute and the customer made threats, saying he would come back with some guns,' said Chief Inspector, Simon Anslow, district commander for Southend.

'There are serious consequences for making threats, whether you intend to carry out the full action or not.

'If you mention firearms, Essex Police will take that seriously.

'We had the helicopter out, numerous firearms officers and road closures are often involved.

'While that is taking place, officers are being taken away from dealing with other incidents.'

Police later discovered the disgruntled shopper owned two shotguns, which have since been seized.

The man was taken to Southend police station and given a caution after admitting disorderly conduct.

A Waitrose spokesman said: 'There was an exchange of words between two customers which was brought to our attention and we felt it necessary to inform the police.

'We are grateful to the police for their support.'
