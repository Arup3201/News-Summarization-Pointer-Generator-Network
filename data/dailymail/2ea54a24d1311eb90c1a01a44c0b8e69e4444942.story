The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved a far-reaching immigration bill - after its chairman withdrew an amendment allowing gay couples to obtain green cards for spouses born outside the U.S.

The 13-5 vote clears the bill for a Senate debate expected to begin early next month.

Committee approval came after the panel's chairman, Sen Patrick Leahy sidestepped a showdown on the rights of gay spouses, caving to pressure from the White House and others who feared such a vote could lead to the bill's failure in the Senate.

Heated: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen Patrick Leahy confers with the committee's ranking Republican, Sen Chuck Grassley during immigration bill talks

The much-awaited announcement on Tuesday by the Vermont Democrat clears 
the way for passage by his committee of the legislation 
offering the possibility of citizenship to millions in this country 
illegally.

Leahy had been under pressure from gay rights groups to offer the 
amendment, which would have allowed gays to petition to bring their 
spouses to the United States like straight Americans can.

But the White House and other Democrats privately urged Leahy to hold
 off as Republican supporters of the immigration bill threatened to 
withdraw their support over the issue.

In a statement released on Tuesday evening, President Obama said: 'I congratulate the Senate Judiciary Committee on completing its work on S. 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.  

'Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Leahy and a bipartisan group of eight Senators, the legislation that passed the Judiciary Committee with a strong bipartisan vote is largely consistent with the principles of commonsense reform I have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system.'

The controversy over the rights of gay spouses, with the ability to 
fracture a bipartisan coalition behind the legislation, has hovered in 
the background of the debate from the beginning.

Solution? An additional surge in immigrant traffic to the U.S. has begun since 
immigration reform negotiations began

As drafted by the Gang of Eight, four Republicans and four Democrats 
who negotiated the basic provisions of the legislation, gay spouses do 
not have the same right to a green card as heterosexual spouses.

Sen John McCain, a Gang of Eight member who does not have a seat on the judiciary committee, said: 'It would kill the bill. You'd lose the evangelicals, you'd lose the Catholic 
Church, and the issue is wending its way through the courts.

'And so 
for the amendment to be included is destructive to this carefully 
crafted compromise."

Two people familiar with the deliberations said the White House had 
suggested to Leahy that it would be best to put the controversy aside 
until the bill goes before the full Senate, and congressional officials 
said similar pleas had come from Democratic senators.

All said they were
 not authorized to discuss the matter on the record and insisted on 
anonymity.

Leahy's comment to reporters was unlikely his final word on the 
issue, and hardly the first time he has demonstrated his independence on
 this and other bills. Most recently, he was the sole opponent of an 
amendment that passed 17-1 on Monday to make a third drunk driving 
conviction a deportable offense for immigrants in some instances.

An April 10 rally in front of the U.S. Capitol 
brought tens of thousands of immigration advocates, and generated more 
subway traffic in Washington, D.C. than on the day of President Obama's second inauguration

Still, a vote on the proposal could create political difficulty for 
Democrats on the committee who support gay rights and are also members 
of the Gang of Eight, including Schumer and Sen. Dick Durbin of 
Illinois. Durbin has told outside groups he will back the change if it 
is offered. Schumer hasn't said which way he would vote.

All eight authors of the bill have pledged to maintain the essential 
outlines of the legislation. A vote to add the gay rights provision 
could lead to approval on a party-line vote in committee.

On a final day of drafting, the panel also agreed to a last-minute compromise covering an increase in the visa program for high-tech workers.

The landmark legislation creates new provisions to bring workers here legally and enforce against illegal immigration, as well as creating a path to citizenship for 11 million here illegally.

California is the home of up a large number of 
illegal immigrants, including some who protested in front of the office 
of California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein on April 10, in an 
attempt to persuade her to support immigration reform legislation

The measure also creates a new program for low-skilled foreign labor 
and would permit highly skilled workers into the country at far higher 
levels than is currently the case.

At the same time, it requires the 
government take new steps to guard against future illegal immigration.

As the day wore on, opponents of the bill made a final bid to strip 
the measure of its signature feature - a path to citizenship that could 
take 13 years and payment of fines totaling $2,000 to travel. Sen Ted 
Cruz' proposal failed on a vote of 13-5.

The rejection was one of numerous ways in which the bipartisan 
coalition behind the White House-backed measure demonstrated its command
 of the proceedings.

Without so much as a roll call vote, the panel adopted a compromise 
setting the terms of the expansion of H-1B high tech visas, a deal that 
brought Sen Orrin Hatch, R-Utah over to the ranks of supporters.

Under the deal, the number of highly skilled workers admitted to the 
country would rise from 65,000 annually to 110,000, with the possibility
 of a further rise to 180,000 depending in part on unemployment levels.
