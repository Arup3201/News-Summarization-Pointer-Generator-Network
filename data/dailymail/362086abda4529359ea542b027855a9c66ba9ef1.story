How many times did Barry Ferguson witness this scene when he and Kris Boyd were Rangers team-mates?

The ball lands at the Boyd’s feet and, without breaking stride, he coolly sends it beyond the opposition goalkeeper.

Such an image was once a source of joy for Ferguson. The feeling it created on Monday night was distinctly different.

Any hope the former captain had of a shock triumph on his return to Ibrox was shredded from the moment Boyd netted the first goal of his second spell in light blue.

The peerless poacher duly completed a hat-trick amid a relentless rout that saw Ferguson’s collection of part-time players five down by the break.

It just so happened that Monday was Boyd’s 31st birthday. You get the feeling he wouldn’t have wanted to celebrate in any other way.

After an incredible 127 goals in his first Rangers stint between 2006 and 2010, he was now back in the old routine to aid a cruise into the quarter-finals of the Petrofac Training Cup. Ally McCoist will be hoping it also sparks Boyd to provide the potency required to buoy their Championship challenge.

With doubles from Lee McCulloch and Lewis Macleod, and a further strike from Fraser Aird, this became a gruelling evening for Ferguson and his charges. Numerous members of the League Two side had turned in a shift in their respective trades before heading to Ibrox and tugging on their boots. Come full-time, they could at least take the slimmest sliver of consolation from Kevin Watt’s last-gasp reply.

Yet the resounding scoreline was not the only notable statistic to emerge last night. The attendance of 11,190 was the lowest at Ibrox since the Graeme Souness revolution of 1986. It made for an atmosphere far removed from some of the high-octane occasions Ferguson once savoured. 

Tough to take: Clyde player-manager, and former Rangers midfielder, Ferguson looks on during the 8-1 defeat

His last appearance as a player at the Govan ground had come against Aberdeen in May 2009. By that point, of course, his number was up after upsetting manager Walter Smith with his role in the Boozegate fiasco while on Scotland duty a couple of months earlier.

That foolish incident – when Ferguson and Allan McGregor had a booze binge at the national team hotel before compounding their felony with childish v-signs at photographers – cast a shadow over his second spell at the club.

Yet his achievements remain remarkable. Before exiting to Birmingham City, Ferguson signed off by lifting the Scottish Cup for a fifth time with victory over Falkirk at Hampden. Added to five league titles and five League Cups, not to mention reaching the 2008 UEFA Cup final, he stands as one of the most successful Rangers players in the modern era. A total of 431 appearances produced 61 goals.

Ferguson had insisted pre-match that he would attempt to take the game to McCoist’s men and duly set out his side in a bold 4-3-3 formation. Their optimism didn’t last long.

By half-time, he was doubtless wishing he had taken a far more cautious approach with a group of players whose Rangers links extended well beyond the dug-out.

Scott McManus, a nephew of Walter Smith, spearheaded their attack. Gordon Durie’ s son Scott filled the right-back role. On the left wing was Scott Ferguson, an old friend of Macleod’s from the Murray Park youth system.

They were soon completely swamped by the superior quality of their hosts. Jamie Barclay had already turned away a powerful drive from Aird before being beaten with 15 minutes on the clock.

Frustratingly for the Ferguson, it was a concession with its roots in a Clyde attack. His namesake Scott fired a shot across the Rangers goal before the threat floundered.

Nicky Clark collected the ball deep inside his own half and drove fully 50 yards before dabbing a pass through for Boyd. His first-time finish was perfectly placed into the far corner of the net.

The lead was doubled eight minutes later. A well-weighted pass from Macleod released Lee Wallace on the left. His low cross was dummied by Boyd and Aird stepped in with a low drive that Barclay couldn’t keep out.

Boyd then claimed his second after 32 minutes following a lovely little interchange. Macleod rolled the ball across the area after being gifted possession by Durie. Boyd ran over it and spun into space, collecting the return from Clark and stroking another first-time shot inside the post.

McCulloch lashed home eight minutes before the break, but the skipper was outdone in the long-range stakes on the stroke of half-time.

He help steer Aird’s pass into the path of Macleod and watched in admiration as the 20-year-old curled a terrific 25-yard effort beyond the despairing Barclay.

Steve Simonsen was in for Cammy Bell at the opposite end and was enjoying a far easier outing than his last cup tie, when he endured a nightmare in Dundee United’s Scottish Cup success here in April.

Ferguson hoped to finally bring Simonsen into action with a triple substitution at the break, but the flow of the game was soon flooding back towards Barclay.

Rangers replacement Dean Shiels, on for Clark, set up Macleod for another lovely strike on 65 minutes – this time angled low across the Clyde goalkeeper.

McCulloch then sent an unstoppable blast from 20 yards into the top corner of the net after 77 minutes before Boyd rounded off his treble two minutes later. Yet again, it was the calmest of conversions.

When Watt burst through in the final moments to zip a shot high past Simonsen, the veteran Englishman looked furious at being left exposed. Yet the remaining Rangers fans simply broke into a charitable round of applause for opponents stuck through the wringer by Boyd and his cohorts.
