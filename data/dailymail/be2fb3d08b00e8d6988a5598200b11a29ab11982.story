As legalized marijuana sales take off in Colorado, more businesses are realizing the value of pot in their business model.

Twenty states and the District of Columbia allow medical marijuana but voters in Colorado and Washington state went a step further in 2012, becoming the first in the nation to legalize small plant amounts for adult recreational use and to regulate it like alcohol.

Although there are strict state guidelines, governing what can and cannot be said with regards to cannabis use, wise businesses are looking towards ambitious cannabis business strategies with the potential for big sales and profits.

Spirit Airlines: The air carrier is veering into a product-pitching space long dominated by late-night, fast-foodies, hinting at legalized marijuana while beckoning flyers to 'get mile high'

Spirit Airlines is hinting at legalized marijuana beckoning their fliers to ‘get mile high.’

The airline, playing  off the approved use and sale of cannabis in the Rocky Mountain State, and offering discounted fares to Colorado where, its ad informs, ‘the no smoking sign is off,’ with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge attitude using a sales niche called marijuana marketing.

The tactic is now also being used by other well known brands Taco Bell, Jack in the Box, Denny's and Carl's Jr, running ads suggesting weed use, with code words like ‘munchies’ or ‘bake’.

‘Spirit operates in a cutthroat business. They get outshouted by the bigger brands so they have to make their marketing dollars work harder and go further. And the message needs to be disruptive,’ said Simon Williams, to CNBC, Williams is the founder and CEO of Sterling Brands, a brand consultancy with clients that include Google, Disney and Visa.

Target audience: The new marijuana economics means bigger business for some companies - but they have to be carefully worded

‘One of the most effective ways of doing that is courting controversy. Another way is being irreverent. They appear to be doing both and adding some humor in the process,’ Williams added. ‘As long as Spirit is not alienating its core target, I think that the current messaging is fine.’

While customers may be lining up outside the pot shops in Colorado, many other companies are using the legalization of marijuana to spur conversation about their product as well.

With two states (Colorado and Washington) having legalized adult cannabis use and 21 states having sanctioned some form of medical marijuana, the number of mainstream companies that sprinkle a bit of pot into their TV pitches will only grow.

 Timothy Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management believes that this kind of marketing works for Spirit, but wouldn’t work for legacy characters such as United.

Got the munchies? Companies are being careful not to make the direct link between cannabis and the 'munchies' even though everyone knows that's what they're doing

Carefully worded: The tactic has been delicately plied by other brands, including Taco Bell, Jack in the Box, Denny¿s and Carl¿s Jr.

‘Many brands in this country aren't going anywhere near the legalization issue. For most brands, that's very smart,’ Calkins said. ‘Some brands, though, can push this. We're going to see more brands take advantage of this and use this as a way to define themselves.’

Referring to Spirit Airlines pot-inspired poster, said Kevin Sabet, a co-founder of Project SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana) doesn’t think it’s a good idea.  ‘It's just part of trying to climb on the bandwagon of being edgy and trying to be cool to get a certain demographic. But most people will put two and two together and realize they don't want a company they rely on for safety, glamorizing and normalizing something that directly would result in an accident. I'm not sure it's best practice for an airline. And if you really think about it, it's unbelievable.’

Some food-focused entrepreneurs are betting adult recreational marijuana becomes an alternative to wine consumption.

Although no mainstream companies that are experimenting with marijuana marketing use the word ‘marijuana’ in their ads, the companies are also unwilling to explain the thinking behind their productions – and leaving it for the public, or perhaps just pot heads to work out.
