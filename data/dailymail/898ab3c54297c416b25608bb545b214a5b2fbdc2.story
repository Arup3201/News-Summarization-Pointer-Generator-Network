Chancellor George Osborne today came under fresh pressure to slash duty on petrol and diesel by 3p a litre after damning new figures reveal UK drivers are suffering from the biggest fuel tax burden in Europe.

Motorists in the UK pay the highest proportion of tax in the EU - despite a Government  freeze on fuel duty since March 2011, damning new  figures from the respected  RAC Foundation reveal.

Britons face ‘the greatest fuel tax burden in Europe’, it says.

Some 60 per cent of the cost of petrol is made up of tax imposed by the Treasury

Some 61p in every pound spent at the pumps on a litre of unleaded petrol - and 59p in every pound spent  on a litre of diesel – goes directly to  the Chancellor in fuel duty and VAT, says the RAC.

It means that of the 28 countries in the EU, UK drivers pay the highest proportion of tax for diesel and the second highest for petrol after Sweden.

Duty on fuel is currently a flat-rate 57.95p per litre. But the full tax of the fuel, including duty,  is then also subject to an additional tax burden of VAT levied at 20 per cent in total – making it a ‘tax on a tax’.

Ironically, UK drivers pay some of the cheapest pre-tax fuel in Europe – but only before the full tax is levied, says the RAC.

The figures were seized on by FairFuel campaigners demanding that the Chancellor cut duty by 3p a litre in the Spring Budget later this month. By the time VAT at 20 per cent is added, that would amount to a tax reduction of around 4p.

Chancellor George Osborne has already acted to freeze fuel duty since taking power, but campaigners want him to go further

And the RAC Foundation itself said the Chancellor should go ‘ beyond his promise to continue the fuel duty freeze and actually cut the rate further.’

The RAC figures show that UK drivers who pay £1.37 at the pumps for a litre of diesel  see 59.09per cent of that going  directly to the Government as tax. 

That is the highest proportion of tax in Europe ahead of second place Sweden where diesel costs £1.24,  of which 56.04 per cent is tax. Drivers in third place Italy pays 54.72 per cent tax followed by Ireland (52.51 per cent), Slovenia (51.57 per cent), and Finland (50.15 per cent).

Motorists in seventh place France are charged just £1.09 for litre of diesel, of which 49.90 per cent is tax, ahead of Holland (49.65per cent) and Germany (48.88 per cent) from a litre of diesel costing just £1.17.

A 3p a litre duty cut – plus the near 1p reduction in VAT - would see the UK price drop to £1.33p and the proportion of tax to 49.58 per cent, just ahead of Germany.

Lowest proportion of tax on diesel is in Luxembourg where  the fuel costs just 98p a litre of which 41.08per cent is tax.

For petrol,  UK drivers pay the second highest proportion of tax  after Sweden.

Petrol here is £1.30 a litre of which 61.42 per cent is tax, compared to 61.86per cent  in Sweden where the cost of fuel is actually cheaper at £1.24 per litre.

Third place is the Netherlands (60.65per cent), followed by  Greece (59.86 per cent), Italy 959.02 per cent)and Ireland (58.71per cent).

France is in eighth place at 57.64 per cent just ahead of Germany at 57.05per cent.

If the Chancellor cut UK duty by 3p with a 1p fall in VAT the UK would drop to 18th place with unleaded costing £1.26 of which just over half (52.33per cent wold be VAT.

Lowest tax for unleaded is  in Bulgaria  where drivers pay £1.05 a litre at the pumps of which 44.95per cent is tax, just ahead of Romania (£1.09 per litre of  which 47.70per cent is tax).

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘On 19th March the Chancellor will deliver his budget. He has made much of the fact that fuel duty has not risen for three years. However this has made little impact on the huge proportion of tax the UK’s 36 million drivers pay on their fuel.’

He noted: ’The irony is that if you take tax out of the equation we actually have the fifth cheapest diesel in the EU and the second cheapest petrol. The oil companies and retailers are often blamed for soaring pump prices but these figures reveal that’s not the whole picture.’

Fuel duty accounts for 61 per cent of the petrol price in the UK, the second highest proportion in Europe

Professor Glaister said:’With the poorest car owners now spending as much as a third of their income on buying and running a vehicle, and with a record number of people now commuting to work by car, there are plenty of reasons why the Chancellor should consider going beyond his promise to continue the fuel duty freeze and actually cut the rate further.’

RAC Foundation research shows that some 800,000 of the poorest car-owning households in the UK spend about a third of their disposable income on buying and running a vehicle.

Its analysis also shows that a record 16.7million people in England and Wales are reliant on a car to get to work: 15.3 million as drivers and 1.4 million as passengers.

Campaign group FairFuel UK seized on the figures to demand a 3p cut in duty, amounting to a near 4p (3.6p) cut after VAT.

Quentin Willson, lead campaigner for FairFuelUK said: ‘Having the highest duty for diesel and second highest for petrol in the EU is a cruel and needless burden on the millions who have no option but to commute to work and shop for essentials by car.

'This is why so many complain they’re spending so much of their incomes on mobility. A fuel duty cut of 3 pence in the March Budget would hugely benefit everybody in the UK, but especially the poorest.’

Howard Cox, co-founder of FairFuelUK said: ‘This punitive tax on UK road users has to be slashed. The Chancellor currently takes considerably more at the pumps for diesel in tax than any other EU Finance Minister.

'Our call for a 3p duty cut would mean that the UK would drop to 18th in the EU 'tax take' for petrol and 9th for diesel.  Such a fuel duty cut would be self-financing and a vote winner.’

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Freezing fuel duty has been a major priority of the Government. As a result, petrol will be 20p a litre cheaper than it otherwise would have been. This represents an average saving for motorists of £680 over the course of the Parliament.

‘To help families with the cost of living, we have also increased the tax free personal allowance, taking 2.7 million people out of tax altogether.’
