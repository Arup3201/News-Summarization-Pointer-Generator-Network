Andrew Stone as he arrived at Hammersmith Magistrates Court today. He is accused of assaulting his 25-year-old girlfriend as she wouldn't listen to music with him

A reality TV star who worked with Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue punched and strangled his girlfriend in a vodka-fuelled rage.

Dancer Andrew Stone, who has appeared on Celebrity Big Brother and Pineapple Dance Studios, kicked his girlfriend out of his bed, grabbed her by the throat and tried to choke her after she refused to stay up late and listen to music.

Stone, 40, had drunk five double vodkas and coke at his flat in Marylebone, central London, when he attacked girlfriend Claudia Cersosimo in the early hours of January 30 this year.

Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard how Miss Cersosimo, 25, was left so scared by the attack that the mere mention of Stone’s name causes an anxiety attack.

Miss Cersosimo was ill with a viral infection and trying to sleep but Stone was playing loud music and kept badgering her to answer questions about the tracks he was playing.

When the 25 year-old told him she just wanted to get to sleep Stone attacked her.

Giving evidence from behind a screen, she told the court: 'He said if I didn’t answer him he would kick me out of the bed. Then he chucked me out of the bed and I span out.

'I don’t know how it happened because it was all so fast but he was somehow at my side wrestling me out of the bed. He used his leg, I think it must have taken two goes and then I landed on the floor.

'He wrestled me onto the bed and then he pinned me down and with his hand started strangling me so I couldn’t breathe.

'He was putting quite a lot of weight
down on me at the same time he pinned my arms down because I was trying
to push him off me.

'I was really scared at that point, I think I was just shouting "Get off me, Get off me".'

Passing verdict at West London Magistrate's Court, Deputy District Judge Karim Ezzat said yesterday he found Miss Cersosimo a 'credible witness' and believed her version of events.

He said: 'Having considered all of the evidence that I've heard and having regard to the photographic evidence I've seen I am satisfied that the injuries caused to Miss Cersosimo were caused in the manner she describes and I therefore find you guilty.'

Looking downcast and surprised, Stone, 40, glanced back to his manager in the public gallery as the verdict was read out.

Wearing a dark grey sparkly blazer, 
black suit trousers and patent black leather shoes, Stone shook his head
as he listened to the evidence against him during the short trial.

He claimed that Miss Cerosimo's injuries were self inflicted.

Miss Cersosimo added that she screamed at Stone to get off her, but he lunged for her again and punched her.

She said: 'As he came up he punched me in my right eye, I remember starting to scream and holding my right eye.

Andrew Stone, who was on Celebrity Big Brother, denied attacking her, claiming that the injuries were self-inflicted

'I remember getting down on the floor and crawling away from the bed. He came at me again and he was holding me by the collar of the T-shirt I was wearing. He was yanking my collar it left red marks round my neck.'

Miss Cersosimo managed to kick Stone off her, and fled to the bathroom where she called the police on her mobile phone.

But she didn’t lock the door and Stone followed her to the bathroom, kicked the door open and stood in the doorway blocking her way out.

'He was more calm, but he hadn’t acknowledged what he had just done, he just said ‘get off the phone’ he was really rude and abrupt. He was still aggressive in his tone,' she said.She managed to get to the front door where she tried to buzz the police in through the intercom but Stone twice hit the intercom phone out of her hand.

She told the court: 'Then he got my clothes and bag and stuff and threw it by the door and that is when the police entered the property.'

Following his arrest, he told police the couple had argued, and that she locked herself in the bathroom and inflicted the injuries on herself.

‘She always does that - making a big deal out of something small,’ he said.

The 25-year-old met the reality TV star in a nightclub in Covent Garden, central London, a year earlier and had been dating for a few months.

But the pair had a tempestuous relationship and Miss Cersosimo said she believed Stone was cheating on her.

Defence counsel Tyrone Smith asked Miss Cersosimo: 'You believed he was having sex with other people.'

She replied: 'Yes'.

The dancer told police that he had drank four or five double vodkas that evening

Referring to a text message Miss Cersosimo has sent to Stone Mr Smith said: 'You name a girl and you believe she was smirking at you and you believe the defendant was texting her for sex.'

Miss Cersosimo said: 'Yes, because I had seen the text messages. He kept telling me how he didn’t want to be sleeping with other girls anymore and telling me that he loved me, but the day (that text) was sent he was with her.'

She told the court: 'I knew what he was like, that was effectively cheating on me.'

Miss Cerosimo has struggled with a history of depression and self-harm and once fled to Stone’s bathroom with a kitchen knife.

The case's prosecutor said that since the alleged attack she has been suffering from severe anxiety attacks.

Jumoke Hughes said: 'Since this she has been having severe anxiety attacks. The mere mention of the defendant’s name or seeing the defendant causes her to have serious attacks.'

He said Miss Cersosimo 'would like a restraining order' but the judge said this would be dealt with at sentencing and warned Stone that he faces a community service order as well.

Stone declined to comment as he left court as he was released on bail and will be sentenced at West London Magistrate's Court on the morning of May 23.

His agent said: 'We are disappointed with the outcome and we will be taking it further.'

Stone denied common assault. Originally from Kettering in Northamptonshire, Stone boasts a CV featuring 30 years’ dance experience.

He trained at the Central School of Ballet and has toured with stars including Kylie, Britney Spears, Tina Turner, and Ricky Martin.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Mr Terry Mills of Big Talent Group was Mr Andrew Stone’s agent. We are happy to make clear that this is not the case, nor did he make any comment in relation to this case.
