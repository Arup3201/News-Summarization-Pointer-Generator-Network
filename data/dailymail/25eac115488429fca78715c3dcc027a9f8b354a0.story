Ebola-stricken Dr Craig Spencer has been whiling away the hours in quarantine strumming on his banjo and exercising, it was revealed Wednesday.

Spencer, 33, has been in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan for the past two weeks, slowly recovering from the deadly virus he had contracted while working in Guinea as part of Doctors Without Borders.

He was diagnosed with Ebola October 23 , a week after returning home from Africa.

On the mend: Dr Craig Spencer has been whiling away the hours in quarantine strumming on his banjo and exercising

New-age recreation: Spencer has been doing yoga and playing David Bowie and Interpol songs all day long, which has earned him the reputation as a 'total hipster'

Last week, the doctor requested that someone bring him his banjo from his apartment so he could pass the time in quarantine playing music.

Spencer also reportedly has been keeping in shape by riding a stationary bicycle in his hospital room.

‘HHC has done everything possible to keep our patient comfortable. At his request, we gave him a banjo and put an exercise bike in his room. He has been using both,’ Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for the New York City Health and Hospital Corp, confirmed to the New York Daily News.

Another source told the New York Post that Spencer also has been doing yoga and playing David Bowie and Interpol songs all day long, which has earned him the reputation as a 'total hipster' among hospital staff, some of whom were not impressed by his taste in music.

These latest developments suggest that Mr Spencer is well on his way to a full recovery.

Last weekend, his condition was upgraded from 'serious' to 'stable,' and a source told the paper that he is expected to be discharged within the next few weeks.

‘He is an avid little banjo player and he’s self-taught,’ Chriselle Gardner, the mother of Spencer’s fiancee Morgan Dixon, told the Post. ‘I can tell you, he’s keeping his doctors amused.’

Dixon has been in quarantine at their apartment since October 25. She will be able to leave their home for the first time since Craig’s diagnosis on November 14.

New York City health officials also announced Wednesday that a person who had been in contact with Dr Spencer is being released from mandatory quarantine, but will be subject to daily evaluations by a doctor, reported CBS New York. 

More good news: Spencer's fiancee, Morgan Dixon, will be allowed to leave their apartment November 14 after 21 days in isolation

The HHC emphasized that the person in question does not show any Ebola symptoms and does not pose any health risk to the general public.

City officials revealed Wednesday that a total of 357 people were being actively monitored for signs of Ebola as a precaution, among them travelers from West Africa and Bellevue staff caring for Dr Spencer
