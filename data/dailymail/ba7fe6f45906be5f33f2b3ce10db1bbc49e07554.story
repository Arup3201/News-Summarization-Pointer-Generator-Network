A Mexican military helicopter involved in an anti-drug smuggling operation flew into America before shooting at two US Border Patrol agents yesterday.

KVOA-TV reported the chopper fired over Tohono O’odham Indian Nation in the Arizona desert, before flying back to Mexico early Thursday morning. The agents were not injured.

Border Patrol Tucson Sector union president Art del Cueto said Mexican officials 'contacted US authorities and apologized for the incident' which occurred between midnight and 6am.

Location: Authorities said the Mexican military helicopter fired two shots over Tohono O'odham Indian Nation in the Arizona desert near the border, before flying back to Mexico early Thursday morning

US Border Patrol spokesman Andy Adame confirmed the report, saying the 'Mexican law enforcement helicopter' fired two shots 'while on a drug interdiction operation near the border'.

He said the incident was under investigation.

Sebastián Galván, a spokesman for the Mexican Consulate in Tucson, told AP the office was gathering information but did not have any details yet.

This was not the first time the Mexican military has veered across the international boundary.

In January, US border agents confronted two heavily armed Mexican soldiers who crossed 50 yards inside Arizona, the Los Angeles Times reported. A standoff ensued, but nobody was hurt.

In 2011, more than 30 uniformed Mexican soldiers in military vehicles crossed the Rio Grande without authorization in an incident that was believed to be inadvertent.

According to a recent Washington Times story, the US Department of Homeland Security says that Mexican police or troops have crossed over the border around 300 times during the last decade, and were armed in around half of those incidents.
