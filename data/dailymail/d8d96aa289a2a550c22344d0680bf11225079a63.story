Tim Howard has claimed that fellow American Brad Friedel 'actively tried to block' his move to Manchester United in 2003 - a charge the Tottenham veteran has called 'ludicrous'. 

Howard was signed by Sir Alex Ferguson from Major Soccer League side Metrostars (now the New York Red Bulls) to replace Fabien Barthez before eventually joining Everton permanently in 2007.

However, in his new autobiography The Keeper, Howard claims he was told that Friedel refused to submit a statement on his behalf ahead of the transfer.

Friedel strongly refutes the suggestion, telling ESPN: 'It's complete garbage. To be honest with you, all we're looking for is an apology. We can't get the book reprinted. I'm not looking for monetary gain. I just want an apology.' 

In extracts of his book revealed exclusively by ESPN, Howard says: 'Man U told us that Friedel had refused to submit a statement on my behalf,'

Howard writes: '"You're kidding me", I said. Friedel was among what was then a handful of American players in the Premier League; his influence was huge. 

'Having himself been denied several times, he understood better than anyone exactly what was at stake. Why wouldn't he vouch for me?

'I mean, who would sabotage his own countryman like that?' 

Howard arrived at Old Trafford from MLS side Metrostars in 2003 and spent three seasons with United

Howard says he later learned from United's legal team that Friedel, then playing in the Premier League for Blackburn Rovers, 'hadn't merely refused to sign a statement on my behalf, he had actively tried to block my transfer.

'He'd written to the appeals committee suggesting that I shouldn't be given a work permit at all.'

Friedel initially responded to the claims by saying: 'There is no letter.

'I never sabotaged, and I never stood in the way of Tim Howard getting a work permit. This is ludicrous.'
