Former England forward Gareth Hock could face his old Salford team-mates after his new club Leigh were paired with the Red Devils in the draw for the fifth round of the 2015 Ladbrokes Challenge Cup.

Hock joined the Centurions last month after being released by Salford but is still waiting to make his debut after being handed a seven-match ban for illegal use of his knees.

The ex-Wigan second rower's suspension is set to expire on Easter Monday, well before the cup-tie with Salford, which will be played at Leigh Sports Village on the weekend of April 17-19.

Despite being a division below the unbeaten Centurions will pose a tough task for the Red Devils, who are eighth after six games.

Salford were one of four Super League clubs to enter the famous knockout competition on Tuesday after finishing outside the top eight last season. 

All of the clubs from the top flight managed to avoid each other in the draw, which was made by the banks of the River Hull.

Bradford, whose last Cup final was in 2002, will be at home to Hull KR in arguably the tie of the round. 

The 2005 winners Hull FC were paired with Sheffield Eagles and Wakefield face a trip to Halifax.

Leigh Miners Rangers, the only amateur team left in the competition, landed a home tie against League One club York. 

The final match-up is an all-Championship clash between Hunslet and Dewsbury at the South Leeds Stadium.

The remaining eight Super League clubs will enter the competition at the sixth round stage in May.
