Killer: Dano Sonnex was found guilty of murdering two French students while at large despite having been recalled to jail

More than 400 wanted criminals, including murderers, paedophiles and rapists, have been at large in Britain for more than five years.

The dangerous offenders should have been returned to prison after committing fresh crimes or breaking the rules of their early release.

But they have evaded the police and are instead walking the streets. Critics said the criminals posed a ‘tremendous risk’ to the public.

A Freedom of Information Act request revealed that 413 offenders ‘unlawfully at large’ at the end of last year had been wanted for more than five years.

They included 48 violent offenders, comprising 13 convicted murderers, one other killer, three who attempted to kill, 17 guilty of wounding or other serious assaults and 14 of lower level violent crimes.

Nine were guilty of rape, three of gross indecency with children and 11 of other sexual offences.

The total also included 37 robbers, 44 convicted burglars and 97 drugs offenders.

Thirty-seven were thieves or were caught handling stolen goods and there were 66 fraudsters. The remainder committed motoring or unclassified crimes. The criminals came from across England and Wales, with more than 200 on the Metropolitan Police’s list and 41 wanted by the West Midlands force.

The extent of the problem emerged in 2009 when the Labour Government released numbers of offenders thought to be ‘unlawfully at large’.

But the new figures will raise concerns that police officers are failing to get to grips with the issue.

Peter Cuthbertson, chief executive of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘These shocking figures suggest that we should scale back the release on licence of serious offenders.

‘Too many dangerous criminals are taking it as an opportunity to escape and avoid justice for years. Public safety should come first.

‘Releasing so many killers and sex offenders on licence puts the public at tremendous risk.

‘Every year, a certain number abscond, wasting police time capturing them – or worse, they remain at large. Keeping serious offenders behind bars is important both for justice and for protecting the public.’

Recall: More than 400 criminals who should have been returned to prison after committing fresh crimes or breaking early release rules have been on the run for more than five years

In the most serious cases, police should return the individuals to custody within three days in a process known as ‘emergency recall’.

With less dangerous cases they have up to six days. But the figures show a number of the offenders have been missing for a long time. Most cases are from the last 14 years, but 21 go back to between 1984 and 1999.

Allowing recalled prisoners to remain at large can have disastrous consequences.

In 2009 Dano Sonnex was convicted of the murder of two French students, Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez, in south-east London. It emerged during his trial that he was at large despite having been recalled to jail.

In the past, police forces have refused to name the individuals they are searching for, citing data protection.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the authorities were working ‘tirelessly’ to track the offenders down.

‘Over the last ten years, more than 99 per cent of offenders recalled to custody have been successfully returned to prison,’ he said.

‘Public protection is our priority and the authorities will tirelessly pursue such cases to help ensure these offenders are brought to justice.

‘Where an offender has died we are unable to remove them from the list until we receive a death certificate. Where an offender has fled the country, every effort is made to return them to face justice.’
