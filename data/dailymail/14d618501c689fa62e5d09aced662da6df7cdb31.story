A masked jewellery store raider takes a tumble midway through an audacious gang heist in this incredible footage.

The hapless robber manages to pick himself up and carry on with the raid, in which he and his accomplices made off with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of Indian gold jewellery stuffed into canvas bags.  

In a shocking sequence captured on CCTV  a silver Mercedes SLK 230 smashes through the front window of Gems Jewellers in Coventry, West Midlands, to kick off the audacious raid.

Going, going, gone: One of the raiders slips over on the shiny surface and takes an embarrassing tumble

After he clatters on to the polished tiles, two of his accomplices narrowly avoid running into him as they too struggle to keep their feet in their eagerness to get to the jewellery-laden display cabinets behind

The robber wastes no time in getting back up on his feet and carrying on with the audacious raid

The gang wielded hatchets which they used to smash the glass of the display cabinets holding the jewellery

Three bandits clad all in black then rush in behind the car, which was stolen and using false plates, while a fourth wielding a hatchet jumps out of the passenger seat of the apparently left hand drive vehicle as its driver reverses it back out again.

The thugs are then seen from another camera furiously slipping and sliding on the hard polished floor, with one unable to keep his feet as two of his accomplices narrowly avoid running into him.

Two of the raiders then leapfrog the counter and start smashing display cabinets with axes, just before thick white smoke begins to fill the room after the robbers set off a security device. 

No longer able to see what they are trying to steal, they are forced to flee in a stolen white Audi A3 Sport TDI. 

The gang still managed to make off with a number of canvas bags stuffed with jewellery.

Following the raid, which happened at around 5.20pm on January 29, their getaway driver then sped them off towards Bell Green in the north of the city.

Though the men were masked and dressed in dark clothing detectives still believe people will be able to name them from their distinctive walks, combined with possible boasts about their new found wealth.

West Midlands Police Detective Constable Lee Buckler said: 'This was an audacious raid carried out just as rush hour traffic will have been starting to build and there were lots of witnesses

Three of the raiders burst charge across the tiled floor through the space where the front window used to be

They were carrying canvas bags which they greedily stuffed with expensive Indian gold jewellery

The masked robbers pile in behind the car and head straight for display cabinets holding what they were after

They furiously hack at the glass cases with hatchets, stuffing what they take into canvas bags

'The raiders were masked when they committed the crime but having stolen hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of Indian gold jewellery, their new found wealth combined with their unique floor moves will undoubtedly give them away. 

'As part of the investigation detectives have trawled hours of CCTV footage from cameras in the area and interviewed dozens of witnesses while forensic experts scoured the store and Mercedes abandoned outside. 

'Some may think this is was a victimless crime but I want people to be under no illusion.

'These are dangerous and desperate men who threatened to shoot a man who was passing the store at the time they raided it. 

'The driver of the getaway car also drove dangerously through the streets of Coventry to escape the scene. These men definitely deserve to be behind bars.' 

The owner of the shop was in the store at the time but was physically unharmed. 

Anyone with information which may help Det Con Buckler find the men responsible should call police on 101. 

Information can be given anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

The gang were described as 'dangerous and desperate' by police after they threatened to shoot a man who was passing the store at the time they raided it, before making off at speed through Coventry

The raiders set off a smoke security device which clouded the jewellers and forced them to flee

Police are hoping the criminals' 'unique floor moves' shown in the footage will lead to their arrest
