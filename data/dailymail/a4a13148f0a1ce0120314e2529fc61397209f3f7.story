These incredible self-portraits shot in remote landscapes capture the essence of a young photographer's wanderlust.

Taken across Iceland, Wales and her native Canada, snapper Elizabeth Gadd scouts out breath-taking locations and drops herself right in the middle of her amazing photographs.

In one photo, Elizabeth, from Vancouver, Canada, strides away from the abandoned hull of a plane as snow-tipped mountains watch over in the distance.

Elizabeth Gadd's 'Be Still' image is her favourite and she described it as being one of the 'calmest moments in my life'

Her favourite photo is entitled 'Be Still', where she is stood in the middle of a foggy lake surrounded by mountains.

Elizabeth said: 'I remember it being one of the quietest, calmest experiences of my life.

'I set up the camera on the shore and then walked knee-deep into the cold water and stood still for several minutes.

'Every time the water stilled completely, I would move slightly to create ripples around me for the photos.

'The only other movement around was a small flock of geese quietly floating across the water in the distance.

'With everything so quiet and still, it felt almost as if that moment was frozen and I was suspended in time.'

Ms Gadd's incredible self-portraits are shot in remote landscapes and they capture the essence of the young photographer's wanderlust

The scene of Ms Gadd surrounded by snow-covered mountains and trees in the US state of Oregon is like something out of a fairy tale

Ms Gadd uses a remote control to take the photos and often does several takes to get the light and setting just right

Many of Ms Gadd's photographs involved her running through scenic landscapes; this one is taken in a park in Vancouver, Canada

This incredible image was taken in jungle a forest in Hawaii, where Ms Gadd almost blends in with the tree trunks

As a result of being the subject of her own pictures, self-confessed introvert Elizabeth is often hundreds of metres away from her camera.

She has to use the remote to continually take pictures, but because of the distance the weather and light often change throughout each shoot.

Subsequently, each picture can take up to two hours to perfect before the conditions are just right.

The wonders of nature are beautifully demonstrated in Ms Gadd's stunning set of self-portrait photographs

Elizabeth said: 'There's a lot of running back and forth between the camera and where I want to be in the photo.

'I take a lot of test photos and making sure the scene is how I want it to be but I often find the whole process quite therapeutic.

'I've always loved nature but wanted to challenge myself to take self-portraits to expand my repertoire.

'I am continually awe-struck by nature and the landscapes both humble and inspire me endlessly.

'Hopefully the resulting images depict the feelings of nostalgia, wonder and peace that I regularly feel when I'm out in nature.'
