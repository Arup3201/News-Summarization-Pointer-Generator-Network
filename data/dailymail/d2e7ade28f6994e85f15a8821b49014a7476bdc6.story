Victoria's Secret may be known for its angels, but on Black Friday, it's where angels fear to tread.

An all-out melee erupted at the lingerie giant inside a California shopping mall as customers were let in to commence Black Friday shopping.

What's worse? Thew whole ordeal  at the Roseville Galleria appears to have stemmed from a dispute over panties.

Melee: The brawl began as a fistfight between two women, before three men began throwing punches in the atrium of the Roseville Galleria

Brutality: At one point in the cell phone video, a man can be seen repeatedly kicking another man in the face

The brouhaha got so bad that Victoria's Secret was forced to close while workers cleaned up merchandise that was thrown around the store.

But that couldn't stop the fighting, which spilled into a mall atrium - and got worse.

Lawrence Corpus, who captured the madness on his cell phone camera, told KTXL-TV: 'Basically, I was in the wrong place at the right time.'

On the video from inside the mall, two women can be seen trading punches and wrestling in front of horrified consumers.

Spark: The ordeal arose from a dispute over panties at this Victoria's Secret location

Before long, the confrontation spreads to three men, who crash through a fence while throwing punches.

People can be heard screaming as one of the men begins kicking another shopper in the face.

Jessica Wilbourn, who works at the Victoria's Secret, told KTXL: 'I’ve been in the retail business six years now, and I’ve never see a Black Friday this bad... Some people got trampled on. A 15-year-old was punched in the stomach.'

While an especially good deal may prompt consumers to fight over merchandise, Victoria’s Secret workers told the station that their sales were no different than what the panties usually go for.
