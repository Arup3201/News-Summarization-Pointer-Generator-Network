Daniel Moxen, 27, of Crawley Down, West Sussex, accidentally set fire to his girlfriend during a row which broke out while they were on a train

A roofer who set fire to his girlfriend after they got into a furious row on a train has been spared jail.

Daniel Moxen, 27, had started flicking his cigarette lighter on and off 'in frustration', when the flame suddenly caught onto his girlfriend's cardigan.

The pair, who had been at a concert together, began desperately patting down the flames in front of terrified passengers.

The drama unfolded as the pair were travelling from London Victoria to their home in Redhill, Surrey, in July last year. 

Luckily, the couple, who the court heard had had 'too much to drink', managed to extinguish the flames and no damage was caused. 

Moxen, from Crawley Down, West Sussex, who had 28 previous convictions but none relating to arson, had admitted arson on the first day of his trial last year.

But the court heard Moxen's girlfriend was standing by him and 'wants him to come home'. 

Today, a judge at Guildford Crown Court sentenced Moxen to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months.   

Talking about the victim, defence counsel Irena Ray-Crosby said: 'There was a letter handed in today to Your Honour.

'She has not been allowed to contact the defendant but she is fully in support of him and wants him to come home.

'She is financially dependent on him for the mortgage and he has been meeting her father to pay his share.'

She added that Moxen, who had a 'troubled upbringing', accepts that his behaviour was 'exceptionally foolish'.

She said: 'The couple had both had too much to drink and he was flicking his lighter on and off in a gesture of frustration and he realised he could smell burning and it was her cardigan.

'Happily no-one was hurt and there was no damage to people or property.'  

The father-of-one, dressed in a white shirt and grey blazer, stared straight ahead as the judge passed sentence.

Judge Neil Stewart said: 'You accept you argued with the complainant and felt agitated, you relieved your stress by flicking a lighter.

'As soon as you realised what had happened, you patted down the flames.

The incident broke out after the flame from the lighter (right) caught onto the girlfriend's cardigan as the pair were travelling from London Victoria (left) to their home in Redhill, Surrey (file pictures)

'This all happened on a train and other passengers were unsurprisingly alarmed.

'This is a serious offence. The consequences of causing a fire speak for themselves. Terrible things can and do happen. Fortunately in this case, no harm was caused.'

Moxen must also complete a six-month supervision requirement and pay £400 costs.
