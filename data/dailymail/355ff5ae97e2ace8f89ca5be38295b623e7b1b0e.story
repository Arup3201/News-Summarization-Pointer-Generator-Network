The FBI swooped on three properties including the homes of a former NFL star and his brother as part of an ongoing criminal investigation.

Swarms of agents and local law enforcement officers arrived at the home of tackle Jason Fabini and his brother Michael in Fort Wayne, Indiana, yesterday.

They removed several boxes from a garage and sent in a police dog - but the FBI remained tight-lipped on what they found or what the investigation relates to.

Concern: Former New York Jets star Jason Fabini denies being involved in any criminal activity after the FBI raided properties belonging to him and his brother Michael

Jason Fabini, who was drafted by the New York Jets in 1998 and last played for the Washington Redskins in 2008, has denied being involved in any criminal activity.

A spokesperson for the FBI said that the investigation is part of the Safe Streets Task Forces programme which aims to tackle violent crime, according to the agency's website.

Neighbours told The Journal Gazette that the property has grown in size considerably in recent years.

They also said they had become suspicious when security cameras appeared on the outside of the house and an electricity generator was placed nearby.

Yesterday afternoon Jason Fabini, 38, 
issued a statement through an attorney, expressing his concern for his 
brother and the rest of his family.

'I have cooperated fully with 
authorities, and will continue to do so. I have not been charged, nor do
I expect to be charged with a crime,' he said. 'I 
expect the community will have many questions as rumors circulate and 
this investigation continues, but I ask that we trust in the authorities
to do their job.'

Jason Fabini played high school football at Bishop Dwenger high school in Fort Wayne and later attended the University of Cincinnati where he was a three-time All Star USA selection.
