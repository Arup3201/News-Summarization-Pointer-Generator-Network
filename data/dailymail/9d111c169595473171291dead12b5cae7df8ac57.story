It’s a well-known fact that a dog is a man’s best friend, and one baby girl has got a pretty close bond with her canine companion too.

Two-year-old Weiwei plays with her huge pet Tibetan mastiff like he’s a big cuddly toy and despite his daunting appearance, he’s happy to go along with it.

Called Simba after the star of the Lion King, the huge dog simply lolls on the floor blissfully while the little girl crawls around in his golden mane, cooing gleefully as this cute video shows.

Tibetan mastiffs were originally bred as guard dogs by nomads who wanted to protect their camps in Central Asia, but now they've become a status symbol in China.

One man recently paid a whopping £1.2 million for one of the golden-haired beasts - who really must have had a mane of gold to warrant that sum.

The puppy went under the hammer at a luxury pet fair in Hangzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang earlier this year and is believed to be the most anyone has ever paid for a pet dog. 

What's clear here is that this little girl is in the lap of luxury as she plays in her pet's gorgeous fur coat. 

Don't mind me! Baby Weiwei clambers over Simba while the big dog snoozes, nonplussed by the little girl
