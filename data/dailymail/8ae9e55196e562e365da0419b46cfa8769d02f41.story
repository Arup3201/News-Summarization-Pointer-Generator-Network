Miami Beach was the stage, renowned chefs prepared the food and a drag queen DJ set the tunes.

This was the scene at celebrity chef Art Smith's massive gay wedding this weekend, where he invited 101 couples to wed in a free ceremony to celebrate a lift on the state's ban on same-sex marriage. 

The wedding was officiated by chef Guy Fieri and the seven-tier gold cake was made by Duff Goldman, star of the Food Network reality show Ace of Cakes.

Smith, a former chef to Oprah Winfrey, said he was inspired by the film 101 Dalmatians - more specifically its villain - when he decided on the number of couples to invite.

He called Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who plans to appeal the legalization ruling and is a staunch opponent against same-sex marriage, the state's own 'Cruella De Vil'. 

Smith told his guests on the dance floor that he wanted to show the haters 'we're proud, we're happy, we're loud' with the party 

'She was determined that she was going to prevent equality from coming to Florida,' Smith said, according to the Associated Press. 

'For a state known for sunshine, it was living in the darkness when it came to LGBT rights and it was important to acknowledge that.' 

Smith has been hosting the Big Gay Ice Cream Social in Miami for years in protest to the state's same-sex marriage ban. 

He told his guests on the dance floor that he wanted to show the haters 'we're  proud, we're happy, we're loud' with a party.

The wedding was also personal for Smith. The chef met his partner, Jesus Salgueiro, in Miami 15 years ago while he was out buying flowers for Winfrey's home. 

They married five years ago on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. 

Friends flew in from California and Indianapolis to see couple Nicole Griffin, 43, and Stephanie Swanson, 42, tie the knot.

Swanson told the Associated Press she believed the wedding represented a 'defeat' for Pam Bondi, who Swanson said had denied them 'for so long' in her fight against marriage equality. 

Seth Anderson and Michael Ferguson had legally wed in a Utah courthouse two years before, but joined the ceremony so they could renew their vows at a proper wedding. 

'We wanted to come and be a part of this and celebrate with all the other people getting married,' Anderson said. 

Fieri officiated the ceremony in honor of his late sister, who was a lesbian. 

Fellow Food Network star Goldman also made the wedding's massive feast, which included fried chicken, grilled lamb, crab-stuffed avocados and empanadas. 

Goldman, who is a gay rights advocate, said he wanted to help celebrate and make the new law 'true in every state'.
