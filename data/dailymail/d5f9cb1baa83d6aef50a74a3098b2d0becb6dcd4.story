Gary Neville says fans must forget about the 'Manchester United way' and place their trust in manager Louis van Gaal's philosophy.

The 20-time English champions have struggled for consistency this season after the Dutchman replaced David Moyes in the summer, but still lie third in the Premier League table.

Van Gaal has been criticised by supporters and pundits alike for his tactical stubbornness, with many suggesting he should revert to a quicker style of play to mirror Sir Alex Ferguson's great side.

Manchester United must get used to their new style of play under Louis van Gaal, according to Gary Neville

But former defender and Sky Sports pundit Neville insists the Ferguson reign should be forgotten  if United want to move forward.

'The time has come for Manchester United fans – me included – to let go of the Sir Alex Ferguson reign and stop judging this new era by former glories,' Neville said in the Telegraph. 'The style of play and the names have changed, but the one person not confused by the team’s development will be Louis van Gaal.

'I’ve never been a manager, but I personally believe in attacking football, with a high tempo. If United were committed to protecting that style of play at all costs they should have appointed a manager with those beliefs. But there was no way Van Gaal was going to come to Manchester United and adopt somebody else’s philosophy.

'It’s a bit like breaking up with a partner of 26 years and wanting the new person to be the same as the old one. They – we – are going to have to let go. The idea of referencing Ferguson or saying "It’s not the Manchester United way" at every turn stylistically is not going to take Manchester United anywhere.'

Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Van Gaal have admitted that Champions League qualification is a must this year after missing out on Europe all together last season.

But United face a battle for a top-four spot over the next three months, with Southampton, Arsenal Tottenham and Liverpool all closing in.

Neville says a 14-day period in March with matches against Tottenham and Liverpool with the league as well as Arsenal in an FA Cup quarter-final will be do-or-die for Van Gaal.

'Definitive opinions remain elusive. You can say momentarily: good performance, bad performance; this player played well, this one played badly.' 

'But we are moving out of that hazy period, to a 14-day spell in March when opinions can harden. Arsenal in the FA Cup and Tottenham (home) and Liverpool (away) in the league. 

'To reach an FA Cup semi-final and pick up four league points in those games would put United within striking range of ending the season on a high. Those results go wrong, and this could be a baptism of fire for Louis Van Gaal in his first season.'
