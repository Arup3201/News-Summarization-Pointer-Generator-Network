Theresa May has been criticised by the opposition after the collapse of a sham marriage trial

Home Secretary Theresa May has come under fire for ‘unbelievable’ failures over sham marriages.

Labour’s immigration spokesman David Hanson criticised the Home Office’s inability to get on top of the problem and accused ministers of mismanaging the situation.

His comments came following the collapse of a trial of an imam accused of conducting 580 sham marriages, after the Home Office failed to hand over paperwork in time.

Mr Hanson called on Mrs May to ‘make clear what steps she will be taking to ensure this doesn’t happen again’.

He added: ‘Sham marriages undermine public trust in our immigration system and can present a serious threat to our borders.

‘So it’s unbelievable that officials on Theresa May’s watch can’t be bothered to do the paperwork on time to prosecute someone who might be responsible for sham marriages on an almost industrial scale.

'It’s a clear sign of the mismanagement by ministers that vital work to ensure someone engaging in defrauding the country with sham marriages wasn’t done in time and means no further action can be taken.

'I share the public’s anger at such poor management by ministers and think the Home Secretary needs to make clear what steps she’ll be taking to ensure this doesn’t happen again.’ 

Mohammed Mattar, 62, was due to stand trial at Isleworth Crown Court after he was said to have presided over bogus weddings at his Islamic bookshop in west London.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the charges after government investigators missed deadlines to hand over vital information. 

MPs warned earlier this year in a report that bogus marriages are increasing at an ‘alarming rate’, with as many as 10,000 a year feared to be carried out.

They called it an ‘industry of deceit’.

In July, the Home Affairs Select Committee questioned whether the Government knew the ‘scale of the problem’ and called for better training for registrars to spot sham marriages.

Registrars told the committee they were left presiding over what they knew to be a ‘charade’, and were powerless to stop it.

The trials of Mohammed Mattar, left, and Reverend Nathan Ntege, right, both collapsed, apparently due to Home Office blunders

A TV documentary also showed the ease with which migrants could marry to get a British passport.

An undercover journalist exposed the scale of the problem by meeting her Indian ‘fiance’, Ali, through a self-styled bogus marriage ‘fixer’ online – and agreeing to marry him for £5,000.

He and reporter Harriet Morter were allowed to wed even though Ali forgot his bride’s name and claimed he could not remember the borough where she lived.

It was called off at the last minute. 

The number of suspicious marriages reported had rocketed in the early years of the last Labour government, but plummeted in 2005 when non-EU nations were required to apply to the Home Office to marry.

But the numbers reported have crept up since then from 934 in 2010 to 2,135 last year.

This year John Vine, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, told the select committee the ‘widespread abuse of the system was ‘one of the biggest potential threats to immigration control’ and claimed there were no proper checks.

In the Channel 5 programme, screened last night, Mark Rimmer, the superintendent registrar at Brent Council said the number of sham marriages was ‘absolutely enormous’.
