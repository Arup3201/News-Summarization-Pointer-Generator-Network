To the untrained eye, this property may look like a garage.

But according to estate agent Winkworth, it’s a ‘one-bedroom studio’ – and it’s on the market for £250,000.

The former garage in Highgate in north London is going for same price as a six-bedroom detached house in Barnsley or a four-bedroom villa with pool in Alicante.

Des res: The former garage is nestled in North London's Highgate Village

It boasts a kitchenette – which appears 
to be a sink and hob atop a small fridge and one cupboard – as well as a
 small bathroom.

The property, which measures 224sq ft is also available to rent at £300 a week and can be used as an office.

Winkworth estate agents said that the owner does not want any publicity for the property and has removed the listing 'in order to clarify and make clear of the usage rights', a spokesman said.

For those still unconvinced that London is on its way to a property bubble, a converted garage is arguably a tell-tale sign. 

it is situated in a mews off Highgate High Street, where just down the road a six bedroom house will set you back £25million.

Light and airy: The room has been fitted out with a little window and skylights

In another strong sign that the property
 market is strengthening, new research released today revealed that the 
number of properties available for sale that have been discounted has 
fallen sharply over the past 12 months.

The proportion of properties on the market with an asking price that has been reduced at least once has fallen from 37 per cent last year to 32 per cent today, according to research from Zoopla.

Buyers are even less likely to bag a discount in London. The capital continues to have the lowest proportion of discounted properties on the market with less than a quarter (22.8 per cent) seeing their asking price reduced once they are listed for sale.

Meanwhile properties in Barnsley are most likely to be reduced – 42.7 per cent are currently on sale for lower than their original price.

Conversion: The space has been fitted out with a shower and toilet

The average asking price of a home in England and Wales has jumped by around £20,000 since the beginning of the year, a report revealed yesterday.

A typical home advertised for sale in an estate agent’s window now has a price tag of £250,000.

The sharp increase comes amid growing concern that Government schemes to boost the housing market may be fuelling another house price bubble. 

At the beginning of January the average 
asking price was £228,989. Today it is £249,199, a jump of £20,210, 
according to the report from Rightmove.

In London, the affordability crisis 
facing anybody wanting to get onto the housing ladder, or move to a 
larger home, is even more acute.

On the market: For the same price you could buy this six-bedroom detached house in Barnsley

Or this...: This four-bedroom villa with pool in Alicante, Spain, costs just over five grand more at £255,673

The average asking price in London hit £501,067 this month, compared to £454,875 in the same month last year, according to Rightmove.

The garage-turned-home may be expensive but it's cheaper than a Hyde Park parking space.

A parking space was put on the market two weeks ago for a record-breaking £300,000 - almost twice the price of the average UK home.

The spot in London's exclusive Hyde Park Gardens measures just 11ft x 12ft, but its price tag is almost double the £162,000 paid for the average house sold in England and Wales last month.

Estate agents Kay & Co, who last year sold two nearby parking spaces for £250,000 each, said several people had already expressed an interest in snapping up the six-figure spot.

The agent said parking spaces are in hot demand in Hyde Park Gardens, where houses cost up to £15million.

Its buyer will be paying £1,299 per square foot for the privilege of owning a central space in Westminster.
