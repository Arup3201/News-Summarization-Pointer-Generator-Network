A woman who thought she had met her perfect man online has issued a stark warning to other lonely hearts after losing more than £1,000 to an online con artist.

And in a cruel twist, when Lori Martorana, 41, from London, confronted the man, he replied with an email saying how much he was enjoying spending her money.

'I don’t consider myself naïve and I 
never thought something like this would happen to me so it’s important 
that I let other women know even though it’s embarrassing to admit,' 
said Lori.

Duped: Lori Martorana (above) was conned by a man who used this stolen photo of a real soldier to woo her

'We’d been 
talking for months and exchanged hundreds of emails before cash was 
mentioned and by that time my guard was down. If he’d asked immediately I
would have known.'

The scam began after office manager Lori joined dating website Love2Meet and spent £79 on a profile on the site.

After a month, she was contacted by a man purporting to be Michael Kolb, an officer serving with the US Army in Afghanistan. His picture showed a handsome man in Army fatigues.

Initially though, Lori was unimpressed. 'I liked his photograph but there didn’t seem much point because he lived the other side of the world,' she said. 'I replied to his message out of politeness and we soon got chatting.’

But despite her initial reluctance, 'Michael', who described himself as a 45-year-old widower with grown-up children, swiftly started to become an important part of Lori's life.

'The more we talked the more I liked him,' she admits. 'We exchanged private email addresses and soon we were in contact every day.'

Devastated: Lori has decided to make her story public in the hopes that no one else will fall for a similar scam

Sometimes Michael had to go offline urgently, but as he was serving in a war zone, it appeared to make sense to the besotted Lori.

'We grew closer the more we got to know each other. The distance seemed less of an issue because he was due to retire anyway.'

After eight weeks, Michael told Lori he had strong feelings for her and she admitted she felt the same.

Then, when he told her he had some leave coming up and wanted to travel to the UK to meet her in person, she agreed and says she was 'thrilled' that she would at last meet her online match.

'He wasn’t pushy, he just said it would be nice to spend time together and get to know each other properly,' said Lori, adding: 'I was thrilled.'

But her joy wasn't to last. Before he could travel to the UK, said Michael, his superior officers would need to know more about her for 'security reasons'.

Unsuspecting, Lori agreed, and when a few days later an email asking for personal and contact information arrived, she had no reason to think it wasn't from a fellow officer as claimed.

Convincing: Along with stolen photos of serving soldiers, the conman also sent shots like this one

Apology: 'Michael' even apologised for the intrusion before asking Lori to hand over more than £1000

Michael even wrote to apologise for the intrusion and assured her it would be worth it once his leave was granted.

Then, out of the blue, she received an email saying the trip would only be approved if she paid a security deposit of £1150 to guarantee his return.

'I was surprised to say the least but Michael said it was common in the US Army to stop soldiers going AWOL,' said Lori.

According to Michael, Lori would have the cash returned when he rejoined his unit in Afghanistan.

She agreed to make an online transfer to the account details he provided and began preparing happily for his visit. 'I was so excited to meet him and started getting ready for his visit,' she adds.

Then, another email arrived. Only, it didn't, as expected, contain details of his visit. Instead, it was a demand for a further £400.

'This time the alarm bells rang straight away,' says Lori. 'I started thinking about all the information and cash I had already sent.'

Panicking, Lori called her bank but found it was too late to stop the transfer. 'They told me to go to the police,' she says. 'As I gave the police officer my statement I felt such a fool.

Swiftly, Michael's story began to unravel. He was not, as he had claimed a member of the US Army. In fact, he didn't exist at all.

The police revealed that photos, supposedly of himself, that he’d sent to Lori had been stolen and that the man in the pictures had been a victim of identity theft.

'I asked him if he was enjoying spending my hard earned money.'

Astonishingly, the conman replied, saying: 'yes thanks'.

The loving emails had been crafted by a scammer interested in nothing more than her cash.

Distraught, Lori emailed the dating site but as his profile had already been removed and his membership terminated there was nothing they could do.

She continued to email 'Michael' in the vague hope of uncovering information that might help police return her money but all she got was requests for more.

Eventually, she snapped. 'I emailed him telling him I knew the truth, that he was nothing more than a con artist,' she said. 'I asked him if he was enjoying spending my hard earned money.'

Astonishingly, the conman replied, saying: 'yes thanks.'

Lori was furious. 'I couldn’t believe the cheek of it,' she says. 'I was devastated and angry beyond words. He was taunting me.'

'I never ever thought something like this could happen to me and I still can’t believe I was so stupid.

'I’m ashamed and embarrassed but I don’t think I am the first or the last to fall for this so I want to warn other women who think they are talking to soldiers.

'They may not have asked for cash yet, it may take several months like it did with me. If you can’t meet them they might not be real. I fell for a man that didn’t even exist. That hurts just as much as the money.'

She added: 'If speaking out stops one more women being conned it’s worth it.'

Asked to comment, dating agency Love2Meet said: 'Scams are something we take very seriously. Our moderation team works 24/7 to ensure our members are safe from scammers.

'Occasionally, one may slip through the net. We would like to apologise to Lori for any distress or upset this may have caused.'
