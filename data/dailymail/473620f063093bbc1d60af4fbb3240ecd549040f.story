A caravan was left with huge holes in its roof and floor when a shard of frozen human waste plunged through the vehicle after falling from a passing plane.

The huge icicle crashed through restaurant owner Caroline Guy's static caravan leaving an 18-inch hole.

Miss Guy, 52, was woken up by what she thought was an 'explosion' on Saturday morning, initially thinking she was being burgled.\

Damage: Miss Guy, pictured left holding some of the ice fragments, initially thought she was being burgled after hearing a loud 'explosion', but later found the damaged bathroom in the caravan (right)

The mother-of-two investigated her home but could not find anything suspicious until later that day when she went to clean the static caravan which is positioned on her land.

It was then that she discovered the hole in the caravan's roof, aw sell as another similar hole in its floor.

Miss Guy found smashed ice all over the inside of the caravan and a massive lump on the ground underneath, which she has now kept in her freezer.

The frozen block of ice had fallen from 
the sky and smashed through the caravan above the bathroom,  ripping 
lights off the ceiling and a mirror from the wall.

Leaky: A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority admitted that the ice was probably the result of a 'leak' from a plane

Miss Guy, from Pattingham, Staffordshire, was in the process of trying to sell the caravan for £5,000  but she says it is now worthless.

A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority admitted that the ice was probably the result of a 'leak' from a plane - and possibly from the lavatories.

Miss Guy said: 'It is just a miracle that neither myself or my children were in there when it came crashing down - it could have killed someone.

'I heard a loud bang at 7am and thought someone was kicking the front door in but when I went downstairs there was nothing.'

She added: 'The block of ice must have been 18 inches in size as that's the size of the hole. There is another hole the same size in the floor.

'There was brown and yellow ice all over the place. It had been six or seven hours and it still hadn't all melted - it must have been massive.

Miss Guy said that nobody was liable, according to the Civil Aviation Authority, but she said 'someone should be - I could have died'.

She lived lived in the 32ft by 12ft caravan for two years while she had a barn converted on her land and moved out in November.

She lives on a flight path 40 miles from Birmingham Airport and thinks the ice fell from one of the many planes that regularly flies over her home.

A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said such falling blocks do happen 'now and then'.

He said: 'What happens is there is some sort of leak on the plane and a body of water builds up on the outside.

Deadly: The mother-of-two said that she wanted somebody to accept liability as she 'could have been killed'

'When the plane is at height it freezes and then when the plane starts to descend it heats up and starts to thaw and falls off.

'The source of the leaks are one of three - the toilet facilities, the air conditioning or running water.

'These incidents are very rare but they do happen now and then.'

The spokesman said the CAA would be checking with flight companies to see which service was flying overhead at the time so maintenance checks can be carried out.

Over the past 40 years there have been five recorded cases of people being hit by 'waste' ice from plane toilets.

In 2009, Bristol pensioner David Gammon, 76, was bruised when a lump of ice the size of a grapefruit landed in his lap as he sat in his garden.
