Arrested: Dr Mohsen Hosseinkhani allegedly broke into the center and rearranged lab rats

A furious doctor is said to have broken into his former medical centre to rearrange lab rats and steal scientific materials from former colleagues, it has been reported.

Dr Mohsen Hosseinkhani, 40, allegedly sought revenge after losing his fellowship at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.

The researcher ‘moved all the animals [lab rats] around from cage to cage so they didn’t know which was which’, it was claimed today.

Dr. Hosseinkhani was arrested on Tuesday and charged with burglary and grand larceny, with sources claiming his motive was losing his cardiology-fellowship program in June.

The source told the New York Post: ‘His work was lacking compared to the others in his group.’

Dr Hosseinkhani allegedly broke into the center on July 1 and also is accused of taking stem-cell cultures and antibodies, along with other materials, according to a Manhattan Criminal Court complaint.

The scientific materials taken are said to be worth $10,000 and allegedly included a cancerous chemical.

He apparently returned once more to the medical center on November 28 to take additional pipettes, which are used to transport liquids, the newspaper reported.

The complaint on court papers reads: ‘[Hosseinkhani] did not have permission or authority to enter into the areas of the above location on either July 1, 2011, or Nov. 28, 2011.’

A statement released by Mount Sinai Medical Center said: ‘Mr. Mohsen Hosseinkhani was a post-doctoral fellow engaged in research until June 2011, and had no contact with patients.

‘Mount Sinai will continue to cooperate with the investigation.’

Hosseinkhani claims on his LinkedIn profile that he received a PhD in Cardiac Regeneration from Harvard Medical School and it still lists him as a current medical doctor at Mount Sinai Hospital Foundation.

The doctor is scheduled to appear at court next week and was released on bail on Wednesday.
