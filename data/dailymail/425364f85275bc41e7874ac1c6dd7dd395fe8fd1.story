The Duchess of Cornwall today made an appearance at the Badminton Horse Trials to hand out trophies to the winners.

Camilla, looking glamorous in a cream shirt dress with pearls at her ears and her hair in a youthful flicked style, looked to be in good spirits as she arrived at the Gloucestershire meet earlier today.

The duchess, who has a lifelong love of equestrian sports, was in attendance in her position of patron of the British Equestrian Federation to present the awards at the end of the jumping portion of the Trials.

Her fellow royals had been out in force at the event this week to watch Zara Phillips compete in a number of events.

But after making a mistake on the cross country course yesterday, the Queen's eldest granddaughter was forced to retire from remaining events meaning she did not compete in today's showjumping as previously planned.

The 31-year-old Olympic silver medallist had been watched by her mother Princess Anne, brother Peter Phillips, 35, his wife of four years Autumn and their two daughters, Savannah, two, and Isla, one, as she competed in the cross country event yesterday.

Riding her horse High 
Kingdom, Zara crashed into a fence at the water jump and was forced to pull out of the Trials entirely.

Zara, who is married to English rugby 
player Mike Tindall, has been participating in the competition since 
Thursday.

She posted a dressage score of 44.3 penalties on Saturday putting her in a strong position until the moment High Kingdom stumbled at the jump.

Reflecting on British equestrian’s 
feelgood factor post-London, the team silver medal winner said:

‘Everyone who was there at London, and those of us who were lucky enough
 to be able to ride there, it was just the most amazing experience. We 
want to try to keep that going.’

The
 sportswoman also saluted the ‘unbelievable’ achievement of her fellow 
British Olympian William Fox-Pitt and New Zealander Andrew Nicholson in 
challenging for eventing’s richest prize.

Not only are they bidding for Badminton’s £65,000 winners’ purse, but also the £230,000 Rolex Grand Slam.

The Grand Slam has only been won once before - by Britain’s Pippa Funnell 10 years ago.

It is awarded to any rider who wins consecutive Burghley, Kentucky and Badminton titles.

Zara
 said: ‘To maintain your performance at the top level is difficult 
anyway, but to do it in three of the five competitions is unbelievable.

‘But
 everyone is going to be trying to stop them. They are going to have to 
put their best performances out there to try to win it.
