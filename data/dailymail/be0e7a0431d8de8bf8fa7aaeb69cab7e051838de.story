For a year-and-a-half, Omar Kenawi and Susan Schlegel travelled back and forth between London and Los Angeles after meeting online and falling hopelessly in love.

At 5,437 miles apart, the couple's relationship was just about as long-distance as it gets - but Mr Kenawi used that to his advantage.

Knowing that his Broadway-loving girlfriend's favourite musical was Rent, he coordinated a surprise flashmob for her which culminated on him getting down on one knee.

Luckily for him, in front of the flash mob that he had arranged and the crowd that gathered to watch the romantic gesture, as well as the camera crew he had brought in to record the proposal, she said yes.

Moment of relief: After travelling from London to Los Angeles and organising an elaborate proposal, Susan Schlegel said yes to Omar Kenawi

Ms Schlegel and her husband-to-be had not seen each other for four months before he popped the question

'Sue's favourite musical is Rent which I hadn't seen, so I watched it and loved it,' Mr Kenawi, 28, told ABC News.

'I picked my favourite song from the show, Seasons of Love, and I really wanted to make it special to us so I rewrote the lyrics to be more personal to our unique relationship.'

The original song's lyrics ask: 'Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes. How do you measure, measure a year?'

After finding out the distance from London to Los Angeles, the producer changed the words to: 'Five thousand, four hundred and thirty seven miles. How do you measure the distance of love?' and renamed the song Forever Love.

The happy couple kiss and Mr Kenawi's huge trip and elaborate plan have all been worth it

Mr Kenawi, who had not seen his girlfriend for four months before the proposal, relied on the help of Ms Schlegel's close friends and family to pull off the stunt - a group of around 35 all together.

Ms Schlegel was led to Griffith Observatory, where the couple had spent a romantic evening in the past, under the impression that she was there for a marketing job.

But when she was led outside, an a cappella group start to sing.

Bemused, Ms Schlegel says, 'I love this,' as she watches the group  break out into song. 

Meanwhile a nervous Mr Kenawi hides just a few feet away, preparing himself for one of the most daunting moments of his life.

As friends of Ms Schlegel begin to join the group she starts dancing, still completely oblivious to what is about to happen.

At this point Mr Kenawi bites the bullet and emerges from behind, emerging in time to sing the final verse of his song.

Happy couple: The pair have not set a wedding date yet, but after such an elaborate proposal, Ms Schlegel wants to plan a more 'intimate' ceremony

Speaking to her after the music stops, he says: 'I have travelled 5,437 miles to stand here before you today, but I would travel to the ends of the universe to be with you.

'Every minute without you has been an eternity, and every bumpy plane ride has been an absolute pleasure.

'You are the most beautiful, funny, thoughtful, and inspiring woman I have ever known, and I ever will know. 

'You are my soulmate, my partner, my best friend, and you would make me the happiest man alive if you would give me the honour of sharing your life with me.'

Mr Kenawi then gets down on one knee and pops the question, to which Ms Schlegel says yes as the crowd break into applause. 

'Months of planning all hinged on that moment, and the excitement and elation we all felt at its success was something I'll never experience again,' Kenawi recalled. 'It was the best moment of my life.

'I was really nervous as months of planning had gone into that moment and I wanted to make it like a dream come true for her.

'She told me one of her wishes was to find herself in a musical scenario in her life and I wanted to make that happen for her.'  

The happy couple have not set a wedding date yet, but after such an elaborate proposal, Ms Schlegel says they would like to 'plan something intimate and unique,' about a year from now.
