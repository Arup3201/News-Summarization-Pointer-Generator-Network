A British teenager on a gap year has been found dead in Colombia after taking a hallucinogenic drug in a tribal ritual.

Henry Miller, 19, who was due to go to university in September, had travelled to a remote rainforest area in the long-troubled South American country and taken 'Yage', which induces vivid hallucinations and supposedly spiritual experiences.

The youngster took the drug twice with a local tribe, and collapsed on the second occasion.

Hours later Henry's body was dumped on a lonely dirt road.

His corpse was later found there on Wednesday, and photographed for a grim image on a local news website.

Colombian police are now investigating the death, and the people who supplied Henry with Yage, which was said by one local to kill a couple of people there every year.

Henry, from Bristol, had been travelling round South America for some months, but only recently arrived in the remote town of Mocoa in the Putumayo region.

Around a week ago he booked in to the Casa del Rio hostel there. The hostel continues to list the taking of the potentially lethal hallucinogen on its 'things to do' web page, saying: 'experience Yag√©, Indian tradition taking a medicinal plant which purifies and can make you hallucinate'.

The young Briton, who appears to have been travelling alone but had made friends on his travels, first drank the drug on Sunday without suffering apparent harm, then took it again on Tuesday.

Henry travelled a short distance from his hostel to take the drug on the land of a shaman named as Guillemo Mavisoy Mutumbajoy from the Kamentsa tribe, among a small group of other tourists from around the world.

There was one local report that Henry fell unconscious at around 3am on Wednesday morning, and that attempts were made to revive him with a nettle ointment said to be an antidote to Yage.

One source was reported as telling a local Colombian news site: 'A couple of people die every year from taking Yage. I can't say very much as there is a police investigation.

'Henry was a very decent polite young man who looked more like a student than a hippy. He was not the sort of person you would expect that would take Yage.'

The source added that Miller, who was travelling alone but had met others on his south American journey, may have been talked into taking the potentially lethal herbal cocktail.

He revealed that Miller took part in the drug taking ritual twice while he was in Mocoa, with just one day between sessions, and 'was planning to travel on but changed his mind to go and take it again'.

Investigators from the Colombian Attorney General's Office removed the body to Mocoa to establish the cause of death.

A UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national on 23 April in Colombia. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
