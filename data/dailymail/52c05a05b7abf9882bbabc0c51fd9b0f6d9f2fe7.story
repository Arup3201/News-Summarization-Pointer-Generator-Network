Italian winemakers have threatened to launch legal action against British pubs and bars which serve prosecco on tap

Italian winemakers have threatened to launch legal action against British pubs and bars which serve prosecco on tap.

The group, backed by the Italian government, has warned that establishments could face fines of up to 20,000 euros unless they stop the 'illegal' trade of selling the sparkling drink from kegs.

They insist that selling the fizzy wine in the same manner as lager or cider is illegal under EU laws, which state the drink must be sold by the bottle.

The producers also say that drinking prosecco on tap ruins the taste of the drink and is causing damage to the industry's reputation. 

The consortium has now contacted the UK's Food Standards Agency and Intellectual Property Office in a bid to crack down on the new craze.

They warn that those who refuse to stop the trade could be taken to court under European Union trading regulations and prosecuted for 'fraud'.

Luca Giavi, the director of the consortium of winemakers in the Valdobbiadene-Conegliano area of the northern Veneto region, told The Telegraph:  'If prosecco is sold on tap then it is no longer prosecco – it needs to be served directly from the bottle.

'We're just trying to protect consumers – if they order a glass of prosecco, then that it what they should be getting.' 

The winemakers say that, under a European law from 2009, it is illegal to sell prosecco on tap and that it should be 'marketed exclusively in traditional glass bottles'.   

They have been backed by the Italian government, with one MP saying politicians will 'act immediately' to see how they 'can best discourage further violations'. 

Michele Anzaldi, an MP from the Democratic Party of Matteo Renzi, the prime minister, described it as a 'very serious abuse'.

He said: 'It's one thing to drink prosecco, a protected brand, but quite another to drink pseudo-wine pumped with carbon dioxide, as seems to be served in some British pubs.' 

The Priory Bar in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, is one of those pubs which has introduced prosecco on tap at the establishment. 

But owner Marcus Hilton said he was forced to change the the name of the sparking wine to 'frizzante' after officials from the Food Standards Agency said he was in breach of EU regulations.

The winemakers say that serving the fizzy drink in the same manner as lager and cider is bad for the reputation of the industry. Pictured: An Italian vineyard in Tuscany

He still supplies about 200 other venues with the wine and he says it is possible that not all the venues have done the same.

He told The Independent: 'I’m now calling it frizzante. But obviously I can’t answer for the other 200 or so people I’m supplying it to,' 

Last year, Britain became the top export market for prosecco, overtaking Germany. Sales increased dramatically over Christmas and New Year.  

Demand for the popular fizz has rocketed to the point where it is being mass produced on a grand scale in factories in northern Italy.

Locals pay around four or five euros (£3.31 to £3.92) for the low-quality bubbly but the price almost doubles by the time it gets to Britain.

Traditional producers also say taste is being substituted for quantity as large cooperatives compete to satisfy Britain’s insatiable thirst for the drink. 

In some cases, producers are even topping up cheap ‘bulk wine’ with super-strength concentrate to make it more alcoholic after poor weather this summer affected the grapes.  

This summer, the harvest had been hit by bad weather leading to a 30 per cent drop in grapes.
