What a difference a week makes. After the defeat at Lord’s it felt like the entire country was against us but the reception we — and Alastair Cook in particular — got at Southampton last week made us realise just how much goodwill there is for us.

I don’t think I’ve ever seen or heard a reception like the one Cooky got just for scoring 48 not out at lunch. 

He’s had some personal stick from a couple of people recently but to get that kind of support from the crowd was such a great boost for him and the entire team.

I was far happier with my own performance in a team display that reminded me of when we were at our dominant best against India three years ago. 

To win every session of the match is unusual and it was satisfying to respond to the loss at Lord’s in such a positive fashion.

I was determined to be aggressive and express myself and put all my knee issues to one side. It’s like when you tell a kid not to spill a drink when they walk into a room — all they will think about is spilling the drink! 

At Lord’s I fell into the trap of thinking ‘my knee is sore’. I think it worked because the knee felt as good as it has all year.

Teamwork: Moeen Ali holds up the match ball as he celebrates taking his fifth wicket during the third Test

At Lord’s I was having hot baths in the middle of the night just to get some warmth through it but I can honestly say that I’m more confident about getting through all five Tests than I have been at any point this summer.

Having Cooky back in form is a massive boost. None of us had any doubt he would come through because he’s a world-class player and that’s what they do. Let’s hope he can score a couple of hundreds to set up a series win.

Moeen Ali gets better with every match and is now a really strong option with the ball. I’ve known him for a number of years and he’s great to have in the dressing room. In Test cricket you’ve got to learn on the job because it is so much more intense than county cricket. Moeen’s really doing that and that is a great testament to him.

A word on Jos Buttler, too. What a terrific debut! Early days but very promising.
