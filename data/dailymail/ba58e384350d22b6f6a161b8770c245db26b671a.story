With its windows smashed-in, and an overgrown garden surrounding it, nothing better represents the sad decline of Ireland's economy than this unfortunate house.

Set in 2.32 acres, and with five-bedrooms, it was bought for €3.3million (£2.7m) during a fierce bidding battle at the height of the property boom.

But now, following a disastrous period for the country's economy, the property is on the market for just  €395,000 (£325,500).

Sad decline: This five-bedroom house was bought for 3.3million euros during a fierce bidding battle at the height of the property boom but is now worth just 395,000 euros

On the market: This 4,080 sq ft house in Tullamore, Co. Offaly, was bought in 2006 by developers intent on building a 60-bed nursing home

It represents the appalling state of the current housing market in Ireland and its wider economy, which has required a £70 billion bailout from the EU and International Monetary Fund.

The 4,080 sq ft house in Tullamore, Co. Offaly, was bought in 2006 by developers intent on building a 60-bed nursing home.

However, Property Partners Richard Cleary are now advertising the house for €395,000 – an 87 per cent drop in price.

‘I have a great degree of sympathy with the purchasers, they were very unfortunate as through no fault of their own the entire property market turned in 2007,’ Mr Cleary said.

While €3.3million might seem like a 
colossal price in hindsight, it was an accurate reflection of the market
value at the time, he said.

The
buyers planned to take advantage of generous Government tax breaks on 
offer for nursing home developments. Permission was granted for a 60-bed
nursing home at the site.

‘Tax breaks for nursing homes ceased in 2009, but seeing as the site has been discounted by as much as 90 per cent, coupled with the fact that stamp duty has fallen from the previously outlandish rates of nine per cent to one per cent, it may still appeal to nursing home operators,’ said Mr Cleary.

There is now intense interest in the house, but most buyers are looking for a home rather than a development site, he said.

A survey at the beginning of the year 
which looks at the performance of the world's mainstream housing markets
placed Ireland firmly at the bottom.

While
at the end of last month, new data from the Central Statistics Office 
revealed that residential property prices fell by almost 18 per cent in 
the year to 
February.

At the end of last year, The Irish Taoiseach revealed tough new austerity measures 
including hiking VAT to 23 per cent in a bid to save €3.8billion.

Abandoned: The property crash has resulted in more than 1,600 ghost estates across Ireland, including the Glenall development in Borris-in-Ossory, Co. Laois

Enda Kenny pledged to get Ireland's budget deficit under an EU limit
of 3 per cent of GDP by 2015 and said this budget would be the toughest
in a four-year run of belt-tightening.

The proposals included rises in indirect taxes - 
including a 2 per cent hike in VAT, increases in excise duty, cuts in 
social welfare and reduced child benefit.

It also featured an increase in VAT, as well as a new property tax, taxes on luxury items and raising the pension age.

The property crash has also resulted in more than 1,600 ghost estates, with houses completely abandoned, across Ireland, including the Glenall development in Borris-in-Ossory, Co. Laois.

Meanwhile Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Ireland has kick-started the Cork property market, real estate agents claim.

Skibbereen-based Charles McCarthy estate agents said UK inquiries are up by 40 per cent. ‘We have seen interest from the UK pick up hugely over the last 12 months, which has been in part due to a return of value to the market and a strong sterling,’ they said.
