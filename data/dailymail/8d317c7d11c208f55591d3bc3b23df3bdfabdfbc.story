A grieving mother has called for cot bumpers to be banned from British shops after her baby son died after becoming entangled in one.

Lisa Gee, 26, said she found her baby Preston dead with the ties caught around his neck when she went into his room in Loughborough, Leicestershire.

The mother-of-two and her partner Cuchulain Brian, 23, believe it was the bumper she bought on eBay that strangled her young son.

Bumper tragedy: Lisa Gee, 26, and her partner Cuchulain Brian, 23, found their son dead in this cot with the cot bumper tie tangled up around his neck

It had been tied securely to the cot in three places - but one of the knots had come undone.

The couple have launched an online petition in an effort to get the law changed and avoid a repeat of the tragedy.

Cot bumpers have been banned in Chicago and Maryland, in the US, after they were linked to the deaths of 27 children across the US over a 20-year period up until 2005.

In Britain, there is no formal advice on whether they should be used or not - despite differences in medical opinion.

Charities said parents should keep cots clutter-free to reduce the risk of cot death and warned against using bumpers for babies under one-year old.

The Lullaby Trust, the safer sleep baby charity, said they do not recommend using them at all as they are not necessary.

Cuchulain said: 'When I went 
into the nursery and saw Preston laying their lifeless with the material
 from the cot bumper round his neck, my heart just dropped.

'I didn't know what to do. It was like my world had come crashing down before me.'

Lisa said: 'Cuc called me into the nursery but I knew something was wrong from the tone in his voice.

Family grief: Preston's mother said his two siblings have struggled to cope with losing their young brother

'When
 I walked in, I looked over to the cot and saw Preston just lying there,
 motionless, entangled in the bumper I just turned to Cuc and broke down
 in his arms.

'Preston was the happiest, bubbliest little baby that you could ever meet and he was no trouble at all.

'He would often go all night without making a peep so we had no reason to believe anything was wrong.'

An inquest is expected to be held into Preston's death on September 11 by the Loughborough coroner. The results of a post-mortem examination carried out to establish the cause of death are not yet known.

Lisa said the cot bumper came with a 
small age warning that was written on the wash label, which she said was
 not clearly visible to her.

'The
 warning for the plastic packaging was markedly more visible than the 
age suitability information on the product,' she added.

'I
 think there is a need for much clearer safety guidelines on all baby 
products as people like me, just use such products because its the done 
thing.

'Risk': The parents of Preston Brian have called for all cot bumpers to be banned in Britain after their son died after getting his neck caught. Bumpers are tied to the railings to stop babies banging their head or getting their limbs caught in the railings (file photo - this is not the bumper involved)

Grief: Lisa and her partner Cuchulain have launched a campaign to get cot bumpers banned in Britain

'All my friends used 
cot bumpers until recently with their children, my mum used them with me
 and my other siblings, there was no question about using a cot bumper.

Lisa added that her other two children have struggled to understand the death of their younger brother.

Bumpers are fabric linings fitted to the edge of cots to stop babies from banging their heads or getting their limbs caught in the bars.

They are often attached to the bars using Velcro or are tied to them.

Parents have been urged not to use them for safety reasons to reduce the risk of cot death.

However, there is no official advice in Britain against using them.

The American Academy of Paediatrics said in 2011 that children can be killed by cot bumpers - and urged parents to remove them.

‘We weighed the pros and cons and the evidence, and felt that the safest thing would be to keep bumpers out of the crib altogether,’ said Dr Fern Hauck, a spokesman for the Academy and professor of family medicine at the University of Virginia.

'My other children Tamari 
and Dylan have taken the loss of Preston really badly,' she said. 'Preston and 
Tamari were very similar ages and they loved playing together and she 
really misses him and asks where he is all the time.

'Dylan,
 being older, I think understands a lot more what has happened and he 
knows that his little brother isn't coming back and it's really affected
 him emotionally.

'He's been receiving counselling to try and help him come to terms with everything.'

Lisa has also set up a Facebook page called Justice for Preston - but she was distraught when she received abuse about the death of her child.

People wrote that cot bumpers should not be used for children aged under one.

'These comments are 
so hurtful and the point we as a family are trying to make is that these
 age restrictions aren't clear enough on the products out there,' she added.

'Presumably,
 like me, many other parents use these products to protect their 
children. Naturally, if you buy something for that purpose, you don't 
question the fact that it may actually be putting your children at 
harm.'

Lisa's mother and Preston's grandmother Samantha Gee, 43, said that when she brought her children up a cot bumper was an essential item.

'Just like I bought a sun umbrella for the buggy, or a bottle steriliser
 to protect my children from germs - a cot bumper was one of the 
essential items I bought to keep my children safe.

'What
 we have learnt the hard way is that cot bumpers aren't safe, but people
 need advising not to use these potentially very dangerous cot bumpers.'

Rosie Dodds, a senior policy adviser with the NCT charity who assist new parents, said that cot bumpers should not be used for babies who are aged under one year.

She said: 'It is recommended that the inside of a baby’s cot should be as clutter-free as possible.

'Pillows, duvets and cot bumpers aren’t safe for babies younger than one year due to the risk of suffocation.

'Duvets and bumpers can also make the baby too hot and bumpers can be used to climb on when babies become more mobile.'

Jenny Ward, Head of Support and Development of The Lullaby Trust, the safer baby sleep charity, said: 'There is no evidence associated with cot bumpers and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) but they do pose an accident risk.

'We don’t recommend them or believe they are necessary. Our safer sleep advice, to reduce the risk of SIDS, recommends that a baby should sleep in a cot or moses basket with no extra bedding or soft toys.

'The death of a child is tragic and we extend our deepest sympathies to the family of Preston Brian.

'We offer a bereavement support service to any family affected by the death of a baby or toddler. Families can call 0808 802 6868.'
