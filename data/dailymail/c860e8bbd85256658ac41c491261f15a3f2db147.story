With his tartan trews, piercing blue eyes and neatly trimmed moustache, this dashing young war hero was a young girl’s dream.

And that young girl just happened to be the 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth.

Infantry officer Roddy Macleod was the ‘devastatingly attractive’ chap who set the future Queen’s heart a-flutter back in 1945.

He is pictured escorting her from a theatre shortly after the Second World War and dancing the Dashing White Sergeant with Elizabeth and her sister Princess Margaret.

The Daily Mail tracked down the previously unseen photographs after a letter written by the Queen in November 1945 came to light last week, revealing that she had something of a crush on Macleod.

In girlishly gossipy prose, the young unmarried Elizabeth wrote to her cousin how she and Margaret had met ‘a devastatingly attractive young giant (with fair hair and blue eyes of course) from Skye called Roddy Macleod! He caused my Margaret’s heart to flutter a bit, I think (mine too, a bit) and he was great fun!’

Macleod’s fascinating story can now be told after his sons, Jamie and Simon Robertson-Macleod, recognised the description of their father, who died in 1989 aged 69, in the Queen’s letter, which was up for sale as part of a collection of royal memorabilia.

Simon has since bought the royal letter and will keep it as a treasured family heirloom. In 1945, when he was 26, 6ft 4in Eton-educated Army captain Roderick Cameron Robertson-Macleod had just spent nearly five years as a Nazi prisoner of war.

Gushing: This letter written by the Queen came to light last week which includes the passage about Roddy Macleod

A Cameron Highlander, he was captured in June 1940 at St Valery-en-Caux in northern France.

He and his comrades were made to march all the way to Poland, and spent the rest of the war in camps across Poland and Germany.

On return to Britain, he was assigned to the Royal Guard at Balmoral.

As well as guarding the vivacious young princesses, he taught them Highland dancing and there is no doubt he caught the eye of both the future Queen – who two years later would marry Prince Philip – and her younger sister.

After his royal posting, Macleod studied zoology at Cambridge and in 1950 married Daphne, and they had two sons. Aged 93, Daphne now lives in a care home.

Macleod earned the Distinguished Service Order for ‘magnificent leadership’ in the Korean War and retired from the Army at 45 as a Lieutenant Colonel.

He became commandant of the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan Castle in Fife – where  Princess Margaret paid a royal visit in 1966.

‘The authorities disapproved of him inviting her directly, rather than approaching her through protocol, but of course he did know her,’ said his son Jamie, 62, who lives in Sussex.

‘Princess Margaret kept in touch with my father, and wrote him a nice letter when he was ill with throat and lung cancer.

‘My father was very good looking, very relaxed, calm under pressure and possessed of a lovely warm and charming character.’

Jamie Robertson-Macleod’s own career has been peppered with royal links. After leaving the Army at 30, he was aide-de-camp to Princess Grace of Monaco.

He went on to become chief executive of adventure specialists Raleigh International and was in charge of Prince William’s gap-year trip to Chile in 2000.

He joked: ‘We never looked back until this letter came to light.

‘But I could have been the Prince of Wales, Jack [his son] would have been the Duke of Cambridge and we would have been able to live in Buckingham Palace and hand out honours to all our friends.’

Wedding day: Macleod wand Daphne when they tied the knot in 1950. They had two sons

The letter, signed using her pet name
‘Lilibet’, was sent by Elizabeth to her cousin Diana Bowes-Lyon. Years 
later it ended up in the hands of a private collector, who sold it to 
royal manuscripts expert Sophie Dupre, a regular on the Antiques 
Roadshow.

Jamie’s brother Simon, 59, an executive at the Fuller’s brewery in London, paid £5,970 to acquire it.

‘Apparently there was another buyer interested, but when he heard we were the sons, he very gallantly withdrew,’ Simon said.

‘To
have the letter means so much to us, and it makes us very proud of my 
father. As my eldest son said, he was clearly a bit of a cool dude in 
his day.’
