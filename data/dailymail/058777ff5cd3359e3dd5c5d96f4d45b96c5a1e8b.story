Ilkay Gundogan returned to action for Borussia Dortmund's, but couldn't prevent his side from slipping to a 2-1 defeat at Cologne.

It was the midfielder 's first appearance for 17 months following a back injury but goals from Kevin Vogt and Simon Zoller either side of a Ciro Immobile equaliser helped pile on a fifth defeat in eight league matches for Jurgen Klopp's side.

Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller gifted their opponents the winner with a failed clearance in the 74th minute that allowed  Zoller to score, after the visitors had equalised through Immobile early in the second half at the RheinEnergieStadion.

Dortmund, who travel to Galatasaray in the Champions League next week, drop to 14th on seven points after their third consecutive defeat. They are now just three points above bottom club Bremen.

The win for Cologne takes them above Dortmund in the table and up to tenth.

Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen spectacularly imploded, giving up a 3-0 half-time lead to draw 3-3 against troubled VfB Stuttgart.

Leverkusen looked set for an easy afternoon after two goals from Son Heung-min and another one from Germany international Karim Bellarabi gave them a comfortable lead.

Yet they inexplicably lost focus after the break with Timo Werner, Florian Klein and Martin Harnik scoring at 10-minute intervals for the hosts with Leverkusen's defence in tatters.

Wolfsburg kept up their good form to climb to fourth on 14 points with a 2-1 win at Freiburg.
