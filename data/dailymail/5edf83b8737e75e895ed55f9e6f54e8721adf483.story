Life might begin at 40 - but it seems those aged over 45 are the ones who really enjoy themselves.

According to a new survey, those in the middle-aged category are the happiest people in Britain.

In a survey of more than 2,000 adults, those over 45 - dubbed by researchers as the mid-life risers - came out on top, in part due to strong relationships with family and friends.

Researchers from dating service Love Begins At found that 60 per cent of those in that age range felt content - and 83 per cent said they had strong relationships with family and friends.

The study asked adults to rate how they felt across different areas, based on the five elements for happiness devised by pyschiatrist Carl Jung.

And it found that those who have lived for more than four decades were the happiest generation.

Researchers
 at Love Begins At and YouGov have now dubbed this age group as the 'mid-life risers' 
because they say it is the 'new aspiration generation'.

The categories on which the adults were questioned included good physical and mental health, good personal and intimate relationships and good standard of living and satisfactory work.

They were also asked about their appreciation of art, nature and world events, as well as the ability to cope with the ups and down of life.

Those aged over 45 came out top in three of the five categories, with 83 per cent feeling they had a strong network of friends and family.

This was compared to 73 per cent of those in the 25-44 age group.

Knowledge, education and understanding of world news and issues was also felt more strongly by those in the older category.

Just over 75 per cent said they felt content with their knowledge, compared with 72 per cent of those aged between 25 - 44.

A separate study conducted with YouGov also showed 43 per cent of men aged over 55 felt their life had got better since turning 45.

Samantha 
Bedford, from Love Begins At, said: 'It’s great to look forward to 
life ahead with excitement – with the confidence and wherewithal to make
 the most of the opportunities available.

'These mid-life risers are not about fading into grey. It’s about moving into a
 new stage of life, post-children and preparing to try something new. These over 45s are often moving into a new stage of their romantic life too.

'Independent,
 confident and content looking, they’re no longer looking for the mother
 or father of their children but for a partner to enjoy life with.'
