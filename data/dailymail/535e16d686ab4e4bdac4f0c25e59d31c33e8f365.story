Cathy hopes to raise funds for her new lingerie company by pawning her collection of designer goods

Most people considering starting a business would begin by asking their bank for a loan.

But former model Cathy Brooks is taking a novel approach to raising funds for her new lingerie company, by pawning her collection of designer goods.

Not a materialistic person, Miss Brooks, 47, from Lymington, Hampshire, had barely used the Chanel and Hermes handbags she amassed during her days as a model alongside Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss.

And for 16 years they had been gathering dust in her father’s attic.

But when mother-of-two Miss Brooks decided to launch Perfectpetalunderwear.com, she remembered an ex-boyfriend called James Constantinou, and the pawn broker’s shop he runs in Surrey.

And now she is hoping to make around £50,000 by selling her Chanel and Hermes bags, as well as several diamond rings, a bracelet and a necklace.

Tonight, the former model will appear on Channel 4 documentary Posh Pawn to find out how much her collection is worth to Mr Constantinou.

It is without doubt an unusual approach to raising money. Although perhaps not to Mr Constantinou, who deals with everyone from bankers flogging vintage Champagne, to people like Miss Brooks chasing entrepreneurial dreams.

And after coming up with Perfect Petal over a bottle of wine with her sister and friend, Miss Brooks decided to set about pawning the designer items she had thought would never see the light of day again.

Miss Brooks said: ‘We’d been toying with the idea for a couple of years. And my sister said “but Cath we’re going to have to go to the bank” and I’m like “banks, God, re-mortgaging houses. No.” I’d seen James on TV shows last year and I thought well let’s give it a go.’

Some of the items were gifts from the mother of two’s ex-husband – a violent drug dealer who wooed Miss Brooks while on the run from police. 

Others she acquired during her modelling days, on the catwalk and fronting campaigns and catalogues for the likes of Selfridges, Bruce Oldfield and Bacardi.

And while one, a Hermes handbag she bought herself, was difficult to let go of, most were barely ever used by Miss Brooks.

For 16 years Cathy appeared on the catwalk and in campaigns such as the one pictured for Selfridges, rubbing shoulders with the world¿s top models

And she 
said: ‘I’ve had the Chanel handbags, the Hermes handbag, some beautiful 
jewellery. I’ve still got my Rolex watch, lots of designer clothes – 
Bruce Oldfield, Chanel dresses, I love Chanel.

‘But
 as beautiful as they were I couldn’t remember ever even using them. 
Some of them were given to me but I bought one of the bags, a Hermes 
one. And they hadn’t been used for 12 years.’

She added: ‘I’m not a very materialistic person. When I was a model I had some really nice clothing and handbags and I did sometimes use them but not a lot. I’m happier in jeans and a t-shirt.’

Miss Brooks’ modelling career began as a 14 year old, when celebrity photographer David Steen asked her to appear in a shoot he was doing with The Jam rocker Paul Weller.

And for the next 16 years she appeared on the catwalk and in campaigns, rubbing shoulders with the world’s top models, before being diagnosed Cushing’s Syndrome, a rare but at times debilitating disease.

The disease, which can be brought on by stress, saw the naturally slender model balloon from nine stone to 16, develop facial hair and lose most of the hair on her head.

She also developed a hunch in her neck, which caused her to shrink two inches, and she became a recluse in her own home after giving up on her career and refusing to be seen by any of her friends.

But looking back Miss Brooks is not bitter about her illness, instead believing it has shaped the person she is today.

Recalling her days on the catwalk, as she considers returning as a mature model, Miss Brooks said: ‘I’ve had a great life with it. I’ve worked with Naomi [Campbell] and Kate [Moss] and Yasmin Le Bon and they’re very professional. 

The former model will appear on Channel 4 documentary Posh Pawn as she waits to see how much her collection is worth to Mr Constantinou

‘They’ll smile, say hello, there’s no them and us, I never felt that at all. At the end of the day I was really proud that I was in their presence. There was this one show we did and I just remember seeing Kate and Naomi backstage hugging each other and thinking "God, I wish I had a camera".

'They were in their little world those two and I remember thinking "wow, they are so big".’

Miss Brooks will appear in tonight’s episode of Posh Pawn, which airs on Channel 4 at 8pm.

The programme will see her offering three handbags – one Hermes and two Chanel – two pairs of diamond earrings, one diamond bracelet and three rings to Mr Constantinou.

And it will reveal whether or not she is made a cash offer for the items.
