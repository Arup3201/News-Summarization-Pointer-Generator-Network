Charged: Matthew C. Graziotti, 42, pictured, distributed 141 pictures and six videos that depicted sexual abuse and exploitation of children to an undercover FBI agent, according to a Department of Justice statement

An elementary school teacher in Orlando, Florida, has been charged with producing and distributing child pornography.

Matthew C. Graziotti, 42, who worked at Warner Christian Academy, distributed 141 pictures and six videos that depicted sexual abuse and exploitation of children to an undercover FBI agent, according to a Department of Justice statement.

On Monday, police executed a search warrant and found thousands of images of child porn on Graziotti's computer, including one where he is molesting a prepubescent boy.

Agents later found the camera that was used to take that photograph.

Graziotti teaches at the elementary school, is the director of the school's summer day camp program and he previoulsy worked at a church in Edgewater as a youth pastor, the DOJ said.

Warner Christian Academy Superintendent Mark Tress said he was stunned by the news.

'Shock, absolutely shocked. We had not received any kind of report or concern,' he told Click Orlando.

'We are take this seriously, real seriously, and I feel badly that it's happened. But again, we didn't have any idea, any inclination at all.'

Neighbors looking on as agents raided Graziotti's Edgewater home were also in disbelief.

'It shocked the hell out of me when I heard it, it really did,' said neighbor Charles Hoff.

Graziotti has been charged with production, distribution, receipt and possession of child pornography.

He faces a mandatory minimum penalty of 15 years, up to 30 years federal prison for the production charge and a mandatory minimum of five years and up to 20 years imprisonment for each count for the receipt and distribution of the pornography.

Graziotti has been placed on unpaid administrative leave effective immediately and investigators are appealing for any potential victims.
