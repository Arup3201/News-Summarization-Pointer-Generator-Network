A couple have been arrested for violently beating their four adopted children and forcing them to perform sex acts in a disturbing catalogue of abuse which police say amounts to torture.

Aubrey Thomas, 58, and his wife Laura, 47, have been accused of forcing the children to throw up and eat their own vomit, beating them with a large paddle called 'Mr Awesome' and than making them soak in a bath of ice to reduce swelling from the abuse.

Investigators described the family's Oklahoma home, where the two girls and two boys now aged between 13 and 15 lived, as a 'house of horrors'.

The children said they were sexually abused, claiming they were
 forced to eat gum off Aubrey Thomas' penis and made to perform oral 
sex on their adoptive siblings in exchange for food.

The Thomas' also allegedly forced them to put urine soaked underwear in their mouths if they wet the bed 
and forced them to eat horse manure for not cleaning a horse pen, reports News9.com.

The couple is facing a series of child abuse charges.

The couple, who lived in Rogers County, became foster parents in 2001 and took in six children.

In 2003, the Oklahoma Department of Human Services removed two of the children from their home after finding evidence of abuse, Osage County Undersheriff Lou Ann Brown told Tulsa World.

But the couple were able to keep the other four children and moved to Osage County west of Sperry in 2006.

In October, the Osage County Sheriff's Office was called in to investigate after one of the girls, who had been put into a psychiatric facility, revealed the allegations to a counselor, reports the Tulsa World.  

Investigators say the home schooled children, who were all found to be malnourished, were coached not to say anything about the alleged abuse.

Osage County sheriff's investigator Justin Kling's reports says the girls, particularly, were singled out for 'heinous abuse', reports the Tulsa World. 

Kling was able to track down a biological daughter of the Thomas' who had moved away in 2008. She echoed the stories of abuse.

'It's probably one of the worst cases that I know of that's happened 
around here in a long time,' Brown told News9.com.

'To treat a child like that is beyond my imagination.'

The four children are now in protective custody.

The DHS released a statement to News9.com saying: 'We are rigorously reviewing this case to find any mistakes made by our agency or others during the years of involvement with this family.

'This is absolutely intolerable. It is our mission to protect children and we will take whatever corrective action is needed to ensure this does not happen in the future.'
