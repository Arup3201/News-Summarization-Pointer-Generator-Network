Hull owner Assem Allam has repeated his threat to sell the club if the FA fails to ratify his bid to change their name.

Confusion reigns over the current status of Allam's application after an arbitration tribunal found the original FA Council decision to reject his application could not stand.

Allam told the Hull Daily Mail: 'The club is up for sale as I've said before. There is no change. If I can change the club's name to Hull Tigers then I will stay and develop the club further and further. I have shown it would be a success.

Hull supporters have publicly stated their opposition to the name change and don't want the 'City' dropped

'If it is not Hull Tigers then the club will be sold. What is the problem with that? I could have sold the club already, but I want it to go to a good home.'

Allam appears to have until April 1 to submit a new bid to change the club's name in time for next season, although he insists a new application is not necessary.

Allam added: 'The tribunal states, in this case the FA saying no to Tigers, that the decision should be set aside. That means nothing has happened.

'The application has not been answered. The tribunal says our appeal was successful. That decision to set it aside was unanimous.'

On the pitch, Hull are fighting a relegation battle while the boardroom battles centre around the club's name
