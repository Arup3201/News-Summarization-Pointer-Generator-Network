Chelsea must be wary of Roberto Mancini's Galatasaray on Tuesday evening. Here, Sportsmail runs the rule over the Turkish giants and identifies three key men who can dent the Blues' hopes of progressing to the quarter-finals.

THE OLD FRIEND

Didier Drogba will make an emotional return to Stamford Bridge on Tuesday but could still do his old employers some damage.

He had a quiet night in the first leg in Istanbul where John Terry marshalled him well, but he has scored twice for Galatasaray since that meeting and will want to add to his tally on a ground where he found the net 89 times for Chelsea.

Returning hero: Didier Drogba will be back at Stamford Bridge and is certain to get a warm reception

No love lost: Drogba says it will be difficult to play against Chelsea but will do his utmost to win the game

History boy: Drogba was instrumental in Chelsea's Champions League win over Bayern Munich in 2012

1-1 after the first leg

Kick-off: 7.45pm, Stamford Bridge

TV & Radio: LIVE on ITV1 from 7.30pm and BBC Radio 5 Live and talkSPORT

Referee: Felix Brych (Germany)

CORAL BOOT ROOM BET: Didier Drogba to score — 10-3

THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY

Wesley Sneijder was linked with a move to Chelsea last summer but the Dutchman opted to go to Turkey instead where he is now one of Galatasaray’s most creative players. In the first leg his corner led to his team’s equaliser and he created more chances than any other player on the pitch.

He also knows what it takes to win at Stamford Bridge — in his  only appearance at the ground he helped Inter Milan to a 1-0 win in 2010. 

His manager that night? Jose Mourinho.

The and now: Wesley Sneijder was a key player in Mourinho's Treble-winning Inter Milan side

Maestro: Sneijder's eye for a pass makes him a dangerous opponent in front of the Blues' defence

Three to fear: Drogba (right), Sneijder and Felipe Melo pose for the cameras earlier this season

Tribute: Felipe Melo named his son after Gary Lineker, to the surprise of the former England star

THE GARY LINEKER FAN

Felipe Melo might play in midfield but he always has one eye up front, so much so he named his son after Gary Lineker. 

Melo explained in 2010: ‘I gave that name [Lineker] to my son because I find it very beautiful.’ Though flattered, Lineker said: ‘Surely with the array of talent within the Brazilian team, he could have named him after someone other than a goal hanger like me!’

Melo has only scored twice all season, but he made more passes in the Chelsea half than any other player in the first leg.

CHELSEA’S CENTENARY MAN

If he plays tonight, Petr Cech will be making his 100th appearance in the Champions League, with 88 of those coming for Chelsea and the other 12 for Sparta Prague.

Galatasaray will do well to get past the Czech goalkeeper  — he has conceded just 10 goals at Stamford Bridge this season and only one at home in 2014.

Interesting method: Petr Cech could make his 100th appearance in the Champions League on Tuesday

Curious: Cech was put through his paces using a tennis racquet and tennis balls at Cobham

Veteran: Cech concedes a penalty from then Barcelona playmaker Ronaldinho back in 2005

Galatasaray are in good form having lost just one of their last 23 matches. But they have only won four out of 19 away games all season.

The Turks also have a miserable record in England. In eight matches they have won just once, drawing three and losing five.
