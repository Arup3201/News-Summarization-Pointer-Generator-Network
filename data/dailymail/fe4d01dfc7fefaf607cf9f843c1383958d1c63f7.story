FBI Director James Comey says he's confident that North Korea was behind the cyberattack on Sony.

Comey said Wednesday that threats made against Sony were traced to IP addresses used exclusively by the North Koreans, at a cybersecurity conference at New York's Fordham University.

Comey also said there was evidence that North Korea had sought to use proxy servers to conceal the Sony hack but they sometimes 'got sloppy' and didn't use the servers - and that they would strike again. 

These claims just raise more questions however for one cyber expert, Marc Rogers.

Revelation: James Comey (file photo above) said Wednesday that he is ceratin North Korea is behind the Sony hack

Motivation: It is believed by the FBI that the hack begun over North Korea's disapproval of the Sony film The Interview (above)

'The Guardians of Peace would send emails threatening Sony employees and post online various statements explaining their work. In nearly every case they would use proxy servers in sending those emails and posting those statements,' said Comey.

'But several times they got sloppy. Several times, either because they forgot or they had a technical problem, they connected directly and we could see it.' 

He also added; 'We could see that the IP addresses they used ... were IPs that were exclusively used by the North Koreans. It was a mistake by them. It was a very clear indication of who was doing this. They would shut it off very quickly once they realized the mistake, but not before we saw them and knew where it was coming from.' 

Working as both the director of security operations for DEF CON, the world’s largest hacker conference, and the principal security researcher for global CDN and DNS provider Cloudflare, Rogers may be one of the foremost experts when it comes to hacking. 

'It is certainly interesting stuff and adds a bit more color to the attack, but nothing he said conclusively ties it to the North Koreans,' said Rogers.

'For example when he says IP addresses exclusively used by North Korea, what does he actually mean?' he asks.

'When he says emails and messages, what messages and how does he know they weren't fake or bounced off of other servers to hide their origin?'

He then went on to say, 'How do we even know the emails that look like a slip-up were even sent by the attackers? Anyone could have sent them pretending to be Guardians of Peace.' 

Rogers had previously voiced his problems with the FBI's claims against North Korea back in December in a piece her wrote for The Daily Beast.

The first FBI claim that Rogers tore down also happened to be one the strongest that the FBI had, saying in their statement; 'The malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed.'

There were two problems with this according to Rogers, and both had to do with the bureau basing their findings on assumptions as opposed to fact.

First, while a similar malware may have been used in a previous cyber attack that North Korea has been linked to, that does not serve as definitive proof that this attack was carried out by North Korea.

Rogers then further chipped away at their statement, pointing out that he and many security experts do not believe North Korea was involved in those previous incidents, whose coding the FBI is referencing to tie the attacks together.

What's more, the coding for one of the two malwares, Shamoon, was leaked according to Rogers, and would not be difficult for any hacker to find.

He then took aim at the FBI conclusion that since the IP addresses used in the attack are addresses used by North Korea in previous attacks, they must be responsible.

According to Rogers, the reasoning is flawed as these addresses are used by everyone from major hackers to even small time Internet criminals to avoid detection, meaning these addresses could tie virtually anyone in the hacking community, or even someone using stolen credit cards to shop online and avoid detection, to the attack.

Then, there is the fact that the demand by the hacking group, who call themselves the Guardians of Peace, that the The Interview not be released was not announced until weeks into the hack, and only after some members of the media had begun to perpetuate the now widely accepted story that the goal of the hack was to make sure The Interview would never be distributed by Sony.

Rogers pointed all this out again on Wednesday after seeing the new FBI claims, saying; 'We have already seen the FBI send out a flash alert to media organizations based on one spoof.'
