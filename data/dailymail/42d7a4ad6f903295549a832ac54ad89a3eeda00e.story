Luis Suarez might have thought he was leaving behind the cold weather when he left England for the warmer climes of sunny Spain last summer.

But the Barcelona striker didn't seem to mind the Arctic conditions as he took his family out for a day in the snow on Wednesday.

The former Liverpool hitman may not have been able to replicate the ice-cool finishing that won him the PFA Player of the Year last season as he netted 31 league goals but Suarez looks a dab hand when it comes to building a snowman.

The Uruguay international took to Instagram to upload snaps with his wife and two children as they frolicked in the snow and even enjoyed a spot of sledging.

'Thank you my loves for making me spend this wonderful day with you. I love you with all my heart,' Suarez wrote on the social networking site.

Suarez's Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi has also been enjoying the snow this week, and he too shared a picture with his girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo and their young son.

Suarez and Messi were enjoying a rare midweek off before they return to action when Barcelona take on Athletic Bilbao in La Liga on Sunday.

Rivals Real Madrid beat Sevilla 2-1 on Wednesday night to open up a four-point lead over the Catalan club at the top of the table.

Despite coming in for criticism in recent weeks, Luis Enrique's side are currently on an eight-game wining streak in all competitions as they try to keep pace with the Champions League winners.
