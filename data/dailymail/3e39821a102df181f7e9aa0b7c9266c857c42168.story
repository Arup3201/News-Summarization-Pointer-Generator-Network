Georgia Sigourney, 12, has been left with horrific scars after her face was brutally mauled by a friend's Siberian Husky

A 12-year-old girl has been left with horrific scars and narrowly avoided being blinded after her face was brutally mauled by a friend's new Siberian Husky.

Georgia Sigourney was lying on the floor at her friend's house watching X Factor when she accidentally nudged the dog, causing it to tear the flesh around her mouth and cheeks.

The schoolgirl ran screaming in tears with blood pouring down her face from the house in Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, after the animal attacked.

Her father Chris, 34, said: 'It's horrendous, I was absolutely devastated. She's very upset and scared of dogs now. She's really nervous.

'It's just started to sink in. She's a pretty girl and she's obviously worried how she's going to look.

'If it was just a bit lower down it could have killed her or if it was a bit higher up she could have been blinded.

'It is horrible to say but she is lucky to have it where it is. She really is lucky to be alive when you think about it.' 

He said that Georgia was sitting on the floor with the dog asleep behind her.

She then stood up and nudged the dog, which suddenly flipped and clamped its jaw down on her face. 

Mr Sigourney said: 'She screamed and screamed. Her friend just locked herself in the bathroom so she was alone with the dog.' 

Georgia was rushed to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, where she was put on a drip and given 31 external stitches and 20 internally.

She is finding it difficult to eat because of the pain of opening her mouth and has to drink through a straw.

She was sat on the floor at her friend's home when she accidentally nudged the dog, causing it to lunge at her face and tear the flesh around her mouth and cheeks

This is believed to be the dog that attacked Georgia. A member of her friend's family posted this picture of the Siberian Husky, saying: 'We got a new dog today, love her'

'It's ruined her life. This is going to haunt her for the rest of her life even if she was really brave at the time,' said Mr Sigourney.

'I want to say thank you to the doctors because they pretty much pieced her face back together.

Police have now seized the dog, which apparently belonged to a friend of the family who lived at the house where the attack happened.

Mr Sigourney said his daughter's friend had posted on Facebook that day saying 'this is our new dog Dakota'.

'But now they are claiming it's not their dog and have given it to police to destroy,' he added.

'They only live two minutes down the street. My daughter said she and her friend had been left alone in the house for two hours.'

Georgia's father Chris (left) said his daughter, pictured with her brother Callum, is lucky to be alive

'We have two dogs of our own and Georgia knows how to behave around animals. She's never been involved in an incident before.

'We are just leaving the police to deal with it. I just want to warn other people to be careful. Do not leave your dogs alone with children because they can get hurt.'

A spokeswoman for Cambridgeshire Police said: 'The dog has been seized by police.

'We are awaiting advice from the dangerous dogs officer as to what should happen to it.'

The family who owned the dog refused to comment on the incident.
