A council is putting the final touches to next week’s Bonfire Night celebrations - without a bonfire.

Portsmouth City Council's £20,000 fireworks display will still go ahead - but it cannot afford to have a traditional pyre with a Guy Fawkes effigy on top, because ensuring the health and safety of the public would be too expensive.

Officials at the local authority in Hampshire claimed a bonfire at the King George V playing fields in the Cosham area of the city next Wednesday would cost £4,600 - which they cannot afford.

They said the cost would involve them having to ‘secure’ the area around the bonfire, buy ‘clean’ wood which has no harmful chemicals on it, and re-seed the grass afterwards.

Cosham ward councillor Aiden Gray, of the Labour party, said: ‘It is disappointing that the bonfire will be missing from such a popular family event. It is a terrible shame to see the bonfire cut.

‘I know the council has to make cuts but it is such an important event for a lot of people in the city. I am disappointed the decision is not being looked into more.’

He said other organisations such as the local Rotary Club could have been called upon to help fund the event, and then the proceeds from the night given to a charity.

Mr Gray added: ‘It is such a wonderful event that I think the budget for it needed to be balanced better. They could have had fewer or cheaper fireworks, so they could still have the bonfire.

Bonfire Night in Peterlee, County Durham, was cancelled by councillors in May, with the  leader saying this was down to health and safety, and congestion caused by heavy traffic.

But other councillors suggested it was due to cost-cutting, with the event expected to have come in with a bill of up to £7,000.

And Bonfire Night celebrations last October in Littlehampton, West Sussex, were cancelled due to dangerous weather conditions.

The Met Office had warned of winds peaking at 80mph at the time, with the local bonfire society saying they had calling off the event in the interests of public safety.

Organisers later said they faced a ‘disgraceful’ torrent of abuse for cancelling the display.

In 2011, a Bonfire Night in Birmingham was called off because it was too expensive to put on - but they still had a firework display. The eventual bill for the event was £30,000 rather than the forecast £60,000 with the bonfire.

And earlier this month the Bonfire Night in Uplawmoor, East Renfrewshire, was cancelled due to 'time required to gain all appropriate approvals from relevant authorities'.

‘But I don’t think much was said about it when the decision was made. The council could have called on the community to help. They should have been able to empower the community to take it on.'

Conservative councillors - who blame the previous Liberal Democrat administration - say scrapping the bonfire will save £4,600 and they hope to find sponsors to reinstate it next year.

A Tory minority has been running the council since elections in May. 

Lib Dem councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, former leader of the council, said: ‘It was a cross-party decision to cut the bonfire.

‘If some councillors wanted to get community groups involved, they have had a whole year to do it. The amount of money government has cut from council budgets over the years has been very great and we had to try to find ways of saving money to balance the books.’

Current council leader Donna Jones said: ‘When economic times are tough it’s easy to overlook events like this, but the feel-good factor they create is not to be under-estimated.

'We’d consider approaching local businesses for sponsorship and support for the bonfire next year.’

The free-to-watch firework event, which will cost about £19,600, will be funded by the council, along with donations of £1,120 from transport company Stagecoach and local travel campaign My Journey. 

A Portsmouth City Council spokesman told MailOnline: 'It's not about health and safety. This is a really popular event we put on every year - and the bonfire was the most expensive part.'
