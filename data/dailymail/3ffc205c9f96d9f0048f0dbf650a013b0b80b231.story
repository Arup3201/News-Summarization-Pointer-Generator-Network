The once dignified faces of famous historical figures have been transformed by a graphic artist, who replaced them with those of infants. 

The series, called 'The True Faces of History's Kings', was created by Swedish advertising photographer Emil Nystrom.

The 26-year-old enlisted the help of his daughters Hilma and Signhild and the work of several Old Masters.

Confused: Graphic artist Emil Nystrom used Photoshop to superimpose his daughters' faces onto famous figures in paintings by Old Masters. Pictured, baby Napoleon Bonaparte from a painting by Joseph Chabord

Royal: Michael Dahl's portrait of Queen Anne of Great Britain has been transformed after Mr Nystrom planted a picture of his daughter over the monarch's face

Using photographs of his young children, Mr Nystrom placed their faces over 18th and 19th century figures, including Napoleon Bonaparte, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II of the Habsburg empire, and British naval officer, Edward Pellew 1st Viscount Exmouth. 

Mr Nystrom, who is from Umea in Sweden, said: 'This is not the way the kings, queens and admirals saw themselves, but rather the way we see them a few hundred years later.

'I imagine all these leaders being childish and fighting over things that really weren't there to fight over, like how children would behave.

'The images are created by using old paintings by Old Masters, taking new photographs of infants in the same poses and using the same light as in the old paintings.

Screaming: This Francis Cotes painting of Admiral Harry Paulet is much more humorous after Mr Nystrom's handiwork

Yawn: A grey-haired baby Edward Pellew, the 1st Viscount Exmouth, a British naval officer,  from a painting by James Northcote

Happy: The artist's smiling daughter has her face pasted over King Gustav III of Sweden in this painting by Alexander Roslin

'To create the final result, I took the babies and put their faces on top of these paintings in Photoshop.' 

The original paintings were created by artists such as James Northcote, Francis Cotes and Charles Wellington Furse.

Mr Nystrom added: 'With planning, finding the right painting, setting up the lighting and doing the Photoshop work, it takes about one day per image.

'People tend to find the set of photographs humorous.

'It's something different that you don't see every day so the first reaction is usually a laugh.

'From what I can remember I started to get really interested photography when I was about 14 years old.

'I put the photos into Photoshop and created all kinds of weird images, and it's carried on from there.'

Disgusted: The dignified portrait of Lord Charles Beresford, a British admiral and Member of Parliament, now has a hilariously sour expression

Childish: Joseph II, the Holy Roman Emperor of the Habsburg empire, pulls a funny face in this painting by an unknown artist

Adorable: Baby William Waldegrave, 1st Baron Radstock, who was an admiral in the Royal Navy,  from a painting by James Northcote

Drooling: A majestic picture of John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent, an admiral in the Royal Navy, from a painting by Francis Cotes, now has a dribbling baby face

Cheeky: Baby Captain Peter Hawker of the 14th Light Dragoons,  from a painting by James Northcote

Cute: Russian statesman and diplomat Alex. B. Kurakin now looks confused in this painting by Alexander Roslin
