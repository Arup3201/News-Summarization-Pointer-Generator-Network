A New Year reveller who became lost when he left a party was found drowned after sending a text to his girlfriend saying: 'At a river. No idea where to go from here'.

Warehouse supervisor Michael Simpson, 22, disappeared in the early hours of New Year's Day after wandering off from the fancy dress party to get some fresh air.

His girlfriend Jennifer Langley, also 22, sent him a text after he left the party to find out where he was only to get the final response: 'I don’t even know how I ended up here', before his mobile phone went dead.

His body was pulled out of the River Goyt in Bredbury, near Stockport, Greater Manchester eight days later.

It emerged Michael fell into the water just 150 yards from where the New Year’s Eve party was taking place.

A last photo of Mr Simpson with Ms Langley taken by a friend in the kitchen during the party captured him posing with a red fancy dress stethoscope around his neck.

Ms Langley told an inquest in Stockport how the couple had seen in the New Year together.

She said: 'We had a kiss at midnight, but twenty minutes later he had forgotten and gave me another kiss. At this stage he was quite drunk.'

Ms Langley said she saw Mr Simpson for the last time at about 2am. She said: 'He looked a bit bored. That was the last time I saw Michael.'

She texted Mr Simpson after becoming worried when she could not find him. She said: 'He said he was at a river and had no idea where he was.

'After that I tried ringing him a few times, his phone was dying and mine was as well.'

Mr Simpson's first reply to his girlfriend, received by her at 2.23am on New Year’s Day, said: 'At a river. No idea where to go from here.'

His second response, at 2.26am, told her to get a taxi back to his house and went on: 'I don’t even know how I ended up here.'

The inquest heard she rang him constantly but on failing to get hold of him, she contacted his brother via Facebook around 6am.

At 10am she walked to his house hoping she would come across him. But Mr Simpson had failed to return home and his father was already out searching for him.

An investigation was launched by the police and it was found he had been spotted on CCTV walking down towards the river.

The inquest heard from a security guard who was on the night shift at the nearby Pear Mill industrial estate who said he saw Mr Simpson as he walked past.

The guard said as he went to find Mr Simpson he saw him walk across a field and towards the river.

Detective Inspector Julie Bowden said the watch Mr Simpson was wearing as he was pulled from the river was 2.30am. She told the coroner that his phone switched off around 2.26am.

Det Insp Bowden also confirmed that Mr Simpson had only become lost in the area 150 yards from the party.

Pathologist Dr David Shelton confirmed the cause of death was drowning. Toxicology results confirmed there were no drugs found in his system but 228mg of alcohol was found in the blood - around three times more than the drink-drive limit.

Giving a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Joanne Kearsley, said drink had played a part in his death.

'He wasn’t found until January 9, but I am satisfied that he has died on January 1. The alcohol was a contributory factor.

'He and Jennifer enjoyed spending time 
together. Michael enjoyed life to the full and was often described as 
the life and soul of the party' 

- Denise Simpson

'There is no suggestion at all that he or anyone else had done anything improper, having left the party Michael had become disorientated, perhaps due to alcohol or perhaps he didn’t know the area or where he was.

'Michael himself realised he was at the river and didn’t know how he had managed to get there.

'He was a young man, he was popular with a lot of people. A number of people helped your family to search in the days he was missing.

'It is abundantly clear that he was a very much loved member of a close family.'

In a statement Mr Simpson's mother Denise Simpson said: 'He was a keen Man City supporter, he was planning to watch the game on New Year’s day.

'He and Jennifer enjoyed spending time together. Michael enjoyed life to the full and was often described as the life and soul of the party. He would only drink socially - he wouldn’t smoke or take drugs.'

She said she initially thought Mr Simpson had stayed over at his girlfriend's house when he failed to return home.

She said: 'Normally he would phone to say he wasn’t coming home. I thought, "Oh he must’ve just changed his mind and stayed with Jennifer".’
