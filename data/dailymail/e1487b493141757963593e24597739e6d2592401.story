A man has been sentenced to life in prison for killing and dismembering a Georgia college student and setting his remains on fire.

Kane Rolison pleaded guilty Monday to murder in the death of 19-year-old J'maal Keyes, who was a freshman at Middle Georgia State College when he was killed in April 2013.

Rolison admitted to stabbing Keyes more than a dozen times, dismembering him, lighting his remains on fire and eventually throwing them into a river.

Rolison was 17 at the time and charged as an adult.

In his admission, the now 19-year-old Rolison said he prayed for forgiveness because he was confused and lost in life.

Rolison said he and Keyes were acquaintances and blamed the attack on the influence of drugs.

Rolison could be eligible for parole in 30 years.

13WMAZ reports that the two met smoking cigarettes outside buildings on the college campus. 

Rolison reportedly took Keyes out to the woods to show him some marijuana plants he'd been growing. 

Besides pot, Keyes was taking LSD and several other drugs and had begun to think other people were computers or robots.

His lawyer described his actions as 'senseless.'
