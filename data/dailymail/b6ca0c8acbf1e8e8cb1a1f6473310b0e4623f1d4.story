Based on real events: The film, out July 2, follows Sgt Sarchie as he investigates a series of demonic possession in New York City

According to the film's IMDB page, Deliver Us From Evil, directed by Scott Derrickson and starring Olivia Munn, follows Sarchie as he combats demonic possessions that are terrorizing the city.

In a short video excerpt from the upcoming documentary Sarchie, the retired 16-year NYPD veteran reveals that he took part in more than 20 exorcisms, snippets of which are seen in the clip.

Sarchie got involved in what he calls 'the work' after reading the 1990 book Satan's Harvest about demonic possessions.

The officer from the 46th Precinct in South Bronx teamed up with a renegade Catholic priest, played in the upcoming film by Edgar Ramirez, performing exorcism rituals on people who were believed to be possessed by evil spirits.

All told, the former police sergeant investigated more than 50 paranormal cases, New York Post reported.

'I'm a demonologist, and I'm going head to head with the devil,' Sarchie says in the video.

Non-fiction: Deliver Us From Evil is based on a book Sarchie co-wrote in 2001 about his paranormal experiences

Sarchie and
 his collaborators used holy water, incense and the power of prayer to 
cleanse homes believed to be infested by demons.

Most of the cleansing rituals Sarchie assisted in took place in a church. The people suspected of being possessed were restrained, sometimes with a straightjacket.

In 2001, Sarchie co-wrote the book Beware the Night about his experiences as a part-time demon hunter in New York.

In an interview on the radio show Coast to Coast in 2004, Sarchie detailed some of his chilling encounters with poltergeist, like an 8-year-old girl who spoke fluent Latin and a Long Island housewife who made deep guttural sounds.

During a press conference last month about the upcoming film, Bana's co-star Munn, who plays his wife, told reporters that the 45-year-old Australian actor best known for his role as the Hulk could not sleep for three weeks while researching the events described in Sarchie's book.

Bana said he was 'coming from a skeptical place' when he agreed to play Sgt Sarchie.

'[Director] Scott [Derrickson] scared the bejeezus out of me in pre-production,’ Bana said. ‘He had access to some materials that Ralph Sarchie had.’
