The controversial hike would go ahead despite the Prime Minister's warning that the increase would be 'completely unacceptable'

MPs are likely to incur public fury with an inflation-busting ten per cent pay rise next year – an increase supported by the new head of Parliament's expenses watchdog.

The plan will see annual pay rise from £67,060 to £74,000, as predicted by The Mail on Sunday in May last year.

But Marcial Boo, who took up his post as chief executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority in June, insisted: 'It is not an excessive amount of money at all.'

He is reported to have said the controversial hike would go ahead despite the Prime Minister's warning that the increase would be 'completely unacceptable'. 

Mr Boo said politicians should not be paid a 'miserly amount' for their important job and their salaries needed to 'catch up' with their counterparts overseas.

But the proposal is likely to meet with outrage at a time when public sector workers' wage rises have been capped at one per cent. 

In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Boo said: 'This is an important job, the job of an MP. They are there to represent us all, to form laws, to send young people to war. It is not an easy thing to do. We want to have good people doing the job and they need to be paid fairly.

'Now, that's not paid in excess but it's not being paid a miserly amount either ...

'It's our job to reach the judgment of what the right amount is. There are lots and lots of professionals in public life and in the private sector who earn a lot more than that - so it is not an excessive amount of money at all.'

MPs are already due a one per cent increase to £67,731 next April, and under Ipsa's plan is will rise again a month later to £74,000.

The watchdog has said it will conduct one further review of the pay rise after the election - as it is legally obliged to do - but Mr Boo made clear its conclusions were unlikely to shift.

'We were allowing for any change in economic circumstances,' he said. 'At that time we had only just emerged from recession, it wasn't quite clear we were going to have the growth that we have got now as a country, so we left the option open to change the position.

'As of now, September, it doesn't look like there is any major economic factor that would change the determination that we reached in 2013.'

He added: 'Parliament as a whole has created an independent body to set MPs' pay. We have gone through the process in a really rigorous way. It is not an arbitrary figure that we have come up with.

'Obviously, it is for parliament to decide whether they want to take back responsibility for setting their own pay. I don't believe that's right.

'I think we are in a better position as a country now when we have an independent, transparent regulator that is tasked with determining MPs' remuneration.

'This is the number that we've come up with and we talked both to the public and to MPs about it. But if Parliament wants to change its mind and to change our remit then that's clearly for them.'

Mr Boo - whose own £120,000 salary is £10,000 more than that of his predecessor - insisted a change in the law would be needed to prevent Ipsa following through on its proposals.

Another potential block to the pay rise was removed over the summer, when Ipsa chairman Sir Ian Kennedy was reappointed for another 18 months - meaning he will remain in post after the general election.
