A man committed a sex act in a hospital ward in front of a ten-week-old baby, a court was told today.

Liam Marrow, 25, of Fleetwood, Lancashire, was arrested at Blackpool Victoria Hospital and charged with engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child, Blackpool Magistrates’ Court heard.

Marrow was also charged with four counts of sexually assaulting a child by penetration. The offences were alleged to have taken place between last December and last Sunday, the court was told.

Meanwhile Catherine Blackburn, 21, also of Fleetwood, was charged with causing or allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm.

The sexual assault on the child allegedly took place off hospital premises, but the sexual activity in front of the child allegedly took place inside the hospital, Tracy Yates, prosecuting, said.

Marrow was remanded in custody to appear at Preston Crown Court and Blackburn was bailed. Both will appear at the court again in two weeks’ time on March 7.

A Lancashire Constabulary spokesman said
before the court hearing: ‘Two people have been arrested after a 
10-week-old baby was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital with 
injuries.

‘The baby was admitted to the hospital on Sunday and police were informed about the injuries and launched an immediate investigation.

‘A 25-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman, both from Fleetwood, were arrested at Blackpool Victoria Hospital on Monday.'
