The Pope's Harley Davidson motorbike has sold at auction for a miraculous £200,000 - 20 times its original valuation.

Dozens of potential buyers attended the auction at the Grand Palais (Great Palace) in Paris, all of them hoping to get their hands on the 1,585cc Dyna Super Glide.

It was given to Pope Francis last June as a gift from Harley-Davidson to mark the American company's 110th anniversary.

Pope Francis announced he was selling one of his two Harley Davidson motorbikes and hopes to raise £12,000 for charity. But it fetched more than £200,000 at auction

The
 Pontiff later donated the motorbike to the Caritas Roma charity, which 
works on behalf of the Catholic Church to support the poor.

Now all the money raised will go on renovating a hostel and a soup kitchen in the Italian capital.

The
 superbike, which has the signature 'Francis' on its petrol tank, was 
expected to fetch between around £10,000 and £12,000, but an anonymous 
phone buyer was successful with a 241,500 euro bid - the equivalent of 
just over £200,000.

At the time the Pope laid his hands on a disabled Angel during the open blessing in the Vatican City

A 'Pope' leather biker jacket which accompanied the motorbike also sold for £41,000.

Numerous potential buyers were turned away because there were too many for the auction house to cope.

Before
 the bike went on the hammer, Ben Walker, of British auction house 
Bonhams said: 'We are incredibly honoured to be selling this item on 
behalf of Caritas Roma.

'We 
hope to be able to do both Pope Francis and Harley-Davidson proud by 
raising a significant amount of money for a very worthy cause.'

Pope Francis, 77, is not thought to have ridden the Harley - a brand more commonly associated with Hell's Angel gangs.
