As the countdown to the greatest show on earth begins, Michelle Obama met David Beckham today to help kick start the Olympics - with a quick game of football.

Proving the First Lady has that competitive edge she gave Team USA a rousing pep talk just hours ahead of the
opening ceremony, urging the athletes to 'have fun - but also win'.

She met America's sports stars at their training 
base in east London, where she thanked them for their inspiring 
determination and said it was 'otherworldly' to be in London to witness 
them on the world stage.

With
cheerleaders and a band welcoming her, Mrs Obama then hosted an 
exercise session as part of her 'Let's Move!' anti-obesity campaign, 
where she put on an affectionate and jovial display with British 
footballer David Beckham, who gave her tips on her soccer skills.

'Wow - I’m going to be saying 
that a lot over the next few days. Wow! I can’t believe I am here, I
am beyond proud,' she enthused at the breakfast event.

'Some
of my fondest memories growing up and even as an adult for that matter 
involved watching the Olympics on TV. I know each of you probably were 
in that position. Being here is otherworldly for me, you know. I am 
still so inspired by all of you. I am still in awe of everything you 
have achieved.'

Mrs Obama, dressed in a patriotic 
red-and-white striped jacket, added with a smile: 'Try to have fun. Try 
to breathe a little bit. But also win, right? In the end winning is 
good.'

Her pep talk came as the Olympic torch started the final leg of its epic 8,000 mile journey to the Olympic Stadium. It
will be carried to the Stratford stadium in east London on Friday night
and lit by a mystery VIP at the hotly anticipated Opening Ceremony, 
where Mrs Obama will have a ringside seat.

She
is also expected to attend a reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth at 
Buckingham Palace and meet Samantha Cameron, the wife of British Prime 
Minister David Cameron, whom she has met on previous visits.

But
the highlight of her visit will no doubt be the opening ceremony - a 
three-hour extravaganza which will be watched by a global audience of 
more than one billion, begins at 2000 GMT - 3 p.m. ET.

With
crowds swarming to meet Mrs Obama, it was a warmer welcome than that 
for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who has come under 
fire for labelling preparations for the event 'disconcerting', sparking 
outrage from the public and Mr Cameron.

Mrs Obama, speaking
at the University of East London on Friday morning, added that watching
the Olympics had inspired her father, who suffered from multiple 
sclerosis, to retain his athletic spirit.

'In a matter of several years he went 
from a man who was once a thriving competitor - he was a boxer and 
swimmer throughout high school - and then he was stripped of all of his 
hopes,' she said.

'But he 
retained his love of sports truly. And the Olympics was a special time 
for him to watch amazing athletes of all abilities compete on the world 
stage... So these games especially affected our little house on the 
south side of Chicago.'

She
went on: 'You never know who you are inspiring. You just never know. 
From a family like ours on the south side of Chicago to young athletes 
who are going to pick up a soccer ball or start running after watching 
something that you all do.

'I know for many of you that's how you got here watching someone else ... we are proud of you all.  You have got a country back home who is rooting for you every single second, so you have already won. And try to have some fun.'

After her speech, Mrs Obama met the athletes, posing for photographs, 
before leaving for her Let’s Move! sporting event - part of her anti-obesity campaign - at the U.S. Ambassador's 
residence in central London for about 1,000 U.S. military children plus American
and British students.

The children, who gathered at the residence at Winfield in Regents 
Park, tried out different sports, including tennis, football and basketball, and met some of sports' top stars.

Former Denver Nuggets star Dikemne Mutombo was giving the youngsters a 
lesson in basketball. The 46-year-old, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, 
said he was 'so happy 
that the First Lady and the US Embassy were able to put this together'.

'I support anything that takes our children away from their computers, their GameBoys and their TVs,' he added.

Her speech came as the Olympic
torch began the final leg of its epic 8,000 mile journey to the Olympic
Stadium this morning sailing triumphantly along the River Thames on 
board the Queen's majestic Jubilee barge. It completed the mammoth journey at Tower Bridge at 12.45 p.m GMT.

Back on dry land, he said: 'It was marvellous, absolutely marvellous. 
The whole thing went fantastically, there were boats everywhere and the 
banks were lined with thousands of people. The master plan worked, which
is wonderful - the torchbearers, the crews and the crowds all played 
their part.

'It's a great way to bring the flame into central London, using the highway of London.'

He said he was always confident the weather would hold up, adding: 'It 
doesn't rain on my parade - and it was never going to be as cold as the 
Jubilee pageant.' A total of 400 rowers took part on 90 boats.

The torch arrived by boat at City Hall, where it went inside for a 
reception with London Mayor Boris Johnson, Lord Coe and other 
dignitaries.
