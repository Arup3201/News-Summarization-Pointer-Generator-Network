A woman killed in an explosion at a firework display on Saturday has been named as mother-of-three Polly Connor.

Plumber Polly, 46, from Kendal, Cumbria, was working at the wedding of John Simpson and Nicole Rothwell at their home in Ecclerigg, on the shores of the lake Windermere.

She was helping a friend who organised firework displays and was killed in the ensuing blaze.

Another man - yet to be identified - also died. Mrs Connor leaves behind her husband Damien and three children Molly, 15, Daisy, 13, and Oscar, 10.

Fire rampaged through outbuildings at the wedding reception in Windermere, Cumbria, on Saturday afternoon

Polly's mother, stepfather and brother all heard the blast and saw white smoke rising from the site, but it was only later in the day that they learned what had happened.

Her brother Russell Colman, of Bowness, had been at his photographic studio on the edge of Windermere with his mother Penny Benson and stepfather John Benson.

Mr Colman said: 'We heard the explosion. It sounded like thunder, very loud. But then we realised it was something else. Moments later we saw white smoke,' he said.

'It wasn't until I got a phone call in the evening asking me to go urgently to Polly's house that I put it all together in my head.'

Mrs Benson paid tribute to her daughter.

 'She was our sunshine and now she's disappeared,' she said. 

'You always felt better for seeing her. We are incredibly proud of her.

'All the tributes that have come in are exactly how she was and we are so incredibly grateful for that. 

'She worked so hard and put 100 per cent into everything she did. She thought of others before herself all the time.

'But she was a girly girl, she loved dressing up and going out dancing with her friends.

'I just can't describe how much we will miss her and how much grief we feel at her loss.

'She was adored by everyone, especially Damien and her children. She was wonderful, a person with a beautiful spirit who will be terribly missed.'

Mrs Connor's mother Penny Benson said: 'She was our sunshine and now she's disappeared'

Mrs Connor ran her own plumbing business called 'Polly the Plumber' and was at the event in an official capacity working with a colleague. She had worked with the man in construction but he also organised firework displays at public events.

Polly's brother, photographer Russell Colman said: 'She had done this sort of thing before and I know that when they worked together they worked incredibly carefully.

'We are just devastated at this time.

'Growing up, we were like the three amigos: mum, Polly and me. She was little but so tough. She wasn't just the glue or the rock or the scaffolding to her family. She was the whole world to them.'

She met her husband Damien, a former jockey, also 46, while working in the racing industry

Mrs Connor was a former clerk of the course for the Macau Jockey Club and had worked internationally as a rider and head groom at racing stables all over the world.

She met her husband Damien, a former jockey, also 46, while working in the racing industry.

They moved to Kendal 10 years ago where she retrained as a plumber at night school while bringing up her family and after establishing her business worked as plumber across the construction industry as well as for private clients.

Stepfather John Benson said she was humble and modest about her many talents and had an unmistakable laugh.

He said: 'She brought everything together in the most remarkable way. She was lovely, delicate and a girly but also a tomboy.

'It's hard to describe someone with such an opposing combination of characteristics but in Polly, there there were.

'We're just so upset we can't say any more.'

Guests at the reception on the shores of Lake Windermere fled in terror when they heard the explosion and saw smoke and fireworks, shortly after the bride and groom had posed for photographs on Saturday afternoon.

Around 70 guests were mingling in the marquee of the countryside wedding venue when there was an 'enormous explosion' as fireworks went off in a nearby outbuilding, sparking a huge fire, witnesses said.

The area was evacuated and the celebration had to be cancelled as firemen rushed to the reception, being held at a beauty spot yards from Lake Windermere in Cumbria. 

Insurance firm boss John Simpson, 61, married Nicole Rothwell, 44, and were holding the reception in the grounds of their lakeside home when the first started at 3.35pm on Saturday.

Mrs Connor was a former clerk of the course for the Macau Jockey Club and had worked internationally as a rider and head groom at racing stables all over the world.

They are believed to have had a register office ceremony earlier in the week and held the party to celebrate it with family and friends on Saturday.

One of the musicians, who asked not to be named, said: 'It was a beautiful day and we were playing on the terrace just after the photographs were taken.

'The bride was in her gown in the garden with the groom and the fireworks just started going off. The flaming debris was falling all around.

'The firework display was spectacular, but we were wondering why it was being held in the bright daylight.

'Then we realised something shocking had happened. We grabbed our instruments and ran.'

He said 'everyone was in complete shock' and the bride was 'obviously extremely upset.'

Scene: There were around 70 guests in the marquee, pictured, when the fireworks suddenly exploded

Neighbour Enid Battersby said: 'All of a sudden there was an enormous explosion. I have never heard anything like it since the blitz in Manchester.'

There then followed loud 'booms and pops' and thick smoke could be seen.

It is understood there was going to be a big fireworks display later in the evening as the grand finale of the wedding celebration.

Tourist Anthony Middleton was at the nearby Brockhole Visitor Centre with his family when they saw fireworks shooting into the sky.

Panic: Police and firemen interviewed the 70 wedding guests who had been in the marquee at the time

He said: 'We heard this almighty explosion and the best way to describe that would be a series of earth-shaking cannons going off. 

'The ground was shaking. We looked up and saw exhibition fireworks illuminating the daytime sky. That was followed by thick grey smoke and we obviously realised there was a fire nearby.

'Explosions were going off all the time, we could see the fireworks coming out from behind the trees. It appeared to us the fireworks had been stored in this wooden building that was on fire.

'We realised something disastrous was taking place. I could almost feel the heat of the fire.'

Another witness from the visitor centre said: 'There was an explosion that sounded like thunder and then lots of fireworks went off. There were clouds of black smoke, we had no idea what happened.'

Explosion: The bride and groom were in the garden when flaming debris started to fly in their direction

The national park visitor centre at Brockhole was packed with hundreds of tourists enjoying the last weekend of the summer holidays.

Stuart Halliwell, the operations manager on the site, said one of his staff helped evacuate wedding reception guests away from the fire scene. 

He said: 'It must have been awful for the couple on their special day. It is obviously a tragedy but we could have been even worse than it was.'

A fire service spokesman said four fire engines were sent to the scene to tackle a 'well developed fire involving the two outbuildings.'

A Cumbria Police spokesman said they were called after a 'shed containing fireworks was on fire.' A vehicle nearby was also damaged by the blaze.

Investigation: The man and woman have yet to be identified and police stayed late at the scene investigating

'Two bodies, believed to be a male and a female, were found. Police and the fire service are investigating the circumstances that led to the fire.'

Detective Chief Inspector Mike Brown said: 'We are still trying to examine the circumstances and the cause of the fire.'

Mr Simpson was a partner in a local insurance company which he co-founded 30 years ago.
