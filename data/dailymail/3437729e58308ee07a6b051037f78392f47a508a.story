'Like Father, Like Son': Anton Ferdinand posted a picture of the cover of The Game's song on Twitter

Footballer Anton Ferdinand has joked about the racism charge faced by John Terry’s father, by saying that he was listening to a rap song called 'Like Father, Like Son'.

The 28-year-old Queens Park Rangers defender posted a picture of the cover of The Game’s song on Twitter and told his 340,000 followers: ‘Don't you just love it when your music is on shuffle #nowplaying’.

Ted Terry, 59, was arrested earlier this year after a scuffle on Fenchurch Street in central London, before being charged with two racially motivated offences on Tuesday when he answered bail.

The tweet was posted by Ferdinand on Tuesday at about 9pm, within hours of the news breaking.

Ferdinand accused former England captain John Terry of racially abusing him during a match at Loftus Road in October 2011. Terry denied this and was cleared of the charge on a criminal standard of proof in a law court.

The verdict last year brought to an end a long saga which saw Chelsea defender Terry stripped of the national captaincy and England manager Fabio Capello resign in protest.

He was eventually banned for four games and fined £220,000 by the Football Association, which found against him under a lower burden of proof of racially abusing Ferdinand.

This was decided on the balance of probabilities, rather than beyond reasonable doubt, which was the measure used in the criminal courts.

The offences Ted Terry answered bail to this week are a common assault and a public order offence.

Two other men, Tudor Musteata, 47, and Stephen Niland, 36, were also charged following the fracas at 8pm on March 22.

Claims: The incident between John Terry (left) and Anton Ferdinand (right) in 2011 was the latest controversy in a chequered career for Terry, which included his arrest following a fight at a nightclub in 2002

They both face a single allegation that they caused a ‘fear of violence’ that was racially aggravated.

City
of London Police, which is responsible for the inquiry, declined to 
elaborate on exactly what is alleged to have taken place.

Answered bail: Ted Terry, 59, was charged after a scuffle on Fenchurch Street in central London

A spokesman said: ‘As charges have now been brought we are unable to comment further on the nature of the incident.’

The incident between John Terry and Ferdinand in 2011 was the latest controversy in a chequered career for Terry, which included his arrest following a fight at a nightclub in 2002.

He was later cleared of four charges, including affray and wounding with intent.

John Terry and Chelsea team-mates were also accused of drunkenly mocking American tourists following the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001.

In November 2010, Ted Terry suffered a serious head injury when he was attacked by fans from rival club Tottenham Hotspur. He was taken to hospital for stitches after the late evening attack at Upminster station in East London.

John Terry’s mother Sue, 55, and mother-in-law Sue Poole, 59, were cautioned for shoplifting from Tesco and Marks & Spencer in 2009.

Ted Terry, of Grays, Essex, Musteata, of Greenwich, south-east London, and Niland, of Romford, Essex, were released on bail. All three men were ordered to appear before City of London Magistrates’ Court on July 23.
