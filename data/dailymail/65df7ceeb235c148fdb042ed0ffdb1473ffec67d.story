Italian police have smashed an international gang smuggling dozens of illegal immigrants into Britain using fake documents.

To get into the country, the racket allegedly provided identity cards and simply inserted new photographs and charged 'customers' between £6,000 and £10,000.

The method was eventually clocked by Italian border guards at Rome airport which the gang used as its onward hub.

'Crime ring': Police said the scam involved Albanians travelling initially to Turkey and then onto Britain via Rome

Officials said that in total 21 people - including a retired police officer - had been held in the operation which was code named Eagle and further arrests were also planned.

Police said that the legitimate holders of the identity card were involved in the scam and would be paid a cut.

The scam involved Albanians travelling initially to Turkey and then onto Britain via Rome.

The
 illegal immigrants would be 'accompanied' through Italian passport 
control to help provide a cover and so as not to arouse suspicion.

But
 the gang were rumbled after one passport official began to closely 
examine an identity card which he suspected was false and the 'owner' 
then ran off.

Footage 
provided by Italian police showed a couple walking through passport 
control after having their documents checked - the woman was allegedly travelling 
on a false identity card.

Rome
 airport police chief Antonio Del Greco said: 'The operation was highly 
organised and highly lucrative as people were charged up to 10,000 euros
 (£8,000) a time.

'We 
suspect that at least a dozen people a week travelled to Britain using 
this method and it was arranged along the lines of a travel agency.

'The
 illegal immigrants were provided with false documents and accompanied 
to passport control by an Italian who would then travel with them to 
provide cover.

'The operation lasted 18 months and although we suspect a dozen people a week went through the true figure could be many more.'

It
 comes just days after it emerged French fishing boats had been used to 
smuggle dozens of Albanian illegal immigrants across the Channel to 
remote beaches and cove along the south coast.
