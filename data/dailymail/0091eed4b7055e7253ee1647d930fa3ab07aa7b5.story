The son of the man arrested on suspicion of abducting April Jones has joined the search for the missing five-year-old, it has emerged.

Scott Williams told reporters that he has been looking for April ever since she disappeared at 7pm on Monday evening from near her home in Machynlleth. 

Mark Bridger, 46, was arrested on suspicion of abduction on Tuesday afternoon as he walked along a road on the outskirts of the Mid Wales market town wearing a camouflage jacket and waterproof trousers.

He has been in custody ever since and
this morning police revealed they now have until 5pm tomorrow to 
question him over April's disappearance.

Since Monday night hundreds of volunteers from the local area have been scouring the local area to look for the child - including Mr Williams.

The 19-year-old told Sky News that his father's arrest was nothing to do 
with his family.

He said: 'He has never been in my life. I have 
only met him on a couple of occasions like down the local pub – he's 
been there a couple of times that I've been there.

'But it was a shock when we heard it on the news that he'd been arrested.'

He added that he had joined the local community to search for April 'since she's gone missing', and said that his father had 'never done anything to anyone'.

Mr Williams' mother is local woman Julie Williams, who Bridger married in June 1990 in Machynlleth, but the couple have not spoken for years.

Today police have continued to appeal for information about Bridger's whereabouts between 6.30pm on Monday and 3.30pm on Tuesday.

Yesterday officers took the unusual step of issuing a photograph of 
Bridger and of his Land Rover – although officers stressed that he is 
only one of several lines of inquiry.

His complex private life 
began to emerge as it was revealed he has a 
colourful love life and a long line of different jobs.

He has worked at various times as a welder, a mechanic, a hotel porter and did shifts at an abattoir.

Born in Sutton, Surrey, the Bridger was known to April’s parents Coral, 40, and Paul, 43, after his move to Wales in the 1980s.

The divorcee has had a string of 
relationships in Machynlleth, and he has fathered at least 
three children with two women on the Bryn-y-Gog estate where April 
lives.

Railwayman Glen Lewis, 50, remembers him moving to the town to work as a lifeguard 15 years ago around the time the leisure centre was built.

'I know him well enough to wave to. I’ve always thought of him as a bit of a ladies man,' he said today.

Friends described him as being a regular visitor on the estate.

It has been previously suggested that he is a former soldier but there 
is no record of him ever having been employed by the Ministry of 
Defence.

Bridger is still on good terms with Elaine Dafydd, the mother to two of 
his children. Mrs Dafydd is now married to a new partner and has a four-year-old girl.

Up until two years ago, Bridger was living with a local woman named Corinna Robinson, but they have since split up.

Press conference: Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan holds pictures of Bridger and his vehicle at a media conference. He confirmed the 46-year-old was being questioned at Aberysytwyth Police Station

Neighbours said he had been living with another woman on the estate, Vicky Fenner, but she ended the relationship last month.

One former neighbour said: ‘He has had a lot of women and goes from one to another.

‘Looking back now, it seems like  a lot of relationships but these 
things can happen in life. He’s never been single for long and has 
always got on with people even though  this is a very small community – 
everyone knows everyone else’s business here.’

Locals described Bridger as quiet but friendly, and revealed that he was a member of the local pub darts and cricket teams.

One said: ‘Mark had always  been very friendly and trying to  fit in since he moved here 20-odd years ago.

'There must be someone out there who knows where she is': Mrs Jones made an emotional appeal to anyone with information about April's whereabouts, urging them to come forward

‘April and Mark’s kids were all friends in one big group, so April would have known who Mark was.’

Bridger had been staying in a small whitewashed farmhouse in Ceinws, five miles north  of Machynlleth.

The road to the town was blocked off yesterday and police were searching rivers and a quarry in the area.

There was also a police presence at the farmhouse, where the suspect had
been living for just two weeks. 

Neighbours told how police had been 
systematically searching the property along with nearby factory units 
and farm buildings.

Superintendent Ian John said the results of the forensic examination of Bridger’s vehicle had been ‘fast-tracked’.
