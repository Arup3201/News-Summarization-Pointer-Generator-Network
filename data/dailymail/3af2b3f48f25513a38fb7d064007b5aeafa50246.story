Liverpool are compiling a dossier on the fitness issues that have plagued Daniel Sturridge’s career after it emerged he has injured his left thigh nine times.

The England striker is faced with another six week lay-off after he broke down in training on Monday. It is the second time this season Sturridge has injured the muscle, but Liverpool’s medical staff are now processing his history from previous clubs in an attempt to get to the bottom of it and an operation cannot be ruled out. 

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, who will meet Sturridge on Friday to discuss the situation, said: 'Most players you’ll find want to play through an injury to get on to the field. Obviously that’s what you do.

Daniel Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August and now could be out until next year

Sturridge scored 28 goals for club and country last season and was in blistering form

Ankle ligaments - England v Republic of Ireland May 2013, returned for pre-season.

Ankle ligaments - December 2013. Missed nine games.

Thigh - during England training, September 2014. Missed six weeks.

Calf - during Liverpool training, October 2014. Missed three weeks.

Thigh - during Liverpool training, November 2014. Out for six weeks.

‘It was in a session and quite an innocuous action. He did it when he just flicked the ball. It wasn’t a shot or anything that looked serious. But obviously he felt the pain and then when the medical team told me the next day after the scan, it was disappointing.

‘Now we just have to concentrate and focus on the players we do have. It’s that simple. Though of course it’s hugely disappointing to lose a player of that quality.

‘I think that’s his ninth injury on that thigh from previous clubs and here.

‘So there is an issue there somewhere. This shows a slight tear just below where he had a previous injury (in September).

‘Most players you’ll find want to play through an injury to get on to the field. Obviously that’s what you do.’

Liverpool have laboured in front of goal in the absence of Sturridge. Rodgers, though, is not certain that going out to spend money in the transfer window is how to solve his problems. ‘We have to look at the players we have,’ said Rodgers, whose side face Crystal Palace on Sunday.
