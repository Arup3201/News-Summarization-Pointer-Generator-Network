Rob Green made the save, but Eduardo Vargas had as much to do with Alexis Sanchez's missed penalty as his QPR team-mate did.

Arsenal forward Sanchez stepped up to take a penalty inside nine minutes of the Boxing Day London derby but little did he know his Chile team-mate Eduardo Vargas was signalling to Green which way to dive.

Vargas was clearly seen pointing to Rangers No 1 Green to tell him which way to dive and the former England No 1 duly obliged, leaping to his left to keep out the spot-kick.

Sanchez and Vargas are close friends having played together for Chile since 2010, but the Arsenal hitman may have to be more wary about what he divulges to his compatriot in future...

Sure enough, Sanchez went the way Vargas pointed and Green guessed right

Green gets his hand down to thwart Sanchez and keep the score at 0-0
