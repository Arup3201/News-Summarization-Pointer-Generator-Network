James Corden pulled out all the stops for his opening night on US TV - breaking a showbiz exclusive, performing alongside a Hollywood legend and roping in some of his most famous celebrity friends.

He made sure his first show went off with a bang with a opening sequence in which he joked he got the job by finding a golden ticket in a Willy Wonka-style chocolate bar. 

The sketch included appearances from Simon Cowell, Girls creator Lena Dunham, Billy Crystal, Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne and comedian Chris Rock ,all devastated or furious after opening chocolate bars without the golden ticket inside, before Corden found the winning ticket in the street.

The piece then showed how Jay Leno, Shia LaBeouf, and Arnold Schwarznegger whipped him into shape for his new role.

Schwarzegger shouted at him 'You don't look like a talk show host, you look like two' while Leno waterboarded him for preparation.

Meryl Streep then appeared to tell the London-born comic he was ready to a become a star.

Corden added to the star power on display by bringing on his guests, Tom Hanks and Mila Kunis.

Kunis delivered an exclusive for his inaugural show by reluctantly revealing that she and partner Ashton Kutcher 'might' have got married.

Asked by Corden if she had tied the knot, she replied: 'I don't know, maybe.' 

Prompted by gestures from Hanks, the host inspected the huge ring on Kunis's hand and declared 'Oh, you got married! They got married, everyone! Oh my god, Mr and Mrs Kutcher!'

Corden introduced himself to American audiences as he admitted he was stunned to be making a star-packed debut with his late-night talk show.

He was greeted by a whooping crowd including his wife, parents and celebrity friend Piers Morgan for his first outing as host of the Late Late Show on US network CBS.

Corden is relatively unknown in America and he immediately addressed that fact as he opened the programme, which airs at 12.35am.

'I feel I should tell you a little bit about myself,' he said.

'My name is James Corden and I'm 36 years old and I'm from a place called High Wycombe in Great Britain, which you almost certainly will never have heard of because most people in Great Britain haven't heard of it so I don't expect you to.'

He added: 'I'm married, sorry ladies, this ship has sailed.'

Gesturing to his newly slimmed-down frame, he said: 'This don't stay on the shelf too long.'

Addressing the cameras in front of a studio audience at CBS studios in Los Angeles, he added: 'We have two children - my son was four yesterday and my daughter is 16 weeks old - and I really couldn't be more honoured to be stood here talking to you now and, believe me, however shocked you are that I am standing here doing this job, you will never be as shocked as I am.'

He added: 'I promise you we will have fun on this show and I promise we will do everything we can to put a smile on your face before or, let's be honest, more likely while you fall asleep at night.

'It really isn't lost on me what a privilege it is to be given a show like this and I really will do my best not to let any of you down.'

The actor thanked his parents for flying over from the UK to watch his debut.

He said: 'They have never been to Los Angeles before and they are already loving it, they are eating kale every day, my mum is getting a boob job next week.

He choked on his words and wiped away a tear as he added: 'Thank you for being here, thank you for making the trip, I really appreciate it.'

One of the show's biggest hits among fans

Other highlights of the show included Corden and Hanks performing a five-minute retrospective of Hanks' many films, complete with wigs and green screen backdrops.

Corden took the unusual step of ending the show with a musical number before the end credits.

Critics said the idea made the show stand out from other talk shows, though questioned whether the comedian would be able to sing the show out very week.
