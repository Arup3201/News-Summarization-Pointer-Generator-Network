Juggling a busy career with becoming a mother isn't the easiest of tasks but Zara Phillips appears to be managing it with aplomb.

Arriving at the Teme Valley Hunt point-to-point, Zara showed off her mult-tasking skills as she fed daughter Mia Grace while having a chat on the phone.

The no-nonsense new mother followed up her conversation with a couple of text messages before heading off along the racecourse at Brampton Bryan in Herefordshire to prepare her horse, Youhaveto, for an appearance on the track.

Accompanied by the royal's two dogs, a black labrador and a boxer, Zara appeared on cheerful form as she strolled along in the sunshine.

As they neared the enclosure, Zara even found time to pose for a photo with a young fan - much to the youngster's delight.

Ever the professional, the royal was later seen dispensing a few last minute tips to the jockey before settling down to watch the action - and the gorgeous spring sunshine.

The point-to-point season is a busy time for Zara, who has had runners in every meet since January; most recently at the Gatcombe Horse Trials last weekend.

A well-respected Olympic silver-medal winning eventer in her own right, Zara has built up a successful racing business and has even trained racehorses for her mother, the Princess Royal.

As a result, Mia has become a regular sight on the racecourse, although her father Mike Tindall seems to prefer spending his Sundays at home.

He did, however, put in an appearance at Gatcombe Park last week and at the Cheltenham Festival earlier this month, as did his mother-in-law Princess Anne and the Duchess of Cornwall.

The Duchess, who was accompanied by her son Tom Parker-Bowles, enjoyed a particularly successful trip to the races, pocketing a wad of Â£20 notes handed over by her disgruntled son after losing a bet with his mother.
