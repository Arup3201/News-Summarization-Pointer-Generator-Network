Europe's most valuable living artist has found himself at the centre of an £8million lawsuit over a painting said to be one of his earliest works.

Peter Doig has long admitted that as a teenager he ran away from home and moved to Canada, where he wandered the landscape taking LSD.

But now a parole officer claims the future artist was arrested for drug possession, and spent several months in juvenile detention.

The officer says that he spotted the young Mr Doig's artistic talents, and bought a painting from him for $100 - and now he is demanding that the painter authenticate the work, which could be worth millions.

Dispute: A former parole officer is suing artist Peter Doig over this painting, claiming he bought it from the Scotsman while he was serving time in detention for drug possession

The Scottish-born artist, 53, insists the picture is not in fact his work, and dismisses the allegations as a fabrication.

Mr Doig set a record for the highest price ever fetched by a living European artist in February of this year, when his work The Architect's House in the Ravine was sold for $12million (£7.8million).

Before attending art school in London
as a young man, he spent several years in Canada - but has never made 
it entirely clear what he was doing there.

Robert
Fletcher, who worked as a parole officer at Thunder Bay Correctional 
Centre in Ontario in the mid-1970s, claims he came across the teenaged 
Mr Doig while he was serving a five-month sentence for possession of 
LSD.

Denial: Mr Doig insists the work is not by him and says he was not arrested as the man claims

In papers filed at a federal court in Chicago, he described seeing him work on a painting of a desert landscape, painted on a linen canvas measuring 34in by 41in.

According to the Courthouse News Service, the documents continue: 'Fletcher helped Doig in his search for employment, and helped him to obtain employment through the Seafarers Union in Thunder Bay.

'Fletcher also encouraged Doig to pursue his artistic talent, and accepted Doig's offer to sell the work to Fletcher for $100.

'Since that day in or about 1976 and to the present, Fletcher has owned the work.'

The painting is signed with the name 'Pete Doige', which Mr Fletcher claims was the name Mr Doig used during his time in detention.

The former parole officer says that a friend suggested to him that the work could be by the artist, due to its similarities to other landscapes by Mr Doig.

Some experts have pointed out that its eery atmosphere and empty landscape are reminiscent of the artist's other works, but others claim that it is not impressionistic enough to be by him.

Mr Fletcher is now attempting to sell the work through a Chicago gallery - but the painting will only be considered valuable if it is authenticated by the artist himself.

Mr Doig has vehemently denied that the picture is his, saying he has not been to Thunder Bay and was never jailed on drugs charges.

Similarities? Some experts compare the painting to works such as Canoe-Lake, pictured, but others disagree

His dealer, Gordon VeneKlasen, wrote in an email to Mr Fletcher: 'Not only does Mr Doig not know the owner of this work, he has never been to the place it is supposedly painted.

'The painting is NOT by Peter Doig. Anyone can see that. We are not interested in any further communication related to this.

'Good luck in finding the real artist for this. Any attempt to attribute this painting to Peter Doig in any way will be dealt with by our attorneys.'

Mr Fletcher is hoping a judge will declare that the work is in fact by Mr Doig - which could raise its value to many millions of dollars.

He is also seeking damages from the artist, claiming that he has 'interfered with prospective economic advantage' because his denial lowers the painting's value.

Mr Doig's lawyer told the Independent: 'The case has absolutely no basis in fact. The painting is not a Peter Doig and the allegations have been entirely fabricated.'
