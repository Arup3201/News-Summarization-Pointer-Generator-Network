Brooklyn Beckham is following in his father's footsteps by training at Manchester United, it was revealed last night.

The 14-year-old, who is the eldest of David and Victoria Beckham's four children, was at the Premier League football club’s Carrington training ground yesterday accompanied by his father.

Brooklyn had trials at Chelsea in January and has been training at Queens Park Rangers, notably figuring with Dennis Wise's son Henry for their Under-14s against Charlton Athletics in September.

Although training there is unlikely to result in a permanent association with the club just yet, United want to take a closer look at Brooklyn as he test his skills and tries to carve out a football career.

A source told the Manchester Evening News: 'He was there with his dad and took part in a practice session with one of the academy sides. It was a chance for him to impress.'

The source added: ‘If he’s done well then no doubt the club will look at taking him on.'

The news comes as it was revealed this week that Beckham is finalising plans to start a Major League Soccer franchise in Florida, and hoping Brooklyn could feature on the team sheet one day.

While wary about putting any pressure on 
his children to follow in his famous footsteps, the former England 
captain said he hoped Brooklyn could be good enough to play in his team 
one day.

Five months after retiring from football, Beckham has been putting the finishing touches to investment plans before asking the MLS to allow him to start up an expansion franchise in Miami.

Brooklyn has already shown he could be the next Beckham to make it as a professional footballer.  Asked if he would like to see Brooklyn in his MLS team, Beckham said: ‘Yes, hopefully.'

His younger brother Romeo, 12, has also enjoyed training with Arsenal's academy. The Beckham boys have always been in close attendance to their father throughout his career.

They turned up at training occasionally alongside his Paris Saint-Germain teammates such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva. Indeed, Brooklyn's football skills have been witnessed at Old Trafford.

He was introduced to the stadium crowd at the tender age of just two when he accompanied his father on United's lap of honour following their Premiership title triumph of 2001.

Even then in front of the massed photographers he showed an aptitude for the game by scoring an impromptu goal.
