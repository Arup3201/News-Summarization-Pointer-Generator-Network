The famous statues of the Louvre have been given a makeover.

French photographer Léo Calliard, 27, from Paris, teamed up with digital imaging retoucher Alexis Persani to dress the Greek Agora masterpieces in clothes more likely to be seen on Shoreditch hipsters.

'I had this idea when I was walking in the Louvre Museum looking at different sculptures,' Calliard tells MailOnline.

'These sculptures represent most of the time Gods or important people very far from our every day life. To make them "iconic", their sculptor made them naked, without any element from a specific period of time.

'I realised that it would make a 
great series of pictures if I could dress these statues up. Of course, 
it was impossible to do it in real life as the museum wouldn't let me 
touch the statues.'

'I started to think about the way to 
do it and I finally found the right process. I made a casting of models 
to find people with the same body shape as the statues. Then, I did a 
photoshoot in a studio with these models dressed in hipster clothing.

'The important part of the shooting 
was to recreate the same light on the models and to ask them to pose in 
the same was as the statue they were representing. After that, it was 
possible to mix both pictures in post-production, using Photoshop to 
take the clothes from the studio shoot and put them on the pictures of 
the statues that I shot in the museum.'

In line with his childhood 
fascination with Einstein’s relativity research and study of 
environments and imagines with the idea that reality 'might not be as we
see it', Calliard changes the way we perceive these classic figures.

and neon shades while Michel de Montaigne by Jean-Baptist Stouf looks 
dapper in a blue plaid shirt and Ray-Ban sunglasses.

Aristaeus, God of the gardens by Artist François Joseph Bosio leans on a rock while appearing to wear a tight blue shirt with rolled up sleeves, rolled up trousers and trendy shades as Meleagre by Louis Simon Boizot is kitted out in rolled up orange shorts and a denim shirt.

The work forces the viewer to question what is real and what could be real.

Writing of his project, Callard says: 
'Who is to say that the figures presented in the stone of Greek Agora 
were not the greatest representation of the human form known at that 
time?

'The statues, with their clothes stripped away reveal a magnificence of shape & balance. But what were the Greeks wearing when they weren't posing for sculptors..?

'Appearance, in all its many nuances, present the character. 'Clothes maketh the man' as William Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet.

'One’s dress sense indicates one's priorities, choices, and lifestyle. Are you 'in' or are you 'out'?

'Hipster or Classic? Which tribe are you a member of? Which tribe were the men posing for these statues from?'

Hipsters In Stone presents a twist on themes taking the ultimate from the Classic world and adding a modern, contemporary twist with cropped trousers, Ray-Bans and plaid shirts - 'making the icons iconic'.

Calliard produces 30 x 45 inch prints of each statue mounted with plexiglass for £1,500 each. His work is exhibited now at the Art Basel fair in Switzerland.
