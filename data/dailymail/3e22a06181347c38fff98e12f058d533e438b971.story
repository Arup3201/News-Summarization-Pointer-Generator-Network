A would-be attacker was left battered and arrested after being beaten up when he tried to grab a 14-year-old female - who turned out to be a martial arts expert.

The 35-year-old man got more than he bargained for when he grabbed the young girl's arms as she walked home alone through a park near her home.

The young teen, who has studied self-defence and martial arts for some time, broke free from his hold and connected with several punches and kicks she threw at the man - who was more than twice her age.

The 14-year-old girl was grabbed in this scenic park by a man but luckily she was trained in martial arts and beat him off

Sussex Police are now appealing for any witnesses to the incident yesterday morning in Tilgate Park, Crawley.

A short time after the attack, police arrested a man on suspicion of assault.

The man, described by police as being 'very thin' and around 5ft 7in, was questioned then later released on bail until the end of the month.

Police have made an arrest but are still looking for anyone whoÂ was in Tilgate Park yesterday morning and saw what happened to the teenage girl

Detective Inspector Andy Bennett said: "Although we have made an arrest, we need to speak to anyone who was in Tilgate Park on Saturday morning and saw what happened.

"We need to find people who may have seen a man acting suspiciously in or around the park on Saturday or on other occasions.

"The teenager was badly shaken by what happened but was not injured.

"We do not know what the man's motive was but need to identify him to find out."
