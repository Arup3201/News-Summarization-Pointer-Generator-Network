Empty: Chris Evans may be forced to sell his historic pub to villagers who are angry it has been 'left to rot'

Chris Evans may be forced to sell his historic pub to villagers who are angry it has been ‘left to rot’.

The BBC’s One Show host and Radio 2 DJ closed down the 15th century Lickfold Inn gastro pub after it struggled to make a profit in 2010.

And after three years without finding a buyer, the Grade II-listed building has now fallen into disrepair – recently being flooded during the heavy rain.

But parishioners living in the West Sussex village have now had the building placed on the ‘community right to bid’ register meaning they have six weeks to raise the cash to buy it.

People living in Lickfold argued that apart from being an eyesore, they have no other meeting place and it has impacted on their social life as a community.

They are now looking for investors and the Mail understands one resident who lives nearby is interested in restoring it to run as a pub.

The inn, bought by Evans for £1 million in 2008, hosted his ex-wife Billie Piper’s wedding reception when she married Laurence Fox the previous year.

However, it now looks shabby with windows boarded up and a metal fence surrounding it. Local authority historic building inspectors found damage to the roof, grass growing out of the gutters and broken windows.

The professional kitchen is believed to have been removed shortly after it was closed down and the property has not been lived in since.

The pub has been on the market for as low as £825,000, but currently has a ‘to let’ sign hung on its wall. As the owner, Evans, 47, has a duty to repair the damages and maintain the building because of its listed status.

Lodsworth Parish Council chairman Caroline Neville said she was relieved the village now had a chance to re-open their pub.

The pub has been on the market for as low as £825,000, but currently has a 'to let' sign hung on its wall.

She added: ‘We’re desperately trying to get the money together now and find people who would like to help. It’s not been heated and with all the bad weather it’s been left to rot.

‘This latest ruling allowing us to be on the community right to bid register demonstrates actually how important the pub is to the community. The local people who live here really mean it when they say they want to buy it and this not just a game.’

Resident Maria Dimond said: ‘With all the recent bad weather and power cuts, it highlights that rural communities need a village focal point.

‘If Mr Evans lived in Lickfold, I feel sure he would be fighting with us to get the pub open again. The Lickfold Inn until relatively recently was a beautiful, very popular, historic English country pub, with a character and warmth that made you feel welcome. We and the local community would like it back!’

Evans blamed the effect of the credit crunch when he closed down the pub in 2010, confessing: ‘We have had some great times there but also some less good.’

His company Evans Pubs also owns the Mulberry Inn, Surrey, and the Newbridge Inn at Tredunnock, Monmouthshire.

Evans, who is worth £50million, lives in Berkshire, with his third wife Natasha Shishmanian, 34, sons Noah, four, and Eli, one. It was revealed his Radio 2 breakfast show pulled in a record 9.85million listeners during the last three months.

A Chichester District Council spokesman said: ‘A team including the council’s historic buildings advisor and an officer from the South Downs National Park recently visited The Lickfold Inn.

‘The council will continue to monitor the building and it will stay on our Heritage at Risk register at it is vacant and in a vulnerable location. Some small repairs to the windows, guttering and roof are to be carried out by the owner.’

A spokesman for Chris Evans declined to comment.
