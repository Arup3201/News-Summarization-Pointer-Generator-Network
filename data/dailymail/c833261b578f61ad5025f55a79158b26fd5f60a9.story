Britain was warned of floods and travel disruption as a 'conveyor belt' of Atlantic storm fronts soak the country for the next week - with 60mph gales hitting coasts with large waves.

The Met Office issued a severe weather warning in the South-East for surface water flooding from 30mm of rain - 10 days' worth - in six hours last night.

The Environment Agency warned of localised property, road and land flooding.

The biblical rain meant many sporting fixtures were played in testing conditions yesterday, including the international autumn rugby series and the first round of the FA Cup.

As further fronts sweep across some areas on Monday and then most parts of the UK on Tuesday and Thursday - with more rain following into the weekend - the Met Office warned of localised flooding and travel impacts, with 'saturated' south Wales and south-west Scotland most at risk.

Gales will accompany rain and are forecast to hit 60mph in the West, with strong winds for other parts.

Calum MacColl from the Met Office told MailOnline: 'There's a band of rain in place at the moment and we've got some heavy rain pushing through southern parts of England and so that's why we've got some yellow warnings in place.

'The rain will last until about 8am [on Sunday] morning, but behind that there are clear conditions coming from the west bringing lighter winds inland.

'In the south east it will be cloudy and there may be outbreaks of rain on Sunday which should clear by the early part of the afternoon and then we will see largely dry and bright weather.

'In general it is a pretty good day in central and eastern areas.' 

He added: 'Moving in to next week we will see some bright and sunny spells but it will continue to be unsettled, particularly from Tuesday. There will be heavy showers in southern coastal counties.

'Although there will be some brighter conditions there will be some heavy and thundery showers on Tuesday and Wednesday.'
