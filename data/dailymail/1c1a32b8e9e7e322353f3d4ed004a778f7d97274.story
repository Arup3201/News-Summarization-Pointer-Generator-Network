A woman has revealed how she had unprotected sex with notorious porn star James Deen after  responding to an open casting call on his website.

Jenn Tisdale, 33, a stand-up comedian and writer from Washington DC, who had no experience in the X-rated industry, filmed two scenes with Mr Deen one afternoon in a New York hotel room last month.

The pretty blonde told MailOnline that she got paid 'handsomely' for her stint in front of the camera, and there were no awkward moments as she writhed around completely naked in bed with her co-star.

Branching out: Jenn Tisdale, a stand-up comedian and writer from Washington DC, has told how she decided to make a sex tape with X-rated Lothario James Deen after he launched an 'open casting call' on his website

Indeed, she told XOJane.com that she felt so 
comfortable with lothario Mr Deen, that 'by the time we got down to the 
get-down, it was as if I slept with a pal.'

Despite the friendly ambiance, Ms Tisdale still managed to produce a convincing performance.

'I
 surprised myself by really going for it. I hardly noticed the 
larger-than-life camera, and I decided long ago never to bang in 
anyone's shadow. In other words, I gave it my all.'

She said afterwards she felt 'really good', 'empowered' and even started telling strangers about what she'd done.

'I went to the gym for obvious reasons, got a manicure/pedicure and showered and shaved everything'

'I ended up telling the woman at the Verizon store 
everything. She made me promise to come back and let her know when it 
was available because, and I quote: "My husband and I love watching porn."

'I filed her away as my first fan.'

As per the original agreement between Ms
 Tisdale and Mr Deen, an edited one-minute-six-second-long version of 
their sex tape was uploaded to jamesdeen.com last Friday.

Ms Tisdale told MailOnline that she responded to Mr Deen's advert because she wanted to know what shooting an adult film was like. While her boyfriend 
- who she is in an 'open relationship' with - was upset at first, she says he has since become her 'biggest supporter.'

Further explaining why she wanted to 'do a porno', she tells Mr Deen before they get to their bedroom scene: 'I was interested in the experience but only because it was with you.

Making it less awkward: Before shooting porn together Mr Deen (left) and Miss Tisdale (right) had exchanged emails and both knew what the other looked like

'It was just that you happened to put a cattle call out to the internet and I saw it.'

Indeed,
 27-year-old Mr Deen - whose real name is Bryan Matthew Sevilla - has 
attracted thousands of female followers thanks to his 'approachable' 
boy-next-door looks.

The California native's most famous 
co-stars to date include Teen Mom star, Farrah Abraham and Lindsay 
Lohan, who he 'slept with' in the non-pornographic 2013 movie, The 
Canyons.

Miss Tisdale told XOJane.com
 that when she first met up with Mr Deen - after being accepted to do a 
sex scene with him and getting her mother's approval - it felt like 'two
 people going on their first online date.'

'I surprised myself by really going for it. I hardly noticed the larger-than-life camera, and I decided long ago never to bang in anyone's shadow'

'We had exchanged a bunch of emails. We
 both knew what the other looked like. I was very comfortable,' she recalled

After
 taking a walk around New York, getting coffee and talking they decided 
to head back to the hotel room and get on with the task in hand.

To
 prepare for her unconventional screen debut, Miss Tisdale reveals in an
 essay for Brightest Young Things that she treated 'the whole affair as 
if I were going to prom.'

'I went to the gym for obvious reasons . . .  I got a manicure/pedicure. I showered and shaved everything.'

She also got tested for sexually transmitted diseases, a requirement before filming, as no protection was used. Mr Deen also produced his 'all-clear' results before undressing.

 action: Porn star Mr Deen is seen here in a behind the scenes snap, filming
 a love scene in bed with Lindsay Lohan on the set of the non-pornographic film The Canyons

As
 she sat waiting in the hotel room for Mr Deen to arrive, Miss Tisdale's
 nerves sky-rocketed as she thought more about what was going to happen.

Recalling
 her 'fidgety' demeanor, she wrote: 'Maybe I should put my laptop away. I
 don't want the whole world to see what my laptop looks like.

'It didn't occur to me that the whole world was about to see what my lap looked like, my naked lap.

'Porn is not the wizard behind the 
curtain it once was. Most of us have sex. A 
lot of us have used a camera. Some of us have put the two together'

'The room felt a little warm so I decided to adjust the temperature to, you guessed it, 69 degrees. JOKES.'

Then, she adds: 'There
 was a knock on the door and I opened it while brushing my teeth. I'm 
late to everything, including my own porn movie.'

After signing various release forms, Miss Tisdale filmed two scenes with Mr Deen.

While he has been criticized for drawing young girls into his 'seedy world' because his innocent looks, Miss Tisdale sees porn as something that should be embraced.

'Porn is not the wizard behind the 
curtain it once was,' she says.

'If you really break down the [concept] it's quite 
silly that anyone would react negatively to it.

'Most of us have sex. A 
lot of us have used a camera. Some of us have put the two together.'
