Hillary  Clinton used only a personal email address to conduct official government business during her four-year tenure as Secretary of State in a 'serious' breach of protocol, officials have said.

The 67-year-old former first lady  did not acquire nor use a government email account while serving in the position from January 2009 to February 2013, State Department officials said.

She also failed to preserve her  correspondence on the State Department's servers - something that is required of officials under the US Federal Records Act - until two months ago.

And even then, her aides allegedly decided which of her tens of thousands of personal emails  to hand over to the department in Washington D.C.'s Harry S. Truman Building for the public record.

They ultimately chose to release 55,000 pages of correspondence as she stepped down from the role in 2013, the New York Times reported.

'Unsecured emails': Hillary Clinton used only a personal email address to conduct government business during her four-year tenure as Secretary of State in a 'serious' breach of protocol, officials have claimed

On Monday, Jeb Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told DailyMail.com: 'Hillary Clinton should release her emails. Hopefully she hasn't already destroyed them. Governor Bush believes transparency is a critical part of public service and of governing.'

The Florida governor, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president in 2016, added on Twitter: 'Transparency matters. Unclassified @HillaryClinton emails should be released. You can see mine, here. http://jebbushemails.com.'

National Archives and Records Administration officials and government watchdogs have expressed concern over Mrs Clinton's 'extensive' use of a private account, deeming it 'insecure'.

On Monday, Jason R Baron, ex-director of litigation at NARA, told the newspaper that such a situation was 'inconceivable' - particularly in relation to a Secretary of State's correspondence.

'It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario - short of nuclear winter - where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level-head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business,' he said.

Mr Baron, now a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and Reath, added that although Mrs Clinton is not the first official to use a personal email address for business matters, her sole use of it is unusual.

Criticism: On Monday night, Florida Governor - and possible 2016 Republican presidential candidate - Jeb Bush called upon Clinton to release her emails, saying: 'Transparency matters'

'I can recall no instance... when a high-ranking official at an executive branch agency solely used a personal email account for the transaction of government business,' he told the newspaper.

Hillary Clinton's spokesperson Nick Merrill released a statement regarding the claims on Tuesday morning:

'Like Secretaries of State before her, she used her own email account when engaging with any Department officials. For government business, she emailed them on their Department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained. When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes.

Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved. As a result of State’s request for our help to make sure they in fact were, that is what happened here. As the Department stated, it is in the process of updating its record preservation policies to bring them in line with its retention responsibilities.'

Mrs Clinton may have violated federal requirements involving the State Department's retention of officials' correspondence by not preserving her correspondence on its servers, the Times reported. 

Her aides reportedly did not take any action to have her emails recorded - only unveiling them in January after officials launched a new initiative to comply with federal record-keeping practices.

'It’s a shame it didn’t take place automatically when she was secretary of state as it should have,' remarked Thomas S. Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive in Washington D.C. 

He added: 'Personal emails are not secure. Senior officials should not be using them.' 

Mrs Clinton's spokesman, Nick Merrill, has defended the likely Democratic presidential candidate's use of a personal email address, saying she had complied with the 'letter and spirit of the rules'.

Mr Merrill said that Mrs Clinton had expected her emails would be retained. But he declined to detail why she chose to conduct business from her personal account, instead of a government one.

Under federal law, emails sent and received by officials - such as the Secretary of State - are seen as government records. They are, therefore, required to be retained by the State Department.

Several exceptions to the law include sensitive or classified material. Between 2009 and 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration also required such correspondence to be preserved. 

According to the Times, most experts believe that private email accounts should only be used for official government business in emergencies, for both security and in the interest of the public. 

Indeed, since coming into office, current Secretary of State John Kerry, has used a government email account and continues to retain his correspondence on record, according to his aides.

It is unclear what security measures were in place on Mrs Clinton's personal account during her time as Secretary of State. It also unknown how many emails she exchanged while she was in office.

The former Secretary of State, who has a daughter, Chelsea, with husband Bill, is widely considered the front-runner for next year's Democratic presidential nomination if she decides to enter the race.

Mrs Clinton's spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment 

In a statement, State Department deputy spokesman, Marie Harf, told DailyMail.com: 'The State Department has long had access to a wide array of Secretary Clinton’s records - including emails between her and Department officials with state.gov accounts.

'Last year, the Department sent a letter to representatives of former secretaries of state requesting they submit any records in their possession for proper preservation as part of our effort to continually improve our records preservation and management.

'In response to our request, Secretary Clinton provided the Department with emails spanning her time at the Department. 

'After the State Department reviewed those emails, last month the State Department produced about 300 emails responsive to recent requests from the Select Committee.

'The Department is in the process of updating our records preservation policies to bring them in line with recent 2013 National Archives and Records Administration guidance.'

She added Mr Kerry is the first Secretary of State to 'rely primarily on a state.gov email account'.  

It comes as a family charity which was founded by Mr Clinton remains under scrutiny for accepting millions of dollars in donations from foreign countries while Mrs Clinton was at the State Department.

Two weeks ago, the Clinton Foundation admitted to violating an ethics agreement with the U.S. government while Clinton was in the president's cabinet. 

It had promised to stop cashing checks from foreign governments with which it had not previously done business. But in 2010 it took $500,000 in 2010 from Algeria - a country that was lobbying State at the same time - without asking the federal government for permission.
