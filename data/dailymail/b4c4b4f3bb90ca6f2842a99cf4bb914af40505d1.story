Tipping over into raging flood waters after a swollen river burst its banks it's a miracle that anyone on this packed Samoan bus made it out alive.

The screams of those on board can be heard as the bus arches into a ditch and becomes practically submerged in the river water in Savaii in Samoa.

Horrifying video footage has emerged of a terrifying bus crash that saw a 12-year-old and five-year-old killed earlier this month.

Horrific: The bus tried to negotiate a flooded road next to a raging river in Samoa when it flipped over and was swept away

Danger: The bus is unable to maintain its course and begins to lurch to the side of the road

Swept away: The bus is completely taken by the current and begins to topple over the edge of the road

Several other passengers were taken to a hospital on the island suffering from broken bones and other serious injuries.

The bus was travelling from Itu o Tane to the Salelologa wharf on the island to catch a ferry when the tragic accident happened.

All of the passengers - around 40 - were still inside when the bus overturned in flash flooding at Lano.

The bus flipped over as it dropped from the road to the river which normally passes underneath it.

According to Scott Maclaren, who 
filmed the clip, some were able to scramble to safety when the roof of 
the bus was ripped off but several others were dragged further into the 
water.

Terrifying: The bus is completely on its side as passengers scream in horror at their plight

Dragged out: The bus rolls away towards a huge stretch of open water with terrified passengers still trapped inside

Mr Maclaren said: 'The bus got about 
3/4 of the way across, but the current was too strong, and it slid 
towards the lower edge of the road. At this point people started 
screaming.

'There was a drop of about 1m from road to river, and as the bus went in it turned on its roof.

'At this point I put the camera down, 
covered up because of the rain, and started heading towards the seafront
where everything was being dragged to.

'The bus did another 90 degree roll so
the roof was now facing me, and the force of the water ripped the roof 
off, exposing the people inside like terrified sardines in a can.

Rescuers: Tourists and locals leapt into the water and attempted to save those onboard

'People
started jumping out left right and centre, the more able were able to 
scramble to the banks of the river, the less able were dragged out by 
the terrific current.

'I ran to the sea edge and waded in, looking for someone to help.'

Tourists and locals waded into the water and dragged people from the water.

In the wake of the accident, local police were reportedly investigating allegations that the bus driver had been drinking.
