Duke University says it has suspended a fraternity while police investigate allegations a woman was sexually assaulted at an off-campus party.

A statement from the university says Alpha Delta Phi has been suspended while Durham police investigate what happened at an off-campus house leased by fraternity members.

Durham Police Chief Jose Lopez told WRAL-TV that his department is seeking information from anyone at the January 8 party. No charges had been filed as of Tuesday afternoon.

Duke University says it has suspended a fraternity while police investigate allegations a woman was sexually assaulted at an off-campus party 

Local media outlets obtained a search warrant that says the woman told police she had drinks at the party before waking the next day dressed in a T-shirt that didn't belong to her.

She claims to have lost consciousness after drinking a hot chocolate. 

In the morning she is said to have received two text messages. The first simply said 'yo!', the second 'ha, ha, you went back with a kid I know... you're screwed', according to Jezebel.com.

The warrant says that the last thing the woman remembers is dancing with friends. Investigators took a mattress, comforter and condom from the house.

The private university in Durham, North Carolina, was founded by Methodists and Quakers. It has nearly 15,000 students, including about 6,500 undergraduates.

In 2006 a woman falsely accused three Duke lacrosse players of raping her. Crystal Mangum claimed Duke lacrosse players Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty and Dave Evans gang raped her at a team party where she was hired as a stripper.

The three men were arrested but eventually declared innocent by North Carolina's attorney general after the evidence failed to back up Magnum's inconsistent story and her mental stability was called into question.

Magnum was found guilty of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of her boyfriend in 2013. 

Last year eight college fraternities announced  an effort to work together on new training aimed at combating sexual misconduct, hazing and binge drinking.

The focus is on learning to recognize, diagnose and intervene in potentially harmful situations. 

An estimated 35,000 undergraduates are anticipated to participate in the first year of the Fraternal Health and Safety Initiative consortium.

The participating fraternities include Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Delta Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Chi, Tau Kappa Epsilon and Triangle — groups with a combined 75,000 undergraduate men at more than 550 college campuses. The consortium plans to use training that organizers say is based on research and created for retreat-like settings.

'If you think of the power of having all of these fraternities on a particular campus going through similar programming and similar messaging, it could definitely impact the culture on that campus fairly quickly,' said Marc Mores, executive vice president of the James R. Favor & Company, last September. The insurance company insures campus fraternities and organized the effort.

At around the same time the White House started the 'It's On Us' campaign, which is focused on encouraging people to consider stopping sexual assault to be part of their personal responsibility and to intervene when they suspect a potential victim can't or won't consent. 

A White House task force on campus sexual assault, in a report issued  in 2014, said that one of the most promising prevention strategies is bystander prevention.

Within higher education, there has been growing pressure to curb sexual assault and better protect victims.
