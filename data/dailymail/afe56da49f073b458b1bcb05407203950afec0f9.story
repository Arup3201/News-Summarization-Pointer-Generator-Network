In a flash: Two-year-old Marylou Rondeau (pictured) drowned in her backyard pool after being left alone for just a few minutes

A toddler drowned in a backyard pool 'so fast' after being left alone for just a few minutes, her distraught mother has revealed.

Two-year-old Marylou Rondeau fell into the water at her Quebec home after darting outside while her parents were inside the house.

She was found unconscious at the bottom of the above-ground pool moments later, but despite frantic attempts by the family to resuscitate her she later died.

Her mother, Julie Dufault, 27, hopes to warn other parents about the need to supervise children at all times around water.

'It really doesn't take a lot of time. Even if you go to the washroom, make sure [the pool] is secure and the door is locked.'

Dufault said her daughter was able to access the pool because their back patio door was broken.

'We were supposed to go get a new lock,' she told Radio-Canada.

'We always tell ourselves it will happen to others. This happened to us.'

Marylou died at her home in St-Remi, a small town in Montreal, at around noon on Thursday, one of two drownings involving toddlers that day.

Her parents performed CPR until 
paramedics arrived, but they were also unable to resuscitate her and the
youngster was later declared dead in hospital.

Dufault
now wants first aid training to be compulsory in Quebec and form part 
of all pre-natal classes offered at hospitals. The family is planning to
remove their pool.

A two-year-old boy also died in a backyard pool on Thursday after being found unconscious at his home in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines at around 5pm, it was reported on CBC News.

Police believe he slipped into the water when his parents weren't around.

Quebec has about 300,000 backyard pools, the highest number per capita in North America, according to the Royal Lifesaving Society.

Eight children have drowned in Quebec this year, six of them in backyard pools.
