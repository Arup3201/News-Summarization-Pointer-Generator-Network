Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone is to ask his team-mates to refund the money spent on tickets and travel by fans who saw their team’s capitulation against Southampton.

Some fans were in tears as Sunderland were humiliated 8-0 — one of the heaviest defeats in Barclays Premier League history.

Manager Gus Poyet claimed the defeat was his most embarrassing moment in football. The squad had the day off on Sunday with Poyet wanting to allow the dust to settle before addressing them.

Mannone's Sunderland side were thrashed 8-0 by Southampton on a miserable afternoon on the south coast

Santiago Vergini set the tone for the afternoon by smashing the ball into his own net with a comical own goal

When they meet for training on Monday, Mannone is intent on arranging compensation for fans who made the 650-mile round trip to St Mary’s.

‘I will talk to the team to see if it is possible to pay their tickets and their trip,’ Mannone said. ‘It is difficult for us but it’s very difficult for them as well.’

Three of Southampton’s goals were gifted by Sunderland. Liam Bridcutt and Santiago Vergini — with what will surely go down as own goal of the season — put the ball in their own net while Mannone’s poor clearance allowed Dusan Tadic to score past him.

‘After we conceded we threw in the towel and I include myself,’ admitted Mannone. ‘We lost 8-0 but we didn’t lose eight games 1-0. Let’s take it on the chin and go again.’ 

Ronald Koeman's Southampton side continued their impressive run with a dominant victory

The round trip from Sunderland to Southampton and back is 653.4 miles and would take 11 hours
