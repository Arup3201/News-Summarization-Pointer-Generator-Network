The judges: Twelve justices sit in The Supreme Court - 11 men and one woman which is a popular tourist attraction attracting 350,000 people since 2009

Jenny Rowe, the chief executive of the Supreme Court told The Times: 'The Supreme Court decides on serious points of law of considerable public importance, but we believe that offering a warm welcome to visitors and ensuring they are given assistance in understanding what happens here goes hand in hand with that core role.

'We are really pleased that so many tourists and other visitors have felt moved to leave constructive comments and give our team positive ratings.'

The building was built by Scottish architect James S Gibson with Skipwith and Gordon, and sculptures by Henry Fehr. 

It is situated opposite the Houses of Parliament and flanked by the Treasury and Westminster Abbey. 

Construction took place from 1906 to 1913, as one of a number of significant buildings constructed in the area at the early 1900s, including the Government Offices in Great George St (which is now HM Treasury), the Methodist Central Hall, the Head Quarters of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and the Institute of Civil Engineers.
