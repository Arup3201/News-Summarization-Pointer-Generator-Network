Japanese industrial designer Kenji Ekuan, whose works ranged from a bullet train to the red-capped Kikkoman soy sauce dispenser, has died, aged 85.

His office, GK Industrial Design Group, said Monday that Ekuan died of a heart problem at a Tokyo hospital early Saturday. 

A former monk, Ekuan crafted his iconic tabletop bottle, as familiar as the classic Coca-Cola bottle, for Kikkoman Corp. in 1961. 

He won international popularity both for the handy, flask-shaped dispenser and of course for the salty brown condiment that flavored many Asian cuisines.

Japanese industrial designer Kenji Ekuan, whose works ranged from a bullet train to the red-capped Kikkoman soy sauce dispenser, as familiar as the classic Coca-Cola bottle, has died of a heart problem at a Tokyo hospital early Saturday, aged 85

Ekuan, who is a former monk, crafted his iconic tabletop soy sauce bottle for Kikkoman Corp. in 1961. He went on to design the Komachi bullet train connecting Tokyo and northern Japan 

The Tokyo native has said he wanted to design a small bottle because of his childhood memory of his mother pouring soy sauce from a big half-gallon bottle to a tabletop dispenser.

His dispenser has been used ever since, according to the New York Times. More than 300million bottles have been sold worldwide.

Other of his renowned works include the Yamaha VMAX motorcycle, the Komachi bullet train connecting Tokyo and northern Japan, the Narita Express airport liner, as well as audio equipment and company logos.

His designs originate from the sights of Hiroshima’s devastation after the U.S. atomic bombing of the city 70 years ago.

He heard the voices of street cars, bicycles and other objects mangled and abandoned and wished they had been utilized more, he is quoted as saying in a company pamphlet for his Hiroshima exhibit last year.

His design principle was a ‘democratization’ of goods and beauty, to make them accessible for everyone. 

He wanted to become a maker of everyday things.

Before entering the design world, however, Ekuan became a monk at a Hiroshima temple to succeed his father, who died due to radiation from the atomic bombing.

But he eventually changed his path. He graduated from the prestigious Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1955 and went on to get a degree from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.

He founded his design studio in 1957, now called GK Design Group, which is made up of twelve firms - four of which are international - that provide product, transportation, environmental and communication design, according to Huffington Post. 

Last year, Ekuan received a prestigious Italian industrial design prize, the Golden Compass Award, after winning several other international awards.

When telling Japan Times about his designs in 2001, he said: 'Design to me has always meant making people happy. 

'Happy in the sense of creating items that provide comfort, convenience, function, aesthetics and ethics. 

'I used to do a lot of research, fieldwork, wanting to understand the psychology of human needs and response.’

He also designed Yamaha motorcycles, like the one pictured above. His design principle was a ‘democratization’ of goods and beauty, to make them accessible for everyone
