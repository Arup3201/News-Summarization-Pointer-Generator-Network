Heather Barnes, 20, a marine biologist student at the New College of Florida was swept out to sea Friday off the coast of Honduras.

Barnes was on a school trip and decided to do some early-morning coral collecting when her leg cramped and the tide pulled her away from the reef, starting a 16-hour nightmare that would leave Barnes hallucinating from dehydration with severe sunburns, jellyfish stings and blisters.

Miraculously, she made it back to shore alive - by herself.

Survivor: Barnes endured severe sunburns, jellyfish stings, blisters and hallucinations from dehydration during her 16 hours in open water

On Friday, the last day of the trip, Barnes couldn't sleep so she decided to do a little pre-dawn snorkeling to collect coral samples - as she had done every morning of the trip.

But while she was swimming alone in the 
coral reefs around Cayo Grande, she started cramping in her stomach and 
leg and was pushed out to sea by the ocean currents.

At first Barnes thought it would be safer to try and stay in the same place, thinking that her group would soon notice her missing and send search and rescue crews after her.

After two hours of idling and no sign of other life, she decided she would have to swim back herself.

'It's kind of strange because even when I didn't feel like I was strong enough, there was enough of me that still wanted to keep going. It didn't seem like a choice. I just - I had to keep going,' Barnes told ABC News.

And kept going she did. Sixteen hours after she first went out to snorkel, she made it back to land where locals found her and kayaked her back to the resort she was staying at.

It turns out that her group had noticed she was missing when she didn't turn up to breakfast at 7:30am.

Sandra Gilchrist, the professor supervising the trip, notified authorities and rescue boats were out in the water searching for Barnes twenty minutes later.

'I was furious with her when we realized she had gone out with herself. She knows better,' Gilchrist said. 'The search was immediately on.'

The rescue team grew to include 100 people by noon, including officials from two governments, coast guards, scuba divers, kayakers and locals on all the islands. But when no one spotted Barnes everyone grew to fear the worst.

When the locals brought back Barnes, her professor still couldn't believe her student was alive.

'My first reaction was I thought they were bringing back her body, because it was so long and it was dark. Then, one of my students came out and said, "She's alive! She's alive!"' Gilchrist said. 'Everyone broke out in tears and grabbed her.'

Gilchrist is going to make sure that an event like that never happens again under her watch. Next year she plans to make it mandatory for students to wear bright orange life vests when out snorkeling, and is even thinking about GPS devices that track the students in the water.

'Bottom line, though, don't go out by yourself,' she said.

It had been a long sixteen hours for Barnes. She endured severe sunburns, jellyfish stings, blisters, and hallucinations from dehydration, but is alive and recovering at her grandmother's house in Florida.

'I'm safe, well loved, and ready to take a break from the beach for a while,' Barnes wrote on Facebook.
