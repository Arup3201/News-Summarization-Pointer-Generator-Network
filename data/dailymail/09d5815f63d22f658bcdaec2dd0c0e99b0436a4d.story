ARCA driver Will Kimmel was uninjured after flying over a concrete retaining wall, flipping into a parking lot and striking at least one parked car at Mobile International Speedway.

The 26-year-old nephew of ARCA veteran Frank Kimmel posted on his Facebook page that he was 'doing good' following the bizarre crash early in the Mobile 200 on Saturday.

According to witnesses, it appeared the throttle stuck on Kimmel's No. 69 Ford on the ninth lap.

Death-defying: Kimmel was uninjured after flying over a concrete retaining wall, flipping into a parking lot and striking at least one parked car at Mobile International Speedway

Close encounter: The 26-year-old nephew posted on his Facebook page that he was 'doing good' following the bizarre crash. His vehicle is seen slamming into dirt

Survival: Will Kimmel (right) is seen posing with the man whose trailer hitch he struck, Jonny Charles Jr. 

Because there are no outside walls around the slightly banked track, there was nothing to stop Kimmel's car as it drove off the half-mile track.

Kimmel's car rolled at least once before finding the parking lot.

The car struck the trailer hitch of a pickup truck before coming to a stop. Kimmel posted a photograph he took with the truck driver to Facebook.

Kimmel said in an post-crash interview with Popular Speed's Matt Weaver 'Unfortunately for us the throttle hung, something we always check for, so it was just a freak accident.' 

Kimmel told Weaver 'I wish they would have [outside] walls here. Personally, just so I would have had to put a clip on it instead of junking a race car that I only had 12 laps on. I don't know. I'm frustrated.'

Mechanical problems: According to witnesses, it appeared the throttle stuck on Kimmel's No. 69 Ford on the ninth lap. This photo shows the trailer hitch Kimmel  struck 

Asked if he was alright, Kimmel said in the interview 'Yeah. I'm sore. I mean, I don't know who's not gonna be after that, but I don't have a headache or anything like that.'

Ron Drager, the president of ARCA Racing Series, told Popular Speed 'One of the things we do on a regular basis is understand the characteristics of a particular race track because you can’t apply what works at the Illinois State dirt Fairgrounds and apply it to Daytona or even Mobile.

'So understanding the nature of a facility with no concrete walls and understanding where the barriers are, we are certainly going to do a review of that.'

Drager told the website that the organization was happy both the driver safety compartment and Kimmel were unharmed.

Debris: Kimmel's car was left totaled after the race 

Wreckage: The car struck the trailer hitch of a pickup truck before coming to a stop
