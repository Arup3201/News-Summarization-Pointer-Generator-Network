Quality: Falcao has proved to be a formidable force for club and country

This isn't the first there has been interest from the Bernabeu as they looked to tie up a deal for the 28-year-old last summer from Atletico Madrid, before he opted for a move to France.

After missing the World Cup through injury, Falcao will be hoping to get himself back firing as soon as possible, but there will still be questions marks regarding his future, with Madrid not the only side to  express an interest in him.

Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United are all reportedly looking to tie up a deal for the frontman, however it could be champions Manchester City who may press for a deal more than anyone.
