Six-time Olympic gold medalist Amy Van Dyken Rouen has posted a photograph showing her smiling from her hospital bed just days after she severed her spine in an ATV accident.

'Doing great today,' the swimming champion wrote alongside the picture. 'My room is the most decorated in ICU. Thx for ur thoughts & prayers!'

In another image, she grins as medical staff help her sit up in a body brace, with the caption: 'Making progress. First day I sat up.'

Her husband, former Denver Broncos punter Tom Rouen, said in an earlier statement that the swimming champion is her 'typical spunky self' but is aware of the massive challenges she now faces.

The couple were driving back from dinner in Show Low, Arizona on Friday when Van Dyken's ATV hit a curb and threw her down an embankment, breaking a vertebrae and severing her spine.

Fighter: Olympic gold medalist Amy Van Dyken shared these images inside her hospital room on Tuesday, assuring fans she's 'doing great'. Her spine was severed in an ATV crash at the weekend

Still smiling: In another photograph on Tuesday, hospital staff help her sit for the first time since the accident

Rouen, who was on a motorbike, raced to reach her and lifted her head to help her breathe. He kept her stable until the helicopter 
arrived, he revealed in a letter than he released with her family.

A witness, who ran to her as she lay beside the ATV, said she was not wearing a helmet.

When help arrived, Van Dyken, 46, said she could not feel her legs and was airlifted to the intensive care unit at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn Medical Center.

'Amy 
awoke within hours of surgery acting like her typical spunky, 
boisterous, ebullient self and has spent the last 24 hours entertaining 
her family and her medical staff in the ICU,' said the letter, which was shared with Swimming World Magazine.

'She has made at least one 
male nurse blush. Amy's attitude has been overwhelmingly positive and 
optimistic. She has been far more of a comfort to us than we have been 
to her.'

Support: Van Dyken shared this image of relatives, including her brother, saying: 'I have the best family'

Loved: Beside this colorful painting shared on her Instagram page, she wrote: 'A drawing from my niece and nephew. They are so sweet. Made me smile. #hospitalsSuck'

The retired 
athlete's family said she had severed her spinal cord and that her broken 
vertebrae came within millimeters of rupturing her aorta.

Their letter continued: 'Amy has a long, trying road ahead of her, but as anyone 
who knows her can attest, her unparalleled mental strength and 
determination will propel her. She is a fighter.

Family statement

'Amy has overcome 
seemingly insurmountable obstacles before, winning 6 Olympic gold medals
 and becoming one of the greatest female athletes of her generation 
despite battling lifelong chronic asthma.

'Now this is her new challenge,
 her new battle. With the unconditional love and support of her friends,
 family and fans, Amy welcomes the challenges she will face as she opens
 this new chapter of her life.'Â 

Van Dyken showed this fighting, positive spirit with the photos she shared on Instagram.

'Never

 get us all together anymore,' she wrote beneath a picture of her 
relatives, including her brother David. 'This is amazing. I have the 
best family.'

Battle ahead: Tom Rouen has said his wife, Olympic gold medalist winner Amy Van Dyken is back to her usual 'spunky, boisterous, ebullient self' after waking up from surgery after severing her spine

'A drawing from my niece and nephew,' she wrote beside an image of a colorful drawing. 'They are so 
sweet. Made me smile. #hospitalsSuck.'

The couple is receiving a lot of support from family, friends and fans, Rouen told the Denver Post.

'It's rough,' he said. 'But Amy is aware of the challenges ahead of her. She is ready to meet them head-on.'

He told police officers that he had changed the throttle mechanism on the ATV from a thumb accelerator to a twist accelerator a few days before the accident - but he wasn't sure if it was a factor in the accident. He added that his wife had not been drinking alcohol during their dinner that evening.

In a statement to Swimming World Magazine, USA Swimming said they were 'devastated' to hear about her accident.

'We're happy to hear that she escaped and is now in great care,' the statement continued. 'That she is already 'acting like her typical spunky, boisterous, ebullient self' shows she's on a great path.

'Amy is a 
champion who has proven throughout her life that she is a fighter who 
takes on challenges and comes out on top. We know Amy will tackle her 
rehabilitation with vigor and be back on her feet sooner rather than 
later.'
