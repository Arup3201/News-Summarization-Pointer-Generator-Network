Tensions boiled over during Andy Murray's Australian Open semi-final victory against Tomas Berdych as the British No 1's fiancee appeared to fire an expletive-ridden blast towards his opponent.

After Murray won a gruelling baseline rally in the first set to claim a break back, Sears was caught on camera apparently mouthing 'F***** have that you Czech flash f***'.

It was just part of a series of heated moments during Murray's 6-7 (6-8), 6-0, 6-3, 7-5 win against Berdych on Thursday.

There were no microphones to pick up the 27-year-old’s exact choice of colourful words. But within moments of the uncharacteristic outburst being captured on film, thousands took to social media to comment on it, with some speculating that she had actually said: ‘Take that, you flash f***,’ or even: ‘F****** have it, you Czech f***.’

John Cassidy, a professional lip-reader, insisted that although Miss Sears’ mouth is partially obscured at the start of the utterance, he could ‘clearly’ see her saying: ‘You little f***.’

Asked about his girlfriend’s apparent cursing in the box Murray said: 'I was told about that. When there’s a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, then it’s completely normal that the whole first set everyone was tight. 

'My physical trainer, the physio, I’m sure for Dani it was uncomfortable, even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court. There was tension there for him as well. In the heat of the moment you say stuff that you regret.'

The build-up to the match had been dominated by talk of Murray going up against former coach Dani Vallverdu, who is now working with world No 7 Berdych, for the first time.

Both had tried to play down that particular dynamic but there was no doubt it added a fiery edge to the match.

Anyone thinking that all would be civil were surely thinking otherwise after Murray broke back for 4-5 in the first set.

After coming out on top in a long exchange, Murray turned in the direction of Vallverdu sitting in his opponent's box and let out a wild roar in celebration.

Berdych was clearly incensed, giving the Scot a long stare as both players walked back to their chairs.

As Murray sat down, he pumped his fist towards his own box, to which Sears responded with a fist pump of her own before clearly mouthing expletives as she glanced over towards Berdych's team.

Moments later, Berdych complained to umpire Pascal Maria about the quality of the tennis balls, to which Murray responded: 'He always does this.'

Berdych later explained what he said when the two passed at the changeover that seemed to rile Murray up: 'I really remember it well. I say to myself well done Tomas. That’s it. I think I’m allowed to do that when I win a set. What, I have to be worried about every word I am going to say? 

I just pumped myself up for winning the first set then sat on the chair. Maybe next time I should stay even more calm, and that’s it. It was a great battle a good match, unfortunately with a bad end for me.'

As Murray let out some expletives in annoyance at his own play, the big screens in Rod Laver Arena further added to the drama.

A 50-50 split screen was shown of Sears and Berdych's fiancee Ester Satorova. Sears appears to mouth: 'Oh for f*** sake.'

It then came to a head between Murray and Berdych after the latter claimed a 76-minute first set.

As he sat down in his chair, Murray complained to the umpire that Berdych had taken a dig at him as they walked past each other. 

He said: 'He's talking to me when we're passing.'

Berdych chipped in: 'Good play Tomas. That's all I said.'

Meanwhile, American television coverage further built up the battle of the WAGS. ESPN displayed another split screen of Sears and Satorova, this time with added captions at the bottom with the estimated worth of their rings and amount of carats in their engagement bands.

Murray quickly hit back on the court by taking the second set and then a break in the third had Berdych viciously hitting a ball high in the air which landed on the roof of the Rod Laver Arena.

The tension looked to have fizzled out when Murray went 2-1 up but not so as Berdych hit him in the leg with a volley and Murray muttered in frustration.

Murray went on to close out the match and clinch a place in the final and the handshake between the pair at the net after was surprisingly civil after all that had gone on before. 

Asked out about the tension afterward, Murray said: 'There was a little bet extra tension. It is a big match and a lot was made of Dani working with him. Me and Dani have been friends since I was 15 years old an I felt that was a little bit unnecessary. 

'This is sport and there's more to life than just sport. I thought it was maybe a little bit unfair and created a bit extra tension. But still it was there at the beginning but everyone calmed down at the start of the match.'
