Uber sneaky: The ride-sharing company Uber allegedly has been trying to undermine its rival Lyft by stealing away its drivers

The ride-sharing service Uber has been allegedly poaching drivers from its main rival Lyft with the help of 'brand ambassadors' armed with burner phones and credit cards, according to newly released documents.

Founded in San Francisco in 2009, Uber uses a mobile application to connect riders with vehicles for hire.

The start-up’s chief competitor, Lyft, came onto the scene in 2012, offering similar services via its peer-to-peer ride-sharing app.

On Tuesday, the technology website The Verge released an exclusive report outlining how Uber has been chipping away at Lyft’s market share through its so-called Operation SLOG, which so far has resulted in thousands of canceled rides for the two-year-old start-up.

According to the report, Uber has employed independent contractors dubbed 'brand ambassadors' to hire Lyft cars using disposable phones and company credit cards in order to recruit their rival's drivers.

Uber has vehemently denied trying to sabotage their chief competitor, which has been expanding its business nationwide.

'Lyft's claims against Uber are baseless and simply untrue,' the ride-sharing company told The Verge.

Uber also has denied claims made by Lyft that its employees have deliberately ordered and then canceled some 5,500 Lyft rides, costing the company’s staff both time and money.

But an unnamed contractor working for Uber told The Verge that his employers are 'flat-out lying' to their customers, the media and their investors about their concerted efforts aimed at disrupting their competitors in the cutthroat ride-sharing business.

Speaking to The Verge, the Uber employee laid out the company's secret strategy designed to poach drivers from its opponent.

According to the source, Uber's 'brand ambassadors' would order Lyft rides using Uber-supplied burner phones and credit cards, chat up the drivers and try to convince them to sign up with Uber before reaching their destination.

A brand ambassador could earn up to $750 for recruiting each new driver, the Uber contractor revealed to the technology website.

Ahead of Lyft's introduction of its ride-sharing service in New York last month, Uber went to work building 'street teams' made up of brand ambassadors who were given instructions to gather information about the completion’s plans and to siphon away its drivers.

An email sent by Uber managers to their independent contractors outlined the recruitment process, beginning with hiring a Lyft car using a burner iPhone.

The Uber agents posing as regular passengers were then supposed to engage the Lyft driver in small talk, asking him or her about their history with Lyft.

'After assessing driver for openness to Uber, ask them if they’d consider joining Uber,' the directive stated.

The brand ambassadors were coached to entice potential recruits with promises of higher trip volume, ‘more polished clientele,’ and newer vehicles.

The ideal outcome of the in-ride exchange was signing up the driver with Uber on the spot. 

In order to avoid redundancy and minimize the risk of being detected by Lyft, Uber created a private group on the messaging app GroupMe where brand ambassadors could share profiles of Lyft employees each of them had approached, The Verge reported. 

According to information obtained by the site, Operation SLOG has been put in place in at least 10 cities around the country, including Los Angeles, Miami and Boston.

Drivers are allowed to pick up passengers for both Uber and Lyft, but the practice is frowned upon by the companies.

The end justifies the means:  An Uber contractor revealed that the company has been using 'brand ambassadors' to hire Lyft cars in order to chat up the drivers and poach them away from the competitor 

Motorists who switch their allegiance from one ride-sharing business to the other are rewarded with perks and bonuses.

In response to the allegations detailed in The Verge piece, Uber posted a blog entry Tuesday downplaying the sabotage claims related to its driver-recruitment program called Operation SLOG, which stands for 'Supplying Long-Term Operations Growth.'

'There’s been a lot of discussion – and a lot of misinformation – about Uber’s driver recruitment and the ridesharing industry’s at large,' the post read. 'We’d like to set the record straight and demystify our recruiting efforts.'

Speaking to NBC News, an Uber spokesperson went to far as to call the claims in The Verge article ‘patently false,’ but acknowledged the existence of a systematic recruitment of Lyft drivers.

‘We can't successfully recruit drivers without talking to them, and that means taking a ride,’ the Uber representative said.

In its blog post, Uber described ride-sharing as a ‘noisy marketplace’ and suggested that its aggressive recruitment efforts are necessary to ‘cut through the noise to market to potential partners.’
