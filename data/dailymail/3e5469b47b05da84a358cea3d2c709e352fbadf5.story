A top state politician found himself in hot water this week after forwarding an email poking fun at First Lady Michelle Obama.

Republican Kansas House Speaker Mike O’Neal has been condemned for his 'disrespectful' and 'offensive' actions by rival Democrats.

The message referred to her as ‘Mrs YoMama’ and had a photo comparing Mrs Obama to the Grinch with a subject line of ‘Twins separated at birth?’

Blunder: Kansas House Speaker Mike O'Neal found himself in hot water this week for forward an email poking fun at First Lady Michelle Obama

Republican O’Neal has now apologised after the Lawrence Journal-World reported that he sent the email from his personal account.

The viral Grinch photo shows Mrs Obama’s hair being swept by the wind, recalling a Dr Seuss drawing from the classic Christmas cartoon.

In forwarding the email, Mr O’Neal joked that he had ‘had worse hair days.’

‘Cartoons are intended to be humorous,’ Mr O’Neal said in an apology. ‘This one made me laugh - I’ve had bad hair days too.

‘I forwarded it too quickly, missing the text included in the body of the email. To those I have offended, I am sorry. That was not at all my intent.’

This happened to be the second email Mr O’Neal sent from his personal account regarding President Barack Obama and his family.

Mr O’Neal recently sent along an email to House Republicans referring to President Obama with a Bible verse saying: ‘Let his days be few and brief.’

A spokesman said the email was referring to the President’s days in office.

The spokesman, Alyson Rodee, defended his forwarding of the second email, describing it as a ‘light-hearted political cartoon’.

'I’m sure you’ll join me in wishing Mrs YoMama a wonderful, long Hawaii Christmas vacation - at our expense, of course'

She said it also dealt with ‘extravagant spending of taxpayer funds’ by the First Lady when many Americans are struggling.

‘I’m sure you’ll join me in wishing Mrs YoMama a wonderful, long Hawaii Christmas vacation - at our expense, of course,’ the email says.

Mrs Obama and the President, a Democrat, spent the holidays in Hawaii, where he was born and mostly raised.

But Kansas Democratic party chair Joan 
Wagnon said the email demeaned the First Lady and the forwarding was 
‘highly offensive, disrespectful and unacceptable’.

‘Regardless of how he feels about President Obama’s politics, Speaker O’Neal’s decision to promote language demeaning Mrs Obama is simply wrong,’ she said.

The earlier email, also circulating on the Internet, refers to a bumper sticker that reads ‘Pray for Obama. Psalm 109:8.’

The verse says: ‘Let his days be few and brief; and let others step forward to replace him.’

The email said: ‘At last - I can honestly voice a Biblical prayer for our president! Look it up - it is word for word!

‘Let us all bow our heads and pray. Brothers and Sisters, can I get an AMEN? AMEN!!!!!!’
