CBS president and CEO Les Moonves wants to move the chains on brands' Super Bowl spending by upping the network's goal to over $5million for each 30-second spot.

Speaking on a conference call with analysts Thursday, Moonves first threw up a $6million price tag he expected for the 50th anniversary championship game taking place in 2016.

'Five to six million dollars for a 30-second spot sounds pretty good to me,' the New York Post reported Moonves as saying, though he later revised the number downwards.

Chief: CBS president and CEO Les Moonves wants to move the chains Super Bowl ads to between $5million and $6million per commercial slot

'We’re going to get north of $5 million for each Super Bowl ad,' he later said on the call.

Even a bump to $5million per ad would represent an increase of just over a 10 percent  on the price of an ad, as airtime for this year's Super Bowl  went for $4.5million.

Media research firm Kantar Media reports that the price of Super Bowl commercials has increased 75 percent over the past decade.

Not everyone agrees that stock in the NFL's marquee game is still ready to rise.

'The NFL marketplace was softer this year than in previous years,' one advertising agency executive told the Post. 'They’ve been struggling in the regular season, the playoffs and filling the Super Bowl.'

While the championship game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots had a record audience of 114.5million, some ad buyers had to be compensated for lower regular season numbers.

'So Les wants a 30 percent increase? It’s not happening,' says another ad executive of Moonves's upper estimates. 'They had to go to the second-tier guys to fill the Super Bowl.' 

'I’d be very, very surprised if they get anywhere near $6 million,' the exec said. 'But there’s always one sucker.'
