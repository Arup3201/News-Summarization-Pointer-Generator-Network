Adrien Broner has been suspended from boxing in a WBC-sanctioned fight over a racist slur after his victory against Carlos Molina.

The 24-year-old made the comment after securing a unanimous points win against the Mexican last Saturday at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

Broner and Molina were on the undercard to Floyd Mayweather's bout against Marcos Maidana.

Ban: Broner has been suspended from boxing over a racist slur after his victory over Carlos Molina

Down he goes: Broner won on a unanimous points decision after the 10-round bout in Las Vegas

'I just beat the [expletive] out of a Mexican,' he roared after the 10-round win.

The World Boxing Council took an extremely dim view of the language used and suspended Broner until they and Molina are issued an apology.

A statement from the WBC read: 'The World Boxing Council holds human equality as its banner and will not accept a former WBC champion to make racially offensive statements.

'Since words have different meanings and can be interpreted in different ways , the WBC is issuing this open letter to Adrien Broner to either clarify what he meant with his words or to issue a public apology if those words were intended to be despective and offensive.

'Adrien Broner is hereby suspended from participating in any WBC sanctioned Championship and will be excluded from the WBC Ratings until the time he makes a public apology satisfactorily to the public of the world.'

Say sorry: The World Boxing Council are demanding that the American apologises for his comments
