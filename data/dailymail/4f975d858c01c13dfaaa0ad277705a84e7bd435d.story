It boasts huge warehouses around the globe, stocking everything from bikes to books.

And now Amazon is branching into the fine art arena - and selling off original and limited edition works.

Customers can buy works of art from more than 150 prominent galleries and dealers via Amazon Art.

Amazon Art is now selling works by Norman Rockwell, along with a host of other well-known artists

Warhol's prints of Chairman Mao are all for sale on the marketplace - and shoppers can pick up a piece of art along with books, music and cookware

Amazon Art features 40,000 works from more than 4,500 artists, with prices ranging from $10 (£6.45) for a screen print to a Norman Rockwell oil painting that costs $4.85 million (£3.1 million).

Andy Warhol's screen prints of Mao, the late Chinese Communist dictator, are on sale for $200,000 (£128,949).

The wide range of works includes folk art, impressionism and modern art, and potential buyers can search through mediums, prices, subject and style.

The online marketplace offers detailed information about the artist, work, provenance and exhibition history.

Traditionally, works like Norman Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties and Andy Warhol's portraits would be auctioned off - but now Amazon hopes to bring buyers to its website and change the way art is sold

While many galleries and artists will undoubtedly welcome the prominence the website will bring to them, some feel that online market place's new venture cheapens the art and compromises its integrity.

Georgina Adam of the Financial Times and the Art Newspaper said: 'It's demeaning for a high end artist and also for those at the lower end,' the BBC reported.

'A unique piece of art is more than just a product. It is a unique creation.

'I think the way it is sold in the Amazon way devalues it.'

Despite the critics, the site is sure to get a lot of attention from budding art collectors, as around 80 million visitors look at the marketplace every month, it was reported in December.

The announcement came on Tuesday, a day after Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc. announced that its CEO, Jeff Bezos, had purchased The Washington Post.

Amazon worked with Sotheby's for a short-lived experiment selling art online in 1999, but then the venture was shut down after 18 months to make way for Sothebys.com.

Amazon, which initially sold just books online, was originally founded in Bezos' garage in Bellevue, Washington in 1995.

The founder resolved to take full advantage of the internet and begin a dot com company.

His gamble paid off - within the first two months of business, Amazon sold to over 45 countries and is now the biggest online retailer in the world.
