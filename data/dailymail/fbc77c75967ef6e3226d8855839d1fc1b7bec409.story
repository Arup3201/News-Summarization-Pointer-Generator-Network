Critical: Aimee Copeland is battling for life in intensive care after contracting a flesh-eating bug

24-year-old Aimee Copeland, who had her leg amputated after an aggressive flesh-eating bug infected a wound, is likely to lose more limbs.

Her father, Andy, said that while his daughter is showing signs of improvement, doctors might be forced to amputate her hands and right foot.

'Her fingers basically appear mummified,' said Mr Copeland at a press conference with his wife Donna and daughter Paige, 25, reports AJC.com.

However, the family remain optimistic, as a neurologist and cardiopulmonologist have said there is no brain damage or irreversible injury to the lungs, which were under attack.

Previously they had stated her chances of survival were 'slim to none'.

Mr Copeland describes his daughter as 'outdoorsy' and a 'lover of people' and hopes that she will eventually finish her master's degree.

'What we've got is nothing short of a miracle. My baby is alive and her mind is good. I know we have a difficult road ahead, but right now we're rejoicing,' he said.

Aimee's mother is more cautious about her daughter's future.

'We want to think that way, but it can just change,' she said. 'It's like a rollercoaster every day.'

Miss Copeland was kayaking along the Little Tallapoosa River in Carrollton, Georgia, when she stopped to ride a home-made zipline. The line snapped, and she suffered a gash to her left calf, which required two dozen staples to close.

After initially being turned away several times from medics with nothing more than pain killers and antibiotics, horrified doctors realised an aggressive flesh-eating bacteria - aeromonas hydrophila - had invaded the increasingly agonising wound.

Medics were forced to amputate the young woman's leg on Friday night, and she remains in a critical condition at the JMS Burn Center in Augusta.

Andy Copeland told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that
his daughter, who is a graduate psychology student at the University of
West Georgia, attended the emergency room at Tanner Medical Center in 
Carrollton after cutting her leg.

Doctors there closed the wound with 22 staples, and told her to take Motrin and Tylenol for the pain.

The next day, she returned complaining of severe pain and was given a prescription for painkillers.

Her father said this alleviated her symptoms, but the pain continued to build on Thursday.

'Aimee
went to the doctor and received a prescription for antibiotics and 
posted a clean MRI report,' he said. 'Again, she was treated and 
released.'

On 
Friday morning the student was driven to the emergency room by a 
concerned friend. Pale and weak, she received a shocking diagnosis: She 
was suffering from necrotizing fasciitis, a rare flesh-eating bacteria 
that can destroy skin, fat and muscle.

Physicians
told the young woman the infection had already spread to her thigh and 
hip, and that her whole leg would have to be amputated.

Miss
Copeland was flown to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, where
doctors performed a high-hip amputation of her left leg and removed 
further infected tissue from her abdomen.

'The
surgeons advised me that they wanted to try to save her leg, but at 
this point saving her life took precedence,' Mr Copeland said on 
Facebook.

'They removed all of the infected tissue and advised that she would have limited, if any use of her leg.'

'Aimee
[cardiac] arrested when they moved her from the operating table, but 
they were able to successfully resuscitate her,' he added.

Writing on Facebook on 6 May, he 
concluded: 'I type this factual progression of Aimee’s condition as a 
way to better cope with what is without a doubt the most horrific 
situation that a parent can possibly imagine.

'We take so much for granted in life,
but I never imagined that one of my daughters would face this most 
unlikely of situations.

'I
hope and pray that when you read this that the news we receive at 
sunrise will be positive. At this point, no news is good news, but all I
know to do is hope and pray for the best. I only ask that you all do 
the same.'

Friends and co-workers from the Sunnyside Cafe in Carrollton, where Miss Copeland works, have banded together to support her family. 

WSBTV quoted a friend, Kara Dermo, who said, 'She was awesome, just great ... just really awesome to be around.'

Miss Copeland is well-known in Carrollton, where she had organised festivals and activities.

Sunnyside cafe owner Gary Duke said: 'She planned to go to work helping troubled youth. Then all the sudden, this devastating accident.'

A website for psychology students at the University of West Virginia said of the brave young woman:

'About Aimee: Bright star, lover of life, infinitely generous of heart and spirit. From Snellville, GA. B.A. from UGA in 2010. Nearing completion of her Master’s degree at UWG Psychology. Loved dearly by family and friends.'

Miss Copeland's friends have established Aimee's Fund at the United Community Bank in Carrollton, with the aim of raising money for her rehabilitation. Details are available on the student page dedicated to Miss Copeland. 

They also plan to hold a blood drive in the university's gym from 2 to 7pm on May 15.

Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection.

'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat.

The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea.

Organ failure and shock are also common complications.

Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue.    

Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.
