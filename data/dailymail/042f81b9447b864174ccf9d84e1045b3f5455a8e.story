Authorities have released an age progression photo of a young boy on the anniversary of his disappearance, eight years ago.

Trenton Duckett was just two-years-old when he mysteriously vanished from his home in Leesburg, Florida.

His mother, Melinda Duckett, reported on August 27, 2006, that intruders had broken into the family's home by cutting through a screen window while her husband was away, and she never saw her son again.

Just two weeks after her son's disappearance, tragedy struck the family again. 

Melinda agreed to a televised interview with Nancy Grace and, after coming under scrutiny and being slammed by the former prosecutor for her lack of information and specifics about her son's disappearance, she killed herself the next day.

In her suicide note, the 21-year-old mother wrote, 'I love [Trenton] and only wanted him safe in my arms. You created rumors and twisted words. Usually I am strong and what others say does not affect me. However I am young.' 

'Nancy Grace and the others, they just bashed her to the end,' Melinda's grandfather Bill Eubanks said at the time.

'She wasn't one anyone ever would have thought of to do something like this. She and that baby just loved each other, couldn't get away from each other. She wouldn't hurt a bug.' 

Melinda's family and estate later brought a lawsuit against Grace, and CNN, for inflicting emotional distress on Duckett with her interrogation about the missing boy. 

The suit was eventually settled and required Miss Grace to establish a $200,000 trust dedicated to finding Trenton.

If Trenton is not found alive by his 13th birthday, money in that trust will be transferred to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 

According to the Daily News, friends and family plan to hold a vigil for Trenton tonight in Lake County. 

They are hoping this new photo, which depicts what Trenton might look like as a nine-year-old, may turn up some new leads of information about his disappearance.

If you have any information about Trenton's disappearance, please contact the Leesburg Police Department.
