As Christians around the world prepare to mark the birth of Jesus by celebrating Christmas, a former Archbishop of Canterbury has warned that the religion is being increasingly marginalised in Britain.

George Carey says that Christians are pressured to hide their faith at work, with many religious people cowed into 'increasing timidity' by society's secular leanings.

He also spoke out about the plight of minority Christian populations in the Middle East and elsewhere who are being oppressed by governments and their fellow countrymen.

Speaking out: George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, says that many Christians in Britain feel under pressure to hide their religious faith

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Carey said: 'I am worried about the future of faith in the West. Many Christians I meet say there is a pressure on them to be silent about their faith.

'Though there can be no question of a comparison with the powerlessness and weakness of the Church in the Middle East, there is an increasing timidity on the part of churchgoers in the West - about even admitting that they have a faith in the workplace.'

The issue of Christians' religious freedom in the workplace has repeatedly appeared in the headlines over the past few years.

Warning: Prince Charles has spoken of his concerns about the oppression of Christians in the Middle East

In January, a BA employee who was banned from wearing a cross at work won a â‚¬2,000 payout after a court determined that her religious rights had been breached.

But this month, a care home worker who sued her employer for making her work on a Sunday lost her case for unfair dismissal.

Lord Carey, who served as Archbishop of Canterbury from 1991 to 2002, has previously spoken of his worries about the future of the Church of England.

Last month he told the General Synod: 'We are one generation away from extinction - if we do not invest in young people there is going to be no one in the future.'

In his Christmas message in the Telegraph, the former Archbishop also drew attention to Prince Charles's concerns about the future of ancient Christian communities in the Middle East.

Christians in countries such as Egypt and Palestine, where the faith has been established longer than anywhere else, are under threat from the hostility of governments and majority Muslim populations.

'Successive governments have done little to speak up for Christians facing human rights abuses in Africa and the Middle East,' Lord Carey wrote.

'In fact this Government, which has conspicuously sought friendly and co-operative relationships with the churches, is doing just as much to wash its hands of persecuted Christian communities as any of its predecessors.'

Concerns: Lord Carey said that many people are complacent about Christianity's place in society

He suggested that many people overlook the plight of Christians because the religion is considered to be comparatively powerful thanks to its historical dominance in the West.

'Far from being important and influential, in many parts of the world Christianity is weak and despised, and Christians are attacked and killed,' Lord Carey wrote.

'In Nigeria, churches are firebombed; in Pakistan, churchgoers are prosecuted under draconian blasphemy laws, while in Egypt, they are either marginalised or assaulted.'
