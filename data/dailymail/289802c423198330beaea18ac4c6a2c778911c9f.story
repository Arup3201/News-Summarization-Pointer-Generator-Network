Manchester United defender Phil Jones has turned to yoga and pilates in a bid to overcome the injury problems that have blighted his early years at Old Trafford.

The England international made his latest comeback for Louis van Gaal’s team in the 3-0 Barclays Premier League win over rivals Liverpool at the weekend.

Jones was rushed back ahead of schedule but came through unscathed and last night revealed he has turned to some of the game’s more modern conditioning methods as he bids to maintain fitness.

‘I started the pre-season and played every single game and every single training session,’ he said. ‘Then, on international duty, I pulled my hamstring and I have never had a muscle injury so it was disappointing.

‘When I was coming back I then had shin splints. It has been unfortunate. I have been doing a lot of work in the gym and hopefully that will stand me in good stead for the rest of the season.

‘It is strength work, yoga and pilates and loads of stuff. I will do anything I can to improve myself. People don’t wake up one morning and say, “I fancy being injured today’’. It is just the way it is.

‘My aim right now is to stay fit and stay focused and get a run of games under my belt.’

If Jones sounds defensive about his injury record then it is perhaps understandable. Since signing from Blackburn, the 22-year-old has made a relatively modest 69 league starts in three-and-a-half seasons and has suffered more than a dozen injuries.

On Sunday against Liverpool, however, he produced a performance fundamental to United’s victory.

‘The first 20 minutes were a bit of a whirlwind for me to be honest,’ he said. ‘But it was great to be back out there.

‘We know that we are not firing on all cylinders yet but we are learning and we will keep improving.’

Midfielder Ander Herrera declared his innocence int he face of match-fixing allegations

The allegations date back to the midfelder's time in Spain with Athletic Bilbao

Meanwhile, United midfielder Ander Herrera has declared his innocence in the face of allegations of match-fixing in Spain.

Herrera and Swansea midfielder Jefferson Montero are among 41 players, coaches and directors named in an investigation.

Prosecutors allege almost one million euros was used to pay Levante players to lose their match against Zaragoza at the end of the 2010-11 season.

In a statement on his Facebook page, Herrera said: ‘I have never had and will never have anything to do with manipulating match results. If I am ever called to testify in any judicial hearing I’ll be happy to attend as my conscience is totally clear.’
