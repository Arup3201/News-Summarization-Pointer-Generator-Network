Plea: Chief Constable Justine Curran, 46, claims police should be exempt from rules that bar parents from term time holidays as officers have to work during summer and Christmas

A police chief has called on schools to give officers' children special holiday allowance during term time.

Chief Constable Justine Curran, 46, said headteachers should 'fully consider' requests from police because they are busy in the summer and at Christmas.

The plea comes despite a clampdown banning parents from term time holidays except under 'exceptional circumstances'.

If parents in England and Wales fail 
to ensure their children attend school, they may be issued with penalty 
notices of £50 to £100.

Prosecution can result in a fine of up to 
£2,500, a jail sentence of up to three months or a community sentence.

However, in a letter to every headteacher in her area, Humberside Police chief Ms Curran said that police officers deserve to be exempt from the rules as their holiday period is 'restricted' to term times.

She claims due to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Nato summit in south Wales, officers will be deprived of normal holiday leave.

'I respectfully ask therefore that any applications for term time absence are fully considered,' she added.

The suggestion has sparked outrage, with critics claiming the police force is just one of many industries that has high-time at summer and Christmas.

John Killeen, a representative of the
 National Association of Head Teachers union, said there was 
'inflexibility in a lot of professions'.

He added: 
'We have sympathy with the police service but it would make the head 
teacher's position untenable with the rest if the parent body if they 
started making exceptions.'

Defending Ms Curran, Paul Yeomans chairman of the Humberside Police Federation said his members deserve special treatment.

'They're not able to take their leave during the peak times and it is not their fault,' he said.

Yesterday figures revealed more than one 
in three parents are still taking their children on holiday during term 
time as they cannot afford summer rates.

Justine Curran, from Sheffield, rocketed up the ranks within the space of a few years.

She entered the force as a graduate, starting as a Constable in Wigan in 1989.

In 1991, she was promoted to Sergeant of Greater Manchester Police, to Inspector in 1995, then to Chief Inspector in 1998.

After a brief move to become Superintendent at Merseyside Police, Ms Curran returned to Manchester in 2003 to be Chief Superintendent and Divisional Commander for North Manchester Division.

In the years that followed, she headed the region's Counter Terrorism Unit and controlled a £560 million budget, earning the accolade of Gold Advanced Public Order Commander.

In 2010, she became the first female Chief Constable of Tayside Police in Dundee, praised with bringing a 'corporate edge' to the force.

After moving to Humberside in April 2013, she was awarded the Queen's Police Medal for her work.

At the same time, one in five of these
 parents are fabricating emergencies to hide what they are doing - 
putting their child's absence down to an invented illness.

The
 research by Nationwide building society also found the average family 
break in Spain rockets up by £1,347 once term time ends.

This compares to the current penalty of £60 for an unauthorised absence which can be increased to £2,500 if the case ends up in the courts.

Yesterday, a couple in Coventry were handed criminal records and a £800 fine after taking a 13-day holiday in Australia to visit relatives as the children's grandmother was terminally ill.

The tough line on punishing parents who take children out of school has been championed by the Education Secretary, Michael Gove, who said they could not afford to miss lessons if they were to achieve the results expected.

He has turned the screw on parents and schools by ending a policy that allowed schools to grant up to 10 days holiday a year to families in ‘special circumstances’.

The policy has caused enormous anger among parents, while a London banker has recently lodged a legal test case to challenge the law.

James Haymore was summonsed to court after he refused to pay a £120 fine for taking his children to America for six days at the start of the spring term for a memorial service for their great-grandfather.

Mr Haymore, who works for JP Morgan, will argue that the decision to prosecute him for taking his three children out of school is a breach of the Human Rights Act.

A spokesman for the Nationwide said: ‘Given the fact that the premium for a typical holiday in Spain for a family of four could be as much as £1,347 more during school holidays compared with term-time, it’s no wonder that parents are still tempted to face the ire of their children’s head teacher, plus the threat of a fine, in order to save some significant cash.’

It looked at the cost of a holiday for a family of four with two children aged seven and nine for the first week in July, which is in term time, versus the first week in August.

The cost of the same one week holiday in Spain rose from £1,508 to £2,855, which is an increase of £1,347. The price of a holiday at CenterParc in Wiltshire rose by £860 to £2,448, while the figure for Disneyland Paris went up by £369 to £2,827.

Football fan: Ed McGovern, headteacher at Stafford Leys Primary School, took two weeks off work during term time to travel to Brazil

A primary school head teacher sparked outrage last month after it emerged he had taken two weeks off during term time to travel to the World Cup in Brazil.

Ed McGovern, 55, was allowed to take unpaid leave from Stafford Leys Primary School in Leicester due to 'personal reasons' after enlisting the help of his union.

The school did not confirm the reason for Mr McGovern's absence but parents said they found out he had gone to South America for the World Cup.

A spokesman for the school said Mr McGovern has never previously made a request for leave of absence and his attendance record has been 'exemplary.'

But furious parents said he should be 'setting an example', especially when they could be fined for taking their children out of school.

One even called on the head teacher to resign.

Businesswoman Carol-Anne Girvan, 42, whose two sons attend Stafford Leys Primary School, said: 'I think it's absolutely appalling.

'He is headteacher, he was refused permission to do this at first and had to appeal to his union I hear.

'He has a responsibility here for his pupils and he has neglected them.

'He is supposed to be setting an example to not only the students but for parents, who themselves cannot go to this kind of event. He ought to resign because of this.'

Parent Kiran Kaur added: 'I don't think it is right. We parents can't do it, can we, but he can go away when he wants. I think Ofsted should be taking a good look again at the school - his leadership should be in serious question now.

'I want to know why the governors and powers that be thought that this would be OK.'

It came after a headteacher in Leicester took a month off school during term time to get married.

From the day her pupils returned to school after Easter, Vina Pankhania enjoyed nearly a month off – and came back just before school broke up again for summer half-term.

Miss Pankhania was given permission to take a month off by governors ‘because she has worked extremely hard’.

The 30-year-old, who writes of the ‘importance of respect, good manners’ and ‘high standards’ on the school’s website, went on leave from April 28 – the first day back at school after Easter.

She returned to work on May 23, three days before the summer half-term holiday starts.

Parents reacted with fury when they received a letter from governors telling them about her plans.

One, Sonya Gilmour, said: ‘As a parent of two boys at Little Hill, I find this disgusting. How can governors approve leave just after Easter when parents themselves can be fined for similar actions?

'Surely the summer time off she has is big enough to accommodate a wedding.’

Miss Pankhania refused to comment.
