Disney and Harrods today announced they are to auction ten exclusive Disney Princess-inspired dresses, stunningly handcrafted by the world's leading fashion designers, including Oscar de la Renta, Versace and Elie Saab.

The gowns will go under the hammer at Christie's in November to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity.

Showcased this weekend at Disney’s D23 Expo in Los Angeles, USA, the bespoke pieces are expected to generate major interest from collectors across the globe when they are sold later in the year.

The fairytale frocks were created in a collaboration between Harrods, one of the world’s most famous department stores, and Disney.

Unique designer dresses inspired by Disney's iconic princesses are to go under the hammer in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital

Each dress is an individual interpretation of a Disney Princess, paying tribute to the stories of Ariel, Aurora (Sleeping Beauty), Belle, Cinderella, Jasmine, Mulan, Pocahontas, Rapunzel, Snow White and Tiana. 

The unique collection of dresses was first showcased in the Harrods' Christmas 2012 window displays.

Matthew Grossman, Vice President of Corporate Citizenship, The Walt Disney Company EMEA, said: 'The timeless stories of our Disney Princesses continue to be enjoyed by families around the world, so it has been fantastic to see their individual qualities celebrated by globally renowned designers.

'We are delighted that Disney enthusiasts and fashion fans will now have the chance to own a piece of the magic with this once-in-a-lifetime auction whilst also helping us to raise vital funds for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity which we’ve been supporting for many years.'

Mark Briggs, Store Image Director at Harrods, said: 'These exquisite dresses are really one-of-a-kind fashion items from some of the most celebrated and collected designers this century.

'They caused a huge amount of excitement when they were first showcased in the Harrods windows and we’re sure fashion aficionados around the world will be thrilled with the opportunity to own something so utterly unique.'

Clare Borthwick, Vintage Couture Specialist at Christie’s, said: 'We are really looking forward to auctioning these inspirational pieces that embody both high-end fashion and childhood nostalgia.

Princess Jasmine by Escada: The heroine of Walt Disney Pictures' 31st animated feature film Aladdin (1992), was based on the character Princess Badroulbadour from the Middle Eastern folk tale Aladdin, part of the One Thousand and One Nights series

Snow White by Oscar de la Renta: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), the studio's first animated feature, is loosely based on the German fairy tale of the same name by the Brothers Grimm

Belle by Valentino: Based on the heroine of the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, Belle was developed by Woolverton into a stronger character for the 1991 Disney film adaptation

Pocahontas: The title character in Disney's 33rd film is very loosely based on the historical figure Pocahontas, a Virginia Indian notable for her association with the colonial settlement at Jamestown, Virginia

Princess Aurora by Elie Saab: The heroine of Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty was based on the French version of the tale by Charles Perrault, written in 1634

Cinderella by Versace: The main character in Walt Disney Pictures' twelfth animated feature film Cinderella (1950), is also based on a heroine of a French fairy tale by Charles Perrault

'They will be a fantastic addition to
our annual Vintage Couture sale, which is taking place on the 13 
November 2013. The rarity of these items mixed with the global appeal of
Disney Princesses will make these extremely sought after, and we expect
much interest from around the world.'

All proceeds raised will go towards Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity.

Disney has supported the hospital for many years, with Walt Disney first visiting the hospital in 1951.

The
partnership was formalised in early 2008 with a commitment to raise £10
million towards the hospital’s redevelopment. As well as offering support through fund-raising, the company has also
been offering unique Disney experiences to the hospital's patients and 
their families.

Potential buyers can register their interest in advance by emailing princess.dresses@disney.co.uk.

Tiana by Ralph & Russo: The Princess And The Frog was the 49th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The film is loosely based on the novel The Frog Princess by E. D. Baker

Ariel by Marchesa: Walt Disney Pictures' 28th animated film, The Little Mermaid (1989), is based on Hans Christian Andersen's story of the same name

Rapunzel by Jenny Packham: The long-haired heroine is the star of Tangled, a 2010 American computer-animated film and the 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney series. It is loosely based on the German fairy tale Rapunzel

Mulan Missoni: Produced in 1998, the film is set in China during the Han Dynasty. Fa Mulan impersonates a man and takes her father's place during a general conscription. It grossed £196m, earning Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations
