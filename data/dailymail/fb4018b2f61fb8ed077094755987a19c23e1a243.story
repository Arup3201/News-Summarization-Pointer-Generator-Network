Fewer than one in five teenagers has a part-time work while they study, heralding the death of the Saturday job.

New figures reveal that among 16-18-year-olds just 19.4 per cent of students are also earning money, falling to 14.2 per cent among 18-year-olds.

MPs and employers warn thousands of youngsters are missing out on the ‘rite of passage’ in holding job like delivering newspapers or shelf-stacking, leaving them ill-prepared for the world of work.

New figures from the Department for Education show how the proportion of teenagers in full-time education who also have a job has fallen sharply in the last decade

Tory MP Damian Hinds, who obtained the figures, said having a Saturday job was a 'rite of passage' for young people to experience the world of work

The economic crash has meant fewer part-time jobs are available for students while increasing numbers of exams mean many feel under pressure to study not work.

There are also claims that paper boys and girls have been replaced with ‘more reliable’ adults who are considered less likely to turn up late or quit without warning.

From 2001-2004 the number of young 16-18-year-olds with a part-time job was relatively stable at around 475,000.

But by 2011 the figure had slumped to 370,000, a drop of more than 20 per cent.

In 2002, almost one in three 16-year-olds had a part-time job but a decade later the figure was just over one in six.

Tory MP Damian Hinds said young people who did not experience the world of work in a part-time job were missing out.

‘One of the ways you learn the knocks of life is through work,’ he told MailOnline.

‘If there are fewer young people doing Saturday jobs and paper rounds you are that much less likely to get used to having a bad boss and all the things which are like a rite of passage.’

Mr Hinds, who obtained the figures through parliamentary questions, said there were several reasons for the fall.

‘Fewer people now get papers delivered, people don’t have their milk delivered and so on.

‘There
 is also something about how hard kids work these days and how much more
 they are examined. They are doing more subjects in the lower sixth and 
have more exams and they do feel the pressure of academic achievement.

In some areas paperboys are being replaced by older people who are thought to be more reliable

‘I don’t want to force any 15, 16 or 17 year old into any particular job but most of us would say that actually doing some work is beneficial thing. There are things you learn as well as getting some money in your pocket.’

Mr Hind's all-party group on social mobility is examining how prepared young people are for the world of work.

Employers said changes in the law made it harder to hire children.

Graeme Collins, from the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, said that whilst the majority of newspaper deliveries were carried out by young people, 'there has been some some shift towards toward employing adults in this role'.

'This reflects legislative changes which impact on the employment of young people and also an increasing use of motor vehicles to undertake deliveries.'

The National Union of Students suggested part-time jobs could be being snapped up by older university undergraduates.

Toni Pearce, NUS Vice-President for further education, said: 'Rising youth unemployment in recent years, and struggles to find work further up the career ladder could mean that university students and potentially even graduates are taking the jobs that previously would have gone to college students.'

The education select committee has launched an inquiry into careers guidance for young people.

EEF, the manufacturers organisation, told the inquiry: ‘If … young people are not proactively seeking work outside of their studies, then there is the risk that young people will not have any form of work experience upon leaving the education system,  which will significantly impact their employability skills and prospects for the future.’

The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said there should be more ‘encouragement for pupils to take on internships, voluntary activities and Saturday jobs, to gain work experience and insight into working life’.
