Every ant species known to mankind will soon be chronicled in high-definition 3D.

A team of U.S. scientists is on a mission to visit museums around the world and catalogue detailed images of every ant in their collections.

The study, which is being led by Dr Brian Fisher from the California Academy of Sciences, is the first time that researchers have photographed the insects in such fine detail.

Their new microscopic imaging technique provides scientists with a hitherto unglimpsed look into ants' anatomy.

On their 'world ant tour', the scientists will add their findings to a database called Antweb, a detailed resource that, it is hoped, will prove invaluable to insect researchers.

Dr Fisher told the BBC: 'Our goal is to image 10,000 a year.'

The researchers have so far photographed 8,000 ant species from collections at museums in the U.S. and are aiming to image up to 30,000.

They are currently visiting the Natural History Museum in London to chronicle the more than 6,000 species held in its vaults.

At each stop, the team images several specimens of each species, so that the database is as complete as possible. This involves photographing different sexes and ant castes - queens, soldiers and workers.

Each preserved ant is subjected to dozens of highly-magnified photos at different levels of focus.

This data is then fed into a computer and a 3D image is built, one that allows scientists to explore each ant's anatomy in never-before-seen detail

Dr Fisher told the BBC: 'You can zoom in and see fine hairs, the eyes, all of this detail. And all of this, under a microscope, is not in focus.

'So this is actually the first time, as a scientist, I get to see this ant in 3D.'

The Antweb imaging archive will not just be available to scientists.

As Dr Fisher explains, 'anyone, anywhere and at any time' can log in and sample the research.
