David Cameron today vowed to hunt down British-raised ISIS executioner ‘Jihadi John’ and put him ‘out of action’.

The Prime Minister refused to confirm that the Islamist fanatic filmed beheading hostages in Syria was the Londoner Mohammed Emwazi after he was finally identified yesterday.

But Mr Cameron said the Government would do everything it could to tack down terrorists committing ‘appalling and heinous crimes’ against British citizens anywhere in the world.

The PM also hit back at criticism of the security services in the wake of yesterday’s unmasking of Emwazi, amid revelations that he had been on MI5’s radar for years.

He said the security services did ‘extraordinary’ work to keep Britain safe – and revealed they had even foiled a terror plot ‘in the last few months’.

Kuwaiti-born Emwazi moved to Britain as a six-year-old child – and quickly embraced British life, playing football in the affluent streets of West London while supporting Manchester United.

Neighbours recalled a polite, quietly spoken boy who was studious at his Church of England school, where he was the only Muslim pupil in his class.

After finishing primary school in 1999, Emwazi moved to Quintin Kynaston Community Academy, in St John’s Wood, where he is believed to have studied alongside former X Factor judge and pop star Tulisa Contostavlos

Once there, he became more observant of his religion and began wearing more traditional Islamic dress, and his sisters began to wear the hijab.

Speaking in Wales, alongside the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Mr Cameron launched an impassioned defence of the security services

In August 2009, after his graduation, Emwazi flew to Tanzania where they were picked up by MI5 – who accused him of planning to travel to Somalia to join the militant group Al Shabaab.

Mr Cameron today refused to name Enwazi but said: ‘When there are people anywhere in the world who commit appalling and heinous crimes against British citizens we will do everything we can with the police with the security services with all that we have at our disposal to find these people and put them out of action.’

The PM said this was his ‘number one priority’.

Speaking in Wales, alongside the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Mr Cameron also launched an impassioned defence of the security services.

But he suggested the House of Commons Security and Intelligence Committee could review MI5’s failure to stop Enwazi travelling to Syria to join ISIS. 

Mr Cameron said: ‘I work very closely with our security services. I meet with them regularly, I ask them searching questions about that they do – and in my almost five years of experience as Prime Minister I think they are incredibly impressive, hardworking, dedicated, courageous and affective at protecting our country.

‘All of the time they are having to make incredibly difficult judgements and I think basically they make very good judgements on our behalf.

‘While we are in the middle of this vast effort to make sure British citizens are sage, the most important thing is to get behind them.’

But the Prime Minister said there were ‘proper ways of calling security and intelligence services to account’ where there were concerns – and pointed to the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee.

However, he added: ‘I am satisfied we have in place the right ways of scrutinising the work these extraordinary men and women do on our behalf.

‘All I can say is even in the last few months their dedication and work has saved us from plots on the streets of the United Kingdom that could’ve done immense damage, so it is a moment to stand up and thank them for the work they do on our behalf.’
