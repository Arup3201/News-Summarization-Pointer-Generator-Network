Sarah Chavez, 22, is accused of fatally stabbing a 30-year-old woman at a Las Vegas bar on Tuesday night

A 22-year-old woman has been arrested for allegedly fatally stabbing a mother of two who tripped her boyfriend over in a Las Vegas bar on Tuesday night.

Sarah Ann Chavez is accused of killing 30-year-old Misty Elaine Madera following a brawl at Champagne's Cafe on South Maryland Parkway about 11pm.

Officers found Madera lying in the back parking lot with stab wounds to her neck as Chavez, covered in blood, was being held back by a bar patron.

Madera was rushed to Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center but was pronounced dead shortly after arriving.

Witnesses told police the dispute was triggered when Madera tripped Chavez’s
boyfriend inside the bar as he walked to the restroom, Las Vegas Sun reported.

Chavez allegedly confronted Madera, from Las Vegas, and they argued briefly.

Chavez and her boyfriend were about to leave the bar, before Chavez decided the issue wasn't settled.

She again confronted Madera, but this time Madera's sister got involved.

The 
fight spilled out a back door and into the lot. A bar patron allegedly separated the women, but Chavez punched Madera.

Madera reportedly yelled, 'She has a knife', before she was attacked. A bartender called 911 after seeing blood.

Las Vegas Sun reported the bar patron who had separated the 
women detained Chavez while waiting for police.

He also warned Chavez’s 
boyfriend to stay away from them. The boyfriend allegedly left before police 
arrived.

Chavez later told police she started the physical altercation in the bar because she felt 'threatened' when Madera stood up.

Chavez said she punched Madera 
in the chest and the fight was on.

The young woman also admitted she armed herself on 
the way back into the bar because she was afraid of the two women.

Police discovered a Smith and Wesson folding knife south of the scene.

Chavez has been jailed without bond in the Clark County Detention Center on one count of murder with a deadly weapon.

Madera is survived by her husband, Willie Henning, and their two young sons.

Henning's sister, Summer Aura Henning, yesterday posted to Facebook a picture of her sister-in-law with a heartfelt message:

'A life taken way too soon. You are loved Misty and will forever be in our hearts. Thank you for loving my brother the way you did, for being such a wonderful aunt to my babies and for giving me the gift of being an aunt. I promise to always be here for the boys!!!!'
