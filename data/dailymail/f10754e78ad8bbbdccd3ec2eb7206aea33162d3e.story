Wayne Rooney is beginning to reach the later stages of his football career, but he may yet have an alternative once he hangs up his boots.

The 29-year-old striker revealed that he would like to appear on ITV's singing show The X Factor once his playing days are over.

The Manchester United forward made the revelation on MUTV show 'The Big United Quiz' which will be aired on Tuesday.

During the show, host Angus Deayton asked both teams which player the fans think would do best on The X Factor and another reality show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.

Rooney's name came out top on both occasions, and the striker said: 'When I finish playing, I would like to do something like X Factor.

But fans of I'm A Celebrity will be disappointed to hear that it is not something Rooney wants to get into.
