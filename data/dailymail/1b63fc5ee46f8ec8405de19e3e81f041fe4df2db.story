Vanessa Stiviano, the woman at the center of allegations of racism aimed at LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, 80, has denied she is his girlfriend.

Sources close to Stiviano has claimed that the 31-year-old works in a purely professional capacity for Sterling as his 'archivist' and spilts her time between the Clippers and the teams official charity.

Stiviano is currently being sued by Sterling's estranged wife Shelly for allegedly embezzling $1.8 million from him during the four years she has been working for the billionaire.

Bizarre: Despite Stiviano's lawyer stating that the model wasn't Sterling's 'first rodeo', she is now claiming she isn't his girlfriend

Refusing to answer questions when reporters caught up with her outside her home on Sunday, Stiviano has allegedly been gifted four sports cars by Sterling and his wife believes the two have been involved in a relationship.

This comes as it was claimed that Sterling contacted Stiviano to ask, 'How can we make this go away?' amid claims she has more than 100 hours of recordings, it has been reported.

Stiviano has insisted a racist recording in which the NBA boss allegedly tells her not to bring black people to his games is authentic but she claims she wasn't the one who leaked it to the media.

Sterling contacted Stiviano on Sunday and was told to contact her lawyer, TMZ Sports has now reported.

Her attorney Mac Nehoray said in an e-mail Sunday to the Los Angeles Times V. Stiviano's attorney Mac Nehoray said Sunday that the male voice heard on the 15-minute recording making incredibly offensive remarks to his client about African Americans is definitely Sterling's.

But the NBA boss claimed Stiviano released it in a bid to 'get even' with his wife, Shelly Sterling, who is suing the archivist for allegedly seducing her wealthy husband.

'Due to the present litigation and its absurd allegations, which Ms. Stiviano vehemently denies, Ms. Stiviano and this office have no comments at this time,' Nehoray said in a statement to the newspaper.

Stiviano, 38, sparked a firestorm on Saturday by allegedly leaking the audio recording of the 81-year-old Clippers owner launching a racist rant in which he berated her for being seen in public with black friends, including Magic Johnson.

The shocking clip set off a massive scandal, with current and former NBA players like LeBron James and Charles Barkley calling on the league to take immediate action against Sterling.

The NBA is investigating the claims and is set to make a decision within days.

In the meantime, a lawsuit filed by Sterling's estranged wife of 50 years Rochelle claims to show how the Clipper’s owner treated his girlfriend before the apparent row – by lavishing her with a series of gifts including a Ferrari, two Bentleys, a Range Rover and a $1.4million apartment. 

In court documents filed March 7 by Sterling's spouse of 50 years and the mother of his three children, Rochelle Sterling writes that her husband and Stiviano - who also goes by the aliases Vanessa Maria Perez, Monica Gallegos, Maria Monica Perez Gallegos and Maria Valdez – first met in 2010 at the Super Bowl.

According to Mrs Sterling's lawsuit, cited by the Los Angles Times, over the past four years, her husband used their commonly owned resources to buy his girlfriend a 2012 Ferrari, a pair of Bentleys and a 2013 Range Rover worth a total of more than $500,000.

In additional to the high-end vehicles, some of which are prominently featured on Stiviano's instagram account documenting her high-flying lifestyle, Mr Sterling also gifted her $1.8million to buy a duplex on West 4th Street in Los Angeles and $240,000 for living expenses.

Mrs Sterling's lawsuit, which claims that her husband gave Stiviano money and presents without her consent, seeks full restitution along with unspecified compensatory damages.

According to Rochelle Sterling, before she filed her complaint in court, Donald Sterling himself had asked Stiviano to return the money and property, but the woman allegedly refused.

Stiviano's attorney, Mac Nehoray, presented a counter-argument, claiming that a gift cannot be revoked by the giver – legalese for ‘no taksies backsies.’

In a court filing, the lawyer also insisted that there is not ‘a peppercorn of a fact’ that his client committed any fraud or exercised undue influence.

Nehoray added that nowhere in Mrs Sterling’s lawsuit does it say that ‘the feminine wiles of Ms. Stiviano overpowered the iron will of’ Donald Sterling, ‘who is well known as one of the most shrewd businessmen in the world.’
