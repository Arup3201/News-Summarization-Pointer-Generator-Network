An Arizona State University student is dead after she fell while rappelling from a cliff in the Tonto National Forest.

The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office says 21-year-old Katelyn M. Conrad was rappelling in Coon Bluff, a popular recreation area near the Salt River, on Saturday morning when the accident occurred.

Sheriff's Office spokesman Chris Hegstrom says she fell about 125 feet and was unresponsive. Despite life-saving efforts by deputies, Conrad was pronounced dead.

Sad: Conrad, the daughter of a Phoenix cop, fell 125 feet and was found unresponsive by some of the 20 to 25 climbers she was with Saturday morning

Authorities say Conrad was part of a group of 20 to 25 climbers from ASU.

'There was only 1 or 2 people actually with her at the time of the fall, everybody else heard screams and came to the scene,' Sgt. Aaron Flowers with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department told Fox 10 Phoenix.

They also say Conrad, who was from nearby Gilbert, was the daughter of a Phoenix police lieutenant.

Saguaro Lake is about 30 miles east of Phoenix. 

Investigators are looking into the cause but say it appears to be accidental.

Friends of Conrad's created a Facebook page inviting those who knew her to a vigil in her honor scheduled for Monday.

The invitation reads: 

'In memory of Katelyn we would like to hold a candlelight vigil to spend some time together to remember Katelyn and come together to lift her up as a community.

'We will be meeting at the saddle of A mountain at 6:30pm. Please bring candles, flowers, signs, or anything you would like to share in honor of Katelyn.

'Let this be a time for us to come together as one as we get through this difficult time.'
