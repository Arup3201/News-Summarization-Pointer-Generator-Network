Burnley have made an enquiry for AC Milan striker Giampaolo Pazzini.

The 30-year-old is being offered to clubs around Europe as Milan look to cut their wage bill.

Burnley are looking to bolster their strike-force but would prefer a loan deal until the end of the season.

Pazzini is being offered to clubs around Europe as Serie A giants Milan look to cut their wage bill

They have a limited budget and are looking to take a sensible economic approach to January rather than gamble heavily and risk burdening the club with debt.

Italy international Pazzini has an excellent goalscoring record but struggles for a regular starting place and has played just 74 minutes this season.

The Milan frontman came on as a substitute during his side's 2-0 victory over Udinese on Sunday. 

Starting his career with Atalanta, the attacker has spent his entire career in his homeland, also playing for Fiorentina, Sampdoria and Inter Milan.
