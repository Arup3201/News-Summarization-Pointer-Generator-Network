Sandra Byrnes and Jeni Winkels' friendship is one that flourished out of both tragedy and a miracle.

The two women first met 13 years ago after being offered a rare opportunity to meet through a special program which connected organ donors with their transplant recipients.

Almost 20 years ago, Sandra's life took an unexpected and terrible turn when her 18-year-old son Allen died after being hit by a car on the highway.

Describing her son as a popular and happy young man who loved sport, she was left devastated after the horrific accident.

But the 60-year-old Sydney mother took solace in the fact that her son's organs would help save the lives of six other people, hoping that one day she would be given the chance to meet them.

One of those people was  Jeni from Newcastle who was in dire need  of a kidney and pancreas transplant at the age of 33.

Jeni had suffered from diabetes since she was only 10-years-old, and was on dialysis when she was told that doctors had found her a donor. 

Jeni received a kidney and pancreas transplant from Sandra's son Allen, who died after being hit by a car. They met via a special program which connected donors with their transplant recipients

'The day I got the phone call, the first thing I thought was that somebody had died for me,' Jeni told Yours magazine.

'I thought a lot about what that person's family was going through.' 

Jeni began writing thank-you letters to Sandra, which were anonymously delivered by the Red Cross, until the two women were finally given the opportunity to meet. 

'I died when my son died,' Sandra (left) said, 'When I met Jeni, we talked and laughed for five hours'

The duo had an instant connection and became the closest of friends after their initial meeting. 

'I died when my son died,' Sandra told Yours magazine,'When I met Jeni, we talked and laughed for five hours.'

Sandra and Jeni continued to keep in touch with Jeni always thanking her new friend for the life experiences that the young teen had given her.

For Sandra, Jeni is a constant reminder or her brave son who she believes would have loved the woman whom his organs gave a second chance at life. 

'She was sitting at our table [at my wedding] and when my father told everyone who she was, they gave her standing ovation,' Jeni said. 

'She said in a way, it felt like Allen was the one getting married.' 

But the women have also been there for each other through the harder moments of life.

As Jeni's transplant kidney has finally come to the end of its life, leaving her on dialysis once more and awaiting for her husband's donor status to be approved, Sandra has stood by her friend's side as a constant pillar of support.
