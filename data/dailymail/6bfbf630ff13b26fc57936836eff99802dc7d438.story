Prince Harry is a 'jackal' intent on killing innocent people while 'drunk' in Afghanistan, one of the country's feared warlords has said.

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who is listed as one of the world's most wanted terrorists by the United States, launched the verbal attack as the Royal spent 
Christmas in the war-torn country.

Hekmatyar, who was once prime minister of Afghanistan, said Harry is being 'hunted' by the Taliban and in one assault on a base was forced to 'find a hole to hide himself'.

The jihadist also promised that until British 'invaders' leave in 2014 they will be attacked and murdered with even greater intensity.

'Jackal': Prince Harry, who is currently in Afghanistan, has been accused of killing innocent people while drunk, by a notorious warlord

Harry is currently on a four month long deployment to Afghanistan serving his second tour of duty as gunship co-pilot.

Hekmatyar also mocked Britain's involvement in the 'cruel conflict' to please 'American generals'.

'The British Prince comes to Afghanistan to kill innocent Afghans while he is drunk. He wants to hunt down Mujaheddin with his helicopter rockets without any shame,' he said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph.

'But he does not understand this simple fact that the hunting of Afghan lions and eagles is not that easy! Jackals cannot hunt lions.

'It seems that some British authorities still dream about the times of the eighteenth and nineteenth century and they want their ambassador to be treated like a viceroy and their prince to go out in uniform to hunt for human beings and play the satanic role that they used to play in the past.'

The warlord - who is the founder and leader of the Hezb-e Islami political party and paramilitary group - also referenced the attack on the base where Harry was stationed in October.

Speaking from his hideaway on the Afghan/Pakistan border, he added: 'During the Mujaheddin attack on the American base the Prince saw that he was the one about to be hunted and was searching for a hole in which to hide himself.'

Two American Marines were killed in the attack before Western soldiers led by British troops killed 18 of the attackers and took one prisoner.

Gulbidden Hekmatyar was the celebrated and fearsome force credited with ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in 1989.

However, as one of the most deadly of the 
Mujahideen leaders, he was also accused of dedicating himself to 'fighting 
other Mujahideen rather than killing Soviets'.

At the heart of his political views is that he strongly opposes the presence of foreign troops in his country and that all efforts should be made to remove them by force.

He has also adopted extreme Islamist views and was Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993 to 1994 and again briefly in 1996.

The former PM is accused of being behind an attack that killed 25,000 civilians in the 90s, for example.

He later fled to Iran after the Taliban took control of the country.

An enemy of current Afghan president Karzai, he lives somewhere near the country's border with Pakistan and has been accused of having links to Bin Laden and al-Qaeda.

The Taliban rushed to claim a propaganda victory, saying that Prince Harry, who is an Apache helicopter pilot based at Bastion, was the intended victim of the attack.

Qari Youssef Ahmadi, the Taliban’s spokesman, said: 'We attacked that base because Prince Harry was also on it and so they can know our anger. Thousands more suicide attackers are ready to give up their lives for the sake of the Prophet.'

Harry’s arrival at Camp Bastion in September, where he will serve with 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps came four weeks after a storm over his antics in Las Vegas.

Pictures emerged of the prince naked during an alcohol-fuelled game of strip billiards in his £5,100-a-night suite at the luxurious Encore Wynn Hotel.

Although he was said to be letting off steam ahead of his deployment to Afghanistan, the third-in-line to the throne received a stern dressing-down by senior officers for his role in the frolics.

Meanhwhile Hekmatyar, who has been labelled a 'war criminal' by President Hamid Karzai's government in Kabul, has already seen Afghanistan torn apart by fighting after playing an important role during the civil war. But his co-operation and the involvement of his political party is still seen as vital to ensure the acceptance of a new democratically-elected government.

But while Hekmatyar has called for a 'peaceful transition of the government' to democracy, he warned that the country faced plunging into anarchy following the withdrawal of British troops in 2014.

He remarked that the current situation in Afghanistan resembles the time shortly before the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers in the 1980s.

But while he insisted the country may be plunged into chaos following British troops leaving the country, he also insisted withdrawal of 'all foreign forces' before his party would participate in the 2014 presidential elections.

The Government has been forced into a response to Hekmatyar's rant.

A Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesman said: 'The suggestion that any member of the UK Armed Forces deployed on operations operates under the influence of alcohol is simply absurd - not least because the consumption of alcohol by UK military personnel is not permitted under any circumstances while deployed in Afghanistan.

'UK troops deployed and remain in Afghanistan to protect our national security by removing what was a safe haven for international terrorism.'
