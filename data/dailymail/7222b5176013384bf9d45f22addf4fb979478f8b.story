Parking officials have come under fire for refusing to cancel a fine given to a woman while she underwent emergency treatment to save her unborn baby.

Heavily pregnant Sian Vaughan parked her car on a meter outside the hospital she attended for a routine appointment.

She expected to return to her car an hour later but was admitted to a ward because she had the condition pre-eclampsia which could have been life-threatening to her baby.

Fined: Sian Vaughan, pictured with baby Ollie, was given a £35 parking ticket because her car had over-stayed the permitted time on the meter

Mrs Vaughan remained in hospital and gave birth to healthy baby boy, Ollie, two days later.

While she was in there she was given a £35 parking ticket because her car had over-stayed the permitted time on the meter.

But she was stunned when she later appealed the fine and was knocked back by her local council because her circumstances did not justify cancelling the ticket.

Mrs Vaughan, from Dorchester, said: 'At my appointment I was admitted there and then because my blood pressure was so high that there was a serious risk to me and the baby.

'There was nothing I could do about it, it was such a shock and I was on my own so it was scary.

'The last thing I was worrying about was moving my car.

'I knew I was in a restricted area but I thought if I explained the situation to the council they would understand.

'I’m not saying I didn’t do anything wrong but all I want is a bit of humanity. Do they really think I would put my baby’s life at risk to go out and move my car?'

Mrs Vaughan, who has two other sons, Charlie, aged seven, and Jack, 15, later emailed the council to appeal the ticket which was issued outside the Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester.

She said: 'I emailed the council to say I was sorry and explained I was admitted in an emergency and there was nothing I could do.

'They replied saying: ''We do appreciate and understand your circumstances but unfortunately hospital appointments can overrun.

'We have considered your case and are satisfied that the ticket was administered correctly.'

'The thing they don’t seem to understand is my appointment didn’t just overrun, it was a medical emergency. I had developed a condition called pre-eclampsia, and it can kill.

'I was being monitored because it was life threatening to me and my baby.'

Mrs Vaughan, who runs Vaughan’s Bistro in Weymouth with her husband, was fined £35 to be paid within 14 days. She paid it as she didn't want to risk it rising to £70.

She has received much support on an online forum where users have criticised the council.

One commenter said: 
'So in other words, we can all drop dead just as long as the Dorset 
County Council gets it’s money. I find that totally disgusting.'

Another wrote: 'Clearly a brainless, compassionless muppet (sic) in DCC who fully deserves to have their job cut.'

A third poster added: 'Typical 
council attitude. But, they get away with it because they are the 
council, unlike businesses that have to keep customers, they have a 
monopoly and manage to abuse it at every opportunity.

'Remember, we all pay for this bunch of muppets.'

A Dorset County Council spokesman said: 'The parking ticket was challenged through our website and, though we are sympathetic to the circumstances, we felt that the details given weren’t sufficient to justify cancelling the ticket.

'The ticket can still be challenged through official means as described on the back of the penalty charge notice.'
