A 31-year-old medical saleswoman has been found murdered in her suburban Arizona home in mysterious circumstances.

Allison Feldman, 31, was found dead at home by her boyfriend in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale Wednesday afternoon.

According to family, Feldman 'had no negatives in her life', was happy in her job - and planned to get engaged to her boyfriend, Alex, in a matter of months.

Authorities say they are withholding details of Feldman's death for fear of tipping of potential suspects in the killing.

Though they declined to identify anybody they are looking for, officers are clear that the death is a homicide. 

Scottsdale police department also said they had no history of being called to Feldman's address, on the edge of the bustling Old Town district. 

According to the local Fox10 news station, Feldman had lived at the home for eight months, and had been seeing her boyfriend for ten.

Feldman, who comes from Minnesota but has lived in Arizona since college, was encouraged to get an alarm system by her boyfriend, but hadn't got round to taking the advice.

Her father today spoke of the agony of not knowing anything his daughter's death as he paid tribute to the 'warm and friendly' woman.

Speaking from his home in Excelsior, Minnesota, Harley Feldman said: 'It's really hard because he have all kinds of visualizations going on. We can't sleep at night.'  

He described how his daughter worked in sales for a Swedish medical-device company and graduated from the University of Arizona, where she studied Spanish and communications.

She remained in Arizona after college partly because of the much warmer weather.

The two last spoke Tuesday night. She was excited for a business trip to a resort and had just bought a new dress. She also got a positive performance review at work.

He said: 'Her life was on the upswing. She was talking about getting engaged in a few months. No negatives in her life.'

'Everybody liked her. She's warm and friendly. She's caring. Those are the words people use all the time.'

He, his wife and Allison's sister are now planning funeral services in Minnesota and Arizona.
