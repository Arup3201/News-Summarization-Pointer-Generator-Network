A 75-year-old woman who shot her husband in the back of the head in the mid-1970s has finally been convicted of murder.

Alice Uden, from Chadwick in Missouri, faces 20 years to life in prison after being found guilty of second-degree murder, despite her defense that she killed 24-year-old Ronald Holtz because he was about to attack their two-year-old baby.

Holtz's body was recovered from an 
abandoned mine on a ranch between Cheyenne and Laramie last summer, with
 Alice Uden arrested in September along with her current husband Gerard,
 71, who was charged separately with killing his own wife and two 
children in 1980.Â 

Convicted: Alice Uden wore a grim expression as she left the courtroom in a wheelchair, looking frail in a white shirt and wire glasses. She faces 20 years to life for the second degree murder of her third husband

Actions of the past: Alice Uden listens to the judge during jury selection. None of her five children or other relatives were present for the verdict

Jurors found Alice Uden not guilty of 
first-degree murder, which would have carried a life sentence, but 
passed on the least-serious option of finding her guilty of 
manslaughter.

She wore a grim expression as she left the courtroom in a wheelchair, looking frail in a white shirt and wire glasses.

'It's
 just been a long time coming. I don't think it's fully sunk in yet,' 
Uden's attorney, Donald Miller, said of her reaction to the verdict. He 
added that they planned to appeal the conviction.

Laramie County District Attorney Scott Homar indicated he was satisfied with the verdict.

'The jury made it clear that they believe she at least purposely and maliciously killed the victim,' he said.

None of Uden's five children or other relatives were present for the verdict.

In
 a bizarre twist in the case, Uden's husband Gerard was arrested at the 
same time as her, on separate charges of killing his own wife and two 
children in 1980.

Police 
haven't linked the two cold cases that brought the elderly couple 
quietly living out their senior years in rural Ozarks in Missouri back 
to the state of Wyoming to face murder charges.

Prosecutors could not mention Gerald 
Uden or his case at Alice Uden's trial, but Alice Uden testified she 
remarried two years after Holtz's death.

Juror Samantha Wallace, 33, said the jury was unfamiliar with Gerald Uden's case.

'I
 don't think that would have persuaded us. But we kind of thought, 
'Where is her [current] husband? Who is her husband?' Wallace said.

Alice
 Uden testified she shot Holtz sometime in late 1974 or early 1975, just
 as he was about to attack her toddler daughter. Prosecutors said Uden, 
of Chadwick, Missouri, killed Holtz while he slept.

At
 one point, as many as 11 jurors favored a first-degree murder 
conviction, but one insisted Alice Uden was guilty of no more than 
manslaughter, Wallace said.

They compromised on second-degree murder to avoid becoming deadlocked and risking a mistrial, she added.

'It
 was hard to be in there. Emotions. People crying,' Wallace said of the 
scene in the jury room as they deliberated for about 13 hours over two 
days.

Alice Uden testified 
that after she shot Holtz, she emptied Christmas decorations from a 
55-gallon cardboard barrel and stuffed his 175-pound body inside.

She
 rolled the barrel from her porch into her car trunk and drove to a 
ranch where she and a previous husband had been caretakers until his 
death in 1973.

Her trial 
featured emotional testimony from one of her sons, who said Alice Uden 
told him in the 1970s she killed Holtz as he slept.

While on the witness stand, Todd Scott also turned to his frail mother and said: 'I hate you.'

Uden was married to Ronald Holtz, her third husband, for only a month or two.

A nurse, she met the 24-year-old Vietnam veteran while working in the psychiatric unit of a Veterans Administration hospital in Sheridan.

Hospital records cited at trial showed Holtz had a history of violent outbursts and drug use.

'He was extremely violent, unpredictable and impulsive,' Miller said in his closing argument on Tuesday.

Murder: Gerald Uden said his wife Virginia Uden (pictured) had become 'intolerable'

Alice Uden said Holtz became abusive soon after they married in September 1974.

She said he had a job driving a taxi at night and, one morning, he flew into a rage when her two-year-old daughter began crying while he was trying to sleep.

Uden testified that Holtz knocked her down while storming toward the girl's bedroom.

She said she grabbed her .22-caliber rifle from a broom closet and shot Holtz in the back of the head as he stood above the child's crib. Prosecutors argued Holtz was asleep when Uden shot him.

'The fling she had started was no longer a good time for her. And Mr. Holtz maybe wasn't the man she thought he was,' Homar said in his closing argument.

He also said Uden kept changing her story when investigators interviewed her.

At one point she said she got the gun from a bedroom closet much further away from the crib - and much less readily available in the supposedly urgent situation.

Wallace said she believed the shooting was premeditated.

'She thought about it... She knew that she was going to kill him. Whatever closet it was didn't matter,' she said.

In the other case, Gerald Uden has already pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree murder for shooting his ex-wife, Virginia Uden, and her two sons in central Wyoming in 1980.

When Alice and Gerald Uden met is unclear, but they married in November 1976, five months after Gerald and Virginia Uden separated.

While entering his plea in November, Gerald Uden was vague about his motive but said Virginia Uden, 32, had become 'intolerable'.
