The venture capitalist who poured cash into Skype and Hotmail has called for
Silicon Valley to become its own US state.

Tim Draper said he wants to make the tech hub independent so it can set its
own laws and put more money into new technologies.

He wants Silicon Valley to be allowed to experiment with not-yet legal
technologies like drones and driverless cars without having to seek approval
first.

Mr Draper’s bold plan is called ‘Six Californias’ and would see California
carved up into half a dozen zones, one of which would be Silicon Valley.

He has drafted a ballot proposition, created a website and will put it to
lawmakers in the hope they will make it a reality.

Mr Draper told TechCrunch that Silicon Valley, which has been the home of
technology in the US since the 1980s, needs to funnel back the money that it
makes into more research and development, instead of funding welfare programmes
elsewhere in California.

The state would be split up into Jefferson, North California, Central
California, West California (which would include Los Angeles, South California,
and Silicon Valley.

The debts would be split up according to the number of people in each
region, as would the assets in each area.

Mr Draper would also create a new office for himself, the ‘Agent of the
state of California’ which would allow him to appoint a lawyer who is more
powerful in Silicon Valley than the state Attorney General.

Mr Draper said: 'Each new state can start fresh. From a new crowd sourced state flower to a more relevant constitution. Decisions can be more relevant to the population. The regulations in one new state are not appropriate for another'

Venture capitalist Tim Draper wants Silicon Valley to be able to set up its own laws.

This would allow the tech hub to experiment with not-yet legal technologies such as drones and driverless cars, without having to ask for permission.

He believes the Valley needs to reinvest the money it makes in research and development instead of funding welfare programmes.

Mr Draper said his 'Six Californias' plan encourages more competition, less monopolistic power and a more relevant constitution.

Speaking to TechCrunch, he said the proposal ‘encourages more competition
and less monopolistic power’.

He said: ‘Each new state can start fresh. From a new crowd sourced state
flower to a more relevant constitution.

‘Decisions can be more relevant to the population. The regulations in one
new state are not appropriate for another.’

Mr Draper is no stranger to unusual investments and has spent $15m on a school
voucher programme in California and also sunk more cash into his Draper
University of Heroes, a school for start-up wannabes.

The plans were also reported by New York magazine, which called them an
‘isolationist manifesto for the tech sector’.

Its report pointed out that in order to become reality, Mr Draper’s plan
would require an amendment to the state constitution approved by California
voters.

It would also need approval by Congress, meaning that for now at least it is
unlikely to happen.

Mr Draper is not the first person to come up with a bold vision of the
future for the tech world.

PayPal co-founder and billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel has put
forward a proposal for a floating island 200 miles off the coast of San
Francisco that would serves as its own nation state.

Libertarian island, founded on extreme libertarian ideals, would house 270
residents and would be a social experiment where the residents could live with
loose planning permission, no welfare, no minimum wage - and no restrictions on
the weapons they could own.
