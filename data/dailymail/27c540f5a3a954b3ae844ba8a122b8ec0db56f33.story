Lovebirds who take to Twitter and Facebook to proclaim romantic feelings are a turn-off, a study claims.

Nearly a quarter of Britons have felt annoyed by VDAs – virtual displays of affection – research found.

Although nearly half those quizzed admitted to changing their Facebook status to ‘in a relationship’, couples who express their love for each other via social media commit a major faux pas, says the survey by dating website match.com.

It found that 33 per cent had read an online comment about a painful break-up, but 58 per cent would rather not know. And explicit posts were the biggest turn-off, with three-quarters of women saying they dislike that level of sharing.

Kate Taylor, the website’s relationship expert, said VDAs had replaced PDAs – public displays of affection – as cringe-inducing annoyances.

‘There’s nothing wrong with letting your close friends know you’re happy, but it’s important to keep in mind who you’re sharing it with,’ she said. ‘What might seem a sweet comment in the eyes of you and your friends could come across as sounding unintentionally smug.’

The study also found one in three people say they would rather not see people call their other halves by their pet names on social networking sites.

However, not all online displays of affection are balked at as 90 per cent of those quizzed said they don't mind seeing a shared profile picture of a friend and their boyfriend or girlfriend.

Kate Taylor added: 'Remember, VDAs invite a similar reception to PDAs, while you might think nothing of a quick smooch on public transport, but it can make observers feel uncomfortable.

'Try to limit your personal messages to a private and secure site, rather than sharing them over social media. In this context, your VDAs remain moving and romantic and you won't be accused of attention-seeking.'
