Leigh Halfpenny says Wales is using the 'hurt' of last year's RBS 6 Nations defeat by England at Twickenham as motivation for Friday's rematch in Cardiff, but as his side went through their captain's run there was justified confidence in the camp.

A healthy combination of intensity and calm filled the crowdless Millennium Stadium as Sam Warburton puts Warren Gatland's squad through their paces before the Six Nations opener in the elements on Friday night.

Halfpenny admitted the 29-18 turnaround on England's turf last year in which his boot provided Wales' only points weighed heavily on his team but that their win over South Africa at the end of the autumn gave them the boost they needed before taking on the northern hemisphere's finest.

Halfpenny kicked all of Wales' 18 points in their loss to England last year but is fired-up to turn the result around on Friday

'We were disappointed last year to have gone there and not perform to the standards we set ourselves,' he said.

'And that is something that has been with us since. We will use that hurt to full effect.

'We have done our analysis and things and it was not easy to watch. The performance wasn't the standard it should be, so Friday night is an opportunity to put that right.

'I think the pressure we have is what we put on ourselves to perform. That's what we put on ourselves and what we need on Friday night.'

Halfpenny is among 13 of the side that started at Twickenham who return for the latest England clash on Friday, which comes just under eight months before the countries meet in a crunch World Cup pool game.

Both countries ended their autumn campaigns earlier this season with notable victories - England also overcame southern hemisphere competition in Australia - which has set the scene perfectly for match number 126 between two of rugby's oldest and fiercest rivals.

'There is always that buzz about Wales versus England and the history that goes with it,' Halfpenny added.

'We got that monkey off the back in November, beating a southern hemisphere team, so that breeds confidence and we have come into camp, trained hard and prepared well for Friday's game.'

And while England have been rocked by repeated injury setbacks ahead of the Six Nations campaign - Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell, Courtney Lawes, Joe Launchbury, Tom Wood and Ben Morgan are currently among those absent - Halfpenny is taking little notice.

'Whatever side they picked was going to be strong,' he said. 'They have quality across the park and we know that to get a result we need to be at our best. They are a quality side and we have to be right up there.

'For me, running out into that packed Millennium Stadium is the best feeling ever.

'Running out for your country in front of your home fans is an immense feeling. The hairs at the back of your neck stand up and there is that huge buzz you get.

'It's a hell of a feeling and I am lucky enough to have an opportunity to do that on Friday night. We have a huge challenge ahead of us.'
