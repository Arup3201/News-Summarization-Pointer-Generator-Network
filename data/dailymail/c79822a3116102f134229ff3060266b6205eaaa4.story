Roy Hodgson can afford himself a smug smile of satisfaction knowing that right now he can confidently claim that four of the Premier League's best five goalkeepers on current form are English.

It must be years since any England manager could have looked at the top flight and been able to make that boast.

Unfortunately the best isn't available to Hodgson, but remarkably he isn't a regular for his own national team.

Here's my top five in reverse order:

5 Robert Green (QPR) – He has made some outstanding stops for Rangers this season and has reduced the errors that used to raise so many doubts about his ability at the very top level. 

He's unfortunate to be returning to such good form at a time when England already have three goalkeepers unlikely to lose their place in the squad any time soon, injuries permitting. QPR are bottom of the league but that's not because of Green, who's been excellent.

4 Ben Foster (West Brom) – Far from the perfect keeper, indeed he sometimes makes me look technically gifted when the ball is at his feet. But for breathtaking shot-stopping there are few better. His tip over from Ayoze Perez against Newcastle at The Hawthorns earlier this month was the best save of the season so far in my opinion.

3 Fraser Forster (Southampton) – He's the clean-sheet king but that isn't always because the goalkeeper is brilliant. However, in this case, closer inspection of the action shows Forster has made a huge contribution to Southampton's success this season.

A big, commanding presence was something Saints needed and his confidence is infectious – as is the case with most keepers. 

An eyebrow-raising price tag hasn't affected him and although he is capable of calamity – he was at fault for Aston Villa's goal on Monday night - there are definitely strengths in his game that contribute more to his growing reputation.

2 Joe Hart (Manchester City) – It's only when you watch Hart live at a match that you fully appreciate what he brings. He's a leader, he has presence in the box, and he is confident and assertive in his decision-making. 

When people barked and ranted about his 'mistake' against Stoke earlier this season at the Etihad, it was because he is normally so good in one-on-one situations. 

I watched him on Saturday and with a less-than-rock-solid defence in front of him Hart made himself big and hard to beat several times in the second half with Swansea looking for an equaliser. His form for England has been excellent this season as well. 

Is he fault-free? No, but then not many are and that's what he is aiming for I'm sure. His confidence is sometimes interpreted as cockiness which is why some don't like him. I prefer to judge him on his goalkeeping. Is he the best in the Premier League? No, but he's not far off.

1 David de Gea (Manchester United) – He's gone from blunder-full to wonderful in his time at Old Trafford. He is now virtually a one-man defence for Manchester United – and boy have they needed him this season.

His masterclass against Everton earlier this season was stunning, and his save from Jack Wilshere at Arsenal on Saturday was one of the best we've seen in this campaign. Surely it's only a matter of time before he takes over from Iker Casillas for Spain. And maybe even for Real Madrid.

Of course there will be fans reading this and crying that their keeper isn't acknowledged (obviously not Liverpool fans).

Julian Speroni of Crystal Palace is particularly unfortunate not to make the top five. Brad Guzan is capable of the spectacular for Villa – witness his display in the goalless draw at West Ham.

Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois is an excellent keeper but he has so little to do at the moment it's hard to judge him. Lukas Fabianski at Swansea and Burnley's Tom Heaton have also surprised me with their level of performance this season as well.

There are some good keepers around the Premier League that's for sure and quite a few of them are English.
