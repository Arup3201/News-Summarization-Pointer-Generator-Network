A notorious British paedophile accused of molesting boys as young as eight in the Philippines may face extradition over child sex offences in the UK in the 1970s.

Douglas Slade, 73 – a founder of the reviled child sex advocacy group Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) – is on police bail after being repeatedly arrested for abusing boys from an elementary school opposite his home in Angeles City in the Philippines.

Wealthy Slade, who has boasted of bribing prosecutors and victims' families, boasted of paying his way out of trouble in the corrupt, poverty-racked Southeast Asian country which is a magnet for paedophiles and sex tourists, our investigation in December found.

Now, Mail Online has discovered that Slade faces possible extradition to the UK as detectives in Bristol investigate him for historical child sex offences linked to a nationwide paedophile network before he left Britain for the Philippines in 1985.

It comes as an alleged former victim of Slade contacted MailOnline to describe how he was molested at the age of 14.

Vile: Douglas Slade was warned he faced 40 years in jail over child abuse but boasted that he would pay to get case dropped. An alleged victim has told MailOnline he was introduced to Slade by former racing car driver Christopher Skeaping, who was jailed in 2009 for sex attacks on a boy aged 12 in the late 1980s

Extradition: Mail Online has discovered that Slade faces possible extradition to the UK as detectives in Bristol investigate him for historical child sex offences linked to a nationwide paedophile network, PIE, before he left Britain for the Philippines in 1985

Peeping Tom: Douglas Slade has built a house with a view directly into the primary school opposite and neighbours claim he is paying children £2 for 'sex acts' 

Slade, who lived in the Knowle West district of Bristol in the late 1970s and early 1980s, is suspected of abusing numerous underage boys passed between PIE members who tracked down youths for illegal sex. 

He is currently under investigation by Bristol CID as part of its Operation Bluestone inquiry into historical sex abuse cases, according to correspondence seen by MailOnline. The cases date to the 1960s and 1970s and include one case in Ireland.

Separately, a former victim allegedly abused by Slade and other PIE members, who is not part of the current UK investigation, has contacted MailOnline to describe how he was molested by Slade and then passed between paedophiles from 1979 when he was 14.

Now 50, Neil (not his real name) said he was introduced to Slade by another prominent PIE member, former racing car driver Christopher Skeaping, who was jailed in 2009 for sex attacks on a boy aged 12 in the late 1980s.

Skeaping lured boys to his West London home where, it is claimed, he introduced Neil to Slade who invited him on a number of occasions to his home in Bristol before passing him on to other paedophiles, including an elderly jeweller and a nightclub owner in the city.

At that time, Slade lived in Bristol between stints working as a recruitment agent for construction companies in Dubai, travelling to countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to find young men to work on building projects.

Before moving to the country, Slade would go on holiday to the Philippines with other paedophiles to pick up young boys for sex, the victim claimed, while one of the boys he lured to his Bristol home was only 12, said Neil.

Neil told Mail Online: 'When I read your article about Slade in the Philippines, I found it abhorrent to think that all these years on this person is still getting away with the molestation of children.

'I can understand how children in a poor country like the Philippines fall victim to Slade. I was a poor kid from London and at first I just felt someone was being nice to me for a change. I only realised later how wrong and corrupt it was.

Predator: Paedophile Douglas Slade was confronted by MailOnline about the charges he faced but claimed he was being set up and claimed 'someone wants me out of the country'. Now he could face extradition under an investigation by Bristol detectives

Hiding: Douglas Slade, 73, has been accused by neighbours of paying young boys for 'sex acts', and is said to spend time on his balcony gazing into the primary school opposite, where he also donates money despite facing repeated accusations of molesting children

Campaigner: Father Shay Cullen is fighting to have Douglas Slade brought to trial over previous allegations that have now been dropped after Slade boasted of paying his way out of court. Father Cullen trains child welfare volunteers at the Preda Foundation in Subic Bay, the Philippines

'There is a moral compass adults should have and they should not take away the innocence of a child in terms of their sexuality. Adults are there to protect children not to use them for their own gratification.'

Neil came from a poor home near Skeaping's house in West London and described how Skeaping and fellow PIE founder Slade allegedly groomed him and other young boys for sex.

'I was introduced to Chris Skeaping by a school friend,' he said. 'His house in Hounslow was like a youth club. There were always lads of my age there. You could run wild. He didn't mind. I started going round there because it was a place to hang out.

'Skeaping drove a huge BMW 1100 and had big American cars. For kids of 13, 14 and 15, those are exciting things. Douglas Slade turned up at his home one day. I was a very quiet child and he just picked up on me and I ended up going to Bristol several times.

'Apart from the sexual side of it, Slade was actually very nice to me. He made me feel special. He was doing nice things for me and it all seemed quite a good thing. I suppose if that's what grooming is, I was being groomed.'

It was on his third visit to Bristol that his relationship with Slade took a sinister turn. 'He started introducing me to people and I was used (sexually) by these people,' said Neil, naming an elderly jeweller and a nightclub and joke shop owner from the city.

Bribe: Douglas Slade has been faced with charges before but boasted that he would pay to have them dropped. He is currently on bail for child abuse and under investigation for possessing child porn, police say

No shame: When confronted by MailOnline Douglas Slade said 'There have been five cases (against me) in four years. They've all been dismissed. Somebody is trying to f***ing get rid of me'

Justice: Douglas Slade's case is being monitored in the Philippines by Catholic missionary and anti-paedophile campaigner Father Shay Cullen, who runs the Preda Foundation (above) to help the victims of child sex abuse and trafficking

Neil now plans to go to police with his testimony. 'I was affected by what happened to me for some years, but I got over it by being positive and coming to terms with it,' he said. 'Other victims might not be able to cope with what happened.

'If there is anything I can do to prevent this continuing, that is what I want to do. It is outrageous that these things are continuing to happen when they shouldn't.'

Slade was exposed as a paedophilia advocate along with Skeaping in 1975 and was caught by a national newspaper telling fellow deviants: 'If you want to have sex with children don't bottle it up – do it.'

A spokesman for Avon and Somerset police declined to give details about the investigation or to say if he expected an application to be made for Slade's extradition from the Philippines, saying: 'We are unable to comment at this time.'

An extradition treaty between Britain and the Philippines which can be applied retrospectively has been agreed and is currently in the process of being ratified in Manila, depriving criminals of a well-used bolthole in the Far East.

Slade's case is being monitored in the Philippines by Catholic missionary and anti-paedophile campaigner Father Shay Cullen who runs the Preda Foundation to help the victims of child sex abuse and trafficking.

Father Cullen helped bring Slade to court in 1995 when he faced up to 40 years in jail for abusing boys at his previous home in Angeles City before charges were dropped. Slade was caught boasting on camera at that time how prosecutors and families could be bribed.

Neighbours told Mail Online this month that boys as young as eight were still going regularly going into Slade's home since his release on bail for molesting and taking nude pictures of boys from the school opposite his home.

Standing guard: The entrance to Douglas Slade's imposing house in Angeles City is watched by a domestic staff member but the 73-year-old is said to invite young boys in and offer them money 

'The boys sit on his doorstep after school,' said Angelica Alcantara, 17. 'He comes out and picks the ones he wants and they go inside. He pays them to pose naked for pictures and to do other things for him. Afterwards he gives them 150 pesos (£2) and sends them home.'

Defiant Slade shouted 'You're an evil b*****d' at a Mail Online reporter from his balcony overlooking Amsic Elementary School when confronted a fortnight ago over his numerous arrests and claims he abuses pupils as young as eight for £2 a time.

Lawyers for the Preda Foundation, which has successfully pursued foreign paedophiles to their home countries in the past, are already preparing to take action against Slade on behalf of his victims in the Philippines if he returns to the UK.

'The children's parents have signed papers to say they will be represented by Preda in any action to find justice and compensation for the victims of Slade,' said Father Shay at his foundation's headquarters in Subic Bay where he has run a mission for nearly 40 years. 

'Slade has been able to bribe his way out of trouble in the past because he is very rich,' he said. 'He has a long history.' Slade, originally from Aylesbury, is wealthy through his food distribution business, Home Base, which provides meat to restaurants in the Philippines.
