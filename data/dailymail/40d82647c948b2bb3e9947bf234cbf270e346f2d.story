Stephen Sutton, the teenager whose positive approach to life saw him lead one of the biggest ever fundraising campaigns for research into cancer, has been awarded a posthumous MBE by the Queen. 

His mother accepted the honour at Buckingham Palace on behalf of the teenager, who died in May this year after a four year battle with cancer during which he inspired people around the world with his determination to make a difference.

Jane Sutton revealed her 19-year-old son described the award as 'awesome,' after he learned he would be named in the Queen's Birthday Honours list just days before his death.

The inspirational teenager from Burntwood in Staffordshire was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at the age of 15. But rather than let the disease beat him he decided to turn his diagnosis and treatment into something positive, eventually raising more than £5million for research into cancer.

Today Mrs Sutton collected the posthumous MBE on her son's behalf at Buckingham Palace - an occasion she described as 'bitter sweet' because she wished he had been there to collect it himself. 

She revealed that her teenage son was told days before his death that he was on the Queen's Birthday Honours list. 

She described today as 'a very proud moment but a bitter sweet occasion.' 

'I'm feeling so proud to be collecting the award on behalf of Stephen but obviously wish he had been here to collect it himself,' she added. 

'But it's just so nice that he knew about this award before he passed away, I'm so pleased about that.

'When he found out about it he did use the word "awesome", he thought it was awesome. I remember he was in the hospital bed and he had a big smile on his face.

'He knew how important this was and how high an honour this was.'

Mrs Sutton, who was accompanied by her parents and Stephen's younger brother, Christopher, said the Queen was 'very impressed' with the amount of money Stephen had raised and told her she must be very proud.

She added: 'He's touched the hearts of so many people and inspired so many people.

Mrs Sutton said the Queen said she had been impressed by the amount Stephen had raised for charity 

Stephen found out he was on the Queen's Birthday Honours list before he died and said the it was 'awesome'

'His fundraising is just part of his legacy. I don't think that's the only important thing because he also taught people to make the most of their lives and seize every opportunity.

'It's incredible. I know how many people Stephen touched, but he was just being Stephen.'

Stephen was told his cancer was terminal in 2012, but refused to let his illness change his life and completed his GCSEs and AS Levels.

He documented his treatment and struggle with cancer in a blog called Stephen's Story which was shared around the world and promoted by celebrities.

He also drew up a list of 46 weird and wonderful things he wanted to do - including doing a skydive and playing the drums in front of an audience of 90,000 at Wembley. 

Among this list was to raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust - a pledge that inspired the biggest ever fundraiser the charity has ever seen.

Stephen originally set out to raise a modest £10,000 for the charity but increased his goal to £1million after he posted his 'final thumbs up' selfie on Facebook in April. His story and the image captured the interest of celebrities and the public, and was shared around the world and people started donating in droves.

Before he died on May 14 at the age of 19, the teenager has raised more than £3million and donations continued to be made after his death, tipping £5million.

Stephen created a 'bucket list' of 46 things he wanted to do before he died, including to complete a skydive 

The teenager also listed 'hug an animal that is bigger than me' among his weird and wonderful things to do

The money raised for the Teenage Cancer Trusts will go towards funding new teenage cancer units at seven NHS hospitals as well as creating Stephen Sutton scholarships for Coventry University's Postgraduate Certificate in Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Care.

The scholarships have been set up in recognition of Stephen's ambition to pursue a medical career.

He will also now be recognised posthumously with an honorary degree from Coventry University.

David Cameron and comedian Jason Manford were among the supporters of his fundraising campaign.

Stephen's campaign generated a lot of interest and he was visited by the Prime Minister, David Cameron 

Stephen was known for his fun approach to life and his determination to helping others. Before he died he said: 'I don't see the point in measuring life in terms of time any more.'I'd rather measure life in terms of making a difference.'

More than 7,000 people attended at two day vigil at Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire to remember the teenager. Dozens donned yellow ribbons and gave a 'thumbs up' to his coffin that became synonymous with the teenager's campaign. 

Coventry University said the honorary degree will be accepted by Stephen's mother, Jane Sutton, in a ceremony at Coventry Cathedral on November 18. 

In the same week, the university will award honorary doctorates to a number of other individuals, including film director Ken Loach, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and former Sainsbury's chief Justin King. 

Stephen's ambition to drum in front of a large crowd was achieved when he played before 90,000 at Wembley

The university's vice-chancellor, John Latham, said: 'Our honorary graduates have all excelled in or contributed to their respective fields in a way that deserves the utmost respect and admiration, so it is a pleasure to be commending them alongside our own graduands during the graduation ceremonies next week.

'I hope our students will be inspired by the passion and perseverance of these individuals as they embark on their own careers.

'Stephen's commendation is particularly fitting, not only in light of his wish to pursue a medical career, but also coming soon after the Teenage Cancer Trust announced it would be using part of the money he raised to fund scholarships for professionals to train at Coventry University. We're delighted to be supporting Stephen's legacy in this way.'
