The nights may be getting longer, but nature is putting on a spectacular display to brighten the days.

At Raby Castle in County Durham yesterday, vivid reds, greens and golds lit up the horizon, with the only glimpse of grey coming from the stone battlements of the 14th century fortress.

And 300 miles away, near Glastonbury, the day began with an extraordinary yellow-gold wave of mist swirling across the Somerset Levels. Only the tallest trees could be glimpsed through the foggy veil as the sun came up.

Season of mists: The turrets of Raby Castle rise above the autumnal colours of the surrounding woodland of County Durham

Stunning: These incredible images show an extraordinary wave of early morning mist sweeping across the Somerset Levels. Houses are shrouded in fog as Glastonbury Tor in the distance and the tallest trees peep up through the thick white blanket

Mystical: Houses in Somerset are shrouded in thick fog showing that autumn is well and truly in full swing

Other worldly: The breathtaking images of fog in the Somerset Levels were taken by keen photographer Stephen Spraggon, who captured the autumnal scenes 15 miles away at the top of Crook Peak in the Mendip Hills

Those who want to witness autumn’s majesty for themselves may want to be quick.

Last month was one of the mildest 
Octobers since records began in 1910, the Met Office said last night – 
but temperatures will plunge from Friday, with frosts fading the 
colourful scenes.

With homes shrouded in thick fog and the mystical 
Glastonbury Tor peeping up, these incredible images show how autumn is 
bringing out the best in Britain's countryside.

The mini-heatwave which the country has 
enjoyed recently has led to one of the most glorious autumns ever seen.

And
with the end of British Summer Time yesterday, photographers have 
captured some amazingly vivid sunrises to greet those up early 
enough to catch them.

Keen photographer Stephen Spraggon took these breathtaking early morning pictures of fog in the Somerset Levels from 15 miles away in the Mendip Hills.

Dramatic: A burst of autumnal hue at the Queen Elizabeth Country Park makes a stunning backdrop for these weekend walkers at Butser Hill near Petersfield in Hampshire

And despite the east coast of America
currently being battered by snow storms, it looks like we could be set 
for more beautiful autumnal scenes as the week progresses.

As one of the warmest Octobers on 
record draws to a close, the balmy weather is set to continue, with temperatures up to 64F (18C).

Although
October began with a burst of extraordinarily warm weather, a lack of 
sunshine and extensive cloud cover has kept temperatures from hitting 
record highs.

However, 
the month was unusually mild, with minimum temperatures often 
hovering around 55F (13C), compared to usual minimum temperatures of 46F
(8C).

Current figures have the month as the
seventh warmest October since records began, and with unseasonably warm
nights across the south-east it could sneak in to the top five.

Last of the summer time: This amazing late sunrise was snapped near Bowes in County Durham

Standing out: Barnard Castle in County Durham stands proud against the rising sun on the last day of British Summer Time

Today South 63F (17C), North 61F (16C)

Tomorrow: South 61F (16C), North 57F (16C)

These conditions will continue into the start of November, with little sunshine but no prospect of extreme weather conditions this week - a major boon for those celebrating Halloween and Bonfire Night.

And fans of the old tradition of apple bobbing, which is often popular at this time of year, will be delighted by news that scientists have discovered the perfect bobbing apple.

Researchers claim that Zari apples are just the right size and shape to be picked out of water without using hands - and this week were testing the theory with a mass bobbing event in London's Bloomsbury Square.

Experiment: Dozens of people took part in an event to test what the perfect apple for bobbing is - scientists claim the Zari apple is best
