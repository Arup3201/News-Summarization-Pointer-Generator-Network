The National 
Institutes of Health said it has uncovered a nearly century-old 
container of ricin and a handful of other forgotten samples of dangerous
 pathogens as it combs its laboratories for improperly stored hazardous 
materials.

The agency began an intensive 
investigation of all its facilities after a scientist in July found 
vials of smallpox dating from the 1950s, along with other contagious 
viruses and bacteria that had been stored and forgotten in one lab on 
the NIH's campus.

Friday, the NIH said in 
different facilities, it found small amounts of five improperly stored 'select agents,' pathogens that must be registered and kept only in 
certain highly regulated laboratories.

The National Institutes of Health has found a container of ricin and other forgotten samples of dangerous pathogens lost in its facilities for nearly a century

All were found in sealed and 
intact containers, with no evidence that they posed a safety risk to 
anyone in the labs or surrounding areas, the agency said in a memo to 
employees.

All have been destroyed.

They 
included a bottle of ricin, a highly poisonous toxin, found in a box 
with microbes dating from 1914 and thought to be 85 to 100 years old, 
the memo said.

The bottle was labeled as originally containing 5 grams, 
although NIH doesn't know how much was left.

Ricin has legitimate research uses, the NIH said, but was not studied in this lab.

Also
 discovered were samples listing pathogens that cause botulism, plague, 
tularemia and a rare tropical infection called melioidosis.

The
 NIH does have laboratories that are cleared to use select agents, and 
those pathogens are regularly inventoried, said NIH director of research
 services Dr. Alfred Johnson, who oversees agency security and safety 
issues.

Ricin, an incredibly dangerous poison, is derived from this castor oil plant, known as Ricinus communis

But these samples were in different 
labs, mostly in historical collections that scientists once routinely 
kept in the backs of freezers or on dusty shelves but that today require
 special handling.

'NIH takes this matter very
 seriously. The finding of these agents highlights the need for constant
 vigilance in monitoring laboratory materials in compliance with federal
 regulations on biosafety,' the agency memo said.

Separately
 Friday, the Food and Drug Administration reported it had found still 
another improperly stored pathogen in one of its laboratories - 
staphylococcus enterotoxin that can cause food poisoning.

The vials were
 in a locked freezer but not in a lab registered to work with select 
agents.

They were relocated to a registered lab, and later destroyed, 
FDA said.
