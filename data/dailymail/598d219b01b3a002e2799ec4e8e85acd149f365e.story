Chase: According to police, the transgender girl (left) hit another girl, who chased her and began a brawl (right)

According to police, a male student who identifies as female hit a female student outside at the school. That girl and two others then chased and began fighting with the transgender student.

All four students were suspended but according to board member Charles Ramsey, two have since returned to school.

The Bay Area Reporter says that two of the students have indicated to police that they want to press charges for battery against the transgender teen.

For her part, the transgender teen wants to press charges against the two girls who attacked her. She also indicated that she wants to transfer out of Hercules High School because 'the harrassment is too much.'

'The board takes this very seriously, and we are not going to sit idly by and let these activities take place,' Ramsey said.

'We want parents and families to know that we have safe campuses.'

While the fight involved a transgender student, police did not find any evidence that the fight was a hate crime, Hercules police Detective Connie Van Putten told KTVU.

Bullying: The fight was reportedly sparked by ongoing harassment against a 16-year-old transgender student by a group of girls

Despite this, the transgender teen reported being bullied by two of the girls previously.

'It's not about the transgender issue,' Adam Taylor, executive director of K-12 Schools at the West Contra Costa Unified School District told the Bay Area Reporter.

'It's really about friendships or allegiances that kids see.'

According to the Bay Area Times, the school district has an anti-harassment policy in place but it does not address sexual orientation or gender identity.
