When 13-year-old Greg Hofmann opened his presents on Christmas Day, he was stunned to find his parents had finally taken his many hints and bought him an iPhone.

Yet he was also surprised to see that it came with an 18-point set of terms and conditions - not from the phone company, but from his mother.

'Merry Christmas!' The agreement began. 'You are now the proud owner of an iPhone. Hot Damn! You are a good & responsible 13 year old boy and you deserve this gift. But with the acceptance of this present comes rules and regulations.'

Precautions: Janelle Hofmann, right, attached an 18-point list of rules to an iPhone she gave her 13-year-old son Greg, left, for Christmas. They included where and when he could use the device

What followed were 18 rules the teenager, who lives in Cape Cod, Massachusetts with his parents and four younger siblings, had to promise to keep if he didn't want to lose the device.

They instructed him never to use the phone to view porn, to leave it at home when he went to school, - and never to ignore a call when the screen read 'Mom' or 'Dad'.

Others were more lighthearted - telling him to use the phone to play brain teaser games, to download music none of his friends were listening to and to 'wonder without Googling'.

The teenager laughed as he recounted his shock at the rules attached to his gift.

Surprise: Greg, the oldest of Janelle's five children, said he was shocked when he saw the list

Staying in control: The rules also included 'no porn' and no texting pictures of his 'private parts'

'Oh my God. My first reaction was, "Why? Why did she really have to do this?"' Hoffman told Good Morning America.

His mother, writer Janell Hofmann, added: 'What I wanted to do and show him [is] 
how you could be a responsible user of technology without abusing it, 
without becoming addicted.'

She added that she wanted her son to avoid the pitfalls that many smart phone users fall prey to.

'I hope that you understand it is my job to raise you into a well rounded, healthy young man that can function in the world and coexist with technology, not be ruled by it,' she wrote at the start of the list.

Rule number seven instructed: 'Do not use this technology to lie, 
fool, or deceive another human being. Be a good 
friend first or stay the hell out of the crossfire.'

Other rules said that he was not allowed to send or receive 'pictures of your private parts or anyone else's private parts' - a rule he may laugh at now, but which he may be tempted to break in the future, she said, adding: 'It is risky and could ruin your 
teenage/college/adult life.'

The list also emphasised Greg should not rely on his phone as his only way as communication.

'It does not go to school with you,' rule 5 read. 'Have a conversation with the 
people you text in person. It's a life skill.'

'Turn it off, silence it, put it away in public,' Rule 11 added. Especially in a 
restaurant, at the movies, or while speaking with another human being. 
You are not a rude person; do not allow the iPhone to change that.'

And it also told him that, if he lost or broke the phone, he would be paying the costs of repairing or replacing it. 'Mow a
 lawn, babysit, stash some birthday money', it said.

Teenage behavior expert Josh Shipp added to GMA that the set of rules for the iPhone made sense.

'You wouldn't give your kid a car 
without making sure they had insurance,' he said. 'And so giving them a 
cell phone or a computer without teaching them how to use it responsibly
 is irresponsible on the part of the parent.'

Speaking to GMA, Janelle said the list was meant to be light-hearted while also pointing out that serious issues could emerge from misusing the phone.

'I love you madly & look forward to sharing several million text messages with you in the days to come,' the agreement concluded.

1. It is my phone. I bought it. I pay for it. I am loaning it to you. Aren't I the greatest?

2. I will always know the password.

3. If it rings, answer it. It is a 
phone. Say hello, use your manners. Do not ever ignore a phone call if 
the screen reads "Mom" or "Dad". Not ever.

4. Hand the phone to one of your parents promptly at 7:30pm every school
 night & every weekend night at 9:00pm. It will be shut off for the 
night and turned on again at 7:30am. If you would not make a call to 
someone's land line, wherein their parents may answer first, then do not
 call or text. Listen to those instincts and respect other families like
 we would like to be respected.

5. It does not go to school with you. Have a conversation with the 
people you text in person. It's a life skill. *Half days, field trips 
and after school activities will require special consideration.

6. If it falls into the toilet, smashes on the ground, or vanishes into 
thin air, you are responsible for the replacement costs or repairs. Mow a
 lawn, babysit, stash some birthday money. It will happen, you should be
 prepared.

7. Do not use this technology to lie, fool, or deceive another human 
being. Do not involve yourself in conversations that are hurtful to 
others. Be a good friend first or stay the hell out of the crossfire.

8. Do not text, email, or say anything through this device you would not say in person.

9. Do not text, email, or say anything to someone that you would not say
 out loud with their parents in the room. Censor yourself.

10. No porn. Search the web for information you would openly share with 
me. If you have a question about anything, ask a person - preferably me 
or your father.

11. Turn it off, silence it, put it away in public. Especially in a 
restaurant, at the movies, or while speaking with another human being. 
You are not a rude person; do not allow the iPhone to change that.

12. Do not send or receive pictures of your private parts or anyone 
else's private parts. Don't laugh. Someday you will be tempted to do 
this despite your high intelligence. It is risky and could ruin your 
teenage/college/adult life. It is always a bad idea. Cyberspace is vast 
and more powerful than you. And it is hard to make anything of this 
magnitude disappear -- including a bad reputation.

13. Don't take a zillion pictures and videos. There is no need to 
document everything. Live your experiences. They will be stored in your 
memory for eternity.

14. Leave your phone home sometimes and feel safe and secure in that 
decision. It is not alive or an extension of you. Learn to live without 
it. Be bigger and more powerful than FOMO -- fear of missing out.

15. Download music that is new or classic or different than the millions
 of your peers that listen to the same exact stuff. Your generation has 
access to music like never before in history. Take advantage of that 
gift. Expand your horizons.

16. Play a game with words or puzzles or brain teasers every now and then.

17. Keep your eyes up. See the world happening around you. Stare out a 
window. Listen to the birds. Take a walk. Talk to a stranger. Wonder 
without googling.

18. You will mess up. I will take away your phone. We will sit down and 
talk about it. We will start over again. You & I, we are always 
learning. I am on your team. We are in this together.
