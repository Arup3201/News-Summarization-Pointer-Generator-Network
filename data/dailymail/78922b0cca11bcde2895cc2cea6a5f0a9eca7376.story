These pictures show the incredible sculptures carved from egg shells by Chinese artist Wen Fuliang

Wen, of Shaanxi province, was laid off from his job as a wood carver and turned to the unusual and skillful form of art to make ends meet.

He uses chicken, goose and duck eggshells to carve out places of interest, such as the iconic Dayan Pagoda in Xi'an.

Detail: The artist displays his incredible work using a magnifying glass

Wen Fuliang has practiced eggshell carving for more than ten years.

Egg carving is done using a fine diamond bit on an electric rotary tool. The artist sketches a design on the shell, which has been carefully emptied of the yolk and egg white with a syringe.

They must then gently but securely hold the egg shell in one hand, the rotary tool in the other and slowly carve away the design in an incredibly time-consuming and skillful process.

Fragile beauty: Mr Wen's art often contains landmarks, such as the Dayan Pagoda in the city of Xi'an

Artistry: This sculpture contains a brown egg shell within a white egg shell

Gentle: Each design is carefully mapped out using a pencil before carving begins

Sculpture: Mr Wen has been carving egg shells for 10 years. He turned to his hobby to make a living after being made redundant
