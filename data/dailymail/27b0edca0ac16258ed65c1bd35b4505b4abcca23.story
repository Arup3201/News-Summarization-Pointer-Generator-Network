The secret behind Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci's wonder-strike against Roma on Sunday has been revealed - as the Italian was given 'garlic sweets' before the game.

Alberto Ferrarini, Bonucci's motivational coach, said he gave the 27-year-old sweets on Saturday night, to help him 'return to his origins'.

And, in a bizarre twist, Ferrarini told him to breathe on the Roma strikers to put the Roma forwards off their game.

'On Saturday night we spent three hours in the hotel to prepare for the game,' Ferrarini told Italian paper Tuttosport.

'Any new secrets? When we finished our work I gave Leonardo some garlic sweets. Natural products, inedible.

'The soldiers of hundreds of years ago ate garlic to remain strong, healthy and lucid in battle. Leo is a soldier, and eating the sweets is as if he is returning to those origins.

'I told him to breathe in the face of Gervinho and Totti… The most important thing was to achieve the objective, to win.'

The plan seems to have worked, with Bonucci thundering home the winning goal from 20 yards four minutes from time. 

But Ferrarini was not happy with his player's response, when he suggested the strike had been the most important of his career.

But Totti scored Roma's first goal from the penalty spot and Gervinho provided the assist for the second 

'I am angry with Leo now,' continued Ferrarini. 'I do not want to hear him talk about the most important goal if his career as he did after the game.

'He has to stay focused, the most important goal will be the best one and that will always be so.

'New objectives? Forget Roma, to be more aware of his own strength and to have more hunger than the day before.'
