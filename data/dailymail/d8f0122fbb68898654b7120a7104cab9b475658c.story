Some brands of butter and supposedly ‘healthy’ spreads contain almost as much salt as seawater, a study shows.

Because of its high saturated fat content, butter is associated with health risks such as weight gain, clogged arteries and heart disease.

However, research by Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash), suggests the salt content of some spreads is also a concern.

Weight Watchers Dairy Spread contains 2.5g of salt per 100g which makes it as salty as seawater

Seven in ten salted butters would 
receive a red traffic light label for salt under guidelines drawn up by 
the Food Standards Agency (FSA).

Researchers found that fewer than four in ten spreads meet the Department of Health’s 2012 salt reduction targets.

The
study warned that labels can be confusing. It pointed to Marks & 
Spencer Softer Butter, which is described as ‘slightly salted’, but 
contains more than the chain’s Salted Farmhouse Butter.

The study found that ‘low fat’ spreads can be higher in salt than the full fat versions, while one was as salty as some oceans.

Some of the saltiest butters available are Country Life Butter (2g salt per 100g), Essential Waitrose Salted Dairy Butter (1.9g salt per 100g) and Anchor Butter (1.7g salt per 100g)

The
saltiest butter was found to be Country Life at 2g of salt per 100g, 
ahead of Essential Waitrose Salted Dairy Butter at 1.9g.

Among
margarines and spreads, the highest level was in Weight Watchers Dairy 
Spread at 2.5g salt per 100g – seawater is typically between 2.5 and 3.5
per cent salt.

Katharine
Jenner, campaign manager at Cash, warned: ‘Just one slice of buttered 
toast can contain more salt than a packet of crisps.’

Consumers
generally eat spreads in relatively small amounts but their salt intake
is boosted by eating processed foods such as bread and breakfast 
cereals.

High salt 
intake poses few health problems in the short term. But continued high 
consumption is linked to raised blood pressure and the greater risk of a
stroke and early death.

Britons
routinely consume more than the recommended maximum of 6g of salt a day
for adults, resulting in an extra 70,000 heart attacks and strokes each
year.

Graham MacGregor,
chairman of Cash and Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the 
Wolfson Institute, said: ‘It is a national scandal that there is still 
so much unnecessary salt in our food.

‘For
every one gramme reduction in salt intake, we can prevent 12,000 heart 
attacks, strokes and heart failures, half of which would have been 
fatal.

‘It is vital that the Department of Health ensures that manufacturers reduce the salt in these products immediately.’

Victoria
Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation, said: 
‘Shoppers clearly have to look twice when making the switch from butter 
to unsaturated spread.

‘Manufacturers
and supermarkets must cut back on the salt in their products so there 
is one less thing for shoppers to worry about.’

‘With so many varieties on offer, picking a healthy spread is confusing enough for consumers.

‘Manufactures
and supermarkets must cut back on the salt in their products so there 
is one less thing for shoppers to worry about.’

CASH has offered suggestions about how people can reduce their salt intake.

It
suggests that people opt for unsalted spreads and butters, that they 
think twice about diet spreads with less fat as they may contain more 
salt, that people reduce their butter and spread portions, and that 
people use olive oil when cooking instead of butter.
