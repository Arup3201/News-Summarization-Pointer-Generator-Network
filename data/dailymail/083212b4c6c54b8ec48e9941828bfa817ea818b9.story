When it launched in September, Tesco’s Hudl was the cheapest tablet on the market and it now seems the firm was unprepared for just how popular it would be.

According to reports, Tesco has run out of stock of its 7-inch tablet twice in the past two months and official figures claim the firm sold 35,000 models in the first 48 hours.

Nearly every colour model, other than purple, is shown as ‘currently unavailable’ on Tesco’s website, and a number of accessories aren’t available either.

This has raised fears customers may not be able to get hold of the cut-price gadget in time for Christmas.Yet, the company has dismissed claims that the shortfall is due to supply problems.

Treeva Fenwick, head of consumer and broadcast media, told MailOnline: 'Sales of Hudl have surpassed all expectations and we’re thrilled that customers like it.

'It is the fastest selling tablet we have sold at Tesco and we are working with our suppliers to get more in to meet demand.'

Michael Comish, Tesco’s chief digital officer, added 'they are flying off the shelves so quickly it’s twice run out of stock.'

The Hudl is manufactured by French company Archos. It has 16GB of built-in memory - the same as the iPad mini and Google’s £80 more expensive Nexus 7 - and can access the internet and stream music and movies as well as on-demand TV services from Tesco-owned Blinkbox.

It has front and rear-facing cameras, allowing users to talk face to face via Skype, too.

The device also features a ‘Tesco launcher’ button to access online grocery shopping and the supermarket chain’s other businesses including clothing, banking and mobile phone services.

Tesco bosses said the Hudl was aimed at families who could not afford higher priced tablets or who felt intimidated by existing technology.

It added at the launch that it had consulted customers before creating the tablet to make sure it was what they wanted.

Tesco's 7-inch Hudl, pictured, has a quad-core processor, 16GB of built-in storage, 2MP front- and 3MP rear-facing cameras and costs just £60 when bought with Clubcard Points. It comes in four colours - black, blue, purple and red - and according to Tesco.com, the purple model is the only tablet available at the moment

The tablet was pipped to be one of 
the best sellers in Christmas battle of the tablets. It was launched 
around the same time Argos announced its MyTablet for £99.99 and two 
months after Google unveiled its latest Nexus 7 tablet for £199.

It
will also compete with Amazon’s Kindle Fire HD, on offer at £159, as 
well as the retail giant’s new 7-inch Kindle Fire HDX, reduced from £199
to £169 for Cyber Monday.

Apple’s second-generation iPad mini was launched last month, and costs £319, but has a slightly larger 7.9-inch screen.

Tablets have proved hugely popular 
since the launch of the iPad three years ago and some forecasters have 
predicted they will overtake sales of traditional computers by the end 
of this year.

Three quarters of households still do not have one 
however.

Technology retailers have questioned 
whether cheaper alternatives can rival the popularity of the iPad. 
Sebastian James of Dixons said that, while there was a market for them, 
customers frequently expressed disappointment.

Speaking earlier this month, he said: 
‘We get a lot back because people use them and they say “No, what I 
wanted was an iPad” and they are not. There’s a reason why an iPad is 
more expensive, it’s just better.’
