File picture: Len Duvall, former chairman of the Met Police Authority

The son of a former police watchdog has been cleared over suspicions he looted a mobile phone shop during the recent riots.

Detectives raided the council flat home of Mark Duvall after someone claimed to recognise him in CCTV footage released by police.

He is the 25-year-old son of senior Labour politician Len Duvall, a London Assembly member and former head of the Metropolitan Police Authority.

But he was released with no further action after investigators interviewed him, searched his home and examined the original material.

The police raid took place in Woolwich, South-East London, where four generations of the Duvall family have lived and which Mr Duvall continues to represent.

The town centre was devastated as hundreds of hooded and masked rioters ran amok. There was widespread looting and a pub was razed to the ground.

Accused: Mark Duvall, son of London Assembly member Len Duvall

The arrest was embarrassing for the 
politician as it came just days after he called on the public to turn in
yobs who went on the rampage.

Mark Duvall denied taking part in 
looting and said he returned home after receiving a phone call from his 
father urging him to get off the streets.

Mr Duvall said: ‘This has been a very difficult time for me and my son.

‘It was always clear he had done 
nothing wrong, there was no evidence against him, and that he may have 
been the victim of a false, malicious allegation.

‘All he wants now is to put this behind him and get on with his life.’

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 
‘A 25-year-old man arrested on August 26 in connection with a burglary 
at a Vodafone shop in Woolwich has been released and no further action 
will be taken.’
