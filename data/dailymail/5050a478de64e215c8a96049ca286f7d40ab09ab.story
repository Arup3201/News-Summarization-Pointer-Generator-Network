Andy Peppers (a pseudonym) decided to squeeze a spot on his back that had been there for 20 years, after it became red, sore and covered in whiteheads

This is the revolting moment a man squeezes a spot on the back of his neck for the first time in 20 years.

Not for the squeamish, the video shows a torrent of white pus that had been blocked under the skin for two decades before being released.

However the Canadian man it belongs claims the process was not painful - and actually relieved the pressure in the spot.

Going under the pseudonym of Andy Peppers, he told MailOnline the spot finally became problematic while he and his wife were travelling through Laos, in south-east Asia. 

He said: 'The lump started to grow and it got to the point that it hurt for me just to tilt my head back because of all the pressure. 

'But we were in Laos, so we were quite apprehensive about going to any medical clinic - especially since we likely wouldn't be able to communicate with anyone.

'Then the lump started to form white-heads. Many, many white-heads. 

'Our frantic online research had us more or less convinced that this was basically a gigantic zit.

'We realised we needed to get this thing to "release".' 

Desperate to get rid of the pain, he asked wife to direct his hands where to squeeze, and she decided filmed the event so he could see it.

Mr Peppers explained: 'We got some gauze and alcohol and band-aids - a random assortment of normal first-aid stuff. 

The video, which Mr Peppers uploaded to Youtube, shows a painful looking open wound at the centre of a big lump, with red and inflamed skin surrounding it.

As his wife has just unblocked the pore with a pin, at first only clear liquid and blood is seen dripping out.

'At first, my wife used a pin to start a hole,' he explained. 

'Initially just a narrow stream of "stuff" came out, but the lump didn't really get any smaller. 

'Then, some of the multiple white-heads started to release.'

Mr Peppers squeezes with his fingers and a small amount of white pus becomes visible, coming through from two whiteheads.

As he applies more pressure, reams of white pus come shooting out suddenly, mixed with blood and oil.

After a long chain of pus is released, it seemed there was no more.

Appearing on the Oprah Winfrey show recently, Dr Mehmet Oz said the technique many of us adopt - pressing the healthy skin around the spot - actually damages it.

'The best way to pop a spot is to rip upwards'

Instead, he advises using a needle cleaned with alcohol.

This should be placed  parallel to the skin - rather like you would skewer something - and pierce the skin from one side to another.

'Then, rip UP,' Dr Oz advises. 'You only want to hit the white part of the pimple - because that bit is already dead,' he said.

Here, there is no sensation, but if you jab the needle in front ways, you will soon hit a part of the spot that isn't dead - and that will hurt.

The parallel technique also won't cause any damage to the surrounding, healthy skin, he said.

But an extra squeeze pushed out another snake-like amount of the white stuff, which curls into a sticky ball.

Mr Peppers, from Toronto, Canada, was left with a pea-sized amount of white pus, attached to his spot.

Pus in a white head is  formed of oil, dead cells, and bacteria.

Whiteheads form when the pores of the skin become clogged with oil and dead skin cells, forming a 'lid'.

The pore's oil secretions build up behind the blockage.

Bacteria that live in the pore feed of the secretions and grow, stimulating the body to send immune cells.

This is why the area around the spot is red and inflamed, as the immune system tries to kill the bacteria and heal the tissue.

Mr Peppers said the act of squeezing released pressure which made the lump less painful.

‘I definitely felt the pressure go way down, and it felt way better,’ he said.

‘And it didn't hurt while I was popping it - it just felt like pressure releasing.

‘Once a significant amount of stuff had come out, it felt way better, and soon stopped hurting altogether.’

He added that he and his wife carried out these spot-squeezing sessions two or three times a day for nearly a week – draining more pus each time.

‘Each time stuff would come out. Sometimes a lot - like A LOT,’ he said.

Although he still has the lump, it is barely noticeable now, he added.  

Mr Peppers asked his wife to unblock the pore with a pin, and as he squeezed white pus slowly came out

More and more white pus was ejected as he applied pressure, and eventually a long chain of the substance was ejected, which curled into a ball
