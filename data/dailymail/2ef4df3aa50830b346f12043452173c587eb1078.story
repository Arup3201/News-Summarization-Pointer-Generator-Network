A 29-year-old was the victim of a bomb hoax on Thursday, after a mystery caller, thought to be an angry ex-girlfriend, tipped off police that he had taken explosives on an airplane.

The anonymous caller claimed Christopher Shell was carrying 'dangerous substances' on board a US Airways Philadelphia-Dallas flight forcing it to make a u-turn mid-air.

At first believed to be a birthday prank, police and the airline took the allegation seriously and re-routed the plane, sending it back to Philadelphia International Airport, half an hour into the journey.

Emergency u-turn: Christopher Shell was removed from the craft while it was searched

Airport police received the bomb-scare call at around 7.30am claiming Shell was on his way to Texas, carrying a dangerous substance, and contacted the FBI.

The plane returned to Philadelphia where it was met by a slew of law enforcement vehicles and personnel.

Shell was led from the jet wearing 
handcuffs after the craft made its emergency return to Philadelphia 
International Airport on Thursday morning.

He was put him in the back of a police car and taken off for questioning, apparently very surprised to be caught up in the midst of the emergency.

'He was obviously very alarmed, as I would be if heavily armed police officers entered a plane to take me off,' Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Joseph 
Sullivan said.

Rant: Shell moaned about the flight on Facebook

'And he was certainly stunned. And that's why this is no joke, this is no laughing matter.'

Bomb technicians and specially trained dogs searched the plane but found nothing illegal or hazardous, Sullivan said.

Police believe the scare was a practical joke, played on Shell as he celebrated his 29th birthday, NBC reported.

Shell did nothing wrong and was the victim of 'a pretty nasty trick,' Sullivan said.

He made a swift recovery, however, taking to Facebook to offer up his story in exchange for cash.

'If u have questions or want an interview with me, it will cost u $$$ until then,' he wrote. 'Sry. Message me your offers as I'll go with the most $$$!'

Earlier on he had posted: 'Im not going to lie, I'm pretty disappointed in US Airways currently. We just spent a half hour in the air to be notified that the plane, "has technical difficulties" and had to fly back! Flight 1267 CANCELLED. Gay!'

Briefing: Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan talks about the threat after its investigation by police

Sullivan stressed that Shell is not a suspect but added that police are treating the hoax seriously because it had resulted in a heavy police response and a significant hassle for all those on board, he said.

'It's just an incredibly foolish and irresponsible thing to do and, bottom line, it's criminal,' Sullivan said.

Two people have since been taken into custody for questioning, according to NBC.

Earlier, an FBI spokesman said the flight was diverted because of a call reporting liquid explosives were on board. Sullivan declined to discuss the content of the call.

The airplane had 69 passengers and five crew members on board, airport spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said.

Sullivan said the investigation into the phone call had been turned over to the FBI.

FBI Special Agent Richard Quinn said it was too early to speculate about what sort of charges could be filed against the caller, but they could be severe.
