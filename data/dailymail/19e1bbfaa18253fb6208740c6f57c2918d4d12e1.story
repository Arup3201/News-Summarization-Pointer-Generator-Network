This delightful robin red breast plumps up his downy chest to protect himself from the worst of the winter weather.

The friendly little fellow joined millions of Britons struggling in the harsh conditions as he was pictured in chilly Llanberis, Snowdonia.

The area has seen almost a foot of snow fall over the past 24 hours and with many parts of Britain already under a thick blanket of white forecasters say there is more to come.

The Met Office is forecasting less 
snow today but has issued yellow warnings for ice over much of the 
country. The Highways Agency said its fleet of snow ploughs and gritters
will continue to be out in force across the weekend to ensure roads are
passable.

Temperatures are likely to remain low
- down to about -3C (37.4F), and ice is expected to form on any 
untreated roads.By last night, motorways were impassable, airports had 
shut  down, schools closed their doors and roads were gridlocked as 
Britain ground to a chilly halt.

Ten inches (25cm) of snow were 
recorded in parts of Wales, while around 3.5in (9cm) fell in parts of 
the Midlands and Wiltshire and 3in (7.5cm) was recorded at Northolt in 
north-west London.

Forecaster Gemma Plumb of MeteoGroup said snow had come in 'from all directions' overnight, with strong winds in the South West and Wales causing 'blizzard conditions'.

And the AA advised that the combination of compacting snow and continued icy temperatures could prove  lethal for drivers. 'We're likely to see treacherous driving conditions throughout the weekend and any fresh snow on top will just add to the problems,' a spokesman warned.

Met Office chief forecaster Frank Saunders said: 'Although some further snowfalls are likely, the focus switches to ice, with temperatures staying below zero over snow cover for many areas.'
