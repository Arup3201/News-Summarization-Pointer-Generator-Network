A Home Office minister was forced to make a humiliating apology  for what critics branded ‘a national embarrassment‘ after the UK’s main immigration computer crashed causing chaos air passengers.

The 12-hour computer glitch forced passengers at airports across Britain to queue for up to four hours to get into the country as passport control staff were forced to process arrivals manually when they were no longer able to electronically scan their documents.

Border Force staff called in back-up police on 999 emergency duty to Luton Airport amid reports of fighting among ‘angry and frustrated’ passengers in the main hall though no arrests were made.

There were also reports of fights breaking out at Gatwick Airport as passengers were stuck for up to four hours in queues and took to Twitter to vent their frustration about queues stretching ‘for miles’.

Furious travellers described the scenes as ‘a disgrace and a national embarrassment’ with many complaining about a lack of information and water.

As the Government launched an investigation into the cause of the computer meltdown, Immigration and security minister James Brokenshire apologised for the fiasco on a visit to Heathrow.

He said: ‘Our engineers have been working through the night to fix the temporary IT problems and all ports are now functioning normally.

‘We apologise for the delays that some passengers experienced at passport controls yesterday, but security must remain our priority at all times.’

He added: ‘I visited Heathrow early this morning and have asked technical staff to continue to look into the incident to ensure lessons are learnt.’

Although non-EU passengers endured the brunt of the delays, it also caused waits of more than two hours of delay for UK citizens.

Problems on the UK’s immigration computer network began at airports and seaports around the country at about 2.30pm and quickly escalated over the next 12 hours. But it took Border Force until around 3am Thursday to install an electronic ‘patch’ to solve the damaging software failure.

Eye-witness passengers said Border Force staff had told them that - with the electronic scans down - Home Secretary Theresa May had vetoed a switch to old style visual passport checks for UK and EU citizens and insisted that data be inputted manually, which added to delays.

Passenger Simon Kalman, 56, from Golders’ Green in London told BBC Radio 5 Live how he had spent more than two hours at immigration with 2,000 other passengers after arriving late last night from Barcelona on an EasyJet flight.

He said: ‘There was a bit of a punch up. It was organised chaos.’ ‘The Border force officers were trying their best. But as I understand it, having spoken to a chief officer, they had been almost pleading to just visually scan passports for UK and EU nationals so they didn’t have to input the information. But that was denied them.

‘As a result, they had to input manually your name, date-of-birth and passport number and wait and see what came up. on their screen, which of course took an incredibly long time to process.’

Mr Kalman said: ‘Queues were long. People waited in excess of three hours. There was a lack of information to waiting passengers.’ ‘It was a total mess, there was limited water available and people were getting very frustrated.

‘There were heavily pregnant women, young children and babies.’

Another stricken passenger called Phil arriving at Luton from Paris told Radio 5 live at 1am:’It was bedlam. It was more than a glitch. That’s government spin.’

Josh Bone captured an image of the Luton chaos at 1am in a photograph showing hundreds in line with the caption: ‘Sort it out’.

Bedfordshire Police confirmed they had been called to Luton Airport at around midnight specifically following a request by the Border Force to prevent ‘a breach of the peace.’

A police spokeswoman said: ‘We went down there because people were quite frustrated and angry. The Border Force called them in. They were concerned people were getting angry.

'There were about 800 people. They were a 999 response team. We sent people up there as a precaution to make sure there was no breach of the peace. No-one was arrested and no-one came forward as an assault victim.’

Elsewhere Passenger Kay Perry tweeted: ‘Gatwick airport chaos. Fights break out among passengers as queues reach for miles.’

And a passenger who had just arrived at Heathrow said: ‘This immigration queue is a disgrace and is becoming a national embarrassment.’

Another passenger mocked the airport, posting: ‘Well done Heathrow airport. I’ve spent longer in thus immigration queue than in the air.’ The computer glitch is the latest humiliation for the Home

Office’s beleaguered UK Border Force - and the biggest disaster since the widespread queue chaos before the 2012 Olympics.

Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton said the problems had been resolved.
