The growing use of the word ‘fit’ to describe attractiveness is putting girls off sport and exercise, according to a girls’ school leader.

Children should stop using it to mean ‘fanciable’ because it can lead to girls feeling self-conscious about their appearance while exercising, says Helen Fraser. 

Girls should be able to get ‘pink in the face and tousled’ without worrying about whether they were having a ‘bad hair day’.

Mrs Fraser, chief executive of the Girls’ Day School Trust (GDST), believes girls should be concerned about their running speed instead of worrying ‘does my bum look big in this?’.

In a speech to the trust’s annual conference today, Mrs Fraser will say: ‘What on earth has happened to the word fit, which used to mean that you could run a few miles without collapsing but now just means “fanciable”?

‘I think sport and exercise is one of the ways in which women can reclaim their bodies from the kind of obsessions of the tabloid press and celebrity magazines.

‘It is not about being fat or thin, it is about being fit. It is not about how you look, but about what you do.’

She will add: ‘Really great inclusive sport takes girls away from all those unhelpful thoughts of bodily perfection and focuses them on the team and the goals.

‘I have been in our schools when a class of teenage girls is returning from a sports lesson, pink in the face, tousled, throwing themselves down on the floor – with never a moment of “am I having a bad hair day”, or “does my bum look big in this”.’

Mrs Fraser will also urge schools to impress upon girls the importance of sport ‘more forcefully’. 

By the age of eight or nine, girls are already less active than boys and by the time they are 14, only 12 per cent of girls are as active as they should be. 

Mrs Fraser will highlight a lack of ‘cultural representations of women and girls who are physically powerful, fast and strong’. 

She will also criticise different treatment of the sexes in professional sport, with sponsorship and media attention skewed in favour of men.

‘Women’s football and women’s cricket gets less funding, less media attention,’ she says. ‘A Premier League boss sends sexist emails. Newspapers print allegations that Jessica Ennis is fat (that was before she won her gold medal),’ she will say.

She will point out that many successful women have a strong sporting past including Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, who was a member of the French national synchronised swimming team, and Condoleezza Rice, the former US Secretary of State, who is an accomplished golfer.

‘It is important to have cultural representations of women and girls who are physically powerful, and fast and strong,’ she says.

The GDST – which runs 24 private and two state academies  – has attempted to create a culture of ‘sport for all’ with classes in Zumba and tai chi as well as traditional team games.
