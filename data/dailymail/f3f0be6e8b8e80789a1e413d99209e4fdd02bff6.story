A police officer shot dead a beloved family dog and then called the killing 'awesome', the animal's family has claimed.

Sarah Brown, from Ardmore, Oklahoma, said she is devastated after her beloved pit bull Cali was gunned down by officer Brice Woolley after it hopped over their garden fence last Wednesday.

Other members of the community are now joining her as she calls for justice and demands the officer to be fired.

Officers with the Ardmore Police Department said they had received several complaints about the dog acting aggressively and headed to the scene, arriving before animal control.

Killed: Images show the deadly wounds suffered by the dog after she was shot near to her Oklahoma home

According to a Facebook group set up in support for the slain animal, Woolley said, 'I'm not waiting for animal control', pulled out a shotgun and shot the dog through the neck, killing her.

'She had done nothing to provoke the office,' the page said. 'She died immediately.'

Brown, who did not witness the incident, added to KFOR: 'He turned back to the animal control 
officer and said, "Did you see the way her collar flew into the air when I blew her head off? That was awesome".'

Woolley informed the animal control that 
he had shot the dog, adding: 'We'll just write in the report that she 
tried to attack you and others in the neighborhood', according to 
witnesses.

She said that her dog was never aggressive and was gentle around her young children, including a baby. But like other animals, Cali was territorial in her own yard, she said.

'I cried so much,' Brown said of her death. 'I knew this was totally unjust. Cali was family and it's not funny.'

As well as the Facebook group, a Change petition has been created to raise awareness of the story and to seek justice for Cali. It has already received more than 17,000 signatures.

Many of the visitors are demanding the officer lose his job.

Cpt. Eric Hamblin told KFOR that Officer Woolley has received death threats about the incident, but that a review of the incident showed he acted according to protocol.

Support: Police Captain Eric Hamblin, right, said officer Brice Woolley had acted appropriately

'I don't think it's wise for police department to wait for a dog acting aggressively actually bites somebody,' he said.

The police report added: 'It was determined that the dog had to be euthanized for the safety of the nearby park and neighborhood as the dogâ€™s owner could not be located, nor could it be captured.'

Brown argued that her neighbors have never complained to her about her dog being aggressive.

The officer continues to work pending the outcome of an investigation, police said.
