The space shuttle Enterprise -
named after the spaceship in Star Trek - floated past the Statue
of Liberty and One World Trade Center on a barge on Wednesday and docked near its new home
at a museum on New York's Hudson River.

Crowds of people turned out to see the retired spacecraft
make its final approach to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum
where it was placed on display atop the World War II aircraft
carrier USS Intrepid.

For a shuttle that never made it into space, Enterprise has had quite a journey. In April, hundreds of tourists and New Yorkers watched in awe as Enterprise flew over the city piggy-backed on a Boeing 747 Jumbo jet.

However, despite never flying in space, Enterprise holds a special place in American history having been the first of NASA's space shuttles.

In 1977 it was used for a series of approach and landing tests during a nine-month period.

Enterprise was originally to be named Constitution in honor of the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution.

However, a fierce letter-writing campaign by Star Trek fans convinced White House officials to rename the shuttle Enterprise after the fictitious spaceship that Captain Kirk and Mr Spock flew to the frontlines of an intergalactic battle with the Klingons on the popular TV show.

Experts say Enterprise captured the hearts and minds of many by embodying the best of American ingenuity.

In April last year NASA announced it would retire its space shuttle fleet to locations in New York, Virginia, California and Florida.
