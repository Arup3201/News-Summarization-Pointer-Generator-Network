Diana Vazquez, the teen's mother, told KVUE-TV that her son called her Tuesday morning and said he was sick and asked if she would write let him leave school. She told him no.

His last words to her were: 'I love you mom. She responded: 'I love you too.'

The name of the 17-year-old who took his own life was not revealed by school authorities

She said she had no idea that her son was suicidal. She said she wishes someone would have paid more attention to her son and picked up on the fact that he was preparing to take his own life.

'I guess the thing was that no one took him seriously,' Vazquez told the TV station. 'They thought "no he's kidding. He's not. I don't think he'll do it."'

A lock-down was put in place on the school campus, according to a tweet from Superintendent Dr. Meria Carstarphen.

Mourning:  Diana Vazquez said someone should have been watching for warning signs that her son was suicidal

A school statement read: 'We are saddened by this tragic loss. Our thoughts are with the family.'

The
 superintendent informed parents of the tragic incident via emails and 
phone calls and told them they were free to come pick up their children 
from school.

Ms Carstarphen says counselors will be provided to meet with students.
