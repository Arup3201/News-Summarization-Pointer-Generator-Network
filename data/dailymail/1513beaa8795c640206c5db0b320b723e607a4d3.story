New Argentina coach Gerardo Martino has resisted making sweeping changes in naming his preliminary squad for next month's World Cup final rematch against Germany.

Martino replaced Alejandro Sabella last week and has stuck largely with the players who represented the Albiceleste at this summer's tournament in Brazil, where they finished runners-up to the Germans.

The likes of Barcelona team-mates Lionel Messi and Javier Mascherano are included in the squad of 20 European-based players, along with pending Manchester United signing Marcos Rojo.

Romero (Sampdoria), Andujar (Napoli); Zabaleta (Manchester City), Garay (Zenit St Petersburg), F Fernandez (Swansea), Rojo (Sporting), Demichelis (Manchester City), Campagnaro (Inter Milan), Basanta (Fiorentina); Mascherano (Barcelona), Biglia (Lazio), A Fernandez (Celta Vigo), Perez (Benfica), Alvarez (Internazionale), Di Maria (Real Madrid); Messi (Barcelona), Aguero (Manchester City), Higuain (Napoli), Lavezzi (Paris St Germain), Palacio (Inter Milan).
