Charlie Richardson, leader of the notorious 'Torture Gang', died in September 2012, but his last book is set to be released

One of London's most infamous gang leaders and rival to the Kray twins has revealed how he once bugged a Prime Minister and foiled a plot to expose 'saucy' pictures of Princess Margaret. 

Charlie Richardson, leader of the notorious 'Torture Gang', died in September 2012.

But his own account of how he rose to be one of the capital's most feared and dangerous underworld criminals is set to be released this week.

In it he claims that he helped a South African businessman bug the then British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson.

During a visit to Johannesburg Richardson writes that he helped with the plot to tap a phone conversation about a mining deal, so that he could bed the stunning wife of a South African spy by the name of Gordon Winter.

He writes that he found out who cleaned the Prime Minister's office and bribed them to plant the bug on the desk in a scheme that involved a 'a willing cleaner, a bugging device, and sticky tape.'

Richardson, a father of six, was one of the last of a generation of underworld faces from the 1960s who have passed into criminal folklore.

His trial at the Old Bailey shocked the nation, as details of how his gang tortured and intimidated their opposition were revealed in shocking detail.

While Richardson controlled large swathes of South London with his brother Eddie, the Kray twins held East London using similar techniques, and the gangs fought vicious turf wars.

The book - The Last Gangster: My Final Confession - also details how Richardson was approached by actor Richard Harris who asked the gangster to  ensure the 'safe receipt of some potentially saucy pictures involving the Queen's sister.'

The photographs had fallen into the hands of another actor, John Bindon, who also had links to the criminal underworld.

Richardson, a father of six, was one of the last of a generation of underworld faces from the 1960s who have passed into criminal folklore. These photos were issued by Thames Valley Police when he escaped from Springhill open prison in May 1980

Bindon was demanding Â£100,000 in exchange for the photos, but Richardson said that he persuaded him to take Â£5,000.

He said he handed over the Irish actor Mr Harris in a south London pub: 'I never knew the full contents of that envelope.

'My actor pal walked briskly to the fire and threw the envelope into the middle of the flames. 

'They were photographs, for sure, because I could see the outline of the prints as they twisted, turned and melted in the heat of the fire.'

He added: 'Within seconds the photos - and the secrets of a princess - were gone.'

Richardson was arrested on the day England won the World Cup in 1966 and his trial heard how he sought to extract information or money from his victims through, among other things, attaching electrodes to parts of their anatomy.

His gang were also claimed to have pinned victims to the floor with six inch nails and removed their toes with bolt cutters.

Richardson always denied the crimes and said the details were simply used to help jail his gang, adding that he was imprisoned 'for nothing'.

He received ten years for his part in the torture but became a minor celebrity in later life.

Richardson escaped from an open prison in 1980 and fled to France, but he was arrested and returned to jail before being allowed out on day release in 1984.

Following his release in 1984, Richardson sought to become a legitimate businessman, wrote his autobiography My Manor and had a cameo in a film of his life.
