A family branded the 'original neighbours from hell' was finally evicted from their council house today after 97 separate incidents of anti-social behaviour.

The four members of the Newell family abused, spat at and threatened to kill residents in Mountain Ash, South Wales, who put up with three years of 'total misery'.

A court heard the Newells made so much noise shouting and screaming that their next door neighbours had to watch television with subtitles.

Thrown out: After 97 complaints from neighbours the Newell family from Mountain Ash, South Wales, have finally been evicted from this house

People living nearby were left suffering from depression and nervous illnesses caused by the Newell family's behaviour.

PC Sian Weyman told magistrates: 'The effect the family was having on neighbours was immense.

'They have been exposed to years of continued noise, banging, shouting, screaming, swearing and recently threats.

'Neighbours have expressed concerns for their personal safety and for their property.'

The residents of the terraced house in Mountain Ash, South Wales, were named as 54-year-old Hilary Newell, her two adult sons Matthew Newell and Mark Pugh and her ex-husband David Newell.

Merthyr Tydfil magistrates heard police and Rhondda Cynon Taff Council had investigated 97 separate complaints.

The Newells were contacted 'on dozens of occasions' including warning letters, one-to-one meetings and interviews in an attempt to resolve the problems.

But the court yesterday made a premises closure order and said the family should be immediately evicted.

They were given until 4pm to remove their personal belongings before the property was boarded up.

One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'They were the original neighbours from hell.

'They never gave a thought to anyone else living here - they were trouble from start to finish.

'People's lives have been ruined by their awful behaviour - it has been total misery.

'I'm glad the court was tough with them because they've had enough chances.' David Jones, head of protection at Rhondda Cynon Taf Council, said: 'We worked tirelessly to resolve this issue for the benefit of the local community before resorting to this extreme measure.'Â
