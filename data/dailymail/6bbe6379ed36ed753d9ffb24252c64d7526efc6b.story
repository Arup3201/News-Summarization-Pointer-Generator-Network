The New Jersey woman who narrowly escaped death after her boyfriend's former partner put a hit out on her life says she still lives in fear.

Even after Nicole Faccenda, 45, was jailed in 2013 for 10 years for plotting her death, Jennifer, the girlfriend of Faccenda's ex-boyfriend, Howie, still cannot believe the lengths she was willing to go to.

Faccenda was arrested after a week-long ATF operation, in which she told federal agents posing as hitmen exactly what she wanted.

Victim: Nicole Faccenda tried to have Jennifer, who is pictured but hasn't revealed her surname, killed by hitmen

Apologized: Nicole Faccenda, 45, of New Jersey, has publicly said sorry to the woman she tried to have murdered, after being caught in an undercover sting in 2011

'Everywhere I go, I have to be worried or concerned that somebody is going to drive me off the road, or somebody is going to come to my door with a silencer, as she said she wanted to,' Jennifer told ABC News' 20/20 exclusively.

'I'm scared every day.'

Incredibly Jennifer and Howie are trying to salvage their relationship after the terrifying revelations.

Nicole Faccenda interaction with the officer was all recorded and makes chilling viewing,

'I've played every scenario through 
my head a million times. Do I want the car to go off the highway? Do I 
want someone to just come up and take her out? Do I want me to just go 
into the house with my silencer and take them all out?' she was recorded
 telling the agents.

'I wouldn't care if she was in a horrible, horrible, horrible car accident and mangled up,' said the suburban soccer mom.

Jennifer became aware of the heinous plot when she was pulled over by federal agents.

'He
 shows me the badge, and he says to me, "Jennifer there’s been a hit put
 on your life." And immediately I said to him, "Nicole Faccenda,"' 
Jennifer told ABC News. 'And he said, "Yes."'

The
 agent told her that she was scheduled to die that morning, and that 
they needed to make it appear as if Faccenda had succeeded.

Terrifying: Faccenda said that if Jennifer's children got in the way, 'Oh well, I'm sorry'

'I never thought that she would go to
 the extent as she did... to try to find somebody to murder me and my 
family,' Jennifer told 20/20. 

'Every
 day I live in fear because of her, and that’s not the way I wanted to 
live. She chose that for me.'

Indeed, Faccenda didn't mince words.

'I
 want to go to her funeral and spit in the casket. I will be happiest 
when this woman is dead and buried and six-feet-under,' she told agents,
 in effect digging her own grave.

She was introduced to a man she thought was a killer in the parking lot of a
 Mahwah, New Jersey, supermarket, however the man was an undercover officer 
with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- the ATF.

Stung: This is the moment Nicole Faccenda first met with whom she believed to be a hit man, in the carpark of a supermarket in Manwah. The man was an undercover officer and the meeting was being filmed and recorded

Suspcious: This footage, taken inside the car by an undercover cop, shows Nicole Faccenda looking directly at the camera that was secretly filming her. She also refused to discuss the murder-for-hire explicity, saying: 'I want to wear black.'

While all there meetings were being 
secretly recorded, Faccenda was suspicious the man may have been an 
agent, refusing to explicitly say she wanted the woman dead, saying she 
has 'watched too many Lifetime movies'.

She
 used turns of phrase like she 'wants to be dressed in black', referring
 to a funeral, and wanted the new girlfriend 'gone to the moon'.

However,
 after a few phone conversations Faccenda inevitably let her guard down,
 and she soon handed over a $2,000 down payment with the promise of 
another $18,000 when the woman was dead and she could go to her funeral 
and 'p--- on her grave'.

She also provided a picture of the intended target, along with her address.

As
 for her ex-boyfriend, she said she didn't want him killed, but it would
 be all right for the hit man to shoot him in the foot.

She had less concern for the other woman's children. If they got in the way, she said: 'Oh well, I'm sorry.'

Faccenda was arrested after the week-long ATF operation.

She later pleaded guilty and, in December 2013, was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

She spoke openly about her crime and sent a series of emails to ABC about why she did it.

Faccenda hopes that, by speaking out, she may be able to help other women from landing in the same position.

'My
 message to any woman who has had her heart broken and has felt the pain
 of loss in every bone in her body ... is to take a deep breath and 
think before speaking,' she said via email.

'Your words are powerful weapons and you will be held accountable for them and it is definitely not worth it.

'I
 know in my heart that if it were not for the persistence and constant 
pressure from the CI (Confidential Informant) and the ATF agents wanting
 to make their case, I would not be here today.

'I was at an emotional low point in my life and they took advantage of that.

However Faccenda goes on to say she takes responsibility for her actions.

'I thank God every day that no one got hurt from my careless actions,' she wrote.

'I will be indebted to my family and friends for their support. I would like to apologize to the victim and her family.

'I am not  - and have never been - a violent person. I was a woman destroyed by emotions and I am paying for it dearly.'
