These mind-bending 3-D artworks are sure to have hardcore arcade 'gamers' reminiscing about the good old days.

While many of the original old school games they take inspiration from may now be little more than collectors' items, these chalk pictures bring classics such as Space Invaders, Tetris, and Super Mario back to life with a colourful bang.

Inspired by classic 80s arcade games, American artist Chris Carlson, from Colorado, has spent up to 45 hours meticulously drawing his chalk creations, which take days of planning beforehand.

These mind-bending artworks of old school 80s games might look 3D, but in reality they are drawn on a wall with nothing more than chalk

American artist Chris Carlson, from Colorado, has spent up to 45 hours meticulously drawing his chalk creations, such as this one of a Nintendo Entertainment System hooked up to classic game 'Duck Hunt'

The 27-year-old discovered his love for art during a trip to Europe and has been working tirelessly to develop his skills ever since. Luckily, he already had his subject matter, having had a love of games such as Super Mario since he was a child

Mr Carlson, 27, discovered his 
love for art during a trip to Europe and has been working tirelessly to 
develop his skills ever since.

Mr Carlson said: 'The most difficult aspect is trying to keep a mental image of what the drawing will look like from the proper viewing angle at all times.

'When I am down on the ground drawing, I'm not paying too much attention to what the drawing looks like close up, I am thinking about what it will look like from the viewing point. 

'Producing work like mine can be hard on the body. At the end of the day my knees and back are usually quite sore.

The artist has taken inspiration from his own childhood favourites for his wall art. This old school bopper arcade game was huge hit 30 years ago

'My favorite thing about chalk art is the speed with which I can create large, detailed drawings.

'I also like the temporary nature of chalk art.

'I like the fact that these drawings can't be saved in a conventional way like paintings on a canvas.

Mr Carlson produces the 3D chalk art full time, creating custom drawings for promotional events and is commissioned by major brands regularly.

His favourite of his works is his ambitious Space Invaders project, a series of chalk drawings in homage to one of the original and best computer games

He said: 'My favorite drawing of my own right now is my Space Invaders project, because I feel the drawing creates a great sense of three dimensions by combining the wall and floor'

Taking inspiration from M.C Escher, Vincent Van Gogh and Tracy Lee Stum, Mr Carlson creates time-lapse videos to demonstrate the processes that he goes through when creating an artwork.

Mr Carlson has also sued more recent computer games such as Minecraft in his work

'My friends and family have all been very supportive and encouraging of my work. My parents give me lots of positive feedback and my friends give me lots of good ideas for drawings. 

'I really appreciate it when my friends give me constructive criticism. It's nice to be told that your work is good, but it's also important to learn how you can improve.'
