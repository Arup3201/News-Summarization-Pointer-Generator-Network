A family had a lucky escape after a 71-year-old driver lost control of his car and ploughed into the side of their house as they watched television.

Kerry Unsworth, 49, had been watching TV with her elderly mother when the motorist's blue Ford Focus smashed into her conservatory.

The mother-of-two said she thought there had been an explosion as the car struck her home in Droylsden, Greater Manchester yesterday afternoon.

Shock: Ms Unsworth said she thought there had been an explosion as the car hit her home

The 71-year-old driver is thought to have lost control of his automatic car as he approached the bend at the end of Ms Unsworth's street.

He then mounted the pavement and drove through a garden wall before the vehicle ended up crumpled against Ms Unsworth's extension.

His 73-year-old wife, a passenger in the car, had to be cut free by fire crews before being taken by ambulance to Tameside Hospital. Her injuries are not said to be life threatening and the driver was unhurt.

Ms Unsworth said the force of the impact was enough to shift her £9,000 conservatory more than three inches, and she fears it will have to be torn down.

Debris was also thrown onto the family car parked on the driveway whilst her two pet cats have disappeared. She fears they may have been traumatised and fled.

Ms Unsworth said it was mere chance that she was not in the conservatory at the time and described the whole ordeal as ‘very frightening’.

'I had just got up to get some washing out of the machine and it sounded like an explosion,' she said.

'It was really frightening. We sit in the conservatory all the time so it’s just lucky that this time we weren’t.

Prevention: Ms Unsworth is now calling for bollards to be put up to protect her house from further incidents

'Also if someone had been walking along the pavement at that point they would have taken them out. I went out and was looking after the lady until the paramedics arrived, she was my only concern at that point.

'But we’ve all been left really shaken up by it. I’m also angry as well because it’s a real mess.

'I think it’s going to take a few days to come to terms with it and get everything cleaned up.'

Ms Unsworth is now calling for bollards to be put up in front of her home to protect it from further incidents.

She said: 'There are bollards all around this bend other than in front of our house and with the number of crashes that happen here, something needs to be done before someone gets seriously hurt.'
