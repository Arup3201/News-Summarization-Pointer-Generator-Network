David Cameron was accused of being a ‘chicken’ tonight after leaving plans for televised leader debates in tatters by refusing to take part.

The Prime Minister said he would not sign up to a proposal from Britain’s main broadcasters for the TV debates unless it was changed to include the Green Party.

Mr Cameron’s refusal put the plans in chaos with growing doubts over whether the debates would take place, although there is still the possibility they could take place without him.

Nigel Farage and Ed Miliband last night accused Mr Cameron of being ‘chicken’ and ‘running scared’, while Nick Clegg said the PM was 'making excuses'.

The BBC, ITV, Sky News and Channel 4 had set-out plans that would have seen Ukip leader Mr Farage invited to take part in one debate also featuring David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg.

The Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem leaders would have then taken part in a three-way discussion, before Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband went head-to-head in a final clash.

When asked if it was correct that would not take part as it stands, Mr Cameron told ITV News: ‘Correct.’

Mr Miliband seized on the response to accuse Mr Cameron of dodging the debates.

‘The Prime Minister should be able to stand on his record and stop running scared,’ the Labour leader said.

Mr Farage added: ‘Looks like Mr Cameron is a chicken running scared over the TV debates.’

Mr Cameron is not thought to have been happy with Mr Farage’s inclusion in the debate, while being eager for Green leader Natalie Bennett to be added to the line-up to split the left-wing vote.

The move came as Ofcom ruled commercial television and radio broadcasters should give Ukip the same standing as Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats in their general election coverage for the first time.

It will mean the Eurosceptic party will get extra party election broadcasts and increased coverage in new bulletins.

Mr Miliband said: ‘It's not for the Prime Minister to choose who is in the TV debates.

‘What's now clear is that David Cameron is trying to find any excuse to stop these debates happening. The Prime Minister should stand on his record and stop running scared.

‘He wants to avoid these debates at all costs.

‘This is a Prime Minister who is running scared, trying to chicken out of these TV debates.

‘He shouldn't be doing it because he owes it to the people as do I to make sure these debates happen.

‘David Cameron doesn't have the right to block these debates or choose who is in them. But it is now clear that he is trying to do anything to stop these debates happening. The PM should be able to stand on his record and stop running scared.’

Mr Clegg told the Prime Minister to ‘stop making excuses’ and warned that voters will expect him to take part.

The Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘Come on, David Cameron. The broadcasters have invited us, the public expect it, just say yes and stop making excuses.’

Mr Farage added: ‘Mr Cameron's comments about the TV debates show disdain for the British public who are very keen to hear from the major political party leaders - a point that Mr Cameron was not shy of making in 2010.

‘This proves that the Prime Minister is now a chicken, running scared, and running away from having an open and honest debate.

‘At a time when people seem increasingly disillusioned with British politics, it seems deeply irresponsible of Mr Cameron to hide away when this is obviously the most important general election for a generation.

‘It's unsurprising, given that Mr Cameron spent yesterday reiterating his support for the European Union, and the open border immigration policy imposed upon Britain by it.’
