Pope Francis has ordered 300 umbrellas left behind by tourists to be distributed to Rome's homeless to get them through a spate of unusually wet weather.

The umbrellas had been left behind by tourists visiting the Vatican museums, Sistine Chapel and St Peter's Basilica.

On Friday the Vatican also formally opened new facilities in St. Peter's Square where homeless people will be offered free showers, toiletries, shaves and haircuts.

The head of the pope's charity office, Monsignor Konrad Krajewski, said 300 umbrellas left behind by tourists at Vatican museums have been distributed in recent days.

The showers have been installed in a public lavatory block behind marble columns in St Peter's Square.

Monsignor Krajewski came up with the idea of building the showers after a homeless man he had invited to dinner told him he couldn't come as he 'stunk' - and told him that while it was relatively easy to find places to eat, it was difficult to find places to wash.

Barbers and hairdressers will visit the facilities and donate their services for free on Mondays, the day their shops are traditionally closed in Italy.

The showers will be open every day except Wednesday, when the square is crowded with people for the pope's general audience. 

The bathrooms were made with hi-tech, easy-to-clean materials to ensure proper hygiene, the Vatican said in a statement.

The initiative is being funded by donations and sales of papal parchments by Monsignor Krajewski's office.

Pope Francis, who was known as the 'slum bishop' in his native Buenos Aires because of his frequent visits to shantytowns, has made caring for the poor a major concern for his papacy.

He has stepped up the role of the Vatican 'elmosiniere' as part of his insistence that the church should look out for the poorest in society.

In addition to small acts of charity, Monsignor Krajewski's office handed out 400 sleeping bags to the homeless over Christmas and distributed 1,600 phone cards to new migrants on the island of Lampedusa. 

Each 'homeless pilgrim', as the Vatican calls the clients to the facilities, will receive a kit including a towel, change of underwear, soap, deodorant, toothpaste, razor and shaving cream..
