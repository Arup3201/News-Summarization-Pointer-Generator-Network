An enraged ex-boyfriend who was stalking his ex and her new lover rammed them off the road in the Bronx and then calmly walked up to the mangled SUV and fatally knifed the mother of his child in a frenzied attack while she was stricken in the passenger seat.

The horrific attack, which occurred on the Pelham Parkway in New York, unfolded in front of the 20-year-old's helpless new boyfriend, who watched as the 31-year-old suspect, Doines Espinal, knifed Katherine German in his Honda SUV.

Moments earlier, cab driver Espinal had sent the SUV driven by Jose Jiminez, 28, hurtling off the road and into a roll after stalking his ex-girlfriend and seeing German leave a Bronx hotel with her new boyfriend at 4 a.m. on Wednesday morning.

Driving a lime green outer boroughs taxi, Espinal is reported to have leapt from his own badly damaged car and repeatedly knifed German - stabbing her in the neck, chest and face.

The gruesome attack sent blood spurting across the cab as a horrified Jimenez was pinned into his seat by the Honda Pilot's airbag.

German was pronounced dead at the scene of the sickening incident.

The horrific attack apparently began when Espinal saw German, who is the mother of his two-month-old infant child, leaving the Paradise hotel in the Bronz with Jose Jimenez, 28, who was driving the SUV.

Espinal has previously been arrested for assaulting German and she had taken out a restraining order against him.

Police said that Espinal was waiting outside the hotel when German left with Jimenez in the early hours of the morning and gave chase as they drove off in the Honda SUV.

Hurtling down the New England Thruway from the Pelham Parkway, Espinal allegedly rammed his green cab into the side of the Honda SUV and caused it to smash into a concrete barrier on the side of the road and roll to a stop on the bike path alongside.

Espinal is then reported to have exited his car, walked over to the stricken vehicle and fatally knifed German in a frenzied attack.

The Bronx resident remained at the scene until the police arrived and he is currently being questioned by the NYPD pending charges being pressed on Wednesday.

The attackers co-workers at the Kiss Car Service in the Bronx said that the suspect had worked for the business for a number of years, but blamed his ex-girlfriend for his license being suspended.

She got me arrested,' the man told his co-workers according to the New York Daily News.

'He had his ... license suspended for a few days in August because he had a problem with his girlfriend,' said Maria Martinez, a Kiss Car secretary.

'My boss told him to keep it calm — if you can’t live with this person, just move away.'

Martinez said that Espinal was 'not the kind of person you'd expect to have a problem like this. It's very shocking to me.'

Jimenez did not need medical assistance after the crash.
