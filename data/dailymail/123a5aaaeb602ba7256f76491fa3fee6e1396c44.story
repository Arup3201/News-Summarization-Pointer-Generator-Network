The wife of  Alex Rodriguez's cousin has branded him ‘evil’ for urinating on a wall at their house in a bid to  keep them quiet about his  use of performance enhancing drugs.

Carmen Sucart blasted Rodriguez for allegedly committing the foul act at the couple's Miami home and criticized him for accusing her deathly ill husband of trying to extort him.

Her husband Yuri Sucart is Rodriguez's cousin and alleged to be his steroid mule, but she told The New York Daily News: 'He [Rodriguez] is the devil. He is evil.’

Career blow: New York Yankees superstar Alex Rodriguez admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs in an interview with federal agents, the Miami Herald reported on Wednesday

She said Rodriguez paid them a visit at their Miami home -which he bought for them -  and warned them against going public with information about his use of performance enhancing drugs.

She said  he then urinated on the wall and the patio in a move to show them that he was serious.

Sucart said: ‘He peed on the floor. He was so arrogant, he came into my house like he thought he was a god.’ 

She said her husband, who used to work for Rodriguez, was on call for him 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but the superstar treated him like a ‘slave, a servant.’

Despite this, her husband was very fond of Rodriguez and even helped to raise him after  his family abandoned him as a child.

Now, her husband is so ill that he is bed bound and surrounded by a breathing machine and pill bottles. He can barely walk, and one of his legs could be amputated, his wife said.

Her husband has been in poor health  following open-heart surgery and operations on both of his legs. He is also diabetic and suffers from high blood pressure.

He was arrested on August 5 and held in jail until August 17, his wife said, and then taken to a hospital because his condition worsened. She found him there August 21, she said.

She said: ‘Yuri may not survive and the family don't care,’ adding that A-Rod mocked her husband for being out of shape and called him the ‘N’ word.

‘(He) made fun of him for being overweight and because his teeth are bad and falling out. His teeth are bad because he is on blood thinners for his heart.’

Yuri Sucart is currently fighting seven federal felony charges and is scheduled to go on trial in February when Rodriguez could be called to testify.

Furthermore, Sucart claims that Rodriguez lied when he told Drug Enforcement Administration agents that a lawyer representing her husband sent him a letter asking for cash  in 2012. 

She said he made the allegations last January, when he agreed to cooperate with federal agents prosecuting Anthony Bosch and his Biogenesis doping clinic in exchange for limited immunity from prosecution.

He told agents that his cousin sent him an ‘extortion letter’ demanding $5 million for his silence on his relationship with  Bosch.

But Jeffrey Sonn, the Miami attorney  who represented Sucart at the time and wrote the letter, said he sought a settlement because Rodriguez had broken his promise to employ his cousin for life.

Sonn said that the superstar had told his cousin that he would look after him after he got him involved  in 2009 when he denied steroid use.

‘This was a simple case about breach of contract,’ Sonn said.  

In 2013, Rodriguez entered into a confidential settlement with Yuri Sucart  agreeing to pay him one $700,000 payment for his silence.

This was arranged along with three more payments made to Sucart that totalled $200,000, according to court papers filed in Miami last week.

However, it has been revealed that the superstar player did admit using performance-enhancing drugs in an interview with federal agents.

Details of the bombshell revelations were obtained by The Miami Herald who gained access to the documents as prosecutors pursue criminal charges against Bosch and six others  including Yuri Sucart.

Rodriguez admitted to buying and using hormone-filled syringes and creams from the clinic, the Herald reported, citing a 15-page summary of the meeting.

He injected human growth hormone into his stomach and described to federal authorities how the owner of the now-defunct clinic gave him tips on evading Major League Baseball's doping tests. 

Rodriguez could face even more legal woes if he is found to have steered players to Bosch.
