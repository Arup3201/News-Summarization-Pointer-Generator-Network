When proud mom Tara Taylor posted a picture of her toddler to Facebook, she received more than compliments - she picked up life-changing advice.

Taylor recently shared a photo of Rylee, three, which showed her left eye glowing.

Most friends liked the picture, but two urged Taylor to have Rylee's eye checked out because the glow looked suspicious. Their recommendation saved Rylee's eyesight.

When Tara Taylor posted this picture of her three-year-old daughter Rylee to Facebook, friends suggested she get the toddler's left glowing eye checked out

'They said ‘Hey, I’m sure it’s nothing. 
It’s probably the lighting, but your daughter’s eye is glowing and you 
might want to have it checked out because it’s a sign there could be an 
issue with her eye',' Taylor told WREG. 

Taylor took the toddler to a pediatrician and then a retina specialist with Baptist Eye Clinic in Memphis, Tennessee who diagnosed Rylee with Coats' disease.

The rare condition causes vision loss or blindness in one eye caused by abnormal development of blood vessels behind the retina.

The early intervention saved Rylee's sight.

Taylor said she had no indication her daughter had trouble seeing.

'She didn’t sit close to the TV. She is actually in gymnastics and can walk on the balance beam,'  Taylor told WREG.

Dr. Jorge Calzada with the Charles Retina Institute and Baptist Eye Clinic said the earlier children can be treated, the better.

'The
 significant problem we have with children is that a child won’t say, 
‘Mommy, I can’t see out of my right eye.’ It is usually caught in an 
expected way,' Dr. Calzada said.

'When a child recognizes he cannot see or the parent 
recognizes they cannot see, it’s often because they’ve lost vision in 
both eyes.'
