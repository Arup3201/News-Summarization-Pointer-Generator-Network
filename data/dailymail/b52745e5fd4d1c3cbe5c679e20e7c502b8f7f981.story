Startling new research has revealed just how vulnerable our planet is to asteroid impacts.

A trio of former astronauts has announced we’re up to ten times more likely to be hit than previously thought - and warn the only way we’ve avoided disaster so far is through 'blind luck'.

However, the majority of the impacts occurred either high up in the atmosphere, or in unpopulated areas including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

New research suggests Earth is hit by up to ten times as many asteroids than was previously thought - and we've only avoided a 'city-killer' so far through 'blind luck.' However, the majority of the impacts occurred either high up in the atmosphere, or in unpopulated areas including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans

The announcement was made at a press conference at the Seattle Museum of Flight.

Asteroids hitting the Earth caused 26 nuclear-scale explosions between 2000 and 2013, a new report has revealed.

Some
 were more powerful, and in one case, dozens of times stronger, than the 
15-kiloton atom bomb blast that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.

The
 impacts were recorded by the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation which
 operates a global network of sensors listening out for nuclear weapon 
detonations.

Most occurred too high in the atmosphere to cause any serious damage on the ground.

But the evidence is a sobering reminder of how vulnerable the Earth is to the threat from space, say scientists.

The
 most dramatic impact by an asteroid or comet in recent times occurred 
when an object exploded over Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908 with an energy 
yield equivalent to between 5,000 and 15,000 tons of TNT.

An area of forest covering 770 square miles (2,000 square km) was flattened by the blast.

Three former astronauts supporting the B612 Foundation - a private company devoted to protecting Earth from asteroids - presented the data.

Dr Ed Lu, former U.S. Shuttle and Soyuz astronaut, and CEO of the B612 Foundation, was joined by fellow former astronauts Tom Jones and Bill Anders, the latter of whom flew on Apollo 8.

The findings are based on information released from the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation.

This operates a network of sensors that monitor Earth around the clock listening for the infrasound signatures of nuclear detonations.

But what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions, but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale.

Between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on Earth ranging in energy from one to 600 kilotons – all caused by asteroid impacts.

By comparison, the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945 exploded with an energy impact of 15 kilotons, which was enough to level the city and kill around 80,000 people.

The explosions detected on Earth, believed to have been caused by asteroids, were up to 40 times as powerful as the nuclear bomb that devastated Hiroshima in 1945, pictured

The discovery signifies a ten-fold increase on the number of large asteroids that were previously thought to strike Earth, and the astronauts claim Earth is incredibly lucky to have avoided a major disaster occurring so far.

Dr Lu said ‘most large asteroids with the potential to destroy an entire country or continent have been detected.’

But, he went on to say, ‘less than 10,000 of the more than a million dangerous asteroids with the potential to destroy an entire major metropolitan area have been found by all existing space or terrestrially-operated observatories.

‘Because we don’t know where or when the next major impact will occur, the only thing preventing a catastrophe from a "city-killer" sized asteroid has been blind luck.’

Despite the majority of impacts occurring in water and high up in the atmosphere, a number have taken place on land. For example, the Chelyabinsk meteorite, contrail pictured, flew above the Russian city in 2013. The impact injured hundreds of people and served as a reminder of how deadly incoming space rocks can be

The solution, according to the B612 Foundation, is to build an early warning infrared space telescope for tracking asteroids.

This would come in the form of their Sentinel Space Telescope Mission, which would let experts track potentially deadly asteroids many years in advance, when they are still millions of miles away.

This would be the world’s first privately-funded deep space mission to create the first comprehensive dynamic map of our inner solar system.

With a planned launch in 2018, it would identify the current and future locations and trajectories of asteroids that cross Earth’s orbit.

It is hoped the satellite would detect more than 200,000 asteroids in the first year of its operation.

It
 would be capable of finding so many thanks to its unique orbit away 
from Earth, which would scan the area around Earth’s orbit.

And, the team hopes, it would be capable of finding and tracking asteroids that pose the greatest threat to life on Earth.

This would be the most capable near-Earth orbit (NEO) detection system in operation.

It
 would be located in a Venus-like orbit but pointed towards the orbital 
plane of Earth, completing a trip around the sun every seven months.

Precise pointing accuracy to sub-pixel resolution would allow images to be studied in detail.

It is designed for highly autonomous, reliable operation requiring only weekly ground contact and could perform surveying operations for around 6.5 years.

The highly specialised design is specifically optimised for NEO detection and discovery.

Sentinel is expected to discover approximately 500,000 NEOs by 2024, which will account for 98 per cent of all NEOs known to humanity.

But the team states that if an asteroid is on a collision course with Earth the mission only has a 30 per cent chance of finding it.

If
 one is found, the B612 Foundation said: 'It is our belief that the 
people of the world will then unite in carrying out a deflection of that
 asteroid to prevent this future impact.'

The Sentinel satellite, pictured, is planned to launch in 2018. The team says that by 2024 it will find up to 500,000 asteroids, which would account for 98% of all near-Earth asteroids known to humanity

The Sentinel satellite would operate in an almost identical orbit to another proposed mission called the NEO Survey Observatory. The orbit and field of view of the satellites are shown in this illustration
