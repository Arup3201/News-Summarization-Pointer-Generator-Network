It was billed as a death-defying stunt which was his most dangerous yet and would astonish millions.

But David Blaine’s latest feat has been dismissed as having ‘no danger’ by one of the world’s most eminent physicists.

Professor John Belcher said he would be happy to take the illusionist’s place even though he was 69 and by nature ‘risk-averse’.

Exercises: Twenty-four hours into the three-day stunt, Blaine appeared to be a little uncomfortable and did some stretching

Blaine has been standing in the middle of a million volts of electric current streamed by Tesla coils for his stunt Electrified.

They have been sending giant lightning bolts shooting towards him for the three-day event ending tonight.

His only protection has been a suit of armour and a specially designed helmet.

But the professor, an acclaimed space expert, said his only worry would be getting enough sleep.

Armour: The illusionist and endurance man was protected from the volts by a suit of chain mail and wire helmet

‘He has a conducting suit, all the current is going through the suit, nothing through his body,’ he said.

‘There is no danger that I see. I would do it, and I am 69 and risk-averse. I just would have to take a nap.’

He added that the magician was wearing a Faraday suit made of highly conductive stainless steel.

Workmen
 use one if building high-voltage power lines and amateur physicists 
sometimes fashion their own while studying Tesla coils.

William Allen Zajc, a physicist at Columbia University, was also unimpressed.

He said the only notable thing was that Blaine was having to stand for 72 hours.

The event in New York also prompted the following post on Twitter: ‘David Blaine electrified... if only.’

So
 far, the stunt is going to plan although Blaine suffered an electric 
shock in practice when a visor on his helmet touched his nose.
