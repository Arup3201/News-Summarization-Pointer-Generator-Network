Separatists demanded the end of EU sanctions in return for the release of six military observers seized by militia in eastern Ukraine.

The mayor of Slaviansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, said he would only discuss plans to free the six if sanctions were lifted against rebel leaders.

Ukraine’s security service now believes a serving Russian intelligence officer - pretending to be a local separatist leader - orchestrated the abduction and is now at the centre of an attempted trade-off over sanctions.

Officials in both Kiev and Moscow say they have plans to free the monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), who were seized last week but Mr Ponomaryov claimed this would not happen until newly imposed sanctions freezing assets and banning travel on two separatist leaders are lifted.

It came as there were increasing signs last night that the Ukraine crisis was having an effect on key parts of the Russian economy.

Russian natural gas exporter Gazprom said further sanctions could disrupt gas sales to Europe and hit its business, while a Russian minister said U.S. restrictions on high-tech exports to Russia would be a blow to Russian companies in the sector.

Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warned the ‘Iron Curtain’ style sanctions from the United States might harm its hi-tech sector and that the EU was ‘under Washington’s thumb.’

He insisted Russia had no intention of invading eastern Ukraine, adding: ‘This is a revival of a system created in 1949 when Western countries essentially lowered an ‘Iron Curtain’, cutting off supplies of hi-tech goods to the USSR and other countries.’

And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin warned that the impact of sanctions in the country’s high-tech sector could impact on US astronauts using the joint space station.

‘If their aim is to deliver a blow to Russia’s rocket-building sector, then by default, they would be exposing their astronauts on the ISS,’ he said.

‘Sanctions are always a boomerang which come back and painfully hit those who launched them, he added.

The International Space Station is operated jointly by Russia, the United States, Europe, Japan and Canada. Astronauts and cosmonauts depend on Russian Soyuz rockets to ferry them between it and Earth, ever since NASA scrapped its space shuttles in 2011.

The US imposed sanctions on 17 companies and seven officials linked to Vladimir Putin’s inner circle - including a career spy who was expelled from London in the Cold War.

Mr Ryabkov lambasted White House spokesman Jay Carney who said the targeting of Mr Putin’s inner circle was ‘in response to Russia’s continued illegal intervention in Ukraine and provocative acts that undermine Ukraine’s democracy’ and territorial integrity.

‘We are disgusted with the statement issued by the White House press secretary,’ said Mr Ryabkov.

The EU’s top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, last night voiced alarm at the ‘downward spiral of violence and intimidation’ in Ukraine.

Hundreds of masked pro-Russian separatists armed with baseball bats yesterday stormed the regional government headquarters, unopposed by police, in the eastern city of Luhansk, 15 miles west of the border with Russia.

It was the third government building seized in the past 24 hours as the occupations by Moscow’s supporters showed no sign of ending.

Ukrainian forces claim to have unearthed evidence that Igor Strelkov, nicknamed Strelok, who commands pro-Russian forces now in control of Slaviansk, is in fact a serving Russian GRU military intelligence officer.

Media reports citing the SBU secret service in Kiev say his real identity is Igor Girkin and that he is a colonel in the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian Armed forces.

His Russian passport number and address in Moscow were published in Ukraine where intelligence officers say Girkin legally crossed the Ukrainian border in Simferopol on 26 February, when the Crimean parliament was seized.
