Scotland Yard faces a new corruption inquiry after a burglar ‘admitted’ carrying out  500 break-ins.

Four officers are under investigation amid fears the offender may have been encouraged to confess to crimes he did not commit, to help improve clear-up rates.

Last night the force suspended a system whereby crimes are ‘taken into consideration’ over concerns of widespread abuse.

It also stripped from its system the 500 ‘TICs’, a tacit admission the man’s confession was not credible.

Probe: Scotland Yard faces a new corruption inquiry after a burglar 'admitted' carrying out 500 break-ins

The announcement of an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission’s corruption unit is the latest blow to embattled Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe.

This week he was criticised by MPs for failing to get a grip on historic corruption allegations linked to the Stephen Lawrence investigation and the mass shredding of documents.

The Metropolitan Police is already under scrutiny over crime recording methods after a whistleblower revealed widespread fiddling of the figures.

Last night, Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, which has been investigating crime recording practices said: ‘It is a concern that some crimes may have been written off as having been dealt with by those who have no responsibility for their commission.’

MPs have also raised questions about whether the Met is giving sufficient priority and resources to investigating internal corruption.

There are only 36 staff probing disturbing allegations that Met police officers stole and trafficked in drugs, took bribes and sold confidential intelligence to criminals.

By contrast the Yard has 88 staff working on phone hacking by the media and 17 on allegations of computer hacking by journalists – a total of 105 – at a cost so far of £19.4million.

A further 40 staff are investigating the historic allegations of sexual abuse by the dead DJ Jimmy Savile and others at a cost of £3.75million.

Scotland Yard said the case of the 500 burlgaries taken into account emerged as part of a review ordered after concerns over ‘integrity’ in a routine sampling of cases.

The Met said the investigation covers almost all of south-east London, from Lambeth to Lewisham and Croydon to Bexley.

Three detective constables and a sergeant are under investigation but have not been suspended. It is understood that, after admitting the offences, which span a nine-year period from 2004 to last year, the suspect, who has not been named, withdrew his confession.

Under the ‘taken into consideration’ system, criminals can admit offences which do not form part of the main charge they face in court.

As a result they can never be prosecuted for them, but they will not face a longer punishment as a result of admitting them.

Crucially, the crimes count as solved for the purpose of clear-up rates.

Police say the system gives closure to victims, and allows offenders to ‘wipe their slate clean’ and move on.

But critics say it is ripe for abuse and any admissions should result in a tougher punishment.

Explosive details of police 
corruption contained in files shredded by Scotland Yard could have been 
preserved by a second secret investigation into rogue officers, it has 
emerged.

The
 Metropolitan Police has admitted that it destroyed a number of 
documents relating to Operation Othona – a multi-million pound inquiry 
examining criminal behaviour by its officers – more than a decade ago.

But
 the force later launched another anti-corruption probe, codenamed 
Operation Zloty, which lasted for nine years and uncovered a network of 
rogue police who were working with organised criminals. A leaked police anti-corruption report from 2002 refers to Operation Zloty, stating:

‘Operation
 Zloty is a long-term intelligence operation to assess the threat that 
organised criminals and their associations with serving and retired 
police officers pose to the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service).

‘These
 subjects have been undermining the MPS with virtual immunity for the 
last ten years and were identified during the course of two previous 
intelligence-gathering operations, “Othona” and “Centaur”.’

The
 revelation raised hopes that some of the Othona material, described by a
 former head of the Met’s anti-corruption branch as ‘gold-dust stuff’, 
may have been saved.

If found, it could shed light on concerns that 
corrupt officers undermined botched investigations into the murders of 
the black teenager Stephen Lawrence and private eye Daniel Morgan.
