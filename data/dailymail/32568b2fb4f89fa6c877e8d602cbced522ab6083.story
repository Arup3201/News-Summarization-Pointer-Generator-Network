The Northeast's first 'significant' winter storm of the season was expected to bring a messy mix of rain, snow and sleet along the Interstate 95 corridor starting late Friday night, the National Weather Service said.

The weather service said Thursday it was still too early to determine the exact track of the storm, but some areas could expect up to 7 inches or more of snow.

The storm should arrive in the Philadelphia region Friday night and dump 'several inches' of snow before turning to rain sometime Saturday, the weather service said. 

On Thursday, a winter storm has swept through parts of Texas, dropping up to a foot of snow in the Panhandle and prompting El Paso to close government offices early. 

Temperatures also plummeted in Mexico, with snow in the city of Ciudad Juarez, prompting authorities to send out a weather warning for a 'Cold Front 30,' which is expected to cause below-zero temperatures in the area

Dozens of school districts canceled classes or delayed opening in the Panhandle and South Plains on Thursday. Government offices, schools and universities from El Paso to the Midland-Odessa, San Angelo and Big Bend areas closed early Thursday and planned to open late on Friday.

Almost 5 inches of snow was reported in El Paso by midafternoon Thursday before tapering off. As much as a foot of snow was reported in Amarillo and the northern Panhandle and a remote area of West Texas between Midland and San Angelo.

The Northeastern storm will travel up the Eastern seaboard and eventually move out to sea off New England by early Sunday.

Meteorologist Bill Simpson of the National Weather Service in Taunton, Massachusetts, said the storm could drop half a foot of heavy, wet snow in parts of northern and eastern Connecticut, including about 3 to 5 inches in the Hartford area.

Temperatures will be close to freezing, making it difficult to predict exactly which areas are likely to receive more rain than snow, Simpson said.

Saturday's forecast still sees rain and snow move over the Northeast of the country

Saturday night sees conditions ease but temperatures are still very low

Baltimore and Washington were expected to get only rain as temperatures hover just below freezing, forecasters said.

AccuWeather.com's Chief Meteorologist, Ellion Abrams, said this morning: Unlike many storms this winter, this particular one has the potential to bring a foot of snow to some locations, where rain fails to mix in over New England.

'Where the snow is heavy and wet, there could be trees coming down with power outages', he said. 

Major delays in the South on Interstate 81 and 95 corridors are also expected on Friday night and Saturday due to rain.

When Ice Storms ravaged parts of the North East and Midwest two weeks ago - the South Haven lighthouse in Michigan was completely covered in icicles.  

As temperatures plummeted it was transformed into a stunning white structure and an attraction for photographers willing to brave the chilly winds and snow. 

Sharp icicles and surreal formations can be seen hanging from the railings after strong waves crashed onto the piers. After each coating the water quickly freezes to ice and the pier is transformed into a slippery, white wonderland.

These pictures were taken when the mercury fell below zero just two weeks ago - and weather forecasters predict it will do the same this weekend.
