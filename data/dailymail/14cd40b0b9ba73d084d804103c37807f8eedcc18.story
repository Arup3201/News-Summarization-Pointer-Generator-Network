Detained: Majid al-Majid is being held by Lebanese army intelligence in Beirut

Lebanese authorities have arrested the head of an al-Qaeda linked group that claimed responsibility for the suicide bomb attack on Iran's embassy in November.

Two U.S. sources said that media reports from Lebanon that Lebanese Armed Forces had recently captured Majid bin Muhammad al-Majid, leader of the Abdullah Azzam Brigades were credible.

The sources did not offer further details on the circumstances in which he was captured.

Lebanese media reported on Tuesday that Majid had been arrested two days ago.

One report said he had lived for years in a Palestinian refugee camp 
before leaving for Syria a month ago, where he allegedly pledged 
allegiance to the leader of the Nusrah Front, one of the most extreme 
and violent Islamic militant groups fighting to oust the government of 
President Bashar Assad.

According
 to the Long War Journal, a respected counter-terrorism blog, Majid is 
among 85 individuals identified on a Saudi government list issued in 
2009 as most wanted for their alleged involvement with al-Qaeda.

The
 Long War Journal said that the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, named after a 
founder of al Qaeda and associate of the late Osama bin Laden, were 
formed some time after 2005 as a spinoff of al-Qaeda in Iraq.

The blog said the group's mission was to attack targets in Lebanon and elsewhere around the Middle East.

The twin suicide bombings that struck outside the Iranian
 Embassy in Beirut in November, killed 23 people including an Iranian 
diplomat.

The obscure 
Abdullah Azzam Brigades said it carried out the mid-morning bombings in a
 Hezbollah stronghold - the latest strike in battles that have played 
out in the region for decades and now intensified with the civil war 
next door in Syria.

The 
authenticity of the claim could not be independently verified but it was
 posted on a militant website and on the Twitter account of Sirajuddin 
Zurayqat, a prominent Islamic militant leader.

The
 group said it will continue with such attacks until the Iranian-backed 
Hezbollah group withdraws its forces from Syria, where the group is 
fighting alongside President Bashar Assad's forces against the mostly 
Sunni rebels seeking to topple him.
