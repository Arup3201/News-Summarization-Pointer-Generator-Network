Louis van Gaal has confirmed that Phil Jones could be out of action for between three weeks and a month with a hamstring strain – one of NINE players sidelined at Old Trafford.

Jones limped out of England’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland in Basel on Monday night and was immediately sent for scans that revealed the extent of his injury.

He joins Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini, Chris Smalling, Ashley Young, Jesse Lingard, James Wilson, Reece James and Sam Johnstone on the sidelines. The only good news is that and Luke Shaw is available again and Carrick has started running on grass after eight weeks out with ankle ligament damage.

The injury list is so long that Van Gaal turned up at his Friday press conference with a piece of paper.

‘Now I have my paper and my glasses,’ said the Dutchman. ‘Fellaini not ready, Carrick not ready but he has run for first time on grass – unbelievable after eight weeks – Johnstone elbow problems, Smalling not fit enough but he shall train tomorrow with the group for first time, Wilson and James not ready, Jones is injured with the national team, Lingard, Young also injured.

‘Nine players and when I left for international week there were 10. Only one is back – Shaw. He is fit enough to play minutes but not the whole game so that’s the difference.

‘Fellaini is longer than a month, Jones maybe three weeks or a month but it’s very difficult to say and not good to say that because I lay pressure on him.’
