Charles' brace either side of half-time gives Celta Vigo 2-0 win vs Real Madrid

Errors from Sergio Ramos and Xabi Alonso burst Real's La Liga title hopes

Two
horrendous mistakes by Sergio Ramos and Xabi Alonso destroyed Real Madrid’s
hopes of winning the treble.

To
have a chance of lifting La Liga Madrid needed Barcelona and Atletico Madrid to
stumble, which they did, but failed to keep their own part of the bargain.

They
put in a miserable display at Balaidos, creating little and handing Celta Vigo
their goals on a silver platter.

Party pooper: Celta Vigo striker Charles scored twice in their 2-0 win against Real Madrid on Sunday

Ramos
and Alonso, both experienced performers, let their concentration slip on two
occasions and Charles capitalised on both of them.

Real
began the game playing like a team just whiling down the days before they come
to the showpiece event in their season, the Champions League final.

But
even though the chance to complete La Decima, winning their 10th top
European trophy, is what they have been waiting for, this season could have
been so much more.

They
have thrown away two huge chances to get into a strong position in La Liga in
recent weeks, dropping points against both Valencia and Valladolid.

Carlo
Ancelotti’s hand was forced in part because of injuries, but Madrid’s team was
particularly weak-looking given the strength in depth in their squad.

Cristiano
Ronaldo, Angel Di Maria, Pepe, Raphael Varane and Karim Benzema are among Real
Madrid’s recent casualties, and Gareth Bale was left on the bench as he returns
to fitness.

As
a result, Los Blancos put out a weakened team and Alvaro Morata looked
particularly lost up front, with Isco in support.

Sami
Khedira played his first game for the club in six months, returning from his
long-term knee injury to form part of a sturdy but underwhelming central
midfield.

Luka
Modric was pushed further up the pitch to accommodate him and Casemiro, along
with Xabi Alonso.

There
was little creativity being offered in the middle, in the absence of Di Maria
who has excelled for Madrid there this season.

The
best chance of the first 30 minutes fell to Celta Vigo striker Charles, who got
on the end of a scooped through ball but headed wide of the post.

Moving on: Real midfield duo Luka Modric (left) and Xabi Alonso (right) were powerless during their defeat

Plus point: Sami Khedira (left) played his first game for Real vs Celta injuring his knee in November

Madrid
had one effort of real note, with Morata blazing wide after a strong run from
Marcelo down the left flank.

The
Brazilian full-back is battling for the starting place against Atletico Madrid
in the Champions League final and was one of only a couple Real players showing
any spirit.

But
then disaster struck for Ramos, who has been one of Madrid’s heroes in recent
weeks with his goals from the back. Dawdling on the edge of his own box,
Charles snuck in to rob him.

Diego
Lopez came rushing out, but Charles neatly rounded him and then rifled it into
the top left corner.

Missed opportunity: Defeat at Celta means Carlo Ancelotti cannot win La Liga in his debut season as Real boss

In vein: Brazilian midfielder Casemiro (right) tries to bring Real back into the game with a left-footed shot

They
came out for the second half with significantly more purpose, Modric hooking
over the bar from close range after another Marcelo run.

Ramos
nearly made amends for his mistake, nodding home at the other end but being
correctly adjudged offside.

Ancelotti
rolled the dice, taking back both players who had returned from injury
lay-offs, in Alvaro Arbeloa and Khedira, introducing Coentrao and Asier
Illaramendi respectively.

But
Gareth Bale was left on the bench, when Madrid were screaming out for his
dynamism.

Heavy hit: Sergio Ramos (left) tackles Rafinha (right) as Real Madrid lost 2-0 at Celta Vigo on Sunday

And
before too long, Real paid the price. Charles netted his second, again after an
incredible Real Madrid error.

Committing
the footballing equivalent of hari-kari, Alonso rolled the ball to Charles
instead of his goalkeeper when passing it back.

The
Brazilian kept his cool once again, negotiating a course past Lopez and rolling
the ball into the net.

Madrid
lost their cool, with Coentrao pushing and shoving Orellano as the game came
towards a close.

Wanted: Celta Vigo manager Luis Enrique has been strongly linked as becoming Barcelona's boss next season

No look: Nacho (left) was unable to prevent Real's title hopes disappearing with the club third in La Liga

Young
forward Willian Jose replaced Casemiro, leaving Bale stuck on the bench—with
Ancelotti not wanting to risk the Wales star’s fitness ahead of the Champions
League final.

That,
now, is the only target left for Real Madrid who will hope that Ronaldo and Co
are back to full fitness by the time May 24 comes around.

If
Real complete La Decima, this will be viewed as a successful season. If not, it
will forever be rued for what might have been.
