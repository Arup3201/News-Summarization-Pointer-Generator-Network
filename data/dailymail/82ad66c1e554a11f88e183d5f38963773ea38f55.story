Dogan Ismail, 17, was lured to his death with a promise that a BlackBerry handset would be returned

A 15-year-old boy who stabbed a 'model pupil' to death as he pleaded for the return of a stolen mobile phone is today facing a life sentence.

Dogan Ismail, 17, was lured to his death with a promise that the BlackBerry handset  - stolen from a friend - would be returned.

But instead, his attacker - who has previous convictions for carrying a knife - emerged with a knife.

He plunged it into the chest of sixth form student Dogan, who collapsed and bled to death at the scene on the Aylesbury Estate in Walworth, southeast London, last December 30.

The 15-year-old, who cannot be named, denied murder but was convicted after a week-long trial at the Old Bailey.

Judge Christopher Moss QC told him: ‘The sentence the court is bound to impose for a boy of your age for murder is one of detention at Her Majesty’s Pleasure.

‘I have to set the minimum term you must serve before you can be considered for release.’

The youth, originally from Gambia, will be sentenced on July 2, when Judge Moss consider lifting the court order that protects the killer’s identity.

Dogan’s mother wept and left court as the verdicts were delivered, while his killer scowled in the dock.

Jurors heard the teenage knifeman had been part of a group who snatched the phone from an associate of Dogan's two days earlier.

Dogan found out about the theft after asking why the other boy had been unable to contact him.

He then vowed he would track down the culprit and get the phone returned and the pair took a 343 bus from Peckham to the Aylesbury Estate.

The 15-year-old initially agreed to return the phone before leading them to a flat he claimed was his and telling them he would fetch it from inside.

But when he returned, he was wielding a knife, the court heard.

In a video interview played to jurors, the victim’s associate, who is now aged 16 and also cannot be named, said: ‘He genuinely thought he was going to get the phone back and it would be alright.

‘But [the alleged killer] comes out with a knife and walks straight up to him and stabs him in the chest.‘He said, “You’ve stabbed me” and falls on the floor.

‘[The alleged killer] just walks away casually.’

The 15-year-old, from Peckham, admitted theft of the mobile phone but denied murder.
