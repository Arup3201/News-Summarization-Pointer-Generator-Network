Fakes: Shaun Morris, an ex-motorbike world champion, transformed his bedroom into a £100,000 business selling counterfeit designer shoes on eBay under celebrity names

Piled high: Morris sold imitation Timberland boots, Uggs and Nike and Puma trainers using 10 eBay accounts

Morris' trial motorcycling career was ended in 2007 when an eye injury threatened his sight. He is a former junior world champion

Morris, 30, of Charnock Richard, Lancashire, was sentenced to 14 months in prison in February last year after selling more than £100,000 of imitation Ugg boots, Timberland boots, as well as Nike and Puma trainers through 10 separate eBay accounts in celebrity names including actor John Malkovich.

But now, after serving his sentence, a confiscation order was made for him to pay back £56,000 plus £9,200 in costs, at Preston Crown Court.

Morris, whose titles include World Junior Champion in 2003, European Champion in 2005 and Australian Champion in 2005, recruited his mother and sister to act as bankers for his illicit business.

The pair allowed cash to be transferred through their bank and PayPal account.

Together they all ran the counterfeit shoe trading empire from the family home in the Lancashire village.

The fake designer footwear is seen here ready to be dispatched to unsuspecting customers. The crimes came to light after a Trading Standards officers conducted a test purchase of a pair of Timberland boots

Trading Standards officers seized 76 pairs of Timberland boots, 53 pairs of Ugg boots, nine pairs of Nike trainers and nine pairs of Puma trainers

Morris, who masterminded the operation, had pleaded guilty to five counts of possessing counterfeit goods and two of money laundering.

His sister Jane Morris, who was found guilty of two counts of concealing criminal property, and their mother Celia Morris, 60, guilty of one count, were handed 40 weeks in prison suspended for two years, with 200 hours unpaid work.

Preston Crown Court heard that Morris' money was invested in company shares and a property. He could be jailed for nine months if the cash is not repaid in 18 months.

His mother Celia was ordered to pay £12,500 and costs of £11,500 within two months.

As well as competing at the British Championships Morris also rode at major events overseas

At his sentencing last year Morris' counsel said that after the accident he was looking for ways to occupy his time

The crimes came to light after a Trading Standards officers conducted a test purchase of a pair of Timberland boots.

But after being sent to Timberland itself, the brand confirmed they were counterfeit.

Search warrants were obtained for the addresses which had been linked to the various eBay accounts.

Trading Standards officers seized 76 pairs of Timberland boots, 53 pairs of Ugg boots, nine pairs of Nike trainers and nine pairs of Puma trainers.

Sentencing, Judge Heather Lloyd said: 'Shaun Morris and Celia Morris were convicted in December 2012 and January 2013. By virtue of their convictions a proceeds of crime application has been made by the Crown who has provided me with information in relation to both Shaun and Celia Morris.

'Shaun Morris, I agree that from the benefit of criminal conduct is £56,000, there will be a confiscation order of £56,000 and costs £9,200, 18 months default.

'Celia Morris, a confiscation order of £12,500 and costs £11,500. A default of nine months.'

At his sentencing last year Morris' counsel said that after the accident he was looking for ways to occupy his time.
