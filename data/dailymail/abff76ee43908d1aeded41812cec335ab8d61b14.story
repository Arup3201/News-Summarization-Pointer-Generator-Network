Wayne Rooney has backed Harry Kane to impress should he make his England debut in Friday night's European Championship qualifier with Lithuania at Wembley.

The Tottenham Hotspur forward, who has scored 29 goals in all competitions this campaign, has been called up to the senior national squad for the first time.

And England captain Rooney believes the 21-year-old has what it takes to succeed on the international stage.

'His season has been incredible, it's his first year in the Premier League and to score the goals, his performances have been excellent,' he said.

'He fully deserves the call-up. We've seen that he's a goalscorer, if he gets a chance he can finish. It's great for English football.

'He's been on a different route to me and he's having a tremendous season.

'If there's anything I can help him with then I'm here but at the minute he's doing well. I'm sure he's got family and friends around him to keep his feet on the ground.

'If he keeps doing what he's doing, he'll have no problems.'

England enter their qualifier with a 100 per cent record in Group E and then travel to Turin to play Italy in a friendly on Tuesday night.

Manager Roy Hodgson confirmed that Kane would make his full Three Lions debut in one of the matches but gave nothing else away.

He said: 'I'm not prepared to reveal the line-up. I've been very happy with Harry Kane this week. He's done well.

'He's not in any way damaged his chances of playing in the senior teams and I am sure over the course of the two games we will see him make his full debut.

'We'll see if that's from the start against Lithuania or on Tuesday or coming on as a substitute.'

Hodgson, who will hold contract talks with Football Association chairman Greg Dyke within the next year, has welcomed the selection decisions presented to him by the current England squad.

He said: 'There's quite a lot of tight decisions. I welcome tight decisions. If we're to progress and get better, we need competition in all areas.

'It's nice to see Kyle Walker back after injuries. The centre backs Chris Smalling and Phil Jones, who have missed part of the season, are doing well.

'The competition is hotting up - except in the goalkeeping area. We thought we had three top-class goalkeepers and now we only have one.'

That follows the withdrawal of Southampton's Fraser Forster with a serious knee injury that could rule him out for the rest of the season.

Hodgson called Queens Park Rangers stopper Rob Green and Stoke's Jack Butland into his squad to compensate for Forster's absence, which he described as 'devastating.'

He added: 'We've been in touch. There's not much we can do to cheer him up.'  

As he prepares to win his 102nd England cap against Lithuania, Rooney was asked whether assuming the captain's armband last year had changed him.

He replied: 'I had huge boots to fill taking over from Steven Gerrard and you learn things along the way. I knew I wouldn't make all the right decisions along the way.

'It's a different experience but the players have reacted well and we're winning games. I'm pleased with the job I've done. Hopefully that can continue and we keep winning games.'
