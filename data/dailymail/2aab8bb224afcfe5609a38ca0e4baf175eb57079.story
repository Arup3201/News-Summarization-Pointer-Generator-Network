Harry Redknapp's message was clear. ‘If we sold Charlie Austin we might as well go home’ was his assessment after the striker fired QPR to another win with the sort of hat-trick which will have England manager Roy Hodgson taking notice.

Redknapp, the QPR boss, is aware bigger clubs will come knocking when the January transfer window opens.

With 18 months left on Austin’s contract, Rangers owner Tony Fernandes knows they must tie him down — and sharpish. That need is even more pressing after he dragged his side to what had looked an impossible win after Albion took a two-goal lead through Joleon Lescott and Silvestre Varela.

Austin headed in his side's winner three minutes from the end of normal time to seal the win and his hat-trick 

Sportsmail was delighted to see Craig Pawson give a penalty for James Morrison tugging Leroy Fer’s shirt in the box. We have been campaigning for several weeks to rid the game of this cheating.

Austin is the top English goalscorer in the Premier League — only Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero have more than his 11 — and he has earned QPR a stunning 13 points. Without him, they would be heading back to the Championship.

‘His target would be around 20 goals now,’ said Redknapp. ‘The way he’s going, it’s not impossible.’

This is the same Austin, don’t forget, who was scoring goals for Poole Town in the Wessex League five years ago. ‘He’s a goalscorer. He’s got a great attitude,’ added Redknapp. ‘There is no side to him. He ain’t lairy — he’s a lovely boy who’s been to work for a living.’

Austin’s story is one to inspire young footballers scratching around in non-league. It can be done through hard graft, if you have the talent.

For this 25-year-old, the rise might have happened sooner. Grandfather Alistair is an old friend of Redknapp and urged the manager to sign him when at Tottenham.

Redknapp admitted he scoffed when ‘Ozzy’ said his grandson, a striker with Hungerford Town, would do a job in the top flight, but who’s laughing now? An England call could well be on the way. ‘It’s a knack — he’s in the right place at the right time,’ added Redknapp. ‘If you score 20 goals in the Championship this year you’ll score in the Premier League.’

They’ve known each other for two decades but Redknapp scoffed when ‘Ozzy’ said his grandson would do a job in the top flight when finding the net at Hungerford Town. Who’s laughing now? An England call could very well be on its way.

‘Goalscorers find a yard of space. It’s a knack - he’s in the right place at the right time,’ Redknapp added. ‘If you score 20 goals in the Championship this year you’ll score in the Premier League. It’s not rocket science, it’s that knack that people have got - they’ve been scoring goals since they were kids.’

Ask Austin what his dreams were as a boy and this can’t be far off.
