A high-end steakhouse in the Meatpacking
District is offering New York restaurant goers their first real taste 
of a Kobe steak, for a whopping $350.

While restaurants across America have claimed to sell 
Kobe beef on their upscale menus for years, charging customers hundreds of 
dollars for the delicacy, these steaks have previously been fakes.

Until August 17, 2012, it has been illegal to buy, sell, and import any Japanese beef in the U.S, including the rare Kobe; and while some ranchers in the Midwest have claimed to recreate it, they only produce what Forbes Magazine has called 'Faux-be' beef - a cut of meat that is all beef, but no Kobe.

The real deal: The Old Homestead Steakhouse in the Meatpacking District is offering New York restaurant goers their first real taste of a Kobe steak, for a whopping $350

Last month the USDA lifted the ban on the import, which was originally set in place because of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Japan, and now the brand new steak dish at Old Homestead Steakhouse is so popular that the restaurant doesn't even have it on the menu.

Owner Greg Sherry told MailOnline: 'We got our first shipment on Friday, and already it has sold out.

'The availability is so limited, so we're keeping it to a first come, first serve basis of reservations only,' he said.

During the import ban, restaurants have been charging approximately $40 for a 
'Kobe' burger or $100 for a 'Kobe' steak, conning customers into paying top dollar by using a word synonymous with 
excellence and good quality meat.

'We got our first shipment on Friday, and already it has sold out'

However The Old Homestead Steakhouse's Kobe steak is the real deal.

'We had two people fly in from Japan's National Federation of Agricultural Co-operative Associations to see the meat, to ensure it have arrived properly, and was being served correctly,' Mr Sherry explained.

Kobe beef in Japan is a 
registered trademark of the Kobe Beef Marketing & Distribution 
Promotion Association, and must fulfill seven strict conditions in order
for a restaurant or supplier to label it as such.

Patented and pricey: Real Kobe beef on sale at a
price of $180 per kilo in Japan, it is known for its renowned flavour, 
tenderness, and fatty, well-marbled texture

The virtues of Kobe, which refers to 
cuts of beef from the Tajima-ushi breed of Wagyu cattle, considered a 
delicacy and renowned for its flavour and tenderness, has been regularly 
touted by famous chefs and on menus all over the country.

While Wagyu is a broad term which literally means Japanese cattle, Kobe is the term which is used for beef actually raised in the province of Kobe.

Under
Japanese law, for a beef to be labelled Kobe, it can only came from the Hyogo prefecture, where 
no slaughterhouses were approved for export from 2010 until August 2012 by the United States 
Department of Agriculture.

And despite the fact that Kobe Beef, 
Meat, and Cattle are patented trademarks in Japan, these Japanese trademarks are 
neither recognised nor protected by U.S. law.

Similar to the label 'natural' on many U.S. products, a term also unregulated in America, Kobe is an adjective which has been used by restaurants mainly to confuse consumers and profit from their confusion.

However real Kobe beef is produced under
some of the world’s strictest legal food standards, contributing to the
$350 cost of the The Old Homestead Steakhouse's authentic Kobe steak.

were born in the Hyogo prefecture, raised on local grasses since its 
birth, and have a 10 digit ID

'I can only equate it with having a great bottle of wine. You would pay $300 to taste the best possible red, much like you would for the best steak in the world,' said Mr Sherry.

He added: 'Buying Japanese beef is about ten to 15 times the cost of buying American beef, and that's where most of our overheads come in. But it's not about the money, it's just about enabling the public to try this exquisite piece for meat.'

According to the Kobe patent, in order 
to label a cut of meat Kobe, it must have come from a pure lineage of 
Tajima-gyu breed cattle. However in the U.S., Japanese cattle which were
imported before the 2010 ban are crossbred with American cattle, which 
has translated into a Kobe-style product.

Must be pure-bred Tajima calf born in Hyōgo Prefecture

Farm fed only from grains and water from Hyōgo Prefecture

Castrated bull or virgin cow, to purify the beef

Processed at slaughterhouses in Kobe, Nishinomiya, Sanda, Kakogawa and Himeji in Hyōgo Prefecture only

Marbling ratio, called BMS, of level 6 and above

Meat Quality Score of 4 or 5

Gross weight of beef from one animal is 470kg or less

The cow must also have been born in the Hyogo prefecture, raised on local grasses, water and soil since its birth. It must be a bull or virgin cow, and it must be processed in a Hyogo slaughterhouse, which for two years have not been able to be exported to the U.S., until now.

There are only 3000 head of certified Kobe Beef cattle in the world, and each of them live in Japan.

The process is so strict that when the beef is sold, either in stores or restaurants, it must carry the 10-digit identification number so customers know what particular Tajima-gyu cow it came from.

But as an unregulated term, the American government has enabled vendors to misuse the Kobe name, charging customers high prices under false pretenses. However with the ban now lifted, hopefully this will change.

And while the American Kobe-style beef is usually raised all-natural, antibiotic-free, hormone-free, and fed a vegetarian diet, it has nothing in common with actual Kobe beef except that it comes from cows.

Restaurants currently have no legal obligation to label it as such, easily justifying a price tag to match the wool pulled over consumers eyes.

Mr Sherry, who is excited about being one of the first American restaurants to serve the real deal, said: 'We'll continue to serve it as long as the demand is there.

'It’s a food experience of orgasmic proportions – really,' he added.

Diners who order the pricey dish will also be able to take home an inscribed plate as a token of their experience.
