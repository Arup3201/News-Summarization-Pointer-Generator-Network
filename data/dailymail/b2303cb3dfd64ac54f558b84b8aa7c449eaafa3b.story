Australia's first pizza vending machine has landed in Sydney, and the $12 treats have been such a hit the owner is already thinking about rolling more machines out.

The brains behind the $40,000 Pizza Gio is George Pompei, who owns Pompei's pizza and pasta restaurant in Bondi Beach.

He was inspired when he was traveling in Italy and came across a similar concept.

Mr Pompei admits he was sceptical at first, concerned that a machine wouldn't be able to produce a pizza that met the high standards he was used to at his restaurant.

'I wanted to be assured that the machine could actually develop pizzas that tasted fresh and delicious,' Mr Pompei told Daily Mail Australia.

However after nearly two years of developing the machine and months of rigorous testing he finally had a product that was up to the task.

'Once the machine was developed it took six months of testing until we were happy with the product,' he explained.

'We use stone ground flour, natural yeast, extra virgin olive oil and sea salt and rest the dough for 48 hours before it is then rolled out and topping is added.'

The options for the $12 pizza are Hot Salami and Margarita however more flavours are on there way with an addition of a second machine being introduced

Order your pizza in three simple steps using the touch-screen monitor then wait three minutes for your pizza.

The pizzas are par-baked in a stone oven before being blast chilled and stocked in the vending machines.

They take three minutes to cook and customers can choose from either hot salami or margarita toppings.

And if you're concerned that the pizzas are sitting in the vending machines gathering dust, there's no need to worry. The machine is restocked daily and if it sells out before the day's end, a message is sent to Mr Pompei's restaurant who will then send someone to top it up.

The Pizza Gio has been so popular in Chatswood there are plans to open another one with alternative toppings.

But pizza lovers around Sydney don't need to worry that they're missing out for much longer. Mr Pompei hopes to roll out more vending machines across the city.

The pizza machine is restocked with fresh bases and toppings daily to ensure freshness.

Despite his assurances that the 3 minute pizzas are as good as those you can buy in his restaurant, he doesn't see the Pizza Gio as a threat.

'They're aimed more at people wanting something to eat on the go rather than someone wanting a proper meal.'

'We've been overwhelmed with the support we've gotten. We're thinking of actually having a competition so that people can tell us where they'd like the next machine to be put,' Mr Pompei said.
