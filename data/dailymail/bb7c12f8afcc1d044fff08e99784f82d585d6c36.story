Girls as young as 11 'expect' to have to 
perform sex acts on rows of boys for up to two hours at a time in parts 
of London, a shocking report has warned.

Child abuse is rife across Britain with many of the depraved sex attacks
 being carried out by youngsters who have had their minds warped by 
online porn, a government expert said yesterday.

Deputy Children’s Commissioner Sue Berelowitz said there 'isn’t a town, 
village or hamlet in which children are not being sexually exploited’.

And she said easy access to ‘extreme’ internet porn was to blame as it 
‘affected children’s thresholds of what they think is normal’.

They are then ‘enacting’ scenes from porn movies – often as part of gangs which subject young girls to terrible abuse.

Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee, Miss Berelowitz told of her 
great concern about what internet porn was doing to vulnerable young 
minds.

She explained: ‘We’ve had boys say to us – some of the boys I’ve spoken 
to who’ve been involved in sexual exploitation – “it was like being in a
 porn movie”.

‘They have watched things and then they’ve enacted them. It has 
definitely affected children’s thresholds of what they think is normal.’

In one vile case she uncovered, boys aged 14 and 15 were 'summoned' via 
BlackBerry Messenger to the gang rape of a 'very, very young girl' which
 lasted several days.

She told MPs: 'Boys were being called 
while some were raping the girl to say "come, come, come, you can join 
in too" and they were arriving and elbowing each other out of the way to
 rape her.'

And giving examples from the capital, she added: 'There are parts of 
London where certainly children expect to have to perform oral sex on 
line-ups of boys, up to two hours at a time from the age of 11.

And it was 'quite common' for girls to be lured via internet chat rooms 
to meet a friend, only to be met by a group of boys and gang raped in a 
park.

'Then another group of boys come, they take her to another part of the 
park and she is serially raped again,' Ms Berelowitz told MPs.

'I wish I could say to you that such things are uncommon but I’m afraid they are quite common.'
In another case, older men were using young male gang members as a 
'front line' in a wider abuse network, and had even forced two of the 
boys to have sex and filmed it on a mobile phone to ensure their 
compliance.

The deputy commissioner, appointed to look after the best interests of 
children, backed the Mail’s campaign for controls to make it harder for 
youngsters to access pornographic images on computers.

MPs, charities and this paper want a new 
‘opt-in’ system – where access to porn is normally blocked by the 
internet service provider, unless parents specifically request 
otherwise. Miss Berelowitz told MPs this move would be the right way to 
make a ‘start’.

She said parents needed to recognise children could access porn from 
home computers and mobiles, and they alone would not be able to control 
successfully what young people could see.

Ms Berelowitz  said: 'Parents may think they can control what’s going on
 because they can have a blockage on the computer but the reality is 
children can get anything they like on their mobile phones.

'And they are. It has definitely affected children’s thresholds of what they think is normal.'

Currently, the opt-in system is being resisted by internet companies, 
who make millions from adverts for pornographic websites. Ministers, who
 have been criticised for their close ties to companies such as Google, 
have yet to reach a final decision.

Sue Berelowitz's report into the scale of child abuse is due out in September

Her comments will increase the pressure on ministers to take drastic action to protect children from damaging images online.

During her evidence she said: 'What I am uncovering is that sexual exploitation of children is happening all over the country.

'As one police officer who was the lead in a very big investigation in a very lovely, leafy, rural part of the country said to me: "there isn’t a town, village or hamlet in which children are not being sexually exploited".

'We should start from the assumption that children are being sexually exploited right the way across the country.

'In urban, rural and metropolitan areas, I have hard evidence of children being sexually exploited. That is part of what is going on in some parts of our country. It is very sadistic, it is very violent it is very ugly.'

The deputy commissioner told the visibly-stunned MPs that 'what is being done is so terrible that people need to lay aside their denial' or risk victims being disbelieved.

Victims numbered in the thousands not the hundreds, she said.

She said she was 'extremely concerned' about the role being played by the internet in enabling and fuelling abuse, and ridiculed the idea that parents could prevent access.

Young people were acting out scenes they saw in online pornography and even organising abuse via social networking sites and messaging systems, she said.

One police force showed her a list of more than 1,000 girls aged between 12 and 14 whom a man in his 40s masquerading as a boy had managed to make his 'friends' on Facebook.

'We have gathered quite a lot of evidence to show that there is no doubt that social networking sites can be a source of real problems for this,' she said.

Her report into the scale of child abuse is due out in September.

She also talked about recent high-profile cases of groups of men exploiting young white girls for sex.

In
 one case in Rochdale, nine Muslim men, mainly of Pakistani origin, were
 found guilty of plying girls as young as 13 with drink and drugs so 
they could use them for sex.

But
 while it may be true that some Pakistani men saw white girls as 'easy 
meat' - as suggested by a number of high-profile politicians - that was 
only one pattern among many, she said.

'I
 regret to say that there are parts of every single community - white, 
Pakistani, Afghan, Gypsy and Romany travellers, you name it - who are 
seeing children as easy access in terms of sexual exploitation. And in 
terms of victims we are seeing the same sort of profile.'

Speaking about the race issue, she 
told the committee she had visited a 'racist' estate in the north of 
England where there was routine sexual abuse of children within an 
all-white community.

'I have been to gang-associated areas in the north of England.

'I am thinking of one particular 
estate which is exclusively white, because it is such a racist estate, 
where there is a very strong and identified pattern of the white males 
on that estate sexually exploiting the white females on that estate.

'So it is really important to hold all of it in mind.'

Peter Davies, chief executive of the 
Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, has warned that 
children are accessing the web at a far younger age, meaning they could 
stumble across adult material.

His organisation is now distributing 
films to schools aimed at children between the ages of five and eight, 
to train them how to avoid online dangers.

In his evidence to MPs yesterday, Mr 
Davies said he would score the public sector only ‘five out of ten’ for 
its ability to protect children from abuse.

He claimed that, on average, one child in every 20 was the victim of sexual abuse.
