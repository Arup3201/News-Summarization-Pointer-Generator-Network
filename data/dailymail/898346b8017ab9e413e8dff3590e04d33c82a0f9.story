The recent bout of wild weather in California left some Santa Barbara diners with a lot more salt on their breakfast than they intended when a huge wave broke right through a seaside restaurant's windows.

Many locals headed to the Moby Dick Restaurant to catch a front-row seat to the Saturday morning storm that was expected to bring a big swell at high tide.

Video captured by diners shows one smaller swell sloshing up against the windows, to the excited murmur of diners.

The next wave, however, came with such force that it smashed in the windows and came flooding into the restaurant.

Screams and the sound of breaking glass can be heard and a person asks, 'Are you OK?' before the video ends.

Diner Forrest Buchanan, who filmed the wave, described the incident.

'The dining room was filled with the
 sound of glass shattering and people screaming as a wave of water 
rushed over the dining room carpet,' he said.

Another
 diner, Jill Freeland, told NoozHawk that she and her family had just 
finished breakfast at 9:30am when the wash crashed into the restaurant.

'I really didnâ€™t expect it to break,' Freeland told Noozhawk. 'Another swell beforehand came pretty close. We were just expecting some excitement. You never know with swell and tide.'

No one was seriously injured in the incident, and all patrons were safely evacuated from the restaurant.

Buchanan says he asked the manager if it was OK if he did not pay for the few bites of eggs he'd managed before the wave hit and quickly evacuated with the other patrons.

The National Weather Service had issued a high surf advisory Saturday in Santa Barbara.
