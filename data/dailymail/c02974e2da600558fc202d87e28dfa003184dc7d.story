This week the pop diva presented us with a cropped, curved fringe 

She has a flawless face, curvaceous figure and high-fashion style — not to mention millions of fans — so it’s little wonder that when pop star Beyonce debuts a new look, it sparks a wave of imitations.

Yet the 33-year-old this week presented us with a hairstyle only the bold will seek to emulate: a cropped, curved fringe spookily reminiscent of Friar Tuck.

Even her most ardent admirers were horrified. What had possessed Beyonce to hack her tumbling caramel waves so severely?

Well, it seems that she may not have been brave, or silly, enough to go for the chop after all. The offending fringe’s only saving grace seems to be that hairdressers believe it is in fact a ‘winge’ — or a fringe wig.

‘I have no doubt that, in Beyonce’s case, the fringe is a wig. A badly positioned, untidy, fringe wig,’ says celebrity stylist Andrew Barton. 

‘Winges are really popular on the catwalks, with some designers sending armies of models down the runway with identical ones clipped in, but Beyonce’s is all wrong.

'Had it been straight, sleek and perfectly groomed, it could have been a bold and fashionable statement. Instead, the look is a dry, bristly broom — more Goon Show than fashion show.’

Fringe wigs are roughly 6in long sections of hair with clips attached to them, which can be used to attach the hairpiece to the crown, and are styled to look like natural hair.

While they may sound — and often look — utterly bizarre, they have been growing in popularity in Britain over the past six years, since hairdressing chain Hershesons launched them in salons and online.

They are now available for as little as £20 from High Street stores such as Topshop, and come in a range of shades to match different hair colours. While the cheaper ones will be made of nylon, and may have an unnatural sheen and texture, for £50 to £70 it is possible to buy one made of human hair.

Beyonce isn’t the only celebrity to road-test a fringe while running shy of taking the chop. 

Actresses Nicole Kidman and Penelope Cruz are both said to have sported clip-in fringes on the red carpet, while reality TV star Kim Kardashian has gushed about her love of fake fringes.

For someone with my chequered history with fringes — I’m still reeling from the hideous pageboy cut my mother inflicted on me when I was six — the prospect of trying a new clip-on look without committing to a radical re-style is far more appealing.

And if it doesn’t work — mentioning no names, Beyonce — you can just take it out. Quick!

Pop diva winge 

How we did it: We used £30 clip-in winges from Daniel Hersheson’s online boutique hershesons.com to give me five very different fringes. 

With this one, the stylist clipped it in place, an inch in front of my crown, and chopped steadily. 

She created an undercut in the fringe, where the top layer is longer than the layers underneath, giving it the appearance of a ledge standing proud of the forehead.

Annabel's verdict: The winge of the moment is not for me — not now, not ever!

I looked in the mirror and was reminded of the time my four-year-old daughter cut her own hair with a pair of nail scissors. 

If this is high fashion, why do I look so frumpy? If I had a stylist, I’d sack her immediately.

Frump: ‘It looked like my four year old had been at it with nail scissors’ says Annabel of the Pop Diva Winge (left), while the eyebrow grazing winge (right) left her flustered after half an hour 

Eyebrow Grazing Winge 

How we did it: This hardly needed any styling. 

The hairdresser simply clipped in the winge and gently cut upwards into it, creating a shattered edge — I could easily do this one at home.

Annabel's verdict: I quite liked peering out from under my fringe in a sultry fashion — and it certainly hides the wrinkles on my forehead. 

But after half an hour I was getting flustered and desperately wanted to scrape my hair away from my face.

Victory Roll Winge 

How we did it: My ingenious hairdresser grabbed an old roller, cut it length-ways and re-rolled it, into a tighter cyclinder. 

She then clipped in the winge, and pinned it around the roller to create a short, tight roll across the top of my forehead.

Annabel's verdict: I wasn’t expecting to love this cartoonish, bubble fringe. 

And, lo and behold . . . I didn’t. It felt totally ridiculous and rather precarious, as the synthetic winge tried to unfurl itself. Unflattering and frankly silly, there’s no way I’d try this one again.

Side Sweep Winge 

How we did it: The hairdresser took a winge and clipped it in on at a slight angle, along the line of my parting. In order to conceal the join, she resorted to craftily pinning pieces of my own hair over the top.

Annabel's verdict: When you live behind a curtain of thick hair, as I do, this kind of half fringe is good for softening your look. I don’t think I could style it

Long Blunt Winge 

How we did it: The stylist gave my own hair a centre-parting, and clipped the winge high, close to my crown. Then she set about cutting it bluntly and drastically, so it sat half an inch or so above my eyebrows.

Annabel's verdict: I’ve always secretly admired the iconic style of Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction, and wondered whether I could pull of that very blunt fringe. 

This settles that debate. It looks awful, highlighting my strong jaw. I’d have to wear huge amounts of make-up to look remotely glamorous.

Fancy a boiled egg? 

Bored of your daily lunchtime sandwich? How about a fresh boiled egg with a perfectly soft yolk, brewed in the office kettle?

Place your egg in the kettle and cover it with an inch of water. The important thing is to keep the egg away from the heating element so you will need to tilt the kettle at an angle — try putting a pad of Post-it notes beneath one side of it. This will keep the egg clear of the metal element.

Boil the kettle. 

When it turns itself off, start a timer (on your mobile phone if you don’t have an egg timer to hand) and leave your egg in the kettle for 12 minutes.

Then drain the water away very carefully and take your egg out. Let it cool for a minute or two and it’s ready to eat.

Do be careful as you’re doing it not to scald yourself. And don’t be surprised if your colleagues object to their cups of tea taking on a slightly sulphurous taste.
