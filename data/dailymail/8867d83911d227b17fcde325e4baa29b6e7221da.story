Froze to death: Dental nurse Bernadette Lee, 25, died after a night out in snowy weather

A young dental nurse tragically froze to death yards from her sister's house after finding herself locked out after a night out.

Bernadette Lee, 25, who was wearing a short dress, had no coat and had taken her shoes off, was found lying dead in the snow near to her older sister Jodie's house on January 19.

An inquest heard how she had been due to stay with a friend after the Saturday night out but they became separated.

Bernadette then made her way to her sister's house but unknown to her, Jodie, 33, had lost her keys and was staying elsewhere so there was no-one to let her in.

Her mobile phone showed she made 27 calls in her final hours desperately trying to contact friends but they ended at 3.51am.

A report from Kent Police, read to the inquest, said Miss Lee had been drinking at a friend's house and later went to a nightclub.

She had intended to spend the night at her friend Cheryl Coley's house but became separated from the group.

At 2.30am she got a lift with three other people to Middle Deal Road in Deal, Kent. They went into a house without her, while Miss Lee tried to call Miss Coley.

The inquest heard that between 1.54am and 3.17am she had called her friend four times but Miss Coley later told police she had had a row with her partner and had been constantly on the phone during that time.

There was evidence Miss Lee had tried to call her dad Roger on his mobile but that was switched off. She had also tried to call 'numerous' other friends.

Miss Coley told police she had a 'special friendship' with Miss Lee who knew she could turn up at any time and stay.

As temperatures plunged to minus 2C Miss Lee lay down in the snow and died from hypothermia.

Her body was found by a dog walker at
 7.50am on a lawn in Deal, Kent. He initially thought he had seen a 
mannequin lying in the snow before realising it was a body.

He noticed she didn't have a coat on, was only wearing a dress, and he saw a mobile phone on the ground nearby.

He shook Bernadette's body, thinking she might be asleep, before realising she appeared to be dead and dialled 999.

The
 North East Kent coroner heard she had a high level of alcohol in her 
body which would have put her at higher risk of hypothermia.

A post mortem showed there was no sign of any violence or injury to the body.

After the inquest Bernadette's 
family, from Canterbury, Kent said her death could have been 'so easily 
avoided' and begged partygoers to take care in cold temperatures.

Her
 father Roger, 63, and sister Jodie said: 'We hate the thought of other 
families ever having to go through such a harrowing ordeal.

'We would like to say to everyone please don't put yourself in a situation where you are totally dependent on someone else as things can go wrong.

'Always take a coat in the winter as plans can so easily change.

'If you arrange for someone to stay with you then please be responsible and remember that their lives could depend on you.'

Jodie added: 'My sister Bernie was such a lovely girl and she didn't deserve to die like this.'

While Mr Lee said: 'I'm devastated. My life will never be the same again. I brought her up by myself and we were very close.

'We could speak for hours and hours on the phone. She was a beautiful girl and very intelligent.

'I loved her so much - everybody did. She was a very popular girl, a lovely girl.

'Bernadette's friend said she had had a lot to drink and that she was wearing a dress with no coat.

'That was typical of Bernadette. She always wanted to look good when she went out.'

The inquest was told she died of hypothermia and alcohol intoxication.

Coroner Rebecca Cobb recorded a 
verdict of misadventure and explained: 'That is similar to an accident 
but it means there were aspects of her behaviour that were involved in 
her death, like the alcohol she had consumed.'
