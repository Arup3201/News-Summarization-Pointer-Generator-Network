She's the make-up artist that gave Amal Clooney her bridal beauty and Kim Kardashian her flawless glow so it's hardly surprising that Abbey Clancy wanted a bit of Charlotte Tilbury's make-up magic.

The model was treated to a live makeover by Charlotte, who is also Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss' beauty guru of choice, at Selfridges Exchange Square, Manchester.

Charlotte treated Abbey to The Supermodel look; a look inspired by all the supermodels that she has worked with - and she's shared her step-by-step guide to getting the look with FEMAIL.

Beauty buddies: Abbey was treated to a live makeover by Charlotte Tilbury at Selfridges Exchange Square, Manchester yesterday. Here, she shares her tips and tricks with FEMAIL ahead of Christmas party season

Describing the look, Charlotte said: 'Inspired by the heavenly supermodels of the 1990's and the trailblazing icons of today’s catwalk, from Linda, Cindy, Claudia, Helena and Naomi, to Kate, Cara, Jourdan, Joan and Miranda.  

'The Supermodel is channelling the legendary make-up of these perfect, glamazon women who understand the power of the ultimate smoky eye paired with a sultry nude lip look.

'The sensuous smokey eyes, the killer cheekbones and the glossy, nude kissable lips that we all want.

'This look is like that chic little black dress that you can always fall back on, every time you put it on, you know you look gorgeous, glamorous and fabulous.'

She began by prepping Abbey's skin with her Magic Cream, which was named by the models backstage at fashion week, followed by her Wonder Glow, foundation and retoucher concealer to give her the mother-of-one a healthy glow.

She then brushed up her brows and used a highlighter just below the arch of her brow.

'This is an old make-up artist trick that accentuates and lifts the brows,' explains Charlotte, before clamping her lashes with her 'push-up bra style eyelash curlers' and slicking on her mascara.

To achieve Abbey's sultry smokey eye, she used her Luxury Eyeshadow Palette in Fallen Angel. 

Priming with a champagne shadow, she then used a beige colour in the corner and applied it using a brush in 'windscreen wiper' motion.

Final touches: She completed the look with lip liner, which, she says, is an essential part of every supermodel's kit

'You can use it wet for a dramatic effect, just pop a little bit of water onto your brush and apply the shadow for a really intense shade,' she adds.

She used eyeliner along the lash line and finished with a little feline flick. 'Smudge some smokey shadow under the eyeline to add width to the eye,' she advises.

She then instructed Abbey to suck in her cheeks so a natural shadow appeared and she applied bronzer there. 

She goes on to explain the importance of lip liner. 'Every supermodel is never without their lipliner' she says before outlining Abbey's lips and slicking on  her K.I.S.S.I.N.G lipstick. 

'Always leave the blusher until last so you never overdo it,' she adds.

Speaking about working with Abbey, she said: 'Abbey is the ultimate Supermodel. She has all the qualities of the divine 90s Amazonian Supermodels - limbs that last forever, sensual smoky eyes, killer cheekbones and heavenly, glossy, nude lips. I love working with her - she’s so lovely and has the perfect features for makeup.'

If you want to emulate Abbey's exact look at home. Charlotte has created a new beauty box packed with the tools and a built-in video tutorial showing you how to apply it.

Final look: Clearly thrilled with the results, Abbey posed for a photoshoot with her new look

The talking video box has been designed to combine the vintage style of a jewellery box and the technological ease of an iPad, so that beauty buffs can watch, learn and apply make-up simply by opening the lid.

As you open the box, a video of Charlotte applying the make-up on a model along with a step-by-step guide begins playing.

The box is also packed with items from Charlotte's make-up collection to help beauty aficionados create The Supermodel look; a look inspired by all the supermodels that she has worked with.

As well as working backstage at the most esteemed fashion shows, Charlotte is credited with transforming the likes of Millie Mackintosh, Suki Waterhouse and Margot Robbie. Poppy Delevingne even called on her to do her bridal make-up for her wedding earlier this year.

So it's fair to say that Charlotte knows a thing or two about beauty. It is perhaps then little surprise that A-lister Kim Kardashian, 33, known for her love of dazzling red carpet looks, called on the make-up maestro to give her a Brit girl makeover when she landed in London recently.

However, looking like an A-lister doesn't come cheap; Charlotte's box will set you back £200. One for the Christmas wish list?
