A 50-year-old man standing on a New Jersey railway platform was struck and killed by a train yesterday evening, and several other passengers were injured.

As the New York-bound express train arrived, Frank Farriella leaned into its path, and was struck and died.Â 

Four people who were standing close to him were injured as body parts were thrown across the platform just before 5pm.

Passengers waiting for the New York train described a cracking noise and screaming as the body of Mr Farriella, from Middlesex, fell back on to other passengers.

Three of the four people injured by the incident had to be taken to hospital, and other witnesses were described by detectives as being covered in blood.

A spokesman for New Jersey Transit told Mail Online witnesses saw Mr Farriella lean over the platform edge and into the path of an express train as it approached.

He was unable to confirm the nature of the injuries that caused Mr Farriella's death, but added that the circumstances of the incident were currently under investigation.

Jill Rice, who was on the platform at the time of the incident, told CBS New York: 'I could see the trail marks; blood, as if somebody was dragged. And then I saw the cell phone, his hat, his gloves.'

A witness, named only as Tony, said: 'I almost thought it was a fight or something, from when the train hit him and knocked him into some people.'

A 64-year-old woman who was waiting 
on the same platform, suffered several fractured ribs after being hit by
 debris in the horrific incident.

An
 83-year-old man was left with back, neck and head injuries, and a 
27-year-old complained of head pain after the tragedy. All three were 
taken to hospital.

A fourth passenger, who was also injured while at the platform, declined medical treatment.

The express train had not been scheduled to stop at New Brunswick. It was passing through the station at the time of the incident, with the next stop scheduled at Newark Airport.

Michael Iaccarino, 
who witnessed the incident, said: 'There was a loud screech and what I would describe as a crack. 
Something that really hurt my ears or pierced my hearing.

'It sounded like it was an express [train] going through, just passing by,' he told ABC 7.

The train that collided with Mr Farriella was carrying 300 people when it came to a stop at New Brunswick station. No one on board was injured, and passengers were transferred to a separate line while an investigation began.

The rush-hour service also experienced delays as investigators tried to determine what had happened.

New Jersey Transit confirmed an investigation was underway, and issued a reminder to customers that they should remain behind the yellow line until the train has arrived.
