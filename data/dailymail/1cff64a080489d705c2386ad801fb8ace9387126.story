Delight: Bamford is raring to go at Middlesbrough 

Boro boss Aitor Karanka – former assistant to Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid - has used his friendship with the Chelsea manager to broker the deal.

There were 10 clubs competing for Bamford’s signature, and the player said: ‘I had a chat with Aitor and spoke to a few other managers about 10 days ago. But after I decided it was Middlesbrough there was a hold-up in the paperwork.

‘It finally got sorted and thankfully I’m here now. Hopefully I can bring goals to the team.

‘Middlesbrough jumped out to me what with the manager’s aspirations and I was just eager to come here and play.’
