A centuries-old mummified head, pictured, once thought to have belonged to a 17th century king has been found to have no royal lineage at all

After three years of tests, a centuries-old mummified head once thought to have belonged to a 17th century king has been found to have no royal lineage at all.

Belgian geneticist Jean-Jacques
Cassiman compared DNA from the embalmed head with three living relatives of the king and found a genetic mismatch, suggesting it can't be him.

This discovery refutes claims made in 2010 by French researchers who used facial reconstruction to determine that the head was that of King Henry IV.

Henry IV was credited with bringing religious peace to France and was responsible for building Parisian landmarks such as the Pont Neuf bridge.

He reigned from 1589 to May 1610, when he was assassinated by a Catholic fanatic.

Henry IV was the first of the Bourbon monarchs and grandfather of King Louis XIV.

Cassiman, from the University of Leuven, wrote in the European Journal of Human Genetic that it is 'impossible' for the head to belong to the French king, but admitted he was not able to determine who it belonged to.

The same study also found a blood sample
previously attributed to King Louis XVI, one of Henry's descendants, 
lacked any royal ties as well.

Louis XVI died during the 
French Revolution and many spectators reportedly soaked their 
handkerchiefs in the king's blood.

However, Cassiman and colleagues found the
lingering traces of powdered blood on the handkerchief they tested did 
not match the Bourbon family DNA either.

The left-hand image is taken from a painting of 
King Henry IV from the 17th Century. The right-hand image shows the 
facial reconstruction, carried out by Philippe Charlier in 2010, of the 
embalmed head. The similarities were used by the original researchers to
determine that the head belonged to the king

Henry IV was credited with bringing 
religious peace to France and was responsible for building Parisian 
landmarks such as the Pont Neuf bridge.Â 

He reigned from 1589 to May 1610, when he was assassinated by a Catholic fanatic.

Henry IV was the first of the Bourbon monarchs and grandfather of the Sun King Louis XIV.

During the French revolution, the royal tombs 
at Saint Denis near Paris were dug up and some accounts claim Henry IV's
head was chopped off and stolen.

Yet Cassiman from the University of Leuven disputes this, claiming Henry is still buried in Saint Denis after the tombs were resealed in 1817.

The DNA from both the head and the handkerchief failed to match 
samples from other royal families on record.

During the revolution, the royal tombs at Saint Denis near Paris were dug up and some accounts claim Henry IV's head was chopped off and stolen.

Cassiman and his co-authors dispute that Henry was decapitated and believe the king is still buried in Saint Denis after the tombs were resealed in 1817.

'That is impossible to verify,' said Michael Rowe, a senior lecturer in European history at King's College London, who was not connected to either study.

He said there wasn't much evidence one way or the other to suggest what happened to Henry's head, but added the king's reputation as one of France's best kings might have saved his body from decapitation: 'If the revolutionaries were going to spare any of the kings, it would have been Henry IV.'

Philippe Charlier, author of the 2010 study that identified the head as Henry IV, dismissed the new research.

He said he and his colleagues have found an exact match between a three-dimensional comparison of the ancient head and Henry IV's death mask and said the work will soon be published in a forensic journal.

Charlier added there were numerous 
doubts about the paternity of various kings in the Bourbon line, which 
might explain why there was no link between the DNA of modern-day 
descendants and the ancient head.

Two years ago, analysis of DNA taken 
by Charlier, from traces of blood found inside a gourd where the 
handkerchief was kept revealed a likely match for someone of Louis XVI's
description, including his blue eyes.

But it was never able to be proved beyond doubt as at the time the team did not have DNA of any royal relation.

These markings on the skull led the scientists to claim it belonged to the king in 2010. However, Cassiman's research claims DNA evidence proves the head doesn't have any royal lineage

Their research uncovered a rare genetic signature shared by two men separated by seven generations, and managed to provide evidence for the authenticity of both sets of remains in the process.

French forensic pathologist Philippe Charlier said: 'This study shows that (the owners of the remains) share a genetic heritage passed on through the paternal line.'

Frank Ruehli, of the University of Zurich and the Swiss Mummy project, agreed there could be questions about paternity in the Bourbon line and also raised concerns about the authenticity of the ancient DNA samples, as he said it was very difficult to get good data from a sample several centuries old.

'The best would be to look at (Henry IV's) heart as well,' he said. 'If you have multiple tissues from the same body showing the same results, that would be a positive identification.'

Ruehli continued that given the lack of complete data, it was impossible to know for sure whom the head belonged to.

Charlier said the mummified head is currently in a Parisian bank vault awaiting reburial but that there are no exact plans yet.
