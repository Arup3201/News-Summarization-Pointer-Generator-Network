There has been a security scare at an AFL training ground in Melbourne after three razor blades were found on the field ahead of Hawthorn's final session before the  grand final.

The open razor blades were located by security staff as they combed the field at Waverly Park in Melbourne's south east before the Hawks players kicked off their training session on Thursday.

Forty staff members were forced to sweep the grounds for more blades just minutes before training was scheduled to start.

The Hawks believe the blades were deliberately planted and could have caused serious damage to a player or fans if they came in contact with the blade

The Hawks believe the blades were deliberately planted and could have caused serious damage to a player if he came in contact with the blade, Nine News reports.

Thousands of fans, many of which were children,  took to the field following the open session and potentially could have been injured by the razors too.

Hawthorn chief executive, Stuart Fox, told the Herald Sun  he was deeply concerned but had ensured no players were in danger when training resumed.

'We can confirm there were some razor blades found and we took immediate action and scoured the ground before the players went out,' he told the newspaper.

'We are fortunate that no one was hurt and disappointed that someone would go to that extreme and put our players in jeopardy.'  

Hawks player Cyril Rioli, who may be recalled from injury to play in Saturday's grand final, was a crowd favourite

The club said they decided not to involve police.

The training ground at Waverley Park  is open to the public so Hawthorn cannot prohibit fans and spectators from entering.

The thousands of fans who turned up to watch the Hawks run through some light match practice were reportedly not aware of security scouring the grounds.

Thursday's training was the final session ahead of the AFL grand final on Saturday against inter-city rivals, the Sydney Swans, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

The Swans kept it low-key on Thursday, running through a closed session at their home ground the Sydney Cricket Ground before flying south. Swans fans thronged to an open training session on Tuesday.

Hawks midfielder Jordan Lewis said that if fans were planning to boo former player Lance  Franklin, they should think again, according to the ABC.

Franklin, a dual premiership star at Hawthorn, quit the club last year to join the Sydney Swans and will now face off against his former team mates on Saturday.

'I'm against that side of the game,' Lewis said at Hawthorn's training session.

'Everyone who comes to the game has their own intentions. We can't stop it. We're not in a position to stop it.

'But you would think a guy who has given us nine years of good service, you'd think there'd be some sort of respect there and not boo him the way we've heard they're going to boo him.

'But I think that spurs him on, he loves the big occasion. He loves proving people wrong and if we go along that path, we might poke the bear.'

Lewis was drafted to Hawthorn in 2004 alongside Franklin and key forward Jarryd Roughead.

They all made their senior debutes the following year.

Since joining Sydney, Franklin won the Coleman Medal and finished joint runner-up in the Brownlow Medal Count.
