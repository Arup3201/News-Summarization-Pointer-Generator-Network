Their bust is your boon.

The town of Bradian in Canada's British Columbia was abandoned in the 1970s when the local gold mine closed, and now it's for sale at just $995,000.

That includes all 50 acres of the mountain hamlet, including 22 empty homes that will need a lot of attention to make habitable again.

The town was established in the 1930s, in the middle of Canada's gold rush, by families who came to work at the nearby Bralorne mine.

Ghost town: The abandoned town of Bradian in Canada's British Columbia has hit the market with an asking price of about $907,000 U.S. dollars 

Abandoned: The small town was established in the 1930s, in the middle of Canada's gold rush, when families flocked to Bradian to work at the nearby Bralorne mine. Above, a 1960s newspaper found on the 50-acre property

Shut down: The town was abandoned in the 1970s when the mine closed and there was no longer any work for the locals

Rural: Bradian is located four hours from Vancouver and two hours from ski-resort Whistler. It includes 50 acres of property and 22 abandoned homes

For 40 years, the mine was one of the biggest gold producers in Canada, turning out $4million ounces of the precious metal.

But the mine closed in 1971 when the price of gold dropped and the operators couldn't turn a profit.

By the end of the 70s, the town was completely abandoned and the homes fell into disrepair.

In 1997, Vancouver couple Tom and Katherine Gutenberg, senior flight attendants for Air Canada, bought the town as a fun project for their family.

Investment: Current owners Tom and Katherine Gutenberg, senior flight attendants for Air Canada, bought Bradian in 1997

Bonding: The Gutenbergs spent vacations and holidays at the property, working to fix it up with their two young children

'When he saw the town was falling apart, Tom thought, "Wouldn’t it be great for the family to save the town?"' listing agent John Lovelace told FoxNews.com.

Now that their two children are grown up though, the Gutenbergs rarely visit the town, and decided to put it up for sale.

Bradian was originally listed in 2010 with an asking price of $1.3million.

They recently dropped the price to $995,000 - or $907,0000 in U.S. dollars - and have seen a flurry of interest in the unique property.

Moving on: Now that their children have grown, the Gutenbergs don't visit Bradian often and decided to put it up for sale

Discount: Bradian was initially listed in 2010 for $1.3million, but the owners bumped that price down recently 

Excitement: The real estate agent says he's received more than 30 calls from people interested in the property - some even as far away as Australia 

Promising: Lovelace says the property will take a lot of work to make habitable again, but it could prove a cash cow for whoever invests the money into it

Potential: Lovelace thinks Bradian would be a great place to start a snowmobiling company

Lovelace says he's received more than 30 calls, emails and texts from people interested in the property - with some as far away as Australia.

However, Lovelace has not been shy about how much work the property needs.

'If somebody went in there with some money and they got the services up to speed and created those (vacant) lots, they’d make a crap load of money. But that’s a five to 10-year process,' he said.

Lovelace hopes another young couple will take interest in the property in the same way the Gutenbergs did. He says it would also make a great location for a snowmobiling company.

Bradian is located a four-hour drive from Vancouver and two hours from ski-resort Whistler. However, for nine months of the year, the road to Whistler is impassable, making it a four-hour drive as well.

Bradian isn't the only town to hit the real estate market in recent months.

Back in June, the town of Swett, South Dakota was listed for $400,000.
