A mother got so angry when told that her daughter had failed a New York state exam that she threatened to bomb the school, police say. 

Karen Shearon pleaded not guilty when she was arraigned on Friday on a misdemeanor aggravated harassment charge.

A court complaint says the 48-year-old told a guidance counselor at Staten Island's Susan Wagner High School on Tuesday she was 'going to blow up the school'.

'Threat': Karen Shearon, 48, allegedly to a high school guidance counselor she would blow up the school

She says a school representative called her at work repeatedly that day.

The Staten Island Advance says Shearon says she 'never made such a phone call' and suggested the school would have been evacuated if she had indeed made such a threat.

The city Department of Education said the school immediately notified police of the threat. 

Students have to pass exams in five core subjects to graduate high school in New York.
