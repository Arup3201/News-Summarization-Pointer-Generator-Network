Britain was handing out around £60million a day in foreign aid towards the end of the year in order to meet David Cameron's target, a report has found.

Taxpayers funded £11.5billion of overseas development projects in 2013 – the first time the Coalition's aim to hand out 0.7pc of GDP to developing countries has been achieved.

But a report has found this involved a major effort by civil servants at the Department for International Development (DfID), who had to increase their spending by a third compared with the previous year.

Taxpayers handed out £60million per day for overseas development projects towards the end of 2013 to meet David Cameron's target

In November and December of that year alone, they had to spent more than £3.7billlion in a last ditch attempt to meet the target – which works out at around £60million every day for those two months.

The National Audit Office, which scrutinises government spending, warn that the strict target could leave civil servants 'feeling pressure' to hand out money to projects which are not needed.

In a report published today, they explain that a shortfall towards the end of the year 'constrained choice' and meant officials 'could only choose activities where funds could be paid out during 2013'.

'It may therefore have missed opportunities to get the best outcomes from this spending', they said. 

DfID did significant preparation work to deal with the increased budget, boosting its workforce, business processes and the ways in which it measures the benefits of aid, the report found. 

In the end, money which was intended to be given to international aid organisations in early 2014 for long-term projects was able to be brought forward and this was within the rules.

But the authors said: 'The need to hit a hard calendar year spending target could increase the risk of staff feeling pressure at year end to payments which are in advance of need.

'The reasons for such payments should be properly documented and authorised. If payments are in advance of need, they are irregular and contrary to HM Treasury rules'.

In 2014 there was also a rush to spending £12billion by the end of year, with a last minute rise required when the economy grew faster than expected.

A DFID spokesman said: 'In 2013 the UK became the first G7 country to meet the UN target to spend 0.7 per cent of GNI on ODA. 

'Investing in overseas development is creating a world that is healthier, more stable and increasingly prosperous and that is something Britain can be proud of. UK aid goes only where it is most needed and where it will deliver the very best results for taxpayers' money. 

'Using available GNI estimates, DFID sets a clear strategy each year to deliver its ODA target and works with HMT to monitor and manage this through the year. It is normal practice and good financial management for organisations to take stock of priorities and emerging pressure through the year. 

'The nature of issues that DFID deals with, including humanitarian emergencies, means it is important to retain this flexibility.'
