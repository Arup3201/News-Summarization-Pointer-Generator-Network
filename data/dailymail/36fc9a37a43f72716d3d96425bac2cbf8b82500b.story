He was on track for victory in the world’s most famous steeplechase.

Across The Bay was leading the field in the 167th Grand National yesterday with two miles to go. But then calamity struck.

Spectators gasped as the ten-year-old gelding was knocked off course by a stray runner.

Tidal Bay suddenly careered across his path, forcing him to the side of the track.

The
 loose horse crashed through a guard rail but Across The Bay’s jockey, 
Henry Brooke, managed to stay in the saddle and continue the race, 
finishing 14th.

The mishap 
was a disaster for thousands of punters who had placed around £1million 
on the horse, which started the race at odds of 50-1.

There
 was a flurry of angry messages on Twitter after the horse’s chance of 
victory at Aintree was destroyed in a moment of mayhem in front of a 
sell-out crowd of 71,500.

But the day belonged to outsider Pineau de Re, which thrilled spectators with a storming finish.

Trainer Richard Newland, a Worcestershire GP, had entered the 11-year-old in the National for the first time.

The
 race was also a triumph for jockey Leighton Aspell, 37, who came out of
 retirement five years ago and has enjoyed his best season to date.

‘It’s
 a wonderful day,’ he said. ‘I have been watching the National since I 
was a very young boy. It’s what we’re here for. I think you crave it 
inside.’

Dr Newland, 50, only stopped holding surgeries a year ago when he and his wife Laura decided to take up training full-time.

He said: ‘Leighton had a plan and delivered it superbly well. He’s a great guy and a good jockey and I’m thrilled for him.’

Owner John Provan said: ‘We love taking on the big guys.’

Pineau
 de Re’s victory provoked a sigh of relief from Britain’s bookies, who 
feared being wiped out if either of the favourites – Balthazar King or 
Double Seven – had won.

 Rebecca Taylor, head of campaigns at the League Against Cruel Sports, 
said: ‘Of course we are relieved that no horses died, but there were
