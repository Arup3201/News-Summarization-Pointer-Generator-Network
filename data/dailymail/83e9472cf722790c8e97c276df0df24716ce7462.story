A kind-hearted employee at a Florida grocery store has won plaudits online after recently going out of his way to help an elderly shopper.

The incident happened last week at a Publix store in Ormond Beach when an employee called Gage, his surname hasn't been revealed, generously got down and tied the undone shoelace of an older gentleman who was doing his weekly shop.

Gage’s random act of kindness was spotted by another shopper, Keith Kiel, who captured the moment and was so impressed that he posted it on the Publix Facebook page as a tribute to the young man’s kindness.

'An old man could not reach down to tie his shoe, so not only did Gage tie the one [untied shoe], but the other one as well. All with a smile,' Kiel posted on Facebook along with the photo.

Kiel told 11Alive that Gage offered the customer a helping hand after he noticed that he was having trouble bending down to tie his shoelaces.

'I snapped this because it was so unusual to see this in a person,' he said.

The image – and Gage’s good deed – has really caught on and since the photo was posted on August 9, it has been liked more than 190,000 times, shared over 15,000 times and received over 7,500 overwhelming positive comments.
