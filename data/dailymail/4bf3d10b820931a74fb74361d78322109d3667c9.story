A venomous snake escaped from its enclosure at London Zoo, reports today suggest.

The Sri Lankan pit viper made its bid for freedom by slipping out of a vivarium - which is similar to a tank - kept in London Zoo's reptile building.

Thankfully, the young creature - whose venom can cause renal and cardiac failure - was recaptured by a keeper who spotted it slithering away.

Great escape: A Sri Lankan pit viper made a bid for freedom from its enclosure at London Zoo - but was captured by a zookeeper. The tourist attraction failed to notify the local council of its escape, reports suggest

The zoo did not report the escape - which took place in August 2012 - to Camden Council, the Evening Standard has reported.

A 2013 inspection report reveals that the council claim this failure was a 'serious breach' of the organisation's responsibilities to the local area.

Other concerns regarding safety at the zoo were highlighted in the report.

The safety of electrical wiring surrounding the site - including a broken wire on the spider monkey area was one of the issues.

The tanks where carpet pythons are kept were found to be too small for the size of the creature, inspectors found.

The report added that the zoo's emergency escape plan was 'confusing and overcomplicated'.

The zoo - which was granted its new licence just yesterday - said all of the concerns raised in the report have since been dealt with.

Overall, inspectors from the Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs, said they were 'impressed' by their findings.

It added the health of the animals was  of top standard - and the knowledge of the zookeepers was 'excellent'.

Zoological Director David Field said: 'ZSL London Zoo is subjected to regular inspections as part of its zoo license, the most recent of which observed that the animals all appeared to be in excellent health and that ZSL "well exceeds the industry standards" for its conservation efforts. 

A 2013 DEFRA inspection report also revealed other concerns regarding the Zoos electrical safety measures and escape routes. The Zoo, pictured, said it has dealt with all the issues raise

'ZSL London Zoo’s staff work closely with the inspection team to address any queries and responds to all recommendations from the inspection, making changes immediately or as soon as is possible. 

'ZSL London Zoo’s new zoo license was issued on Thursday 19 June 2014 with all of the conditions that were highlighted in the October 2013 inspection addressed.'

The Sri Lankan pit viper - or trimeresurus trigonocephalus - is endemic to Sri Lanka.

The creature is typically green and black in colour and is a 'category one' animal - i.e. the most dangerous type of snake.

They measure 20–25 cm at birth with males growing to a maximum of 60–75 cm.

The viper is both arboreal - i.e. lives mainly in trees - and nocturnal. When it does venture on to the ground, it does so to catch prey such as lizards, frogs, birds and other small mammals.

Its venom causes severe pain and swelling of the bitten area as well as blistering around the bite for several days.

In some victims it can cause renal and cardiac failure - but no fatalities have been reported.
