Pensioners are now better off than almost 60 per cent of the entire population, while young people have seen a slump in their fortunes.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s people in their early twenties had more disposable income than most, but over several decades their comfortable position has been steadily eroded, according to research by the Financial Times.

At the same time, older people are now better off than most, as the Tories seek to woo the grey vote ahead of the general election.

David Cameron was yesterday forced to deny he was putting wealthy OAPs ahead of struggling families and young people.

He repeated his 2010 pledge to cut Winter Fuel Payments, free bus passes, TV licences, prescriptions and eye tests for wealthy pensioners.

But at a time when deep cuts are needed to the welfare bill, critics accuse the Prime Minister of targeting the working poor while protecting the well-off in retirement.

According to the FT research, people aged 20-25 on average incomes after housing were better off than more than 60 per cent of the population.

But dramatic shifts in their fortunes mean they are now only better off than 40 per cent of people.

By contrast, people aged 65-69, who were more comfortable than just 20 per cent of people in the 1960s and 1970s now have more disposable income than almost 60 per cent.

It suggests Baby Boomers born in the 1940s are the luckiest generation, enjoying high standards of living in their teens continue today.

The relative wealth of pensioners has led to calls for them to bear their share of public spending cuts.

David Cameron was yesterday forced to deny he was putting wealthy OAPs ahead of struggling families and young people as he announced pensioner benefits would be protected from cuts

Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute for Economic Affairs think tank, said: 'Politicians must stop trying to woo elderly voters at the expense of other generations.

'The elderly cannot remain immune to public spending restraint and abolishing these benefits would help ease the burden on the working age population.'

The Tories hope that the promise to protect £7.5billion in pensioner benefits will secure the support of older voters.

Mr Cameron claimed people in retirement cannot adjust their incomes if benefits are cut, whereas younger people could find extra work.

In a speech in Hastings yesterday, the PM said: 'We need to make sure that we are fair as we reduce the deficit, we need to make sure the richest pay the most - and they have and they will in future.

'The fact is, if something happens to you when you're old, or to your income, you can't as easily change your circumstances as younger people can.

'You can't as easily move house, or change job, or go full time. You need to know support is always there for you - and that's another reason why I want to protect these benefits.'

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has accused the Tories of targeting the working poor for cuts while protecting pensioners

But the idea has been slammed by the Lib Dems, who want to remove winter fuel payments and TV licences from higher rate tax paying pensioners but continue the pensioner bus pass, free prescriptions or eye tests for all.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'That is the Tory policy - tough on the weak but soft on the strong. Nothing asked of rich pensioners but working age poor to be hammered.'

Liberal Democrat Pensions minister Steve Webb added: 'The working age poor will pay the price for the Conservative ring fence for the very wealthiest pensioners.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'At a time when we're trying to find savings everywhere else in government, it's hard to shake the suspicion that austerity stops at 65.

'The extraordinary debt that politicians have racked up will weigh very heavily on our children and grandchildren, and continuing these policies into the next Parliament will only add to that potentially back-breaking burden.'
