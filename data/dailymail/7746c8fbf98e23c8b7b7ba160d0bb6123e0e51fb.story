You too can live like the 6-foot-8 Knicks star, where high ceilings are an absolute must, for a cool $12 million.

Sound steep? You haven't see the gorgeous sunsets over the park.

The big ticket price also affords a lucky buyer five gorgeous bedrooms and an address on Manhattan's posh Fifth Avenue, home to some of the world's wealthiest and most famous power players.
