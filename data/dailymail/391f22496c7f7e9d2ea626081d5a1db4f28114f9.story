More than 10,000 mourners yesterday paid their respects to a spiritual leader that led a campaign to build one of Britain's biggest mosques.

Sufi Muhammed Abdullah Khan, a Sunni leader originally from Pakistan, was given the privilege of burial inside the place of worship he founded, the giant Central Jamia Masjid Ghamkol Mosque in Birmingham.

Following his death last Thursday, aged 92, tributes were paid to him as a spiritual leader, an inspiration, a good friend and a 'pillar of the community'.

Spiritual leader: Sufi Muhammed Abdullah Khan who was buried yesterday in a huge service attended by 10,000 Muslims at the giant Central Jamia Masjid Ghamkol Mosque in Small Heath, Birmingham

Paying respects: Crowds flock to touch Sufi Abdullah's coffin as it is carried to his final resting place. He was given the rare honour of burial inside the grounds of the mosque, which campaigned to build 

After planning permission was secured seven years ago in preparation for his passing, Sufi Abdullah was laid to rest in a mausoleum inside the grounds of the Small Heath mosque.

One of the largest mosques in Britain, the funeral nevertheless had worshippers and mourners spilling out of the door, with thousands paying their respects in the car park and a nearby community centre.

Surrounding roads were jammed by the event, which mosque leaders said was attended by 10,000 people. At the end of the funeral service, crowds  flocked to catch a glimpse of Sufi Abdullah's coffin, chanting 'God is great' as it was carried to his burial place.

Mosque chairman Raja Saleem Akhtar said: 'In every sense he was our guide, our leader and our friend. He built this up. He was working in a foundry six-days-a-week and in the community for the rest of the time.'

Braving the cold: The Central Jamia Masjid Ghamkol Mosque is one the largest mosques in Britain, but funeral still had thousands of mourners paying their respects in the car park and a nearby community centre

Devotion: Surrounding roads were jammed by the event, which mosque leaders said was attended by 10,000

Pillar of the community: Originally from Pakistan, Sufi Abdullah came to Britain in 1962 to help organise Muslim worship among the thousands of new arrivals to the Birmingham from the Indian subcontinent

A spokesperson for the mosque also said: 'Over 10,000 people attended from all over UK for the funeral of Sufi Muhammad Abdullah Khan Sahib which highlights a clear acceptance of the passing away of an important figure within Islam not only for Birmingham but the whole of UK and Europe.

'Thousands from the community came together united for this beautiful occasion to pay their respects for a man who has dedicated his whole life to serve others and the religion of Islam.

'Sufi Abdullah is a man of God whose sincerity and love are universally witnessed.

'The funeral of Sufi Abdullah was definitely a historic day. It was by God's will and bounty that Sufi Sahib's farewell from this world was a grand occasion.'

Inside the mosque: Hundreds of men were crowded into the building to see Sufi Abdullah's funeral

Sufi Abdullah served in the British Indian Army during the Second World War, including years held by the Germans as a prisoner of war. Always devout, when he left the army in 1962 he accepted a mission to Birmingham to help newly arrived immigrants from the Indian subcontinent to organise their faith and proselytise in their new country.

His name indicates that he was a follower of Sufism, Islam's mystical tradition. Followers of the philosophy, which is opposed by fundamentalist Muslims, believe they can become closer to God through ascetism, meditation, dance and prayer, as well as pilgrimages to the shrines of Sufi saints.

Also described by followers as 'Hazrat', an honorific of high regard, Sufi Abdullah led the £4million fundraising campaign towards the cost of the mosque that has become his burial place.

He was also instrumental in developing the neighbouring community centre and a nearby hostel for the homeless.

Local councillor Zaker Choudhry said: 'We are proud of our founder, his wonderful work and his message of peace, love and harmony. He was a pillar of the community.'
