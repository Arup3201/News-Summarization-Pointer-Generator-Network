Neymar looks set to be fit for Brazil's World Cup quarter-final against Colombia on Friday.

Neymar suffered thigh and knee injuries during Brazil's dramatic win on penalties against Chile on Saturday.

But the 22-year-old Brazil star is making a good recovery, according to team spokesman Rodrigo Paiva.

'The worst is the knee - it's what's hurting the most,' Paiva told reporters at Brazil's training ground in Teresopolis.

'He will be evaluated again, but team doctor Jose Luiz Runco said fans don't have to worry because he's not a concern for the match.'

Neymar undertook a light swimming session with his team-mates on Monday, but he was seen hobbling as he got off the team coach.

The Barcelona forward, who has scored four goals for Brazil at the World Cup, could be rested from training over the next couple of days to aid his recovery.

Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari criticised English referee Howard Webb for not giving Neymar, who scored the winning penalty in Belo Horizonte, more protection against Chile.

'Neymar needs to be valued for what he did because it was a big effort,' Scolari said.

'He played 75 minutes of the match after a strong hit on the thigh and we couldn't understand how somebody hits with that strength and gets no card.'
