Outraged: The attorney for the family of Miriam Carey who was killed by police on Capitol Hill six months ago says her autopsy found she was shot multiple times from behind, including a shot to the back of the head

The family of the Connecticut woman shot dead by police after she tried to ram her car through a barrier to the White House believe officers over-reacted and should be prosecuted.

The autopsy of Miriam Carey, 34, found that she was shot five times from behind while in her vehicle - including one shot to the back of her head - at the dramatic culmination of the October 3 car chase.

Family attorney Eric Sanders said that the autopsy found that Carey was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs and challenged law enforcement accounts that she was delusional.

Sanders said that the 'Carey family 
is understandably upset' and said that officers who shot Carey 
mishandled the encounter and should be prosecuted.

Carey
 died after a car chase that began at the White House and finished near 
the US Capitol with her one-year-old daughter in the car.

The little girl survived the shooting of her mother, who had been diagnosed with postpartum depression and psychosis.

Prior
 to the shooting, Carney had displayed worrying signs of mental illness,
 telling officers on one occasion that President Barack Obama 
communicated with her and had set up cameras to record her life for 
national news outlets, police said.

Tragic and dramatic: Miriam Carey was shot dead by Secret Service and Capitol Hill police after a high speed chase in which she rammed a barrier to the White House and then sped off towards the US Capitol building

The autopsy was performed by the D.C. Medical Examiner and shows that Carey was shot once in the head, three times in the back, and once in the shoulder when she led the U.S. Capitol Police and Uniformed Secret Service on a pursuit last October.

The Carey family has filed a $75 million claim against the federal government for the actions they call disproportionate during the 10-minute chase that ended with Miriam Carey dead while her one-year-old daughter was sat in the back of the car.

The Capitol Police officers involved still remain on paid administrative leave.

Last year, Miriam Carey's sisters, Amy Carey-Jones and Valarie Carey, appeared on NBC's Today show to make it clear that their sister was not under the delusion that President Barack Obama was 'communicating' with her, as one of her ex-boyfriends has said.

Health issues: Attorney Eric Sanders said on his law firm's website that the autopsy found Miriam Carey was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Carey was shot to death after a car chase that went from the White House to near the U.S. Capitol in October of last year

'She was not walking around delusional. which is what we really want the public to understand,' sister Valarie, a retired New York Police Department officer, said.

The sisters questioned the police officers handling of their sister, since she was unarmed.

'I feel that things could have been handled a lot differently,' Amy said. 'We still fell that there was maybe another story than what we're being told.'

When asked by host Matt Lauer if they believe their sister was responsible for her death in any way, the sisters said no.

'What I do see is that perhaps maybe my sister was a little afraid being surrounded by officers with their guns drawn,' Valarie said. 'My sister was fleeing. She was trying to figure out how to get out of there.'

Witnesses to the tragic incident said Miriam plowed through a temporary barrier and hit a Secret Service agent who was trying to wave her off - sending him flying onto the hood of her car.

The Secret Service opened fire on her car as she turned and fled.

Police pursued her through the streets of Capitol Hill during a frantic chase that hit speeds up to 80pmh.

Officers were audibly heard to be shooting at the car as it drove away from the scene.

Moments later, Miriam was shot and killed - within sight of the Capitol Building, and just behind the U.S. Supreme Court. She was not armed.

Since the shooting, police have revealed that Miriam suffered from post-partum depression following the birth of her now-18-month-old daughter, whose name has not been released.

After searching Miriam's Stamford, Connecticut home, police found files confirming her former mental diagnosis, though the clearest reports come from an interview with her sisters.

Valarie Carey, left, and Amy Carey-Jones, right, defended their sister Miriam on NBC's Today Show this morning, saying she wasn't delusional when she tried to drive through a White House barrier on Thursday, which lead police to fatally shoot her

'My sister was not a bipolar schizophrenic individual. I can’t say as to why she was in DC,' said Valarie.

Amy described the medical issues as something that was carefully monitored by her doctors, who felt that she only needed to be on the medication for a year following the initial diagnosis given her lack of any prior issues.

'I just know that my sister did experience post-partum depression along with psychosis,' Amy said.

'She worked very closely with her doctor to taper her off the medication.

'It wasn’t something that was displayed- it was a momentary breakdown… She didn’t appear to be unstable.
