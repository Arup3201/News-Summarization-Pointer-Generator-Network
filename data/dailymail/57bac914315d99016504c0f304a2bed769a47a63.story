In nothing short of a miracle a man survived being run over by a pick-up truck and it was caught on surveillance footage.

Travis Roberts of Portland, Oregon  was doing construction work near a manhole this weekend when suddenly a truck hit a cone and ran right over him fracturing a rib and giving him a nasty road rash.

'Just amazed, I’m sitting here alive and not worse off, not paralyzed,' Roberts told KOIN yesterday.

Miracle: Travis Roberts says he is happy to be alive and says that drivers should pay attention to where they are gong and not drive as though they are in a rush all the time

'I get to come home and see my wife and kids.'

Travis Roberts did all he thought was possible to protect himself from danger. He set up bright orange cones and even parked his truck in the way of traffic.

'I had the truck backed up to me and then cones around me pout of radius,' said Roberts.

Despite his efforts, the truck driver didn't see him and he likely won’t get a ticket because the accident happened on private property, reports KTLA.

The driver had insurance and likely won’t get a ticket for reckless driving.

'Mostly I want people to be aware of their surroundings and be cautious about everything. There's not need to be in a giant rush,' said Roberts.

Slowing down and taking an extra look might just may save someone's life.
