Lionel Messi showed why he is the boss at Barcelona making the first two goals and scoring the third in a 3-1 win over Atletico Madrid at the Nou Camp.

After a week when the Argentine had taken on coach Luis Enrique, the board had sacked the Sporting Director and called early elections the Barcelona players closed ranks around their number 10 and closed the gap on Real Madrid at the top of the table to one point.

Messi clearly used his arm to make the second goal of the night for Luis Suarez and gave away a second half penalty as Atletico Madrid clawed their way back into the game but he made sure Barça rode out the visitors’ come back by scoring the decisive third.

Barcelona’s front three clicked as early as 12 minutes when Messi and Dani Alves exchanged passes down the right with the Argentine angling his run towards goal. 

His pass to Suarez cannoned off the Uruguayan and ran to Neymar who scrambled it past Miguel Moya. It wasn’t pretty but Luis Enrique will take anything at the moment and it lifted the pressure inside the Camp Nou – a Camp Nou with 70,000 more supporters inside it than for Barcelona’s midweek cup game.

That match on Thursday saw Barça demolish lowly Elche and everyone had expected this to be a much tougher test but the Atletico Madrid who were unbeaten against Barcelona in six games last season had simply not turned up.

There was none of the relentless pressing of the opposition and, with journeyman right back Jesus Gamez playing as a left-back up against Messi, Barcelona were threatening down that flank every time they attacked.

When the second goal came it came from Messi picking the ball up on the right – almost literally – he nudged it forward with his arm before racing clear and playing in Suarez who buried it for 2-0.

Simeone remonstrated with the referee Alberto Undiano, and Diego Godin and Mario Mandzukic made various gestures towards the match official suggesting he had seen the incident but not had the courage to stop play.

It had been a busy first half for the Undiano. Neymar was left with a bloodied foot after clashing with Jose Gimenez, Mandzukic elbowed Sergi Busquets and Messi caught Gamez with his forearm. Another referee might easily have shown a red card for one of the incidents.

The second half continued in the same spirit with Juanfran going through the back of Neymar and picking up a yellow card. Arda Turan should have followed him into the book for chopping down Andres Iniesta. 

The referee than had the biggest call of the game as Messi tried to pinch the ball from Gamez in the Barcelona penalty area. He made contact with the full-back who exaggerating the clash throwing himself up in the air and persuading Undiano to point to the spot. Mandzukic slammed home the penalty despite the 98,000 screams inside the stadium and Atletico were back in the game.

Suarez was booked at the other end after protesting when the referee waved away appeals for a foul on Rakitic from Jimenez as the pair jumped for a cross. Mandzukic had words with Suarez no doubt trying to provoke the Uruguayan further. Tiago then went into the book for pulling back Neymar.

With 20 minutes left Simeone threw Fernando Torres into the mix. The Atletico Madrid striker came into the game with a record of five goals in six appearances on this ground. His moment of glory so nearly came with 10 minutes left when Mandzukic’ cross left him racing to the loose ball but he was beaten to it by Claduio Bravo.

Messi made no mistake two minutes from time when he was given two chances to convert Rakitic’s cross and he sent it past Moya at the second attempt. The power he has off the pitch has been up for debate all week – the in fluence he has on the pitch has never been in doubt.
