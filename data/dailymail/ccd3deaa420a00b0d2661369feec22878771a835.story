A Beatles superfan has created a unique book of ordinary people's chance encounters with the world’s most famous band.

The Beatles and Me by Dean Johnson, which is being officially launched on Monday, is devoted to meetings between John, Paul, George and Ringo, and their adoring fans.

Compiled from more than 700 contributions, it contains stories and pictures from over five decades of Beatlemania.

Superfans: Liz and Jim Hughes who ran the Beatles Museum getting to meet their hero Paul McCartney

Iconic studios: Young fan Richard Porter met McCartney outside Abbey Road in 1982

The book came together after Johnson set up a Facebook page at Christmas to learn about other people’s memories of meeting The Beatles.

Johnson, from Wirral, Merseyside, said: 'Everyone here has a Beatles story, whether they have met them personally or they know someone who worked on one of their bathrooms.

'I thought it would be a laugh to set up the page and see if anyone had anything interesting to say.

'Posts came flooding in and the idea snowballed. The things people posted were fantastic and very interesting.

'Perhaps the most touching of the tales 
was a story of when somebody was stopped outside The Cavern Club a few 
months before George Harrison died.

'They said that some 'scruffy guy' asked: ‘Where is a good place to eat? It has all changed around here?’'

'It turned out it was George coming back home one last time and he took a local stranger for a drink to thank him for showing him around.'

After the Facebook page became so popular, Dean decided to turn the collection into a book for fans around the world to cherish forever. 

Johnson said: 'The reaction was unexpected but brilliant and the book has become a valuable source of Beatles history.

'There
have been hundreds of books published that give you a general history 
of the band - where they were born, how they grew to fame, but nothing 
personal about the real them and what they mean to their fans.

'It’s
the first book to gather their history from the fans’ point of view and
it’s the first book about them to be culled from Facebook.

Stories in the book include one from a Pat Jackson, which reads: 'A mate of mine was teaching a McCartney gig.

'The sound manager took everyone aside beforehand and said, ‘You are not allowed to look at Mr. McCartney.'

'You are not allowed to address Mr. McCartney directly. You can only talk to Mr McCartney if he addresses you first’.

'Later on, my mate was laying a cable on the ground. She tried to move one cable and it wouldn’t shift, so she looked up the cable to see what the problem was and saw a foot.

'’Hey, shift yer [sic] foot,' said she, and looked up to see McCartney lift his foot up quickly and go, ‘Oh, sorry ‘bout that!’'

'She realised she had mucked up talking to "the man", but he seemed genuinely apologetic, so she passed it off.

'Ten minutes later, the sound manager came up to her and said, '‘You’ve got ten minutes. Go down to your locker, get your stuff and get out'.'

'My mate was absolutely horrified 
but, not wanting to make a fuss, did what she was told and headed down 
to the lockers. She was just packing her stuff when he got a tap on the 
shoulder.

'’Er, sorry 
about that. It wasn’t your fault and we’ve sorted it. You can head back 
up to work if you want to’. It was McCartney.

'She went upstairs and continued to work. The sound manager got sacked.'

Another tale was by a girl who ran a fan club dedicated to George Harrison.

Seeing how much she liked him, he invited her over to England to meet him but when she turned up, he had forgotten their arrangement.

George walked out of the house with Eric Clapton and told her he couldn’t see her that day but asked her to come back the following year.

She did just that and he took her out for a meal with him.

Other contributions to the book include a letter sent from The Beatles to a Peter Brown, dated 16th June, 1969.

Within the letter, the band apologise to Mr Brown for being unable to 'fulfill their original promise of sending him a ticket to a Beatles TV show as a prize for winning the fan club competition.'

They go on to say, 'We are really very sorry about this, and have spent a long time thinking of an alternative which would not be a mere consolation for the original prize.

'Anyway, at last we’re able to tell you that your new prize - and we hope you like it - is to be an advance copy of the Beatles new album, which at the moment we’re expecting to release towards the end of August.

'John, Paul, George and Ringo would all like to congratulate you on winning, and hope you will accept their apologies for the delay.'

Also submitted to the Facebook site, which can be seen in the published book, are private photos taken by fans.

The book, which retails for £8.75, is being launched at The Music of Merseyside exhbition at The Liverpool Academy of Arts, on Monday.

Dean added: 'These stories are the other side of Beatlemania. We are peoplemania.

'It is important that we document the fans’ side of the Beatlemania phenomenon.'
