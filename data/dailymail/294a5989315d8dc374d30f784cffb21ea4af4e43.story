The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall chat happily as they give the corgis a bath while the Queen looks cheerful as she enjoys breakfast in bed.

But while these might look like unusually candid snaps of the Royal Family, in reality, they are a clever spoof created by artist Alison Jackson.

Inspired by next week's Mothering Sunday, Jackson has tried to imagine how you might treat your mother when she happens to be the Queen. 

Giving the corgis a bath: Charles and Camilla give the Queen's corgis a bath in a lurid pink bathroom

And according to Jackson, that means hosing down the corgis and carefully giving boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with bearskin and crown covers.

The next photo shows Charles and Camilla, who, as a mother herself will be expecting some treats of her own next Sunday, bathing the corgis in a vivid pink bathroom before drying them off with a patriotic Union Flag towel.

Amusingly, the royal couple are seen following the bath up with a blow dry, with Camilla grimacing as Prince Charles accidentally blows hot air in her face. 

Next comes the big reveal, with the Queen looking thrilled as she is presented with her breakfast tray, a card that reads 'Keep calm and reign on' and three pots of the Body Shop's Vitamin E moisture cream.

Finally, Her Majesty is seen sharing her toast soldiers and eggs with her freshly washed - and now very happy - corgis.

Jackson is no stranger to reinventing the Royal Family, having previously worked on 'photos' of all the senior royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

Others to feature in her work include Pippa Middleton, who was the subject of her Christmas pastiche, which depicted Miss Middleton desperately attempting to wrap up a corgi for the Queen.

More risqué depictions of the Royal Family include a photo of the Duchess of Cornwall on the treadmill clutching a gin and tonic and another of Camilla, this time smoking a cigarette.

Some for you too: The freshly washed corgis are then shown getting to share Her Majesty's meal

One particularly amusing set claims to go behind the scenes of Prince George's 2013 Christening, with one photo showing the Queen looking horrified as her great grandson is sick on her.

Others show a nude William and Kate in the bath with George and another in which the Duchess of Cambridge carefully changes her son's nappy.

The latest set of photos were created as part of a 'Treat your Mum like a Queen' campaign being run  by the Body Shop ahead of Mothering Sunday.
