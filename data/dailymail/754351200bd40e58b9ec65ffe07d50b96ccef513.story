The American woman and the Canadian man accused of plotting a bloody Valentines Day massacre in a Halifax shopping mall appeared in court on Friday under tight security.

Lindsay Kannitha Souvannarath, 23, of Illinois and Randall Steven Shepherd made a brief appearance in court on charges of conspiracy to commit murder ahead of a preliminary hearing in April.

The third alleged co-conspirator, James Gamble, 19, took his own life at home in Timberlea on February 13 ahead of the alleged planned shooting spree when police surrounded his house.

Tired: Lindsay Souvannarath and Randall Steven Shepherd are charged with conspiracy to commit murder, allegedly plotting a Valentine's Day mass shooting at the Halifax Shopping Centre

Police in Canada say the three planned to go on a shooting rampage at Halifax Shopping Center in Nova Scotia - before committing suicide.

Souvannarath and Shepherd were also charged with conspiracy to commit arson, possession of weapons for a dangerous purpose and uttering threats via social media.

They were both arrested at Halifax Stanfield International Airport after Souvannarath disembarked her flight from Chicago.

Both defendants were stony faced and passive during their court appearance and neither spoke.

Judge Brian Gibson told the court to reconvene on April 10 and heard that the pair have not applied for bail.

Last month, tutors who taught Columbine-obsessed goth, Souvannarath, said she was a disturbed but talented writer.

Souvannarath, 23, from Geneva, Illinois was arrested alongside Randall Steven Shepherd, 20, from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and charged with conspiracy to commit murder.

College Professor Charles Aukema said: 'She knew how to put together a sentence and she had a command of detail. Sometimes, it was pretty sick detail.'

According to the Chicago Tribune, Prof Aukema had Souvannarath as a student in 2012.

Commenting on her writing style, Prof Aukema said: 'It's like a method actor trying to get into the mindset of a killer and then becomes a serial killer. I thought she was quite an introvert. It just seemed like she had no friends whatsoever.'

Souvannarath admitted the massacre plot after her arrest at Halifax airport.

A third suspect is believed to have shot himself after police surrounded his home in the Halifax suburb of Timberlea.

It is understood that Souvannarath, Shepherd, and the third man, James Gamble had discussed their plans on the internet.

Canadian media said that Gamble, 19, took his own life.

Justice Minister Peter MacKay said: 'Based on what we know so far, it would have been devestating. Mass casualties would have been a real possibility.

'This appeared to be a group of murderous misfits that were coming here, or living here, and were planning to wreak havoc and mayhem in our community.'

Brian Brennan of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said three long-barrelled rifles had been recovered from Gamble's house.

Souvannarath's writing is understood to be very disturbing and features stories about serial killers

Souvannarath posted about her admiration of Hitler, the Columbine killers and other murderers on her Facebook page, Tumblr site and forums, and even hinted at the deadly plan, writing last Wednesday: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down.'

Two days after the post, she was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder after police received a tip. Randall Shepherd, 20, of Nova Scotia was arrested on the same charges.

A third suspect, James Gamble, 19 killed himself as police moved to arrest him at his home in Nova Scotia, and a fourth - a 17-year-old boy - has been released from custody.

Online profiles show the named suspects had been exchanging unnerving messages for years.

The dark messages come in stark contrast to Souvannarath's high school yearbook photo shared by the Kane County Chronicle, which shows a pretty teen. She went on to study at Coe College, where she studied English and creative writing before graduating last year.

But online, Souvannarath, whose father is from Laos, painted herself as a neo-Nazi and regularly shared photos of Hitler while lauding white separatists, such as former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

'Free speech is dead,' she apparently wrote in one forum in 2007, when she would have been just 15. 'That's why we need people like David Duke to bring it to life again.'

Her Tumblr account is entitled 'c**kswastika', according to the Chronicle Herald.

On the page, she displays a large pink swastika and links to James Gamble's Tumblr page, which shows images of Hitler, dead bodies and murders, and videos of the Columbine shooters.

Gamble's page also features conversations that include graphic sexual descriptions as well as naked images of himself.

'I'm such a morbid f***ing freak,' he writes in one post. 'I love it.'

Her Tumblr page also features images of the Columbine shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, including photos of their dead bodies,

'Eric and Dylan are dead, but Reb and VoDKa live,' she wrote, apparently referring to Gamble.

In one post from February 11, she shared a movie poster showing two ghoulish figures with the words: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down' - perhaps hinting at their alleged plan for February 14.

Beneath the poster she added: 'It's almost here. The clock is ticking.'

She also shared quotes from murderers and photos of weapons. One picture shows a man holding a gun and wearing a t-shirt that reads: 'Natural selection.'

Another post on her blog reads 'Saturday the 14th' in red, dripping letters with the comment: 'Ha Haa' written beneath.

Her website is still showing new updates. Police said that she had pre-programmed online messages before she was due to carry out the attacks and ultimately kill herself.
