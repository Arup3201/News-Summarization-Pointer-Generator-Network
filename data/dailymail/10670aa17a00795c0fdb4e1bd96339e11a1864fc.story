A double self-immolation protest in China has left one Tibetan man dead and another seriously injured.

Former monk Tenzin Khedup, 24, and Ngawang Norphel, 22, held out Tibetan flags and shouted pro-independence songs as the flames engulfed them on the street in Dzatoe township in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai province.

Passersby watched in horror as Khedup burned to death in front of them, while Norphel was taken to hospital with serious burns, Radio Free Asia reported.

Protest: One of the Tibetan men tries to run as the flames engulf him while another falls to the floor in agony, during their self-immolation protest on the street in Yushu prefecture in China's Qinghai province

Horrific: The men hold out Tibetan flags as the flames get higher during their protest against China's rule in Tibetan-populated areas

The pair's protest takes the total 
number of self-immolations to 41 since troubles began in 2009. The men 
had been calling for an end to Chinese rule in Tibetan-populated areas 
and the return of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.

Lobsang Sangay, a monk in India, 
originally from the Zekar monastery in Yusu, told Radio Free Asia the 
pair had left a suicide note.

It read: 'We
 could not contribute significantly towards the Tibetan religion and 
culture and we could not (help bring) economic benefits to 
Tibetans.

Fighting for their beliefs: The two men were also calling for the return of Tibet's exiled leader the Dalai Lama

Death: Official Xinhua News Agency said one of the men died while the other was seriously injured in hospital

Spreading the word: The Dalai Lama, seen sharing a joke with Prince Charles, is currently on a 10-day tour of Britain and yesterday called plans to resume talks with China over Tibet futile

'Therefore,
 we have decided to self-immolate with the hope that His Holiness the 
Dalai Lama may live long and return to Tibet as soon as possible. For 
the cause of Tibetans, we chose to die for these reasons.'

They added: 'We
 also want to appeal to our fellow youth that they should not quarrel 
among themselves and they should not have any ill feelings against each 
other. Everyone should unite to uphold the cause of the Tibetan race and
 nationality.'

The Dalai Lama, currently on a 10-day
 tour of Britain, said yesterday that resuming talks with China on his 
homeland's future was hopeless unless it adopted a 'realistic' stance, adding it was useless trying to convince Beijing he was not seeking full independence.

In comments likely to enrage a Chinese
 leadership already angry over his trip to Britain, the spiritual leader
 also said a shift towards democracy and better human rights in China 
was inevitable and the Chinese people 'really want change'.
