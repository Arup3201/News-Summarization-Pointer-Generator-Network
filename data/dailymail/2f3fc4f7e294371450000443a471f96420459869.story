Maoist sect leader Aravindan Balakrishnan investigated over allegations of slavery has been charged with 25 counts of offences including rape

A Maoist sect leader investigated arrested over allegations of slavery a year ago has been charged with 25 counts of offences including rape, police said.

Aravindan Balakrishnan, 74, is also accused of crimes including false imprisonment, indecent assault and cruelty to a child under 16. 

Balakrishnan, who was arrested in Lambeth, south London, in November last year, faces one count of cruelty to a person under the age of 16, one count of false imprisonment, 19 counts of indecent assault and four counts of rape. 

He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on December 17.  

The offences relate to three women - 30-year-old Briton, a 57-year-old Irishwoman and a 69-year-old Malaysian -  and span a period between January 1980 and October 2013.

Balakrishnan, known as 'Comrade Bala,' led an obscure Maoist collective in the late 1970s. He was arrested in November along with his wife, who was later released without charge.

Police said the suspect shared a political ideology with three other inhabitants, who were allegedly held in a London house for decades.

Anthony Connell, senior prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'The CPS has today authorised the police to charge Aravindan Balakrishnan with a number of charges including false imprisonment, cruelty to a person under 16 years, indecent assault and rape.

'After careful consideration we have decided that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.'  

In November his wife, Chanda Pattni, 67, was told she would not be prosecuted over the allegations after nearly a year on bail.

The case made headlines when Balakrishnan and Ms Pattni were arrested in November last year, after one of the women rang a charity claiming she had been held against her will, sparking a police inquiry.

Police said three women, then aged 69, 57 and 30, had been living in the house as part of a political 'collective'. 

Described as a 'guru', Balakrishnan set up a communist squat, the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre, in Brixton in 1976 where the couple ran their group, the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse Tung Thought, holding lectures and film evenings. 

He had been kicked out of the Communist Party's national executive after his faction 'attempted to put themselves above the discipline of the party'. 

Officers from the Metropolitan Police's human trafficking unit said at the time that the case was 'completely unique' in their experience.

After raiding the house, police removed 55 bags of evidence and 12,500 exhibits, but admitted the 'complexity' of the case meant it would take a long time to investigate.
