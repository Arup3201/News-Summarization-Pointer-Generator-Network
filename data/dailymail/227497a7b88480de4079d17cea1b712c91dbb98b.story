A mother has spoken of her shock after a 4ft-long boa constrictor appeared in her bathroom whilst she was bathing her two daughters.

Stacey Way, 28, said she had previously spotted a yellow object next to a water pipe a few days before, but, thinking it was a banana her toddler had shoved down the side, had forgotten all about it.

Or at least she had, until, a few days later when she suddenly saw the object move - and realised it was a snake.

Stacey Way, 28, said she was shocked to discover the 4ft boa constrictor in her bathroom whilst she was in there with her two children

The 28-year-old mother, from Parkstone, Dorset, said: 'I was so shocked, I couldn’t believe it.

'I was wiping the bathroom floor when I noticed what I thought was a mouldy banana my toddler had shoved down the side of the water pipe.

'I know it sounds ridiculous, but I thought ‘I’ll get that in a minute with my gloves on and then just forget all about it.

'Three days later I was bathing my two little ones and wiped around the floor again when I saw that this thing was sticking out more than before, but as I got closer it went back in.

The 28-year-old mother said she had spotted what she thought was a banana in her bathroom several days before, but the fruit turned out instead to be a huge snake

'I looked closer and realised that the banana, or now snake, had a mouth.'

Horrified, she took the children, aged two and four out of the bath, and called a friend who arrived with a box.

The pair went to a nearby reptile centre to ask for help but they were forced to call the RSPCA, who told them the floorboards would need to be removed to rescue the beast.

But as the property was rented, the officer advised her to leave a tub full of water on the bathroom floor to entice the snake out.

When Stacey checked a few hours later the creature had fully emerged and the reptile centre were able to collect it from her home in Parkstone, Dorset.

Stacey Way, 28, points to the spot in her bathroom, right, where the huge boa constrictor, left, was hiding away

'When I looked in the bathroom a few hours later he was sticking right out the hole so I called the shop and they came and got him,' she said.

'It was about three-to-four feet long, I couldn’t believe it.

'Now I think I’m seeing snakes everywhere even though we’ve filled up all the holes.

'I don’t mind snakes from a distance, but not in my bathroom.'

And staff from the reptile centre who are now looking after the snake known to grow up to 13ft long say they are baffled as to where the snake could have come from.

Leanne Harris, owner of Safe Haven Exotics said: 'The snake could have come from anywhere, it could have escaped from a cage or have been dumped by someone.

'I was shocked when I found out it was in Stacey’s bathroom.'
