Suicide prevention charity Samaritans has launched a new Twitter app that enables users to monitor the accounts of their friends for distressing messages

A new app aims to help suicidal people by alerting their friends when they post messages online which might suggest that they are considering killing themselves. 

The programme, dubbed 'Samaritans Radar', was created by suicide prevention charity the Samaritans, and must be downloaded by individual users who are then able to monitor people they follow on Twitter for potential warning signs. 

This is done by Samaritans' specially created algorithm that identifies words and phrases that could suggest depression or suicidal thoughts - such as 'help me', 'hate myself' or 'tired of being alone'.

Joe Ferns of Samaritans said: 'Social media has changed how we talk to each other. It has created a dis-inhibition effect that means people are being more honest online.

'We know that people struggling to cope often go online looking for support, however, there is still so much we need to learn about why this happens and how we can make the online environment safer for vulnerable people.'

Mr Ferns said that this new tool would help because rather than placing them directly in front of an organisation, friends can step in to offer help first.

'By not addressing this issue we run the risk of shutting these discussions down and driving them underground.

'Instead we need to use tools such as Samaritans Radar to encourage people to look out for one another online, helping them to reach out and offer support. People will go to friends first.

'This app and the guidance provided enables them to help.'

After activation, users will receive an alert via email when a potentially worrying tweet is spotted. Once a user has logged in, they will be able to see the tweet and confirm whether or not it is a potential worry. 

If a user confirms that a tweet is worrying, information and guidance on how to approach the poster and talk to them is sent out.

The advice will include tips on how to introduce the idea of contacting Samaritans, but the charity suggested that they would not get involved unless requested to do so by those involved.

Mr Ferns said that Samaritans were hoping to work with other social networks such as Facebook as well, but claimed that Twitter is easier to monitor because it is 'more open'.

Simon McAvoy, from digital agency Jam, who created the app, said: 'Social media gets a lot of bad press, but we believe there is good to be done.'

Patricia Cartes, Twitter's global head of trust and safety outreach, said that the younger generation were the key audience for the new app.

'While the app is aimed at anyone using Twitter, the key audience for Samaritans Radar is the "Millennials" group - otherwise known as Generation Y - which typically includes 18 to 35-year-olds. 

'They are "digital natives" - growing up using new technology and the first generation to grow up with computers in their home.' 

Professor Jonathan Scourfield, from the school of social sciences at Cardiff University, explained that a pattern had been found between suicidal language being posted online, adding that the number of suicides highlighted the need to monitor places such as Twitter more.

'Through social media there has been a normalisation of suicidal language through repeated use online,' he said.

'Twitter is important because past studies have found that a correlation between suicidal statements posted online and resulting suicides exists.'  

Anyone with a Twitter account can activate Samaritans Radar by visiting the website and signing into Twitter and providing an email address for alerts to be sent to.
