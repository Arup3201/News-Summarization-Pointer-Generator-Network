A football club captain died aged 27 after he suffered a fatal stroke triggered by heading the ball too often.   

'Talented' striker Bryan Herbert was a hero among his teammates for his prolific scoresheet and 'man of the match awards'.

But he collapsed just hours after setting up a match-winning goal for his team - Bacup Borough Football Club in Bacup, Lancashire - and died in hospital eight weeks later.

An inquest was told a blood clot on his brain had been caused by footballs regularly clashing with his skull as he went in for headers, which in turn caused the fatal stroke.

Keen footballer Bryan Herbert (left with Stackesteads St Josephs assistant manager Darren Green) had no idea that he was suffering from a life-threatening blood-clot

The coroner heard the chef had complained to his girlfriend of a headache in August last year and he collapsed shortly afterwards.

The centre forward player was rushed to hospital but died in October with his girlfriend Vicky Bruty and the rest of his family at his bedside.

The fatal seizure happened as the couple were about to to jet off on a summer holiday to together to Zante in Greece.

After his death the club published a match programme dedicated to Bryan with his picture on the front page and numerous tributes inside.

After a coroner recorded a verdict of natural causes, teaching assistant Vicky, 25, said: 'Bryan lived for his football and now it looks like he died for his football.

'Obviously Brian's death has turned my life upside down. After the holiday we were planning on starting our life together and starting a family.

The football caption (pictured with girlfriend Vicky Bruty) began to feel unwell in August last year, before losing the power of speech and screaming in agony

The footballer for Bacup Borough Football Club, who was regularly awarded man of the match, was adored by teammates and supporters

'He did used to complain to me of headaches but someone else can never know as to what degree of pain they were - and he was a typical lad and didn't go to the doctors.

'On the day before we were due to go out on holiday he seemed fine and was talking of how much we were looking forward to it. But the following morning he woke complaining a headache and was joking that he hoped it would not ruin the holiday.

'He said "I hope I don't feel like this on the plane".

'But at about 8am he said he was feeling a lot worse and said he couldn't move.

'He was screaming out in pain then he stopped being able to talk so we called an ambulance. Then it was just a whirlwind and he had the stroke.

'Even though he hadn't been able to talk again, he started laughing and was able to move part of his arms and was aware of what was going on around him. We thought he was going to get better.

'I went with him in the ambulance and then his speech went in the ambulance and he never spoke again.

'It was heartbreaking watching him go like that and I couldn't take it in. I was with him every day.

The chef suffered a blood clot in a vital artery which had prevented blood flow to the brain

'We now have to take each day as it comes and it makes you realise how precious life is. It came as such a shock.'

Bryan, a lifelong Liverpool fan, played for Bacup Junior's side at 12 before progressing to the seniors at 16.

He also played for another amateur squad Stacksteads St Josephs and was captain for a local pub team.

He regularly featured in local newspaper sports reports about his goal scoring feats and often notched up to five goals in a single game and helped win several trophies.

After hit a winning trail in the Burnley and District Boys League one local newspaper report began: 'There's only one Bryan Herbert.'

While he was in hospital, the skipper's teammates hung banners urging him to get better - but he died with his grirfriend and the rest of his family at his bedside

Bryan's mother Alicia Herbert told the inquest that her son had suffered from headaches previously - and six weeks prior to the stroke had come home from football 'feeling sickly'.

An ambulance was called but she told the inquest that the headache had passed and he was feeling better. Tragedy struck last August after he was appointed skipper at Stacksteads.

He suffered a blood clot in a vital artery which had prevented blood flow to the brain.

His team mates hung banners in the ward by team-mates saying: 'We need our skipper back', but he died in October at the Blackburn Royal Hospital.

The Blackburn hearing was told there 
was no missed opportunity to help Bryan and nothing could have been done
 differently in his treatment.

Mrs Herbert told the inquest: 'We got eight weeks with him, it was a shock and we were told we needed to pray for a miracle.'

Bryan, who began playing football for Bacup Borough Juniors when he was 12, played centre forward three or four times a week

After examination of the brain, a neuropathologist concluded that there had been a blood clot in the brain that could have been caused by high blood pressure - or trauma such as whiplash or a sudden jerk causing the vessel to break.

The pathologist said: 'Getting a clot at that young age is not a common phenomenon.'

After the inquest Bryan's father Gary said: 'You don't expect to outlive your child.

'He was a talented footballer and played centre forward, playing three or four times a week. His team will be holding tribute matches to him each year in his memory.'

Bacup manager Brent Peters said: 'I am shocked and deeply upset by the death of Bryan. He loved his football, he was quick with a good eye for goal.

'Bryan was fully committed be it a training game or a fully fledged official game. His commitment, his enthusiasm, his determination could never be questioned.

'Bryan Herbert's legacy will always remain with me and Bacup Borough Football Club. There is a big void left that will never be filled.

'Bryan Herbert will be a sad loss to not only his close family but his football family.'

Coroner Michael Singelton said: 'It is unbelievable that somebody who was so fit and healthy and an active sportsman that something could happen that is so catastrophic.

'It is almost unbelievable and one of the things that my job tells me is that you can take nothing for granted in life. You don't know what is around the corner and everyday is precious.

'As a parent myself I can't begin to imagine the trauma you and the family have had, seeing Bryan this very fit, active young man reduced to this, in circumstances where doctors are unable to do anything.'

The blood clot in Bryan's 
brain could have been caused by high blood pressure - or trauma 
such as whiplash or a sudden jerk causing a blood vessel to break.

One theory is that every time the ball hits the head, the blood vessel 
walls become less stiff and weakens so they expand, like a garden hose that 
becomes fatter as it ages. 

Research published this week suggests that repeated, sub-concussive hits
 to the head are dangerous and are also linked to neurological disorders 
such as multiple sclerosis later in life.

Scientists from the University of Rochester Medical Center say that the 
brain degeneration observed among professional football players may be due 
to something in their immune system spiralling out of control.

This could be because it damages the blood-brain barrier - a 'gate' between the brain and bloodstream. When the barrier 
is working properly, it holds in proteins and molecules that bathe the 
brain and protect it from foreign substances.

With blows to the head, however, the barrier opens slightly and allows 
some proteins to leak into the bloodstream and possibly attack the 
brain. 

And just last week, researchers at the University of Texas warned that heading a football could cause brain damage.

They said that a header is classed as a 'minor sub-concussive blow' and 
have found that young people who play football are less able to perform 
tasks requiring basic thinking skills than those who avoid the game.
