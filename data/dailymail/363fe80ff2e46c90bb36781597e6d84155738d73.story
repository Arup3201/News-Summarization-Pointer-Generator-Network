As David Coleman takes his seat in the celestial commentary-box, alongside John Arlott, Ron Pickering, Peter Jones, Reg Gutteridge and so many other wonderful broadcasters who became as synonymous with the sports on which they commentated as any actual participant, it is impossible not to reflect on the jabbering inanities that pass for so much television sports coverage today.

Coleman was the absolute antithesis of all the modern-day female sports reporters manifestly chosen for their looks rather than their depth of knowledge.

He must have wondered what had happened to the legacy handed down by him and those other great pioneers of television sport when he watched those touchline dollies who sometimes graduate to presenting jobs, but might as well be fronting programmes about gardening or property make-overs for all the sporting passion they exude.

He was the antithesis, too, of all the ex-footballers who appear to think that playing the game to a high level entitles them to pass off rank platitudes as keen insight.

It must be said that there are some shining exceptions, among them Gary Neville, Graeme Souness and Martin Keown. But from too many of the others, we get banter when we crave analysis, words when we crave silence.

Coleman, who died on Saturday aged 87, would never have tolerated that. His priority was his audience, and it showed.

Yet he was also respected, even venerated, both by his colleagues and those whose deeds he described.

The former athlete-turned commentator Steve Cram has admitted, with obvious sincerity, that when Coleman praised him for running well, it meant more to him than anything even his own coach might say. And many broadcasters who are now veterans themselves ascribe their success to watching the way Coleman did it.

All those who were lucky enough to work alongside him remember his volcanic eruptions of temper when his own high standards were not met.

He suffered fools notoriously badly, and there is a great YouTube clip of him ferociously haranguing a BBC cameraman who fluffed an opening link.

He had spent his National Service as an army PE instructor, and one can only imagine what he said to those who shirked their squat thrusts.

But he was hugely generous to those he admired, or in whom he saw promise, dispensing advice intended to propel them up the career ladder.

The former BBC athletics commentator Stuart Storey once told me what Coleman said to him, very succinctly and very firmly, at the beginning of his broadcasting career: 'This is television. The commentator should only say what the picture does not say.'

As a guiding principle, that should be branded in the mind, if not on the forehead, of every TV sports commentator.

Instead, it is treated these days as just another dusty, irrelevant maxim, like Lord Reith's original remit for the BBC to 'inform, educate and entertain'.

Sports commentator David Coleman's priority was his audience, and it showed

Listening to one of Coleman's football commentaries now is indeed a kind of re-education. No banalities, no wasted words, and yet all the more potent for it. 'Porterfield ... one-nil,' was how he greeted one of the most dramatic of all FA Cup final goals, for under-dog Sunderland against the then mighty Leeds United in 1973.

It was all that was required. He didn't go on to tell us that Ian Porterfield shared a birthday with King Farouk of Egypt, or whatever inconsequential fact might be trotted out today, because we didn't need to know.

Storey also told me: 'I also used to listen to the way in which he used intonation. In his athletics commentaries you could tell the difference between a heat, a semi-final and a final just by the way he used his voice.

'Before a final he would be silent, and then he would simply say: "The Olympic men's 100 metres final" and the hairs would stand up on the back of your neck.'

But such economy of style didn't mean a lack of preparation.

On the contrary, nobody prepared more thoroughly than Coleman, as I once heard from another of his proteges, the football commentator John Motson.

'He told me to immerse myself in the game I was covering and I'm still following that advice today,' said Motson. 'That's the way he brought me up.'

What Coleman brought both to the commentary-box and the presenter's chair were iron-clad journalistic virtues.

Born in 1926 in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, he had been a reporter on the Stockport Express and briefly edited another newspaper before joining the BBC in 1954, so he knew how to tell a story concisely.

That background in news was never more evident than in 1972, when he reported live and unscripted, with utterly unruffled and eloquent solemnity, from the Olympic Village in Munich, where 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage and then murdered by Black September terrorists.

He would eventually cover 16 summer and winter Olympic Games and six World Cups, as well as presenting Grandstand and Sportsnight With Coleman for many years, but that broadcast from Munich was his finest hour.

It proved the value of giving presenting jobs in television sport to trained journalists, another tradition that has evaporated in recent years, as our broadcasting companies fall over each other in the rush to hire former sportsmen and women, giving precious little thought, it sometimes seems, to whether they actually have the right qualities.

True, Gary Lineker and Sue Barker were bright and diligent enough to acquire them, but it's still worth wondering whether a David Coleman or a Desmond Lynam would reach the front of the career race today.

They would have to wrestle past an awfully crowded field of ex-players to get there. And if they didn't get there, think what we would lose. What, in fact, we might already have lost.

Crucially, Coleman did have some sporting pedigree of his own. As a fine middle-distance runner he had been an Olympic hopeful in 1952 until injury denied him the chance of a trial, so he understood athletics from both sides of the track.

An understanding and love of sport informed every one of his broadcasts, from that tour de force in Munich in 1972 to hundreds of episodes as quizmaster on A Question Of Sport from 1979 to 1997.

But it was underpinned by a newsman's instincts, and of course it is ironic — and not a little unfair — that a man who put in so many hours of homework should have given his name to the on-air gaffe, thanks to the Private Eye column Colemanballs.

Frankly, when you're performing live under the kind of pressure Coleman faced every day of his TV career, the occasional fluff is inevitable.

Another irony is that such a consummate professional should have inspired one of the most bumbling comic creations of recent times, in the hapless form of the Steve Coogan character Alan Partridge.

Long before he wound up on North Norfolk Digital, Partridge was a BBC sports reporter, whose mannerisms (and diamond-patterned pullovers) were plainly influenced by Coleman.

And before that, Coleman was lampooned in latex by the satirical show Spitting Image, excitably crying 'quite remarkable!'

Well, 'quite remarkable' is as good an epitaph as any for David Coleman. He was a true giant of broadcasting, and his passing offers a reminder that television sport now is populated by far too many who really don't deserve a place in his long shadow.
