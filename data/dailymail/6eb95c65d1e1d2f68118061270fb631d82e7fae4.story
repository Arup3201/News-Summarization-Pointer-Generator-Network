West Brom have rejected a third bid from Burnley for English defender Craig Dawson.

Burnley have offered Â£2m plus add-ons for the 24-year-old however they are yet to meet West Brom's estimation of the centre-back.

Other Premier League clubs have also shown interest although Dawson is keen to link up with Sean Dyche.

On the move? Burnley are desperately trying to entice West Brom into selling the English defender

Albion have an injury to summer signing Joleon Lescott which may delay any potential deal involving Dawson.

Lescott was forced off with a calf injury during West Brom's pre-season friendly defeat against Nottingham Forest on Saturday.

The Baggies are said to be prepared to cash in on Dawson as manager Alan Irvine has already bolstered his defensive options by bringing in Andre Wisdom and Cristian Gamboa as well as the aforementioned Lescott.
