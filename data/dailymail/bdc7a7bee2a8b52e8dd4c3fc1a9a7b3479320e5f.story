Schools catering for the children of British and other foreign workers in the Libyan city of Benghazi are among the potential targets of terrorists and kidnap gangs, European officials have warned.

All Britons are being urged by the Foreign Office to leave the city after it became aware of the 'specific and imminent threat', just days after the deadly hostage crisis in the neighbouring country of Algeria.

European officials, who did not want 
to be named, said that schools, businesses and 
offices of non-governmental organisations were among the potential 
targets.

Germany, Canada and Netherlands citizens 
have also been warned by their governments to immediately leave the 
eastern Libyan city.

The British government has been 
advising against all but essential travel to most of the country since 
last September, but stepped up its warning yesterday.

A spokesman said: 'We are now aware of
a specific and imminent threat to westerners in Benghazi, and urge any 
British nationals who remain there against our advice to leave 
immediately.

'We have updated our travel advice to 
reflect this. The British Embassy in Tripoli has been in contact with 
British nationals for whom we have contact details to alert them to the 
advice.

'We cannot comment further on the nature of the threat at this time.'

Adel Mansouri, principal of the 
International School of Benghazi who has both British and Libyan 
citizenship, said UK and foreign citizens were warned in the last few 
days about a possible threat to Westerners.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified toÂ  lawmakers about the handling of the deadly September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed

He added that the school's teachers were given the option of leaving but decided to stay.

The school has some 540 students, most
of which are Libyan with 40 holding dual nationality and less than five
per cent are British.

He said: 'We told the British ambassador we are staying, and we'll be in touch. We don't see a threat on the ground.'

The British School in Benghazi closed on Wednesday and may be closed for the next few weeks.

Hundreds of British businessmen, 
government officials, oil workers, aid workers, lawyers, investors and 
security officials have been travelling to Benghazi as the rebuilding of
post-Gaddafi Libya takes place.

Ironically, the city was the focus of 
the massive help given by Britain and other countries to Libyan forces 
seeking to topple the long time North African leader.

Since
then, Libya has been awash with weapons, and its shaky nascent 
institutions have struggled to rein in armed groups keen on ensuring 
they receive what they see as their fair share of power for helping to 
oust Gaddafi.

Benghazi in particular has been the 
scene of power struggles between various armed Islamist factions with 
international terrorists aligned to Al Qaeda said to be training in the 
surrounding desert sands and towns.

The dangers in the wake of Muammar 
Gaddafi's overthrow are said to include 'indiscriminate' terrorist 
attacks against foreign travellers and kidnapping.

The French military action in Mali, 
which has received British logistical support, has also raised the 
threat of retaliatory strikes on westerners.

Benghazi was the stronghold of the Western-backed revolt that eventually ended Gaddafi's hold on power in Libya.

However, Britain has not had any 
diplomatic presence in the city since an attack on the US mission last 
September that killed American ambassador Chris Stevens and three of his
colleagues.

Libyan officials have reportedly condemned the move as 'not rational' and have demanded an explanation from the Foreign Office.

According to the BBC, a Libyan 
official said: 'We are very surprised. It's not rational at all. We want
an explanation from the Foreign Office.'

Terrorists linked to the Blood Battalion of one-eyed jihadist and 
cigarette smuggler Mokhtar Belmokhtar kidnapped dozens of Western gas 
workers at the BP plant in Algeria - 37 died, including six Britons, 
after a shoot out with Algerian Special Forces - having crossed from 
Libya to carry out the attack.

Five of Belmokhtar's fighters were 
captured and are being interrogated in Algeria, who said to be passing 
on 'selective intelligence' to European allies.

In
a possible sign of impending trouble, the border crossing to Egypt was 
closed to all but Egyptians two days ago in an apparent attempt to keep 
westerners out of eastern Libya.

US drones have been deployed amid speculation about a possible attack by jihadists or an attack on them.

Officials said 
that following the recent French military intervention in Mali and the 
Algerian hostage crisis, there was the increased possibility of 
retaliatory attacks against Western interests.

David Cameron's national security 
adviser, Kim Darroch, was in the capital, Tripoli, on Wednesday for 
talks with the prime minister, Ali Zidan, on security collaboration.

The warning came a day after 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified to U.S. lawmakers 
about the handling of the deadly September 11 attack on the American 
mission in Benghazi which killed Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to 
Libya, and three other Americans.

The ambassador died of smoke 
inhalation when he was trapped inside as the building burned, after 
armed men had stormed the compound. 

The U.S. mission was attacked in September 2012, leading to three other American deaths

Members of the Ansar al-Sharia Islamic militant group were chased out of Benghazi by protestors following that attack.

Mrs Clinton told the congressional 
hearing on Wednesday that the Libyans had the 'willingness but not [the]
capacity' to provide security for diplomats in Benghazi In addition to 
the attack on the U.S. consulate, an Italian diplomat's car was fired on
by militants.

Foreign Office minister David Lidington 
said the government had received 'credible, serious and specific' 
reports about a possible terrorist threat.

He added: 'The terrorist 
risk in Benghazi and other parts of this region has been there for some 
time before Mali and the Algeria crisis of last weekend... the safety of
British citizens is our top priority.' Mr Lidington did not say whether
the British government would charter flights to Benghazi to evacuate 
British nationals.

While only 'tens' of nationals are registered with
the British Embassy as being in the city, it is a major exit point for 
commercial flights carrying Britons.

Prof
George Joffe, an expert in North African affairs at Cambridge 
University, said: 'What we are seeing is a sympathetic response to what
occurred in Algeria and Mali, and therefore a threat to Westerners.'
