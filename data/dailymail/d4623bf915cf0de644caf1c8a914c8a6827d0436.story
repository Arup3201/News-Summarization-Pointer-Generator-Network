The 41st Ryder Cup at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota will be held from September 30 to October 2, 2016, the PGA of America announced on Thursday.

It will be the second time in six years the biennial event will finish in October, following on from Celtic Manor in 2010. Bad weather in Wales forced a Monday finish for the first time in the contest's history.

The Ryder Cup is part of a crowded summer schedule in 2016, with just one week between the Open and US PGA due to golf's return to the Olympic Games for the first time since 1904.

The opening ceremony of the Olympics in Rio takes place on August 5, with the golf competitions (72-hole strokeplay events for men and women) provisionally scheduled to be held from August 6-9 and 12-15.
