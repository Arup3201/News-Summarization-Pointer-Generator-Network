Four footballers were today cleared today of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old girl who claimed she was attacked in a hotel room.

Brighton and Hove Albion players Anton Rodgers, 20, Lewis Dunk, 21, and George Barker, 21, and former team-mate Steve Cook, 22, who now plays for Bournemouth, had maintained their innocence.

Jurors at the Old Bailey also found them not guilty of voyeurism at a retrial.

They men were given bail throughout the 
trial and their families, including Rodgers’ father - Liverpool manager 
Brendan Rodgers - watched the proceedings.

The prosecution said the players were celebrating a victory in a local cup in July 2011 when they came across the woman, who was drunk, at a club.

She woke up at the Jury’s Inn hotel to find her strapless dress pulled down and said she saw explicit pictures on Rodgers’ mobile phone.

Richard Barton, prosecuting, said these were taken as a 'permanent record of their conquest'.

But despite forensic tests on all the players’ phones, only one photograph was found on Barker’s phone.

It showed the sleeping woman with 
shaving foam spelling out GB on her thigh. Barker was next to her doing a
thumbs-up sign and smiling.

Another player, Leon Redwood, said he went into the room at night and sprayed the foam.

Barker and Rodgers said the woman had joined in the 'boy’s banter'. She climbed into bed with them and started kissing them.

Dunk and Cook said they were sleeping on the floor and did not get involved with the woman.

The woman was said to have 'told a pack of lies' following the incident.

She agreed she lied to police and her employers but said she had been humiliated by the sportsmen.

She complained to police about the players six months later after getting into a volatile relationship with another player.

He wound her up about her photographs being shown around the club and kidded her that a video would be put on YouTube.

Police have been unable to find anyone at the club who had seen pictures of the woman.

The woman admitted an assortment of lies, including:

The woman hoped she would be taken out by Redwood on July 16, but started kissing and dancing with another player, Roland Bergkamp, after seeing him with another girl.

She said she was not drunk and could remember nothing after taking a drink in the club.

But her friend said they had each drunk between 10 and 15 shots of alcohol and shared a bottle of wine.

Jurors at an earlier trial in February could not agree verdicts but found Dunk not guilty of voyeurism.

Ordeal: George Barker (seen at a court appearance earlier this month), 21, and the other three footballers had maintained their innocence

Brighton this week released Rodgers and his team-mate Ben Sampayo, who was a reluctant prosecution witness in the case.

There were tears in the public gallery from the mothers and girlfriends of the footballers as the seven men and five women returned their verdicts.

The young sportsmen were released from the dock and wept in a group hug outside.

Visibly shaken, they were comforted by their families.

Dunk said outside court today: 'This is the best feeling in the world.'

His father Mark said: 'I believed 100 per cent that he was innocent and now it has been proved in court.

'I hope he will be able to build up his career again. This sort of thing would have an effect on anybody’s career.'

Solicitor Steven Barker said: 'Lewis is grateful to the jury for their consideration of his case and their verdicts.

'Lewis would like to thank his family and girlfriend, everyone at Brighton and Hove Albion football club, his many friends and supporters and his legal team for their support.

'Lewis is looking forward to putting the ordeal of being wrongly accused of these matters behind him and regaining his place in the Brighton first team.'

Rodgers left court with his father by his side and refused to comment on the verdict.

His solicitor, Mark Haslam, speaking on behalf of the family, said: 'We are delighted that the jury has reached the correct verdict in this case.

'The past 18 months have been very stressful for Anton and his family so it is a great relief this long ordeal is finally over.'

In a statement, George Barker said: 'Since the day of my arrest in January 2011 I have always vigorously protested my innocence of the allegations that were made against me.

'Today the jury have confirmed my innocence and I have always had complete faith the jury would come to the correct decision.

'Having to live with these allegations over the last two years has been enormously difficult for me, for my family and for my friends. However, I have been able to rely on the knowledge of my own innocence.

'I am enormously grateful to my amazing family - and in particular my mother, Julie - for their love and support throughout the past two years.

'Being able to rely upon them at all times has been hugely reassuring to me during what has seemed at times like a nightmare.

'They are simply wonderful.'

He added: 'I am now looking forward to spending some time with my family and getting on with my life and with my football.'

Cook left court with his family without commenting.

The defendants were awarded their costs.
