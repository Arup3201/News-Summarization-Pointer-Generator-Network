Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen and their two sons Kai and Klay were all smiles as they jetted out to Brazil today to cheer on England in the World Cup.

The trio were spotted at Manchester airport with the rest of the Rooney clan as they prepared to fly out ahead of England's crunch clash against Uruguay on Thursday.

Despite Wayne and his teammates losing 2-1 to Italy at the weekend, Coleen looked hopeful of a long stay as she was accompanied by 15 pieces of luggage.

While Kai and Klay wore matching England kits with their names on the back, Coleen too had her own personally-made Louis Vuitton weekend bag with her initials on the side.

Her travel outfit was smart yet casual, opting for a white blazer with black top, faded grey skinny jeans, and finished off with some coloured gem sandals.

Their arrival might bring some good luck to Wayne, after England lost 2-1 in their opening game.

Defender: The mother-of-two has been taking on Twitter trolls who have criticised her husband's performance in the England v Italy game

Many took to Twitter to comment on what they thought was a dismal performance by one of the most experienced players in the squad, though he was put out of position to make room for Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling.

Coleen wasn’t letting any online trolls get away with the criticism directed at her and her husband, often tweeting profanity to deal with some overzealous haters. 

The family weren’t able to be in Rio for the first match, but the mother of two guarantees she’ll be cheering Wayne on throughout their campaign, however long that may be.

Good luck: No doubt Wayne will be hoping his family's presence will spur him on and not let the critics mess with his head on the pitch

Mascot: Kai wore an England kit with matching Nike trainers and his father's number on the back

Matching: Baby Klay also sported an England kit and his daddy's number

England’s next game arrives on Thursday, where they’ll be taking on Group D rivals Uruguay, who also lost their first game, to Costa Rica 3-1.

Since 1953, the national team has won three, drawn three, and lost four games against the South American side, and so far only three teams in the last century have ended up overall winners after losing their first match.

The England v Uruguay game will take place at the Arena de Sao Paulo, and kicks off at 8pm.  

Support: Wayne will be hoping to beat Uruguay after England's 2-1 defeat to Italy
