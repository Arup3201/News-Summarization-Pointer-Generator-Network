Tragic: Ronan Sexton fell off a telephone box on Brighton Promenade in Britain

She suffered a devastating brain injury and in February, Liam - who lives in Manhattan with his boys - opened up on his ongoing grief following Natasha's death, telling Anderson Cooper that her death at the age of 45 still 
doesn't seem real.

And speaking at the time, the Irish actor's sister Bernadette told how the family had been left 'bewildered' by Natasha's death, saying how her son Pascal, who has Downs Syndrome was 'much loved' by the star.

She said: 'She went to great pains to include him in everything, even an Easter egg hunt, and that just sums up the type of warm and caring person that she was.

'She was just a wonderful friend, sister-in-law and auntie to my kids. She's been a tower of strength to us in hard times in the past.

'She's also been there for my other sons and daughters.' Bernadette has five children, Emily, Conor, Louis, Manus, and Ronan, is the youngest.

Liam married Richardson in 1994 and the couple had two sons, Miche√°l, now 19, and Daniel, now 17.

And he admitted that even today he expects Natasha to come walking through the door.

'[Her death] was never real,' he told Cooper.

'It
 still kind of isn't. There's periods now in our New York residence when
 I hear the door opening, especially the first couple of years... 
anytime I hear that door opening, I still think I'm going to hear her.'
