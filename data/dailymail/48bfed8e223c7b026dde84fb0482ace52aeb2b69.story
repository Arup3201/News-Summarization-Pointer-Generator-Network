Victim: Taffy Khan was fatally stabbed to during a party at boxer Herbie Hide's house

A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a fatal stabbing during a party at the home of former boxing world champion Herbie Hide.

Revellers looked on in horror as Tafadzwa Khan - known as Taffy - was knifed up to three times in the chest when fighting broke out at the troubled sportsman’s £1.5million mansion.

It is believed the 'gentle giant' may have been trying to break up a fight.

Up to 300 people travelled from across the country for the party at the isolated country mansion in Bawburgh, on the outskirts of Norwich.

Devout Christian Mr Kahn, 25, was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after.

He is thought to 
have been knifed in front of several witnesses during a row in a bar 
area beside the indoor swimming pool at the luxury home.

He is then believed to have staggered outside with at least one knife wound to his abdomen and collapsed on a patio area.

Police believe up to 300 people 
attended the party at the £1.5m manor house which Hide had built around 
15-years ago in Long Lane, Bawburgh near Norwich, Norfolk.

Detectives confirmed that Hide, 39, 
was not at the party at the time of the stabbing, but was thought to 
have been at his home earlier in the evening.

Scott Higgins, 17, who lived with Mr 
Khan at the YMCA hostel in Norwich, said: 'He was a lovely geezer who 
always had a smile on his face.

'I heard that a full on fight kicked 
off at the party and Taffy went to calm things. He is the sort of guy 
who would have wanted people to just chill and settle down.

'But an hour later this guy came back
with a knife and stabbed him three times in the chest. He was a big 
lad, but he didn’t stand a chance against a knife.

'All hell then broke loose and the guy who did the stabbing managed to get away.'

Det Supt Julian Gregory of the Norfolk
and Suffolk Police Major Investigation team confirmed that Hide who won
the WBO world heavyweight title in 1994 and 1997 was not a suspect.

Police received a 999 call at 12.07am 
on Sunday to say that a man had either been shot or stabbed at the 
five-bedroom home, which also has its own gym and disco area.

of crime officers launched a forensic search of the house as daylight 
broke and the property was sealed off while officers scoured the scene 
for evidence.

Mr Khan is thought to have been born in Africa, but grew up in Norwich. He is believed to have lived at the YMCA for around five years.

He was jobless, but he described himself on as Twitter as being a 'lyricist poetic rapper and MC'.

Mr Higgins added: 'He was a very popular guy. He loved to keep fit and did a bit of boxing and kick boxing. He went to the gym every day and kept really healthy.'

Several friends of Mr Khan fought back tears as they left flowers, balloons and candles in his memory at a makeshift shrine outside the YMCA in St Giles St, Norwich.

A friend who only gave her name as Jade, 20, said: 'If someone was in trouble, he would always help them out. He was a really nice bloke.'

Detective
Superintendent Julian Gregory, from the joint Norfolk and Suffolk Major
Investigation Team, said: ‘We are in the early stages of our 
investigation and working to establish the sequence of events which led 
to this man's death.

‘Police family liaison officers have been assigned to work with next-of-kin.

‘A large number of people are known to have been present at the property at the time and while we continue our efforts to identify and speak to all party goers.

'I would urge anyone who left the scene before speaking to police to contact Norfolk Constabulary as soon as possible on 101.’

Det Supt Gregory confirmed that a 
police armed response team was initially sent to the house because of 
fears that firearms were involved.

Paramedics found Mr Khan unresponsive 
when they arrived and tried to revive him, but he was pronounced dead at
the scene at 12.44am.

Police say the victim died from single stab wound, but had multiple injuries.

Police immediately cordoned off the 
house which is set in nine acres of grounds and erected a white tent at 
the spot where the victim was found.

Officers took the names and addresses 
of around 100 people who were still at the party and statements were 
taken from those who witnessed the stabbing.

A white forensic tent was erected on the patio to preserve possible clues at the spot where the man was found stabbed.

'We want to make it clear to the person responsible that there were a lot of witnesses and we will find you'

Four cars were left parked on the 
gravel driveway outside the house and three children's bikes and a 
trampoline were on the lawn.

Father-of-four Mr Hide lives at the house with his wife and two of his children.

Det Supt Gregroy said up to 100 people
were at the party, but it could have been attended by up to 300 guests 
from around the country.

He confirmed that many people 
including the suspected killer had left by the time officers arrived, 
but Hide's wife Helen was thought to have been in the house.

He said: 'There appears to have been some form of disturbance which may have calmed down, but then it started again.

'We are getting an emerging picture of
a dispute and an argument and an altercation between individuals. The 
victim was stabbed in front of a number of people.

'It is still under investigation, but we believe it may have happened in a pool bar area where people were congregating.

'We want to make it clear to the 
person responsible that there were a lot of witnesses and we will find 
you. We want the person to come forward as soon as possible.

'We are fairly certain that Mr Hide 
was not on the premises at the time. He may have been there earlier in 
the evening, but at the time of the incident he was elsewhere.

'Mr Hide has now relocated somewhere 
away from his house while we continue our inquiries. We have been in 
contact with him. Obviously he is concerned about what has happened at 
his home. He wants to get back there.

'We are in the early stages of our investigation and working to establish the sequence of events which led to this man's death.

'We are also in the process of 
confirming the victim's identity and police Family Liaison Officers have
been assigned to work with next of kin.

'A large number of people are known to
have been present at the property at the time and while we continue our
efforts to identify and speak to all party goers, I would urge anyone 
who left the scene before speaking to police to contact Norfolk 
Constabulary as soon as possible on 101.'

Det Supt Gregory said the cause of the argument at the party was still 'unclear'. He declined to say if a weapon had been recovered.

A neighbour who asked not to be named 
said: 'I was not disturbed at all by the party, but I was woken up by 
all the police activity at about 4am.

'Hide does not have a lot to do with 
the village. You see him going on training runs with his earphones on 
and he grunts to say hello.'

Police said officers would be providing high visibility reassurance patrols in the area today and a Home Office postmortem examination was expected to take place this afternoon.

Anyone who has information about the incident is urged to contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

Innocent: Herbie Hide was cleared of a rape charge after the prosecution offered no evidence

Hide who was born in Nigeria and moved to Britain as a boy began his boxing career in 1989.

He won his first world title in 1994 by knocking out Tommy Morrison, but lost the following year to Riddick Bowe.

Hide won the WBO title again by 
beating Tony Tucker in 1997, but he lost it to 6ft 8ins tall Ukranian 
giant Vitali Klitschko in 1999.

The boxer was cleared of a rape charge
at Norwich Crown Court last July after prosecutors offered no evidence.
He had consistently denied raping a woman in November 2010.

Hide said he was seeking further legal
advice to see if he had any civil redress against the woman who made 
the allegation and the Crown Prosecution Service for bringing the case 
to court.

He added after the hearing that he 
felt bitter about the woman keeping her anonymity while he was named in 
press reports after being charged.

Hide reportedly splashed out £150,000 on antiques to furnish his new home after moving in around 15 years ago.

He joked at the time that he was going
to call the house SheWish - short for She Wished She Lived Here - as a 
warning to scare off gold digging women.

But instead he has called it Longland Farm, the traditional name of the farmhouse which used to be on the land.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
