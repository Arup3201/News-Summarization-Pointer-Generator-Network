Homeowners face curbs on CCTV cameras on their properties after a surge of complaints about spying neighbours.

Gripes about security cameras attached to neighbouring buildings, including homes and shops, to deter crime have almost tripled to six a day amid fears about snooping, it has emerged.

The independent surveillance camera commissioner, Tony Porter, warned he would ask the Government to legislate if concerns about the growing use of domestic CCTV systems, which cost as little as £100, did not abate.

He has vowed to issue new guidance next March about the use of cameras on private homes to tackle mounting worries about use of the technology.

Many complaints focus on CCTV cameras which invade neighbours’ privacy by focusing on their garden or by pointing into their windows, or fears that paedophiles could use the state-of-the-art kit to leer at children.

The Office of the Surveillance Camera Commissioner has seen a rise in the number of calls from people from around two a week – or about 100 a year – to up to six a week, as many as 300 a year. Some 80 per cent are about CCTV on someone’s home.

In his annual report, Mr Porter said: ‘The use of surveillance camera systems within domestic environments continues to grow. This upsurge in domestic use is directly responsible for an increase in complaints around their use.

‘The most common concerns coming in to my inbox - around 80 per cent - are over the use of CCTV at someone’s home, in a domestic setting. The concerns are primarily about the intrusion into a neighbour's privacy.’

Commercial CCTV systems have to comply with a code of practice which sets out transparency requirements and a number of measures about how recordings can be stored and used.

Home Secretary Theresa May, arriving for a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street this morning, may face calls to crackdown on the use of CCTV cameras on people's homes

However, the code does not apply to householders who have installed CCTV to deter burglars and other crime.

Mr Porter said drones and body-worn video, including by bouncers, door supervisors or landlords, ‘present challenges’ but did not highlight any of the complaints received about the technology.
