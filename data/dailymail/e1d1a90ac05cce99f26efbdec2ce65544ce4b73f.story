'Jonny is another one of our brightest young talents, the sort of player that we are looking to build our team around over the next few seasons,' Gloucester rugby director David Humphreys told the club's official website.

'The last couple of years have, understandably given his form and international recognition, seen his profile rise considerably, so we are delighted that he sees Gloucester as the right place to continue to develop his career.'

And May added: 'I am really happy with how things are looking here. We've got some great players and look like retaining a core group going forward.

'I couldn't wait to put pen to paper - it was a simple decision. I was out of contract at the end of the season, but looking at how things are shaping up with the new coaches and players, I couldn't be happier.'

The 24-year-old has scored an impressive 45 tries in just 94 appearances for Gloucester
