Oklahoma University alumni are rallying around an African American chef who has been forced out of his job at the school's disgraced fraternity after footage emerged of members performing a racist chant.

Howard has worked at Sigma Alpha Epsilon for more than 15 years, cooking raved-about chili dogs and cheering students with his 'infectious smile', former members say.

But on Monday, his role was terminated after the university closed SAE with immediate effect.

It was a reaction to a video of fraternity brothers chanting 'There will never be a n***** in SAE' to the tune of If You're Happy And You Know It.

Support: Howard has worked as a chef at Oklahoma University's Sigma Alpha Epsilon for more than 15 years but is now unemployed because the house was shut down after members were filmed singing a racist chant

Calling for support for Howard and his family as he looks for a new job, one former SAE member created an Indiegogo fundraiser page, and wrote: 'He is going to lose his job because of a bus full of racist kids... Because of these kids' actions, many will be affected. None more so than Howard.'

Howard, he writes, 'was always there to chat with you' but now 'he is going to learn who has been working for. And through some cruel twist of fate, he has to lose the job that he has held for over a decade.'

Within roughly 12 hours, the fund had amassed $5,000.

And it is not the only one.

'Infectious smile': Howard befriended all students he came into contact with, alumni say as they raise money

'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was performed by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma on Saturday. The society has since been shut down

Simultaneously another former SAE brother set up a GoFundMe page slamming 'the disgusting chant' and lauding Howard as 'hard-working and loyal'.

That page has at least $3,000. 

A Twitter user who shared a link to the fundraising page wrote: 'I went to an OU SAE tailgate one time, (had a great time) an i met that man howard, he grills a mean burger.'

All members of the fraternity have until midnight on Monday to leave the premises, University of Oklahoma President David Boren announced at a press conference amid a chorus of furious reaction to the footage.
