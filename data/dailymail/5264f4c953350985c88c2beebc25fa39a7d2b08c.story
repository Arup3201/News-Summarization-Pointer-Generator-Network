Ryan Donaldson was back at his desk with a throbbing head and little recollection of the night before.

This, however, is no tale of drunken debauchery. Rather, the 15-year-old had just written his name in Newcastle’s history books as their youngest reserve-team scorer and his Toon-daft pals at St Cuthbert’s High School – former home of John Carver, Sting and Declan Donnelly - wanted to hear all about it.

Donaldson, though, had been knocked unconscious shortly after his record-breaking goal on a bruising night against Blackburn Rovers at Morecambe’s Christie Park and, even to this day, his memory is sketchy.

But the schoolboy had announced his arrival and big things were expected. There was an England call-up and, by the following summer, Kevin Keegan handed the teenager his debut in Mallorca. 

He shared an agent with Alan Shearer and went with Newcastle’s record goalscorer to a book-signing session at a Tesco superstore – it all amounted to Donaldson being touted as United’s next superstar.

But his is a typical tale of one hyped so young and, after failing to make the grade on Tyneside, he dropped out of the Football League. Where his tale differs from the majority, however, is that Donaldson’s career is again on the rise.

On Tuesday night, having been man-of-the-match during Cambridge United’s shock goalless draw with Manchester United in last month’s FA Cup Fourth Round, he is aiming to give Louis van Gaal the headache.

For the 23-year-old – who has scored three times at Wembley for the U’s - it is another taste of the stage he craves.

‘The first game was incredible. They’ve been criticised and we think they got a rollicking at half-time, but honestly, they’re so good,’ Donaldson told Sportsmail.

‘But we did so well and got what we deserved. For me, to get man-of-the-match was brilliant.

‘I hear Alan (Shearer) spoke really well about me at half-time and I think that bumped the vote up – us Geordies have got to stick together.

‘But we were a bit gutted over the next couple of days because we thought we were going to be the headline act – then Bradford go and win at Chelsea. But we’re dreaming of doing a Bradford now, it just shows what can happen with a bit of discipline and belief and we’re not just going for the occasion.

‘Although Angel Di Maria has promised me his shirt – I hope he doesn’t want mine because we’re running low and need to pay £40 to replace them if we do swap!’

What about Donaldson? Given that he shared an England Under-17 dressing-room with United’s Phil Jones and Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere – and scored 10 goals from 15 appearances for the young Lions - why isn’t he lining up on Tuesday night in red as opposed to yellow?

After his release from Newcastle in 2012, the midfielder moved south of the Tyne to Gateshead. He then followed former Newcastle academy boss Richard Money to Cambridge and netted twice in last season’s FA Trophy Final victory before getting the winner in the Conference Play-off Final against former club Gateshead.

He reflects: ‘I don’t think all of the hype helps when you get tagged as the next such and such. I was just a schoolkid loving playing for my hometown club.

‘When I got released I’d been there 12 years and it was difficult, but it was a bit of a relief at the same time and I admit I wasn’t good enough.

‘But when players get released too many drop out of the game– they lose hope and think their chance has gone.

‘For me, when you’re in those England squads, everyone builds you up. But in reality, only a few make it at the very top.

‘Others have to drop down and rebuild their career, I’m one of those players.’

Donaldson is taking small steps. For example, he prefers to share a house with four of his team-mates - Will Norris, Richard Tait, Liam Hurst and Rory Gaffney.

It is all a far cry from the million-pound Cheshire mansions in which their FA Cup opponents reside. Before the first game, Gary Lineker paid the boys a visit.

Donaldson is relishing taking on Louis van Gaal's side again in the FA Cup on Tuesday night

‘It was a bit scary standing having a coffee with him in the kitchen,’ said Donaldson.

‘He was making a documentary and probably thought it was a bit strange all of us living together, but it works for us.

‘We all get on well – there’s the odd argument over dishes or making the tea or playing darts, but I find living with the lads helps, especially being so far from home.’

If League Two Cambridge do pull off an upset then perhaps Van Gaal will suggest Messrs Rooney, Van Persie and Di Maria buy a pad together.

For Donaldson, another star-man showing and he might just land the move which gets him a place of his own.
