A third child has died after being found in an Ohio home with high levels of carbon monoxide.

Jakia Jones, 13, died Sunday after a relative found her unresponsive at her western Ohio home. 

The teenager was at home with her cousins Dionanna Bishop, 14, and Dejah Bishop, 13, who died Friday after they were rushed to an emergency room, according to The Dayton Daily News.

But as the family come to terms with their tragic loss, Jones' eight-year-old brother, Jahari Jones, remains on life support at Dayton Children's Hospital. 

According to police, a furnace caused the leak of carbon monoxide, an odorless and colorless gas created when some fuels are burned.  

The children lived with their grandmother, Jean Bishop who was hospitalized with pneumonia Friday.

A relative of the dead children reported to police that the kids had been sick for days. All of the children were thought to be home alone when they became ill.

Firefighters who initially responded to the home were also treated and released at Upper Valley Medical Center for possible carbon monoxide exposure, said Assistant Fire Chief Matthew Simmons.

However, James T. Ambrose, an attorney for Joseph and Kathy Caldwell, a couple who own the home said they weren't aware of furnace problems and didn't know children lived there.

They have owned the property for about 20 years and had no indication the furnace may have had a problem.

'Every time there was a problem in the home, whether it was a leaky faucet of whatever, they attended to it,' Ambrose said. 

'Whenever they were informed of anything, they addressed it appropriately and promptly.' 

He added that the Caldwells were devastated over what happened. But police said there will be a thorough review of the case  to determine whether any charges should be filed.

Preliminary autopsy results on two of the deceased children — sisters Dionanna and Dejah - showed that they died of exposure to carbon monoxide, according to Miami County coroners.

Meanwhile the children's distraught uncle Leon Bishop Sr., said he'd spent all-night praying at Dayton Children's Hospital before losing Jones.

'I'm numb,' he said. 'We're all pulling for the kids in the hospital. We're all praying. I'm getting a lot of support from friends and family.'

Shane Carter, director of the Lincoln Community Center told The Dayton Daily News that the children participated in after-school tutoring and recreational programs at the center. 

He has now planned a candlelight vigil in their memory at 6 p.m. Sunday. Additionally, the center is establishing a fund at Wright-Patt Credit Union to help the family with funeral expenses.

'My hope and prayer is that we can just be able to get the support and the resources needed to send them off the proper way,' Carter said.
