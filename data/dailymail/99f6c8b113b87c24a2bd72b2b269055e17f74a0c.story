Sirens blazing, traffic officer Mark James was in hot pursuit of a speeding driver doing 52mph in a 35mph zone.

But Officer James had to abandon the high speed chase - to save a mother and her two ducklings from the road.

Footage from the patrol car's dash cam has been posted to YouTube by Portland Police, who may also be hoping that someone will identify the speeding car.

Scroll down for video

The chase began when a black car doing 52mph in a 35mph zone sped past Officer Mark James

Officer James put his siren on and gave chase, but quickly had to give up when he spotted the ducks

The mother and her two ducklings waddled in front of the car, unaware that they had just helped an offender

The officer is seen slowing down on NW Bridge Avenue to avoid hitting the family, who waddle around the road blissfully unaware that they have just given avian aid to the offender, who was long gone by the time the chase resumed.

Officer James is shown walking towards 
the family, and a caption on the video reassured viewers that: 'the duck
family was safely escorted to water in a ditch and swam away'.

It added: 'The traffic violator swam away too.'

The video ends with a shot of the force's badge and a motto: 'Friends of waterfowl since 1871'.

Officer James blocked traffic and got out of the car to usher the ducks to safety

With the ducks swimming away from danger, Officer James headed back to the car, but it was too late to catch the speeding driver

The officer's good deed was largely applauded by the force's Facebook fans when it was posted it to its page.

But one Facebook user commented: 'Really? He let a speeder going 17mph OVER the speed limit get away for a duck? Hopefully the speeder didn't cause any accidents and next time he will get a ticket!'

As another user pointed out: 'Drivers trying to avoid the ducks or making emergency stops on a narrow road, were much more likely to cause an accident than a driver going a few miles over speed'.
