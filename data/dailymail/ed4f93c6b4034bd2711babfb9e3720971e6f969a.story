Australian health workers could soon be on their way to help fight against Ebola in west Africa.

The federal government has reportedly reached a deal with Britain that gives it confidence to help send Australian workers.

The prime minister's office did not confirm the report but said the government is considering discussions it has had with partners, in particular the United Kingdom and United States, about the evolving situation, including measures to treat health workers.

'The government is considering these discussions and how it might best contribute further to the response,' a spokesman said on Tuesday.

Up until now it has been reluctant to send health workers to Ebola-affected areas, arguing there is no way to get them home safely if they catch the virus.

They have been negotiating to set up evacuation plans with various countries.

Fairfax Media has reported it has sealed a deal and the government will announce an agreement with a British field hospital in Sierra Leone, and that Britain has agreed to treat Australian volunteers as if they were their own.

Infected Australian workers would be evacuated to Britain or possibly access treatment in Germany, Fairfax says.

The ABC says it has been told cabinet's National Security Committee had decided to assist volunteers who want to travel to Ebola hotspots in Sierra Leone.

Labor has argued the best way to fight Ebola is at its source in west Africa.

'I would be delighted to see Australia increase its efforts,' Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek told AAP on Tuesday.

'That includes our government supporting Australian health workers willing and able to go to help on the ground.' 

Australian Medical Association president Brian Owler said he would welcome the news, if it proved to be true.

He said there are many doctors and nurses keen to do this work and who understood the risks involved.

'It says a lot about the courage and commitment of doctors and nurses to their fellow man that they do put themselves in harm's way to go and do this incredibly important work,' Professor Owler told AAP.

Ebola has killed almost 5000 people so far and the World Health Organisation has recorded more than 13,000 cases but says the real number of infections and deaths could be much higher.

Australia has enhanced border screening of people arriving from west African countries.

The government says it's ready to deal with any confirmed Ebola cases here or in the region.
