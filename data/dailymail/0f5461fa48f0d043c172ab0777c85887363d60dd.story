A 93-year-old war hero was ‘stripped of his dignity’ and left to die in agony by staff at an NHS hospital, his family claim.

Frank Foster’s anguished screams were ignored by nurses, who left him face down on a urine-soaked bed, they say.

Mr Foster’s daughter Joanne Fowler ended up sleeping at his side on the ward at Tunbridge Wells Hospital, Kent, because she was so worried staff were not doing anything to ease the pain as he suffered a fatal brain tumour.

Mrs Fowler, 57, whose father fought in the Second World War and still had shrapnel in his shoulder from being shot at El Alamein in 1942, said: ‘He would have suffered less in battle than he did at that hospital at the hands of nurses who ignored his cries for help.

‘It would have been better if he’d died in the war. If I had known a fraction of what my father was about to suffer in hospital, without a doubt I would have killed him with my own hands.’

She has released harrowing photographs she took of her father, who was deaf and blind, after making an official complaint about his care.

Mrs Fowler added: ‘It was the most horrific thing. He was screaming in pain and the nurses wouldn’t do anything. He was visibly distressed and was tearing his clothes off because he was in so much agony ... when he died it was a relief to us all.’

Mrs Fowler, a self-employed designer, recorded his cries, as well as a nurse threatening to ask her to leave after she complained.

The hospital has launched an investigation.

His daughter Joanne Fowler was so appalled by the treatment of her father that she took the pictures

Former soldier Mr Foster, from Tunbridge Wells, served with the King’s Royal Rifle Corps and 2 Queen Victoria’s Rifles (Territorial).

He suffered his shoulder wound when he was shot from behind at El Alamein in North Africa, where in 1942 two battles were won which helped change the course of the war. After returning home, he became an accountant and married his wife Jean in 1952.

They went on to have five children, four grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.

Mr Foster went into hospital on May 22 for ongoing care for a brain tumour and was admitted to a ward the next day.

Mrs Fowler said she begged the nurses for pain relief for her father but his buzzer was ignored ‘constantly’ and a doctor was only called after she pleaded with staff for four hours.

She also claimed that at one point  a nurse came in and ‘angrily squirted’ some pain relief into his mouth with a syringe, without saying anything.

In one of her recordings, a nurse apparently threatens to have Mrs Fowler removed from the hospital after she asks how much pain her father will be forced to endure.

He can be heard crying out in agony in the clip, while his daughter says: ‘My dad is in the most horrendous pain and this shouldn’t  be happening.

‘Imagine the worst pain imaginable and that is what my dad is going through right now.’

The nurse then replies: ‘I will have you removed. What would you like me to do?’

Mrs Fowler claims she had previously found her father in a toilet covered in dried faeces after being left alone by staff, and that relatives had to clean him up themselves when he wet himself in distress.

Fought in the deserts of North Africa, there were two Battles of El Alamein in Egypt in 1942.

The first attempt stalled the Axis advance into Egypt with the second was hailed as a major turning point in the Second World War.

Axis and Allied forces had chased each other 
over the desert for three years.

The tide turned in the Allies' favour 
at the Second Battle. British General Montgomery 
spent months building up an overwhelming advantage in men and armour, 
before launching his attacks against Field Marshal Rommel's German and 
Italian troops.

It led to the retreat of the Afrika Corps and the German surrender in North Africa in May 1943.

Mr Foster died on June 13, six days after his daughter found him naked, face down on his bed. He is survived by his wife, 83.

A spokesman for Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: 'We are very sorry that Mrs Fowler felt her experience of her late father’s care did not meet the high standards of care, comfort and dignity we are committed to providing our patients at all times.

'We are taking these allegations extremely seriously and have commissioned a full independent review of Mr Foster’s care to establish the facts, provide assurance and will not hesitate to take any actions found necessary.

'We have spoken to and are meeting with Mrs Fowler to discuss her concerns in detail as part of this process.

'We cannot discuss individual areas of Mr Foster’s care while the investigation establishes exactly what happened. We monitor individual aspects of every patient’s care and pain relief is administered carefully and according to individual clinical needs.

'Our absolute priority is to provide the best possible care to all of our patients at all times.'

His relatives have also complained about Firtree House Care Home in Tunbridge Wells, where Mr Foster spent a week between hospital stays in May, because his call button did not work.

The home confirmed it had ‘experienced technical problems with some of its call buttons’ during Mr Foster’s stay, but has since resolved the issue.

Tunbridge Wells Hospital in Kent has since launched an internal investigation into the care of Mr Foster
