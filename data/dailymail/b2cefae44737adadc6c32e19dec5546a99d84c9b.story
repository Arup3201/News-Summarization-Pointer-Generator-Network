Tim Sherwood's arrival at Aston Villa has given the squad a new lease of life, according to experienced goalkeeper Shay Given.

After a disappointing start to his reign, in which the Villans lost two Premier League games in a row, Sherwood has turned it around with two Midlands derby wins over West Brom, first in the league and then in the quarter finals of the FA Cup.

And Given, who was in goal for the latter of the two victories, admits that at half-time in Saturday's match, Sherwood wasn't pleased with his side's performance.

'He wasn't too happy at half-time,' Given told Stan Collymore on talkSPORT. 'The flip-chart went flying in the dressing room and I think you saw our reaction in the second half, we were much better and caused West Brom a lot of problems.

'But that's what he's there to do. He's given us a rollicking when we've needed it and that's probably the first time he's really let go. I think a few of the lads were a bit shocked, but it got the reaction we needed.'

Given and Sherwood have history, too. As a player, the now Villa manager won the Premier League title with Blackburn, and a young Given was also in the squad.

'I know Tim from our Blackburn days,' Given continued. 'We were players together and he was a leader then as the captain, he captained Blackburn to the Premier League title, and he's very much the same. 

'He's so positive on the training ground, so positive in the stadium and the players are responding to that.'

Villa's league win over Tony Pulis' West Brom put some breathing space between them and the bottom three, but there is still a long way to go if they are to avoid the drop.

According to Given, Sherwood was a leader on the pitch with Blackburn and he is the same as a manager
