Darko Milanic is set to be announced as the new head coach at Leeds United on Monday after Austrian side SK Sturm Graz confirmed his departure.

The 46-year-old's appointment would make him the club's first non British or Irish manager as owner Massimo Cellino's search to replace David Hockaday looks close to a conclusion.

Sportsmail takes a look at the profile of the potential new Elland Road boss.

Playing Career

Born on 18 December 1967 in Izola, Slovenia, Milanic began his career with the local side before joining Serbian powerhouse FK Partizan at the age of 17 in 1986. 

During his seven years in Belgrade, Milanic became a cornerstone of their defence helping them to win the Yugoslav First League title and two Yugoslav Cups before moving to Sturm Graz in 1993.

Whilst in Austria, Milanic enjoyed a trophy-laden seven years with the side as they won two consecutive Austrian Bundesliga titles, three Austrian Cups and three Austrian Supercups.

International Pedigree

An important defender for club and country, the 46-year-old earned 42 caps for Slovenia between 1992 and 2000.

The pinnacle of his international career would have undoubtedly have been captaining Slovenia to the finals of Euro 2000, held in Belgium and Holland, after beating Ukraine in a play-off.

Their debut appearance in a major competition saw them yield two points from their three matches with Milanic starting the first two games - a 3-3 draw against Yugoslavia and a 2-1 defeat against Spain.

Milanic retired from professional football at the age of 33 due to injury.

Managerial Career

Upon retiring, Milanic pursued a career in management where he was appointed the boss of Slovenian side NK Primorje in 2004 before becoming an assistant coach at Austria club SK Sturm Graz two years later.

The 2007-08 season saw Milanic back in the managerial pressure cooker this time in Slovenia at Gorica before he enjoyed a successful spell at rivals Maribor the following season.

There he won nine trophies during his five years at the club guiding them to four league titles, three Slovenian Cups and two Slovenian Supercups.

His feats at Maribor saw him become the first coach to have won all three domestic trophies in Slovenian club football.

After five successful years at Maribor, Milanic returned to SK Sturm Graz on a three-year contract in June 2013 where he led the club to a fifth place finish during his first year in charge.

Anything else you need to know?

There shouldn't be any problems of communication between Milanic and his inherited Leeds squad if he takes the reins at Elland Road. 

The Slovenian can speak five languages so getting his tactics across to his players shouldn't be any problem as the club look to return to the top flight of English football since their relegation in 2004.
