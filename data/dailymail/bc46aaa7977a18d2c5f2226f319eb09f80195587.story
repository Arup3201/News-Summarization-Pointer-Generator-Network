A controversial new social experiment is endeavoring to interview white people all over the United States in an effort to document 'their understanding of their own whiteness' - and is causing an online furor while doing so.

Some 24 people have already been interviewed for The Whiteness Project - all from Buffalo, New York - with a goal of getting 1,000 from all parts of the country, with the resultant videos to air in packages on PBS.

In the first video installment to be released, a woman compares the discrimination she receives for having multiple tattoos to the judgement a black person might receive.

'I get discriminated against just as much as a minority does,' she said.

Causing a stir: The Whiteness Project, a social experiment organized by documentary filmmaker Whitney Dow, is seeking to interview 1,000 across America asking them to explain their 'whiteness'

Opinions: The first wave of the campaign, featuring 24 interviews with people from Buffalo, New York, has been attacked for 'mostly just criticizing minority groups' 

Hardships: The multi-platform investigation into 'how Americans who identify as ''white'' experience their ethnicity'

'I’m not a normal-looking white woman.

'I’m a tattoo-ed woman ... so you can’t put me in the same boat (as black people).'

One elderly gentleman, Harold, says that he believes white people are now more often discriminated against than black people.

Another woman, who described herself as voluptuous, said she doesn't like the reaction she gets from black men when she's dressed provocatively.

'When you smile and say hello (to a black man), that is not an invitation to follow me and come to my door,' the woman says in her video. 

The campaign has been furiously attacked on social media.

Critics like  Miles Klee from The Daily Dot claimed most of the white people spent their interview time 'criticizing minorities',Gothamist reported.

Klee said the videos could 'easily be mistaken for satire where it not for the involvement of PBS'.

The Whiteness Project is being helmed by documentary filmmaker Whitney Dow.

Online anger: Many took to Twitter to vent over the project when it debuted

Is it a joke? Some people believed the video interviews were satirical and not actually serious

Controversial: Some of the people interviewed had strange opinions on minority groups

Dow admitted on Twitter to having nerves about debuting the project and he was worried about people's reactions.

'A bit nervous as I know it has a huge chance of being misunderstood,' Dow posted online.

'White people have been very tentative about engaging.'

'POC either get it right away or are hugely offended.'

Dow has since shut down the Twitter page for the Whiteness Project, which had only about 40 followers.

He said in his artistic statement that the point of the experiment was to investigate something that hasn't been explored before.

In charge: The Whiteness Project is the brainchild of documentary filmmaker Whitney Dow

'Most people take for granted that there is a “white” race in America, but rarely is the concept of whiteness itself investigated.

'What does it mean to be a “white”? Can it be genetically defined? Is it a cultural construct? A state of mind?

'How does one come to be deemed “white” in America and what privileges does being perceived as white bestow?'

It is unclear whether the Whiteness Projects interviews will continue in the wake of the controversy.
