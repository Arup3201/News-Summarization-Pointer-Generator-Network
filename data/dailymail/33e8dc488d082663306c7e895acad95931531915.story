Military veteran Charlie Mayes, 40, was charged with child cruelty

A father has been arrested for child cruelty after punishing his teenage son by making him carry a 23-pound paving slab for miles. 

Military veteran Charlie Mayes, 40, from Douglasville, Georgia, told police he used military-style punishment because his son watched too many videos and didn't do his chores and school work. 

According to Police Sergeant Todd Garner, of Douglasville Police, the 16-year-old boy was made to carry the paving slab several times over a three-day period.

He was sometimes made to get up and carry the slab for miles at around three o'clock in the morning. 

A pizza delivery driver called Joshua Burnette alerted police after spotting the struggling teenager on one of his punishment walks.

He told Douglas County Sentinel: 'I got to work and saw him there and I asked if he was alright.

'He was sweating, dirty and was obviously tired. He asked if I could give him a ride so I checked with my boss and he said it was okay.

'He picked up this massive brick and asked if he could put in in the truck.'

Burnette then spotted the boy a few hours later walking with the slab in temperatures reaching 90F.

After quizzing the boy, the driver discovered that the teenager had been made to walk with the brick as punishment and that he had to do the walk within two hours or face doing the whole thing again.

One walk was also captured in the background of a police dash cam video during an unrelated traffic stop but this footage has not yet been released.

The boy, who is only 4ft 2in tall, was also punished in-between the three-mile hikes.

Torture: Charlie Mayers made his 16-year-old son carry this 23-pound paving slab for miles as punishment

Garner told 11Alive: 'In between that time, he was at home having to move rocks 
and stuff from one side of the back yard to the other and then being 
taken right back out to the same location and dropped off and made to 
walk back again.'

Police Sgt Garner said: 'He did not feel that this was inappropriate at all and neither did his wife.'

Mayers said the boy had a history of problems at school and that his parents finally decided to home school him.

However, Mayers said the problems continued.

He told Judge Joel Dodson: 'I had tried everything else and nothing seemed to work.

'I know it may be an adult punishment and he is a 16-year-old boy. It was something we did when I was in the military.

'The sergeant would have us move rocks. I know how it sounds, but we did that all the time.'

Mayes was charged with first-degree child cruelty which he admitted.

A woman who answered the door at the family house said they had no comment.

Mayers was released from jail on a $3,500 bond and a judge ordered the father to receive family counseling.
