Mick Channon did not get where he is today — master of all he surveys at the splendid West Ilsley stables in Berkshire — by mincing his words.

‘For me, Wayne Rooney is not the strong link, he’s the weak link,’ says the 65-year-old former England striker of the man whose form seems crucial if Roy Hodgson’s team are to prosper at the World Cup.

‘I’ve got a lot of time for him but he’s never delivered in World Cups, has he? This time, he’s got to come to the party. It’s time to step up, boy.’

Improvement needed: Mick Channon speaks to Sportsmail, and admits Rooney is England's weak link

The man? Rooney, going to his third World Cup, is desperate to prove his worth on the biggest stage

Channon’s own football career sometimes seems to him like another lifetime now he is a Flat racing trainer of renown but he remains a perceptive football  analyst, especially of those who operate where he used to, in and around the opposition penalty area.

He has reservations about all four forwards — Rooney, Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck and Rickie Lambert — in Hodgson’s squad.

‘Sturridge and Welbeck have got legs, but whether they’re good enough, or have the right temperament, I’m not so sure,’ says Channon.

‘They’re only going to pick up bits and pieces out there. They’ve got to make something out of nothing, and can they adapt to that? If anyone thinks England are going to play an all-out attacking game, well, they might as well keep the plane engines running because they’ll be coming straight home.’

As for Lambert, a potent force with Channon’s beloved Southampton, he says: ‘He has a good football brain. He lacks pace, but he’s a decent finisher. If we’re winning 1-0, stick him on, he might get another but I’m sure Hodgson will start with Rooney, more for what he’s capable of, not for what he’s done.’

That said, Channon thinks England will make it through the group stages. ‘If we play as a team, we’ll do better than people think.

Caps: 46. Goals: 21 (inc 2 pens)

Debut: October 11, 1972 (age 23) England 1 Yugoslavia 1

First goal: Scotland 0 England 5 February 14, 1973

Last goal: England 1 Scotland 2 June 4, 1977

Last match:  Switzerland 0 England 0 September 7, 1977

Channon is 18th on the list of England’s all-time top scorers — equal with Kevin Keegan.

He is the most capped England player never to play in a major tournament.

'My first choice was Harry Redknapp to be England manager, but I respect Hodgson. He has them functioning as a team. Whether they’re good enough is another matter.

‘For years managers have been obsessed with picking the best players in each position, but it’s not the best players who make the best team. That’s why Germany have done so well, and (Hodgson) understands it too, as Alf Ramsey did.

‘Look at the team who won in 1966. Bobby Charlton was a luxury. He never tackled anyone in his life. Alf played Nobby Stiles so that he could afford the luxury of Charlton. He sacrificed Jimmy Greaves, and played Roger Hunt and Geoff Hurst because they worked hard. And he never asked you to do something you didn’t do at club level. That was Alf’s great strength.’

Channon made his England debut under 
Ramsey, against Yugoslavia in October 1972. There were still two World 
Cup winners in the side, Bobby Moore and Alan Ball, and when Channon won
 the last of his 46 England caps five years (and 21 goals) later, he 
lined up alongside Kevin Keegan and Trevor Francis.

Yet those were barren years for England. At least Rooney still has the chance to score in a World Cup. Channon never even got there.

‘Yeah, I can still remember sitting in the dressing room after the Poland game (October 1973, when a 1-1 draw at Wembley meant England missed out on the 1974 finals).

‘That wasn’t where we threw it away, 
though. It was in Poland where we got beat two-zip. It was one of Alf’s 
rare mistakes. But Alf’s teams were the best I played in for England. 
The very best was probably the one that got stopped by the Poland 
keeper, Jan Tomaszewski.

‘Later, under Don Revie, we had good players without being a team. He kept making changes. Under Alf, once you got into the side, the hardest thing was to get out of it.’

Hodgson not only understands the team ethic as Ramsey did,  ventures Channon, but he inspires similar loyalty. ‘The players seem to like him and believe in what he’s doing. They’re probably not as good as the players Alf had, but he can make them hard to beat.

‘That back four has to be solid. Gerrard will sit deep, so we don’t get exposed. After that, he needs a hod-carrier like Bally. Who will that be? Jordan Henderson? Going forward from the middle Ross Barkley is terrific but he’s maybe a bit naive. I’d start with Adam Lallana. He makes things happen.’

Channon adds that Southampton will not easily replace Lallana if the player is sold this summer. ‘You’re always sad to lose players who can win games for you. I was one, Matt Le Tissier was another. If you don’t replace them with a match-winner, you’re in trouble.’

He buys four Southampton  season tickets every year, he says, but such are the demands of horse racing, Channon gets to St Mary’s only five or six times. ‘My two sons go, and the grandchildren. They’re Southampton nuts.’

When he does go, does he still find himself besieged by autograph hunters? After all, he scored a record 185 league goals for the Saints, and was instrumental in the famous FA Cup win of 1976.

Channon snorts. ‘I don’t go because I want people to tell me how great I was. I’ve no time for all that.’

All the same, he is not immune to nostalgia. Hanging in his office is a huge black-and-white photograph of him in his Southampton days, alongside his great mate, the late Alan Ball. ‘Bless him,’ he says, with a smile.

England could do with a latter-day Ball now, I suggest. ‘Yeah, but they’ve got what they’ve got.’

There’s no arguing with that, and so assuming that England will not win the World Cup, who will?

‘Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Germany. Probably one of those. And Belgium have a lot of good players, haven’t they? But I keep coming back to it. The best players don’t necessarily make the best team.’
