A man has been awarded £450,000 for being disabled at birth by blundering medics - after a psychic convinced the family to pursue their claim.

Jamie Lewis, 23, of Caerphilly, south Wales, has never been able to use his left arm after errors made during his birth.

Staff at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, south Wales, used 'excessive force' during his mother's labour, and damaged nerves in her son's neck, leaving his left arm and hand permanently paralysed, according to lawyers who won the payout.

His mother, Cheryl Lewis-Thomas, attempted to make a claim against the then Powys local health board when her son was four years old, but couldn't find a firm which would take up her case.

She thought her chances of a successful claim were small so gave up - but was persuaded years later to renew her efforts during a meeting with a psychic.

She added: 'I visited a psychic in Wales
 who told me that my son would win a claim and she could see us very 
happy. I thought we had nothing to lose so Jamie decided to give the 
claim another go.'

Claim: Mr Lewis's mother, Cheryl Lewis-Thomas, was persuaded by a psychic to pursue the case

'Jamie had a tough childhood growing up with no use in his arm. He was unable to play with other children, use his bicycle and the appearance of his arm also made him a target for bullying. I knew the way he was treated during the birth wasn’t right and it wasn’t any fault of his own.'

Spurred on by the spiritual advice, she approached Fletchers Solicitors, who took up her claim and were able to secure the six-figure sum.

The Aneurin Bevan local health board, the successor of the organisation responsible for Mr Lewis's treatment at birth, agreed to settle the matter out of court for £450,000. However, it did not admit full liability.

Acting solicitor in the case Emma Jordan said if the hospital had admitted the problem when it first occurred then the Mr Lewis’ recovery would likely have been far better.

She said: 'Unfortunately, it took over 20 years for Jamie and his mum to achieve justice for what happened.

'The compensation secured for Jamie takes into account the extent of the injuries he suffered and his future needs, and will allow him to enjoy an optimistic future with his wife and two children.'
