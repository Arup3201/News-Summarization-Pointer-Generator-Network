A former racing driver and close friend of Lewis Hamilton died following an horrific 78mph crash at a roundabout following a night out drinking with friends.

Christian Bakkerud, a 26-year-old Dane, suffered fatal head injuries when his silver Audi RS6 ‘beast of a car’ was hurled through the air and torn to pieces.

The car smashed into a barrier before somersaulting through the air and landing on top of a metre high wall which ripped the suspension away.

It finally came to rest on top of a railing which bent what was left of the car in half, Westminster Coroner’s Court heard.

Mr Bakkerud had competed in the British Formula Three and Hamilton wore his initials on his helmet after his death as a tribute.

PC Peter Traylor told the court that Mr Bakkerud’s car left behind a scene of devastation with car parts littering the road.

He added: ‘When you look at the car itself, it is capable of 150mph. In January 2010 it was described at Audi’s single most powerful car.

‘It is a beast of a car, it’s got all the safety features you can imagine.’

PC Traylor said there was no evidence Mr Bakkerud had applied the brakes.

‘When you look at somebody taking that sort corner you will get to the left hand side to flatten out the corner,’ he explained.

‘If Mr Bakkerud was on a race track he would be doing the same kind of lines to get around a bend, but he wasn’t doing that in this case,’ he added.

PC Traylor explained that CCTV stills showed the former championship driver positioned in the middle of the road before the collision in Tibbets Corner, Putney, on September 10.

Mr Bakkerud was taken to St George’s Hospital in Tooting after a passer-by called the emergency services who found him unconscious at the scene.

He was found to be suffering from severe head injuries including a fractured skull and swelling of the brain. He also suffered fractured vertebrae and internal injuries.

Mr Bakkerud never regained consciousness and died in hospital the following day.

The court heard that he had been out the night before the crash drinking with friends and celebrating a birthday.

Mr Bakkerud was planning to drive down to his parents’ house in Esher that night

Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: ‘We heard that Christian Bakkerud, only 26 years of age, his occupation at the time of his death was that of a shipping broker.

‘But as we have heard from officer Traylor, of some significance is the fact that he was previously a racing car driver and a racing car driver that was well known in the racing world and successful.

‘He had an extremely powerful car. He did race cars for Audi and presumably they had given him one of these cars to thank him for the services he had provided for them,’ she added.

‘Now we know that on September 9, 2011, Mr Bakkerud went out with some friends for dinner, some alcohol was drunk over the course of the evening.’

Mr Bakkerud’s blood was never tested for alcohol but friends insisted he was not drunk.

‘One can only imagine the type of forces acting on Mr Bakkerud during the course of the collision,’ the coroner added.

‘Unusually, with such a high performance car it was matched by a high performance driver.

‘Mr Bakkerud had been previously a racing car driver, he was used to driving these sorts of cars and indeed driving Audis in particular. So it was not a matter of driver’s ability and a mismatch of the car.

‘We will never know what part alcohol played in this incident. We don’t know if Mr Bakkerud drifted off to sleep or lost momentary concentration. I am afraid we would stray into speculation.

‘What we do know is that it has been a tragic loss of a young life’ she added.

She described the pictures of the crash scene as being ‘the most remarkable’ she had seen in her career.

Before retiring from motor sport last year, he had raced in Formula BMW, British Formula 3 and GP2 (the level below Formula 1).

His career highlight was a British F3 win for Carlin at Mugello in 2006.

Mr Bakkerud’s last race was at the gruelling 24-hour race in Le Mans, France, which he was unable to finish after crashing out in 32nd place.

Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton paid tribute to his friend by wearing his initials on his helmet during the Singapore Grand Prix which took place on September 25.

Mr Bakkerud of Notting Hill, west London died of multiple injuries.

The verdict was accidental death.

Following the inquest, Mr Bakkerud’s family released a statement. They said: 'We have lost our son, a happy and smiling man who was a key part of our lives, and an upcoming responsible husband to his fiancée. Christian was popular with a lot of people and had many friends.

'At the funeral the church was full of friends, loved ones and highly regarded colleagues in motorsports. They flew in from across the world, a thing which really moved us. 

'All those who know and have worked with Christian in international motorsports will know what a talented driver he was. Christian was well-known and respected; he was a safe and well regarded racing driver known for his patience and respect of other drivers.

'He prided himself on discipline, and always worked with the upmost responsibility. He conducted his life with balance and respect, and he will be greatly missed by all who knew him.'
