ITV is ruining its television dramas by saturating them with advert breaks, one of its own top screenwriters has claimed.

Award-winning author Anthony Horowitz, who is the creator of detective thriller Foyle’s War, said chopping dramas up was ‘absolutely terrible.’

Following widespread frustration at the number of commercials in hit costume drama Downton Abbey, he said writer have had to put extra cliffhangers into their scripts.

Mr Horowitz, 59, said that while writing Midsomer Murders, he had to keep killing off characters to keep viewers engaged before each break, meaning the much-loved series became a ‘bloodbath’.

He told the Hay Festival: ‘It is absolutely terrible the way television is chopped into so many little bits. The story has to be designed to work around that. So you have 18 minutes for your first part, 15 minutes for your second part and the last parts are only ten minutes each.

‘Your story is cut down into little wedges, so you have to be sure that each wedge, each section, satisfies the audience and they keep coming back from the commercial break. That requires really careful planning.’

Mr Horowitz began writing for TV in the 1980s and penned several Hercule Poirot stories and the first 14 episodes of detective series Midsomer Murders, which is known for dispatching its characters in grisly and inventive ways.

But he said the body count became unnecessarily high because of the number of advert breaks. He said: ‘There was a stupid thing that whenever there was a commercial break I would kill somebody, and there were so many breaks it was a bit of a bloodbath. After 14 episodes I realised there was no one left in Midsomer Murders.’

Last week, viewers complained the semi-finals it ITV’s reality show Britain’s Got Talent were ruined by the constant adverts, screened between each act. Last year, Downton Abbey came under fire after a 90-minute programme contained six breaks, taking up almost 20 minutes of screen time.

However, TV commentator Vivienne Pattison, who runs campaign group Mediawatch-UK, said yesterday she could see no alternative to having frequent advert breaks on commercial television.

She said: ‘I do sympathise with the view that advert breaks are annoying. I don’t think anybody likes them. But unfortunately that is just the nature of the beast. Without adverts, ITV would not be able to fund its dramas in the first place, so they are sadly necessary.’

In 2011, broadcasting regulator Ofcom changed its rules to allow ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 to screen a maximum of 12 minutes of adverts per hour, an increase from the previous seven minutes.

As well as writing for television, Mr Horowitz has penned a string of successful novels, including the popular Alex Rider spy series for teenagers.

He told the hay festival he had to be careful not to make his children’s fiction too dark, in particular the4 penultimate Alex Rider book Scorpia Rising.

He said: ‘There is a lot of death in my books and I do not know why. As I get older my books have got darker. Scorpia Rising becomes very close to being cruel, and I had to be very careful not to make it too dark.’

The author also revealed he based one of his characters on singer Sir Elton John after learning the star spent £50,000 a year on flowers.

He said: ‘How can anyone in their right mind do that? He must be mad. So I created a character based on him, called Damian Cray. He was vaporised on a tea trolley.’
