The father of hammer attack survivor Josie Russell has joined more than 60 people suing News International over alleged phone hacking, it emerged last night.

Shaun Russell, whose daughter survived a frenzied attack in which her sister and mother were killed in 1996, believes his phone was hacked by reporters at the News of the World.

He was one of a number of possible victims who have issued legal writs against the group that owned the former Sunday tabloid.

Others include Sara Payne - the mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah - a prominent campaigner who worked closely with the newspaper for many years.

Together they successfully lobbied for what became known as Sarah’s Law - legislation that enables people to check if those living close to their children are paedophiles.

Princess Diana’s former butler Paul Burrell, pop star Dannii Minogue, and July 7 suicide bomb attacks hero Paul Dadge are also suing Rupert Murdoch’s media company.

Politicians Denis MacShane, Simon Hughes, Mark Oaten, Tessa Jowell, Chris Bryant and George Galloway are also taking legal action.

Kylie Minogue has said her phone could have been hacked while she was suffering from breast cancer.

As she picked up an honorary doctorate, the star spoke of the challenges of fighting the disease while in the spotlight.

She said being in the public eye had been a 'blessing' because of the support she received but a 'curse' because of occasional media intrusion.

Asked if her phone had been hacked, she added: 'It may have been.'

There was no suggestion that she was targeted by any particular media company.

The singer was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and underwent surgery and chemotherapy to beat the disease.

She was given the all-clear the following year.

Another claimant is Sheila Henry, the mother of London bombing victim Christian Small, who died in the July 2005 blasts.

The new names will join other well-known figures and celebrities claiming damages that could exceed the £20million compensation fund.

Among the first to lead the charge against the newspaper were former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott, actor Jude Law and comedian Steve Coogan.

The total number is believed to have soared in recent weeks after High Court judge Mr Justice Vos set a time limit on when applications for damages could be made.

He is due to hear evidence from a group of ‘lead claimants’, representing a broad range of victims, at a hearing in January.

He
will then rule on what compensation they should expect, creating a 
blueprint for other claims in the future, in the hope of reducing legal 
costs.

The fresh claims are the latest development in a saga that began with the 
jailing of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and News of the World 
royal editor Clive Goodman in January 2007.

The two men admitted plotting to hack into the messages of Royal aides but the scandal lay dormant until January, when News International handed Scotland Yard evidence that others were also targeted.

The move sparked a massive outcry that led to the News of the World being shut down in July, a series of criminal investigations and a judicial inquiry into the methods and ethics of the media.

A News International spokesman said: ‘News International is committed to reaching fair and where possible swift settlements with victims of illegal voicemail interception and has unreservedly apologised to those affected.’
