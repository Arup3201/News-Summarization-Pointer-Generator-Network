Fernando Torres has a smile back on his face after silencing his critics by scoring two goals against Real Madrid to send Atletico Madrid through to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey.

The Spaniard, who begun his career at the Vicente Calderon with Atletico, had also never scored at the Bernabeu against their fierce rivals Real before the cup tie on Thursday night. 

Torres struck twice in the first minutes of each half to put his boyhood club through to the last eight with a 4-2 aggregate win, and the victory certainly pleased the striker.

'I was smiling when I came off because of the win and for scoring my first two goals (since I returned to Spain) and also for doing it in a stadium where I hadn't managed it before,' Torres, told Canal Plus.

'The fact that we scored so early meant we could play the game we wanted,' added the former Liverpool and Chelsea forward.

'We never felt the tie was in danger and we weren't under stress.'

Both Sergio Ramos and Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo scored to cancel out Torres' goals, but the European champions were already heading out after their 2-0 defeat at the Vicente Calderon meant they needed three goals to go through.

The win extended Atletico's record to five unbeaten against Real this season and sets Diego Simeone's team up with a quarter-final clash with Barcelona.
