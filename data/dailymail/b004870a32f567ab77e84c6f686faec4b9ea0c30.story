The woman who cheated on a Chelsea footballer with his teammate claims she only had the affair after her boyfriend strayed with another woman.

Rumours about a love-triangle between Caroline Lijnen, Kevin de Bruyne and Thibaut Courtois - all Belgians - first began in April 2013, but Miss Lijnen has now given her side of the story.

Miss Lijnen claims she was only intimate with Courtois after midfielder De Bruyne - who's now with German side Wolfsburg - admitted that he'd cheated on her with her best friend.

The 21-year-old says she met the giant goalkeeper during a visit to Madrid, where he was playing for La Liga side Atletico Madrid on loan from Chelsea.

She claims Courtois wined and dined her in the Spanish capital and provided her with the engaging company that De Bruyne could not during their three-year relationship.

Speaking to Story Magazine in Belgium she said: 'Kevin cheated on me. I did not say anything for months because I couldn't say anything, as Kevin's parents said they would take legal action if I gave my story. I was under pressure and I could not have contact with Kevin.

'I respected everything. But in his book Keep It Simple, Kevin wrote a passage about my affair with Thibaut. So, I decided to remain silent no longer.

'In the summer of 2012, Kevin told me that he had an affair with my old best friend. I gave him the choice: her or me. I was ready to give him another chance, but our relationship was never the same afterwards.

'[I then went to Madrid, and even] Kevin thought that this trip was a good idea. I asked him beforehand. But then something happened that should never have happened.

'That evening, Thibaut offered me what I had not received during a three-year relationship with Kevin. With Thibaut, I could talk about anything and everything and he had even prepared me a delicious meal. Kevin never did it for me.

'Kevin had deceived me and I thought "Why shouldn't I do that too?"'

De Bruyne and Courtois, who are both expected to start for Belgium against Israel in Euro 2016 qualifying on Tuesday night, were also owned by Chelsea at the same time but never played together.

The pair are believed to have patched up their differences since the incident, although the Wolfsburg midfielder was said to be 'devastated'. A spokesperson from the Belgian FA even claimed the pair now laugh about it.

Speaking to Story Magazine in April last year, press officer Stefan van Loock said: 'We don't deny that there have been private problems between Thibaut Courtois and Kevin De Bruyne.

'But I've talked to both of them and they both confirm this case is closed for them. They have finished the quarrel. The guys talk again to each other and they even make jokes again.

'It's true the national manager has talked to both of them about the case. But it never has had any impact on the Belgian national team. It's a shame this case has gone public.
