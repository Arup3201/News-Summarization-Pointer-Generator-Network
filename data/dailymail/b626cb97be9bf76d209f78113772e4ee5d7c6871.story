An angry ice cream seller, who deliberately rammed a rival’s van and broke her equipment during constant rows about their ‘patch’, has been jailed for six months.

Steffan Debattista, 20, reversed his van into rival Maxine Catalano’s, 49, vehicle in Dudley, West Midlands. 

During another attack, just 11 days later, he leant into the vehicle and broke the lever off her ice cream dispenser, flooding the van with £600 worth of ice cream.

Debattista, of Lower Gornal, was arrested after a note of his registration plate on his bright red van was made by a member of the public when he sped off with this chimes still ringing following the road rage attack on September 4. 

He was bailed by police for damaging Miss Catalano’s ‘Super Whip’ van, but 11 days later struck again by targeting the van's dispenser as Maxine sold ice cream.

Pulling up in his car, Debattista angrily told Miss Catalano that she should not be selling ice cream on his patch and demanded her boss's phone number.

When the woman from Rowley Regis, West Midlands refused, he leant into the window as children looked on and broke her machine by pulling off the handle.

Debattista was jailed for six months 
at Wolverhampton Crown Court after been found guilty by a jury of 
dangerous driving on Tuesday. He had previously admitted a charge of 
criminal damage to Miss Catalano's van. 

The court heard how Debattista launched the hate campaign to scare her out of making sales in the area he considered his patch. 

Judge Nicholas Webb told him: ‘This kind of behaviour is serious and you deserve absolutely no credit for your stance.

‘This was prolonged dangerous driving culminating in a collision and what you did must mean custody.

‘The victim was in the business of selling ice cream and you disapproved strongly of the competition she posed.

‘You set about trying to scare her from selling ice cream to members of the public.

‘You deliberately reversed into her vehicle causing several hundreds of pounds damage when you knew she was in the vehicle with a passenger.

‘Not satisfied with that 11 days later you encountered her again. 

‘You went to her ice cream machine and you manipulated the lever to the ice-cream dispenser and you poured it all over the floor.

 ‘People who drive like this has got to realise it will be taken extremely seriously by the courts. Fortunately no-one suffered any serious injury.’

Miss Catalano said that both she and her niece received back and neck injuries during the attack and she said she had been too frightened to sell ice cream regularly but will now start selling again after his sentencing yesterday.

After the case, Miss Catalano described her attacker as ‘arrogant’.

A mother-of-three who first sold ice 
cream for Ronnie O'Sullivan's uncle Antonio Catalano from 1993 until 
2004, said: ‘I never gave Steff any grief but he was arrogant and I 
think he had a problem with me because I was a woman. 

‘His anger was terrifying when he first tried to ram me. He was trying to cut in front of me and to ram me.

‘There aren't any laid down areas where you can sell and I have never had any problems with any other ice cream seller. We all normally agree amicably about where we stop to sell and at what time.

 ‘When we stopped at some traffic lights outside the old he parked adjacent.’

She said that she continued to drive around the nearby area to try and dodge him with the police emergency services on her intercom in the van as she reported the drama.

Just when she thought she had lost her tormenter he pulled out of a side street directly in front of her.

She said: ‘I saw Steffan suddenly start reversing his van directly at me and he kept accelerating then stopping in front.

‘I pulled up behind his van, which was now stopped at the lights outside the Floors 2 Go shop. 

‘I saw him suddenly start reversing his van directly at me and he collided, causing about £1,500 damage to the front of my van.’

Debattista's mother, Michelle, 44, slammed the sentence yesterday claiming that Miss Catalano ‘would wind him up’ by turning up where he was selling and would ‘make comments’ about the quality of his ice cream. 

She said: ‘He's been depressed and I'm worried about him being in prison - he's never been away from home on his own before.

‘The sentence is so unfair and harsh. Nobody was hurt and I don't believe he did what was claimed in court.’

Debattista was also banned from driving for two years and was ordered not to have any contact order with Miss Catalano or her ice cream firm.
