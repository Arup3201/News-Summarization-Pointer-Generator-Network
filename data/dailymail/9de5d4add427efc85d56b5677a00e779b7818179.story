Drivers on a Siberian motorway were joined by a jogger wearing only a bikini.

The woman, also sporting a pair of trainers, was filmed running between the lanes of a busy motorway in Tomsk at nighttime.

The runner has since been fined by traffic police for her antics on the motorway, where the speed limit is 62mph, according to the Siberian Times.

A runner was filmed running along a busy motorway in Tomsk, Siberia, wearing only a bikini and trainers

The woman was smiling as she ran between the traffic to the sound of car horns

She surely felt the cold as she jogged along a frost-covered motorway

In the 35 second clip, set to a dance music soundtrack, the woman is seen running along the snow-covered motorway to the sound of car horns.

At one point, she seems to try to attempt a Morecambe and Wise-style skip, perhaps in hope that the move would bring her some sunshine.

But it wasn't to be. Winter temperatures in Tomsk rarely go above 0C, with the average temperatures of February and March reaching -14C and -7C respectively.

If the run was a drunken prank, perhaps she had the protection of a booze blanket.

Hopefully her cheering friends holding the camera had a more practical foil blanket waiting for her at the end of her exploits.

Cheers from the person behind the camera seemed to spur her on, despite the sub-zero temperature
