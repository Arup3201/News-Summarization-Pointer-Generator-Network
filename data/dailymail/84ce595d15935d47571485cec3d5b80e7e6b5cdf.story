Concerned relatives of September 11 victims are asking the FBI to brief them on its probe into allegations that News Corp journalists hacked into terror victims' phones.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into claims that journalists from News of the World bribed New York police officers for phone records of families of those who died in the 9/11 attacks.

Sally Regenhard, whose firefighter 
son Christian was killed in the attacks, said today she has been inundated with phone 
calls from concerned family members of victims. She says there's a lot 
of confusion and the families want an update on what investigators know 
so far.

Backing: The Wall Street Journal has dismissed the phone-hacking scandal as a row blown out of proportion by its business competitors and defended News Corp owner Rupert Murdoch, pictured on Monday in London

U.S. authorities have acknowledged they are looking into a report by Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper, which cited an 
unidentified source,

The report has yet to be independently verified but already 
has fuelled U.S. emotions over the wider phone hacking scandal that has 
consumed Britain and rocked Rupert Murdoch's News Corp media empire.

The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, has released a
bulldog defence of its owner Rupert Murdoch and slammed the 
phone-hacking scandal as a row blown out of proportion by its business 
competitors.

Estimates from Barclays Plc and Gabelli & Co suggest
News Corp is still worth $62billion to $79billion when its businesses
are valued separately, even though it is currently a $41billion company on the market.

This shows News Corp is trading at almost a 50 per cent
discount to its units, reported Bloomberg.

Virginia analyst Michael Morris calculated News Corp is worth
around $25 a share, which values it 60 per cent higher than the company’s closing
price last week of $15.64.

‘There’s just sort of this generic Murdoch discount, which
encompasses the concern that he will make decisions that are not consistent
with other shareholder interests,’ he told Bloomberg.

But Mr Murdoch has denied News Corp is all about him, after
saying last week the company is ‘the collective creativity and effort of
many thousands of people around the world’.

America’s end of the embattled News Corp
is reeling from accusations of journalistic malpractice from across the
Atlantic and is desperately trying to distance itself from the News of 
the World.

It follows criticism of the media mogul 
for trying to tame the mounting crisis after he tried to save the BSkyB 
deal, protect News International CEO Rebekah Brooks and close the 
tabloid newspaper.

News Corp’s value crashed 13 per cent 
last week following the closure of the News of the World after reports 
employees had intercepted the voice mail of murdered UK schoolgirl Milly
Dowler.

'We trust that readers can see through the commercial and ideological motives of our competitor-critics,’ a Wall Street Journal editorial said in today’s newspaper as it tried to defend itself.

The editorial criticised The Guardian - referred to as a publication that ‘give(s) Julian Assange and WikiLeaks their moral imprimatur’ - for its ‘lectures about journalistic standards’.

‘They want their readers to believe, based on no evidence, that the tabloid excesses of one publication somehow tarnish thousands of other News Corp journalists across the world,’ it said.

‘Politicians and our competitors are using the phone-hacking years ago at a British corner of News Corp to assail the Journal, and perhaps injure press freedom in general’.

The paper said it was ironic so much moral outrage is being directed at one media company when the British press is known for buying scoops - but claimed it ‘doesn't pay sources for information’.

News Corp’s fiercest critics suggest the company has not been apologetic enough for the scandal, which has now engulfed two of Britain’s top policemen - Sir Paul Stephenson and John Yates.

Former News International chief Rebekah Brooks was backed by Mr Murdoch until last week and was arrested yesterday in London.

‘The shell of invulnerability that Rupert Murdoch had around him has been cracked,’ Boston University professor James Post told the Washington Post. ‘His credibility and the company’s credibility are haemorrhaging.’

News Corp's widely traded Class A 
shares fell 69 cents, or 4.4 per cent, to $14.96 in early afternoon 
trading on Monday.

The shares are down 15.5 per cent since the end of 
June, compared with just 1.7 percent for the S&P 500 index.

Mr Murdoch, 80, and his son, James, 38, are preparing for a UK parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday, when they will be questioned on their roles and responsibilities in the phone hacking scandal.

News Corp’s recent slump has cut more than $6billion off the combined value of the shares that give the Murdoch family control over the company, reported the Washington Post.

Some News Corp directors have suggested Mr Murdoch, company chairman and CEO, is in denial over the fallout from the scandal and does not realise how much it has destroyed what he has built.

His allegations received little traction at the time and they were never properly substantiated.

Resurfacing: Dan Cooper, former Fox News executive, made allegations about a 'Brain Room'

But now suggestions by a former 
executive of Fox News that it had a ‘Brain Room’ in its New York 
headquarters where employees could easily view private telephone records
are re-emerging.

Dan Cooper wrote in 2008 that his own
phone records had been hacked by the TV station and Fox News chief 
Roger Ailes was running a room for counter-intelligence efforts and 
other ‘black ops’.

His
allegations have resurfaced this week after the phone-hacking scandal 
that has dragged the name of News Corporation through the mire and 
caused huge problems for Rupert Murdoch.

‘Most people thought it was simply the research department of Fox News,’ he wrote in a blog post.

‘But
unlike virtually everybody else, because I had to design and build the 
Brain Room, I knew it also housed a counterintelligence and black ops 
office. So accessing phone records was easy pie.’

Just
two months ago his allegations were mentioned by journalist Tim 
Dickenson in Rolling Stone magazine, who said Mr Ailes had created a 
‘brain room’ which required security clearance to get in.

‘People’s faith in the family’s management is diminished,’ media expert Claire Enders told the Washington Post. ‘That too may be very hard to restore quickly.’

Rupert Murdoch had around him has been cracked. His credibility and the 
company’s credibility are haemorrhaging'

A New York Times piece today said News Corp uses ‘blunt force spending to skate past judgment, agreeing to payments to settle legal cases and, undoubtedly more important, silence its critics’.

It added that people are unlikely to see the scandal as ‘an aberrant byproduct of the world of British tabloids’ and ‘the damage is likely to continue to mount’.

It pointed out the company’s liquidity is still looking good, with $11.8billion in cash on hand - but that ‘when you throw money onto a burning fire, it becomes fuel and nothing more’.

News Corp said in April it would settle lawsuits and offer compensation to some public figures who had sued the company, following a phone-hacking lawsuit battle with celebrity publicist Max Clifford.

The Guardian alleged at the time that the company paid him $1.6million to drop his case in 2010.

News Corp has paid more than $600million to settle cases in which it was accused of unfair competition over the last three years, reported the Washington Post.

The company said in February it would pay $125million to Insignia Systems over a case relating to U.S. in-store advertising and $500million to marketing firm Valassis Communications last year.

Earlier this month as the phone-hacking scandal exploded, he abandoned a bid for BSkyB, shut the 168-year-old News of the World and lost the support of all three major political parties in Britain.
