Music and sport came together in unusual fashion on Friday night, as Real Madrid superstar Toni Kroos presented Olly Murs with a Goldene Kamera award in Hamburg. 

Murs, who himself is a big football fan, picked up the Best International Music award in Germany, and was delighted when the accolade was presented to him by a World Cup-winning footballer. 

Kroos is a big Murs fan, and even tweeted in November about the singer's new track 'Wrapped Up'.

The pair smiled, shook hands and linked arms as Murs thanked the crowd for their support and the award

The pair linked arms on stage as Murs gratefully accepted the award - one of the biggest of the night - while the X Factor graduate had also performed earlier with Chic legend Nile Rogers.

Following the ceremony, Murs took to social media to thank 'his mate' Kroos for presenting him the award, with the former Bayern Munich midfielder also having his say, tweeting 'So honoured to present my man @ollymurs the #goldenekamera for Best Music International'.

Kroos will now head back to Madrid, where he and his Los Blancos team-mates face Villarreal on Sunday night.

Following Barcelona's defeat to Malaga last weekend, Carlo Ancelotti's side have opened up a four-point gap on their rivals at the top of La Liga.
