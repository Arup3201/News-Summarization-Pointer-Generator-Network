Christmas shoppers have been flocking to their computers today for Mega Monday bargains as early figures show some stores have seen a 50 per cent increase in trade.

John Lewis said that as of 11am today it was receiving two orders a second online and its total sales was up 55 per cent on the same day last year.

Among the most popular items were tablets, micro scooters and cashmere as shoppers searched for the best deals in time for Christmas.

Marks and Spencer broke its record at lunchtime today for the number of orders received per minute.

Many stores have slashed prices on presents by half and shoppers are expected to spend an astonishing £10,000 a second online.

Web stores are anticipating 115million visits today – up by more than a third on last year – and for shoppers to spend as much as £465million.

The figures will make today the busiest web shopping day of all time.

Marks and Spencer said it received three times as much traffic to its website today than yesterday.

The most popular items were a reduced price Shawl Collar Cosy dressing gown, Festive Cheer Christmas hamper and a Per Una faux fur coat that was reduced from £99 to £79.20.

Dom McBrien, Multi-channel Trading Director at M&S, said  'During the lunch hour window we saw a record number of orders per minute and a threefold increase in traffic compared to yesterday. Customers have been stocking up on Christmas gifts, with hampers and dressing gowns amongst the best selling items.”

Asda Direct also announced this afternoon that its website has seen 20 per cent more traffic today than last year's Mega Monday.

It is the fifth week running the supermarket chain has recorded its highest ever visitor numbers to the site.

A spokesperson said an Acer laptop, HTC Salsa mobile phone and 40 inch Polaroid television have been the most popular items and they expect to sell 20 per cent more units today than last week.

The managing director of Amazon said today could be the busiest day in the website's history. However, official figures have not yet been released.

Christopher North said: 'As people increasingly shop on mobile devices and benefit from fast broadband at home, we're seeing a move towards customers buying their Christmas gifts later in the evening when they are at home relaxing.'

Royal Mail said it is prepared for a significant rise in parcel deliveries and said its research shows more people will buy festive gifts online than ever before.

Nick Landon said: 'Online shopping is now such a key part of the Christmas shopping experience.

'Royal Mail is prepared for this rise in parcels, by opening our eight dedicated parcel sort centres, which will assist our network during our busiest time of the year.'

Experts expect gift hunters to hit the internet in their millions between 9am and 9pm as the Christmas rush bursts into life.

They believe the total value of online shopping in December will top £5billion.

Hourly spending is expected to exceed 
last year’s, with purchases hitting their busiest patch during the lunch
 hour and at 9pm when the day’s chores are done.

Credit card firm Visa said it expected
 its customers would make 6.8million transactions today, up 21 per cent 
on the equivalent day last year.

Tablet computers, such as the iPad Mini and Kindle Fire HD, are among the most searched-for items by web shoppers.

Classic presents such as Barbie and 
Scalextric remain strong, while Lego is the most searched for toy so far
 of 2012, especially Lego Star Wars.

Analysts at consumer information giant
 Experian suggest the number of visits to virtual stores will be up by 
36 per cent on last year. Experts also expect the figures to include a 
ten-fold increase in mobile shopping – on iPhones and other devices – 
today.

At the same time, internet gift purchases are predicted to rise some 15 
per cent to a new high, despite the pressure of the cost of living 
squeeze.

As a result, Royal Mail and other courier companies will be delivering 
around four million purchases a day between now and Christmas Eve.

The rise of the web will be at the expense of the high street as 
traditional bricks and mortar outlets continue to struggle to attract 
customers. All the major online specialists, such as Amazon, eBay, 
Play.com and Pixmania, will be running sale events to tempt shoppers.

Amazon sold more than 3million items and took 35 orders per second on the same Monday last year.

However, it will also be a big day for names such as John Lewis, Marks & Spencer and all the big supermarkets, which are seeing online sales as their fastest growing sectors.

M&S has recruited an additional 800 employees at its distribution centres and doubled the number of employees working in its e-commerce call centre. David Walmsley, multi-channel development director at M&S, said: ‘For months, we’ve been planning behind the scenes to make sure we’re fully prepared to manage the huge uplift in orders we’re expecting.

‘Christmas can be a hectic time for our customers so we’ve brought in extra support in our warehouses, customer services and in stores.’

Some firms have, however, already seen a 
startling rise in sales. John Lewis this weekend reported a record week 
for its online sales, soaring to £37.9million.

James Murray, digital insight manager at Experian, said Christmas 2012 
was on track to be another ‘record-breaker for online retail, 
out-stripping 2011 on all fronts’.

He added: ‘The current market trends suggest that in the UK, Monday 
December 3 will be the biggest pre-Christmas day for online retail, with
 an estimated 115million visits to online retail outlets and a massive 
15million hours spent online shopping on this day alone.’

Experian also expects the next two Mondays to post significantly higher sales than the equivalent dates last year.

British consumers will spend 375million hours shopping online in 
December, 32million more hours than last year, Experian says.Last year 
was a record-breaking year in terms of online retail. Shoppers made 
2.18billion visits to retail websites and spent 343million hours 
shopping online.

And on the same Monday last year 
84.6million visits were made to online sites, with Amazon and eBay 
responsible for 28 per cent of all retail visits.

Britain’s leading parcel and carrier manager Global Freight Solutions 
estimates that December will see four million items being delivered to 
homes and businesses every day.

And ahead of the spending splurge the Royal Mail has opened eight 
dedicated sorting centres to deal with the ‘significant’ increase in 
volume of parcels.

The official customer body, Consumer Focus, has warned shoppers who want
 to make sure items arrive on time to order early to avoid any 
disruption that may come with bad weather.

Research by Which? found that 80 per cent of adults bought at least one 
Christmas present online last year, however one in 12 of their gifts 
failed to arrive on time.
