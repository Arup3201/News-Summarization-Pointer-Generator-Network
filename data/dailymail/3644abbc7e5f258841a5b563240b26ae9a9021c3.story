From Ellie Goulding's lush blonde locks to Louise Thompson's Chelsea girl tresses, many in the world of showbiz have received a helping hand from Kapello hair extensions.

The top-quality Remy specialists are pioneering a pre-taped application method - which essentially involves attaching extensions to your real hair using a strip of, essentially, sticky tape.

Many say this method is, for European hair, trumping micro-rings, weaves and even keratin bonds.

Pre-tapes are said to score higher for a seamless look. They lie flat on the head so there are no lumps or bumps, have a weightless feel, and are easy to apply. It takes just 40 minutes for a whole head.  

I've got lots of hair but it's fine and, thanks to bleaching my whole head for the best part of a year (I'm a sensible ombré now), loads of it is now short and many of the strands are broken.

I was wary of having hair extensions as I have read the horror stories - matting at the roots, the wrong type of glue used, bald patches and head-shaving. 

And I hate the look of clumps of hair that can be created with micro-rings.

But with Kapello I was convinced they were risk-free enough to give them a try.

I was in and out of the salon - hair going from limp and average to full, curly and glamorous - in just an hour.

Pre-taped extensions take just 40 minutes to apply, then just add on some time for washing and styling the hair.

For the application process, there's no stress on the scalp as the tapes are flat and comfortable.

They feature a polyurethane base with integrated hair, and have a polyester film for applying the acrylic base. This makes them transparent, flexible and very resistant.

The film comes off the tape, it's stuck behind the hair, then a double flap comes over to seal the extension. 

Kapello's pre tapes are unique in that they have an indentation in the middle of the tape for clear and precise application - plus curved edges for scalp comfort. They should only ever be applied by a professional.

Once they're in, it's up to you to make sure they stay looking gorgeous. 

The main thing to consider is caring for the hair properly -  don't coat it in shine-sucking sulphates or use the wrong brush, for example (more on aftercare below).

Bradley King, the hair extension technician from Urban Retreat in Harrods, London, who did my hair, is a huge fan of pre-tapes for the speed of application, plus the high quality of the brand's Russian hair.

'I use Kapello pre taped extensions because of how quick they are to apply,' he says.

'Most people lead busy lifestyles and many don't have the time it takes to apply traditional extensions. These extensions are luxurious and soft, I love using the Russian hair for my clients.'

He has said that the best colour combination is when you mix two or even three shades to get a really natural look, and you can create the ombré look very easily by adding a blonde along with your natural colour.

Bradley said he favours a mix of application methods - pre tapes plus a few bonds near the hairline - for the ultimate best result.

I have to say though so far, three weeks in, I wear my hair up and down, straight and curly, and the tapes hardly ever poke through. And not one has fallen out.

Revealing the tapes, they do look garish next to my root colour, but when it's tied up it looks very natural

Ethically sourced, the brand's pre taped extensions are reusable and suitable for all hair types - including very fine hair. 

Kapello won Best Human Hair Extensions in the 2014 Hair Awards, and the brand is taking the industry by storm.

As well as glamorous celebrities it's working women who are buying into the pre tape takeover. 

The luxury hair extensions label have seen a soaring demand for these particular extensions as time-poor women seek out quicker (and cheaper!) extensions solutions.

Make the most of your extensions by taking good care of them

Hair extensions require some maintenance and care. Once you have had them fitted your stylist will guide you through how best to look after your new hair. Extensions are often costly and can take a while to attach, so it's important to look after them properly. Make the most of your extensions by taking good care of them and using the correct products. Correct aftercare is just as important as going to a specialist who can fit the extensions correctly in the first place.

Reduce the amount you wash your hair if you can 

Washing hair too much - more than three times a week - can put too much stress on the extensions due to excessive heat and styling.

Ban sulphate hair products 

It is important to only use a shampoo and conditioner that your stylist says is safe for hair extensions. Many brands contain lots of sodium chloride (salt) which will dry out your hair and silicone based ingredients which can cause some bonds to weaken and break down.

Continue conditioning 

You also need to keep your hair in really good condition by using a moisturising conditioner. However, only condition from the mid lengths to the end of the hair. Do not apply any conditioner to the area where the extensions are attached as this could cause them to weaken.

Take care drying and styling 

The hair is at its weakest when wet so ensure it is dried gently and handled carefully. 

Sleep with it tied in a scrunchie 

Tie your hair back in a loose ponytail or plait using a soft scrunchie for bed so it doesn't get tangled. 

Beware the three month rule

Never wear your extensions for longer than 3 months continuously without maintenance as during this time your hair will have grown by approx 1.5 inches and the roots of your hair will start to tangle. 

Brushing

Remember your extensions are attached to your own natural hair, pulling too hard or mistreating your extensions can result in your own hair being pulled out. The only brush you should use near to your extension bonds is an extension brush with soft loop bristles or a Tangle Teezer. When brushing the extensions always hold the where the extensions are attached making sure no additional stress is put on the hair.
