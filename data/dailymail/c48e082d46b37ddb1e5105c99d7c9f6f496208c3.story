Stephen Starkey, pictured some years ago, died after he was attacked in his own home when he was robbed on Christmas Day morning

A disabled man has died after being attacked by burglars at his home on Christmas Day.

Father-of-four Stephen Starkey, 61, was alone on Christmas morning when he answered the door at 10.30am. He was beaten by a man who made off with a PlayStation 3 games console and some cash.

Derek Wilkinson, 80, a friend and neighbour, said Mr Starkey, pictured below, knocked on his door and told him he’d been attacked. He added: ‘He was in a rough state and had been knocked about. He had bruises on his head and looked very groggy.’

Mr Starkey, who lived alone in his mid-terrace house on an estate in the Greenhill area of Sheffield, managed to walk to the ambulance when paramedics arrived and was taken to hospital.

Mr Wilkinson said his friend had an injured shoulder and bruising on his forehead, but did not seem gravely hurt.

He said: ‘There is no way I thought he was going to die. I rang the hospital and I was told he was in a poorly condition. The next thing I know he has died.’

A 40-year-old man was arrested over the incident last night, while a 37-year-old man has been questioned and bailed.

Neighbours paid tribute to Mr Starkey, a Navy veteran and retired caretaker who had been married three times and had three grown-up daughters and a son.

He was in poor health and disabled and had been targeted previously, having been robbed in a similar raid in October last year. The stolen console was believed to have belonged to Mr Starkey and was not thought to have been a Christmas present. 

Mr Wilkinson described Mr Starkey as a ‘smashing fella’ who will be missed.

His son Todd, who lives in London, came to see him on Boxing Day without realising anything had happened, said Mr Wilkinson.

South Yorkshire Police believe Mr Starkey had been ‘deliberately targeted’.

Earlier this year drug addict John McWilliams, 32, was jailed for 12 months at Sheffield Crown Court for theft and assault after barging into Mr Starkey’s home, pushing him to the floor and stealing £210.

Neighbours said Mr Starkey had been in the Navy at the time of Icelandic Cod Wars in the 1970s. He suffered serious leg injuries in a motorbike accident about 20 years ago which left him with a long-term disability. His family were too upset to speak last night.

The 61-year-old died after being robbed in his home in the Lowedges area of Sheffield on Christmas Day

A spokesman South Yorkshire Police said: 'At around 10.30am on Thursday December 25, a 61-year-old man was inside his home in Reney Crescent, Lowedges, when he answered a knock at his door.

'An unknown man is reported to have entered the property, assaulting the 61-year-old and taking a PlayStation 3 and cash before fleeing the scene.

'The 61-year-old was taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries where he later died. His family have been informed and officers are providing support.'

The police spokesman said a 37-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and is in police custody.

A second man has been arrested in connection with the death of a retired caretaker who was attacked during a robbery at his home on Christmas Day.

The 37-year-old man has been released on bail pending further inquiries, but the 40-year-old second man is being questioned on suspicion of murder.  

Following the assault, as Mr Starkey was still fighting for his life in hospital and before an arrest was made, Detective Inspector Richard Partridge said the assault took place 'on Christmas Day in broad daylight'.

He said: 'We believe that the suspect deliberately targeted this man's house, forcing his way into the property and injuring a vulnerable member of the community before stealing valuables.'

The only sign of the attack at Mr Starkey’s mid-terrace home today was the fingerprinting powder left around his front door (left) by the police (right, at the scene last week)
