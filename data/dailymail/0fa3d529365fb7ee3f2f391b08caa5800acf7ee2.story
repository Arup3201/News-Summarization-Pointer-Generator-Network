Soaring numbers of over-50s are taking in lodgers to beat loneliness and make extra cash.

The number of middle-aged homeowners advertising rooms has increased by 40 per cent over the last two years.

Rental website SpareRoom.co.uk said 32,000 people aged 50 and over took in a lodger in 2011, with the number jumping to nearly 45,000 last year.

These ‘live-in landlords’ can make an average of £466 a month in rent, which can double the income from their State pension, currently worth a maximum of £113.10 a week.

And SpareRoom.co.uk said they can also benefit from the Government’s ‘Rent a Room’ scheme, which can earn landlords up to £4,250 a year tax-free from letting out a furnished room or an entire floor.

Paul Green of Saga, which provides insurance and holidays for the over 50s, said: ‘There are many older people who have spare rooms because their children have left home.

Some people will be doing it for the extra income. For other people, it is nice to have somebody around.’ It also has other perks, such as help to walk or feed pets, he said.

Caroline Abrahams, director of charity Age UK, said: ‘We know rising costs and loneliness and isolation are major issues for many older people, and this helps to explain why there has been such a big increase in older people wanting to rent out rooms in their homes.’

Matt Hutchinson, of SpareRoom.co.uk, added: ‘There is far less stigma around taking in lodgers among the older generation, many of whom grew up in the post-war years when lodging was widespread.’

Adrian Morley, 70, a retired wine importer, lives in a four-bedroom house near Croydon,  South London, and started renting out a self-contained flat in his home two years ago.

He said: ‘After the death of my wife, I decided against downsizing because I didn’t want the hassle of moving plus I have too many happy memories here.

‘The lodgers I’ve had so far have been friendly and reliable, so I’ve been able to take frequent holidays without fear of anything untoward happening.’
