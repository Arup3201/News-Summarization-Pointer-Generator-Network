Four people have been killed today as fighting broke out between rival Libyan rebels.

One rebel group overran the base of another faction in the opposition stronghold of Benghazi after they 
suspected that faction had freed some supporters of Muammar Gaddafi from
an opposition prison, Rebel Information Minister Mahmoud Shammam said.

It comes just days after rebel military chief Abdel-Fattah Younis was killed, possibly by fighters from his own side.

Mr Shammam said the clashes between rebel security forces and members of the 
al-Nidaa Brigade broke out around 3am. Six were also injured in the fighting.

The main rebel force
took control of al-Nidaa's base after five hours of fighting, he said.

The violence comes two days after suspected al-Nidaa members attacked 
two prisons in Benghazi, which led to the escape of some 200 to 300 
inmates, including mercenaries, pro-Gadafi fighters and regime 
loyalists.

The clashes point to divisions
within the rebel ranks that could sap the movement of much-needed unity
in its push to topple Gaddafi nearly six months after the revolt began.

Meanwhile, in the Nafusa mountains of western Libya near the Tunisian border, rebel
forces said they were making gains in their push against Gaddafi 
forces.

On Sunday, they said they were in the town of Hawamid and advanced 
another 6-9 miles toward the small town of Tiji in 
the last 24 hours.

'Hundreds of rebel fighter are surrounding Tiji,' said Jamal Motawa, a 
26-year-old rebel who was one of seven wounded in the fighting. Motawa 
had shrapnel in his left leg.

Pro-Gaddafi forces inside Tiji were under siege but continued to attack the advancing rebels with rockets he said.

Tiji is on the main road from the Tunisian border to Tripoli, the Libyan
capital. It is considered a strategically important town if rebels were
to continue their advance to Tripoli, some 150 miles 
to the northeast.

Rebels in the Nafusa mountains have been making modest advances against 
Gaddafi's troops, but fighting in the east has been stalled for months, 
with neither side able to make any significant progress.

Despite the slow pace of events on the ground, France, one of the rebels' main outside backers, is encouraging patience.

In an interview published on Sunday, French Defence Minister Gerard 
Longuet addressed the growing pressure for a quick resolution to the 
Libya conflict, insisting that 'impatience is never a good adviser' and 
that rebel fighters don't deserve the blame.

'Things have to move in Tripoli. To put it clearly, the population has 
to rise up. The month ahead will naturally be intense. There will not 
be, I think, a pause because of the month of Ramadan,' Longuet said.

Today, a day after NATO airstrikes bombed three Libyan state 
television satellite transmitters in Tripoli, a spokesman at NATO's 
operational headquarters in Naples said the alliance had seen reports of
casualties among the TV network's employees.

A NATO official said: 'We are aware of the allegations related to this subject. We cannot confirm them since we have nobody on the ground
there.'

He noted that the Libyan government had on several past occasions 
claimed that NATO airstrikes had killed civilians, but that most of 
these proved to be false.

Yesterday, the head of Libyan state TV's English-language section told
reporters in Tripoli that three state television journalists were 
killed and 15 other people were wounded in the NATO strikes.

'We are not a military target. We are not commanders in the army and we do not pose a threat to civilians,' Khaled Bazelya said.

The strike on Tripoli's TV transmitters was not NATO's first attack on a
television installation. During the bombing of Serbia in 1999, an 
airstrike on the state-run network's studios in Belgrade killed 16 
employees.

At the time, NATO justified the attack by claiming the TV network was 
fomenting violence and serving as the propaganda mouthpiece of Serbian 
strongman Slobodan Milosevic.

Yesterday, NATO made a similar claim, saying its strike on Libyan TV 
was launched because Gaddafi was using it to 'incite acts of violence.'
