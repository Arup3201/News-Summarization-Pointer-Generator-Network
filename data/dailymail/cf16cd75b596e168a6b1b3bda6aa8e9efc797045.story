A deputy headteacher could be struck off after being accused of ‘chatting up’ a sixth form pupil by asking her if she liked ‘bald older men’ after she said she fancied Hollywood actor Bruce Willis.

A disciplinary hearing yesterday heard that science teacher Alun Rees was ‘creepy’ and that he offered the female pupil private maths tuition – even though it wasn’t his subject.

The 48-year-old drove the girl, known only as pupil A, home after the session and allegedly asked her what kind of men she ‘goes for’.

The General Teaching Council for Wales was told how she replied that she liked Bruce Willis and George Clooney and the teacher said: ‘You like older bald men then?’

Rees is also accused of touching a female pupil in a swimming pool while on a school trip to Barcelona.

The hearing in Cardiff was told that Mr Rees picked up a girl and swung her around in the swimming pool.

Another pupil claims that when they returned from the trip he commented on her tan, asking if it was all over her body.

Mr Rees is also accused of rubbing his foot against a girl's leg while on a school choir trip to Barcelona.

In addition a female colleague has claimed he told her her underwear ‘turned him on’ and then asked if she wanted an affair.

The alleged incidents involving Rees are said to have taken place at the Llantarnum School, pictured in Cwmbran, south Wales

Presenting officer Lousha Bryl told the hearing: ‘One mother said the way Mr Rees looked at her daughter was peculiar, a bit creepy and lechy.

‘She told her daughter to stay away from Mr Rees.’

Mr Rees was working at Llantarnam School in Cwmbran, South Wales, at the time of the alleged incidents and was investigated by the police following the allegations in 2003 before being dismissed from his post.

He denies inappropriate comments, conversations and physical contact with pupils from the 1,400 student school.

He admits making inappropriate comments to English teacher Rachel Gregory but denies unacceptable professional conduct.

The hearing, in Cardiff, continues.
