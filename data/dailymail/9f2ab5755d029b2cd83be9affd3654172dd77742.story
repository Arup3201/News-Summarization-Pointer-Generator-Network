The Queen cut a fashionable figure on day one of Royal Ascot as she appeared in a fondant pink suit - joined by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, but without the Duke of Edinburgh.

The monarch was pictured with a huge smile on her face in the Royal Box as one of the races took place - while Princess Eugenie appeared shocked and Prince Andrew had a face of concentration. 

The Queen also made her traditional appearance on the race track in an open landau carriage pulled by four grey horses, greeted by loud cheers from an adoring crowd of racegoers.

But the bookies weren't smiling so much, having to pay out to punters who guessed the Queen would be wearing pink and those who guessed she would be wearing peach... because they couldn't decide what colour exactly her suit was.

Concentration: Later in the afternoon the Queen was enthralled in a race as she watched from the Royal Box along with Princess Eugenie and Prince Andrew

The Queen couldn't help beaming as her horse appeared to come in first, but maybe Eugenie had betted on a different steed. Sophie, Countess of Wessex is seen right

So in the first punter-friendly 
gesture of the Royal meeting, they paid out in full on bets struck for 
both pink and peach. Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: 'We're not going to
 pick fights with the Palace so if they say it's peach we'll pay on 
peach. But it was pink to our eyes so we'll pay out on pink too!'

The Duchess of Cornwall was her usual 
stylish self in a pretty cream ensemble, while her nieces, Princesses 
Beatrice and Eugenie, both of whom plumped for hats by milliner Nerida 
Fraiman, rode with their father Prince Andrew in a carriage behind.

During her 
grand entrance a military band played the Adele-penned James Bond theme 
Skyfall - a reference to the Monarch's 'skydive' into the Olympic 
Stadium last year.

Princess
 Michael of Kent was spotted in the third carriage, along with Lady 
Helen Taylor and Lord Ivar Mountbatten in the fourth and final carriage.

Elegant:
 The Queen was resplendent in pale fondant pink as she was driven down 
the racecourse in an open landau, accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall

Pretty: Despite being without the Duke of 
Edinburgh, the Queen seemed happy to be at the races and has a horse, a 
filly named Estimate, in the Gold Cup on Thursday

Stylish:
 Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie made an appearance in hats designed by 
Nerida Fraiman and were accompanied their father, the Duke of York

The
 royal party was joined by Serena, Viscountess Linley - the wife of the 
late Princess Margaret's son Andrew - who looked striking in a vibrant 
imperial purple coat dress.

Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, wearing a
 fashion-forward blue ensemble, and her husband Prince Edward, watched the procession from the Royal box.

Although the royal party is never less than elegant, in recent years, Ascot has become a 
less-than-stylish affair with fake tan, bizarre hats and micro minis 
becoming the norm. But two years after imposing strict sartorial rules, 
it seems that Royal Ascot has become a contender in the style stakes 
once more.

Leading the charge was Welsh soprano 
Katherine Jenkins who looked stunning in a sunny bright orange dress and
 matching orange and hot pink fascinator by milliner, Phillip Treacy.

Family affair: The Queen was joined by the 
Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Duke of York
 and his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie

Vibrant: The Queen's niece by marriage, 
Viscountess Serena Linley, looked wonderful in purple, while Princesses 
Beatrice and Eugenie were pretty in black and grey

Enjoying
 the day: The Earl and Countess of Wessex, radiant in petrol blue, 
watched the parade accompanied by friends from the warmth of the Royal 
Box

Mono mania: Along with Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai, both Countess Spencer and Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding plumped for low key black and white combos

Stunning: Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins looked
 wonderful in orange silk and was joined by Bollywood favourite, 
Aishwarya Rai, on day one of Royal Ascot

Lovely: Gary Lineker's wife Danielle was a 
picture in pale pink lace, while Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears 
opted for one of her trademark print dresses

Colourful:
 Guests arriving at day one of this year's Royal Ascot appeared to have 
taken organisers' stern sartorial advice firmly to heart

Striking: Londoner Carrie Colbert and pretty Jackie St Clair (right) wowed fellow racegoers with their stunning floral head wear

Her
 daring choice was echoed by many of her fellow race goers, most of whom
 plumped for bright hues - perhaps to make up for the miserable squalls 
of rain that sent many scurrying for shelter.

'I love Royal Ascot, it's just so fashioned, old-fashioned glamour, old-fashioned traditions,' said the singer, who added: 'I would wear a hat every day if I could.'

Jenkins
 was joined by Earl Spencer and his Canadian wife, Karen, who looked 
beautiful in a low key cream dress and Girls Aloud singer, Sarah 
Harding, who picked a slick black dress teamed with a showstopping gold 
necklace.

Also on hand to get Royal Ascot off to a
 flying start was Bollywood megastar, Aishwarya Rai, who chose a subtle 
monochrome ensemble, topped with a pretty black and white floral hat.

Betting
 on Her Majesty: Bookmakers Coral are offering punters the chance to 
have a flutter on the Queen's sartorial choices, although it seems most 
think blue

Gary Lineker's wife, Danielle, looked particularly beautiful in a stunning pale pink 1930s style frock teamed with a white picture hat, while Andy Murray's other half, Kim Sears, plumped for trademark prints teamed with a pair of delicate lemon shoes.

In the paddock, a flock of beautifully dressed women in a array of stunning rainbow
 hues were drawing admiring glances from male race goers, although the 
odd shivering girl in a too-short skirt could also be seen. Hats were big and bold, with floral 
motifs spotted 
adorning headwear up and down the course.

Racegoer Florence Claridge wore an 
artificial pink fuchsia plant on her head complete with dozens of blooms
 and a matching shocking pink dress. She said: 'You have to be a trooper to wear this, it's quite heavy - but I've been coming here for 25 years.'

Fellow guest, Jackie St Clair chose an enormous pink rose made by milliner Bundle MacLaren. She said: 'It's made from layers of silk and is fabulous. I've been 
coming to Ascot for 31 years. I like the fashion, the Pimm's and the 
quintessential Englishness of it.'

Blooming
 marvellous: Race goer Florence Claridge from Dover looked radiant in a 
gigantic hat inspired by beautiful fuchsia bushes

Crimson classic: The Tootsie Rollers perform on day one of Royal Ascot, dressed in vintage style red dresses teamed with matching fascinators

Cool couples: The wife of Genesis guitarist Mike Rutherford looked fresh and pretty in pale blue while Ruth Langsford (right), wife of Eamonn Holmes, was lovely in lilac

Former Channel 4 racing pundit, John McCririck, was
 on typically bombastic form as he wandered in, trademark bowler hat 
and cigar firmly in place.

Like fellow female guests, McCririck 
embraced the floral theme, courtesy of a huge cabbage rose in his 
buttonhole, although his wife, in a pretty pansy print dress, had the 
edge in the style stakes.

Also looking good was Ruth Langsford, wife of veteran Sky News presenter, Eamonn Holmes, who looked radiant in a pretty lilac dress and cream picture hat.

Nearby, Ascot's phalanx of dress code
 enforcers - tasked with ensuring straps are at least 2.5 inches wide 
and skirts are modest - watched beadily, while surveying passing guests.

And not everyone made the cut. One unfortunate racegoer - a gentleman sporting a large floral headpiece - fell foul of the Royal Ascot fashion police and was sent home to change.

Although today's races will not feature a thoroughbred from the Queen's own stables, her filly, Estimate, is one of the favourites for Thursday's Gold Cup -  a race the Queen would dearly love to win.

In the foreword to the official programme, the Queen wrote: 'I was fortunate enough too own a winner at last year's royal meeting, so I know what a thrill it is to have success at this wonderful racecourse whether you are a trainer, jockey, or one of the many hard-working stable staff associated with every runner.'

Also in the running for the Gold Cup is last year's winner, Colour Vision, and 2010 champion, Rites of Passage.

Today's races include the Queen Anne Stakes, expected to be carried off by American horse, Animal Kingdom, followed by the King's Stand Stakes, which will see South African colt, Shea Shea, start the race in pole position with bookmakers.

Glamorous: This lady was one of the few to buck the trend for colossal blooms, instead choosing a delicate gold creation trimmed with ostrich feathers

Cheerful:
 It takes more than a drop of rain to make veteran racing pundit, John 
McCririck, lose his good humour - just ask former employer Channel 4

Opulent: Racegoer, Anneka Tanaka-Svenska, sports big pink blooms combined with ropes of pearls on her  utterly spectacular hat
