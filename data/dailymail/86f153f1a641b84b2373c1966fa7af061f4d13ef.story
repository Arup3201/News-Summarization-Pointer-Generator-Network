The way you use Facebook and Twitter could mirror how narcissistic you are, according to a new university study.

Research by the University of Michigan examined how social media websites reflect a growing culture of narcissism in the US.

Scientists found that middle-aged narcissists are more likely to frequently update their Facebook status, while their younger counterparts take to Twitter to satisfy their vanity.

According to Elliot Panek, who was one of three scientists behind the research, middle-aged people use Facebook as a way of gaining approval of their image from their peers, while college students prefer Twitter because they over-value their own opinions.

He said of middle-aged Facebook users: 'It's about curating your own image, how you are seen and also checking on how others respond to this image.

'Middle-aged adults usually have already formed their social selves, and they use social media to gain approval from those who are already in their social circles.'

According to the study, Twitter acts as a megaphone for younger web users.

Mr Panek said: 'Through Twitter they're trying to broaden their social circles and broadcast their views about a wide range of topics and issues.'

For part of the study, which looked at whether narcissism was related to how long we spend on Facebook and twitter each day, researchers looked at the social media activity of 486 college undergraduates.

Participants, with an average age of 19, took a personality assessment measuring types of narcissism including exhibitionism, self-sufficiency and authority as well as charting their social media use.

According to Science Daily, a second group of 93 adults with an average age of 35 also had to complete an online survey.

The results showed that college students and their adult counterparts use social media in different ways to boost their self-esteem.

The researchers however, could not tell whether narcissism leads to an increase in social media use or vice versa.
