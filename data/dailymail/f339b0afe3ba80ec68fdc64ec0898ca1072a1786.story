Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri has admitted that sometime he can be more than a little bit difficult to be around.

The 27-year-old has received criticism from his former manager at the Etihad, Roberto Mancini, who said the Frenchman didn't work as hard as he should do. 

Nasri was also embroiled in a spat with France national coach Didier Deschamps after he was left out of the squad to travel to Brazil for the World Cup last summer.

The 27-year-old Frenchman said he used to keep quiet when he was younger but now he says what he thinks

The row ended with his girlfriend hurling abuse at Deschamps on Twitter and Nasri announcing his retirement from international football.

'From time to time, I'm a jerk,' Nasri said in an interview with L'Equipe 21.

'Sometimes it is better to buckle but it is something I can't do.

'I managed when I was younger and sometimes I went home with a knot in my stomach. Afterwards, you go off, but not with the right person.

'I'd therefore prefer to say everything I think, even if it means I'm not liked, even if it means I sound arrogant and a little prick. At least the folk I do like don't have to suffer.'
