At least 20 government fighters and militia have been killed in an attack by Syrian rebels, after they tunnelled under an army position and detonated an underground bomb.

The explosion took place in the historic old city of Aleppo, an area which has seen horrific violence ever since a major rebel offensive in July 2012.

A powerful rebel alliance called the 
Islamic Front claimed responsibility for the tunnel blast on Saturday and tweeted a video of the explosion.

At least 20 government fighters and militia have been killed in an 
apparent attack by Syrian rebels after a tunnel bomb was exploded near 
the historic old city of Aleppo

A powerful rebel alliance, called the Islamic Front, claimed 
responsibility for the tunnel blast and tweeted a video of the 
explosion, which it claimed had killed at least 40 pro-government 
soldiers

The video shows a massive blast erupting from a skyline of rooftops, 
before debris is thrown into the air in a huge cloud of dust. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 20 people were killed

 blast erupting from a skyline of rooftops and satellite dishes near the Zahrawi market, 
throwing chunks of brick and a huge cloud of dust into the air.

The blast came just one day after an air strike was carried out in the Bustan al-Qasr rebel-held neighbourhood in Aleppo, which left dozens killed.

The Britain-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights activist group said around 2,000 people - a quarter of them children - have been killed since January in 
regime bombings of the city and its nearby towns and 
villages.

The Observatory also said fighting took place after the blast - which the Islamic Front claimed had killed 40 people. 

It said: 'Islamist rebels detonated a tunnel near 
the Zahrawi market in the Old City of Aleppo, killing at least 20 army 
soldiers and pro-regime militiamen.'

In recent weeks, the Islamic Front has 
claimed several times that it has used tunnels to plant massive amounts 
of explosives beneath army positions.

 been killed in regime bombing in Aleppo and the surrounding towns since
 January

Syrians were seen carrying bodies away from the streets after the airstrike, which was followed by the tunnel explosion less than 24 hours later near the Zahrawi market, 
not far from the citadel in Old Aleppo

Emergency workers worked to help those who have been injured in the air 
strike. The area sees daily fighting and the army has set up multiple 
positions there

In early May, rebels also used bomb-packed tunnels to level a historic hotel in the Old City of Aleppo that was being used as an army base.

It is a flashpoint area that sees daily fighting, and the army has set up multiple positions there.

Such explosions have provided a reminder that the rebels, despite setbacks in other parts of the country, remain a potent force.

Now in its fourth year, Syria's conflict has killed more than 160,000 people and caused a humanitarian crisis.

After the air strike, residents removed bodies from the street and put 
them inside a pick-up truck, pictured above, where they were taken off 
to be cared for

Now in its fourth year, Syria's conflict has caused a humanitarian 
crisis, killing more than 160,000 people. The United Nations said around
 9.3million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance inside 
Syria

The United Nations has said that some 9.3 million people - more than 6.5 million displaced by the fighting - are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance inside Syria.

A UN spokeswoman said on Friday that a 15-truck convoy delivered food aid to Syrian Arab Red Crescent warehouses for 30,000 people in rebel-held areas in western parts of the Aleppo governorate.

Stephane Dujarric said the convoy also carried in medicine for 15,000 people, and household items for another 10,000.

Humanitarian aid has not been able to reach many areas where people are in need, despite a UN Security Council resolution in February demanding unfettered access.

Now, Australia, Luxembourg and Jordan are planning to circulate a new UN Security Council resolution that diplomats say would authorise the delivery of humanitarian aid into Syria through four border crossings, without approval from president Bashar Assad's government.

Currently, all UN aid must go through Damascus - a practice which has been repeatedly criticised.
