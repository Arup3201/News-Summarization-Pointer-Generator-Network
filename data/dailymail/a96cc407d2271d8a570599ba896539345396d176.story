A pregnant prosecutor who was a rising star at the Delaware Attorney General's Office has died suddenly - along with her unborn daughter.

Sarita Wright Lucas, 33, passed away unexpectedly in her Elkton, Delaware home around 7pm on Sunday after her husband discovered her in distress and called 911.

The call indicated she had suffered cardiac arrest, Lieutenant Michael Holmes with the Cecil County Sheriff's Office told the Star Democrat, but an investigation into the cause of her death is underway.

'There were no signs of trauma and there were no signs of foul play,' Holmes said.

Loved: Sarita Wright Lucas, 33, passed away suddenly on Sunday and investigations are underway to determine her cause of death. The prosecutor was six months pregnant when she died

No final cause of death has yet been given and she had no major issues in her medical history.

Wright was six months pregnant and her daughter, whom she and her husband had planned to name Claire, also passed away. 

She had worked as a deputy attorney general in the Delaware Attorney General's Office since August 2008.

Colleagues, who had spoken to her just hours when she pulled out of a Sunday meeting because she was tired, expressed their heartbreak over her sudden death.

In a statement, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden called her 'incredibly committed and accomplished'.

'Her passing is a shock to us all,' he wrote. 'As we deeply mourn her passing our hearts and prayers go out to her husband Tony and to her entire family.'

Left behind: Husband Tony, a University of Delaware football coach, called 911 when he found her in distress

Loved: Mr Lucas said he doesn't think he'll ever come to terms with the loss of his partner of 15 years

Tony Lucas, an assistant football coach at the University of Delaware, went to work on Tuesday, where he was greeted with hugs and handshakes from well wishes, Delaware Online reported.

'Right now I need normal,' he said. 'I'm good in spurts and then as I reflect on it, it hits me again. I don't think I'll ever come to terms with it. I don't think I ever can.'

The couple met 15 years ago when Lucas was a student at Columbia University in New York and Wright attended Barnard College nearby. They were married in 2012.   

'Her heart was just so big,' he said. 'She'd go out of her way to help somebody else out regardless of what it meant to her own issues or her own work. She'd be the shoulder to cry on, she'd be the swift kick in the butt that you need.' 

Wright Lucas, who was from Boston, started working with the Delaware Attorney General's Office in June 2007 as a summer law clerk and was hired in August 2008. 

Devoted: Lucas Wright had been working for the Delaware Attorney General's Office since 2008 and colleagues described her as a tenacious prosecutor who was devoted to keeping the bad guys off the streets

Delaware Online noted that she quickly proved herself in court and rose through the ranks to became the youngest unit leader in the office. She took Wilmington, determined to keep the bad guys off the streets.

Colleagues recalled how she would be the first person in the office and the last to leave at night, often wearing her Boston Red Sox cap.

'She was an essential part of the prosecution team and the fabric of our office,' said Deputy Attorney General Steve Wood. 'We loved her. Her potential was unlimited.'

'To say it is devastating is an understatement,' added David Baylor, Delaware City Chief of Police.  

Services for Wright Lucas will be held on Saturday morning in Milton, Massachusetts at the Alfred P. Thomas Funeral Home.
