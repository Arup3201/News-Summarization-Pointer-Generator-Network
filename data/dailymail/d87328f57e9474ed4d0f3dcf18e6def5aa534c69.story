Michelle Obama, making her third appearance on Jay Leno this evening,  teases America's superstar gymnast and Olympic gold medalist, Gabby Douglas for eating fast food.

While sitting next to the first lady in awe, the 16-year-old admits to Mr Leno her only gold medal celebration was 'splurging on a McDonald's Egg Mcmuffin.'

The first lady, an advocate of healthy eating, quickly, but jokingly, scolds the gymnast for her celebratory meal choice, saying: 'Yea, Gabby, don't encourage that! But I'm sure it was on a whole wheat muffin'.

Mrs Obama adds: 'You're setting me back, Gabby,' which draws a big smile and a 'Sorry!' from the young athlete, clad in a leather jacket and gold miniskirt.

During the just-ended London Olympics, the teen gymnast became the third straight U.S. athlete and first African-American to win the all-around title.

But after the first lady banned Barack Obama from eating deep friend Twinkies earlier today, her teasing reaction to Gabby's fast food comment doesn't come as a surprise.

President Obama, in Council Bluffs this morning, said he would end his day with a previously unannounced stop at the Iowa State Fair, before admitting: 'Michelle has told me I can’t have a fried Twinkie. But... I understand this year there’s a chocolate moose. So I’m going to have to take a look at that, if I can'.

The first lady, dressed in a summery yellow digital printed dress, also reveals the real story behind her Kiss Cam moment with her husband at last month's basketball game between Team USA and Brazil, before discussing her proudest first term moment.

Mr Leno teases the first lady, accusing her of turning the president down on the game's Kiss Cam during the first half.

'I did not!' Mrs Obama exclaims. 'The girls and I had been somewhere else, we met him at the game, and I had just walked in and sat down and I see my face on the jumbotron and I'm still a little embarrassed.

'I didn't see the Kiss Cam part so I 
didn't know we were supposed to kiss! And then Malia came over after we 
got booed for not kissing and she was just disgusted with us.

'She said "Why didn't you kiss!" And I was like, "What are you talking about!"

The President then raised a cheer however when he kissed his wife during an interval in the fourth quarter.

The Kiss Cam spotlighted the couple for the second time, and the President was ready; he planted a big kiss on the first lady as the crowd roared.

The first lady, who appears on the Late Show following her 
two-day fundraising swing through Los Angeles, and a day after she chatted up campaign 
contributors at the home of singer Gwen Stefani, also discusses her proudest moment of her husband's first term.

She says: 'There's so much, but truly, health reform - something that that hasn't been accomplished by a sitting president in a century.

'One of the things that struck me', she continues, 'I was on the plane [with my team] when the supreme court's answer came down... and the young kids, 25 or so, they breathed a sign of relief. I didn't realize, but several of them had pre-exsisting health conditions.

'They had been worried what would happen...whether they could ever get health care. And that's no longer a problem for Americans.'
