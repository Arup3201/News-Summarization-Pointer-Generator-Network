Stoke City are back in discussions over an ambitious deal for Andriy Yarmolenko.

The Ukraine winger is available for around £8million plus add-ons but his wages of £75,000 a week are an obstacle.

Yarmolenko scored four goals in seven games for Dynamo Kiev in the Europa League last season.

Loan ranger: Oussama Assaidi impressed at Stoke last season but the Potters aren't keen on permanent deal

Elsewhere, Stoke have gone cool on Liverpool's Oussama Assaidi but have expressed an interest in Parma's Jonathan Biabiany as have West Brom and Southampton.

Assaidi netted five times in 25 games on loan at the Britannia last season. However, the Potters have decided to look elsewhere.

Meanwhile, Albion have joined Crystal Palace by expressing interest in Stoke City striker Jonathan Walters.
