Click here to read: Strictly speaking, we are looking in the wrong place for racism

'Is it any wonder that, in this climate, Ramires of Chelsea believes he heard a white referee, Mark Clattenburg, refer to his black team-mate John Mikel Obi as a ‘monkey’ two weeks ago'

Tottenham have issued an impassioned defence of their fans’ right to use the term ‘Yid’ in their matchday chants.

Peter Herbert, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, described the north London club’s attitude as being ‘40 years out of date’, and said that if such chants continue they would ask the police to bring a prosecution for racism.

The society claim such chants — either by opposition fans or Spurs supporters themselves — are anti-Semitic and unacceptable in contemporary society.

As part of a 10-point plan to tackle racism in football, they are threatening to report to the police any anti-Semitic chants heard at White Hart Lane unless Tottenham and the FA agree to take action.Spurs are steeped in Jewish tradition and large sections of their support refer to themselves as ‘Yids’ in matchday songs.

 'The club does not tolerate any form of racist or abusive chanting.

'Our guiding principle in respect of 
the "Y-word" is based on the point of law itself - the distinguishing 
factor is the intent with which it is used ie if it is used with the 
deliberate intention to cause offence.

'This has been the basis of 
prosecutions of fans of other teams to date. Our fans adopted the chant 
as a defence mechanism in order to own the term and thereby deflect 
anti-Semitic abuse. They do not use the term to others to cause any 
offence, they use it a chant amongst themselves.

'The club believes that real 
anti-semitic abuse such as hissing to simulate the noise of gas chambers
is the real evil and the real offence. We believe this is the area that
requires a determined and concerted effort from all parties and where 
we seek greater support to eradicate.'

Herbert also says that ‘hissing’ 
noises made by away fans at White Hart Lane — a reference to the gas 
chambers in the Holocaust — are equally intolerable and will also 
provoke a complaint from his organisation.

Herbert told Sportsmail: 'In discussions with members of the 
Jewish community, we were made aware that this practice is still 
continuing and it has to come to an end.

'If
neither Tottenham FC nor the FA are willing to take a stand then SBL 
will report the matter to the Metropolitan Police Service for 
investigation and, if necessary, prosecution.

'The
report will be made if this behaviour does not cease by 20 November. We
will have monitors in attendance to observe what occurs.'

But Tottenham hit back with a strong 
defence of their supporters’ use of the word ‘Yid’, saying in a 
statement: ‘The club does not tolerate any form of racist or abusive 
chanting.

'Our guiding principle in respect of 
the “Y-word” is based on the point of law itself — the distinguishing 
factor is the intent with which it is used, ie. if it is used with the 
deliberate intention to cause offence.

Peter Herbert is a human rights barrister and chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers. He’s also the man who lodged a complaint with the Metropolitan Police over referee Mark Clattenburg’s alleged abuse of John Mikel Obi.Herbert was the first chair of the Race-Hate Crimes Forum and, with strong links to the US, has advised on introducing an equivalent to the Rooney Rule in Britain.

After reading Tottenham’s statement, Herbert made a stinging attack on the club, branding the comments ‘unbelievable’.

‘The argument sounds like it is 40 
years old,’ he said. ‘I’m deeply saddened that a football club that 
represents such a diverse area has taken such a view. I don’t want to 
have to take my children to a football match and expect to hear 
anti-Semitic chants. 

‘Tottenham Hotspur Football Club 
obviously just don’t get it. It’s almost like saying if a woman refers 
to another woman in a derogatory fashion then it is OK.’

Herbert added: ‘What we are trying to
do is change a culture. What we are saying to Tottenham is, “Maybe this
was OK 50 years ago — but it isn’t now”.

‘Even if it comes from Tottenham 
supporters, it remains casual racism. We understand it is a difficult, 
and for some an uncomfortable, stance to take, but we feel it is the 
right stance.’

Former Spurs stars Gary Lineker and Ledley King have previously condemned the mimicking of the gas chambers by away supporters.

Tottenham have traditionally been 
well supported by members of the Jewish community. Many fans do not 
consider references to their faith as offensive. Others,such as comedian
David Baddiel, however, do.

Last year Baddiel
launched a campaign, supported by Lineker, to stamp out use of the word 'yid' in football 
chants which mock Jewish and Tottenham supporters.

The Society of Black Lawyers is involved in talks to create a Black Players’ Association 
with some professionals, claiming the football authorities are not doing
enough to represent them or to tackle racism in the sport.

The PFA recently introduced its own six-point action plan but the society says this will prove 'ineffective'.

Spurs supporters will be put under the microscope more than ever during the Europa League visit of Maribor.

But Tottenham manager Andre 
Villas-Boas is focusing on whether to field a double-pronged strikeforce
of Jermain Defoe and Emmanuel Adebayor against the Slovenian champions.

England striker Defoe has been 
Tottenham’s No 1 striker this season, while Adebayor has been forced to 
spend most of the season on the bench.

Villas-Boas said: ‘We have had thoughts, between the technical staff, about playing them both — about changing our structure. 

‘We have had success in the past with
the system that we are playing. We certainly have played 4-4-2 in some 
games when Ade has come on. But whether the right time is tomorrow I am 
not sure.’

As a youngster growing up supporting Spurs, it took me some time to realise the word 'yid' was an offensive racial slur. I'd never heard it used in a derogatory sense at White Hart Lane, only ever as a collective term - yid army - and as a positive identifier.

If a player was good, he was a yiddo.

But its significance soon became apparent. Though far from the abhorrent gas chamber hissing of some away fans, it's still sensitive. Context is important, though, and its reclamation as a positive term at the ground should not be ignored.

The Society of Black lawyers says use of the word yid, including the tone adopted by Spurs fans, amounts to casual racism. Perhaps they have a point. Perhaps simply substituting the word would be the answer. But Spurs fans are unlikely to take kindly at being told what to do by an external body, especially as it is largely considered a positive, rather than offensive, chant.

David Baddiel tried to stamp out its use by Tottenham supporters but, despite his own Jewish faith, the views of a Chelsea fan were never likely to be accepted by the Spurs majority.

If the word yid really is to be kicked out of White Hart Lane, it would need concerns to be raised from within the Spurs-supporting community, rather than outside pressures.
