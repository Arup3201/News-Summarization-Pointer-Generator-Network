Bruce Jenner could be financially destroyed if the relatives of the 69-year-old woman who died in a four-car horror crash involving his SUV earlier this month decide to sue him, it has been claimed.

The Olympic gold medalist only had insurance coverage up to $250,000 when he allegedly rear-ended Kim Howe's Lexus on a California highway, according to a source close to the investigation.

This means he may be left in a precarious position if Ms Howe's family chooses to file a civil lawsuit against him. In such a case, 'the sky's the limit with what a jury could award,' one attorney said.

However it has been claimed that Jenner, who stars in reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, is unlikely to face charges over the fatal crash. 

Jenner is still incredibly wealthy after divorcing from his wife, Kris, with whom he shared an estimated $125million fortune.

Crash scene: Bruce Jenner could be financially destroyed if the relatives of the 69-year-old woman who died in a four-car horror crash involving his SUV earlier this month decide to sue him, it has been claimed.

But if he is hit by a civil lawsuit relating to the crash on February 7, he could face losing  millions of dollars - and may even experience financial ruin due to his 'low' insurance coverage, it is claimed.

'It’s absolutely crazy that someone who has his kind of money would risk everything by not having higher rates of protection,' the unnamed source close to the investigation told RadarOnline.

Last week, California-based criminal defense attorney, R.J. Manuelian, said that criminal charges are unlikely to be filed against Jenner following the fatal crash on Malibu's Pacific Coast Highway.

If they are, the 65-year-old will avoid prison and likely be granted probation, he told Fox 411.

But he added: 'However, Jenner's biggest worry should be the wrongful death lawsuit, which will be filed soon enough, and will reach deep into his pockets if his insurance doesn't cover his tab.'

Police sources told TMZ that because Jenner had not been drinking, texting or speeding when the crash happened he was unlikely to face charges. 

Speaking to People magazine, James Fox, an attorney who specializes in motor vehicle crashes, agreed that Jenner could suffer a huge financial blow if Ms Howe's relatives file a civil suit.

Victim: This means he may be left in a precarious position if Ms Howe's (pictured) family chooses to file a civil lawsuit against him. In such a case, 'the sky's the limit with what a jury could award,' one attorney said

If he were found liable, 'the sky's the limit with what a jury could award,' said Mr Fox, adding that the state's 'comparative fault' law means that fault can be apportioned among many parties by a court.

It comes as it has been reported that data from the Sensing Diagnostic Module in Jenner's car showed he was driving between 46 and 47mph when he slammed on the brakes, according to TMZ.

The impact happened soon after, when the vehicle was travelling at 38mph, a source reportedly told the website.

A police source has claimed that surveillance footage taken by cameras on a nearby MTA bus and shows that Jenner started the chain-reaction crash that killed Ms Howe.

Jenner was hauling an off-road vehicle on a trailer behind his Cadillac Escalade when he steered to avoid cars slowing for a traffic light in front of him on the highway, the unnamed official said.

The star's SUV then allegedly rear-ended two cars, including a Toyota Prius, propelling Ms Howe's white Lexus into oncoming traffic.The widow was struck head-on by a Hummer H2 and killed.

The source's revelations contradicted officials' initial claims that the victim's Lexus had struck the Prius. Before her death, Ms Howe lived alone in a $2.5million house in Calabasas, Los Angeles.

The official briefed on the video  spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Jenner is recently said to have told officers there was no way he could have avoided the collision because the driver in front of him slammed on the brakes. He also vowed to cooperate with police. 

In a statement, he said: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident.

'It is a devastating tragedy and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.'

The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is still investigating the cause of the wreck and will consider whether to issue a citation that could result in criminal charges - possibly vehicular manslaughter.

However, an anonymous LAPD homicide detective has agreed with Manuelian that criminal manslaughter charges against the former Olympic track runner would likely 'be a stretch'.

'It would have to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was negligent,' said the source. 

'Just because he rear-ended someone, its usually considered an accident. But, the stretch would be that he was inattentive and violated the vehicle code of following too close.'

If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, they could face up to six years in prison. Five children and two adults were also hospitalized in the fatal collision earlier this month.

Officials have said there is no evidence that Jenner was being chased by paparazzi at the time. 

It comes just days after Jenner's stepdaughter, Khloe Kardashian,  spun off the road and ended up in a ditch while her sisters Kim and Kylie Jenner and Kim's baby North West were in the car.

Khloe was behind the wheel of a black Yukon GMC in Bozeman, Montana, with her siblings and Kim's daughter on Saturday when she hit a patch of black ice, swerved and ended up in a ditch. 

In the aftermath Kim took to social media to thank God for watching over her family and keeping them safe as they all escaped without injury. Their publicist confirmed they are 'OK'. 

It is not known exactly how much Jenner is worth in the wake of his divorce from his wife, Kris.

An investigation into the crash involving him is ongoing.
