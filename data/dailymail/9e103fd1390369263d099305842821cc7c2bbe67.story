Shrien Dewani is a narcissist whose body language in the days before his wife's honeymoon murder revealed 'deep tensions' in their relationship, an expert claimed today.

Analysing CCTV footage shown at his murder trial, Dr Denise Bjorkman claims the pair appeared extremely uncomfortable in each other's company - from forced embraces to scenes where a 'decidedly unhappy' Anni Dewani trails behind her 'uncaring' new husband.

'The bottom line,' she claims. 'Is that he was not in love with her.' 

Her comments come a day after it emerged his lawyers said they would apply for all charges against him to be dropped following a succession of prosecution lines collapsing.

Judge Jeanette Traverso may rule next week on whether the 34-year-old businessman has a case to answer about his alleged role in the plot to kidnap and murder his wife.

Dr Bjorkman, a behavioural psychologist, also accuses the British businessman of reacting to news of his bride's death with an 'awkward' response.

Here, she gives MailOnline a running commentary of the couple's demeanour during Anni's final hours and Dewani's behaviour in the days after she was gunned down.

'FORCED ROMANCE' 

In the picture of Anni clinging to her Shrien in the car park, there is a possible scene of hope, expectations and desire for consummation and a love for which she yearned.  

But the picture also shows ambiguity on her side. 

She walks separately from him: note the distance of her legs from his, but her upper body leans reluctantly and awkwardly towards him.

It is more likely he is pulling her towards him with some degree of force. This is reinforced where he pulls her by the neck for a kiss. 

This motion can be classified as an act of authority: Lovers don't yank their partner's necks. It looks as if there is Iack of emotional commitment on his side.  

Anni's final hours: Shrien Dewani strides ahead, hands in pockets, towards the Surfside seafood restaurant, in Strand - an unfashionable seaside town in Cape Town - leaving his new bride trailing behind shortly before she was gunned down on their honeymoon in a carjacking allegedly staged by her husband

Last moments: The awkward body language between the couple is clear even in the grainy CCTV footage as Mrs Dewani walks several metres behind her new husband with her arms folded

The couple make their way towards Zola Tongo's taxi before the fateful journey where she was shot dead by two gunmen in what the prosecution claim was a hit orchestrated by her husband. Mrs Dewani is wearing the short dress and high heels that she was found in the following morning in the back of the abandoned car

'FROSTY RELATIONS' 

The loving clip in the street was the night before her death. 

The evening of their outing which led to her death shows a decidedly unhappy Anni trailing behind a purposeful Dewani who strides uncaringly ahead of her.  

This is very much a picture of an unwilling partner.

In one scene, Dewani can be seen kissing Anni but we already know he is aware of the cameras and looks upward to confirm camera position in another frame.  

He almost throws her off balance and he can be seen to be thrusting his lips on her averted face.

She avoids making lip-to-lip contact which is a very significant message from a woman on her honeymoon.  

The deep tensions in their relationship are clear. 

The bottom line, he was not in love with her as there was no consistency in his behaviour towards her which shows passion, sexual intimacy, emotional need. 

In  CCTV footage shown at the murder trial, Dewani is shown being led down the corridor to his hotel room with an arm around his shoulder while he holds his head in his hands, apparently in grief

As he arrives at the room door, Dewani appears to take one hand from his face and reach into his pocket

Dewani then brings his other hand to his pocket, then appears to hand the room key to his companion and walks with him into the room with hands in pockets

'AWKWARD GRIEF?'

In the hotel corridor where he receives the news of Anni's death, he seems awkward in his response and his body movements seem timed and conscious.

When someone receives bad news a normal response is a gasp for air. 

The mouth falls open with a primitive shock reaction, an adjustment of the reptilian brain.

His finely gym-toned body appears to be the only real tension on display. Bicep tension and size does not require effort. 

The human response to bad news is almost foetal with the body musculature collapsing in on itself as energy drains.   

A day after he is seen relaxed and smiling in the same corridor. 

Caught on CCTV: In one video clip shown to the courtroom, Dewani is captured leading alleged fixer Tongo down a hotel corridor to a quiet room, carrying a small bag

Evidence: The opening shot of the surveillance camera sequence shown to the South African court shows suspect Shrien Dewani walking through the foyer of the Cape Grace hotel days after his new wife's murder 

Waiting: Dewani is seen pacing back and forth in the hotel lobby in the moments before Tongo appears

'GRIPPING ENCOUNTER' 

In the hotel lounge frame where Dewani is seen carrying a packet, his shoulders are hunched forward in an expectant position, suggesting purpose in his movement. 

By contrast his grip of the handle of the packet is tight indicating that it has value and cannot be lost. 

In body language parlance, this is called field dependence - hinting at gravitas being attached to something external. 

His explanation of a tip (for the taxi driver) in a bag is unusual. Tips are not traditionally given in bags. 

The norm is to hand over notes either opened or in a folded wad.

Suspicions: Dewani is in a corridor of the hotel, checking his phone and clutching a white carrier bag

Retail therapy: The bag is from a shopping trip to the nearby V&A Waterfront. The Western Cape Court heard Dewani chose to shop for greetings cards instead of attending a Hindu ceremony to bless his wife's body

SHOPPING SPREE 

The retail therapy pic shows anything but grief. 

His body style is relaxed and confident.

This is the real Dewani.

'NARCISSISM DOES OUT'

Early footage of the good-looking Dewani shows his preoccupation with his image projection and he walks with the confident glide of a fashion model for GQ. 

There is an enduring trend of dapper dressing, sleek tailored attire and labels. 

His clothing fits his lean body suggesting that shopping is more than an outing. It is an experience.

Soft boyish features and sensuous lips contrasted against a muscular well-toned body complete the picture.

British courts are defined by respectful behaviour and dignified dress, the latter idea of which seems to have eluded Dewani as he arrives for extradition court hearings looking unkempt, eyes cast down, feet shod in trainers, dragging on the ground. 

Unpressed jeans or track suit pants are de rigeur as is his unshaven face and bomber jackets. 

This look fits appropriately into the depressed post-traumatic stress image he projected.

But narcissism does out through the contrasting designer hairstyle and well-manicured slim hands.

ATTENTION TO DETAIL 

In the court room we see his unfailing attention to detail and his image with his sartorial elegance.

His suit, shirt and tie are immaculate as is his designer hairstyle. 

Only the frightened, wide alertness of his eyes as they dart with involuntary speed around the court to take in as much information as possible is the giveaway.

His breathing is shallow supporting the element of fear. 

Salacious information of his other life (with gay prostitutes) confirms his ability to project an image on command. 

He probably has endured a lifetime of living this double life so changing face chameleon style is not alien to him.
