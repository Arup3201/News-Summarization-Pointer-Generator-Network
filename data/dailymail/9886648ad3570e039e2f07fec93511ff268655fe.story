Four Georgia teens allegedly stole a goat so one boy could allegedly use it in a prom proposal

Three teens were busted for the theft along with a fourth unidentified 16-year-old who'll face juvenile charges

The homeowner confronted the boys, telling cops that 'the males looked like they had something large in their hands that they were loading into one of the trucks,' The Smoking Gun reports.

Police later stopped a vehicle matching the description given by the homeowner, finding a goat inside.

My Fox Atlanta reports the goat, named Chip, was the property of the homeowner's neighbor.

Jacob Michels, 17, told police he wanted the animal 'because he thought he would ask a girl to the prom by saying, ‘Would you goat with me to prom?’'

The boys were spotted by a neighbor across the street as the made off with the goat

Michels was handcuffed along with fellow 17-year-olds Walker Boston and Brendan Lawle

A fourth teen, 16, was not identified as he faces juvenile charges. 

'Well, you know, it's quite possible that these teens didn't realize the severity of what they were doing,' Milton Police Captain Shawn McCarty told reporters. 'Apparently, this was supposed to be a prank.'
