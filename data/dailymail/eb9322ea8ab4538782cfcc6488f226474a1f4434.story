The Royal Navy has revealed its latest 3D radar system which can track missiles - before knocking them out of the sky.

The cutting-edge system, called 'Artisan', was tested by some 180 sailors on board HMS Iron Duke off the coast of Portland today.

It tracked a sea-skimming target, before launching a Seawolf missile - which crashed into the object seconds later.

The dramatic moment, caught on camera by crew members, was the first time the system had been used to track a moving target ahead of a missile launch.

And it has been deemed a success - with experts saying the 'Artisan' system could be used by the Navy in the future to counter any threats in the skies.

'I’m pleased the team performed well
 and we achieved the firing quickly and efficiently,' said 
Lieutenant Commander Chris L’Amie, who directed the firing from the frigate’s operations 
room.

'It really boosted 
confidence in the new radar ahead of Iron Duke’s deployment.'

Today, sailors used the system to track the target, which was being dragged along the surface of the sea by a long tow wire attached to an aircraft.

They then passed the data to the Seawolf missile to follow and shoot - before successfully blasting the object out of the sky with a direct hit, according to a Royal Navy statement.

The trial, which took place as the frigate made its way back to its home base in Portsmouth, followed eight weeks of tough training in Plymouth. 

'We had just finished 
eight hard weeks of training where we’d used Seawolf in simulation mode 
to defend ourselves against hostile aircraft and missiles,' said 
Lt Cmdr L’Amie.

“To cap off the training with
 a live shoot was hugely satisfying.'

Iron Duke is the first ship in Britain's fleet to have Artisan - also known as 997 in the Navy - and has been testing the system around the UK since completing a refit last year.

The revamp also saw her receive the latest version of Seawolf – a missile which has protected Navy frigates from air attack for more than 30 years.

Lieutenant Commander Jim Hyde, whose Short 
Range Air Defence (SHORAD) team is responsible for both Artisan and the 
upgraded Seawolf, was also on board Iron Duke for the successful shoot.

'Following
 a challenging trials and development programme, today was significant 
as it was the first time we have conducted a live firing with 997,' he 
said.

'It was rewarding
 to see both the new radar and the upgraded weapon system operate 
together perfectly, successfully demonstrating end-to-end combat system 
performance, and validating a lot of hard work done by agencies across 
MOD and in industry.'

At work: The system can track 800 targets simultaneously - and can even register objects 125 miles away

Artisan is being fitted to the Navy’s Type 23 frigates, as well as its two new aircraft carriers and assault ships Ocean and Albion.

It could also be the principal air radar of the Type 26 combat ships, successor to the 23s, which enter service next decade.

Astonishingly, the system can track up to 800 targets simultaneously - and can even register objects 125 miles (200 kilometres) away.
