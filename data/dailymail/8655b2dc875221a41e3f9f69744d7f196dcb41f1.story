It's the smile Liverpool  have been waiting for since August, but Mario Balotelli's delighted post-match grin has been one Reds supporters will finally be glad to see.

The Italian scored his first Premier League goal for the club after coming off the bench to dramatically snatch a late winner in the 3-2 win over Tottenham at Anfield.

Balotelli's goal came in a pulsating match between the clubs and could yet prove huge at the end of the season with both teams fighting to reach the top four and a Champions League place that goes with it.

Mario Balotelli posted a selfie on Instagram after scoring Liverpool's winner against Tottenham, thanking fans for sticking by him following his goal drought for the Reds

It’s been 850 playing minutes since Balotelli's last Premier League goal against Wigan on 28 November 2012.

The striker went 17 games without scoring.

In those 17 games, he fired in 19 shots on target, 17 shots off target and had 14 blocked.

The striker showed little emotion in his celebration after tapping home Adam Lallana's cross from close range, and even at the final whistle he refused to acknowledge the Kop and was the first Liverpool player to depart Anfield - with manager Brendan Rodgers also leaving early to catch a flight.

Balotelli did later show his delight and gratitude to fans after posting on social media.

'Great game guys!!!', Balotelli said on Instagram. 'This smile is ONLY for those that always believe and support me. Thank you and forza Liverpool. But now head down and keep working hard. Tonight is past.' 

Speaking in the absence of manager Brendan Rodgers, who had to catch a flight, assistant boss Colin Pascoe paid tribute to the Italian, who has struggled to settle back in English football since joining Liverpool for £16million last summer.

‘He is immensely happy,’ said Pascoe. ‘To get a winner at Anfield, I am sure he is happy.

‘It was great movement from Mario in the six-yard box. I hope it can be a springboard, he is training hard. The last couple of weeks he’s been ill and had gashes on his feet so couldn’t get his boots on.

Balotelli was a late introduction after coming on in the 74th minute before scoring nine minutes later.

His goal came after Mousa Dembele had equalised for Spurs following a second half Steven Gerrard penalty.

Lazar Markovic opened the scoring for the Reds in the first period, with Tottenham's in-form striker Harry Kane cancelling out the strike.
