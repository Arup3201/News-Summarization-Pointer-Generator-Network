Forget the Grinch, across the UK, it is our pets attempting to ruin Christmas.

Your cat or dog might be the most adorable and innocent creature in the world, but when the festive season comes around, it seems they suddenly become wild and unstoppable destroyers.

The house, with all of its Christmas decorations and especially your tree, becomes their terrible playground - as this hilarious collection of photos show.

'Christmas will be mine!': Forget the Grinch, it's our cats and dogs attempting to ruin the festive period

From cats attempting to climb the fir, to pooches eager to help shred the wrapping paper, these pictures capture some of the worst Christmas carnage we've ever seen.

Along with decorations strewn over the floor, trees lying on the ground and presents ripped open, the pets have gone to town on their owner's attempts to make their homes look festive. 

But their post-destruction big doe-eyed looks of love make it hard to stay mad for too long. 

'I know this looks bad, but it was the cat': The custom of bringing a tree indoors is too much for some pets

The ultimate dog shaming: This pooch dutifully accepts his punishment for helping open everyone's presents

'Oh hi, you're home early...': This moggy is merely assisting with the enormous amount of food to be eaten

'I just thought I'd help you open the cards': One dog looks shameful after destroying its owner's lounge

'Don't ask. But yes, I could use some help': One cat manage to get himself in a rather precarious situation 

'Just wait until they see my surprise': A feline makes a valiant attempt to become the star atop a tree

'And what?': Some pets are totally unapologetic about the havoc they wreak on our Christmas plans 

'This new game is fun!': The higher the decoration, the more points this dog apparently thinks he gets
