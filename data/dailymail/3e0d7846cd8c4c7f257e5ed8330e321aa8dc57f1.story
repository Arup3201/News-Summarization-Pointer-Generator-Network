A council worker called for police 'back-up' after he found a dog poo in a park.

The Tower Hamlets Enforcement Officer accused Amber Langtry, 35, of not clearing up after her German Shepherd in Victoria Park, East London, as she was walking her friend.

Miss Langtry denied the allegation, trying to explain that her dog had not been in the area where the attendant found the faeces, but still offered to pick it up to end the confrontation.

The council worker issued her with a ticket, which could result in a court hearing and a £1,000 fine, and called officers to the park on New Year's Day accusing her of 'non-compliance'.

Miss Langtry told the Evening Standard that she and her friend, who recorded the incident, had cleaned up their dogs’ mess earlier in the walk.

She also said the park attendant refused to show them the poo she was being challenged over.

In the ten-minute video the officer is heard accusing the woman of ‘non-compliance’ and calling officers to the scene.

He described Miss Langtry’s friend, who was recording him with her iPhone, as ‘aggressive’.

At one point, she is heard on the video saying: 'He can't even show us the poo - it's ridiculous!'

Miss Langtry was told by Tower Hamlets council, in a five-page letter, that it will not be continuing prosecution

Miss Langtry told the paper: ‘I remember thinking, “This is ridiculous. Why does he need police back-up for a five-foot-four woman looking for a dog poo?”’

‘When the police got here they were as bemused as I was, and they didn't have a problem with me or my dog.'

After half an hour, Miss Langtry was shown the poo, which she maintains was not left by her dog.

She told Mail Online: 'As I am a reasonable person, and would never leave a dog faeces behind, I picked it up in a poo bag and popped it in a nearby bin.'

She was told by Tower Hamlets council, in a five-page letter, that it will not be continuing prosecution, but that the officer has the power to deal with an offence ‘of failing to remove dog faces [sic]’.

Miss Langtry said that while the video is 'funny' to watch now, it was 'scary, intimidating and confusing at the time'.

The Metropolitan Police told the paper that no ‘allegation of crime’ was made to officers.

A council spokesperson said: 'The council has a long standing policy of tackling the issue of dog fouling. The council can confirm an incident took place on Wednesday, 1 January, where a Tower Hamlets Enforcement Officer (THEO) asked a dog owner to clean up after their dog.

'When the dog owner refused to give their name as the THEO requested, the THEO then called for appropriate back up after explaining the situation fully to the dog owner.

'We take dog fouling seriously in this borough as it is a concern for residents which is why the council took this course of action.'
