Liverpool turned on the style to thrash Ludogorets Razgrad 4-0 in their first-ever UEFA Youth League match on Tuesday afternoon.

Goals from Jerome Sinclair, Daniel Cleary and Alex O'Hanlon gave the Reds a commanding three-goal advantage at the break as the Bulgarians were blown away by their incisive attacking play.

And Sinclair grabbed his second a couple of minutes from time to round off the perfect afternoon for Neil Critchley's youngsters at Langtree Park in St Helens.

The Under 19 competition, in its second year, is a replica of the Champions League, with the same group pairings.

Facing the weakest team first of all, Liverpool were unsurprisingly on the offensive from the first whistle and Sinclair managed to miss the target with a close-range header from Sam Hart's cross early on.

Liverpool were a constant menace down the flanks, with Ryan Kent marauding on the right and Sheyi Ojo, who scored a hat-trick for the Under 21s at West Ham on his last outing, on the left.

And Ojo had a hand in Liverpool's first goal after half-an-hour, finding the run of left-back Hart, who broke through the Ludogorets defence to set up Sinclair. The forward produced an accomplished finish to get the European campaign up and running.

They needed just eight mintues to double that lead, with Cleary both starting and finishing the move. With a piece of improvisation, he found O'Hanlon with the outside of his boot and then headed home the return pass after finding space in the penalty area.

Firmly in the ascendancy, Liverpool were three to the good just moments later. Kent sprinted forward and squared to O'Hanlon, who found the back of the net with two assured touches.

The hosts took their foot off the gas after the break but they produced a final flourish in the last minute.

Substitute Harry Wilson struck a free-kick that rebounded off the post and bounced kindly for Sinclair, who accepted the gift.

Liverpool travel to Switzerland to play Basle in their next match on October 1.
