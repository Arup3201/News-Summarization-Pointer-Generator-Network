One man went above and beyond to surprise his girlfriend with a very romantic engagement.

Colton BrockBank, 25, of Draper, Utah, is an extreme athlete, and convinced his girlfriend, Taylor Naho'olewa, that he had broke his back in a wakeboarding accident on Valentine's Day earlier this year.

When she showed up however, he had a big surprise up his sleeve.

Big surprise: Colton BrockBank got his girlfriend Taylor Naho'olewa (above) to come to the hospital after saying he had broke his back in a wakeboarding accident

Gift: Because it was Valentine's Day, he gave her flowers 

Getting ready: Then, as Taylor went to hug Colton's mother, he quickly got up out of the bed

BrockBank went all out for the surprise, putting himself in a neck brace with an oxygen mask and fake IV in his arm.

When Naho'olewa appeared, he handed her some flowers, feigning difficulty moving his arms, and as she turned around to hug his mother, he sprang in to action.

BrockBank ripped off the brace and took off the mask, and got down on one knee to ask Naho'olewa to marry him.

Awwww: Colton then surprised Taylor by dropping to one knee and proposing

Bling: Her presented his girlfriend with this diamond ring

She said yes: A thrilled and surprised Taylor said 'yes' and jumped into his arms

She was more excited then angry, and immediately said 'yes,' jumping into his arms.

As for how all those cameras did not tip her off, BrockBank had told her he was being filmed that day for a wakeboarding stunt.

The couple, who are both devout Mormons, were married in September.
