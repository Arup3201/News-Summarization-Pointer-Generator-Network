Rob Ford today admitted that he is still drinking despite a year of scandals including crack-smoking which led to him being stripped of his powers as Toronto mayor.

The leader of Canada's largest city said on Tuesday that he continued to drink but not excessively. He said: 'That's past me and we're moving on. I just can't wait for the campaign and I want to start debating my opponents.'

Ford described himself as in 'great shape' from daily gym visits and claimed to have dropped a few pounds, all while campaigning hard to get himself re-elected in October.

Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford admitted on Tuesday that although his heavy drinking is a thing of the past, he is still drinking

It's been an unforgiving year for the 
Toronto mayor, plagued with a string of scandals from crack-smoking to 
drunkenly impersonating a Jamaican accent and jaywalking.

Additionally, Ford inadvertently tackled a
 female member of the City Council as he attempted to confront a heckler
 during a meeting that was held to determine whether to strip him of 
many of his mayoral powers.

Ford told the Today show: 'I don't use illegal drugs. I experimented with them probably a year ago, but I don't use drugs.'

Ford was also caught on camera, clearly inebriated, speaking in a Jamaican accent in a fast-food restaurant in January. The video of the mayor, who only weeks before had claimed to have gotten sober, went viral online.

Speaking of the incident today, Ford said: 'I've
 been brought up with a lot of Jamaican friends. I drank and I enjoyed 
myself... I can't remember what night it was. Maybe you're perfect but I'm 
not.'

In January, Ford was caught on camera drunk and cursing in a Jamaican accent while in a fast-food restaurant

Just this weekend, Ford was caught on camera running groin-first into a fire hydrant as he celebrated the Canadian Olympic hockey team winning a gold medal in Sochi.

On February 1, Ford was seen at a Toronto bar when he disappeared into the bathroom for more than an hour.

When he emerged, he was speaking in a 'nonsensical language,' according to the Toronto Star. He then remained at the bar and ordered drinks well after the city-mandated last call at 2am.

Ford ultimately was stripped by the City Council of many of his powers, which were handed over to the city's deputy mayor.

When asked by Matt Lauer on Today if he was still effective in his role as mayor, Ford replied: 'Absolutely. We had a major ice storm and I led the charge in getting power back on.

'There has been the lowest tax increase in years, saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars... we're building subways. We're on fire.'

Ford invited Lauer to speak to him in a few months to check on his progress.
