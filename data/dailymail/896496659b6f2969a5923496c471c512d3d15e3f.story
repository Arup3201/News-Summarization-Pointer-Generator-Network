A surgeon has been stood down after allegedly cutting out a patient’s healthy testicle and removing the wrong kidney from another.

Urologist Antonio Vega Vega was suspended from operating at Rockhampton Hospital in central Queensland after authorities were alerted to four separate cases of surgical malpractice since late 2011.

Rockhampton Hospital’s acting director of medical services and director of surgery were also suspended, Queensland Health Minister Lawrence Springborg said.

The Health Service Board became concerned by comments made by a coroner about local health services and commissioned a review by Vanguard Health.

That review highlighted three cases of negligence by Dr Vega Vega –including him removing a healthy testicle in one patient, the wrong kidney in another, and nicking an artery in a third.

Board chairman Charles Ware said one of the patient’s involved had to be transported to Brisbane for follow-up care after surgery by Dr Vega Vega.

‘It would appear that an artery was nicked during surgery but not detected, and (the patient) later re-presented to hospital with quite substantial blood loss,’ Mr Ware told Fairfax Radio.

A fourth case occurred late last month, before the urologist was stood down.

Dr Vega Vega has also voluntarily stood aside from his private work at the Mater Hospital following the allegations.

He could not be contacted by the MailOnline.

Mr Springborg said an independent inquiry had been launched into the four cases, while Rockhampton Hospital and the Health Service Board would undertake another review.

‘Systems to protect patients from botched surgery are fundamental to clinical practice,’ he told parliament.

Dr Vega Vega graduated from a Spanish university in 1988 and completed specialist training as a urologist in 1996.

A year later, he obtained European registration.

He also acquired a PhD with honours in 2001 and attained his Australian qualifications in 2011 after two years of follow-up training.

Dr Vega Vega had previously worked at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital and Nambour Hospital.
