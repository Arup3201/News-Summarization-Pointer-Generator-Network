A devoted father has donated 20 per cent of his own liver to his critically ill son to provide him with a replacement, which will grow as he does and eventually become a replica of the original organ.

Muhammed Ali Tariq was poorly from birth, but was diagnosed with liver disease at just nine weeks old, and his only hope was an urgent transplant.

But in what is the greatest gift of life, his father Tariq Mushtaq has given his son a portion of his liver, which means he now has a healthy organ that will get bigger as he gets older to match his father's.

Tariq Mushtaq has donated 20 per cent of his own liver to his critically ill son Muhammed Ali Tariq to provide him with a replacement, which will grow as he does and eventually become a replica of the original organ

On December 6, last year, the transplant went ahead, and 20 per cent of Tariq's liver was removed at St John's Hospital in Leeds before being transported by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary to be introduced to Muhammed Ali's body

Mr Mushtaq, 37, said: 'Muhammed Ali's liver was taken away completely and replaced with 20 per cent of mine.

'The idea is that my 20 per cent is the equivalent to his 100 per cent now. As he grows, the liver will regenerate with him and always be sufficient to do what he needs it to do.

'It's nothing short of an absolute miracle, and I struggle to comprehend how amazing it is.

'We have got the same scars running down our chests and I will always remember being able to do this for him.'

Before Mr Mushtaq could be accepted as a donor for his son, he had to go through a rigorous two-month process of speaking to doctors, social workers and psychologists to make sure he was prepared

Muhammed Ali, from Nelson, 
Lancashire, was born on 13 July 2012, but at just seven weeks old, he 
was diagnosed with liver disease.

'It was a normal birth, but we noticed that Muhammed Ali was jaundiced,' said Mr Mushtaq.

'We
 brought it to the doctors' attention but we weren't too concerned 
because we have three older children, who were also jaundiced after they
 were born.

'However after a few weeks, it didn't pass so we started to get a bit more worried so we went to the local hospital, who ran some tests.

'We realised something serious was going on when we were transferred over to the Leeds General Infirmary for specialist care.'

Muhammed Ali Tariq was poorly from birth, but was diagnosed with liver disease at just nine weeks old

Tariq, and his wife Asia, 31, were told of his condition, something they had only ever associated with alcoholism and other complications.

Doctors told the family that Muhammed Ali's liver was very badly damaged and beyond repair, but it is still unknown what caused it.

After months of tests and scans, the couple, who also have three daughters - Alisha, 12, Aliya, nine and Haleema, three - was told their only option was a transplant, and in September last year, Muhammed Ali was placed on the waiting list for a new liver. 

Mr Mushtaq, who works in sales, said: 'There are two words in our family that we never want to hear. One is cancer and the other is transplant. When we heard transplant, it completely took us aback and we were all over the place. 

'They said that without it he would 
get progressively worse rapidly, and we were already in hospital with 
him almost weekly with various complications.

'We
 could have waited for someone to pass away and an organ to become 
available but we could see him getting worse so I enquired and learned 
about live donor transplants.

'I
 just felt that this was the option for us, and my wife and I made a 
joint decision that this was the best thing for Muhammed Ali.'

Before
 Mr Mushtaq could be accepted as a donor for his son, he had to go 
through a rigorous two-month process of speaking to doctors, social 
workers and psychologists to make sure he was prepared for the 
procedure.

'They were very satisfied with me 
mentally and physically, and I had to undergo a whole series of tests 
which said my liver was in an extremely good condition,' he said.

'It was a very scary time but I knew it was the right thing for my son.'

On
 December 6, last year, the transplant went ahead, and 20 per cent of 
Tariq's liver was removed at St John's Hospital in Leeds before being 
transported by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary to be introduced to 
Muhammed Ali's body.

Tariq, and his wife Asia, 31, were told of their son's condition, something they had only ever associated with alcoholism and other complications

Mr Mushtaq said: 'It was a very worrying time for my wife. She has her husband on one side and her son on the other'

The risks included blood clotting, internal bleeding, various infections and a 1 in 200 chance of death.

Mr Mushtaq said: 'It was a very worrying time for my wife. She has her husband on one side and her son on the other.

'I told her just to worry about him, and she did a fantastic job. People have called me brave, but she was the brave one.

'She's been through so much having to watch two members of her family undergo major surgery at once and she's been so strong.'

Since the operations, which were both a complete success, Muhammed Ali has seen enormous health benefits, and despite having to take anti-rejection medication for the rest of his life, both father and son are well on the road to recovery.

Mr Mushtaq added: 'He was in intensive care for two days while he recovered, but when they took him on to the ward they said the change was dramatic.

'We saw immediate change in him and he has become a different child. He's smiling, and he's happy, and they expect him to make a complete recovery.'

The pair have formed an incredibly special bond, are now looking forward to the fun of being father and son, and activities they couldn't do before due to Muhammed Ali's condition.

'I look forward to going swimming with him, walking in the park and kicking a little ball about with him,' said Tariq.

'I would recommend this to anyone to give the gift of life. It's brought us closer and it can bring me to the point of tears.

'I look at him and there's something between us, we have a very unique bond.

'Every day we have a fresh zest for life, and for that I really want to thank the NHS. They have done wonders for us and been so supportive throughout.'
