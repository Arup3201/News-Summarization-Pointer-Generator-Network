A man has been jailed after faking his own kidnap in order to swindle more than £1,000 in ransom money from his girlfriend.

Scheming Mohammed Kahn, 33, of Burntwood, Staffordshire, even sent pictures from a mobile phone to his partner, Surrena Lilly, showing fake injuries he painted on his own body using make-up.

A court heard further text messages were then sent to Ms Lilly demanding £1,200 for his release as he concocted his elaborate story in October last year.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard Mohammed Kahn faked his own kidnap to swindle money from his girlfriend Surrena Lilly - and even sent her pictures of fake injuries he painted on his body using make-up

But the Kahn was caught out after he asked for a further four-figure sum and his girlfriend contacted police.

Officers then turned up at Kahn's home and uncovered his plot after finding him safe and well and discovering his mobile phone.

The court heard the faked kidnapping took place over five days between October 8 and October 13 last year.

Andrew Keogh, prosecuting, said the text messages included threats Kahn would be hurt and picture messages of fake injuries.

Judge Nicholas Webb (pictured) said Kahn's unusual crime was 'mean, cynical and nasty'

He added: 'The complainant was sceptical, but in the end on October 13 came to the conclusion that there was something in it.'

Mr Keogh said Ms Lilly used £200 of her own money and borrowed £1,000 from a friend to pay.

But Kahn continued his ploy, sending her another text message demanding a further £1,500 for his release.

Mr Keogh added: 'The police attended the defendant's home and found him unharmed and in possession of the mobile phone.

'He was arrested and said he was forced to send the text messages from two men.'

Neil Skinner, defending, said: 'This is an unusual offence.

'He did owe people money and there was a lot of pressure to pay those people back.

'What he did then was use his position in his relationship to obtain money in the way he accepts he did.

'Maybe he could have asked her for it.'

The court heard the couple have since split up.

On Friday Kahn was jailed for four months after pleading guilty to fraud at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Webb said: 'I regard this as a mean, cynical and nasty offence against an emotional victim.

'You are 33, you are aware she seems to have liked you and you know that and took advantage of that emotionally in a cynical way'
