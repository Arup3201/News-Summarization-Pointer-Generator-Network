The father of artificial Intelligence - who inspired a million sci-fi fantasies that robots could one day live alongside humans - has died at the age of 84.

John McCarthy's death was confirmed - fittingly for a man who also laid the foundations for the internet - on Twitter by Stanford University, where he was professor for four decades.

His pioneering work in AI included creating the programming language much of modern AI is based on.

Tribute: John McCarthy, the 'father of artificial Intelligence' who inspired a million sci-fi fantasies that robots could one day live alongside humans, has died at the age of 84

He also prophesied the concept of e-commerce in the 1970s and made tremendous advances in computer time-sharing - which ultimately lowered the cost of using computers.

The death of the Silicon Valley innovator follows those of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and C programming creator and UNIX co-developer Dennis Ritchie earlier this month.

McCarthy, renowned as an AI world leader who coined the term in a 1955 research proposal, once said: 'Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.'

He went on to create the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Artificial Intelligence Lab and then the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, serving as its director from 1965 to 1980.

Professor McCarthy coined the term 'artificial intelligence' - but while it's spawned a million robot monsters in popular culture, the reality is around us all the time.

Artificial intelligence refers to computers taking a 'human-like' approach to problems, looking at their environments and finding the 'best' solution to a problem.

It is used in applications from computer chess programmes that can outperform human players, to video game characters that react 'intelligently' to the player.

Apple's Siri voice-control software can imitate human response convincingly across a huge range of language, using very complex algorithms.

None of these are truly 'intelligent' in the human sense - but they can emulate human behaviours well enough that we find it easier to deal with the computers beneath.

In 1958, he invented the programming language Lisp, which paved the way for voice recognition technology, including Siri, the personal assistant application on the newest iPhone 4s.

Prof McCarthy also developed the concept of computer time-sharing, which allowed multiple users to interact with a single computer.

It was a major development for the 1960s and let several people draw at the same time from a single computer course, like a mainframe, without having to buy one.

By lowering costs, it allowed more people to use computers and laid the groundwork for the interactive - and cloud - computing of today.

Born in Boston on September 4, 1927, McCarthy moved west to pursue a maths degree at the California Institute of Technology.

He received a doctorate in Maths from Princeton University in 1951, becoming a professor there until 1953.

He also worked at MIT and Dartmouth before settling at Stanford in 1962 until his retirement at the end of 2000. In the 1970s he prophesied what would become e-commerce.

'He presented a paper in France on buying and selling by computer, what is now called electronic commerce,' said Whitfield Diffie, an internet security expert who worked as his researcher at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

In the 1960s and 1970s the Stanford lab played a vital role in creating the systems that mimic many human skills - including vision, listening, reasoning and the movement of limbs in robots.

In 1972 journalist Stewart Brand wrote about the group in Rolling Stone magazine under the headline 'SPACEWAR: Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums.'

He described a group of researchers free to create their own virtual worlds. He wrote: 'Ready or not, computers are coming to the people.'

It was during the 1970s that McCarthy invited the Homebrew Computer Club, a Silicon Valley hobbyist group, to meet at the Stanford lab.

Among the members were Steve Jobs and Steven Wozniak, who would go on to found Apple.

Ed Feigenbaum, professor emeritus of computer science at Stanford and a colleague recruited by McCarthy in the 1960s, said: 'He could be blunt, but John was always kind and generous with his time, especially with students, and he was sharp until the end.

'He was always focused on the future. Always inventing, inventing, inventing.'

The father-of three won the A.M. Turing Award in 1971, the highest recognition in computer science, for his contributions to AI.

He was also honoured with the Kyoto Prize in 1988 and the National Medal of Science in 1990. He died at home in Palo Alto, California, on Monday and is survived by his third wife, Carolyn Talcott.

McCarthy's second wife, Vera Watson, died in 1978 in a mountain-climbing accident attempting to scale Annapurna in Nepal.
