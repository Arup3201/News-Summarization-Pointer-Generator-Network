Ex-Vermont Governor and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean castigated big banks and big businesses as anti-capitalist this afternoon during a forum at the progressive Netroots Nation conference.

'We don't have capitalism in this country,' he said at one point. 'We have an enormous 
oligopoly that's strangling the innovation that happens with small 
businesses, which is where the genes of America has really been.'

Dean was in the midst of previewing the 
Democratic Party's bench of potential presidential candidates when he 
launched into a diatribe on the ramifications of allowing banks
 to become too big to fail and the importance of Massachusetts Senator 
Elizabeth Warren's efforts to more strictly regulate America's financial
 institutions.

Tell us how you really feel: Former Vermont Governor Howard Dean gave a scathing critique of America's economy during a forum today at a progressive conference

'I don't hate the banks, but the truth of the matter is they are not 
capitalist organizations. They are basically oligopolies,' Dean claimed during his tirade.

'The problem . . . is not that they're evil and horrible - although we can debate that,' he said.Â  'The problem is they're so big that if they 
fail, they have to be bailed out.

'So it's not capitalism.'

Dean has publicly criticized the banking industry before, but his remarks in Detroit, Michigan, today appear to be the first time the former Democratic National Committee chairman has characterized their practices as anti-free market. In past discussions Dean has stopped at saying lenders need to be better regulated and banks need to be downsized.

Say, cheese: 11 years after his failed presidential bid, Howard Dean is still a favorite speaker of Netroots Nation-goers

While prognosticating on the 2016 presidential election, Dean said today that he didn't think Warren would run, but 'some of the stuff she's saying about the banks has absolutely gotta be said.'

He later claimed that Warren 'is actually pro-capitalist because capitalism is hurt more by capitalists than it is by people who oppose capitalism.'

'And she articulates this better than anybody I've seen,' he said, concluding his remarks on the state of America's economy.

'So, I don't think she's gonna get in unless Hillary doesn't run,' he predicted, coming back to the original topic. And if that happens, 'I know you guys are going to do everything you can to make sure she gets in whether she likes it our not,' he said, eliciting laughter and clapping from audience members.

'She's very, very smart,' he added.
