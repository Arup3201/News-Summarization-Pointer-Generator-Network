A one-time high school football star who spent more than five years behind bars after he was falsely accused of rape has signed with a professional football team.

Brian Banks, a 26-year-old linebacker from Long Beach, California, has signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League just four months after he was exonerated.

Locomotives coach Jim Fassel, who confirmed the news, said the team is pleased to give Banks 'an opportunity in football that was denied him years ago'.

'As I pursue the #NFL, the #UFL will be a
vessel to gain experience, and prepare me for a possible mid season 
pick up or next NFL season!' Banks wrote on Twitter.

Banks was 16 and had just been offered a scholarship to USC when Wanetta Gibson accused him of sexual assault and kidnapping in 2002.

He
was on the way to the school office to talk about his college 
applications when he bumped into Gibson, a fellow student, and they went
to a stairwell to make out, his attorney Justin Brooks said.

He
explained that Banks said something to upset Gibson and they parted on 
bad terms. She later accused him of kidnapping her, dragging her across 
the school and raping her in the stairwell.

Success: Banks, pictured during his tryouts for the Seattle Seahawks, signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives

Future: The team said they were glad to give Banks the opportunity he should have had years ago

Determined: Banks never gave up on his dream to play football and had been in full training since October

Investigators
tested her but found no physical evidence of rape, Brooks said. Banks 
maintained they had not had sex and all sexual contact had been 
consensual.

Yet his then-lawyer encouraged the 
promising student to plead no contest to the kidnap and rape charges, 
warning Banks he could get 41 years to life in prison if convicted.

Expecting he would serve just 18 months instead, he followed the advice and pleaded no contest - and was put behind bars for nearly six years - but he never lost sight of his NFL dream.

He told ESPN he has been seriously training since last October,: 'After all I’ve been through these last 10 years, I can still do some things that will impress you.'

He was exonerated in May after Gibson added him as a friend on Facebook when he left prison
with a tag a few months earlier. In a message, she explained she wanted to 'let bygones be 
bygones'.

A life shattered: Banks had been recruited by colleges and offered scholarships before the accusation

Brooks said his client met Gibson and caught her on video saying there there had been no kidnap and no 
rape, and would help him clear his record.

Yet she refused to repeat the story to prosecutors as she feared she 
would have to return a $1.5 million payment she won after her mother 
brought a suit against Long Beach Schools.

She was quoted as telling Banks: 'I will go through with helping you but
it's like at the same time all that money they gave us, I mean gave me,
I don't want to have to pay it back.'

The Los Angeles Times also reported
that Gibson had been worried the admission would affect her 
relationship with her two children, now aged four and five.

The 26-year-old has said he does not 
plan to pursue legal action against his accuser, and Los Angeles 
prosecutors have said it is unlikely Gibson will be charged with making 
false accusations.

Remorse:

but would not admit it to prosecutors as she feared she would have to 
pay back $1.5 million won in a case against the school

After
the exoneration, Banks added: 'My only dream in the world 
is just to be free... For years, I felt like a toy with the switch cut 
off, sitting on the shelf.'

Once he was cleared, Banks received 
tryout invitations from the Washington Redskins, Kansas City Chiefs, 
Miami Dolphins and Seattle Seahawks.

The Locomotives confirmed his signing in a statement on Wednesday and will hold a press conference with Banks on Thursday to announce the signing.

The league opens play next Wednesday with Fassell’s Locomotives taking on the Virginia Destroyers, coached by former NFL head coach Marty Schottenheimer.
