A father of eight has sparked controversy by refusing to save money for his children’s college education.

Guerilla Parenting author David T. Fagan told the Washington Post that college is 'a lot of wasted time' and if his children want to attend, they will have to pay for it themselves.

The 37-year-old marketing entrepreneur, whose family lives in Orange County, California, added to MailOnline: 'The focus is too much on a piece of paper and not enough on self-reliance.'

Family man: David T. Fagan, a father of eight, says if his kids want to go to college they have to pay for it themselves (center) and their eight children, says college is a resource, not a destination 

He continued: 'College isn't necessarily bad - it can be quite good - but it quite often needs to be customized. Kids are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many times, that money could be spent differently and more efficiently in helping people become truly self-reliant.'

Mr Fagan says that while he'd approve if his kids, whose ages range from two to 17, paid for school with jobs and scholarships, what he really wants is for them to start their own business, which will ultimately teach them more and be far more lucrative.

'College might help you learn what you love,' he told the Washington Post. 'But it's a method. It’s a process. It’s a tool, it’s a resource.

Entrepreneurial spirit: Mr Fagan, now the owner of a branding and promotional firm, moved to California from a small town in Oregon at 17 and persuaded an electronics company to hire him as a salesperson

'It’s not the destination. Too many people go to college as if that is the finish line. And that’s why you see all these people sleeping on their parents’ couches.'

Oregon-born Mr Fagan, who was the oldest of six, says his parents raised him to work for anything he wanted. He left high school after the 11th grade and only briefly attended the University of Phoenix.

At 17, he moved to California  and persuaded an electronics company to hire him as a salesperson.

Mr Fagan is now the owner of Icon Builder Media, a branding and promotional firm. He believes business skills are more valuable these days than the kind of knowledge taught in school.

By the book: Mr Fagan shares his views in Guerilla Parenting, out this January

'Who are the people who make the most money overall? What are the careers? Sales people. Entrepreneurs. 

'Maybe only 10 percent to 20 percent of those sales people or entrepreneurs are really doing well but that 10 to 20 percent of those people are drastically slanting the numbers against anything else,' he says.

He says that even if his 15-year-old daughter Taylor, whom he deems 'perfect' for college, becomes an attorney, he will encourage her to open up her own practice rather than working for someone else.

Mr Fagan says the biggest problem in society now is the inability of parents to teach kids to go after what they want.

'You very rarely see two or three generations of success in a row because that one person gets the success and what do they say? They say, “I never want my kid to go through what I went through.” When what they went through was exactly what made them a success.

'So what do they do? “I’m going to send you to the best school. I’m going to send you to the best college. I’m going to give you this, I’m going to give you that. I’m going to give you all the things I never had” –without them ever having to work for it. 

'And so by giving them things they’re kind of condemning them to a life of mediocrity.' 

Guerilla Parenting will be released in January 2015.
