The Ffestiniog narrow-gauge line is one of the most picturesque steam railways in the country.

More than 1,000 people a day take the hour-long journey through the stunning Snowdonia mountains and forests between the coastal resort of Porthmadog and the slate quarrying town of Blaenau Ffestiniog in North Wales.

Six miles away, on the Conwy Valley line, is one of the quietest railway stations in Wales – just 25 people a week get on or off at Roman Bridge, and to board you need to flag down the driver of one of the 12 two-car diesels a day.

Back on track: Roger Latham is selling The Station House at Roman Bridge Blaenau Dolwyddelan in North Wales, for £450,000 after buying it for under £60,000 16 years ago

Now the stationmaster’s house at Roman Bridge is up for sale for £450,000. The ticket office has long gone and there is no waiting room, buffet or toilets. What remains is a single track, the platform and the house.

Built in 1879, it has three bedrooms, three reception rooms and stunning views across the mountains and valleys. Outside there are ten acres of meadows and a lake stocked with salmon and trout. The owner, Roger Latham, bought it in 1997 but has known the area for 60 years.

‘I was raised in Macclesfield but started coming here on fishing holidays with my father in the 1950s,’ says Roger, 66, a retired college lecturer. He moved to the region 40 years ago.

‘I had known Flo Williams, the daughter of the last stationmaster, who bought the house from British Rail.

‘As she grew older she became more anxious about things and in 1997 decided to move. She found a buyer for the house, but at the last minute they changed their minds, which caused Flo terrible anxiety, so I bought it for the asking price.’

He paid £59,000, but Roger has since spent tens of thousands renovating it and adding a garden room with splendid views of the 17th Century clapper bridge. This was built to replace the original Roman bridge, from which the station takes its name.

‘The Romans came here to mine copper and lead and had a garrison nearby,’ says Roger, who replaced the roof of the house and installed underfloor heating and a solar-powered hot-water system.

‘The work was done by a local craftsman and inside it has a very cosy feel,’ he says.

When the renovations were finished, Roger was ready to move in, but a friend asked if her father could rent it temporarily. He ended up staying for more than a decade, and since then Roger has been letting it to tourists.

‘It’s occupied for about 85 per cent  of the year. The area is very popular with walkers, artists and anglers,’ says Roger. ‘The house comes with more than a mile of double-bank fishing on the River Lledr.

‘It is wonderful in late summer and early autumn when the migrant birds are still here and the Atlantic salmon return from west Greenland to the streams to spawn.

First-class upgrade: Although Roger bought the house for £59,00, he has spent several thousand over the years improving the old stationmaster's home

‘The weather is mild and there is  an abundance of food for the wildlife – I’ve seen three otters in the meadow and there are bats, lizards, toads, polecats and weasels.’

The nearby 13th Century Dolwyddelan Castle, which was one of the last to be taken during Edward I’s conquest of Wales, is also a big draw.

In high season Roger charges £680 a week, but has now decided to sell up.

‘I’m getting a bit long in the tooth, so it’s time to find a new owner,’ he says.

Martyn Haden, of Strutt & Parker’s Chester office, which is selling the property, said: ‘It’s the dream property for anyone who had a model railway while growing up.’

In spite of the tranquil location and the slow pace of the trains that trundle past, you can get to London by rail in less than four hours.

‘It’s 50 minutes from here to Llandudno Junction and then just three hours to Euston,’ says Roger.
