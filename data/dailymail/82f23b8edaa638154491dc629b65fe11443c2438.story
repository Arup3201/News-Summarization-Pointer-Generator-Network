Uganda’s president yesterday described gay people as ‘unnatural’ and ‘disgusting’ after signing a controversial bill that punishes homosexual sex with up to life in prison.

Yoweri Museveni said the bill, which goes into effect immediately, was needed because the West is promoting homosexuality in Africa.

It is a measure likely to send Uganda's beleaguered gay community further underground as the police try to implement it amid fevered anti-homosexual sentiment across the country.

He told CNN: 'They're disgusting. What sort of people are they? I never knew what they were doing.

‘I've
 been told recently that what they do is terrible. Disgusting. But I was
 ready to ignore that if there was proof that that's how he is born, 
abnormal. But now the proof is not there.'

Scientists
 had written a report which found there is no proven genetic basis for 
homosexuality, Mr Museveni said, citing it as a reason for signing the 
bill.

He added: ‘I was 
regarding it as an inborn problem. Genetic distortion - that was my 
argument. But now our scientists have knocked this one out.’

Mr Museveni may have defied Western 
pressure to shelve the bill, four years and many versions after it was 
introduced, but his move pleased many Ugandans who repeatedly urged him 
to sign it.

Nigeria's 
president similarly signed an anti-gay bill into law just over a month 
ago, sparking increased violence against gays who already were 
persecuted in mob attacks.

Some watchdog groups warn a similar 
backlash of violence may occur in Uganda - where support is now likely 
to be galvanized for Mr Museveni ahead of presidential elections.

‘Experience
 from other jurisdictions with similarly draconian laws, such as Nigeria
 or Russia, indicates that their implementation is often followed by a 
surge in violence against individuals thought to be lesbian, gay, 
bisexual or transgender,’ an International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights 
Commission spokesman said.

President Yoweri Museveni's bill is popular in Uganda, a country where homosexuality is already illegal

‘The Ugandan government has not indicated any plans to counter such violence or to investigate potential allegations of abuse.’

The Ugandan law calls for first-time offenders to be sentenced to 14 years in jail.

It
 sets life imprisonment as the maximum penalty for ‘aggravated 
homosexuality,’ defined as repeated gay sex between consenting adults 
and acts involving a minor, a disabled person or where one partner is 
infected with HIV.

Uganda's new anti-gay law has been condemned around the world.

In
 Washington, White House press secretary Jay Carney called the law 
‘abhorrent,’ urged its repeal and said the White House is reviewing its 
relationship with Uganda.

United
 Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned that the 
law would institutionalise discrimination and could encourage harassment
 and violence against gays.

The
 office of European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton in a 
statement said that she ‘is deeply concerned’ by ‘draconian legislation’ 
to criminalise homosexuality in Uganda.

At
 least six people have already been arrested over alleged homosexual 
offences and more than a dozen have fled Uganda since lawmakers passed 
the bill in December, according to a prominent Ugandan gay activist, 
Pepe Julian Onziema.

‘The president is making this decision because he has never met an openly gay person. That disappoints me,’ he said.

Mr
 Museveni signed the bill at the presidential palace as government 
officials, journalists and Ugandan scientists looked on. Government 
officials applauded after Museveni affixed his signature.

‘They should rehabilitate themselves and society should assist them to do so,’ Mr Museveni said after signing the bill.

Some
 European countries have threatened to cut aid to Uganda if the measure 
was enacted, though some EU officials have cautioned that interrupting 
development aid may not be the best reaction since it would harm 
Ugandans.

US President 
Barack Obama warned that signing the bill would ‘complicate’ the East 
African country's relationship with Washington.

'We have been disappointed for a long time by the conduct of the West. There is now an attempt at social imperialism'

Yoweri Museveni

After Mr Museveni signed the bill, the White House said the US would urge Uganda's government to repeal the ‘abhorrent law.’

‘As
 President Obama has said, this law is more than an affront and a danger
 to the gay community in Uganda, it reflects poorly on the country's 
commitment to protecting the human rights of its people and will 
undermine public health, including efforts to fight HIV/AIDS,’ a 
statement said.

But in 
signing the legislation passed by lawmakers, Mr Museveni said he 
rejected such reaction as interference in Ugandan affairs.

‘We Africans never seek to impose our view on others. If only they could let us alone,’ Mr Museveni said.

‘We have been disappointed for a long time by the conduct of the West. There is now an attempt at social imperialism.’

Mr
 Museveni accused ‘arrogant and careless Western groups’ of trying to 
recruit Ugandan children into homosexuality, but he did not name these 
purported groups.

Mr 
Museveni said he believes Western homosexuals have targeted poor 
Ugandans who then ‘prostitute’ themselves for the money, an allegation 
repeated by the bill's Ugandan defenders.
