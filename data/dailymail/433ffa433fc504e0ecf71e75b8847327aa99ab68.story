‘Chapter one…he adored New York City’. 

So goes the opening line of Woody Allen’s cult hit, Manhattan.

But despite the film's reputation as a classic ode to New York, the grittier neighbourhoods of Brooklyn clearly weren't on the auteur's radar when he penned his masterpiece a quarter of a century ago.

Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg is at the centre of the Brooklyn revolution, which has seen an influx of young urbanites, fashionistas and bearded hipsters relocating to the borough

Sex and the City might have provided a sugar-coated view of the city during the 1990s.

But the thought of one of the fashion-obsessed singletons living amongst the industrialised suburbs was enough to make Carrie Bradshaw choke on her cosmopolitan.

Not anymore.

The once run-down borough, for so long a destination solely to be passed through to get from Manhattan to JFK Airport, now caters for the young urbanites, fashionistas as well as bearded hipsters who have been priced out of the city.

It is also home to a fair few celebrities who have followed the middle-classes, with Anne Hathaway, Lena Dunham and British actor Patrick Stewart all residents of the borough.

Even Sarah Jessica Parker herself is said to be house hunting in the area.

So, despite being well behind the times, I finally decided to see what all the fuss was about and join the crowds flocking over the East River for a dose of shabby-chic glamour, foodie heaven and cutting edge bars.

One of the most spectacular views of the New York skyline is offered by the McCarren Hotel & Pool – a vibrant, boutique establishment set in the heart of Williamsburg

Sheltering Sky, the Moroccan-themed rooftop lounge set on the hotel’s eighth floor, is open all year round and allows guests to enjoy one of the most breath-taking views of Manhattan

The Art Deco-inspired pool at the McCarren hotel has been described as the ‘ultimate urban retreat’

Williamsburg is the neighbourhood leading the borough's meteoric revolution, and thankfully for all the Manhattanites they don't have to stray too far from their spiritual home to get there.

Just one stop on the subway from New York's Lower East Side, the lively Bedford Avenue is at the epicentre of the area's transformation from a tough inner-city neighbourhood to Bohemian paradise.

While you might not find a Manolo Blahnik boutique here just yet, you could probably pick up a second-hand pair from the myriad of vintage stores and flea markets springing up inside former factory buildings and derelict warehouses.

Renowned clothes store Beacon’s Closet in nearby Greenpoint is a must for fashion enthusiasts, while the weekend-only indoor market Artists and Fleas provides the perfect introduction to the growing collection of Boho locals selling handmade arts and craft items, jewellery and retro clothing. 

There is no doubting the buzz around Williamsburg, now referred to by locals as simply The ‘Burg

And if the wealth of cocktail bars lining the streets of Williamsburg isn't enough to tempt Manhattanites over the river, then the rooftop bars and boutique hotels certainly will be.

One of the most spectacular views of New York's skyline is offered by the McCarren Hotel & Pool – a vibrant, boutique establishment set slap-bang in the heart of the action.

Sheltering Sky, the Moroccan-themed, rooftop lounge set on the hotel’s eighth floor, is open all year round and allows guests to enjoy one of the most breath-taking panoramic views back over the East River towards the city.

The hotel's location provided the perfect base for bar-hopping during our week-long trip, and ringing in the New Year at this intimate bar was among the highlights of our visit. 

I’m told this 64-room hotel has thrown some legendary parties, attracting A-list guests such as Jude Law, while the hotel’s Art Deco-inspired pool area has been described as the ‘ultimate urban retreat’.

Brooklyn's illustrious brewing heritage has  been revived following the introduction of the Brooklyn Brewery in 1988. It has become such a staple part of Brooklyn life that it now offers free tours of its premises

Despite the rapid gentrification that has transformed Brooklyn, there is still a nod to the area’s rich history.

Before prohibition, the borough boasted 48 breweries and its illustrious heritage has more recently been revived following the introduction of the Brooklyn Brewery in 1988.

The brewery, which supplies many of the alehouses and craft beer bars in Brooklyn, has become such an integral part of the area's transformation that it now even offers free tours.

If any better evidence were needed of the area’s change in fortunes it comes from the brewery’s owners, who proudly declare: ‘It used to be that we'd be lucky to cobble together 15 brave souls to visit the wilds of Williamsburg on a Saturday afternoon.

‘Now we're happy to report that the brewery hosts a bustling crowd of beer enthusiasts, neighbours, tourists and all sorts of thirsty people all week long.’

Brooklyn's Artists and Fleas vintage market is open at weekends and sells jewellery, retro clothing and hand-made arts and crafts

The Artists and Fleas market at 70 North 7th Street is one of many vintage retailers springing up around Brooklyn

Yes, I know I’m slightly late to the Brooklyn party.

But such is the rapid transformation of the area, that when I last visited New York City  three years ago, the borough wasn't yet considered worthy of making it on to the itinerary.

Typically, by the time it established itself on the tourist map the trendsetters were already championing the neighbouring borough of Queens as New York’s latest hotspot.

But there’s no doubting the buzz around Williamsburg, now referred to by locals as simply The ‘Burg.

Brooklyn's lively Bedford Avenue is situated just one stop away from Manhattan's Lower East Side - or a 10-minute taxi ride over the East River

Brooklyn's restaurant of the moment is undoubtedly Roberta’s pizza parlour, situated in the shadow of the borough's former factories and warehouses

Roberta's doesn't offer reservations and diners are frequently queuing around the block to be seated

Artisan coffee shops, organic stores and flea markets have now taken the place of old factory buildings in Brooklyn

David Beckham and rapper Jay Z have already pledged their allegiance to the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, snubbing Manhattan rivals the New York Knicks.

The pair are regularly seen in the crowd at the nearby Barclays Centre arena in Boerum Hill.

Perhaps most importantly, the local food scene in Brooklyn has exploded and now ranges from the three Michelin-starred Brooklyn Fare, to experimental Japanese kitchen Okonomi, a miniature 380sq-ft foot diner hidden among the backstreets.

The rather unconventional brunch menu of seafood and ramen dishes served at its four-stool counter might not be to the taste of those who hanker after traditional New York fare offered up by the local delis, cafes and bagel shops.

But for those who like their food piled high, Sweet Chick offers classic soul food such as fried chicken, waffles and maple syrup and shrimp and grits.

Brooklyn is mostly low-rise buildings, and has a much more residential, small-town feel compared to the towering skyline and fierce pace of Manhattan

However, Brooklyn's restaurant of the moment is undoubtedly Roberta’s pizza parlour.

Set among the industrial parks and abandoned warehouses of east Williamsburg, naturally this hipster hangout is far too cool to offer reservations.

Instead, diners queuing patiently around the block is a common sight at weekends.

Arcade games from the 1980s have been installed at Barcade, while artisan coffee shops, upmarket delis, fromageries and second-hand book stores are now in plentiful supply.

Brooklyn is mostly low-rise buildings, and has a much more residential, small town feel compared to the towering skyline and fierce pace of Manhattan.

I'm told that good weather brings residents out onto their stoops, while local artists routinely set up stalls selling their fare on the sidewalks. 

Brooklyn was well off the tourist map during the 1970s, when the area was primarily a working class borough

And, of course, no cultural revolution is complete without the addition of the latest fitness fads.

It was in 2013 that the luxury indoor cycling studio Soul Cycle opened its first branch in Williamsburg.

The popular workout classes, which also have branches in LA and Manhattan, have built up an impressive celebrity following over the years and now count Tom Cruise and Lady Gaga among their most committed members.
