A rusty wreck of a Mercedes left gathering dust in a British lock-up for more than 30 years has sold for a staggering £445,000 - almost seven times its estimate.

The Mercedes 600 six-door Landaulet was the car of choice for 20th century despots with Saddam Hussein, Pol Pot and Idi Amin among notorious owners.

This 1971 model, is regarded as the 'holy grail' of Mercedes but was previously owned by an African head of state who treated the German limousine appallingly.

The Mercedes is powered by a huge 6.3-litre V8 engine which develops 245bhp. This particular engine, however, has certainly seen better days

The Mercedes later left Africa and has spent more than 30 years decaying in a lock-up until recently resurfacing to go under the hammer at RM Auctions' Paris sale.

The car was offered without reserve and with a modest estimate of £60,000 to £100,000, but bidding soon rose into the hundreds of thousands.

Offers came in from the auction room and over the phone as interested parties battled it out to get their hands on the 20-foot long limousine.

The hammer eventually went down on Wednesday night, with the car being sold for €480,000 euros (£395,000), rising to £442,400 when an anonymous buyers' premium is included.

The owner will now be left with a costly restoration which could cost in excess of £800,000.

The Mercedes 600 was the luxury car of the 1960s and 70s thanks to its high levels of comfort and state-of-the-art technology.

The classic Mercedes 600, in its various editions, remains popular today with the likes of Jeremy Clarkson and singer Jay Kay among well-known owners

At the top of the range were the 26 special 'Landaulet' models where the rear of the car would open and transform it into the world's ultimate convertible.

This made it perfect for parades and the 600 Landaulet became a favourite of some the world's most notorious leaders including Saddam Hussein and Pol Pot.

When it was delivered in 1971, it was fitted with a nine-inch Sony TV, Becker Grand Prix radio with eight speakers. It also had the comfort of optional armrests, the security of seatbelts, and the privacy of curtained windows.

This accelerates the 20-foot long limousine from 0-60mph in around ten seconds and top speed of more than 125mph.

Stuart Haynes, service director at Mercedes specialist John Haynes Auto Technics, said the £450,000 paid for the car could turn out to be a good investment.

He said: 'It was the car of the moment, anyone who was anyone had a Mercedes 600. John Lennon owned one, so did Coco Chanel and many heads of state.'

'The Mercedes 600 was the best car in the world when it was made and some people still argue it is. It is silent, smooth and quick. The presence shouts style and 'you've made it',' he added.

Mr Haynes said the 600 was 'the best of the best' and showcased the true extent of Mercedes' quality as a car manufacturer.

He believes the restoration will be particularly because of the hydraulics involved.

'You'd probably be looking at in excess of 1m euros for Mercedes to restore it. They are few and far between... Fully restored it is a difficult car to value but you are getting a brand new Mercedes 600 and it will probably be a wise investment', he said.
