For two years Florida has been infested with Giant African Land Snails, and in order to combat the pest they are now bringing in a secret weapon.

Soon the state will employ trained Labrador retrievers to fight the infestation of the snails, one of the world's most destructive invasive species.

The snails, which were spotted in the Miami area two years ago can grow as big as rats and eat both plants and building materials such as stucco and plaster.

'We see a lot of strange things in Florida and this one makes the top of the list,' Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam told Reuters. 'It is a very serious pest.'

Up to this point the state has collected 128,000 snails, the news organization reports.

The aggressive campaign has cost the state $6 million dollars so far.

Officials believe the destructive snail population may have been introduced into the area by the local Santeria religious group, who use the insects in their rituals.

In addition to harming plants, the snails pose a potential threat to humans as they can carry a parasitic rat lungworm that can induce meningitis, Reuters reports.

However state officials say that no such case have been reported in the United States.

Before the dog cavalry was brought in, efforts to find and exterminate the snails involved a team of 45 people who combed the grown in search of the slimy land pests.

The teams used chemical treatments and traps in order to find the snails.

The state is now bringing in the dogs to aid this effort

'They're very good at detecting the Giant African Land Snail,'Richard Gaskalla the head of plant industry at the Florida Agriculture Department told Reuters.. 'So we're building four-legged technology into this program as quickly as we can.'

The dogs are expected to aid the eradication efforts by sniffing out the snails.

The Giant African Land Snail gives off a strong smell which the dogs are being trained to detect.

The giant snails were first spotted in Florida two years ago and can do agricultural and structural damage

The dogs are trained over a three month period, and so far three Labradors are going through the program.

At this time the agriculture department believes that this infestation is contained to the local Miami area.

Gaskalla told Reuters that so far the state's efforts have been successful as there is a marked drop in population number since they were first discovered.

'The number of detections this last year were in the thousands; now they are down to around 200 to 300 a week,' he said.
