He's no 
stranger to selfies and has even posted a Tweet but Prince Harry 
revealed that he 'hates' Twitter while meeting teenagers in London 
today.

The
 prince was at Bethnal Green Academy in east London, where he was 
introduced to the 60 'digital media champions' lined up to help promote 
September's Invictus Games.

But the royal admitted candidly: ‘I really quite hate Twitter' as he took the opportunity to hit out at the social networking site for what he sees as its ‘invasion’ of his privacy during an impromptu Q&A.

Joking around: Harry proved a hit with students at the Bethnal Green Academy but said he 'hates' Twitter

When asked if he would be tweeting during the Games, which take place in London this September, Harry said: 'I would love to get involved and go on social media and if it was for causes like this I really would.

'The issue for myself and my family, put quite simply, is that it's very hard for me to tweet about the Invictus Games and tweet about something that means a lot to me, whereas I at the same time really quite hate Twitter by the invasion of privacy. I think you all understand what I'm talking about.’

Although Buckingham Palace and Clarence House both use social media to promote the work of the Royal Family, Harry, who is fourth in line to the throne, has often spoken of his anger at the way details or pictures of his whereabouts outside of official engagements are made public on the internet.

But it seems that not all social media is off limits, as during the visit, he admitted that he once had a Facebook account – for which he used the pseudonym Spike Wells.

Harry was meeting 60 students from six London schools taking classes at Bethnal Green Academy on how to Tweet and use Facebook and other websites as they prepare to become ‘digital champions’ for the Invictus Games.

The prince has spearheaded the event, which will be held between September 10th and 14th at the Olympic Park, and will see 400 wounded servicemen and women from 14 countries compete in everything from volleyball to archery.

Speaking off the cuff, Harry told his audience: ‘For me this is an opportunity for the British public to say thank you to these people from across the world for their service. You only hear about the guys who die, you never hear about the injuries.

‘So to give this opportunity to all these guys who have been injured and managed to survive thanks to the amazing medical care we have nowadays, I think that's a really powerful message to send to everybody. Some of them shouldn't be alive but they are.’

He told the students how he was inspired by the Warrior Games, a similar event held in the US, during a visit to Colorado in 2012 and vowed to make their concept global.

Since then he has immobilised the MOD, London Mayor and Olympics organisers to throw their weight behind the event.

During the very relaxed visit Harry sat in on three workshops at the school, at one point even taking over and asking the young people questions about why they like social media.

He posed for photographs with several of the students and encouraged them to ‘get out of the classroom’ to take pictures and tweet from Olympic locations.

After the event - and despite his disdain for the site - photos of Prince Harry flooded onto Twitter, with students telling of their delight at meeting him.

One, Sheridan Gateley, who describes himself as a 'passionate Arsenal fan and a fan of sport in general,' tweeted:

'Selfie with His Royal Highness Prince Harry. Great Day training to be a #InvictusGames Social Media Ambassador!'

Even the teachers couldn't resist getting in on the act with the staff at one sixth form college, Sir George Monoux in Waltham Forest, writing:

'So proud of our students...you were fantastic as usual!! Thank you @InvictusLondon @CitizensUK and #PrinceHarry'.
