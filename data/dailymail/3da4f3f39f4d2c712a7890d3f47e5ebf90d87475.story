By now, the incident is passably familiar. The ruck had concluded, there was a small skirmish, and without warning, Dylan Hartley of Northampton and England smashed his elbow into the side of Matt Smith’s jaw. The Leicester player collapsed, and Hartley was sent off. At which point, certain characters in rugby union began to behave extremely foolishly.

Alan Dickens, who is Northampton’s defence coach, declared that Hartley was ‘integral to our culture,’ which says something for their ‘culture’. Tom Wood, Hartley’s colleague for club and country, rallied his depleted forces with a fraudulent cry of ‘Let’s do this for Dylan!’

But worse by far was the reaction of Jim Mallinder, the club’s director of rugby. He thought the whole affair was ‘disappointing’. He ‘didn’t think there was any malice in it,’ and he criticised Smith for going down ‘pretty easily’. In summary, he declared: ‘It’s a tough game, and Dylan plays to the edge. You won’t change Dylan. He is competitive.’ He added: ‘I’m not saying that what he did was right.’

Such a short statement to contain so much specious tosh! There was the elbow thrown without ‘malice’, the casual defaming of the stricken Smith, the macho garbage about rugby being ‘a tough game’, the acceptance that the player is beyond reform, and that wonderful euphemism ‘competitive’. Belatedly, he realised the ridiculous figure he was cutting and added the risible rider: ‘I’m not saying that what he did was right.’

Now the ‘competitive’ man he was defending has a certain amount of ‘previous’: a 26-week ban for eye-gouging in 2007, eight weeks for biting in 2012, two weeks for punching in the same year, and 11 weeks for verbally abusing a referee in 2013. Hartley now has another three-week ban to add to his wretched tally, the lenient sentence apparently partly due to his plea of guilty. In fairness a not-guilty plea might have provoked laughter in court.

No matter. Hartley is now available to play in the Six Nations, if the England coach Stuart Lancaster decides to select him. To his great credit, Lancaster has never lost touch with the grass roots of the game in schools and clubs.

He is uncomfortably aware that many parents are deeply concerned about exposing their children to the physical dangers of a sport with an increasingly thuggish reputation. He is also aware that he has a responsibility to the game which far outweighs all other considerations.

Lancaster has the chance to fulfil that responsibility by informing Hartley that he has played his last game for England.

I dearly hope he takes it.
