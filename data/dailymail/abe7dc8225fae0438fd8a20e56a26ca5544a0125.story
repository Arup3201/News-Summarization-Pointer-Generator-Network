The brother of a care home worker, who could be jailed for cruelly abusing dementia sufferers, says he had to turn her in 'before she killed someone'.

Jeremy Koralewski, 28, has revealed he  lost everything after witnessing his sister, Siobhan Koralewski, terrorising  victims at the family-run Roundstone Care Home in Filey, North Yorkshire.

She was found guilty on five counts of neglect and ill-treatment when she appeared at Teeside Crown Court in November and is due to be sentenced at the end of the month.

Siobhan Koralewski, 30, was found guilty of subjecting dementia patients to physical abuse at care home

'I may have lost everything, but someone had to protect the poor old people my sister terrorised,' Mr Koralewski told the Sunday Mirror.  

He noticed a change in her behaviour a few years after their parents, Margaret and Raymond, took over the home in 2004 - where they employed him as a chef and their daughter as deputy manager.

The home housed 12 dementia patients and promised them 'specialist treatment', but the residents ended up being subject to a catalogue of horrendous physical abuse.

Mr Koralewski's partner, Jennifer Price started working at the home in March 2012 and would come home with stories of some of the things she had witnessed.

He claims she would accuse patients of faking dementia and would get angry at incontinent patients. 

But as his sister and the aunt to their five children the pair hoped it would stop.

The final straw came in July 2012 when Siobhan decided to 'take revenge' on 88-year-old resident Kenneth Pinkney after he lashed out at her 67-year-old mother. 

During the trial, the jury heard how she danced around him 'waving her breasts in his face' before hauling him out of his chair and biting him between the legs.

Ms Price told the court: 'When Siobhan was dancing around in front of him she took her top off. She had a vest top on underneath.

'She said "Do you like that you dirty old man?" She was waving her breasts around in his face.

'Siobhan pulled Mr Pinkney out of his chair by the legs. She sat on top of his stomach, holding his arms down, and started bouncing up and down on his tummy,' Ms Price continued.

Mr Koralewski said the elderly man was screaming for his daughter, as he often did when he was upset, and tried to get up. But Siobhan moved down and bit him between the legs. 

They anonymously wrote to the Care Quality Commission to ask for advice, and did not name Siobhan or the home, but the watchdog said it needed more information.

The couple were unsure what to do, and after noticing Siobhan's behaviour getting worse, they advised one patient's son to remove his father from the home after showing him the CQC letter.

The police arrived at the couple's home that night, in November 2012, and the home was closed the next day, where his sister and mother were arrested.

Mr Koralewski said: 'My mum snapped at me and my dad called me a f****** let-down. It was painful. Their first concern should have been protecting the patients, not my sister.'

During the seven day trial, the jury also heard how Siobhan forced another dementia sufferer Elizabeth Hall, to down a cocktail of the dregs of her daily tea.

When Ms Hall screamed she did not want it, the 30-year-old put a hand over her mouth and told her to 'shut up' before forcing her to move.

Ms Price told the jury she would also see Siobhan preparing mixtures of leftover drinks for Ms Hall, 59, who suffered from Down's Syndrome, learning difficulties and dementia.

She explained: 'She was making a drink of all the drinks Liz had left - three or four drinks of tea she would not drink during the day.

'Liz was crying because she did not want to drink her drinks. Siobhan put her hand over her mouth and said 'shut up'.

'Siobhan then did what she often did to get Elizabeth to move - held onto the belt of her trousers and pulled them up.

'She was like 'wedgie-ing' them so they had no option but to walk up the stairs. Elizabeth was screaming,' Ms Price added.

Prosecutor Nicholas Askins said: 'Halfway up the stairs, Elizabeth refused to walk any further.

'So Siobhan pulled her upstairs by the waist. At the top of the stairs, Elizabeth fell to the floor and curled into a ball.

'Siobhan then pushed her along the floor hard with her foot to her bedroom door.'

The court heard on another occasion, she stuffed toilet paper in her mouth to make her shut up.

Another victim was dementia sufferer Joan Normington, aged 92, who Siobhan - described as a 'Darth-Vader character' was seen to 'frogmarch' to her room on a number of occasions.

Once, she pulled Mrs Normington out of her chair by the wrist and dragged her to her room.

Margaret Koralewski, 67, was cleared of all four charges against her during the trial last month. Neither she or her husband have spoken to their son in the two years since the arrests were made.

Mr Koralewski said: 'They've lost us and their five grandchildren, but they don't seem to care.'

He concluded that he had no choice to make the decision he did and he hoped the residents are now in safe hands being 'treated with the dignity they deserve'.
