Aviation officials are investigating an embarrassing mishap that occurred when a corporate jet broke off a truck that was towing it, sending it crashing into another plane.

A Gulfstream G550 private jet that had ferried Heinz executives into Nashville International Airport on Tuesday afternoon was being towed to another location when the accident occurred.

A bar connecting the plane to the towing vehicle reportedly separated, sending the jet into a collision course with another aircraft - a Beechcraft King Air twin turbo-prop plane - that was parked.

WTVF-TV reported that the King Air jet was another corporate jet owned by Memphis-based West Air Holdings, and was due to depart Nashville about a half hour after the incident.

News footage from the area showed the King Air plane propped up against the larger Gulfstream jet, with one of its wings in the air.

There were no passengers on either plane at the time of the crash, and no injuries were reported.

Airport spokeswoman Emily Richard told The Tennessean that investigators 'are trying to figure out how the collision occurred.'

While the FAA is looking into the incident, Heinz - which is known for its condiments and '57 varieties' - promised a probe of its own.

In a statement to WTVF-TV, Heinz Company spokesman Michael Mullen said: 'Heinz is launching a thorough investigation into the incident and we are cooperating fully with the FAA and officials.

Safety is paramount at Heinz and we are taking this matter seriously.'

Repair bill: Aviation experts say that the accident likely caused more than $100,000 in damage

And while the planes may be smaller than jumbo jets, that doesn’t mean the repair bill is any cheaper.

Aviation experts told WTVF-TV that the accident likely caused more than $100,000 in damage. 

Incoming and outgoing traffic into Nashville International Airport was not affected by the mishap.
