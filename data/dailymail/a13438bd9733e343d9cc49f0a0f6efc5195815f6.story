A teacher who arrived at her primary school smelling of alcohol and laughing 'uncontrollably' has been suspended for six months.

Catrin Williams stomped around erratically and mocked the work of a pupil with learning difficulties, the General Teaching Council for Wales professional conduct hearing was told.

Teaching assistant Ceri Falshaw said the Year Two teacher turned up late for work with mud on her clothes, which she said was because she had fallen over in her garden.

When Miss Falshaw entered the classroom at Ysgol Yr Esgob, a primary school in Caerwys, Flintshire, North Wales, at 9.20am, she said Miss Williams smelled of alcohol and mouthwash and was laughing 'loudly and uncontrollably'.

Catrin Falshaw was a teacher at Ysgol Yr Esgob, a primary school in Caerwys, North Wales. A hearing heard how the teacher was laughing uncontrollably when she arrived late for work

She stomped over to a wall display and fell into the wall, before using it to prop herself up. Miss Falshaw said Miss Williams 'appeared drunk' and that she mocked the work of a pupil with learning difficulties.

Miss Falshaw added this kind of behaviour was 'most unusual' and the children in her class were 'agog' at her behaviour.

Presenting officer Lousha Bryl said Miss Williams, of Denbigh, had written a letter in which she denied turning up at the school smelling of alcohol on January 28, 2013.

She did not attend the hearing at St David’s Hotel in Ewloe, Flintshire, and was not represented.

Professional conduct committee chairman Richard Parry Jones said Miss Williams’ actions 'breached the code of conduct and practice of a registered teacher'.

Fellow teaching assistant Hayley Hannah told the hearing she let Miss Williams into the building on the morning of January 28 and could smell an 'overpowering' smell of mouthwash, which she suspected was used to conceal a smell of alcohol.

Mrs Hannah expressed her concerns to other teaching assistants, who then informed head teacher Sue Clisham.

Mrs Clisham told the hearing that as a result of the events Miss Williams was suspended pending an investigation.

She left a 'lasting smell of alcohol' in the school office when she was called in at 10.45am, Mrs Clisham said.

Mrs Clisham added that she did not feel Miss Williams should be in charge of a class or drive herself home.

An independent investigation in May found that Miss Williams had presented herself for work smelling of alcohol and attending work while still under the influence, leading to her dismissal for gross misconduct.

Williams appealed, but the dismissal was upheld, based on the seriousness of attending work smelling of alcohol. The charge of attending school while still drunk was overturned.

After yesterday’s judgment Miss Williams will not be permitted to teach anywhere in Wales for the duration of the six month suspension and must provide the General Teaching Council for Wales with a written assessment from an approved medical professional that she is medically and physically fit to teach after that time.

The assessment will specifically assess Miss Williams’ use of alcohol.

After the hearing Liz Jenkins, chairman of the school governors, said: 'We note today’s outcome which reaffirms the decision made by the school’s governing body.'
