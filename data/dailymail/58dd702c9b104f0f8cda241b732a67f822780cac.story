DNA found on a padlock chain dropped during an Occupy Wall Street protest has been linked to that discovered at the 2004 murder scene of an aspiring actress.

Julliard student Sarah Fox, 21, was dragged from a running path in a Manhattan park in broad daylight on May 19, 2004 and strangled.

Several days later, her naked body was discovered in woodland with tulip petals arranged around it.

Although there was DNA found on her pink CD player nearby, Miss Fox's killer has never been found.

Eerie connection: DNA on a chain used in a protest by Occupy Wall Street activists this year has been linked to that found at the murder scene of a young actress in 2004

On March 28 this year, Occupy Wall Street protesters poured into the Beverly Road subway station in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.

They chained open emergency gates, taped up turnstiles and posted fliers, encouraging passengers to ride for free.

The chain was left behind when the activists fled the station following the demonstration. Police made no arrests following the incidents.

The subway stop protest was made up of mainly OWS supporters along with workers from the Transport Workers Union Local 100 and the Amalgated Transit Union.

According to NBC 4 New York, NYPD investigators have linked the crime scene DNA from Miss Fox's murder to that found in the New York subway station only months ago.

However an identity had not yet been attached to the genetic code. The DNA on the chain may not have belonged to the protesters chaining the gates, sources said.

The only suspect in the case was Dimitry Sheinman, 47, who has since moved to South Africa. He was never charged in connection with the murder of the young actress.

Sheinman returned to the U.S. last month, to share information he had received from a psychic as to who really killed the young woman. He remains a suspect but has penned a book about his experiences.

Miss Fox was a promising student studying at the prestigious Julliard School of performing arts at the time of her death.
