These breathtaking pictures of the Earth from space have taken Twitter by storm after they were posted by an astronaut aboard the International Space Station.

Canadian Chris Hadfield snapped the astonishing images over the past few days to give space fans an insight into the incredible views enjoyed from 250 miles above the planet's surface.

Via the internet connection on the space station, he updates his Twitter and Google+ accounts daily with the beautiful pictures he has taken and news on the progress of the various missions and experiments he and his colleagues carry out.

'This morning, over Africa, my breath was taken away': Astronaut Chris Hadfield shared this photo on his Twitter account

'Where the Mississippi enters the Gulf of 
Mexico. The soil of America's heartland forming a vast, deep delta': The Canadian has wowed thousands with his Twitter posts

'Glaciers hiding from the summer sun in the Andes': Each of the photos posted has been accompanied by a wry comment

'It's a bird, it's a plane, it's ... a river in South America': Commander Hadfield has been tweeting since arriving on the ISS on December 21

'The centre of the action: New Orleans - I can see the Superdome! I hope you all enjoy the #Superbowl!' The 53-year-old is soon to take command of the orbital station

'This African lake is begging for me to draw a face on it. Anybody up for a photoshop challenge?' Each of the images present an entrancing view of our planet

Commander Hadfield has been taking the Twitterverse by storm from aboard the ISS since he arrived on the ISS on December 21.Â 

But the 53-year-old's accomplishments spread far beyond the field of photography.

Not only is the 53-year-old set to 
take command of the space station, but he is also preparing to jam with 
the head man of indie pop group
the Barenaked Ladies and chat with William 
Shatner in a webcast organised by the Canadian Space Agency.

These, his most recent set of pictures, were taken over the past week or so and show locations as diverse as San Francisco's glittering lights and breathtaking cloud formations over Africa.

Not all the images are labelled with their location, but each presents an entrancing view of our jewel-like planet from a vantage point few will ever be able to see it.

The first Canadian to walk in space, Commander Hadfield, 53, a former air force fighter pilot, has previously flown two Space Shuttle missions in 1995 and 2001.

'Clouds, shadows and sand, playing with my imagination': This mesmerising image was posted with no clue as to its location on Earth

'A two-dimensional fountain, a river spurting and fanning into the sea': The images have been shared by Commander Hadfield over the past week

'Back on the East Coast, the Chesapeake Bay from orbit. You can even see the causeway': The astronaut, also a singer songwriter, will jam with Ed Robertson on Friday

'In the spirit of the day: San Francisco at night - crystal clear, can even see the lights of Alcatraz from space': That's after he chats with William Shatner on Thursday

'You know you're a big dam when you a) have your own airport & b) are visible from space': The images are sent to his son Evan, who posts them online on his behalf

'Tentacles of an Andes river drain the meltwaters': These are views which few people will ever get the chance to see for themselves

Aside from his military and space career, the former farm boy also has a
strong creative streak, expressed not only through his beautiful 
photography but also as a singer-songwriter.

On Friday he will conduct an Earth-plus-space jam with the Barenaked Ladies' Ed Roberston, a fellow Canadian, to add another accomplishment to his already enviable biography.

And that comes after a chat with the original spaceship commander James T Kirk - aka William Shatner - to be broadcast online and on Twitter on Thursday.
