Located on the outskirts of an idyllic Cheshire hamlet, the once grand Cledford Hall belonged to a wealthy Victorian farmer and landowner.

But now the former mansion and an adjoining Grade II listed barn are due to undergo a £3.2million transformation into what has been described as a Butlin’s-style holiday camp for travellers.

The plans have infuriated residents in the hamlet of Cledford, near Middlewich, who claim that with other such camps in the area already they are ‘being treated like the county dustbin’.

Cheshire East council plans to turn Cledford Hall, a 200-year-old derelict building and grade II listed barn, into a toilet and shower facility for gipsies at a cost of £3.2million - locals have opposed the proposals

Council bosses, who say they are required by law to provide a transit site, want to demolish the run-down hall dating back to 1828 to provide nine transit pitches, a permanent warden’s pitch and a play area. 

The barn would become a washing and toilet block and have an office for the warden. Plans were stalled due to the Grade II listing of the hall, but the listing was cancelled after a fire three years ago. The camp has been approved by planners and will be considered by the full council next month.

Residents fighting to stop the move include builder Bob Moody, 66, who has spent £120,000 renovating his ‘dream’ retirement cottage opposite the site entrance and fears the £250,000 property and others will be left worthless.

He called the plans an ‘outrageous use of taxpayers’ money’, adding: ‘None of us can understand why the council should think it necessary to spend such a large amount of money providing a luxury Butlin’s-style holiday camp for travellers in such lovely countryside.

Bob Moody has spent around £120,000 renovating his retirement cottage and said he believes the development is a waste of council money, will devalue his home and attract more gipsies to the area 

Cledford Hall was previously listed but was taken off the register last year after a fire at the building 

‘These plans haven’t had a single letter of support and I’m led to believe there has even been an objection letter from other gipsies and travellers. 

There are already gipsy camps in the Middlewich area and it’s time some other towns bore some of this burden. We feel we are being treated like the county dustbin. My wife is devastated and can hardly talk about it.’

Neighbour Claire Bertram said: ‘The cost of the site is completely ridiculous.’ Trevor Ratcliffe, a website developer, said: ‘It’s disgusting that public money is being spent this way. The area is now becoming a travellers’ town.’

The property is part of the history of the area and dates back around 200 years but will be demolished 

Bob Moody has launched a petition opposing the development, and is pictured outside his renovated home

Councillor Don Stockton, Cheshire East Council’s cabinet member for housing, said: ‘The site is designed to reduce the number of unauthorised encampments as these have a serious impact on residents and businesses. 

'There were 81 unauthorised encampments last year and until we have a transit site in place the police cannot use their powers to move travellers on.

‘Local authorities have a duty to make every effort to bring dilapidated listed buildings back into use.’ 

Mr Moody said he has traveled several hundred miles in search of the perfect materials for his Victorian home

Villagers in Cledford have branded the cost of the scheme, likened to a Butlins holiday park, as ridiculous 

The development was first proposed after a fire at the 19th century building destroyed the interior
