She's gone to greater lengths than most to find the secret to eternal youth, embarking on torturous diets and extreme beauty treatments to keep the years at bay.

But such dedication seems to be taking its toll on Anna Friel who looked startlingly gaunt on the red carpet this week.

The 37-year-old actress’s hollow face and painfully thin frame were in stark contrast to the fuller figure and dimpled cheeks she showed off at a film premiere several years ago.

This week she covered up in a  jumper in the chilly weather to attend a London screening of World Wide Fund For Nature's environmental documentary which she stars in.

Earlier this year Miss Friel told how she had adopted a crash diet in a bid to stay youthful-looking, which involved replacing solid food with 12 cups a day of  a cocktail of maple syrup, cayenne pepper and lemon juice.

She said: ‘I feel so much better and my skin has really benefited.

‘If you’re vain, as you get older you start thinking, “I’ve got to do everything I can to save my skin”.

'I've tried everything.'

Also dubbed a ‘master cleanse’, Miss 
Friel was reported to have undergone the diet for two months and would 
have been consuming less than 600 calories a day.

Miss Friel, best-known for her roles in Brookside and US TV series Pushing Daisies, has also confessed to having regular £600 ‘vampire’ facials, which involve taking blood from the arm and re-injecting it into areas of the face affected by wrinkles.

She also spends another £490 on a 
cryoderm treatment which uses a machine shaped like a hairdryer which is
 run gently over skin in a massaging motion using a high frequency 
electric field which heats the skin, stimulating the production of 
collagen and improving muscle tone.

Miss Friel attended the screening with her eight-year-old daughter Gracie from her relationship with Harry Potter actor David Thewlis. She is currently dating actor Rhys Ifans, 46, of Notting Hill fame.

World Wide Fund for Nature sees Miss Friel highlight her quest to protect Africa’s oldest national park, Virunga, from the threat of oil exploration.
