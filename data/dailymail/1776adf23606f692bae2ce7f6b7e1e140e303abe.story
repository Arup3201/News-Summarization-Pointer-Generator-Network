These dramatic pictures show the moment robbers armed with crowbars burst into a family home.

Chris Rustage, 38, was watching TV with his wife and three children when the pair burst through their front door of their Manchester home.

Shouting obscenities, the thieves threatened the terrified family with the crowbars, demanding the keys to the black Audi S3 parked in the drive.

Threatening: Shouting obscenities, the thieves threatened the terrified family with the crowbars, demanding the keys to the black Audi S3 parked in the drive

Mr Rustage, who owns the Ironing Shop in Didsbury, said: 'It was just such a total shock.

'You never expect something like that to happen so we were completely off guard.

'I thought it was my eldest at first, making a racket then I saw the guy in the doorway.

Robber: The footage shows one offender get out of what appears to be a black Vauxhall Corsa and run up the drive

Caught on camera: The footage shows the raid at around 8pm on Thursday lasted just 20 seconds

'I
backed off a bit then he burst in. I weighed up the situation and when I
saw there were two of them and they had crowbars, I just told him where
the keys were.

'It just left us all in shock and there was definitely an element of fear.

'It’s upsetting that my three-year old was in the room as well. He should never have had to witness something like that.

'It’s
going to have an effect for a while to come I think. We’re lucky no one
was hurt as they came equipped for violence and struck me as the kind 
of people who wouldn’t be afraid to use it.

Intimidated: The gang fled in the £25,000 car which had been bought just two months ago, leaving Chris, his wife Paula, 33, and sons Sam, 13, Joseph, 11 and Zac, three, badly shaken

'But we are all OK and that is the main thing. We’re just really angry about it now and want to see them caught.'

The
footage shows one offender get out of what appears to be a black 
Vauxhall Corsa and try the door handle of the house on Wilmslow Road, 
near to Parrs Wood.

Realising it is open, he then beckons over a second offender wearing a balaclava before they enter the house together.

Traumatic experience: Chris and Paula Rustage with sons, Joseph, 11, (left) and Sam, 13

They are inside just 20 seconds before leaving with the keys and driving off.

Mr Rustage has now released the footage in a bid to catch the thieves.

His dad, also called Chris, has also put a £1,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the robbers.

Chris junior, said the incident had left his family badly shaken.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police confirmed they were investigating the incident.
