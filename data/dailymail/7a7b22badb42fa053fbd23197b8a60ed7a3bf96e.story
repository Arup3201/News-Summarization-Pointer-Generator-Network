While shop mannequins in the UK were criticised recently for being too thin, a window display in Venezuela is attracting a different kind of controversy by featuring pregnant children.

Three dummies have been placed in a shopping mall in Caracas showing children with bulging stomachs dressed in over-sized school uniforms as part of a 'back to school' display.

The figurines were designed by two children's charities attempting to raise awareness of the country's child pregnancy rate, which is among the highest in South America.

Problem: Two children's charities teamed up to produce the shocking display, which is designed to highlight Venezuela's child pregnancy rate which is among the highest in South America

Disgust: The designers say that while some people praise the mannequins for drawing attention to the problem of child pregnancy, others have complained 

One schoolgirl under the age of 18 becomes pregnant every three minutes, while 23 per cent of all births fall into the under-18s category, according to the charities.

Auriselvia Torrealba, 20, a student who passed the mannequins, said: 'Yes, it's disturbing to see in a window. But it's the truth. 

'You see pregnant girls all the time on the streets. So this forces you to think about the problem, doesn't it?'

But her friend Kelly Hernandez, 18, disagreed, adding: 'I think it's horrible, awful. If I was a mother, I wouldn't want my child to see that.'

Venezuela's socialist government insists that education and children's rights have improved greatly since it came to power 15 years ago.

However charities and non-government organisations say that not enough is being done to educate children about sex, and that parents also need to take the issue more seriously.

That is why charities Fundana and Construyendo Futuros decided to launch their latest campaign, and say they are delighted with the controversy it has attracted.

Shock: One girl under the age of 18 becomes pregnant every three minutes in Venezuela, while a quarter of all births in the country fall into that age group, according to the charities

Thalma Cohen, president of Construyendo Futuros, said: 'It's amazing seeing people react as they walk by. This is such a taboo subject in Venezuela, we want people to talk about it. 

'Some people get angry and complain. Others congratulate us.'

The mannequins will be on display for the next month and may be taken to other malls around the nation of 30million people.

It comes days after a United Nations women's rights watchdog expressed 'deep concern' over Venezuela's high number of teenage pregnancies and maternal mortality.

According to the most recent U.N. data, Venezuela had an adolescent birth rate of 101 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19, one of the highest in Latin America, in 2010.

For every 100,000 live births that took place, 92 women died in labour. The risks to adolescent mothers of death or serious injury is significantly higher than women in their late teens or twenties.
