A seven-year-old girl was flung through a car window during a 70mph motorway crash - but escaped completely unharmed.

Ysabelle Amos was in her father's partner's car on Sunday when a tyre blew out on the M55 near Kirkham, Lancashire, hurling the Daewoo Matiz into the central reservation and sending it into a spin.

Her father's partner Tracy Jenkinson, 42 - who also had her two children Charlie and Chelsea Piggot in the back - managed to swerve onto the hard shoulder without hitting any other cars.

But when she turned around to check on the children, she realised one was missing.

Ysabelle had flown through a rear window after it shattered and landed in the middle of the motorway.

Ms Jenkinson said: 'The kids were screaming Ysabelle’s name and really panicking.

'I looked around and just saw her pop up between the barriers of the central reservation. She was standing where she was safe.

'Some of the drivers who had stopped on the motorway brought her across the lanes, and she didn’t have a scratch on her.'

Incredibly, none of the children were hurt other than minor cuts and bruises and Ms Jenkinson suffered only a bruised elbow.

The motorway was shut in both directions at around 6pm as the North West Air Ambulance landed on the carriageway to take Ysabelle to Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool, as a precaution.

Charlie, nine, and Chelsea, eight, were taken to Royal Preston Hospital and later transferred to Manchester Children’s Hospital.

All three were allowed home the next day.

Ms Jenkinson, a beauty salon owner from St Annes, Lancashire, said: 'When we set off all three children were in the back and had their seat belts on.

'Ysabelle doesn’t know what happened and how she came to be outside the car, but I think she must have panicked and took her seatbelt off as the car started to shake.

'As we hit the central reservation and the back window came out she went through it.

'After that the car was all over the place. I was trying to slow but the brakes weren’t working as well as they should have.

'I remember thinking "we’re not going to survive this".

'I asked the angels to look after the children. I didn’t care if I made it, as long as they were safe.'
