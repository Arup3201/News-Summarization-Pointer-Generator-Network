One Yankee drugs cheat stole the spotlight from another on the day he announced his retirement.

In a sequence of events almost too bizarre to be true, Alex Rodriguez hit his 24th career grand slam to pass Yankee legend Lou Gherig on the all-time list and set a new record only hours after admitted drugs cheat Andy Pettitte announced his retirement from baseball.

Despite all three holding major records and having Hall of Fame caliber careers, only one was never called a cheat – and he wasn’t in pinstripes Friday night.

Alone at the top: Alex Rodriguez watches his record-breaking home run

Up to the plate with the bases loaded in a tie game in the bottom of the seventh inning, Alex Rodriguez mashed the first pitch he saw from reliever George Kontos for a grand slam home run.

The shot was his 24th career home run with the bases loaded, passing Lou Gherig (who has 23 such homers) to go into first all-time.

It also gave the Yankees a badly needed 5-1 victory over the defending World Series Champion San Francisco Giants.

A-Rod has a penchant for stealing others’ spotlights. In 2004, during the middle of the first World Series won by the Boston Red Sox since 1918, the shamed slugger shocked the sport by opting out of his then-record $250milloin contract with the Bronx Bombers.

Only hours before, Mr Pettite announced his second retirement from baseball. Having retired after the 2010 season to spend more time with his family, the admitted HGH user came out of retirement prior to the 2012 season.

Mr Pettite pitched 15 of his 18 seasons with the Yankees, the other three with his hometown Houston Astros. His 255 career wins place him among the all-time greats, but it's his playoff resume that turns heads.

With 19 postseason wins, he is the career leader – by a wide margin. These wins were against great teams playing at their peaks, remarkable by any measure.

He is considered one of the greatest pitchers of his era, but will never make it to the Hall of Fame – instead eventually fading into obscurity with Mr Rodriguez.

After admitting to using HGH during the 2004 season to heal an elbow injury, Pettitte likely sealed his fate despite having better career number than several pitchers enshrined in the Hall.

Never needed help: Lou Gherig never used drugs, and played until ALS - eventually named after him - robbed him of the strength needed to play, and then eventually his life

While Pettitte has been allowed to go out on his own terms, Alex Rodriguez still has a legal battle ahead of him. 

An arbitrator’s hearing scheduled for Sept 29 looms large, and could force him into retirement whether he’s ready or not. A 39-year-old fading slugger suspended for 211 games does not return to baseball. 

While Pettitte’s story comes to an end, Rodriguez’s is long from over.
