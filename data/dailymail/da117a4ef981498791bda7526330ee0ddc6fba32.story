You might intend it as a way to demonstrate humour or add emphasis to a word.

But chances are that using your fingers to create speech marks as you talk is sending out an altogether different – and unintended – message.

For the sign has been voted the hand gesture most likely to irritate us.

Irritating: A model performs the 
inverted speech marks hand gesture intended to display irony. It was voted the most annoying nonverbal communication of all time

Talk to the hand! The Americanism was voted the second most annoying gesture, while the 'none of your business' nose-tapping sign was the third most irritating

Blah, blah, blah: Making an imaginary mouth with the hand is the fourth most annoying thing to do when talking with people, according to a survey of 2,000 people

Second place in the poll – which 
didn’t include obscene gestures – was the American-style ‘talk to the 
hand’ signal, intended to stop someone speaking to you.

Others guaranteed to make the blood 
boil were putting a finger to the nose to depict ‘none of your business’
and ‘blah blah blah’, where people touch their thumb and forefinger to 
imitate a chatty mouth.

Rounding off the top five was ‘the pistol’ – where two fingers and thumb are used to form a gun.

The research found that a quarter of us actively try to stop ourselves using gestures.

But not all hand signals received the 
metaphorical thumbs down. Wiggling an imaginary pint glass to ask for a 
drink or shushing someone with a finger to your lips were seen as 
useful.

It was also found that the average 
person uses four hand gestures a day, yet one in five feel embarrassed 
at how often they rely on them.

Firing an imaginary pistol was voted fifth most galling of all hand signals, while punching a palm to indicate violence was the sixth most annoying

I'm watching you: Signalling to people that they're being watched has been voted the seventh most annoying gesture

Call me: Although it's used regularly, putting a thumb and pinkie finger to the face to tell somebody to call is the eight most annoying hand gesture

Boring! Pretending to yawn to implicate boredom was voted the ninth most annoying hand signal. The rather menacing cut-throat gesture was tenth most unpleasant

More than a third of the study of 
2,000 people said they were less likely to trust those who use too many 
hand gestures, while more than half admitted becoming annoyed at someone
who talks with their hands too much.

The most irritating gestures also 
included the traditional ‘call me’ motion, where the hand is used to 
represent a phone; putting the fingers to the eyes to signify ‘I’m 
watching you’; ‘zip it,’ where a person pretends to zip up their mouth 
to tell someone to stop talking; and rubbing fingers and thumb together 
to denote cash.

A spokesman for iPhone game Goggle 
Eyes, which commissioned the research, said: ‘While a hand gesture can 
be a powerful communication tool, using too many or simply some of the 
more annoying ones is a sure-fire way to losing credibility.

‘Most of the more irritating gestures 
originated out of a need to communicate quickly and transcend language 
barriers – but it doesn’t take much for a gesture to seem cheesy or 
informal.

‘It’s about being able to recognise 
how to use gestures and for which audiences – sometimes they’re funny 
and entertaining but, often, they’re just annoying.’

Many of us sign our emails and text messages with X, for a kiss – but we are making our colleagues uncomfortable.

Some 44 per cent of people said receiving virtual kisses from co-workers was awkward.

But one in four said they felt obliged to return the sign of affection, according to a survey for  National Kissing Day by mobile network Three.

And 15 per cent of people confessed to sending at least one X to their boss, with 1 per cent putting eight or more.

Etiquette expert William Hanson said: ‘You should only put a kiss if you would kiss them in real life.’
