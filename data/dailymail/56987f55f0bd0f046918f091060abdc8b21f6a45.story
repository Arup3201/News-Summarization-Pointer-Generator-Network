At least one man was keeping his fingers crossed that the
world would end today.

Martin Muller was set to make £50,000 after placing a £10
wager on the coming of the apocalypse with betting firm Paddy Power.

The 26-year-old, from London, made the bizarre bet at odds of 5,000-1
 after hearing of the Mayan Prophecy that the world would be destroyed, or changed, today at 11.11am (GMT).

Wager: Martin Muller was set to make £50,000 after placing a £10 bet with Paddy Power that the world was going to end today - at odds of 5,000-1

He made the bet with friend Rob Moss after telling him there was more chance of the world ending than his bicycle courier business being a success.

Mr Muller said: 'I told Rob there was more chance of the world ending than his company getting off the ground.

'So I thought as a joke I'd make the bet, I'd heard of the Mayan prophecy about December 21 being the apocalypse so thought what have I got to lose?'

Bet: The bicycle courier, 26, has admitted that spending his winnings would have been difficult if the 'Mayan Prophecy' which predicts the apocalypse, had come true today

Mr Muller's prediction for the business has already proved inaccurate as
the courier service has proved so successful he has joined up himself.

Paddy Power is also offering a 1,000-1 on bet ‘with a
maximum of £10' that the sun will rise tomorrow.

The Mayan Prophecy 
is based on the Maya calendar, which counts the days since the 'last 
creation' (on or about 11 August, 3114BC).

Today marks the same number of days once again, and believers feared the reset of the calender will mean the end of the world.

However, experts say that it is unclear whether the Maya themselves actually agreed on this.

The prediction nevertheless 
caused panic among believers, with thousands of people 
stockpiling food and even creating special shelters to survive the Earth's 'destruction.'

So many people
called NASA to vent their anxieties that the US space agency set up a 
special website to help dispel the 'myth,' according to the Daily Star.

Meanwhile believers in the 
prophecy also headed for the French village of Bugerach in the foothills of the Pyrenees in the belief that
it will be spared in the apocalypse.

Cult followers are said to
believe aliens live inside the mountain the village stands on and 
will spare any humans who leave the planet with them when the world 
ends.

Police were forced to control entry to the village as a result, the Star reports.

Belief: Mayan priests place flowers for a ceremony in Tecpan, Guatemala. The Mayan calendar cycle prompted a wave of fear among believers across the globe

Safety: French police controlled entry to the village of Bugarach in the foothills of the Pyrenees which some believed was the best place on Earth to survive the predicted apocalypse
