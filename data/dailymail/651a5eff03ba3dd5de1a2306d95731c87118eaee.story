Rapist footballer Ched Evans's girlfriend has quit Twitter after she was branded a 'gold-digger' and 'disgusting' for standing by him despite his conviction.

Evans, a striker for Sheffield United and Wales, could be released from prison today having served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl in his home town of Rhyl.

The case has sparked huge controversy following comments by ITV star Judy Finnigan in which she suggested the 25-year-old should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was 'drunk' and the rape was 'unpleasant' but 'not violent'.

Her comments, and the possibility he could return to professional football, has caused outrage - an online petition opposing his return  has now gathered almost 150,000 signatures.

But yesterday Evans girlfriend 25-year-old Natasha Massey, who remains convinced of her boyfriend's innocence, quit Twitter after receiving a torrent of abuse from trolls.

The Sun reported she closed her account after she was called 'disgusting', a 'gold-digger' and an 'embarrassment'.

Meanwhile Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, has also waded into the debate saying that Sheffield United should 'think really long and hard' about re-signing the rapist striker.

He warned club bosses they cannot 'wish away' the Evans' rape conviction and must remember that the players are not just footballers but role models to millions of fans. 

Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg told LBC: 'I think the owners need to think really long and hard about that fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days you are also taking on a role model.

'You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on the football pitch on a team like that, and he has committed a very, very serious crime.' 

To the fury of thousands of people, the club's manager Nigel Clough revealed on Wednesday officials had discussed bringing the striker back following his release from prison.

This morning almost 150,000 people had signed a petition requesting Sheffield United did not resign Evans.

The controversy erupted after Judy Finnegan, during her debut as a panellist on Loose Women this week, suggested Evans should be allowed to go back to the club.

After a huge backlash about the remarks branded 'disgusting' and 'damaging', she was eventually forced to 'apologise unreservedly' for the offence she had caused.

However her daughter Chloe has since been viciously trolled online. Yesterday it was revealed police are investigating after a Twitter user told the 27-year-old, that her mother had given her 'blessing' for her to be raped.
