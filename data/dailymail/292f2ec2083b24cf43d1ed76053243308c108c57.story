A principal who works at an elementary school where only 12 percent of students can pass math exams diverted school funds towards a personal gym, it has been claimed.

Principal Jazmine Santiago of PS 269 in Flatbush, Brooklyn allegedly bought gym equipment, including a bench press, pull-up bar, treadmill, elliptical machine and thigh exerciser. 

One source told the New York Post. told said that when confronted by other staff at the school, Santiago claimed the workout machines were shared with older students.

With the oldest at the school only in fifth grade, much of the equipment would be too big to be suitable for students.

'Their bodies are not ready for a treadmill,' one teacher said. 

Teachers said that the workout machines were kept out of sight in a third-floor room that Santiago, who earns $124,319 a year, kept locked and off limits to both students and staff.

'She comes in early, she goes to the gym,' another teacher said. 

'Even when class is in session, she’s still in the gym.'

'The kids have their own gym,' the teacher added. 'Her gym is on the third floor and it’s her own personal gym.'

The room was converted from a storage room to be used as a gym in June 2014 without discussion with other faculty at the school, sources told the Post.

NBC reports that New York's Department of Education will launch a probe into the allegations.

'School funds should only be used to help develop a supporting learning environment,' a spokesman for the agency said. 

'We take any allegation that funds were used inappropriately seriously,' the spokesperson added. 

Santiago has been in charge of PS 269 for four years. Last year, only 16 percent at the school passed the state's English tests, while only 12 passed in math.
