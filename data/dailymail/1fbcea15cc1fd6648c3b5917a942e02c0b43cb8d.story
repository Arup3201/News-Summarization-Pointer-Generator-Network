Brazil striker Fred says he was clearly fouled in the move that led to a controversial penalty in favour of the hosts during the opening match of the World Cup.

Speaking publicly for the first time after Brazil's 3-1 win on Thursday in Sao Paulo, Fred said in a video released by the Brazilian football federation that 'it was a clear penalty.'

He said in the clip that 'there was a charge' by the Croatian defender on his shoulder, and that kept him from having a chance to score.

Innocence plea: Fred has claimed this foul by Dejan Lovren in Brazil's World Cup opener with Croatia, leading to Neymar's goal for 2-1, was a 'clear penalty'

Appeal: Fred, sat on the ground, pleads with referee Yuichi Nishimura for a penalty

Pursuit: Croatia players chase after Nishimura after he points to the penalty spot as Fred remains seated on the turf

Television replays show there was minimal contact by the defender before Fred fell, but Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura gave the penalty and Neymar converted the 71st-minute penalty to give Brazil a 2-1 lead.

Neymar had earlier drawn the hosts level after Marcelo put through his own net to give Croatia a surprise early lead.

Oscar added a late third to make sure of victory for Brazil but Croatia were further riled when they had a late reply disallowed after Ivica Olic was adjudged to have fouled goalkeeper Julio Cesar.

Croatia coach Niko Kovac was furious at the referee's performance afterwards, claiming he should never have been appointed to such an important fixture.

'If that's a penalty, then we can just stop playing football right now,' said Kovac after the final whistle in Sao Paulo.

'Let's play basketball instead. It's shameful. We talk about respect, but there wasn't any respect for Croatia.

'If that's how we start the World Cup, then we may as well give up and go home now.'

He added: 'I must say the referee was completely out of his depth. If someone's not up to scratch to referee the first game then find someone else. Two-and-a-half billion people saw this wasn't a penalty.'

Kovac also claimed that Nishimura was a 'bad choice' for the match because he had sent off Felipe Melo in Brazil's 2-1 defeat to Holland in the 2010 World Cup quarter-final.
