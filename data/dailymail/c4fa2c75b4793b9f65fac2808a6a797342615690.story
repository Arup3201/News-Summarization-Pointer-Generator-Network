An ex Queensland health employee has broken down in court after being sentenced to two years prison after stealing nearly $40,000 in overtime.

36-year-old Karma Elms faced the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday and pleaded guilty to the offence before becoming defensive about the course of events.

Magistrate Wendy Cull handed down the two-year prison sentence which is to be suspended after three months saying that the fraudulent behaviour was planned and systematic.

36-year-old Karma Elms has been sentenced to 2 years jail after stealing nearly $40,000 in overtime 

The offence saw 36-year-old, Karma Elms scam the Health department out of $39,352 over 15 months.

According to the Magistrate, Elms showed a 'degree of defensiveness' despite pleading guilty and made note of the fact that she had travel a long way to get to work.

She has not yet repaid the debt and is on the brink of bankruptcy after spending all of the stolen funds on credit cards, rent and gift hampers.

'Clearly you are a poor manager of your personal finances and have spent money that far exceeded your income,' The ABC reported Magistrate Cull said.

Elms was hired by Queensland health in 2010 to help with the large workload after the department's flawed payroll system was introduced that left 1800 employees with little or no pay.

The Caboolture woman pleaded guilty to the charges and is still to repay the $39,352 as she has spent it all

The court was told that the Caboolture woman may have been suffering from anxiety from work demands

Magistrate Cull told the court that Elms had a disadvantaged childhood with an abusive stepfather who she escaped at the end of high school and now supports her mother.

Despite her background and a glowing reference from her new employer, the Magistrate said she had swindled money that she had no right to.

Elms' lawyer, Mark Williams said she is apologetic about her actions and has rejected the idea that she wished to refute the charges.

The Crime and Corruption Commission hope to use Elms as an example to other public servants.

'It is totally unacceptable that public money was diverted from other essential health services which should benefit all Queenslanders,' acting director Paxton Booth said.

'If public sector employees defraud the Government, they can expect to be caught and prosecuted.'
