No campaigners last night lit up three of Scotland's most famous tourist attractions with a clear message about which way the electorate should vote today. 

A large No was projected onto Edinburgh Castle, Stirling Castle and the Armadillo in Glasgow in an audacious last-minute public relations stroke.

The 50 foot high message was shone on the rocky outcrop below Edinburgh castle around 10pm as the people of Scotland deliberate the future of the United Kingdom.

Pro Union campaigners projected a large No onto the hill below Edinburgh Castle late last night 

A similar light display was shone on the side of Stirling Castle by anti-independence campaigners 

Even in Glasgow, members of the no campaign managed to shine their message on the Armadillo

Last night, nobody from the Labour Party or the Better Together Campaign was in a position to confirm whether they were responsible for the publicity stunt. 

Labour leader Ed Miliband posted an image of the Edinburgh Castle display on his Twitter feed which was retweeted more than 500 times within three hours of his message.

One source said: 'I don't want to say too much about it. I can't tell you who was behind the show as they do not want that information getting out.' 

The concept is called Projection Bombing where a powerful light beam - sometimes featuring lasers is broadcast on an iconic building or structure. 

It can also be used in guerrilla advertising campaigns although the legality of the stunts has been questioned.

In October 2010 Westminster Council threatened legal action against Cricket Australia who beamed a message on the side of Big Ben taunting the England cricket team.  

In 1999 Big Ben was targeted with a naked image of television presenter Gail Porter beamed across it.

Later Yes campaigners attempted to recreate the earlier stunt although the images were not as impressive
