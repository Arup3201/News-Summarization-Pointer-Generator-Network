Mitt Romney has attempted to shift attention away from the controversy over when he truly left Bain Capital by accusing Barack Obama of favouring political donors with government contracts in a form of cronyism that ‘stinks to high heaven’.

Appearing on Fox News, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said: ‘This is a tough time for the people of America. But if you’re a campaign contractor to Barack Obama, your business may stand to get millions or hundreds of millions in cash from the government.'

In a conference call with reporters, Romney advisers said they were gathering examples of Mr Obama's ‘Chicago-style politics’ to prove to voters there was an insidious ‘pattern’ of contracts being awarded to donors.

The Romney campaign also released a new internet ad using a clip of Mr Obama singing Al Green's Let's Stay Together to insinuate suggest ties between donors and the Obama administration. It was also a retort to an Obama television commercial featuring Mr Romney's off-key rendition of America the Beautiful.

Ed Gillespie, a senior Romney aide, said: ‘There are countless examples of this over the past three and a half years, whether it’s the Department of Energy or the stimulus bill, or the Department of Health and Human services and the Obamacare bill, and over the course of the next few days we're going to be highlighting some of these examples of how the Obama economy works.’

The Romney campaign has highlighted Solyndra, a California solar energy company that went bankrupt, and Westly Group, a venture capital firm whose affiliated companies have received federal loans and grants. Steve Westly, the company's founder, is a major Obama campaign fundraiser.

But the Romney campaign said it would not release details of its campaign ‘bundlers’, as Mr Obama has done. The decision provides further ammunition to Democrats, who have accused Mr Romney of a lack of transparency.

Mr Romney has said he will not release any tax returns beyond those for 2010, which have already been made public, and 2011, which are still being finalised, despite pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to do so.

Mr Gillespie told Laura Ingraham, a conservative talk radio host, that the Obama focus on Bain was designed to distract from the President’s poor economic record.

‘What we’re seeing here is what Barack Obama warned about in 2008 in his acceptance speech in Denver, when he said, you know, when you don’t have anything to run on, you try to make big elections about small things.’

Pressed on the issue of tax returns, Mr Gillespie said that Mr Romney wasn’t budging. ‘He’s releasing 2010 and 2011 and we’re happy to talk about those.

‘But the fact is what we really want to talk about are the Romney plans for creating jobs in our economy, for turning this economy around, getting it moving again, stopping the excessive regulation, the mandates and the onslaught of taxes and debt. That’s what the American people want to talk about and the constant effort to hold up shiny objects and distractions – we’re going to keep focused on what the voters care about and what matters to them.

‘It’s not Mitt Romney’s tax returns. It’s their tax returns and are they able to have income to file a tax return? Do they have a job? We have over half a million people – fewer Americans working today than when Barack Obama took office.’

Mr Romney has found himself on the defensive over federal documents filed by Bain Capital that conflicted with his statements about when he left Bain Capital.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2001, Bain Capital listed Mr Romney as the company's ‘sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president’. It said Mr Romney's ‘principal occupation’ was as Bain's managing director.

Mr Romney's campaign, backed up by a number of independent fact checkers, has repeatedly said Mr Romney had almost nothing to do with the company's operations after February 1999, when he began work on the imperilled 2002 Winter Olympic Games.

The significance of the period from 1999 to 2001 is that it covers the time when Bain oversaw investments that either sent jobs abroad or filed for bankruptcy. It is also when Mr Romney stated in federal disclosure forms that he was not active in Bain Capital.

Mr Romney has said that neither Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, nor Senator John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, released more than a years' worth of tax returns as candidates.

But the Obama campaign has been successful in making Mr Romney’s estimated wealth of at least $250million a key focus of the campaign, for the time being at least.

Mr Romney also faces difficulties explaining his secrecy over his tax returns because his father Governor George Romney of Michigan released 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968.
