Alec Baldwin's stalker is in trouble again after she was allegedly seen lurking outside the actor's home again - just months after being released from jail on Riker's Island.

Police tell MailOnline one of Baldwin's assistants spotted Genevieve Sabourin, 42, and called the cops about 9am on Friday. 

By the time officers arrived, she was gone. 

The French-Canadian actress could be arrested and sent back to jail for violating a no-contact order that prohibits her from going anywhere near Baldwin and his family. 

The NYPD says she is being sought for questioning on stalking allegations. 

Neither Baldwin nor his wife Hilaria have given public comment on the stalker's latest alleged appearance at their home in Manhattan's Greenwich Village.

Years of the actress's stalking culminated last November with Sabourin being sentenced to six months in jail for stalking and harassing Baldwin and his wife Hilaria.

She received an additional 30 days for contempt of court, according to People.

'Your relentless and escalating campaign of threats and in-person appearances in private spaces served at a minimum to harass, annoy and alarm Mr. Baldwin,' Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Robert Mandelbaum said in court last year before finding her guilty on all counts including harassment, aggravated harassment, stalking, and attempted criminal contempt, according toNew York Daily News. 

Cops: Things escalated to a critical point when Sabourin showed up at Baldwin's home in April 2012 and Hilaria (above) called the cops on her

The two reportedly met during a movie shoot back in 2000, and one decade later, Baldwin took Sabourin out to dinner and gave her career advice as a 'favor to a friend,' he told the court, People reports.

That friend was 'Scarface' producer Martin Bregman. Bregman claimed that Baldwin was cheating on Hilaria with Sabourin which Baldwin denies.

Sabourin said that Baldwin took her on a 'dream date' that ended in a sexual encounter and many empty promises made by Baldwin. Instead, Baldwin dropped her. 

Begged: Over the next few years, Sabourin would maintain a phone and email relationship.  Baldwin said he would send friendly emails but also begged her to leave him and his family alone

Claims: Sabourin claims that Baldwin took her to dinner in 2010 and the two had a sexual encounter in a hotel afterward

Over the next few years, Sabourin would maintain a phone and email relationship, according to People. Baldwin said he would send friendly emails but also begged her to leave him and his family alone.

Things escalated to a critical point when Sabourin showed up at Baldwin's home in April 2012 and Hilaria called the cops on her, according to the Daily News. 

It seems that since their 2010 dinner, Baldwin has been unable to rid Sabourin. It seems that neither a restraining order nor jail time is enough to keep away this woman scorned.
