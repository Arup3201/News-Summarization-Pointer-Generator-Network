'Princess': Lia Green was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital after she began feeling unwell at her parents' home

A 21-year-old mother has been charged with causing or allowing the death of her three-year-old daughter, who was found with serious injuries to her internal organs.

Natalie Critchley and her partner Richard Green, 22, called an ambulance to their £90,000 terraced home in Preston, Lancashire, after their daughter Lia Green began feeling unwell.

Paramedics fought to save her life, but the toddler was pronounced dead on arrival at Royal Preston Hospital.

Richard Green was 
charged in October with her murder and later remanded in custody.

He is 
due to attend a plea and case management hearing at Preston Crown Court 
on January 14.

Shocked neighbours of the couple spoke 
of their disbelief after Lia's death and said they used to call her a 
‘little princess’ because of her pretty face and lovely smile.

Lia's mother, Natalie Critchley, appeared at Preston Magistrates' Court this morning and was remanded in custody to appear at Preston Crown Court on Friday at 10am for a preliminary hearing.

Lancashire Police said a 22-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice has been released from his bail and will face no further action.

‘We are going to continue to speak to people who knew Lia such as family members and friends.

‘The main focus of our enquiries are the injuries and to determine how she got her injuries,’ police said.

Tragedy: Critchley, right, and Green called 999 and said they feared Lia was deteriorating quickly

Det Supt Dermott Horrigan, from Lancashire’s Force Major Investigation Team, said: ‘This is an incredibly complex and sensitive inquiry and we have a team of highly trained and professional officers looking into the matter.

‘The death of a child will always be greeted with shock and a deep sense of sadness.'

One said they would often see Lia playing in the street and added: ‘She was often called the little princess because she had such a fair face and lovely blonde hair and a lovely smile. It’s such a tragedy and everyone is in utter shock.’

The couple, who are thought to be engaged, were arrested and questioned for up to four days by police.
