Manchester United left it late at the Hawthorns to deny West Brom a famous home win against Louis van Gaal's stuttering side.

Stephane Sessegnon fired the hosts into the lead with his first goal this season, however Manchester United equalised early in the second half. Much maligned midfielder Marouane Fellaini came on at the break to score a spectacular equaliser within minutes of the restart. 

Saido Berahino broke clear of United's shaky backline to send the Baggies ahead again, but summer signing Daley Blind denied them the three points with a low strike with just three minutes left of play.

WEST BROM (4-2-3-1)

Boaz Myhill was making his first appearance in the Premier League since December 2013 on Monday night

Boaz Myhill - 7

His first Premier League start in 10 months went well. He made a decent save from Van Persie, then twice denied Angel di Maria. No chance with Fellaini’s thunderbolt. 

Andre Wisdom - 7

Showed a calm head to pick out Sessegnon for his goal and worked tirelessly up and down the right flank. Not only did he provide an attacking outlet but a solid defensive screen.

Craig Dawson - 7

West Brom rejected two bids from Burnley in the summer and the former England Under 21 international is beginning to show why. From fourth-choice centre back to vital member of the team. 

Centre back Joleon Lescott failed to prevent Marouane Fellaini scoring at the start of the second-half

Joleon Lescott - 7

Out-muscled by Fellaini for his goal, but provided plenty more to counter-balance. There were timely interceptions to crosses and a calm authority to his play. Expert organiser too. 

Sebastien Pocognoli - 6

Dependable as usual at left-back without doing much spectacular. Has been the only foreign summer signing to feature in Alan Irvine’s team consistently and he does provide balance. 

Craig Gardner - 7

Threw himself in front of shots as the minutes ticked down and provided a solid core to West Brom’s team. Restricted his running forward to ensure the hosts maintained their shape. 

James Morrison - 6

Did not quite have the impact of recent games, where he has been one of Albion’s best players, but did all the basics well.

West Brom midfielder, shielding off Luke Shaw, worked tirelessly for the home side on the right wing

Graham Dorrans - 7.5

Full of energy and clever link-up play throughout. Prepared to work hard for the cause, which coming from a right winger is priceless. Has turned around his Hawthorns career after being frozen out last season.

West Brom striker Stephane Sessegnon celebrates scoring a fine opener after just eight minutes

Stephane Sessegnon - 7

Stunning strike to set the mood and ensure West Brom had the initiative for most of the match. Sometimes slack in possession but makes up for it when delivering decisive moments. 

Chris Brunt - 6.5

Lovely pass with his ‘wrong’ foot to set clear Berahino. The weight and direction were judged precisely and allowed his team-mate the time to compose his thoughts. Such a sweet left foot, too.

England U21 star Saido Berahino was once again a nuisance for United, firing West Brom 2-1 up 

Saido Berahino - 7

Growing into his role as Albion’s go-to guy. There was little doubt he would convert when bearing down on De Gea and the finish against a goalkeeper capable of unfathomable saves was inch-perfect. 

SUBSTITUTES

Youssouf Mulumbu - (86')

MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-4-1)  

David de Gea - 6

Had little to do other than pick the ball out of his net. Two shots on target, two goals. Neither one could the Spaniard have done anything about. 

Rafael - 6

Not kicked on in the manner that was hoped when he first broke into the United team as a teenager. There are just too many mistakes. Always a willing runner going forwards and a tenacious tackler but he did not shine here. 

Manchester United defender Phil Jones returned to the side from injury and was kept busy by West Brom

Phil Jones - 6

The better of United’s centre-halves but that is not saying much. Making his return after six weeks out injured so rustiness may be a problem but displayed little of the authority needed. 

Marcos Rojo - 5

Just does not look like a centre-back. Lacks the stature required and on this evidence the knowledge as well. Too often he appeared uncertain and his positing is open to question. 

Luke Shaw - 5

At fault for the opening goal. Got sucked into Myhill’s long ball but beaten in the air by Dorrans to leave huge space on the right flank for Wisdom to run into. Better going forward as the game went on. 

Daley Blind was given the tough task of shielding Manchester United's defence but also managed to score

Daley Blind - 7

Given the tough task of screening United’s defence against a vibrant Albion attack and looked lost for the opening goal. But redeemed himself in the second half and provided an equaliser of great quality. 

Ander Herrera - 5.5

Hooked at half-time and seemingly not fully fit after his rib injury, which he was wearing a corset under his shirt to protect. Pressed high at times but failed to impose himself on the ball. 

Young winger Adnan Januzaj was given a first start in the league by van Gaal but struggled to impose himself

Adnan Januzaj - 5.5

Given his first start in the Premier League by Louis Van Gaal, he operated on the right wing as opposed to the central role that had been expected. Glittering moments were scarce, however.  

Juan Mata - 6

Failed to get into the game in any meaningful way. Handed his preferred role behind the striker but too frequently his involvement slowed moves down. Possesses magic to turn matches but did not show it here. 

Angel di Maria was once again a threat for Manchester United, adding a fourth assist to his three goals so far

Angel di Maria - 7

Subdued for his standards. His cross for Fellaini’s goal was good and there were the usual cracked shot from distance. But substituted before the end to suggest his fitness is not at peak capacity.

Robin Van Persie - 6

Smacked a superb volley into the post to give us a glimpse of the player who won United their 20th league title but in this sole striker role his fading ability is exposed. Needs a partner running off him. Not mobile enough on his own. 

Fellaini roars in delight after scoring his first league goal for Manchester United to equalise at the Hawthorns

Marouane Fellaini - 7

Having made an instant impact off the bench, Fellaini produced a fine goal and put in an industrious display to silence his doubters.

Radamel Falcao - (72') 6

Ashley Young - (76')
