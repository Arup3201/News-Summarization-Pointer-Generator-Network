A vintage sofa that belonged to the real-life Mr Darcy from Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice has sold for more than twice its estimate bid at £2,300.

The George III mahogany framed sofa is thought to have belonged to Thomas Lefroy, a love interest of the famous author who is believed to have provided the inspiration for romantic hero Mr Darcy.

The upholstered Art Nouveau piece was expected to sell for just £1,000 
at Moore Allen & Innocent in Cirencester but today shocked 
collectors as a fan took it for £2,300.

For sale: The sofa that belonged to Thomas Lefroy, who is thought to have been the inspiration for Mr Darcy

Courtship: Austen (left) and Lefroy (right) were both 20 when they began a whirlwind courtship in 1796, the year Pride and Prejudice was written

Inspiration: Lefroy is thought to have inspired the character of Mr Darcy in Pride And Prejudice, played in the 1995 BBC series by Colin Firth

Austen and Lefroy were both 20 when they began a whirlwind courtship in 1796, the year Pride and Prejudice was written.

However, the flirtation ended swiftly when the law student was called to the Bar in Ireland.

A fictitious account of their relationship is at the centre of the 2007 historical romance film Becoming Jane, in which Lefroy is played by actor James McAvoy.

Despite settling down with a wife in Ireland, he did later admit to his nephew that he had loved Austen, but stated that it was a 'boyish love'.

Lefroy, who went on to become the Lord Chief Justice for Ireland, built his own stunning castle-like home, Carrigglas Manor in County Longford, and it is believed the settee was purchased for one of the extravagant rooms.

It is believed that after his death in 1869 the sofa, manor house, and contents of the property were passed down through the family.

After the landmark sale, auctioneer Philip Allwood said: 'We had huge international interest, especially from the States, where they're big on all things Austen.

'It was a nice sofa anyway, but anything to do with Jane Austen was going to create some sort of wider interest.

'I was listening to a radio play about them meeting this week and it was weird thinking, "I've got his sofa in the auction house."'

Despite giving over pages and pages to the vivid description's of her character's complicated love lives, Jane Austen herself never experienced much in the way of romance.

The author never married and when she died a spinster in July 1817 she left most of her money to her sister Cassandra.

Perhaps driven by the romance of her novels, many academics and fans of the novelist have speculated that she had come close to marrying Thomas Lefroy, who was introduced to Austen by his aunt Anne.

Austen wrote two letters to Cassandra in January 1796 mentioning Lefroy, and reporting on her interactions with him, writing in her second letter the 'day is come on which I am to flirt my last with Tom Lefroy', and adding: 'My tears flow as I write, at the melancholy idea'.

However, all mention of Lefroy is buried amongst other observations, including ones about the weather, and other academics maintain that theories that the couple were more than friends would be pure speculation.

As an old man, Lefroy reportedly answered 'with a boyish love' when asked if he had ever been in love with the author, although some have suggested that this was an attempt to play up his association to the woman who was by then a celebrated author.

In 2009 a biography of the author claimed that Austen's true love was a clergyman named Dr Samuel Blackall, who met Austen in 1798.

According to Dr Andrew Norman, Dr Blackall wrote  letters to friends revealing his wish to court the writer, but his uncertainty was treated as a snub by Austen.
