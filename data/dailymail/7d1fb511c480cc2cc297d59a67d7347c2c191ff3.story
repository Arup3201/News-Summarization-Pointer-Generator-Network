Behind bars: Alvin Yee, 44, has been sentenced to spend 11 years in jail for prescribing prescription pain medicine too freely

A doctor who treated his patients at a Starbucks has told how he felt what he was doing was fine because plenty of other professionals meet their clients at the coffee chain.

Dr Alvin Yee has been sentenced to spend 11 years behind bars for prescribing controlled substances without legitimate medical purpose after undercover agents caught him in the act.

The 44-year-old opened up to ABC's Dateline, saying how he didn't see anything wrong with using a Starbucks as a meeting place while he saved money for the funds to buy his own practice.

'There are plenty of lawyers and…other professionals that meet and do business there, and they don't pay rent either,' he told ABC.

That wasn't the only problem with Lee's method, however, as he also became the subject of a Drug Enforcement Agency investigation when they found out he being very lax in his prescriptions.

He was handing out prescriptions for powerful painkillers like OxyContin and anxiety medication Xanax to patients without doing thorough work ups- and even giving them to people who said that they were picking up the prescriptions for friends who couldn't make it to their appointment.

A third of the prescriptions Yee wrote were for people age 25 and younger, prosecutors alleged.

More than a habit: Yee was the subject of an eight-month undercover investigation by the DEA who taped conversations of him giving prescriptions to an officer who claimed to be a recovering heroin addict

Pharmacists in the area said in interviews that they refused to honour Yee's prescriptions because 'they considered them outside the scope of a professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose', wrote DEA agent Mark Nomady.

Dateline tells how an eight-month undercover DEA investigation was launched, and agents were served by Yee during evening Starbucks clinics across the county. Investigators traced the sale of painkillers to people in Seattle, Phoenix and Detroit.

One of the most damning instances came when an agent who was posing as a patient told the doctor that he was a former heroin addict who borrowed painkillers from a friend.

Yee told him: 'You won't be having to bum off your friends anymore.'

While he admitted that it was wrong of him to give a prescription to a 'friend' of the patient, he felt that his dealing with the 'former addict' was appropriate.

Family: Dr Yee, with attorney Lily Allen, who appears to be his wife from pictures on Facebook, had a client base that was mostly younger than 30-years-old

'There are some people that, if they're not able to get access to their…pain meds that they...result to other ways of treating it, and sometimes it's heroin, so that's one way I rationalized it,' he told ABC.

Some of the actual patients who dealt with Yee died while they were receiving his prescriptions, including Derek Rosas.

ABC notes that Yee was not charged in Rosas' death, but his mother places some of the blame on the doctor.

Yee plead guilty to seven of the 56 counts against him and has now been sentenced to 11 years in jail.
