A family was left devastated after their beloved Chihuahua was delivered back to them dead in a carrier bag after it was mauled while being looked after by a dog-walking service.

Two-year-old Chicco was attacked by a bigger dog while being looked after by the company after his owners went on holiday.

The dog's owner Daniel Harris, 40, said his son was 'absolutely heartbroken' when the family asked to have Chicco's remains returned, only for the owner of the dog-walking business to hand the dead dog back in a yellow Next plastic bag.

Mr Harris, a chef, from Worcester, said: 'My son was absolutely heartbroken. I just want to warn people so it doesn’t happen to anyone else.

'I said he wasn’t supposed to be mixed with other dogs as he was so small but he said "It was OK, my wife was there".

'He was a tiny Chihuahua which was the size of two baked bean cans at most.'

Mr Harris and his wife Tracy, 38, had left Chicco in the care of Peter Telfer who runs dog-walking service Local People for Local Pets when they went to Cornwall on holiday on July 20.

Asleep: The family were told of Chicco's death after they returned from their holiday

But when the family returned home on July 27 they received a call from the company telling them Chicco was dead.

Mr Harris added: 'My wife received a call from Mr Telfer who just said "Chicco’s dead, another dog picked him up and threw him and broke his neck, these things happen".

'He was unapologetic about Chicco dying in their care and even tried to blame us for not having him castrated. He said he provoked the other dogs.'

The case is being investigated by the RSPCA.

Mr Telfer, who runs Local People for Local Pets, has defended the company.

He said: 'There was a little disturbance and poor Chicco was there on the floor. It’s such a shame.

'He never should have been with other dogs because he was a hot blooded male.

'He was such a small dog, with all the urges of a bigger dog. It is likely his urges could have set off the other dogs. We are covered by liability insurance.'
