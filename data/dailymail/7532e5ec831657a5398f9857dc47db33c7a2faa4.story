'The couple of weeks that I came back I really struggled - my fiancé said, "You are different" - I was very negative, crying a lot, struggling with a sense of sad lonely souls.

'How do you write something that means so much to them?' Kumi Taguchi, a journalist from the ABC told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Taguchi spent two weeks inside a specialised rehabilitation hospital for returning war veterans who suffer from sever Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Her mental state was put to the test after soldiers allowed her access to their deepest, darkest, secrets and fears they just could not shake.

Ms Taguchi, who is passionate about mental health and studies of the mind, spent a year pursuing entry inside Ward 17 at the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital in Melbourne. During her time she spoke with six men who are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after coming back from war. 

Their stories of isolation and loneliness hit home for the ABC News 24 Presenter who said she just 'could not stand the thought of people being lonely'.

Faced with the dilemma to report like a journalist while trying to protect the soldiers, Ms Taguchi knew it would be a difficult journey.  

She also knew the objective of the clinicians at Ward 17 was to protect the war veterans, firefighters, emergency workers and police who are suffering from sever PTSD.

'The PR guy didn't want me to pitch a story - he just wanted to know who I was, so I spent lots of time speaking with him so he could get to know me,' she said.

'By the end of it he said, "I think you and I are going to get a long" and so he organised me to meet with people who work there - we spoke on how to deal with privacy, and trust I'd not bang down doors'. 

Ward 17 is a critical point where war soldiers who can no longer cope with their PTSD seek help. There is an in-ward and an out-ward

Ms Taguchi and the hospital workers came to the decision that the best way to understand the veterans would be to spend a long period of time in the hospital - two weeks.

'It wasn't at all confronting in the way some people think it was - there weren't people shouting and crying or patients so messed up that they weren't able to function.

'You imagine a big room with beds lined up but it's not like that all - it's peaceful'.  

Ward 17 is a critical point where war soldiers who can no longer cope with their PTSD seek help. There is an in-ward and an out-ward. The out-ward is where suffers can seek specialised help without sleeping there and the in-ward is where they spend nights. Only men have been through the in-ward.

'Two women were in an out-ward program. I saw them but they did not want to speak', Ms Taguchi said. 

'There are two theories;  women are dealing with their mental illness or stress better than men, or that women are not dealing with it but thinking that they are dealing with it.'

Walking into the hospital with only pen and paper, Ms Taguchi had no agenda but after talking to the six men aged between 29 and 50 the issue of identity proved to be a reoccurring theme amongst the soldiers.

'When you can't let go of that identity, you are forever looking back in time,' she said.  

Ms Taguchi made a point to the men living in the ward that they were under no obligation to speak with her, leaving it completely up to them.

Before speaking with the veterans Ms Taguchi had no idea how opened they would be.

'Psychologists told me, "once they trust you, you will be trusted by them for life", and it was true - their honesty was so raw from the point where it was unbelievably brave and much more honest than I or anyone I know would be.

'I was amazed at how broken they were, how lost they felt, how lonely they felt and hopeless they felt - I had tears in my eyes,' she said. 

'A lot of them struggled with sacrifice - feeling like they weren't worthy to suffer because they have never been fought on the front-line.'

One of the men she spoke with was a young man she named Tim. She said he had a sense of 'utter loneliness' which broke her heart. 

'He didn't think he had anything to say but if you read his CV you would think it was like a spy novel.

'He is a highly trained young man who sat there opposite me with shaggy hair and a beard. He said he wanted to put nicer clothes on because he had no interaction with anyone - only his mum and his psychologist. 

'I saw a young man, fit and handsome who was could be on top of the world.' 

What really struck a cord with Ms Taguchi was the amount of courage every veteran had.

'I would ask them, "Do you realise how courageous it is to tell a story? It isn't only on a battlefield" - but they couldn't see that.' 

Ms Taguchi witnessed the steps clinicians took to help these soldiers get their life back. She said they worked with the men to help confront anger, disappointment, guilt, sadness and acknowledging that these notions are valid and need to be addressed.

Ms Taguchi said, 'It wasn't at all confronting in the way some people think it was - there weren't people shouting and crying or patients so messed up that they weren't able to function'

'It gave them a platform to start to address their lives', she said. 'A number of guys said this place saved me, without this place I wouldn't be here,' Ms Taguchi said. 

She told Daily Mail Australia listening to these men speak so highly of Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital raised the question of whether Australia needs more places dedicated to veterans. 

'We only have one more place in Adelaide which works with veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.' 

The ABC reported 96 Australian Defence Force members and 13 veterans have committed suicide since 2000.

Ms Taguchi admits when she returned back to Sydney after her two weeks in Melbourne life was tough. 

'I realised it really got to me,' she said. 'As a journalist you are meant to write a story and then move on.' 

'I recognised symptoms within myself - you have to get your mental health to a point where it is quite resilient. 

'I got to a point where I couldn't write - I had to reset what I thought it was to be a journalist and look after my own health - plus I had a deadline.'

Ms Taguchi's unique online report captured the daily struggles soldiers face when returning home from war. 

She said a lot of the soldiers were relieved that the story was treated sensitively and honestly. 

'I received some very sad texts from the soldiers saying it was great to tell their story and it also made them realise how tough their life really is.

'A guy [soldier] texted me after it was published saying thank you so much for letting people know about their struggles.'
