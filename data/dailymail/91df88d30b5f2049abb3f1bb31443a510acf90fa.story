Glasgow 2014 is now Scotland's most successful Commonwealth Games after Jen McIntosh took silver in the women's 50 metres rifle three positions.

Team Scotland passed their record for gold medals on Monday - winning 13 compared to the 11 picked up in 2006 - and on Tuesday moved ahead of the 33 medals won in Edinburgh in 1986.

The breakdown of 13 golds, nine silvers and 12 bronzes takes them to a net figure of 34 with over five days of action still remaining.

The achievements of Alex Marshall and Paul Foster secured the gold record on Monday, and McIntosh's efforts meant Scotland's pre-Games target of 34 has been achieved.

The tally was set to be boosted further on Tuesday evening by the men's artistic gymnasts, with Frank Baines, Adam Cox, Liam Davie, Dan Keatings and Dan Purvis poised to take another medal in the team event.
