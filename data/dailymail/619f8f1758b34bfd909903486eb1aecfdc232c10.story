A grieving daughter was forced to take her late father's ashes to their local bank to prove to staff he was dead.

Siobhon Peers, 31, had lost her father David, aged 67, to bone cancer in October 2011. But she received around 20 letters from the Royal Bank of Scotland claiming her father owed £6 on his account.

Although she sent a copy of her father's death certificate to close the account the bank insisted the original certificate must be shown.

Mother-of-two Miss Peers was then mailed a string of further letters as the outstanding overdraft amount mushroomed to £625 with interest.

Eventually Miss Peers stunned bank staff and customers by going to the local RBS branch in Davenport, near Stockport, Greater Manchester, in person with the urn containing her father's ashes.

She then dumped it on the counter - along with the original death certificate and declared: 'You wanted proof my dad is dead - well here he is. I've brought him along with me.'

She said: 'I took my dad to the bank, slapped his ashes on the counter and thought that would be the end of it. There was nothing owing on the account and I was sick of getting hassled.'

Miss Peers, who was her father's carer after he retired as a builder's labourer added: 'It has been 18 months of hell. I have told the bank over and over to close the account and it hasn't been done.

'They asked me for a copy of his death certificate and I sent it straight away but still they didn't close it down.

'Because of that it built up charges from direct debits and charges grew to over £600.'

She said she took her father's ashes to the RBS branch two weeks ago after reaching the end of her tether.

She said: 'I slapped his ashes down on the counter and said "This is David Peers and I want to close his account for him". The lady behind the counter had such a shock that she ran away and wouldn't come back.

'Eventually the bank manager came to see me and agreed to close the account. But even after that I had another letter to my father from the bank come to the house. I just can't believe how the bank has treated us.

'It is as if the bank has been deliberately trying to upset me. It has been a very difficult time losing my father and this has just made it so difficult. I have had on average two letters per week for the past 18 months chasing him forthe bank charges.

'All I want now is a decent apology. I sent them a copy of the death certificate and that should have been enough. I didn't want to give them the original as I obviously I wanted to keep that.'

The problem started with an unresolved £6 charge on the account after Mr Peers's death which the RBS told his daughter had been imposed as there were insufficient funds to cover a withdrawal.

It increased to more than £600 and has now been passed onto a debt recovery agent although the account has been closed.

Miss Peers who has two sons and still lives in the house she shared with her father, lost her mother Norma when she was just 15.

A spokesman for the Royal Bank of Scotland said: 'After Ms Peers visited the branch further information came to light which meant it was necessary to contact her again. We apologise for any distress cause and have now closed theaccount.'
