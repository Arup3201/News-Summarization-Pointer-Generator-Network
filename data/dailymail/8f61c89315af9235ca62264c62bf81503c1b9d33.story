Boris Johnson has admitted his brother Jo is 'very likely' to be Prime Minister before him but added he would not 'shaft him' in the same way Ed Miliband did his sibling David.

The Mayor of London attacked the 'Leftie' Labour leader on a trip to Australia and said he had won the 2010 battle with his brother because to him family ties are 'trivial'.

In an extraordinary attack he said Mr Miliband was a 'socialist' who views individuals as 'discrete agents devoid of ties to society or to each other, and that’s how Stalin could murder 20 million people'.

Mr Johnson's brother is now head of the Tory policy unit at Number 10, and Boris has admitted he would do an outstanding job at Number 10.

I think he'd be brilliant', he said, and when asked if Jo would be Prime Minister before him he added: 'I think it is very likely'.

But he denied he would commit political fratricide.

'Absolutely not. we don't do things that way, that's a very 
left-wing thing,' he told the Australian newspaper.

'Only a socialist could do that to his brother, only a
socialist could regard familial ties as being so trivial as to shaft 
his own brother. I mean, unbelievable!

'Only lefties can think like that they see people as discrete agents devoid of ties to society or to 
each other, and that's how Stalin could murder 20 million people.'

Rivalry: Ed Miliband beat his brother David to the Labour leadership in 2010, and his sibling has quit politics openly saying he was hurt by what happened

The falling out over the notorious Labour leadership battle between the Milibands still refuses to heal fully.

David Miliband, who quit as an MP and now lives in new York, said last month: 'The truth is that these things, you can never erase them from memory.

41-year-old Jo Johnson's appointment as the head of David Cameron’s policy unit took most people in Westminster by surprise.

The quiet promotion of the old Etonian, who has only been an MP for only three years, was the idea of Chancellor George Osborne.

Apart from harnessing journalist Jo’s strategic skills in a bid to make the Tories more popular, the move is seen as a way to rein in Boris, and it appears to have worked.
