William Roache was described as a ‘cockroach with a capital C’ by a Coronation Street co-star, a court heard yesterday.

One of Roache’s alleged sex assault victims said Peter Adamson, who played Len Fairclough in the soap, warned her: ‘You want to keep your eye on him, he will lead you astray.’

Roache, 81, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, who has appeared as Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch, denies two counts of rape and five counts of indecent assault involving five complainants aged 16 and under on dates between 1965 and 1971.

On trial:  Coronation Street actor Bill Roache (3rd left) arrives at Preston Crown Court with sons James (left), Linus (2nd left) and daughter Verity today

The alleged victim, who was around 14 
at the time and said Roache indecently assaulted her in his dressing 
room, told the court she was touring the Granada Studios in Manchester 
when Adamson, who died in 2002, made the accusation.

She
 said: ‘It was Len Fairclough that made the comment because when he said
 it, he looked directly at him and he looked at us, and said: “You want 
to keep your eye on him, he will lead you astray”. He called him a 
cockroach with a capital C.'

She told the jury at Preston Crown Court 
last week that Roache groped her in a room after being led past the 
Rovers Return pub on the set.

'It's easy for you to sit there and judge, but 
you wasn't (sic) in that room. He abused me whether he likes it or not. 
He assaulted me and I had to carry it round with me. Can
 you imagine what would have happened to me if I'd gone to the police as
 a child. He's a dirty b******, he tried it on with me'

- Alleged victim to Roache's barrister

The
 court heard that the alleged victim and her sister would sit on the 
steps outside the studio in the summer holidays in the mid to late 
1960s, along with other girls and boys who were autograph-hunting.

But
 on one occasion after being invited inside the studios, Roache, who has
 played Ken Barlow in the ITV soap for more than 50 years, took her to 
his dressing room and indecently assaulted her by putting his hands on 
her breasts and up her skirt.

She told police: 'He was like an octopus - hands everywhere.'

In a video interview played to the court 
on Friday the woman said it was Johnny Briggs, who played Mike Baldwin in the series, who warned her about Roache.

The
 witness agreed yesterday that at first she told police the 'cockroach' 
remark about Roache had been made by the actor who plays the character 
Mike Baldwin, but said she later corrected herself when she realised it 
was Peter Adamson, who played Len Fairclough.

Challenged
 about her account by Louise Blackwell QC, defending, the witness told 
the court: ‘I’m telling the truth. Why the hell would I put myself 
through all of this?’ 

She
 went on: 'I am confused with all the dates. I'm here as a witness to 
witness what happened in that room. If I had known what I was going to 
go though, I wouldn't have come forward.

'I
 feel like I'm on trial here. It's Mr Barlow, Ken Barlow, who has done 
it, not me. The issue is what he did to me. I'm sorry, but, as a victim,
 I'm so sorry that I ever come forward.'

Distressed,
 she told the barrister: 'It's easy for you to sit there and judge, but 
you wasn't (sic) in that room. He abused me whether he likes it or not. 
He assaulted me and I had to carry it round with me.

'Can
 you imagine what would have happened to me if I'd gone to the police as
 a child. He's a dirty b******, he tried it on with me'.

Her husband told the court he recalled his wife telling him about the alleged assault about two years into their marriage. 

Allegations: One of Roache's alleged victims said that Coronation Street actor Peter Adamson, who played Len Fairclough, right, warned her that the star was a 'cockroach' and would lead her 'astray', the court heard

The witness was asked by Miss Blackwell about press interest in her story and reporters visiting her house.

She said her sister had 'two visits from the Mirror' and had been offered £25,000 for her story.

The
 witness added she was visited once by a reporter from The Sun, but the 
only money mentioned was a donation of an undisclosed amount to a 
charity.

'I know what's going through your mind,' she told Miss Blackwell, 'and it's not going to happen, because I did not want money.'

She
 added: 'If I wanted money I could've sold my story but I have not sold 
my story. I have spoken to nobody except those who should know.'

The court also heard Roache made a girl carry out a sex act on him as
 he drove his Rolls-Royce and then dropped her on the street saying: 
`There's half a crown, get the bus back'.

The
 alleged incident happened after the girl and a close friend had 
travelled to Manchester to visit the Coronation Street studios.

But as they were about to leave she said the actor walked up to her and asked `Would you like a lift home?'

In a video interview played to the 
court she said: 'I thought "Well, I'm with my friend, it should be okay."
 We said yes. He had a gold Silver Cloud Rolls-Royce. I said where we 
were going and he said 'Oh, I'm going that way'.

'I
 said `We'll get in the back, but he said to me `No, you go in the 
front`. We set off and everything was fine. We got into the main road, 
in the mainstream traffic.'

Evidence: The woman first claimed in a police video shown in court that Johnny Briggs, 
(right in 1974) who played Mike Baldwin, warned her
 to 'watch' William Roache (left in 1961), but she corrected it today

She
 said the actor didn't speak to her but began fumbling around and then 
grasped her hand and placed it on his crotch.

She said she began to 
perform a sex act on him until they came to a road junction and a double
 decker bus pulled up alongside the car.

'We
 came to a junction,' she said. 'We were on the inside and there was a 
double decker bus next to us. I pulled my hand away but he put it back.'
 She said she hadn't looked at him at all while performing the sex act 
and when it was over he said he would drop them off.

She said: 'He said `I'll have to drop you off here`. He said `There's half a crown, get the bus back`.

Roache, 81, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, denies
 two counts of rapes and five counts of indecent assault involving five 
complainants aged 16 and under on dates between 1965 and 1971.

The trial continues.
