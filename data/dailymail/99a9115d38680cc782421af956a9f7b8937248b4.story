Jailed: Attila Ban, 32, knifed Tibor Vass and 
Alice Adams, both 20, to death in a staff flat behind the hotel where 
they worked

A double killer who spent two days hiding inside a divan bed at the murder scene was jailed yesterday for 26 years.

Hotel receptionist Attila Ban, 32, stabbed colleagues Tibor Vass and Alice Adams in a jealous, drug-fuelled rage.

He then had a bath with Mr Vass’s body and lay it on his bed before concealing himself in the hollow base.

Armed with a ‘survival kit’ of a knife, mobile phone and bottle of water, Ban cut a peephole to watch police as they searched the flat for clues.

He even updated his Facebook page after the killings, writing: ‘I’d like to wake up from this nightmare.’

Police launched a manhunt, but found him only when he emerged after two days and tried to kill himself.

Judge Gerald Gordon said Ban was a vain and paranoid man who murdered two ‘innocent and decent’ young people.

Sentencing him to 26 years in prison, he said the killer was ‘infatuated’ with Mr Vass and exploded with rage over his friendship with Miss Adams.

Ban and his victims worked on reception at the four-star Radisson Edwardian Hotel at Heathrow Airport in West London.

The killings took place after Ban discovered Mr Vass, 20, was planning to leave and return to university, the Old Bailey heard.

He had developed an obsession with his fellow Hungarian and they moved in together when Ban was offered a staff flat as a reward for good work.

Miss Adams, 20, had been working at the hotel for only three weeks when she joined the pair for drinking games at the flat on August 9 last year.

In the early hours of the next day, Ban launched a frenzied attack on his sleeping friends.

Miss Adams, of Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, died from 22 stab wounds and was left lying like a ‘rag doll’ on the floor. Mr Vass died from two knife thrusts that penetrated his heart.

The judge told Ban: ‘There is no doubt you killed them both extremely violently.

‘Exactly what happened we will probably never know. You said that you cannot remember and that may well be true.’

After his arrest he pretended he had suddenly been struck dumb and communicated in sign language - and he still maintains he cannot remember the massacre.

Dressed in the same brown sweater he wore throughout the trial, Ban nodded as sentence was passed and showed no emotion as he was led away to the cells.

Ban was a workaholic who had previously worked in similar jobs in the hotel industry in the US and had was named Employee of the Year at the Heathrow hotel six months before he killed his colleagues.

He was openly gay and had developed a crush on Mr Vass, a fellow Hungarian, after the younger man started work in August 2010, having moved to the UK after he was turned down for a university place.

But Ban was jealous of his relationships with women and had repeatedly launched outbursts at him when he was left out of social events.

He was so possessive he manipulated bosses into letting him have one of the sought-after hotel flats and convinced Mr Vass to move in with him.

But he was overcome with grief when he learned his friend had finally been offered a university place and was due to go back to Hungary to begin his studies in September last year.

Hiding place: Ban took a water bottle and his mobile 
phone with him inside the divan bed and used a knife to fashion a spyhole in the bed base, 
through which he watched police scouring the scene for clues

Miss Adams was interested in music and performing arts but took a job as a hotel receptionist to help her mother out financially.

She had separated from her boyfriend Tad Finney but they had got back together at the time of her death.

Miss Adams was looking forward to taking the trip of a lifetime to see her aunt Kathryn get married in Hawaii and was due to fly out a week after the killing.

Detectives believe Ban was driven to kill after seeing Mr Vass and Miss Adams kissing at the hotel-owned flat Ban shared with Mr Vass in Harlington, west London.

Several friends had been at their flat that night and Ban and others had taken poppers - a well known muscle relaxant.

Ban launched his attack after he was left alone with his victims. He told the court that in the room they lay on the bed and both men took it in turns to perform sex acts on Miss Adams.

Prosecutors accept there was sexual activity between all three as the DNA from both men was found on Ms Adam’s breasts.

Ban said he could remember the threesome but could not recall killing the pair.

When he woke up he found the couple dead. 'I accept I killed them. I just can’t remember what happened,' he said.

Ban said he tried to kill himself by cutting his wrists and got into the bath with Mr Vass’s body.

‘I did not want to die alone,’ he told the jury.

He said he threw a hairdryer in the bath with him to commit suicide - but the appliance simply kept on working under water.

The alarm was not raised until around 3pm the next day when all three failed to show up to work the late shift at the hotel.

Police forced entry and were confronted with a bloodbath - but Ban was nowhere to be found. They initially believed he could have jumped out of a window or had been hiding in the flat’s loft.

Another theory was that he had stashed a clean pair of shoes outside the door and used them to make his getaway without leaving a tell-tale trail of blood.

It was only two days later that a forensic examiner noticed the bedroom door, which had previously been left open, was now shut.

Detectives found the single bed had been used to wedge it shut and on forcing entry they discovered Ban lying naked and face down on the bed, caked in blood.

A craft knife was sticking out of his arm and another was protruding from his buttock.

On examining the divan bed, police found Ban had used a knife to open out the inside to allow himself more space to move around.

He had spent hours inside and had even defecated inside the divan. Ban claimed he had reached from a hole in the bed to grab a bottle of mineral water when the police were actually in the room.

Police said it did not occur to them Ban was still in the room - and they would not have moved the bed for fear of disturbing forensic evidence.

Det Insp John Finch, of the Met’s homicide and serious crime command, said: 'The concept of him hiding out in a bed for two days with a dead man he has killed and dumped on top of him is beyond belief.'

Police say it is possible Ban was able to rearrange the crime scene - but stressed the public were never at risk.

Michael Birnbaum QC, for Ban, said the killer’s actions in bathing Mr Vass before leaving him posed were 'perhaps some kind of homage to Tibor'.

Speaking about hiding in the bed, he added: 'I would suggest it’s not a matter to hold against him. He himself said he felt like he wanted to die and if they [the police] came in they would save him.

'On the second night he certainly wasn’t trying to conceal the fact he was there because he came out and changed a large number of things to make clear his presence.'

Ban was deeply remorseful and wanted to plead guilty to murder, he told the court.

The killer also offered - through Mr Birnbaum - to meet his victim's parents in a bid to help them grieve.

'It might be that in months, or more likely years, to come, if he did remember more of what happened that would be a realistic prospect,' said the lawyer.

Ban denied two counts of murder and was convicted. He had already admitted manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility.
