A woman whose leg muscles were shredded in the Boston bombing has shown extraordinary determination as she prepares to run a marathon this weekend.

Lee Ann Yanni, 31, was standing 10 feet from the finish line with her husband Nick, 32, when the first of two homemade bombs detonated on April 15, killing three and injuring more than 270.

Shrapnel shattered her fibula and tore her leg muscles - but just six months and three surgeries later, she will be taking part in Sunday's Chicago Marathon.

'I don't care if I have to walk, crawl or piggyback,' she told the Boston Herald. 'I'm not letting these fools take my first marathon away from me.'

Fighter: Lee Ann Yanni's left leg was broken and her muscle was torn by shrapnel in the Boston marathon bombing in April. In an astonishing show of determination, she is running a marathon on Sunday

Yanni, who had to learn how to walk again after her devastating injuries, is running in memory of her father, who died of cancer this time last year.

Although this is her first full marathon, before the April blast she had ran numerous road races and half marathons. She now hopes to finish the 26.2 mile race in about six hours.

Even taking part in the race is an astonishing feat, considering less than six months ago she was in hospital for eight days after undergoing surgery.

The blast caused blood to pour from her leg as shrapnel broke the bone in her left leg and lodged inside, and tore muscles. Her husband Nick escaped with just a pierced eardrum.

Strong: She is running the Chicago Marathon in memory of her father, who died of cancer last year

'It was a very large boom,' she said in an interview afterwards. 'It just sounded like fireworks. I felt something hit my leg. So I looked down and saw the bone sticking out, and being a physical therapist the first think I said to myself, "That's not good".'

Her husband added: 'All of a sudden, it was like a cannon went off. And honest to God, at first, I didn’t think anything of it. I look back, and I see a cloud of smoke, and I realized that something was going on.'

He followed her into a store to make a tourniquet out of a shirt and then helped other victims, but they were reunited in the medical tent before Yanni was taken to Tufts Medical Center.

Among her surgeries, Yanni needed a skin graft and has been left with a large, dark scar across her left shin - but that isn't stopping her.

Support: Yanni was with her husband Nick near to the finish line when the bombs went off on April 15

Aftermath: Three people were killed and more than 270 were injured after the blasts in Boston, pictured

'There are days that I look at my leg
and completely break down and then there are days that I go, "OK, it 
doesn't look so bad",' she said.

She
had to re-learn how to walk and has been undergoing physical therapy, 
and she knows that the healing will be an on-going process.

'We are all getting our butts kicked 
every single day by our therapists, our psychologists or our friends to 
get back,' Yanni said. 'Every­body’s in it to get back to our new 
normal.'
