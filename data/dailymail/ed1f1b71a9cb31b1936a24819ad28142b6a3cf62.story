A school has been banned from a zoo for two years after a group of children decided to moon at monkeys.

The 14 and 15-year-olds from Radclyffe School in Chadderton, Greater Manchester, were kicked out of Chester Zoo during a school trip.

There were around 300 GCSE pupils from year 10, but as a result of the actions of nearly children, they all had to get on the buses and go home.

The zoo said that 29 pupils were involved, but headmaster of the school Hardial Hayer disputed this saying that only 24 children took part.

Scrutiny: Last year it was revealed that Radclyffe School in Greater Manchester has 56 CCTV cameras at its £28m building

Officials
at the park said they had no option but to enforce the ban on the 
entire school taking trips there in future. The ban will last until 
2015.

Some
pupils bared their backsides at the monkeys, while others hurled food 
at them and it is alleged that there was also damage to property.

A zoo spokesman said: 'A party of 300 pupils from the school were booked in for a school trip at the zoo.

'Some of those pupils were involved in various disruptive incidents and, as a result, 29 students were evicted from the zoo.

'We have spoken and written to the headteacher and, due to the severity of the disruptive behaviour, regrettably we have had to take the step of banning the school from visiting until September 2015.

'The spokesman added: 'We welcome schools to the zoo on the understanding that the students behave in such a way that does not cause problems for their fellow pupils, other visitors, the animals or staff. Fortunately incidents of this nature are extremely rare.'

Mr Hayer insisted it was 24, rather than 29, students who were sent home early due to their behaviour.

Reassurance: Radclyffe's headmaster Hardial Hayer said the school expects 'high standards standards of behaviour inside and outside school' as Chester Zoo imposes a ban on his pupils

He said: 'We had over 300 students at Chester Zoo as part of an experience day. It was 24 who didn’t meet our own high standards and that is why we brought them back. The deputy head teacher and senior staff met with their parents.

'We always try and uphold very high standards of behaviour inside and outside school. If any fall below those standards, we have internal procedures. As far as we are concerned, we’ve dealt with the matter.'

The trip took place on Thursday last week as part of the school’s end of term activities.

Mr Hayer, 53, didn’t comment on whether the students had been suspended.

But news of the ban was rife on Twitter. One user tweeted: 'The Radclyffe school has been banned from goin to chester zoo for 2 years cos’ the students where too bad! Ahahahahh they got thrown out lol.'

Another wrote: 'See children from Radclyffe School were so badly behaved they have been banned from Chester Zoo for 2 years, parents will blame the animals.'

A
third said: 'Radclyffe School have apparently been banned from and by 
Chester Zoo because the students were pulling moonies at the animals, 
W0T hahahah.'

Radclyffe 
School, which has the motto 'working together for excellence', was 
formerly Chadderton Grammar School before becoming a comprehensive in 
1975.

Former pupils include St Helens rugby league player Kyle Eastmond and Hollyoaks actress Dominique Jackson.

Chadderton
Grammar's former pupils include Labour MP former Solicitor General Vera
Baird and John Stalker, former deputy Chief Constable of Greater 
Manchester Police.

Last year it emerged that there are 56 CCTV in the school's £28m building - the highest number in the country.

Twenty of them were installed at the washbasins and doors outside changing rooms and toilets - to curb the possibility of bullying.

Chester Zoo is one of the most popular zoos in the country with more than 1.4million visitors every year. Star attractions include the elephant, lion and the Realm of the Red Ape enclosures.
