Gus Poyet says only Jozy Altidore will determine his Sunderland future and is not concerned by the striker’s comments hinting he could quit the club in January.

The USA frontman – who scored during Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Honduras – admits he will look to leave the Black Cats if he is not given more first-team opportunities.

Altidore, though, has only scored one Premier League goal since his £6.5million move from AZ Alkmaar last summer.

Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has dismissed Altidore's claims that he may quit the club in January

And Poyet insists it is up to the player to win the starting position he craves.

‘Players pick themselves, not me,’ said the Uruguayan, whose side travel to Southampton on Saturday.

‘Look at (Steven) Fletcher, he was out but then came in and was on fire (he scored two in the 3-1 win over Stoke).

‘For Jozy it is the same. I understand (what he said), because every player wants to play.

‘But I think he’s better than last year, he’s calmer, and I think he will score goals.

‘Strikers need goals and if they’re scoring they’re happy.’

Meanwhile, former France international defender Anthony Reveillere has been given the chance to win a contract at the Stadium of Light.

The 34-year-old was released Napoli at the end of last season and has been training with Sunderland this week.
