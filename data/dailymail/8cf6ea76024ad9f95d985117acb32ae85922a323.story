He has travelled to some of the most glamorous locations in the world and lives in a palace but Prince Charles looked surprisingly at home as he descended into London's deepest sewer.

Wearing a hard hat and a bright orange high-viz jacket over his pinstriped grey suit, Charles was on inquisitive form and peppered his hosts from Thames Water with questions as he went.

Luckily for the heir to the throne, the Lee Tunnel is brand new and won't be connected to the capital's pipes until December 2015.

Futuristic: The Prince of Wales was 75m below the surface of London today, as he visited the Lee Tunnel

When it is, the tunnel, dubbed a 'super sewer' by London mayor Boris Johnson, will have the capacity to carry up to 16 million tonnes of waste at any one time.

Charles was joined for his visit by a group of engineers, all of whom were among the team that helped to construct it.

He also met apprentices Liam Kelleher, 19, and Tony Brown, 23, during his tour and spent several minutes chatting to them.

A supporter of apprenticeship schemes, the Prince has spoken in the past of the importance of giving young people hands-on experience and the chance of a career in engineering.

'Apprentices and young people have a key part to play in our future,' said Thames Water CEO Martin Baggs after the visit.

Enjoying himself: Charles toured the  'super-sewer' with apprentices Liam Kelleher, 19, and Tony Brown, 23

Impressive: The enormous tunnel is 7km long, seven metres wide and cost £635m to complete

Fascinated: The Prince peppered the engineers accompanying him on the tour with questions

'Bringing in new talent now is crucial as we need an army of operational staff ready to take over from those who will inevitably retire in years to come.' 

The vast tunnel, which was commissioned to put an end to leakage from London's creaking Victorian sewer system, sits 75m below ground, runs for seven kilometres and cost £635m to build.

Although not currently on-line, the Abbey Mills Pumping Station, which sits next to the Lee Tunnel, is and was processing thousands of tonnes of waste as the Prince was shown around.

Despite the thousands of tonnes of sewage travelling through its pipes, the building was surprisingly free from bad smells, leaving Charles free to admire its ornate interior.

Built as part of London's original sewerage system, the building was designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and played a key role in helping to rid the capital of diseases such as cholera.

The Victorian system, which was opened by Charles' great-great-grandfather Edward VII while he was still Prince of Wales, is celebrating its 150th birthday this year.

Not his usual look: Charles donned a hard hat, high-viz jacket and a pair of goggles during the tour

Overflow: Currently, 39m tonnes of waste are leaking into the Thames from London's overworked sewers

Still going strong: Abbey Mills was built in 1865 by Sir Joseph Bazalgette but is still in use

Opened in 1865, it replaced the old habit of dumping rubbish and faeces directly into the Thames - behaviour that famously resulted in the Great Stink of 1858.

So revolting was the smell emanating from the Thames, even Parliament was affected, with Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli describing the river as 'a Stygian pool, reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors'.

The disgusting stench that summer did prove to have some benefits, however; the main one being the speedy agreement of MPs to Sir Joseph Bazalgette's sewer plans.

Part of them was Abbey Mills, where Prince Charles, watched by Thames Water workers and staff from sanitation charity, Water Aid, unveiled a plaque.

All smiles: Charles was following in the footsteps of Edward VII who opened Abbey Mills in 1865

Beautiful: The pumping station is famous for its beautiful architecture and ornate interior

Reception: At the end of the tour, Charles attended a reception, during which he unveiled a plaque

'We can often take our own access to safe water and sanitation for granted,' added Mr Baggs. 'The focus on our history really reminds us that a time when we too didn’t have the basic human requirements our taps and toilets provide isn’t that long ago. 

'Anyone living in London today owes Sir Joseph Bazalgette a great debt of gratitude.'

Prince Charles has been the president of Water Aid since 1991. Speaking after the Prince's visit, Rosemary Carr, deputy chairman of WaterAid said:

'Despite our joint achievements, today - astonishingly – 748 million people still don't have access to safe water and 2.5 million still live without access to somewhere safe and private to go to the toilet. 

'Tragically, this causes the easily preventable death of a young child every single minute.'
