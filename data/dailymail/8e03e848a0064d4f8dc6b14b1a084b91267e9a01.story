Michigan police say a minivan carrying a high school golf team broadsided another van, killing the coach, a player and a passenger in the other vehicle.

State Police Sgt. Don Bailey says the coach and six players from the Grayling High School boys' golf team were headed to a match earlier today when their silver minivan broadsided a white minivan in Excelsior Township, about 25 miles east of Traverse City.

According to the Michigan State Police, a silver van with seven people inside was traveling northbound on Crawford Lake and a white van with three occupants was traveling eastbound on County Road 612

Location: The crash occurred in Northern Michigan as members of the golf team were heading to a tournament

Sgt. Bailey says a 17-year-old player was killed and four other members of the Grayling High School golf team are in critical condition.

The condition of a fifth golfer was not immediately available.

A 27-year-old woman in the white minivan also was killed. The female driver was injured, while a 3-year-old girl appeared unhurt.

No names have been released. Six other people were transported to Munson Medical Center in Traverse City.

Police say the two vans collided at the two way stop at the intersection. They say speed was a factor for both cars in the crash.

'It was pretty horrific,' Michigan State Police Sgt. Don Bailey said of the crash.

Bailey told The Associated Press he came upon the crash shortly after it occurred about 11:30 a.m. Monday in Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula. He had to use a fire extinguisher to put out a fire in one of the vehicles.

'There were three ejections and those bodies were laying around,' he said.

Team players: The Grayling High School makes sport a top priority

Smashed: The crash occurred just after 11am this morning

A message on the Crawford-Ausable School District hotline confirmed the boys traveling in one of the vans involved in the crash belonged to the varsity golf team.

A Twitter hashtag,Â #prayersforgrayling, has also been created to honor those affected in the two-vehicle crash.

A woman driving the white minivan was in serious condition, while a 3-year-old girl in that vehicle appeared to be unhurt. Bailey said the girl was in a child restraint seat.

Theories: It's thought that one of the vehicles ran through a stop sign

Students at Grayling High School were 
notified of the crash Monday afternoon, and events and practices were 
canceled, according to Joe Powers, superintendent of the Crawford 
AuSable Schools.

Crisis team counselors will be at the school on Tuesday.

'We do have classes because we believe the students need each other,' said Powers.

'We will delay the formal start of school to have an opportunity for 
students to talk to each other. We will have counselors throughout the 
building, including the hallway, so students can lean on adults they 
know and who they are comfortable with.'

Delays: The road the cars were traveling along was closed for four hours after the crash

Prayers: The community are supporting one another

The superintendent of Crawford-Ausable Schools released the following statement about the crash:

'This is a very sad day as our golf team was involved in an accident. The entire Crawford Ausable family's thoughts and prayers are with the families of the students, coach, and the members of the other vehicle. We are anxiously awaiting details from the State Police.'

The road was closed for about four hours.
