As Netflix continues to expand its market across the globe it has started looking to pirate websites to find out which shows are popular before the company buys them.

Just this week the video streaming giant rolled out its services to the Netherlands where it hopes to build a large user base.

Netflix Vice President of Content Acquisition, Kelly Merryman, says that their new presence in Europe is partly based on what shows do well on BitTorrent networks and other pirate sites.

‘With the purchase of series, we look at what does well on piracy sites, Merryman says, according to TorrentFreak.

One of the shows that Netflix acquired the rights to in the Netherlands is Prison Break, since it is heavily pirated locally.

‘Prison Break is exceptionally popular on piracy sites,’ Merryman says.

The show, starring actor Wentworth Miller, was broadcast on Fox for four seasons, from 2005 until 2009.

According to Netflix CEO, Reed Hastings, people who download content without permission via torrent sites is not necessarily a bad thing, as it also creates demand for the content Netflix is offering.

Eventually these BitTorrent users may want to switch to Netflix as it’s a much better user experience than torrenting, according to the CEO.

Through Netflix, consumers can still get cheap unlimited entertainment online, without the fear of being sued for illegally downloading music and movies.

‘Netflix is so much easier than torrenting. You don’t have to deal with files, you don’t have to download them and move them around. You just click and watch,’ Hastings says.

A matter of time: Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix, says people who use pirate sites will eventually turn to Netflix

One goal of Netflix is to convert people who currently use pirate sites to get their fix, and there is some evidence that this is indeed happening.

According to Hastings, there is evidence that BitTorrent traffic in Canada dropped 50 per cent after Netflix started there three years ago.

The real challenge for the streaming service is to license as much content as they can, which is easier said than done.

It might not be a coincidence that Game of Thrones is the most pirated TV show, according to TorrentFreak.

Price they could refuse: Netflix was not able to buy Game of Thrones from HBO, no matter what they offered

After all, Netflix wasn’t able to buy the rights from HBO no matter what they offered.

Premium cable channels are withholding their most popular series, including Game of Thrones and Dexter, because they are worried about losing subscribers if the content is available on Netflix's less expensive Internet service.

Time Warner's Jeff Bewkes told The Verge that piracy was 'a tremendous word-of-mouth thing' as well.

'If you go around the world, I think you're right, that Game of Thrones is the most pirated show in the world,' he said. 'Now that's better than an Emmy.'
