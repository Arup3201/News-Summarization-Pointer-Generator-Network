An eco-warrior has made his home in an apple tree to prevent developers chopping it down.

Rowan Burrough has spent most of the past week in the 150-year-old tree, in the heart of Cider With Rosie country in Gloucestershire.

His efforts have drawn comparisons with those of Swampy – real name Daniel Hooper – the campaigner who hit the headlines in 1996 when he dug tunnels under the proposed routes of major road projects.

Shall not be moved: Rowan Burrough has been camping out in the boughs of this apple tree for the past week

Happy camper: Mr Burrough has constructed a bed and brought up other essentials

He has garnered overwhelming support from residents, who have been bringing him soup, sandwiches and water.

But the protest was almost ended yesterday when the 44-year-old climbed down at 3am to try to sneak a few hours' sleep in a bed.

By 5am contractors had moved in and begun lopping the 20ft tree. Mr Burrough raced back, evaded police and scaled the tree again, joined by a second protester, Matthew Sell, 39.

They want to protect the tree – and a thriving colony of badgers beneath it.

Prime land: The apple tree is part of a site set to be turned into luxury homes

Support: Locals of Stroud, Gloucestershire, have shown their support for the protest

Supplies: Enthusiastic local supporters have been supplying Mr Burrough with soup, sandwiches and water

Teamwork: Mr Burrough was far from alone in his efforts

Developers want to build 14 luxury homes on the one-acre site at Stroud, near the childhood home of Cider With Rosie author Laurie Lee.

Mr Burrough said: ‘This is an old tree and the badger sett 
is unusually large. There’s a growing movement in Britain to save 
orchard trees and I personally want the badger sett fenced off as mini 
nature reserve rather than moved.

'Or why can’t they incorporate it as 
part of the houses’ gardens?

‘Just because something has been given 
planning permission doesn’t mean it’s correct. If more people did what 
I’m doing more often, councils would get a bit tired and change the 
rules so they can retract their decision.’

Poised: Developers are waiting to chop the tree down and continue building

The peculiarly English 
stand-off is happening on the edge of Stroud, Gloucestershire, on a 
patch of land which was in years gone by an orchard and a market garden,
 then became a much-loved green space which planning officers called the
 ‘last breathing space for local people’.

But
 planning permission to build the 12 three-bedroom and two four-bedroom 
houses in terrace blocks was granted to developer Gerry Walsh after he 
bought the land - despite more than 100 letters of objection about his 
controversial plans to Stroud District Council.

The
 site is just two miles from Slad, the village where Laurie Lee lived 
and around which he based his famous novel about his bucolic childhood, 
‘Cider With Rosie’, and in this little corner of the country feelings 
run high particularly about protecting the countryside and conserving 
nature.

Contractors began 
clearing the site a fortnight ago, but at first the 20ft apple tree 
remained intact thanks in no small part to Mr Burrough’s tree-scaling 
prowess.

Opposition: The local council received more than 100 letters opposing the development

A
 steady stream of locals have been supporting his cause by coming to the
 site with supplies for him and banners saying ‘Stroud apple town’ and 
‘Houses out, badger in’. Some children have made t-shirts with the logo 
‘Paws off our setts’.

Judith
 Pfeifer, 35, a landscape architect, whose home borders the site, said: 
‘I’m not against building homes, we need homes, but there should be 
space for wildlife as well - human habitation and precious wildlife 
should find a way to live together.

‘This
 was a wildlife haven and the apple tree was part of our heritage. It 
was so peaceful here before. Since the work began it feels like we’re 
under siege.’ Under the planning permission, Mr Walsh must leave a 2.5m 
wide dedicated ‘wildlife corridor’ along the western and southern 
boundaries of the site.

He
 has also been granted a licence from Natural England for the badgers to
 be moved. This is likely to be done by installing one-way gates over 
the 22 entrances to their sett so they can get out, but can’t go back in
 again.'

Battle ground: Neither side had showed any sign of relenting

It is expected they will then wander off and make a find a new home with another nearby colony.

Mr
 Walsh’s planning agent Ben Read, of Hunter Page Planning, said: ‘He is 
doing everything in accordance with the policies and has the necessary 
planning permissions and consents.

‘The trees were looked at as part of the planning application and no preservation orders were put in place.

'An ecologist was appointed to deal with badger relocation and is on site to make sure that everything is done correctly.’

After yesterday’s early morning drama, the contractors stopped working temporarily and a single bulldozer sat idle on the site.

A
 Gloucestershire Police spokesman confirmed that contractors started 
taking the apple tree down early yesterday when no one was in it, but 
two-thirds of the way into their work a protester climbed back up the 
tree.

He added: ‘No one 
was arrested or threatened with arrest. The Chief Inspector responsible 
for Stroud is meeting with the owner of the land and we believe that no 
action will be taken against any of the protesters because the 
contractors what things done as low key as possible.’

Developer Gerard Walsh said: 'I hope we can have a reasonable discussion with the guys up the tree and persuade them what we're doing is the best that could be hoped for from any developer on this site.'
