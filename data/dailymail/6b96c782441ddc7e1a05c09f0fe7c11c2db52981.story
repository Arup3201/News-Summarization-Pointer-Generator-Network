Rory McIlroy's father Gerry stands to collect £50,000 now his superstar son has won the British Open Championship - and three friends of his will also each collect £50,000 for the win they predicted 10 years ago.

And there will be a lot of other happy punters today now McIlroy has sealed the deal - including another two family friends from Holywood who are believed to be in line for £40,000 each on a Rory win.

Ten years ago, Gerry McIlroy placed a £100 bet at odds of 500/1 that his son would win the Open Championship's Claret Jug by the age of 25.

The bet was placed with remarkable prescience in 2004, when McIlroy was a 15-year-old prodigy. Three friends of McIlroy's father also bet £100 each (£100 was the most that the bookie's would allow).

A third Major victory at the age of 25 means McIlroy is now one of the all-time greats - as has completed three of four legs of a career grand slam, achieved only six times before in history.

Despite some confusion yesterday over the terms of his father's bet, it was confirmed by McIlroy's agent that the bet is for Rory McIlroy to win the Open by the age of 25, meaning before he turns 26.

He is 25 this year, having passed the milestone on May 4. McIlroy's agent said the bet was valid this year. 'This is the last year of the bet, so if Rory wins, Gerry wins,' he said at the time.

Andrew Cotter of the BBC also tweeted yesterday that he spoke to Gerry, who confirmed that the bet still stood.

Mr Cotter wrote: 'It was by the age of 25. So I asked the man himself. This year still counts.'

Gerry worked 100 hours a week and his wife Rosie did night shifts at a factory in their home of Holywood in County Down to save to send Rory to U.S. competitions as a junior.

When talk of the bet first emerged, Gerry was quoted as saying: 'It's ridiculous really, isn't it? You realise you can make more money on the golf tour in one week than some people make in a lifetime.'

When McIlroy won his first major championship, the U.S. Open, by a record margin in 2011, his father spoke about the bet.

He said: 'That was all the bookies would let us put on, £100 apiece. But that bet is looking better and better.'

A Ladbrokes 
spokesman said: 'The payout for Rory winning the tournament is 
approaching £2.5m, so it's safe to say that we won't be celebrating this
 time tomorrow.

'In fact, we'll be drowning our sorrows with a Guinness or two.'

It will not be the first time a fan of McIlroy has profited from his feats. One member of Holywood Golf Club had more reason than most to celebrate after his 2011 U.S. Open victory at Congressional.

He landed a small fortune, believed to be around £25,000, on a bet placed when McIlroy was a promising youngster.

It is understood the shrewd punter at McIlroy's home town club got odds of 500/1 when he put £50 on the teen prodigy to win a Major before age 25.

As it happened, McIlroy won his first Major at the age of 22.

After one of McIlroy's lap-the-field performances in the 2011 U.S. Open, another Irish great, Padraig Harrington, said: 'Rory has been lapping the field.

'There might be people capable of winning a Major, but there are not many people capable of dominating and running away from the field in a Major.'

McIlroy's victory today sees him join Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three majors by the age of 25.

Meanwhile, model Nadia Forde isn't there to cheer him on today, despite speculation that she might turn up. She is in Florida, where she is relaxing after her recent car crash.

There has been much speculation in recent weeks that the pair are an item. However, both have denied it. McIlroy recently broke off his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki amid a welter of publicity.
