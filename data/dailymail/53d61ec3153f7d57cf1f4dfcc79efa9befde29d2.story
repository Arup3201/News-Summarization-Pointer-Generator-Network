Aristocratic bad boy Lord Brocket has failed in his latest attempt to seize £2million worth of antiques and artworks from his family home.

The controversial peer sent a fleet of removal vans to Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire, claiming he has a legal right to remove the valuables from the building.

However, the lorries were unable to gain entry to the stately home, and were sent away again empty-handed.

Denied: Security guards sent the vans away claiming they had no right to access the antiques up for dispute

Lord Brocket, 62, who was jailed for insurance fraud during the 1990s, has leased out Brocket Hall as a conference centre and golf course for nearly 20 years.

The home's antiques are leased to a company owned by German hotelier Dieter Klostermann - but Lord Brocket claims the businessman has failed to keep up payments, and is demanding the objects be returned to the family trust which owns them.

Among the valuable items at stake in the dispute are a painting by Van Dyck, the table from the home's ballroom and other items of furniture.

Earlier this year, a convoy of removal vans was stopped on the motorway after trying to take what Lord Brocket claims he is owed. 

In yesterday's incident, a fleet of four vans turned up outside the hall demanding to gain entry, but the removal men were ordered to leave by security after a half-hour stand-off - as officials at the hall said they needed the items for a Christmas party attended by the Arsenal football team.

Lord Brocket, who was not present at the scene of the dispute, said: 'The problem is that this is theft, this is not their furniture. It is mine and they are using it to run a business. They agreed we could go in at 8.30 but yet again they changed their mind.'

He added: 'The trustees of the Brocket Estate are criminally liable if they fail to maintain the listed buildings and contents.

'Buildings have collapsed, original fixtures ripped out of buildings and original candelabras made for the ballroom destroyed. In 2012 the tenant was served with a £7.2million bill due to dilapidations.

'On November 20, 2013 the licence to the tenant of Brocket Hall to use the contents of the hall ended following numerous failures to pay rent and damage to various contents.

'The contents are owned by the trustees of Brocket Hall. Since that day the tenant has unlawfully withheld the contents in order to rent out Brocket Hall as a furnished venue and this is regarded as theft.'

Mix-up: A representative for Lord Brocket said he thought the estate had agreed to allow entry

The company running Brocket Hall has said that some of the objects may legally have to remain in the home because of its status as a grade I listed building.

A spokesman said: 'Brocket Hall International have been working closely with Welwyn Hatfield Council and English Heritage with reference to the artwork located in the Hall.

'Both the council and English Heritage are in the process of deciding whether various items benefit from the property’s grade one listing, in relation to their annexation or historical significance.

'We have contacted the estate's trustees with regards to the procedure for collection of any items that do not benefit from the listing, however BHI never gave permission for any items to be removed yesterday.

'Lord Brocket wants to operate outside of the law - we are not prepared to do this.'

Property manager Stuart Gray, who has been representing the peer in the dispute, told the Evening Standard that he thought there had been an 'understanding' that the removal vans would be given access to Brocket Hall.

But Jim Moore, the property's financial director, told the paper: 'We don't owe the trust a penny.'

Lord Brocket first had to lease out his ancestral home in 1996, shortly after he was jailed for scamming insurers out of £4.5million over a fleet of classic cars.

The property is rented by Brocket Hall International, part of Mr Klostermann's company CCA International, while the contents are leased out under a separate contract. 

The company did not respond for a request for comment on the legal dispute with Lord Brocket. 

Brocket Hall was built in 1760, and has previously been home to prime ministers and members of the royal family.

Lord Brocket's ancestors bought the home around a century ago, and the current lord took possession when he inherited his title in 1971.

The Old Etonian served as an Army officer before gaining a reputation as a playboy and car enthusiast, but was ruined by his five-year prison sentence.

In the past decade he has reinvented himself as a television personality, appearing on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! and other reality programmes.
