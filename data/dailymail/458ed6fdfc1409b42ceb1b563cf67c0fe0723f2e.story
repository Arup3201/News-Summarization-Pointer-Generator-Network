A pet stingray called Steve Irwin sunk its 3-inch barb into his owner just days after the man bought it.

Owner James Hunt, 23, was in hospital for three days after he was attacked by his newly-bought venomous motoro stingray.

Mr Hunt was moving the stingray from one tank to another at his flat in Southend, Essex when the usually placid sea creature attacked, leaving Mr Hunt in excruciating pain.

'Felt like I was dying': James Hunt spent three days in hospital after his new pet stingray, ironically named Steve Irwin, attacked him with its 3-inch barb

Ironically, the pet was named after the gregarious Australian wildlife expert Steve Irwin, who was tragically killed by a stingray in 2006.

Mr Hunt said: ‘I felt like I was dying. The pain in my arm was excruciating.

‘I was in agony. The intense pain was spreading from my wrist to my elbow, then it started going towards my shoulder.

He was rushed to hospital where he doctors treated the painful symptoms from the 
stingray’s barbed stinger following the incident on Bank Holiday Monday 
in late August.

Luckily for
 Mr Hunt, his partner Danielle Wright, 22, and his brother Shane, 30 and
 his partner Victoria Long, 27, were with him at the time.

He said: ‘I am just thankful I wasn’t on my own.

‘They gave me oxygen and morphine in hospital, but I was still screaming in pain. I must have sounded like I was in labour.

‘I remember asking the doctors to not let me die, but I tried to keep calm because if you panic it makes the venom spread faster.’

Tragic death: The real Steve Irwin, an Australian wildlife expert, was killed by a stingray in 2006

Steve Irwin was one of two 15-inch stingrays that Mr Hunt had bought for £150 from a private seller on August 25.

He was attempting to move the rays to a new 6ft, 1000-litre tank the next day when disaster struck.

Mr Hunt said: ‘I had just moved down from Sunderland to Southend with my partner and bought them from someone in Derbyshire on the way down.

‘I picked them up and put them in a tank when we moved into the flat and there was no problem, but I think they must have been a bit tired because of the journey.

‘The next day they had more energy and I got one out of the tank and got half way to the other one when it stung me with its barb.’

The pet owner, who has kept fish for five years, told how his stingrays shared a tank with other tropical species including two oscars, a black belt, a red devil, a pleco and a red tail catfish.

And despite a painful start, Mr Hunt intends to keep the stingrays.

He said: ‘It was my fault. I knew they could be dangerous and I just took a chance.

‘I was tired from the move and only had three hours sleep. I won’t be doing that again. 

‘The swelling has gone down a bit, but my hand is still pretty numb.’

Mr Hunt, who is unemployed, faces several weeks of physiotherapy and is on a course of antibiotics to ensure the wound does not become infected.

Steve Irwin was killed in September 2006 after getting stung by a stingray while filming in Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

The 44-year-old was setting up to shoot ocean reef footage at the time for a programme on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef he was making with his daughter Bindi who was eight at the time.

There was no evidence that he provoked the attack. The fatal blow was caught on videotape 
and showed Irwin swimming over the top of the ray as the tail came up 
and spiked him in the chest. Irwin instinctively pulled the barb out of 
his chest and died shortly after.

Several stingrays were found dead and 
mutilated on Australia's eastern coast in apparent revenge attacks on 
the normally docile fish.

Since Irwin’s death his family has continued his legacy.

His daughter Bindi, now 15, has appeared on television since she was two. Already an accomplished wildlife conservationist, she went on to front her own show: Bindi the Jungle Girl, and has also appeared in movies such as Free Willy: Escape from Pirate’s Cove and Return to Nim’s Island.

Wife Terri Irwin now owns the Australia Zoo, the Irwin family reptile and fauna park where Irwin grew up.

Born in 1962, Irwin lived in the tropical Queensland state where his parents ran a small reptile and fauna park. He grew up near crocodiles, trapping and removing them from populated areas and releasing them in his parent's park.

In 1991 he took over the park and started ‘The Crocodile Hunter’ television programme which received a worldwide audience of 200 million, equivalent to 10 times the population of Australia.

He made 46 of the popular documentaries which appeared on cable TV channel Animal Planet, as well as more than 20 episodes of ‘The Crocodile Hunter Diaries’. In 2001, he appeared alongside Eddie Murphy in the Hollywood movie Dr Dolittle 2.

Stingrays are usually shy, unobtrusive fish that rummage along the sea bottom for food or burrow into the sand.

When stepped on or otherwise frightened, a serrated spine up to 10 inches long in the animal's tail flares up. The spines emit toxins that can kill small creatures and cause excruciating pain in humans.

Few people die from the poison, but the spines can badly tear flesh and the wounds are prone to infections, including tetanus.
