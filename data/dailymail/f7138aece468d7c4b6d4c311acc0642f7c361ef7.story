Out: Michael Gove paid the price for his 'toxic' public image which was blamed for turning voters against his school reforms 

Michael Gove was demoted yesterday as David Cameron’s election guru Lynton Crosby engineered a ruthless elevation of women and Eurosceptics.

The Education Secretary, a hero for the Tory Right, paid the price for his ‘toxic’ public image which was blamed for turning voters against his school reforms.

To the alarm of education reformers, he was shifted to become chief whip – a position hailed as ‘one of the most important jobs’ in government by David Cameron, but one which will mean a substantial pay cut and an end to his full Cabinet status.

Mr Gove’s former aide, Dominic Cummings, accused the Prime Minister of ‘surrender’.

The populist hand of Mr Crosby, the Tories’ Australian chief election strategist, was detected across yesterday’s reshuffle. Designed to turn the Tory top team into an ‘election-winning machine’, it was by far the most extensive shake-up Mr Cameron has carried out in his nine years as party leader.

A succession of telegenic women – including two working mothers, Elizabeth Truss and Nicky Morgan – won big promotions.

At 38, Miss Truss, tipped as a potential future party leader, became the youngest woman Cabinet minister ever, while Mrs Morgan will replace Mr Gove as Education Secretary.

Philip Hammond, appointed as Foreign Secretary after William Hague stood down to become leader of the Commons, was hailed as the most Eurosceptic holder of the post since the Second World War.

Opponents of Tory plans to reform European human rights laws, including Attorney General Dominic Grieve, were swept away.

In all, 11 male ministers, most of them middle-aged, jumped before they were pushed or were sacked by Mr Cameron. His most difficult exchange is understood to have been with outgoing Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, whose dismissal infuriated some on the Right of the party.

The biggest shock was the move out of education for Mr Gove, one of the Prime Minister’s oldest friends and allies.

Just weeks ago, Mr Cameron appeared to guarantee him his job during exchanges at Prime Minister’s Questions.

Mr Gove, the architect of the Government’s
 new free schools, funded by the state but unshackled from council 
control, told allies just days ago that he was going nowhere.

But senior figures in Downing Street, including chief of staff Ed Llewellyn, are understood to have been increasingly exasperated by Mr Gove’s public battles with colleagues.

In recent months, he has clashed with education minister David Laws and Home Secretary Theresa May, and has maintained a constant state of warfare with an education establishment he branded ‘The Blob’.

Mr Crosby is thought to have pointed to polling evidence suggesting Mr Gove’s unpopularity had spread beyond teachers and was contaminating the Government’s education message more widely.

One recent YouGov poll showed voters now oppose schools becoming academies by 41 per cent to 31 per cent and Mr Gove’s flagship free schools project by 53 per cent to 23 per cent.

Other polling evidence showed the Education Secretary had become one of the most recognisable members of the Government – equal only to Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne – but by far its most unpopular senior minister.

Within the past few days Mr Cameron is understood to have spoken to Mr Gove to suggest a move to replace Sir George Young, the outgoing chief whip, who is in charge of party discipline. Traditionally, the role is conducted out of public view, but the Prime Minister sought to sweeten the pill by promising Mr Gove he would be one of his main election advisers and would appear regularly in the media.

Former Tory whip Sir Greg Knight said: ‘If the spin is true and we have a chief whip who regularly addresses the nation, I think this will prove a mistake.’

There were claims – hotly disputed by the Treasury – that George Osborne initially opposed the idea of a move for the Education Secretary, who has emerged as the unofficial head of the Chancellor’s campaign to succeed Mr Cameron.  

Britain's teachers wasted no time in gloating over Michael Gove’s demotion yesterday, going online to share expletive-filled insults and pictures of voodoo dolls to send the Education Secretary on his way.

Within hours of the shock announcement, #GoveGone was trending on Twitter amid reports of teachers cheering, ‘weeping with joy’ and high-fiving each other in the corridors of schools around the country.

One staff room reportedly even brought out ‘the posh biscuits’ to celebrate.

A knitted doll of Mr Gove, stuck with pins, was tweeted by @HPUKStudents, with the message: ‘Nicky Morgan replaces Gove as education secretary. Probably won’t need this any more then.’

Opponents were also encouraged to attack him on Twitter via an online game called ‘Slap Michael Gove’, which saw him being struck hundreds of thousands of times yesterday. There were also mocked-up photos of Mr Gove receiving an ‘F’ in his exam results and being ‘sent to the naughty step’, while he was even likened to a sexually transmitted disease.

Trade unionists could not contain their glee as they claimed the NUT strike last week, which caused disruption to thousands of parents and pupils, had successfully ousted Mr Gove.

An NUT poster was circulated online, stating: ‘Your pressure has had an impact. Government policy must now urgently change.’

Asked if the change of job represented a ‘punishment’, Mr Cameron insisted: ‘I can tell you, if you are Prime Minister, the chief whip is one of the most important jobs in government. I wanted one of my big hitters, one of my real stars, one of my great brains, someone who has done extraordinary things for education in this country, to do that job, to deliver the Government’s programme, to help secure the future for our country.’

He said he was proud to lead ‘a fresh team with the ideas, the energy and the ability to take this country forward’.

Aides 
insisted Mrs Morgan was ‘100 per cent’ behind Mr Gove’s reforms. Mr Gove
 insisted the Prime Minister had given him the choice of taking charge 
of the whips’ office or staying where he was. He appeared unaware that 
the move will mean taking a pay cut – from £141,647 to £103,937.

He
 admitted: ‘It’s naturally a wrench to be moved from a job I love … 
Demotion, emotion, locomotion, whatever I’m engaged in today, I’m 
pushing forward the Government’s agenda.’

There was dismay on the Right of the Conservative Party at his move. Senior MPs questioned why Miss Truss, who was Mr Gove’s deputy as schools minister, had not been promoted to take the job if there was no desire to signal a break with his agenda.

There were indications on unhappiness in the party at the scale of Mr Cameron’s purge. Centrists were dismayed at the departure of pro-European veteran Kenneth Clarke, Mr Grieve, who had defended the European court of human rights, and climate change minister Greg Barker.

Former Tory MP Louise Mensch claimed the ‘desire for publicity’ of Mr Gove’s former aide Mr Cummings, who has been scathing about Mr Cameron and his senior officials, had ‘got the best education secretary we’ve ever had sacked’.

Mr Cummings dismissed that accusation and suggested instead it was a surprise that Mr Gove had lasted so long.

He added: ‘We got away with subverting every Whitehall and Number Ten process, and it took David Cameron four years to surrender. We assumed he would in 2012 and 2013.’
