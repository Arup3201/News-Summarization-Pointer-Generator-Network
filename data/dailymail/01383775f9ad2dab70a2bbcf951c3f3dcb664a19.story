A creep with a fetish for Swiss cheese is terrorizing Philadelphia.

Dubbed the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert,' the overweight man in his 40s has been spotted on multiple occasions in the Mayfair area approaching women while driving his car with his genitals exposed.

According to his victims, he then dangles a large slice of Swiss cheese over his penis and offers to pay the women to perform sexual acts on him using the fromage.

The Mayfair Town Watch warned local ladies of the lurking man on its Facebook page Saturday, and Philadelphia Police Department has confirmed the Special Victims Unit is investigating the curious case after several women filed reports describing a man with a 'major sexual cheese fetish.'

'I understand that people may think this is funny, but this is no laughing matter,' Milt Martelack, the town watch's senior adviser, told the Philadelphia Daily News.

'We've had a couple individuals reach out to us. We're taking this matter very seriously, and we're working vigorously with police to get this guy off the streets.'

The 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' is heavyset and white and drives a silver or black sedan.

The bizarre case shocked many residents but Gabby Chest, from nearby Bridesburg, recognized the fetish straight away and made her own report to police.

In July 2012, when she was just 19, she set up a profile on dating site OkCupid and within days had an inbox from a 'really strange guy' with a very specific request.

'He said he was looking for someone to perform masturbation on him with cheese,' Ms Chest told the Daily News. 'He kept saying how strong his urges were and how desperate he was to find someone to help him with them.'

She added: 'There's no doubt it was him; it looked exactly like the picture on his profile. I was scared and shocked. I never thought the guys you see on those sites would be so close to me.'

Swiss is best: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best,' 'Chris' wrote in an OKCupid message to a 19-year-old girl (stock photo)

In the message, the man called 
'Chris' explained he developed the fetish after struggling to find women
 and start relationships as a young man because he was overweight and 
always judged on his looks.

'So I developed this fetish to help me deal with my sexual urges,' he wrote.

'I found that women tend to like dairy products, and settled on cheese to represent the girl. thus I started having sex with cheese.'

Another woman, commenting on a Phillymag.com story, shared an OKCupid message her sister received from 'Chris' some four years ago, which was even more shocking.

'I love the way Swiss cheese feels against my penis. Either as slices of Swiss cheese being wrapped around my penis or a chunk of Swiss cheese being rubbed against my penis,' he wrote.

'I love even more when a woman uses the Swiss cheese to pleasure me. Or simply wraps Swiss cheese slices around my penis and allows me to hang out with her as I wear the cheese.'

He explained that he prefers having sex with cheese over traditional sex and jokes 'I am lucky I never became a rapist,' suggesting this was an alternative to his fromage infatuation.

Chis went on: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best. First and foremost, if ever a picture of cheese is used, most of the time they use a representation of Swiss cheese. But also because of it's eye patterns, texture, and the way it feels against my penis.'

While he didn't offer Ms Chest cash in exchange for the sexual favor, so as not to suggest she was a prostitute, he did offer this young woman $50 if she'd pleasure him using his preferred method.

He described in the expansive letter, however, that when he was younger he had far more stamina for cheese sex.

'I was able to wrap and wear a good 1 Â½ pounds of Swiss cheese against my penis, and wear the Swiss cheese for hours at a time, before I would climax from just having the Swiss cheese on my penis,' Chris wrote.

But in a strange twist, he insists he doesn't like Swiss cheese, only mozzarella, and would never consumer the cheese he has used on himself.

'One last note, I do not like cheese, except for mozzarella, and that is the one cheese I have never used on myself,' he explained. 'So no I do not eat the cheese after I am done using it for pleasure, it is discarded. I am always asked that question.'
