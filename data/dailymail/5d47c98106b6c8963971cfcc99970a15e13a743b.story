Andy Murray is continuing his pre-season training in Dubai as the British No 1 steps up his preparations for the Australian Open.

After several weeks at his training base in Miami, followed by a few days in Scotland for Christmas, Murray is now in the United Arab Emirates ahead of his first match of the new year on Thursday.

Murray takes on Spaniard Feliciano Lopez at the Mubadala World Tennis Championship exhibition event in Abu Dhabi, with the winner going on to face Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals the following day.

The Scot is also due to represent Great Britain, along with Heather Watson, in the Hopman Cup team event in Perth from January 5, before the first Grand Slam of the year gets underway in Melbourne on January 19.

Murray has spent the off-season training with British No 2 James Ward, who is facing a tense wait to find out if he will get direct entry into the main draw of the Australian Open.

Ward's ranking of No 107 was not high enough to earn him an automatic spot when the initial entry list was released but a number of withdrawals since means that he is now third alternate.
