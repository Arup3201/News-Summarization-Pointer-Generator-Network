When Texas toddler Natalie Newton slipped in a pool and suffered severe brain damage doctors were unable to save her, or provide a humane way to end her suffering.

With no way to revive Natalie, known as Natty to her family, all the hospital was able to do was to withhold nutrition.

The family of the 21-month-old girl had to watch helplessly as she starved to death over nine days,
 and they are now campaigning to make euthanasia legal in the state.

Painful loss: Natalie Newton, known as Natty, was left with a brain injury after falling in a pool

Traumatic: When doctors couldn't save Natty her feeding tube was removed to allow her to die

Natty was 19 months old when she stumbled into a pool at the family home last year, and suffered an anoxic brain injury.

The hospital that treated her tried an experimental treatment to revive the little girl, but although she survived the procedure she was left blind, deaf, paralyzed and suffering from seizures.

She managed to recover from some of the symptoms over the next month, but she was given only a 4 per cent chance of surviving the year.

With her suffering more seizures, organ failure and other complications, the hospital's Ethics Committee ruled that End of Life was the most humane course for Natty.

However, the only way that can be carried out in Texas is by removing life support or, as the Newton family said: 'Essentially, if we wanted to put a stop to her suffering, we would had to starve her to death.'

Heartbreaking: The happy and healthy little girl wasted away before her family's eyes

The ethics committee at Corpus Christi Hospital recommended End of Life was the best option for Natty

'I had no idea, no idea, what my family was about to endure,' Natty's grandfather, Bradley Newton, told ABC 7. 'It was just horrible. Blind and deaf and can't move.'

In Texas euthanasia is illegal but the Newton family believe those in a similar situation to what they faced should be given some choice. 

Mr Newton told Click2Houston the nine days of suffering Natty endured could have been replaced with 30 seconds of a medically-induced, less painful death.

'It should be right to choose to let them go quickly and peacefully,' he said.

The family were so traumatized by watching their beautiful little girl wither away over nine agonizing days, that they are campaigning to make what is already a heartbreaking situation more dignified for others.

'We euthanize dogs for humanity 
reasons, we euthanize serial killers but, a 21-month old baby has to 
starve for almost nine days,' Mr Newton said.

Campaign: A foundation has been set up in Natalie's name to campaign for euthanasia laws to change

The family are raising awareness for 
the Campaign For Dignity in Dying, which proposes legalizing assisted 
dying in certain cases.

On
 the family's The Natty Foundation website they blamed the current 
'barbaric law' for 'forcing tens of thousands of Americans every single 
year to choose between insufferable agony or the undignified sadness of 
starvation'.

The process of
 ending a terminally ill patient's life by removing their feeding tube 
is said to be humane, but the Newtons said it was a harrowing 
experience.

Natty lost half her body weight and became increasingly delirious. She became 'nothing but a shell of the little girl, that a few short months ago, filled our lives with laughter and happiness,' her family said.

But neurologist Sarah Austin, who works with terminal patients, said legalizing euthanasia could be a slippery slope.

'When do you decide that this is the right time to hasten their death? ...  I think you do better to allow that process to go on naturally and make people comfortable in the process,' she said.

In Texas, that meant removing a feeding tube and waiting for girl to starve
