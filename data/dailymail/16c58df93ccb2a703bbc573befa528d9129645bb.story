Parents have poured scorn on a Labour MP after she claimed children are no longer interested in Lego.

Stella Creasy, 37, said that at Christmas her young nieces and a nephew refused to build a Lego toy of the Death Star from the Star Wars films.

Speaking at a conference last week, she said: ‘They weren’t interested. I realised that for them, a toy which involves following instructions just doesn’t cut it any more.’

TV star Kirstie Allsopp, 43, a mother of four, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This is hands down the daftest comment I’ve ever heard. My two sons are eight and six and they love Lego – our house is full of it.

‘I’ve got 12 or 13 godchildren, as well as nieces and nephews, and not a single one of them doesn’t like Lego.’

Cathy Ranson, editor-in-chief of website Netmums, said that the £275 Death Star set was aimed at Lego fans aged 14 or older.

‘It wouldn’t have been that easy for younger children to work out,’ she said.

Last year Lego overtook Mattel to become the world’s largest toy manufacturer as the Danish company’s UK sales hit a record £226 million.

And last week Lego was named as one of the 50 greatest toys of all time in a survey of industry executives.
