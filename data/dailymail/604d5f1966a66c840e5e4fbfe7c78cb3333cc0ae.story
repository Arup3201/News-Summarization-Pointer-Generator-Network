Terrified passengers were pictured 
fleeing from the stricken plane, with many waiting on its wings as 
rescuers launched a dramatic rescue effort.

Dewi, a passenger who 
sustained head wounds in the crash, relived the horrific moment the plane crashed into the water: 'The 
aircraft was in landing position when suddenly I saw it getting closer 
to the sea, and finally it hit the water.

'All of 
the passengers were screaming in panic in fear they would drown. I left 
behind my belongings and went to an emergency door. I got out of the 
plane and swam before rescuers jumped in to help me.'

The airport is known for its runway which extends out into the ocean.

Scary: The plane skidded off the runway and landed in shallow water. Passengers made their way back to shore in yellow dinghies

The plane which crashed was owned by Lion Air, whose company motto is: We Make People Fly.

It is Indonesia's largest privately-run airline company, securing the largest share of the domestic market.

The operator is currently banned from flying with the European Union because of concerns over its safety levels.

The
 company has recently been involved in a scandal - in January last year 
Indonesia's Transportation Ministry said that a number 
of crew members had been found in possession of crystal meth. Their 
licences were revoked.

The
 airline flies to major cities around Indonesia, as well as other routes
 in South East Asia, taking passengers to Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia 
and even Saudi Arabia.

Established in 1999, the company started out using a single Boeing 737-200.

Lion
 Air is a low-cost carrier that holds about a 45 percent market share in
 Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago that's seeing a boom in both 
economic growth and air travel. 

Lion inked a $24 billion deal last 
month to buy 234 Airbus planes, the biggest order ever for the French 
aircraft maker. It also gave Boeing its largest-ever order when it 
finalized a deal for 230 planes last year. The planes will be delivered 
from 2014 through 2026.

Many of the passengers escaped through emergency doors which opened 
half way along the fuselage and made their way to the shore in 
inflatable yellow dinghies.

After being evacuated off the plane, they were taken to the airport terminal for treatment.

Airport officials said that 
several people were injured in the crash, but the extent of their 
injuries were not known.

Lion Air is currently banned from flying with the European Union because of concerns over its safety levels.

Pictures from the scene show the 
passenger jet with its distinctive red Lion name on the side lying 
partially submerged in the water near rocks at the end of the runway.

The
 plane had broken its back - the rear section drooped further into the 
water and a large split could be seen in the last portion of the jet.

Other passengers milled about at the airport as police and officials
 attempted to establish what had happened to cause the jet to crash into
 the sea.

Bali Police Chief Arif Wahyunadi said: 'All passengers and crew have been taken off the aircraft as it lies in the sea.

'They are being attended to at the airport.'

Up to 45 people were taken to several different hospitals for treatment.

I Made Krisna Maharta, an official with Bali's search and rescue agency,
 said all of the passengers and crew were safely rescued. He
 said initial reports showed there were 101 passengers and seven crew 
members aboard the plane.

Mr Wahyunadi said the jet had originated in the city of Bandung, 
Indonesia's third largest city - a tourist attraction because of its 
ancient architecture.

Frightening: More than 20 people were taken to three different hospitals with various injuries

Pain: Although no passengers died during the crash, many were hurt, including this man

A photo on TV One shows the plane sitting on top of the water.

An official at Bali's international airport said: 'We believe all the
 passengers and crew are safe. They are currently being attended to by 
medical staff, police and airline officials.

The 
Transportation Ministry's director general of aviation, Harry Bakti 
Gumay, said the plane overshot the runway and fell into the sea from a 
height of about 50 meters (55 yards).

The cause of the accident was 
unclear, and Gumay said an investigation was under way.

Accident: The plane crashed as it came into land at Ngurah Rai Airport, near Denparsar. As this image shows, its runway extends out into the sea

Disaster: Local residents stand outside the fence at Bali's international airport  after news that a plane missed the runway and crashed into the sea

Interest: Concerned local residents look towards the airport following news of the plane crash

'We will know what happened later but it appears the aircraft 
overshot the runway. Fortunately it has come down in shallow water.'

Bali is a popular holiday getaway for Britons and other Europeans looking to escape the cold northern hemisphere weather.

Indonesia has a bad record for air 
crashes, many of the airlines using second or third hand aircraft 
purchased after other countries have finished with them.

Ngurah Rai Airport is Indonesia's second-busiest international airport. 

The airport is named after I Gusti Ngurah Rai, an Indonesian National Hero who died in November 1946.

It is not known if any Britons were on board the Lion Air jet.
