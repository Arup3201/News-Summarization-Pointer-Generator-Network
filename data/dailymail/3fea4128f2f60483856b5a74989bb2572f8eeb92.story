Pakistan comprehensively overcame New Zealand by seven wickets in their first T20 international in Dubai.

The Black Caps' 135 for seven at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium proved a relatively straightforward chase for Pakistan, with victory wrapped up with five balls to spare.

Opener Sarfraz Ahmed was the star of the show with an unbeaten 76 off 64 balls - the highest T20 score by a Pakistani wicketkeeper.

The teams go again in Sharjah on Friday to complete the two-match series, when New Zealand will be hoping for a much better start.

Just three overs in, the score was 15 for three after captain Kane Williamson and Anton Devcich were both trapped lbw by Anwar Ali and Sohail Tanvir respectively, with Ross Taylor following soon after when he was caught by Umar Akmal off Mohammad Irfan

Martin Guptill (32) and Corey Anderson (48) tried to launch a fightback, with Luke Ronchi (33) joining the latter to rack up a half-century partnership off 32 balls.

However, when the in-form Anderson, having struck four sixes and a four, was caught off the bowling of Raza Hasan just short of his half-century, Pakistan were able to limit their opponents to just 135.

It was a figure Shahid Afridi's men made light work of, thanks in no small part to Sarfraz's impressive display.

Having previously batted just once in four previous T20 internationals, he shone at the top of the order with eight fours and two sixes.

He put on 51 for the first wicket with Awais Zia before losing his opener partner to a run out, while Mohammad Hafeez departed in similar fashion soon after having contributed just two to the total.

However, New Zealand could only make one more breakthrough - Haris Sohail going for 11 - and Akmal (27no) joined forces with Sarfraz to take Pakistan home, the latter hitting the winning runs with a six off Jimmy Neesham's first ball of the game.
