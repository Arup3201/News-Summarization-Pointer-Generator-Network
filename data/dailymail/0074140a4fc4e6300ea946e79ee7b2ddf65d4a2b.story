Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger felt bad memories of last season's 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Liverpool might have affected some of his players during Sunday's 2-2 draw at Anfield.

Brendan Rodgers' side were dominant in the opening half but both sides went into the break level at 1-1, a stark contrast to the last time the two sides met in February - when Liverpool were already leading 4-0.

This time around Olivier Giroud looked to have given Arsenal a welcome three points with his second-half goal, but Martin Skrtel's injury-time equaliser earned the hosts a share of the spoils - leaving the Gunners four points off fourth-placed West Ham as a result.

After the game Gunners boss Wenger admitted his side played with too much anxiety throughout, sitting off their opposition far too much as a result.

He said: 'We had problems to get our flow going.

'We did not have enough possession in the game. In the first half it was down to tactical and some psychological reasons: maybe bad memories from last year. Some players were not at their best.

'I felt we played with the handbrake too much, in the first half especially, in the second half we played much better but at 2-1 we sat back too much.

'When you don't score goal number three you are under threat to concede a second.'

Wenger, too, was unhappy with his side's defending throughout the game.

He added: 'Overall I think once they were down to 10 men they were not dangerous any more.

'To concede the corner that was a bit unlucky but then we didn't jump with Skrtel.

'Overall it is a fair result but a frustrating result for us because they came back when we had plenty of defenders on the pitch and could have defended the set-piece much better.'
