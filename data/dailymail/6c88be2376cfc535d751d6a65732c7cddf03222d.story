Two satellites being used in a £4.4bn European project to develop a satellite navigation system which rivals the American GPS network have gone into the wrong orbit.

Arianespace, the company responsible for
 the launch, said the satellites 'had been placed on a lower orbit than 
expected', after being fired into space yesterday on a Russian-made Soyuz rocket from French Guiana. 

The European Space Agency said space officials are now 
investigating whether the mistake will 
complicate their efforts to develop the publicly-funded Galileo satellite navigation 
system.

Two satellites being used in a European project which aims to rival the American GPS satellite navigation system, which were launched from French Guiana on Friday, pictured left and right, have gone into the wrong orbit, according to the European Space Agency 

It is not clear whether the satellites will be able to work properly in the different orbit, nor whether the orbits are now able to be corrected.

The satellites, Doresa and Milena, were fired into space after a 24-hour delay caused by bad weather. They are the fifth and sixth satellites to be launched for the ESA’s geo-positioning network.

The first two were launched in 2011, followed by another pair in 2012. The latest two satellites were already more than one year behind schedule.

The £4.4bn project, funded and owned by the European Union, is intended to provide Europe with an 
independent alternative in case of signal failure on the existing U.S. 
global positioning system or on Russia’s Glonass system.

The project 
will apparently create 15,000 to 20,000 jobs within the EU, according to the ESA.

In total, the Galileo network aims to have 30 operating satellites by 2017. Arianespace recently announced it would launch a further 12 satellites from the start of next year.

The statement did not explain the difference between the satellites' intended orbits and the one in which it was placed.  Space officials are now investigating whether the inaccurate deployment will complicate efforts to create the new £4.4bn Galileo satellite navigation system 

The satellites, Doresa and Milena, were the fifth and sixth to be 
launched for the ESA's geo-positioning network, being funded and run by the European Union. The first two were 
launched in 2011 while another was launched in 2012

Jean-Yves Le Gall, president of the French space agency CNES, said the investigation still needed to determine precisely how far off course the satellites were.

He said European Space Agency experts in Toulouse, France, and Darmstadt, Germany, were calculating whether small motors inside the satellites would be strong enough to push them into the correct orbit.

Mr Le Gall said the investigation would take 'several days to understand what has happened'. He said only then would they be able to see the possible consequences on the launch calendar.

He called the Galileo navigation network 'a very complex programme' and said failures were 'unfortunately part of the life of operations'.

If the two satellites cannot be pushed to the correct altitude above the earth, he said, subsequent satellites launched would have to take up the slack.

The programme has faced other delays and operational hiccups. European Space Agency officials said on Wednesday they had to reduce the strength of another Galileo satellite's signal because of unspecified problems.

Galileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) currently being built by the European Space Agency on behalf of the European Union (EU).

The project, expected to cost the EU £4.4bn, aims to create a system which will work with GPS and Glonass, the US and Russian global satellite navigation systems.

According to the EU, Galileo - which is named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei - will aim to provide an 'alternative high-precision positioning system' under civilian control.

It has been designed so European nations can rely on the system in case either of the existing systems fail, or are disabled by their operators.

The ESA says the system, which will be used to guide cars, run trains and land aircraft, carries more precise atomic clocks than GPS and will work at higher latitudes than other positioning systems.

In theory, the data transmitted by Galileo should therefore be significantly better than GPS. Whereas a position fixed by that signal might have an error of about 10m, Galileo's designers are aiming for a one metre margin of error once there is full deployment.

For its operation, Galileo will use two ground operations centres, near Munich in Germany and in Fucino in Italy. In December 2010, EU ministers in Brussels voted that Prague should be the headquarters of the Galileo project.

On 21 October 2011, the first two of four operational satellites, designed to validate the Galileo concept in both space and on Earth, were fired into space. Two more followed on 12 October 2012. 

The fully deployed Galileo system is due to consists of 30 satellites (27 of which will operational and three of which are spares), positioned in three circular Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) planes at 23,222 km altitude above the Earth. 

The latest launch was about one year behind schedule. Ongoing running costs, including the renewal of worn out spacecraft, are estimated to be about 800 million euros a year.

But the EU maintains this expenditure will be outweighed by the economic returns of having improved sat-nav. It expects Galileo to bring significant returns to European nations through new businesses that use precise location data.

Galileo was famously called the 'Common 
Agricultural Policy in the sky' by one British politician who was 
infuriated by the price of the project.
