Hannah Anderson and her father are in negotiations with NBC over a documentary about the California teenager's kidnapping ordeal, in a deal that could earn the family $100,000.

The network, which had an exclusive interview with Hannah after her dramatic rescue from a family friend-turned kidnapper who killed her mother and brother, has confirmed it is in talks about a show.

Although the network didn't pay the 16-year-old for an interview she did in August, she could expect a substantial sum for future work with a production company connected to NBC.

Deal: NBC is said to be negotiating a deal with Hannah Anderson for a documentary about her abduction

Sources told the Washington Post that Hannah
 and her father Brett 'could receive more than $100,000 for their cooperation in the making of a documentary or some other nonfiction program'.

The new head of NBC, Deborah Turness, hailed the exclusive interviews with Hannah as a 'major coup' after the teenager was featured on Today, Nightly News and Dateline NBC.

On Tuesday, the network announced it was in negotiations with the family to create a longer program about Hannah's abduction by James Lee DiMaggio Jr.

It hit back at claims that it was using 'check book journalism' and confirmed that neither Hannah or her father had been paid for the interviews in August and October.

Network spokesman Ali Zelenko told the the Post: 'NBC News never pays for interviews.'

The proposed project however will be created by Peacock Productions, and the Andersons would be compensated for use of 'footage and personal material', according to Vanity Fair.Â

Hannah's public accounts of her abduction have been the focus of intense public scrutiny.

The teenager was drugged and zip tied by DiMaggio, and spent a week in the wilderness with him after he killed her mother and eight-year-old brother Ethan, and set fire to the house they were in on August 4.

Her version of events have been described as suspicious by some people, including criminal profiler Chelsea Hoffman who has already released a book about the abduction called The River of No Return: On the Trail of Hannah Anderson and Jim DiMaggio.
