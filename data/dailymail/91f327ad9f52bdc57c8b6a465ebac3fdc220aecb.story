Cambridge head coach Richard Money has called for home supporters to believe that his side can beat the mighty Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday night.

The lowest ranked team remaining in the FA Cup are determined to showcase their ability against the 11-time winners at The R Costings Abbey Stadium, which will be full to its 7,988 capacity.

League Two Cambridge have big-match experience within the last 12 months, having twice won at Wembley - in the FA Trophy and a play-off final which secured a Football League return following a nine-year absence.

Money's men are unbeaten in 2015 and defeated Newport County 4-0 on Saturday in an impressive showing which he hopes will give fans a fillip.

'I hope they come to the game full of optimism,' Money said.

'I hope they come to the game with some belief that Friday can be the one in one hundred days that we can cause an upset.

'We want everyone to embrace the evening and an opportunity to showcase not just the football club, but the city.'

Cambridge and Manchester United have met twice before, in a two-legged League Cup tie in 1991.

Cambridge, who reached successive FA Cup quarter-finals in 1990 and 1991, drew the home leg, but had already lost 3-0 at Old Trafford.

As well as the Wembley successes, Cambridge have players who have experienced major highs; Luke Chadwick claimed a Premier League winners' medal at Manchester United and Michael Nelson was part of the Kilmarnock side which won the Scottish League Cup ahead of Celtic.

Money knows few teams in the world can live with Manchester United and players as talented as Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria, so will focus only on what his men can do.

'I don't think you can think too much about who the individuals are going to be, because they have a plethora of incredible talent, any of whom could play this Friday,' Money added.

'The only thing you can plan for is how you think they're going to play and that's what we'll be focusing on, and, in the main, focusing on what we can do.'

There is a financial benefit to the League Two side. Cambridge will earn £144,000 from the tie being televised.

The dream scenario would be a win, or a draw and a replay at Old Trafford which would bolster the coffers, but chief executive Jez George merely hopes the hosts can expand their fan-base by performing well.

George said: 'When you put it into the context of this club losing money consistently for the last 10 years, it's going to be a big help for us to move towards a little bit of financial stability and help us grow a little bit quicker than perhaps we would've done otherwise.

'We need to make sure we have crowds that are better between now and the end of the season, more season ticket holders next year and the journey the club's been on the last 18 months can be accelerated.'
