John Collins has challenged Ronny Deila’s critics to do their worst - insisting the new Celtic boss will cope with whatever stick comes his way.

The Norwegian is under pressure to dump Championship leaders Hearts out the League Cup at Parkhead after winning just five of his first 12 competitive games.

Three months into the job, the former Stromsgodset coach has still to establish a settled, winning starting 11.

John Collins believes Ronny Deila is capable of dealing with whatever comes his way

But No 2 Collins says Deila is equipped to deal with the demands of the job following an intense three-month induction period.

‘I’ve no doubt about that,’ said Collins. ‘That goes with the job, I’ve no doubt he can deal with that. You can slaughter him all you want.

‘I don’t think he’s changed, he’s just getting to know it and that takes time when you go into the new job. You’re constantly assessing staff, players, looking at opponents, and as you go along you learn.

‘That’s what he’s doing and I think he’s loving it.

‘He’s settled in 100 per cent and is very comfortable in the job now. He knows everything about what’s happening now, he knows the players inside out, the staff, getting a feel for the club.

‘That’s three months now and he’s nice and comfortable. He’s very intelligent, very motivated, he likes to win, hates to lose so that’s good assets to have.’

A Celtic player in the 1990s, Collins says the infrastructure and demands of the club have multiplied since his first spell there.

Deila has already confessed to being overwhelmed by the level of public attention, but Collins insisted: ‘He did his research. You can talk about it but until you’ve actually felt it and been around the place you don’t realise how big it is. Walking around the city now is not quite like walking around his home town in Norway.

‘That takes a bit of getting used to I’d imagine. Celtic fans are everywhere, want to speak to you, love you, so it’s a big part of the job.

‘There’s not many clubs like Celtic in the world and not many cities like Glasgow when it comes to football. But he’s thriving in it, getting used to it, loving it.

‘Celtic have moved up unbelievable amounts since the day I left. The training ground is state of the art, everything you could wish for as a coach, a player.

‘I think it’s a better job now - you’ve got everything at your disposal, haven’t you?’

Celtic have under-performed in the domestic cup competitions in recent seasons, and Deila has already vowed to do better in the League and Scottish Cups.

The League Cup remains a consistent source of failure for the club, an embarrassing home defeat to Morton last season illustrating the difficulties of motivating themselves for the competition.

Acknowledging the likelihood of a poor crowd this evening, however, Collins said there are no excuses for falling down in a competition he won as manager of Hibs.

‘I was at the Hearts game on Saturday and I was impressed with what I saw. They are playing good football, passing and moving, and they have good young players with a mixture of experience as well, so we know it will be a tough game.

‘They already know Hearts are a good team. I’ve reported back that they are good players, playing with confidence and are top of their league. They have what I’d call Premiership throughout their team.

‘But we want to win every trophy this season. That’s the target and the League Cup is the first one we can win.

‘I don’t think it will be difficult to motivate the players at all. They know how important every match is here.

‘Previously, we might have put weakened teams out in this cup but the manager has stated he wants to win every trophy domestically.

‘As coaches, we have to get the team fired up and when they get out on that pitch, they have to be very professional. I’ve no doubt they will be. They’ll be on their toes and ready to get a result. There won’t be a huge crowd but the players have to be switched on.

‘We are not giving excuses before the game. The bottom line is it is a big game and if we want to win the cup, we have to win these games.

‘We will show Hearts the respect they deserve and I’m sure they’ll be looking forward to the game as well. They’ll come to Celtic Park with nothing to lose.’

Meanwhile Charlie Mulgrew says he hopes to force his way back into Deila’s side sooner rather than later. The midfielder hasn’t featured since injuring his knee in the home defeat to Maribor a month ago but tweeted last night: ‘On my way back from London after having an injection on my knee. Looking forward to getting back training in the next couple of weeks.’
