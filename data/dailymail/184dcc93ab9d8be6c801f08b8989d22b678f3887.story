An eight-year-old boy suffering from an inoperable brain tumor has raised more than $40,000 so that he can bring smiles to other sick children by giving them toys.

Just a week ago, Matthew Jacko, who is home on hospice care in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, told his family he wanted to give a gift to every child at Children's Hospital, where he had previously stayed.

With the help of his family, he asked the public to help him raise money through a website to buy each a stuffed toy monkey, which cost $20 each - and the response was overwhelming.

Within 12 hours, they reached their goal of 500 monkeys and just days later, they had enough donations for 1,000 toys - and the amount still continues to grow.

The little boy has now hand-delivered some of the monkeys to the Children's Hospital and extra toys were sent to the Childrenâ€™s Institute, the Ronald McDonald House and Forbes pediatric unit.

On footage by WTAE, Matthew is pushed into the children's rooms on a wheelchair before handing over the monkeys and softly wishing them to feel better soon.

'I hope this makes you smile,' he can be heard telling the children.

He told the news station that he just wanted to bring smiles to other children as 'laughter is the best thing in the whole world'.

The visit came 18 months after Matthew's parents took him to Children's Hospital, noticing he wasn't running normally in basketball and had began to slur his speech.

Impressive: The family has received more than $40,000 in donations to help them buy the toy monkeys

Within 12 hours of his arrival, they learned that he had a brain tumor. They do not know how much longer they have with him - but continue to be inspired by his strength and compassion for others.

'He never complains, never questions, he just does whatever [the doctors] want him to do,' said his mother, Carey.

During the visit to the hospital this weekend, Matthew and his parents were joined by his sister Jocelyn, his uncle Patrick and friends including Lisa Donnelly, who had started the donation process.

All the friends and family members involved said they were stunned by the response.

'I don't know if it has completely sunk in yet either, the response has been overwhelming,' Carey said.

'Awesome': Matthew also met his favorite Pittsburgh Penguins player, Sidney Crosby, last week

Struggle: He was diagnosed after his parents noticed he was slurring. He is now at home for hospice care

'I would like to thank the community for all their efforts and everybody around the nation that has donated. I mean it's not just in Pittsburgh. This goes all around the country,' his dad, Brian, added.

Matthews parents, who have both taken time off work to care for their son, said the care does not just extend to the donations, but to the daily support they receive - such as cooked meals from friends.

It's not the only excitement little Matthew has enjoyed this week.

His hockey team, the Pittsburgh Penguins welcomed him to a game this week and he got a chance to meet Sidney Crosby, his favorite player.

He simply described the experience as 'awesome'.
