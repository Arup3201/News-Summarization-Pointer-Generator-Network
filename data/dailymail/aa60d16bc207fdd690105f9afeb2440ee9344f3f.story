It was often likened to a skip on wheels, yet somehow managed to become a symbol of the Soviet era.

But after more than 40 years on the road, Russia has finally decided to consign the much-ridiculed Lada to the scrapheap.

The box-like sedan - first produced in 1970 - became the most joked-about car in the world due to its shoddy construction and infamous unreliability.

End of the line: A 1970 version of the Lada, which is being ditched after its Russian makers announced it would no longer manufacture the ridiculed model

Once-popular: The Lada made a promising start thanks to strong exports, like this one in Cuba, which brought in much-needed funds to the then Soviet Union

Heading for the scrapheap: One of the later versions of the Lada Riva, a VAZ-2107, rolls through central Moscow yesterday as its manufacturers reveal it would be ceasing production of the model

'It's time to say good-bye,' said Igor Burenkov, spokesman for makers AvtoVAZ, who announced yesterday that it would halt manufacturing.

'The demand for "classical" models has fallen drastically.'

The Lada, known across the old USSR as the 'Zhiguli' and in the West as the 'Riva', has sold more than 20million worldwide and is still widely driven on Russian roads.

Although it broke down regularly, its legend rested on the knowledge of drivers all over the country to fix it and get it going again.

Pursuit vehicle: The Lada was the model of choice for some police forces

Off-roading: Lada's 4x4 Niva, first produced in 1955, which became popular in Canada

Critics say the latest version, the Lada 2107, was outdated the moment it first rolled off the assembly line three decades ago.

But unlike more sophisticated Western models, it seemed to cope better with the Siberian cold.

Chelsea tycoon Roman Abramovich was 
once a proud owner of a dark blue model and even asked his first wife 
Olga to change the gears for him - so he could feel what it was like to 
drive an automatic.

A man goes into a service-station and asks: 'Can I have a windscreen-wiper for my Lada?'

'Okay' replied the man in the garage. 'It seems a fair swap'. How do you double the value of a Lada?

First prize is a Lada. Second prize is two Ladas.

She 
said: 'Roman was so pleased with his Lada - and that he got one before 
his college friends. I crunched the gears. He was furious.

'He screamed "Stop it. You're doing everything wrong! You'll burn my clutch out."

'I was trying my best. I got out, slammed the door and screamed "Drive yourself!" and stormed off. He was like a typical Russian man.'

The name 'Lada' meant 'boat' in Old Russian and the badge depicts a Viking sailing ship.

The model made a promising start to life after being partly modelled on the 1966 Fiat 124 sedan.

It became a successul export due to its competitive price and DIY-friendly mechanics and brought in important funds for the cash-strapped Societ Union in the 1980s and 1990s.

The company even ventured into the realms of the roadster when it unveiled a concept car in 2003 and entered the World Touring Car Championships in 2008 and 2009.

Renault bought a 25 per cent share in AvtoVAZ in a $1billion deal in 2008, which was expected to result in new Lada models being produced,

But the car suffered a slump in popularity and the decision to sound the death knell came after a 76 per cent fall in sales in the first three months of this year.

The brand now produces more Western-looking cars and is embarking on a new alliance with Renault-Nissan.

Forward looking: A Lada-made electric concept car is revealed at the Russian International Auto Exhibition in 1999

Need for speed: Lada even ventured into the realms of the roadster with this concept car unveiled at the International Auto Show in Frankfurt, Germany, in 2003
