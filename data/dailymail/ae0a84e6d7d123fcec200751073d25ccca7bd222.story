Chelsea assistant first-team coach Jose Morais has taken a one-year sabbatical in order to become the manager of Saudi Arabian side Al-Shabbab.

Morais first joined Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan where he assisted in scouting and opposition analysis before following the now Chelsea boss to Real Madrid.

The Blues have revealed that Morais's role as assistant first-team coach will be split between two different members of staff.

Head of analysis and opposition scouting James Melbourne will take over and report directly to Mourinho as he works closely with scouts Mick McGiven and Paul McGiven.

Former Real Madrid staff member Carlos Lalin has also joined Mourinho's backroom from Real Madrid.

Lalin will become the assistant first-team fitness coach and gym manager.
