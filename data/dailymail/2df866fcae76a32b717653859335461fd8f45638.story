Police have arrested five people from California after an 18-year-old girl was allegedly kidnapped and forced into prostitution.

The teenager claimed she was taken at gunpoint while she was walking in Compton on Thursday afternoon, police said.

Police said she was then taken to an undisclosed location and sexually assaulted by two of the abductors before the gang took her to a motel in Moreno Valley, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles.

Accused: Four men and one woman have been arrested in connected with an alleged kidnapping and forced prostitution of an 18-year-old girl. They include Ana Ceja (L), 20, from San Jose and Abubakr Horrington (R), 32, from Gilroy

According to Contra Costa Times, the kidnappers told her she would be forced into prostitution at the hotel.

Police were alerted to the alleged crime on Friday afternoon when they received a call from the hotel.

Officers said the teenager had bolted from the room when the suspects were distracted and told the woman on the desk what had happened.

Khalid Binhajjyahyaabdulmalik (L), 23, from Gilroy, and Ibrahim Binhajjyahyaabdulmalik (R), 25, from San Jose, are in custody in connection with the alleged kidnapping, sexual assault and forced prostitution charges

Speaking to the Contra Costa Times, 
Carolyn Lin, general manager of the Best Western motel, said the 
teenager walked up and quietly told her she had been kidnapped.

Police received the call at 5pm and 
officers raided the motel room and stopped a Mercedes-Benz as it was 
leaving. They arrested everyone inside, the news service said.

Jerry Landers, 21, from Gilroy, is also at Riverside County jail in connection with the charges

Officers also recovered a handgun, the news service said.

The victim gave evidence to the police and was examined as a matter of course in hospital.

Sheriff's Department Sgt Sawyer told the paper: 'She was frightened but unharmed.'

Four men and a woman are being held in Riverside jail on suspicion of crimes including human trafficking, abduction for prostitution, false imprisonment, kidnapping for sexual assault, and attempted pimping and pandering, Contra Costa Times said.

They are: San Jose residents Ibrahim Binhajjyahyaabdulmalik, 25, and Ana Ceja, 20; and Gilroy residents Khalid Binhajjyahyaabdulmalik, 23, Abubakr Horrington, 32, and Jerry Landers, 21.

Riverside County Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force has taken on the investigation.

Recent figures from the FBI revealed that California has the worst rates of sex slavery in the US.

In the last year or so, trends have shown that victims have shifted from foreigners to American citizens, not only in big cities but also in suburbs and across the state, an NBC report earlier this year said.
