Melissa Reid wrote a moving letter from behind bars on her birthday to her family telling them to ‘pray for me’.

Melissa, who turned 20 in a police cell, wrote the letter to her mother Debra, brother Liam, 22, and twin sisters Stephanie and Jennifer, 18, in Scotland.

In a remarkably upbeat tone, she wrote: ‘This is one birthday that I will be forgetting ASAP! I know that you are doing all that you can but its [sic] frustrating and hard for me when you are dealing with police like this and after 9 days they are just getting round to interrogating us!’

Up beat: Melissa's letter is she remarkably upbeat has she tells her mother and siblings about being interrogated by police and how this is one birthday 'I will be forgetting ASAP'

The two-sided letter, written on crumpled A4 paper, reveals Melissa’s struggle with life behind bars.

She wrote: ‘Everything here is so corrupt like you said it’s all about money, especially in jail!!! I have heard stories but I need to keep strong because it could only be word of mouth!’

Of her fellow captive, she wrote: ‘I have made a sister for life in Michaella. I say sister because our bond is just beginning and no matter what we go through it will never be broken.’

But the reality of her situation was clearly hitting home.

‘I found it hard in here at first. I  was crying in here a lot and could not handle the language barrier, it was really frustrating!

'Sisters for life': Melissa wrote of her closeness with her co-defendant saying: 'No matter what we go through our bond will never be broken'

‘But that just gave them more power over me as allowed them [sic] to just send me down stairs to the cells, tell me to calm down or else I would not be allowed back up,’ she wrote. ‘I am s******g my pants for what has to come for me.’

She finished with the emotional message: ‘Love you all so much. Pray for me please and stay strong.’

It comes as the saga of the 'Peru Two' approaches the three week mark.

Since then their frightened faces have become familiar across the globe - and their case has divided opinion.

Accused of trafficking drugs out of Peru, the two women, both 20, face sentences of up to 15 years.

In the meantime they are already experiencing the harsh realities of a Peruvian prison, awaiting trial.
