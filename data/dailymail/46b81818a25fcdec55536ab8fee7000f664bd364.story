Martin Murray insists he does not fear Gennady Golovkin's power as both men made weight for their world title fight in Monte Carlo.

The middleweights clash at the plush Salle des Etoile on Saturday night with Golovkin's WBA belt on the line. 

The Kazakhstan punching machine has stopped his last 18 opponents and has a knockout percentage of 90.32 per cent.

Murray insists Golovkin's power holds no fear for him despite his fearsome knockout percentage

Martin Murray: 159.9lb

Gennady Golovkin: 158.9lb 

(Weight limit: 160lb) 

But Murray is relishing the chance to test himself against the best in the division as hundreds of his fans from St Helens roared their man on during the weigh-in.

'His power is obviously something you have to look out for,' he said. 'He clearly hits hard. His general ring craft is very good as well. He's very good at putting you in places he wants to put you. 

'It doesn't bother me that Golovkin hits hard. Don't get me wrong, I'd prefer it if he hit a bit softer, but it doesn't faze me knowing that I'm going to go in there with someone who knocks everybody out. 

'I know he hits hard, I know it's going to be a tough fight and I know I might get hurt. I'm ready and prepared for it, though.'

Golovkin has stopped each of his last 18 opponents, most recently Marco Antonio Rubio last October

Golovkin needed less than two rounds to despatch Rubio during a sell-out event in Los Angeles
