A woman who has been accused alongside her husband of brutally stabbing her ex-boss and his wife in revenge after being fired from her job is now claiming it was all her husband's idea, and she did not even realize what was happening. 

Alecia Schmuhl said at a bail hearing that she had no idea her husband planned on stabbing Leo Fisher and his wife Susan in their swank suburban home in McLean, Virginia on Sunday, adding that she was in the car the entire time and forced to participate in transporting her husband. 

It has now been revealed that Andrew actually shot at Mrs Fisher and put Mr Fisher in cuffs, torturing him until he was sent fleeing when Susan activated the couple's alarm.

Accessory: Alecia (above) is also claiming she just drove the car, and was not inside while her husband was torturing the couple

Andrew was found shortly after, covered in blood and wearing nothing but a diaper, with his clothes and the weapon in the trunk of his car.

ABC News reports that a judge refused to consider bond for Alecia, stating that she posed an 'extreme danger' to the community. 

He added that there would be a whole lot more information about this case coming in the weeks ahead. 

Andrew knocked on the door of the $1 million home on Sunday and gained entry claiming he was a law enforcement officer. 

He then Tasered Mr Fisher and shot at his wife, before putting him in cuffs and stabbing and torturing him.

Eventually, Mrs Fisher was able to set off an alarm, which sent Andrew running.

Caught: Cops located Alecia and Andrew an hour later, and noted Andrew was covered in blood and wearing just a diaper in their car, with his clothes and the weapon in the trunck

Scene: It all happened at the Fisher's swank suburban home in McLean, Virginia

Emergency responders who arrived at the home on the 900 block of Spencer Rd found the Fishers suffering from stab wounds to their upper body, and the couple was rushed to Inova Fairfax Hospital. 

Victim: Leo Fisher, Alecia's ex-boss, was stabbed and tortured by Andrew

They are still hospitalized, and Mr Fisher is unable to speak, communicating with officers using notes. 

It is believed that Alecia then drove the two away, and an hour later police found them in their car near Interstate 95.

They have both been charged with two counts each of abduction and malicious wounding in connection with the attack, and are being held without bail.   

Now, police are trying to figure out what motivated this young couple to commit such a heinous crime.

Even former coworkers and friends of the two seem completely baffled. 

'It’s a horrendously sad situation,' Merrit Green, a lawyer who worked with Alecia at a previous job, told The Washington Post.

'She was on a good, bright career path, and so was her husband. It’s just unbelievable.' 

Alecia, 30, spoke three languages and served on the board of a local homeless charity.

A fellow board member said he was 'completely shocked' by the arrest. 

The couple met when they attended Indiana’s Valparaiso University Law School, and Andrew, 31, had held various legal positions over the past few years, though it seemed he was currently unemployed according to his Linked In page. 

They are set to make their first court appearance on January 6.
