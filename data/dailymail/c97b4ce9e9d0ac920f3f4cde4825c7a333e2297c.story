Dozens of Calgary police are searching a sprawling farm outside the Canadian city after a tip in the disappearance of a young boy and his grandparents led them to the property.

Authorities released a CCTV image of a pickup they believe is 
linked to the disappearance of five-year-old Nathan O'Brien and Alvin and Kathryn Liknes, and locals had them at the truck owner's home in less than 24 hours.

The late 1980s
 - early 1990s green Ford F-150 was seen in the Park Hill area the trio was in around the time they 
are believed to have gone missing, police said. A man has been taken in for questioning, but has not been identified because he has yet to be charged with a crime.

No stone unturned: Officers are walking every inch of every field on the farm after tips led them to the property

Searching buildings: Police in what resembled Haz-Mat suits also looked through buildings on the property

massive effort: Dozens of police officers shuttled up from Calgary to the rural plot of land to look for the missing five-year-old boy and his grandparents

The property owners are an elderly couple who have lived there for decades and have an adult son in his 50s who lives at home and mostly keeps to himself, neighbors told Global News.

A man has been taken in for questioning but has not yet been charged with any wrongdoing, Calgary Police Service Duty Inspector Jow Matthews said during a Saturday press conference.

Gone: Five-year-old Nathan O'Brien went missing from his grandparents house sometime Sunday night or Monday morning

'Police were led to the property yesterday evening following a tip after the public appeal for information relating to the truck,' said Matthews.

'It’s simply a lead that we’re following up… that we believe has some weight.'

'We’re questioning the man and following the lead on the vehicle,' Matthews continued. 'He is a person of interest.'

Aerial footage from Global News showed teams of officers walking every inch of the fields on the property and planting orange flags near areas of interest.

Officers in what resembled Haz-Mat suits were also seen searching buildings on the massive property.

Two other searchers could be seen emptying grain from a large truck one bucket at a time.

Police appear to be leaving no stone unturned in their search of the farm.

'They were quite hush hush,' neighbor Jimmy Nevada told Global News. 'The SWAT team was out checking buildings and what not.'

Police vehicles lined the street in front of the farm and dotted the plot of land it sits on.

'We want to make sure that we cover every avenue, we want to cover off that ground as quickly as we can,' Matthews said, adding that he expects searchers to be there for a total of 24 to 36 hours.

The massive search effort came only 
one day after a still of the pickup truck was released to the public in a
 nationally televised press conference.

Not suspects: Alvin and Kathryn Liknes are not 
considered suspects in the case, since investigators found signs of a 
struggle in the home

'We just believe given 
the area the vehicle was in, and the fact that it was the night of the 
incident and that it drove in the area several times, that there's a 
good possibility that the individual, or individuals, may have 
information,' Calgary police Staff Sgt. Doug Andrus said at a Friday 
news briefing.

Police also were able to confirm the worst news of all.

'A violent crime happened in that residence,' Andrus said, according to the CBC.

Despite
 this declaration, Andrus added 'we remain hopeful that we will find 
them alive, but, based on the evidence, I would say someone would be in 
medical distress.

Calgary
 Police and the young boy's parents have also now begun asking anyone 
who attended an estate sale last weekend to provide fingerprints, said 
Andrus. Those are being run against evidence already collected.

Parents
 of a missing Canadian boy issued an emotional plea to bring him home 
yesterday, after he disappeared earlier this week from a sleepover at 
his grandparents house.

Tipped off: Police swarmed the farm after neighbors told them the green Ford F-150 was parked in the driveway

Sprawling: Police are on the massive farm in hopes of finding anything that will lead them to five-year-old Nathaniel O'Brien and his grandparents Alvin and Kathryn Liknes - they have been missing for one week

Closed off: Police vehicles lined the street in front of the property and locals were told to stay away

Have you seen this truck: Canadian authorities are searching for this green late 1980s - early 1990s Ford F-150 pickup, they believe the driver may have information that would lead to the missing trio

The
 grandparents are not considered suspects in the case as investigators 
found evidence that all three left the home against their will.

At the Wednesday press conference, Nathan's father Rod O'Brien cried as he spoke about his beloved middle son.

'To
 whoever has Nathan, please find it in your heart to drop off our little
 angel Nathan, so he can be rescued and reunited with his brothers and 
his family,' Mr O'Brien said.

Jennifer O'Brien also spoke, telling her son to have courage.

'Stay strong, Nathan. We know you are our superhero and I just need you to stay strong and we are going to see you.'

'We
 can't be with you right now, but the best people who can be with you 
other than us are your grandparents,' Mrs O'Brien said of her parents. 
'I know Grandma is holding you so tight right now, and they are doing 
everything in their power to keep you safe.'

Mrs
 O'Brien last saw her son Sunday night, after helping her parents all 
day with a garage sale as they were downsizing to move into a new 
Edmonton home.

She left her parents home around 10pm and Nathan stayed behind to have a sleepover with his grandparents.

When she returned 12 hours later in the morning, all three were gone.

An Amber Alert was issued for Nathan later that evening, but investigators so far have not named a suspect.

Investigators
 have not said much about what they found in the home, but there is 
visible an 8-meter-long drag mark of what looks to be recently cleaned 
up dark liquid that runs from the home's side door to the driveway.

'We have a big mystery on our hands right now, we don’t know where these people are,' said Inspector Keith Cain.

'We’re still very optimistic they are alive.'

Where did they go? Mom Jennifer O'Brien was the last to see Nathan after she left him at her parents house Sunday night

Mrs O'Brien and her son spent the day prior helping her parents with a garage sale at their home

Investigators
 are now asking those who attended the garage sale on Sunday to attend a
 meeting at the Parkhill Community Hall today. Officers want the 
shoppers to bring with them their purchases so they can figure out what 
was or wasn't taken from the home. The meeting is running from 10am to 
10pm.

Before Wednesday's plea for help, the family considered announcing a 
reward but decided against it since police said it might not be helpful 
right now.

Authorities
 say there was no custody issues with the family since Nathan is the 
O'Brien's biological son and they are still married. 

Nathan
 is described as three-feet tall with curly blond hair and brown eyes. 
He was last seen wearing peach-colored shorts and a blue-striped hoodie.

Alvin
 Liknes is six-feet tall, 200 pounds with grey and blond hair and was 
wearing black shorts. Authorities say he has a distinctive walk. His 
wife Kathryn is five-foot-three, 120 pounds and has reddish-brown hair 
with green eyes.

Since the three family members were reported missing, authorities have received over 100 tips.
