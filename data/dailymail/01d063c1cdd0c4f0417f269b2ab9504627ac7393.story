Adam Downworth, 32, of Stockport, was given 10 life sentences after being convicted of a string of rape and sexual assault charges

An office cleaner who hunted down and attacked young women walking home alone at night was given ten life sentences today.

Serial rapist Adam Downworth, 32, cruised the streets in his Citroen Berlingo so he could deliberately spot and ambush lone victims who had been drinking with friends.

After selecting his target, Downworth would park his van before stalking and creeping up on the women on secluded roads and public parks.

He incapacitated them using throttling manoeuvres he learnt from his martial arts books before subjecting the victims to sadistic sexual attacks as they came round and pleading for mercy.

One woman who begged Downworth to take her purse and mobile phone was told: 'Look at my eyes.

'It’s all about teaching little bitches like you that they can’t walk on the street on their own when there’s men like me about.

'It’s not about the money. If it was about money, I’d have took it by now.'

Another victim suffered several facial fractures after being kicked about the head and raped twice.

She feared she would die during a 30-minute ordeal as Downworth told her: 'You’re all dirty b******. No-one will look at you again.'

Downworth claimed five victims during his 10-month reign of terror across Stockport and Manchester before being captured in September last year.

Whilst he was on the loose, drunken and vulnerable women found walking alone at night were stopped and given lifts home by police in patrol cars to avoid them becoming his next victims.

During a raid officers found a library of martial arts books at the home of Downworth’s mother including Secrets of the Ninja, The Invisible Ninja: Ancient Secrets of Surprise, and Knights of Darkness.

Chapters on choking and strangling and how to stage surprise attacks were highlighted in pencil.

One passage told how a combatant in a martial contest could be incapacitated in just three seconds.

It emerged Downworth was also a Facebook troll who used a victim’s mobile phone to scour the social media site for other women so he could send them filthy messages.

One read: 'Dya really fink ur so atraktive, ha. U dres like a s*** so just luk cheap like a hooker u don’t pay.'

Today there were shouts from the public gallery at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, of: 'Rot in hell' and 'I hope you die a slow death' as Downworth, of Brinnington, was ordered to serve a minimum of 23 years in jail.

He was convicted of 13 charges including rape, attempted rape, assault by penetration and assault occasioning actual and grievous bodily harm.

Police fear there may have been other victims who were too frightened to come forward.

The court heard how victims suffered serious injuries and long-lasting psychological harm as a result of the attacks, in which Downworth would wear blue surgical gloves from his workplace to avoid his fingerprints being found at the scene of his crimes.

Alaric Bassano, prosecuting said: 'On each of the occasions he cruised the streets in his works van seeking out vulnerable lone females in secluded locations.

'Once he had identified victims, he discreetly parked his van and pursued them on foot, either attacking them from behind or lying in wait until they crossed his path.

'A striking feature of these attacks is the use of gratuitous violence against his victims, violence beyond that necessity to fulfil his sexual purpose and seemingly unleashed simply to increase the suffering of the women.

Alexandra Park in Stockport was one of the locations of his attacks - he also attacked women in Manchester

Terrifying: Downworth would stalk his victims in his van at night before parking and creeping up to throttle them

'He spoke in hateful and degrading ways whilst attacking them and appeared to be deriving sadistic pleasure from their suffering.'

The first victim, 28, who had been drinking with a friend was attacked at 2.50am on December 3 2011 as she crossed bridge over a reservoir at Alexandra Park in Edgeley, near Stockport.

She was attacked from behind and grabbed in a headlock before being told: 'Don’t move or I’ll stab you - you know what’s going to happen to you - don’t you.'

He then choked the woman until she lost consciousness before sexually assaulting her as she lay helpless on the floor - then beating her about the face.

A second woman, 26, was grabbed the following April as she walked home from a takeaway but he fled with her handbag when she screamed for her partner.

In May 2012, the third victim, 22, was attacked as she walked home at 1am after socialising with friends. She said she was attacked by two men with Downworth ripping off her clothes and telling her:'I’m not going to hury you. If you s*** me off it will be all over.'

A fourth victim, 28, was attacked in the early hours of 1 July 2012 as she walked home through Debdale Park in Gorton after a drinking session with friends.

The final known victim, 48, was raped at 1am on September 16 after she left a bar in Stockport.

'So many times I've blamed myself and wondered why it was me.'

He attacked her from behind before dragging her by the hair and then ankles down a secluded footpath before raping her twice adding: 'I’ll have to kill you now.'

The woman managed to break free and ran to horrified passersby. Downworth was spotted fleeing the area and police arrested him close to his van.

He was linked to the previous attacks by CCTV footage of his van, petrol receipts and tracking of his mobile phones. Two mobile phones stolen from victims were also later found at his home.

One victim said later: 'On the night of the attack my life was turned upside down and I have never been the same since. So many times I’ve blamed myself and wondered why it was me. When I went back to work I kept bursting into tears so I had to give up my job.

'Some of my hair even began to fall out with all the stress. It got to the point where I tried to kill myself.'

  'You are to be regarded as dangerous and...there is a serious risk of harm to members of the public.'

    - Judge Jeffrey Lewis

Downworth claimed he was a street mugger who had not sexually assaulted any victims, and invented a fictitious accomplice who he blamed for the more serious sexual attacks.

But Judge Jeffrey Lewis told him: 'You are to be regarded as dangerous and it is as clear to me as it possibly could be that there is a serious risk of harm to members of the public.

'Even your own counsel conceded that these women were attacked and degraded in a horrible way.'

After the case Detective Inspector Rebecca Matthews said: 'Downworth subject these women to some of the most appalling attacks I have seen in my policing career.

'The library of books at his home gave a chilling insight into his personality and thought processes, ranging from research on law surrounding sexual offences to hiding your true personality from others.

'Due to the serious nature of his offending, it is possible there may be other victims that have not come forward to police for whatever reason. If this is the case, I would urge them to do so.'

She added: 'When we arrested Downworth, we found a library of books at his home that gave a chilling insight into his personality and thought processes, ranging from research on law surrounding sexual offences to hiding your true personality from others.'
