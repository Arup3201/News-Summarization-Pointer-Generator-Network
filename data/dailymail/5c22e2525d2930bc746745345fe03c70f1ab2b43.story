These revealing images offer a glimpse at the full spectrum of life in reclusive North Korea, after leader Kim Jong-Un declared it to be a country on the brink of 'radical' change.

The photographs capture a country of stark contrasts, with pictures ranging from fireworks exploding in the skies above Pyongyang during lavish New Year's Eve celebrations, to impoverished children hauling mounds of hay on their back at a farm in South Hwanghae province.

The pictures - which were all taken by state photographers or western photographers under government supervision - also include shots taken on the day North Korea made headlines across the globe with the launch of its Unha-3 rocket in December.

In one 29-year-old leader Kim Jong-Un - who vowed to build the country into an economic 'giant' in a New Year's Day speech - is seen puffing on a cigarette at the country's General Satellite and Control Command Center following the launch of the rocket.

North Korea has insisted the launch was carried out in order to put a satellite into space, but the move drew condemnation from many corners of the international community, with Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague among those to brand the rocket launch as 'provocative'.

The young leader went on to hail the successful launch in a surprise New Year's Day address on state television, during which he outlined plans to boost the impoverished nation's economy through science and technology.

It has also been said that Kim Jong-Un is planning to allow the country's farmers to keep a larger share of their produce in a bid to boost the country's agricultural output, by giving poverty-stricken farmers an incentive to grow more food.

Under existing rules farmers are required to turn over everything to the state beyond what they are allowed to keep to feed their families.

The 29-year-old also pledged to boost North Korea's military power, an ambition that is evident in displays of might such as the mass rally held on the streets of the capital in the wake of the December rocket launch.
