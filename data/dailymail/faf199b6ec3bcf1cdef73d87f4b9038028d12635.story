A policewoman really is the (very) strong arm of the law having just taken second place in a world bodybuilding championship.

PC Kinga Szweda, 29, from Tucholska, a district in the city of Bydgoszcz in central Poland, came runner-up to Sweden's Maria Hasselmark in the Women's Bodyfitness event in Canada.

And Kinga, who only started bodybuilding two years ago, says she is delighted with her achievement.

Police spokesman: 'I don't think too many crooks will want to be messing around when she's on patrol' 

She said: 'I dreamed of getting in the top six, so to be second is just amazing.

'It was really tough preparing for it, getting over the flu, and then the dehydration and fatigue of the journey.

'But I was pleased I did so well.'

The secret she says is down to her gym instructor boyfriend.

Kinga said: 'He put me through some very intensive training and I went on a very strict diet, although I do still love chocolate.

'But my achievement just shows that if you have a goal then you have to do everything to achieve it, despite the obstacles that are sure to get in the way

'I just went for it and it was worth it.'

Now colleagues are thrilled to bits and have swamped her with praise.

A police spokesman said: 'We are all enormously proud of Kinga's success - and it's going to give some of the tough lads around here something to think about too.

'I don't think too many crooks will want to be messing around when she's on patrol.'
