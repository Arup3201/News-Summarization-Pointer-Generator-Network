Singer Ricki-Lee Coulter has revealed how her difficult early childhood is behind her decision not to have children with fiance Richard Harrison.

Speaking to radio hosts Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald and Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli on Nova FM on Wednesday, the performer said being 'dumped' with relatives while her mother, Loretta Sheerin, went out meant she was left looking after younger members of the family instead.

'I'm the eldest of like 30 grandchildren, my mum is one of like, fifty thousand kids. I was the eldest of all these grandkids and I was the one looking after them,' revealed the 28-year-old.

'My mum had me when she was really young and so I was dumped with whoever aunty or friend or cousin who would take me while she went out partying, being an 18-year-old.'

The singer's parents separated early and Ricki-Lee was initially raised solely by her mother when the pair moved from New Zealand to the Gold Coast, leaving her father in New Zealand.

Loretta, who is of Maori descent, worked hard to make ends meet, juggling two jobs.

Eventually Loretta married her Scottish husband John, and had two more children - Jodie, now 25, and two-year-old Emily.

The dedicated mother enjoys a close relationship with her famous daughter - Ricki Lee recently posting an image of the pair of them together on Instagram - while the siblings are also tight-knit.

Now, performer Ricki-Lee says her strong feelings about remaining childless may have led in part to the breakdown of her own first marriage, to Gold Coast builder Jamie Babbington in 2007.

The union only lasted just over one year.

'The hard thing was I got married, stupidly, when I was 21 and he really wanted them [kids],' she revealed.

'And I felt that pressure of him wanting to have kids, and that maybe I was going to change how I felt about it and the things that I wanted to in with my life, to make him happy.

'My ex wanted like seven kids, and I was like, 'Come on girlfriend. Not a chance. Have a great time finding someone to have seven kids with you!'

The revelations were sparked when the radio hosts challenged Ricki-Lee to completes a sentence as as if it was part of her wedding speech.

After the hosts said, 'Today is a memory that I will cherish for the rest of my life so thank you for being here, the reason that I have such faith in my future marriage to Rich is that we both have...'

Ricki-Lee responded: 'We both don't want kids,' later explaining: 'I don't know whether it's my experience as a kid, but I know how crazy my life is and how all over the place it is,and you have to be selfish to do what I do.

'I have so much respect for people who actually do do it but I wouldn't want to put a kid through what I went through.'
