A group of fighters with links to al-Qaeda joined the ranks of Syrian rebels as they seized a government missile defense base near the northern city of Aleppo.

Activists report that battles began around 9pm last night and continued until early this morning.

This heightens fears that extremist jihad soldiers are are taking advantage of the chaos among the rebels to acquire advanced weapons.

Videos posted online Friday said to have been shot inside the base said the extremist group, Jabhat al-Nusra, participated in the overnight battle for the air defence base near the village of al-Taaneh, east of Aleppo in northern Syria.

The videos show dozens of fighters inside the base near a radar tower, along with rows of large missiles, some on the backs of trucks.

A report by a correspondent with the Arabic satellite network Al-Jazeera who visited the base Friday said Jabhat al-Nusra had seized the base. The report showed a number of missiles and charred buildings, as fighters covered their faces with black cloths.

Two Aleppo-based activists and Rami Abdul-Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, also said Jabhat al-Nusra fought in the battle.

Abu Firas, spokesman for the 
Revolutionary Council in Aleppo, told the Guardian that a few hundred 
fighters from Jabhat al-Nusra, Fajr al-Islam and a few members of the 
FSA took part in the the overtake which has seen the base completely 
destroyed.

Mr Firas said that since this morning government air raid have destroyed ‘most of the rockets and radars inside'.

He said more than 10 Syrian soldiers were captured and many killed, alongside four rebel soldiers.

The rebels have set up checkpoints around the base and were able to confiscate 20 different rockets.

One Aleppo activist said despite the government raids the rebels 
had taken all the munitions they could from the newly captured base, and
he hoped they could find a way to use the missiles against Assad's air 
force.

'We have asked all 
countries to help us with anti-aircraft weapons and no one has, so 
hopefully these will help,' said the activist, Mohammed Saeed.

Little
is known about Jabhat al-Nusra, or the Support Front, which began 
claiming attacks in Syria earlier this year in postings on jihadi forums
often used by al-Qaeda.

While
neither group has officially acknowledged the other, analysts say 
al-Nusra's tactics, jihadist rhetoric and use of al-Qaida forums point 
to an affiliation.

Western powers worry that Islamist extremists are playing an increasing role in Syria's civil war, which started in March 2011 as a mostly peaceful uprising against President Bashar Assad.

Activist say more than 32,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

Despite their opposition to the Assad regime, the U.S. and others have cited the presence of extremists among the rebels as a reason not to supply them with weapons. Rebel leaders argue that the lack of military aid leaves a vacuum that extremists can exploit.

The base captured Friday is part of the large air defense infrastructure Syria has built across the country over the years, mostly for use in a possible war with archenemy Israel.

Last week, the rebels reported seizing another air defense base outside the capital, Damascus, as well as a base in the southern province of Daraa. Online videos shows them torching vehicles and seizing boxes of ammunition in the Daraa base.

The storming of such bases by rebels from inside Syria embarrasses the Assad regime, though it is unclear if the rebels have the know-how to deploy these bases' weapons.

Nor is it clear if the rebels are holding the bases after storming them.

Meanwhile, President Assad has received support from Lebanese politican Michel Aoun.

The ex-general and Maronite politician said: ‘Syria will achieve victory over the conspiracy and will turn into a democratic state that will be a model for the rest of the countries currently fighting it,’ he told government news agency, Sana.

Interviewed by Syrian television, Mr Aoun said President Assad will put an end to the radical extremist surge in the region and its win of the war would result in a new world order as the U.S. unilateralism is no longer acceptable.

He added that he believes that, unlike other Arab countries which saw their governments toppled during the Arab Spring Syria is heading towards democracy and despite losses, both human and economic, the administration in Syria has remained strong.

Intercepted: The Syrian passenger plane that was forced by Turkish jets to land in Ankara on Wednesday

The interception of a passenger plane allegedly carrying military gear from Moscow to Damascus is a sign of Turkey's mounting frustration at the drawn-out conflict and its inability to hasten regime change in Syria, according to analysts.

Recent cross-border shelling from Syria that killed five Turkish civilians near the countries' 566-mile common frontier may have forced Turkey to act, but its options were limited.

‘There's nothing magical about the timing. It's a coincidence resulting from the build-up of frustration in Ankara,’ said Fadi Hakura, a Turkey analyst at the Chatham House think tank in London.

‘Turkey wants to hasten the demise of the Assad regime in Damascus, but really its hands are tied.’

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been at the forefront of international efforts to put pressure on the Assad regime and end its 19-month crackdown on the opposition. Last year, Ankara began allowing members of the rebel Free Syrian Army to operate in Turkey and now Syria's civil war has reached a stalemate.

‘Given the current international impasse over the conflict in Syria, practical measures such as the interception of aircraft will become increasingly important for states seeking to restrict Syrian government forces' access to military-related goods from external sources,’ said Edin Omanovic, a researcher with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Turkish fighter jets on Wednesday intercepted the Syrian Air plane they said was carrying Russian ammunition and military equipment destined for the Syrian Defense Ministry. Syria branded the incident piracy and Russia said the action endangered the lives of Russian citizens aboard the aircraft.

Russia has been one of Syria's main weapons suppliers, and it has also been shielding the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad from U.N. sanctions.

Mehmet Yegin, an analyst with the Ankara-based International Strategic Research Organization, said that it was not yet clear whether the decision to force down the Moscow to Damascus plane was part of a larger drive to change the dynamic of the war.

‘If it is acting with its allies, it's a clear message to Russia to get out of the picture and stop arming Syria,’ he added. ‘It is such a bold move, that one wonders if Turkey acted alone.’

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland declined Thursday to comment on Turkish media reports that the intelligence on the plane's contents had come from the United States.

But she told reporters that Washington backed Turkey's decision to intercept the plane.

‘Any transfer of any military equipment to the Syrian regime at this time is very concerning, and we look forward to hearing more from the Turkish side when they get to the bottom of what they found,’ said Nuland.

The exact contents of the cargo are still unclear: Turkey's prime minister described it as ‘ammunition,’ while Yeni Safak, a newspaper close to the Turkish government, reported Friday that the cargo contained 12 pieces of missile parts and ‘trigger devices’ and that intelligence received was that it could be used by Syria against Turkey.

The respected Russian daily Kommersant quoted an unidentified source as saying there were 12 boxes of spare parts for radars of the Syrian missile defense units.

‘If the Kommersant report is right, you could speculate about this being part of a build-up to imposing a no-fly zone,’ said Hugh Pope, who leads the Turkey program for the International Crisis Group.

Such a move could be the first step toward lending Syria's rebels the same kind of international air support that helped bring down Libya's Muammar Gadhafi last year.

But most analysts see no push — either in Turkey or among its Western allies — for outside military involvement in Syria.
