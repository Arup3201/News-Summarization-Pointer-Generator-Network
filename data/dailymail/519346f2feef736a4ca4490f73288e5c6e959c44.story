Paul Ryan's so-called 'energy and vision' has helped him become Mitt Romney's new vice-presidential running mate.

And it seems that the 42-year-old who will join the presumptive Republican nominee in the 2012 White House race gets his fighting spirit from P90X, an extreme fitness regime he is devoted to.

Mr Ryan, a father-of-three from Janesville, Wisconsin, has just six to eight per cent body fat thanks to the workout, which aims to confuse muscles by blending exercise, yoga and martial arts moves.

The six-foot-two politician was inspired to stay fit and healthy after finding his father dead in his bed in 1986 when Paul was just 16. The 55-year-old had suffered from a fatal heart attack.

The chairman of the House Budget Committee, who was announced as Mr Romney's running man just two days ago, is a former personal trainer who now weighs around 163lbs.

The regime, which involves learning fitness moves from a video series, is broken down into a range of cardio activities, pull-ups, push-ups, karate and yoga.

'I'm kind of a skinny guy', he toldÂ Politico.com in March before revealing that he leads P90X workouts along with fellow politician Bart Stupak every morning on Capitol Hill.

He added: 'There's about a dozen of us who do it... It's a fantastic workout.'

Hard-core: The workout, seen above, was created by Tony Horton, an exercise instructor from Rhode Island

Extreme: Mr Ryan is a big fan of the regime and is said to lead a workout every morning at Capitol Hill

House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy is also said to take part in the daily workout which begins at 6am.

Sounding like a true convert, Mr Ryan, who detailed that he drinks two cups of coffee every morning in addition to working out, said: 'It pushes your body in many different ways so that it gets out of its plateau. It has results. It works.'

Founded by Tony Horton, an exercise instructor from Rhode Island, P90X is a home exercise system that aims to transform a person's body in just 90 days.

Muscles confusion is said to prevent a person from adapting to exercise, which results in continuous fitness improvement.

As the workout changes from day to day, he added that it offers a unique take on regular fitness routines.

Mr Ryan wears a heart-rate monitor when he works out and aims to hit a target heart rate of 165 beats per minute.

The
 youngest of four children, Mr Ryan has also described the heartbreaking
 moment when he discovered his father in bed 
after he was struck by the heart attack.

'It was just a big punch to the gut,' he told The New Yorker magazine. 'I concluded I've for to either sink or swim in life.'

The trauma of such a discovery had a severe impact on their entire family.

Mr Ryan's mother, Elizabeth, was forced to go back to college to study interior design in order to support her children.

His grandmother moved back into the family home in order to care for Mr Ryan and his siblings while their mother attended college.

The politician now loves staying 
active as much as he can and also enjoys deer hunting and skiiing, 
revealing to CNN that at one stage of his life, he was forced to ditch a
 chance to forge a professional career in skiing in order to pursue 
politics.

He even admitted that he 'sometimes' regrets the decision.

More than three million copies of P90X have been sold since the program was created in 2004, raking in an estimated $420million.

Along with DVD videos, the program comes with a nutrition guide, fitness plan and calendar.

Mr Romney described Mr Ryan as man of integrity and character rooted in his middle-class Midwest upbringing as well as an intellectual leader at a time when the United States was in fiscal crisis.

'Paul is a man of tremendous character, 
shaped in large part by his early life,' he said. 'Paul's father died 
when he was in high school. That forced him to grow up earlier than any 
young man should.

'But Paul did, with the help of his devoted mother, his brothers and 
sister, and a supportive community. And as he did, he internalized the 
virtues and hard-working ethic of the Midwest.

'Paul Ryan works in Washington - but his beliefs remain firmly rooted in
Janesville, Wisconsin. He is a person of great steadiness, whose 
integrity is unquestioned and whose word is good.'

He praised Ryan's prowess in politics,
saying that 'There are people that may disagree with Paul Ryan, but I 
don't know of anyone that doesn't respect his character and judgement.'

The pair are currently in the midst of a four-day bus tour of key swing states.
