Famous boxer Anthony Mundine, a close friend of Phillip Hughes, has broken his silence following the cricketer's tragic death on Thursday.

The pair were good friends, and Hughes attended a number of the boxer's matches to support Mundine from the side of the ring.

Mundine was seen visiting Hughes at St Vincent's Hospital a number of times during his final days, one of the only a select few outside of the cricket family who were allowed in.

The boxer has vowed to dedicate his next fight to the cricketer, telling The Sunday Telegraph that he 'will win it for Phillip'.

He also spoke about the last private moments the pair shared before Hughes passed away.

'I held his hand and told him I loved him,' Mundine said. 

'His manager said to me at the hospital, 'Phillip loved you, Choc' and I loved him, too.'

Following his passing, Mundine expressed his heartache in a tweet: 'I'm totally devastated by the passing of my little mate Phil Hughes. Words aren't enough. Sad sad day & great loss for mankind RIP my bra.' 

He recalled the moment the two first met while dining together at a restaurant in Rozelle in Sydney's inner-west in 2009 and said they had been close friends ever since.

Mundine described Hughes as a humble and decent person

'When you're with him, you got a chance to appreciate what a decent person he was. I never heard him say anything bad about anybody and he was always very humble,' he said.

Mundine and Hughes had plans to catch up for dinner on Thursday - the day Hughes' life support was turned off after he was struck in the head by a ball on the cricket field at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday. 

Mundine expressed his eternal gratitude for Hughes befriending him at a time when most others kept away from the boxer.

'A lot of people were putting sh** on me in those days,' Mundine said.

'But he told me that I inspired him as an athlete and I was really humbled by it.'
