Things have come a long way in the world of women's boxing.

In 2009 more than 100 years after women's boxing first featured as a demonstration sport it was accepted as an Olympic sport.  

Today one quarter of Britain's 149,000 registered boxers are female and last year Flyweight Olympic champion Nicola Adams received an MBE.

Ambreen is Britain's first Muslim female boxer and she says she has suffered serious prejudice

As Britain's first female Muslim boxer Ambreen Sadiq's story is especially impressive, but it is tinged with sadness as her passion for the sport has led to abuse and ridicule from the people who should support her most, her family.

The 20-year-old is a former national champion and is so far unbeaten in the women's competition and yet despite her successes she says that she had to fight serious prejudice to get where she is today.

Ambreen, from Keighley, Yorkshire, started boxing when she was suffering from racist bullying as a teenager and used it as a way of releasing her aggression.

Although boxing helped the teenager feel calmer, her new hobby attracted a lot of negative attention and encouraged yet more bullying. 

In an interview with The Telegraph, Ambreen says that her immediate family were extremely supportive with her father and brother getting her interested in the sport, but her father's extended family were not happy.

'My dad's family are Pakistani Muslims and they're very into their community. It was all "you're bringing shame into the culture" because I'm an Asian Muslim girl. If I was a boy it wouldn't matter.' she told the Radhika Sanghani. 

Ambreen revealed that although she is not a strict practicing Muslim she says that the boxing dress code upset some family members as it went against traditional dress.

'I told them, I'm not going in to look sexy - it's a uniform. I even asked (the Amateur Boxing Association) to change it and let me wear tracksuit bottoms. But they said no. I have tried to change it' she said.

In her interview she also revealed that she has been taunted by classmates and when her sister set up a Facebook group she even received death threats.

Amazingly Ambreen has been able to rise above her bullies and has enjoyed an extremely successful start to her boxing career. 

At just 15 she was shortlisted for Junior Personality of the Year at the British Asian Sports Awards, and won the ABA Schoolgirls' National Championship. 

She has even featured in a Channel 4 Documentary called, The Girl Boxer.

And now her story will be told on stage in a new play called No Guts, No Heart, No Glory to be shown at the Edinburgh Festival. 

Ambreen previously told the Daily Mail that she hopes to encourage other females to take part in the sport. 

'I hope my success inspires more and more girls to take up boxing. If so, they may soon outnumber the boys.'

Ambreen's coach Naz Jalil, added that she was blazing a trail for other Muslim girls who were interested in the sport.

'It's almost unheard of for an Asian Muslim girl to take up boxing but she is winning her uphill battle to prove that it is acceptable for females from her background to enter the ring.' 

No Guts, No Heart, No Glory is being performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival from 25 August
