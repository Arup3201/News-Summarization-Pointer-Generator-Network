Justin Bieber's good friend, rapper Lil Za has been 'arrested for cocaine possession' after police raided the 19-year-old singer's home in Calabasas on Tuesday.

A representative for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed the arrest for felony drug possession to TMZ, and said the cocaine was 'in plain view' during the raid.

Officials says Bieber was 'not connected' to the cocaine.

Arrest: Lil Za was arrested on Tuesday morning for 'drug possession' after police raided his friend Justin Bieber's mansion in connection with an egg attack on the singer's neighbour

Aerial images showed the rapper being led away by several officers before being driven to the police station in the back of a cop car.

Radar reports that Lil Za, real name Xavier Smith, has been 'living at Bieber's Calabasas home for months,' according to reports.

Police were searching Bieber's mansion to investigate an egg throwing incident
 at his next door neighbour's home.

The 19-year-old singer was earlier
'detained in his garage' while officers searched for surveillance video 
from his house that might shed some light on the incident, according to TMZ.

According to reports, Bieber allegedly caused more than
 $20,000 in damage during the vicious egg attack last Thursday.

Law enforcement sources told TMZ that 
eleven police cars descended on Bieber's mansion and are 'executing a 
search warrant in connection with the egg-throwing incident.'

Deputies were looking for any evidence 
linking the star with the egg assault including other eggs in the house.
 There was also a battering ram at the scene.

In
 California, if the damage is greater than $400 it becomes felony 
vandalism - a crime which could land Bieber in prison.

A source told RadarOnline.com that Justin was 'furious' at the raid.

'He is obviously upset that cops basically had free reign and are going through his personal belongings in his house,' the source said.

'Justin has been kept out of the house while the search warrant is being executed and is being watched over by several sheriff’s deputies.'

Police later issued a press release about the raid on Bieber's home.

It said: 'Search Warrant Served at Calabasas Home after Estimated $20,000 Vandalism on January 9.

'At
 about 8am on Tues, Jan. 14, 2014, detectives from Lost Hills/Malibu 
Sheriff’s Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department began 
service of a search warrant at the Calabasas home of Suspect Justin 
Bieber.

'The purpose of
 the search warrant is to seek video surveillance or other possible 
evidence in the vandalism that occurred on January 9, 2014. The 
vandalism damage is estimated by the homeowner to be approximately 
$20,000.00. The investigation is ongoing.'

Bieber was cooperative with the dozen deputies who arrived at his home on Tuesday, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Thompson, but he did not answer questions about the alleged vandalism.

The egg throwing incident was caught on camera and the neighbour can be shouting: 'I can f***ing see you!' as the
 footage shows the damage allegedly done by the star.

Featuring a gallery of images showing
 smashed eggs on the property, TMZ adds that there was also a 
verbal altercation between the pair with the neighbour shouting: 'What 
the hell are you doing?'

Then another voice, allegedly Justin's, shouts back: 'F**k you! I got another one for you, actually.'

An insider told TMZ the repairs are like to cost 
thousands of dollars because the pricey Venetian plaster on the outside 
of the house has to be redone.

According to the website, the entire front of
 the house needs to be re-plastered with Venetian plaster, which will 
cost around $15,000. An additional $5,000 is needed to to repair the 
entryway, including re-staining the doors.

Justin allegedly hasn't called the neighbour to apologise or offered to foot the bill.

'It's currently under investigation and [Justin Bieber] is a named suspect,' L.T. Jennifer Barsh told People at the time.

TMZ claims that the alleged incident was attended by the L.A. County Sheriff office, who were called to the scene as it unfolded.

The neighbour 'heard something 
banging against his house in Calabasas around 7:30pm on Thursday, and when
 he stepped on to a second floor balcony ... he says he saw Justin down 
below hurling eggs at his front door,' the website reported.

The neighbour's daughter, who TMZ reports is 13-years-old, then calls the police upon instruction from her father - and sounds clearly panicked.

Crack: Around 20 eggs were apparently thrown in the alleged attack

It is claimed the alleged attack involved around 20 eggs, while the 'victim' has told TMZ that the damage caused 'far exceeds $400'.

Officers from the LA County Sheriff department have confirmed that deputies responded to the call for assistance and obtained a statement.

It is not yet known if they spoke with Justin himself.

If true, the news is just the latest 
clash in the affluent LA city of Calabasas - which is located in the 
hills west of California's San Fernando Valley.

Justin has allegedly frequently upset neighbours with noisy house parties and speeding in recent months.

In March last year he was said to have spat in a neighbour's face after he was confronted over speeding in his Ferrari. The
 Los Angeles Sheriff's Department were said to be investigating the 
incident, during which Justin was alleged to have said: 'I'm going to 
f**king kill you.'

In November, police attended his home three times in one night when he held a major party.

According
 to TMZ, the noise got out of control and neighbours called the police 
at 1am, the LA County Sheriff's deputies then allegedly paid Bieber a 
call and told him to keep the noise down.

A representative for Justin has been approached by MailOnline, but is yet to respond.
