The American government believed a rogue FBI mole was passing secrets to the IRA at the time the group were plotting to assassinate Margaret Thatcher, it was reported last night.

Files released to The Guardian show that federal agents launched a series of investigations into alleged plots to murder the former Prime Minister during visits to the US.

One trusted source told the FBI that a ‘female, secretary type’ in the agency’s New York bureau was giving the provisional IRA ‘access to computers, name checks and ID’.

The documents, released after a freedom of information request following Lady Thatcher’s death, reveal this claim tallied with independent allegations of a leak.

Fears that the New York field office may have been compromised led William Sessions, then the FBI director, to order that access to all material relating to an apparent plot against Mrs Thatcher by two men linked to Sinn Féin must be restricted to a pair of senior officials.

The precautions followed several years of alleged plots detailed in the files.

In February 1981, two men with ‘English or Irish accents’ were overheard by an FBI source ‘of proven reliability’ in the cocktail lounge of the Boar’s Head restaurant in Falls Church, Virginia, seemingly discussing a ‘hit’ during a visit by Mrs Thatcher.

‘This will even the score for H,’ one man was overheard saying. FBI agents took this as a reference to the H-blocks of the Maze prison in Northern Ireland, where IRA members were being held.

‘The Iron Maiden is no better than any other bloody PM,’ the man went on.

The man was also said to have been heard referring to Bloody Sunday, ‘war’ and ‘blanket men’. 

Several IRA prisoners carried out a protest against their prison uniforms, in which they wore only blankets for several years.

The man’s drinking partner was said to have tried to ‘quiet him down’.

The FBI carried out surveillance of the restaurant while interviewing staff and alerting field offices around the region.

New York said that ‘three known IRA terrorists’ were known to be in the area.

Suspects were identified, but their names were redacted in the files released on Monday.

Also included were poor photocopies of photographs of the suspects that were circulated between agents. Delta Airlines was co-opted to help locate their flight records.

In the end, Mrs Thatcher’s visit to New York and Washington, where she was to collect an honorary degree from Georgetown University, passed without incident. By March 1981, the case was declared closed, the files show.

Several more threats against the Tory leader – of varying significance – emerged in the following years.

In 1987, a suicidal man from Florida was said to have threatened to kill Mrs Thatcher but ‘got lost’ on his way to Camp David, the presidential retreat where she was staying with Ronald Reagan.

In December 1989, a man with an English accent called the FBI from Southampton to warn that Mrs Thatcher and then president George Bush Sr were the targets of an assassination plot by a group going by the name ‘God’s Soldiers’.

A fresh plot emerged in July 1992, following Thatcher’s departure from 10 Downing Street and in advance of a speaking trip to the US.

A tip-off arrived from a trusted FBI asset based in Boston, who was apparently working undercover in American-based IRA circles and had learned of the plot in a New York bar identified as a ‘hotbed’ of IRA activity.

The investigation was taken very seriously. Dozens of pages of files were created, and the mole inquiry was launched. Two known IRA operatives thought to have been behind past attacks in the UK and said to have fled California for New York, were identified as the prime suspects – although their names were also redacted in Monday’s release.

However, Mrs Thatcher’s visit again passed without an attack. She was able to complete her 12-day itinerary, which as well as a visit to President Bush in the White House and lunches with high-powered American officials, included six separate hair appointments.
