Reggie Bush is the latest athlete to come to the defense of Adrian Peterson in the wake of his indictment on child abuse charges last week, saying he will discipline his own daughter in the same manner Peterson disciplined his son.

Appearing today on the Boomer & Carton show, the 29-year-old Detroit Lions running back said Peterson should never have been suspended from league play after getting in trouble for beating his son with a switch.

He then added that if his daughter behaved inappropriately, she too would receive a punishment similar to the one Peterson gave his son.

Too much?: Bush said he would be sure not to hit his daughter Briseis (left with mother Lilit Avagyan, right with Bush) so hard that she was left bruised like Peterson's son

Bush's daughter Briseis is just one-year-old.

'I have a one-year-old daughter, and I discipline her,' he said during the interview. 

'I definitely will try to — will obviously not leave bruises or anything like that on her. But I definitely will discipline her harshly depending on what the situation is.'

According to CBS 2 New York, Bush, who used to date Kim Kardashian, was then asked if he would ever hit his daughter with a switch, to which he responded, 'I would possibly consider it, depending on what she did.'

Bush chalked up his opinion on the subject to the fact that he was disciplined in the same way as Peterson's son when he was younger. 

This weekend, former NBA star Charles Barkley also defended Peterson, saying the type of punishment the NFL star doled out is common among 'black parents in the South.'

One person who is not coming to Peterson's defense however, is Minnesota Vikings Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton, who said earlier today he is 'embarrassed' by his former team's decision to allow Peterson back on the field this weekend.

'These are serious accusations,' he told Fox News.

'And the only way you’re going to get the attention of an NFL player is to take away his paycheck and take him off the field. This is way above winning or losing a football game. I strongly disagree with the notion of playing him this week.'

Former Viking Cris Carter also said that he felt Peterson should not be playing when he appeared on NFL Sunday this weekend. 

This all stems from an incident last May when Peterson hit his four-year-old son so hard the child was left with bruises and open wounds.

Peterson faces up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine if found guilty.
