Wet weather continued to batter Britain last night, as torrential rain, thunderstorms and 50mph winds swept across coastal areas.

The bad weather wreaked havoc in Lossiemouth, Moray, where almost 1ft of foamy surface water broke through the harbour wall, after it was beaten down by huge, crashing waves at high tide.

The seawater swamped the roads surrounding the harbour, forcing police to stop residents and motorists moving through the area due to the risk of danger. The mayhem was compounded by strong winds of around 40mph, which swept inland from the coast.

The mayhem broke out at high tide after strong winds whipped up a frenzy of waves which broke through the harbour wall

This morning, Police Scotland warned that severe weather and heavy rain is causing disruption across the country, particularly on roads around Inverness.

They are advising motorists to take extra care when travelling, after heavy rain overnight closed some roads and left others covered in standing water.

Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire was also hit by wild weather and flooding, as the waves crashed onto the harbour during high tide. The waves spilled over the harbour wall for around four hours, leaving deep surface water on the roads, pavements and car parks nearby. 

The aftermath of the high tide storm was evident when smaller stones, cobbles, sand and even some boulders were seen scattered over the promenade. Police were forced to close the pier as they tried to salvage the wreckage and make the area safe again.

This three-day forecast shows heavy rain across many parts of the UK for the next few days, particularly in the south and west of England, and in Wales

A band of rain is sweeping across Scotland and will move down across the UK

In Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, gusts of almost 50mph were recorded, while the Shetland Islands were hit by wind speeds of 69mph. 

A spokesman for the Met Office said the high tide storms had been caused by spring tides peaking, mixed with the strength and direction of the gusts of wind. 

Meanwhile, a mini whirlcloud was spotted across the sky as a storm passed over Porthcawl, South Wales, last night  

And it seems there is no end in sight to the bad weather, with forecasters predicting the gusty winds and heavy downpours will continue until at least the end of the week.

It comes after the driest September since records began, the Met Office said. 

Meteogroup said heavy and thundery showers will continue  today and tonight across Wales, south west England, north west England and south west Scotland.

Forecasters said there will be spells of rain across eastern Scotland, which will push up towards the Northern Isles tomorrow morning. 

Remaining parts of Scotland could be mainly dry with some clear spells, but there will also be a lot of cloud, with some mist and fog.

Across the rest of England, the rain could ease, but there will still be a strong breeze overnight.  

As of 9.30am today, the Environment Agency had issued 40 flood warnings, 20 of which are in the south east. 

There are seven in place in both the south west and Wales and four nin place for the north west. 

The weather is then expected to turn breezy and windy across England and Wales tomorrow, with western England and Wales experiencing often heavy and thundery showers with some torrential downpours. 

Even those parts of England which will see spells of sunshine will also have showers moving in from the west, it said. 

On Friday, Meteogroup said north east Scotland looks set to be largely dry  with spells of sunshine.

Across the rest of the UK, there will be sunny spells but this will be peppered with showers, which could be heavy with the risk of thunder. 

The showers are expected to be most frequent in the south and west of England and Wales.

By Saturday, there could be a few showers  in northern Scotland, but there should be a lot of dry weather around.

But in the UK, it will be another mixed day of sunshine and showers.

Forecasters say the showers could be 'heavy and prolonged for a time', especially in the west, with the risk of thunder.

These showers are expected to be most frequent in Wales and the south and west of England, while most of the sunshine will be in Scotland. 

In Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, gusts of almost 50mph were recorded, causing huge high tide storms
