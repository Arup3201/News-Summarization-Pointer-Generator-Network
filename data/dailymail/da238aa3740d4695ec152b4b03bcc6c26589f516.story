Revenge plastic surgery following a divorce is a new trend on the rise in the UK

It is nothing unusual for a recently divorced woman to spruce herself up a bit before reentering the dating game.

But a growing number of divorcees are going one step further and turning to the scalpel in an attempt to reinvent themselves.

Dubbed 'revenge plastic surgery', more and more newly single women (and men) are choosing to go under the knife, sometimes for drastic procedures, in a bid to transform their bodies and, it has been said, to make their ex jealous.

Transform Plastic Surgery Group report that 26 per cent of plastic surgery patients are now recently divorced women, and 11 per cent are recently divorced men, a rise on last year.

Procedures range from fillers and Botox to more invasive surgeries like full body lifts and breast implants.

The trend has been on the rise in the U.S. for years, with demand there now so high that several plastic surgery clinics have started offering post-divorce discounts and procedure packages.

And as is so often the case, the trend now seems to be reaching the UK.

Many people feel they ‘let themselves go’ during a marriage and, once they find themselves back on the dating scene at an older age after a divorce, prompting a crisis in confidence.

Or they simply wish to show their ex what they have lost - and what they are missing.

But while going under the knife may seem like an easy way to make your ex jealous and hit single life with renewed confidence, plastic surgeons warn that having permanent procedures done for the benefit of somebody else is ill advised.

Top plastic surgeon Dr. Brent Moelleken says of the trend in revenge surgery: 'I personally believe this is part of the grieving process when a relationship ends.

‘It's never a good idea to have plastic surgery for somebody else, only for yourself.

‘Some people are unhappy with their surgery because they did it for their ex. When things don't work out, they blame their surgery for not fixing the problem.

'So experienced plastic surgeons are watchful for patients who are doing surgery for the wrong reason.’
