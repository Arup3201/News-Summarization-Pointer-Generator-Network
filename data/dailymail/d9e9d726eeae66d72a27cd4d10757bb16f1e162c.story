Gurbaksh Chahal, the multimillionaire tech CEO accused of kicking and punching his girlfriend 117 times in a frenzied 30-minute attack, has contacted police to claim he is being harassed by an 'obsessed female fan'. 

The 31-year-old, who was recently fired as CEO from online ad network RadiumOne following a major public backlash to his domestic violence charges, filed a police report this month against South Carolina accountant Parveen Bining.

On June 13, Chahal reported that he was still being harassed by Ms Bining to Spartanburg Police Department in South Carolina. In a brief report, he is described as a ‘public figure who lives in San Francisco, California and the suspect is a female fan who is obsessed with him’.  

Ms Bining, 28, has allegedly been contacting Chahal again after two years by sending unwanted emails to his sister, Kamal Chahal, and his close friend Laura Bae ‘in an attempt to interfere with his personal  and professional life’.

Parveen Bining, a 28-year-old accountant from Spartanburg, South Carolina, has been accused by Gurbaksh Chahal of stalking him online

Chahal, who previously sold an ad tech company to Yahoo! for $300 million, previously had his personal assistant call Spartanburg police in 2012 to report unwanted texts, emails and posts from Ms Bining.

The 28-year-old accountant denied the harassment in an interview with The Smoking Gun and said she had exchanged messages with the tech tycoon when she contacted him via Facebook. 

She has not met him and no charges have been filed against her by police. Calls to Ms Bining by MailOnline went unanswered on Wednesday.

Spartanburg police told MailOnline today that they were still investigating. 

Chahal's sacking in April came after news website TechCrunch dumped RadiumOne as a sponsor of the 'Disrupt NY' technology conference, calling Chahal a 'violent, angry man' who had not been held accountable for his actions.

Chahal was charged with 45 felony counts for the brutal attack on his girlfriend in his San Francisco penthouse in 2013. He was freed on $1million bail.

The beating was caught on surveillance cameras in his bedroom, however the evidence was ruled inadmissible in court because police obtained it without a warrant.

The victim also stopped cooperating with prosecutors.

Chahal then pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course.

The RadiumOne board of directors terminated Chahal in April, saying in a statement that Chief Operating Officer Bill Lonergan will be taking over as CEO, according to Re/code.

The decision followed an open letter that was posted online by Leena Rao, a senior editor at TechCrunch, who said Chahal's actions were unacceptable.

'You see, I am afraid that this world is at risk of being a place where people are known to sacrifice ethics, and values, and sometimes genuine human decency in exchange for making money,' Rao said in the letter, according to The Huffington Post.

'This scares me, as does the fact that a violent, angry man is being left to prosper without full responsibility and retribution for his crimes.'

Under Chahal's command, RadiumOne is one of the most powerful online advertising platforms in the world and is expected to generate $100 million in revenue this year.

It was set to sponsor the 'Hackathon' portion of the three-day Disrupt technology and startup conference taking place in New York City next week.

But after social media erupted with outrage over Chahal's sentencing, it seems RadiumOne has been severely tarnished.

But Chahal defended himself on his blog and did not deny beating his former girlfriend. He claimed that although his temper 'got the better' of him, 'there is a difference between temper and domestic violence'.

He also said his temper was sparked by discovering his girlfriend 'was having unprotected sex for money with other people'.

Police were called to Chahal’s Infinity Towers penthouse apartment after a 911-call about domestic violence on August 5, 2013.

Chahal, is alleged to have horrifically assaulted his girlfriend - who cannot be identified - over a period of half an hour, while also repeatedly threatening to kill her.

San Francisco police pulled security footage from Chahal's bedroom and used it to charge him with 45 felony crimes and two misdemeanors.

Among the 45 counts were Assault With a Deadly Weapon (not a firearm), which in this case is cited as a pillow.

However, as the court case proceeded, a judge ruled the video inadmissible as the San Francisco Police Department had obtained it without a warrant. Chahal’s girlfriend also withdrew her testimony and refused to cooperate.

In the end, on April 16, Chahal pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years’ probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course.

Despite the incident in August, the recent court case and guilty plea, Chahal remained in his position at RadiumOne, as well as working as a motivational speaker and lecturer.

He also continued to publish 'inspirational posts' on his social media channels.

These recently included: '15 Things Leaders Never Do', 'If you’re looking for a role model. Don’t look outside, just look inside.' and 'When you want to succeed as bad you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful'.

He allegedly smothered his girlfriend for 20 seconds.

‘She stated she was unable to breathe,’ San Francisco Police Officer Anh Nguyen, told the court during a preliminary hearing last month, San Francisco Business Times reports.

'She stated that he said, “I’m going to kill you” four times. She stated she was in fear for her life.’

Indian-born Chahal moved to California with his family when he was four and founded his first start-up in his bedroom after dropping out of high-school.

Aged 18 he sold ClickAgents, an online company making revenue from performance-based advertising, for $40million.

Four years later, he formed BlueLithium, which was one of the first companies to track users online habits to tailor advertising - a system now found all over the internet.

He sold it to Yahoo! in 2007 for $300million in cash.

Chahal has also made numerous TV appearances, including a lengthy interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2009, a philanthropic stint on Secret Millionaire and was named America's most eligible bachelor by Extra TV five years ago.

His autobiography, released at the age of 27, is called The Dream: How I Learned the Risks and Rewards of Entrepreneurship and Made Millions.

The San Francisco District Attorney's Office issued a statement after Chahal's guilty plea which said: ‘We disagree with the judge’s suppression of the video. The judge’s ruling substantially weakened the evidence we had for prosecution.

‘Though it is not the outcome we had hoped for, the case has reached a resolution where the defendant acknowledges guilt, is placed on domestic violence probation and has to take domestic violence classes.’
