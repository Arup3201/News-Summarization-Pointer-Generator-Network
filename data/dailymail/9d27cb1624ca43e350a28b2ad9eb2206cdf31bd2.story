The skipper of a Â£500,000 luxury cruiser was left red-faced after it became stuck underneath a bridge on the River Thames.

The 40ft long boat was too high to pass through Chertsey Bridge in Surrey and became wedged under the archway.

It is understood the skipper had misjudged how much the river level has risen because of the recent wet weather and underestimated the clearance needed to get through.

Rescue: Emergency services were called to the scene after reports that the boat had crashed and was sinking

Embarrassed: The two people on board had to be rescued from the boat by fire crews using ropes

Fire crews were called to the scene this afternoon after the fast-flowing river swept the boat underneath the bridge before it was too late.

Emergency services had to close the bridge between Chertsey and Laleham to rescue the two people on board using ropes.

A spokesperson for the fire brigade said they were initially called to reports that a boat had crashed into the bridge and was potentially sinking with two people on board.

'We sent two fire engines and our boat rescue team to the scene,' he said.

'The boat was not sinking but was wedged under the bridge and I believe they were having trouble with their engine.

'With the assistance of a boat from a nearby boatyard we managed to remove the boat using ropes.'

The boat was later taken to a nearby lock to have the damaged assessed. Neither of the people aboard was injured.
