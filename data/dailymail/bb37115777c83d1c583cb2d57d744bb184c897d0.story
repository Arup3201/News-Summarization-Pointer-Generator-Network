A grieving mother killed her son and 
then committed suicide just three months after marrying for the second 
time, shocked neighbours have claimed.

Tragic Michelle Stephen is understood 
to have suffocated Leon, five, as she struggled to cope with the recent 
death of her father.

The 31-year-old clerical assistant and
her son were found dead in their Edinburgh home on Tuesday afternoon by
Barry Stephen, whom she married last November.

Tragedy: Michelle Stephen and her son Leon were found dead in the Parkhead Grove area of Edinburgh

'You are with the angels': Flowers left at the scene where the bodies of Mrs Weston and her child were found

A police insider said it appeared that Leon had been suffocated.

Mrs Stephen, who would have celebrated her 32nd birthday on March 11, had killed herself using the same method.

According to the source, she had 
called Leon’s school in the Sighthill area of the city earlier in the 
day to say he would not be coming in.

Locals said Mrs Stephen had been struggling to cope following the recent death of her father, Jim Weir.

The 57-year-old prison officer died of
cancer late last year and it is understood his daughter brought her 
wedding forward so that he could attend.

Today, Mr Stephen was being comforted 
at his parents’ home nearby. Mr Stephen answered the intercom at the 
block of flats to say: ‘I really don’t want to talk about what’s 
happened.’

His mother, Sharon, then came to the 
door of their flat to say: ‘Barry is devastated and I am devastated - we
really don’t want to talk about it.’

Inquiries: Police cordoned off the cul-de-sac in the rundown Sighthill suburb

Born Michelle Weir, she married Kevin Weston - Leon’s father - in 2004.

The couple divorced in 2009 and Mr Weston, who now lives in Dalkeith, Midlothian, also declined to speak to the press today.

Mrs Stephen married again at the upmarket, £230-a-night Braid Hill Hotel in the city’s Morningside district.

It is understood she worked at St Augustine’s RC High School in the city.

Chief Insp Richard Thomas of Lothian and Borders Police spoke to journalists at the scene.

He said: ‘At around 5 o’clock last night, a treble 9 call was received at this address.

‘Police attended quickly to the scene and found two bodies, that of a 31-year-old woman and a five-year-old boy.

‘It is a very tragic set of circumstances and it is very early in the investigation process.

‘There is a police presence in the area to reassure residents.

'There is an inquiry team at Leith carrying out inquiries.’

Ch Insp Thomas said officers were ‘not in a position to confirm who lived with the woman’.

He added: ‘Post mortems will be carried out and we will notify next of kin.

‘The deaths are being treated as unexplained.

‘We can confirm that the bodies were found within the house. The times of death cannot be confirmed at this early stage.’

Last night, police cordoned off the 
cul-de-sac in the rundown Sighthill suburb in the west of the city and 
friends and family left tributes by the house.

Shocking: Mrs Weston and her child were discovered inside their home

Mrs Stephen bought the home in Parkhead Grove last year but was brought up in the area. She had recently married.

It is believed she was left grief-stricken after the death of her father, Jim Weir, last month.  

He had been a well-respected prison officer and was very close to his daughter.

An Edinburgh City Council spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the police investigation and will provide all the assistance we can.’

The skyline of Sighthill was dominated for decades by high rise tower blocks. The suburb is earmarked for regeneration.

Last year, three multi-storey tower blocks containing 285 homes were demolished to make way for a housing development for sale and for rent.
