Miss G, whose identity has been kept secret by a judge, says she may be crippled with a metal knee, but knows how to look after herself and doesn't want the state interfering in her life

A frail spinster of 94 has asked a High Court judge to stop her local council interfering in her life and leave her in peace at her £350,000 home.

A two-day hearing was told social workers and police were sent to her house 12 times in nine months to investigate if her private live-in carers looked after her properly.

The case was brought by the council which believes her decisions are unduly influenced by the carers, a married couple. They may now be removed from her home.

Social workers asked the judge to decide if the spinster had mental capacity to decide on her financial affairs and living arrangements.

But the pensioner, a retired NHS midwife identified only as Miss G, told the judge: ‘I am a grown woman. I know who I want to live in my home and who I choose to stay there with me.

‘I am crippled with a metal knee but I can manage my own affairs. Nobody tells me what to do. I don’t want these people from the council persecuting us. It is malicious interference in my business.

Referring to her carers, identified as Mr and Mrs C, she added: ‘We are a family together and we want to live in peace.’

The hearing was made open to the Press after Miss G gave the judge a signed statement asking for ‘the names of myself and the council which has brought these legal proceedings made public.

‘I would also like it known that my express wish is to remain in my own home, with my current 24-hour carers, and without social services intrusion.’

Miss G asked to hire her own independent lawyer, but the court decided she should be represented by the Official Solicitor (a state-appointed lawyer) whom she met only a few minutes before the hearing began.

During the case in London, Miss G was made to sit on a wooden bench through nearly nine hours of evidence by lawyers and medical experts at a cost to the public purse of thousands of pounds.

On four occasions, Miss G put up her hand to get the attention of the judge and stated in a clear soft voice that she did not want the council interfering in her life and was happy with her private carers.

Judge Mrs Justice Russell ordered that the identity of Miss G, her carers, the council and the medical experts should remain secret for the time being.

This is despite a ruling last month by Sir James Munby, the top family court judge, that councils applying to remove children into care or take control of the lives of the old and sick can no longer hide behind a cloak of anonymity.

Sitting at the High Court in London, Judge Mr Justice Russell ordered the woman's identity and that of her carers to remain secret despite Miss G signing a form waiving her anonymity

Expert witnesses and social workers should, he said, be named in public. The landmark change breaks a silence that has surrounded family justice for a quarter of a century and follows a campaign against the secrecy in family courts by the Daily Mail.

After the hearing, Miss G told the Mail: ‘I do not want to be silenced about how council social workers have treated me.

'I invited this couple to live with me as family 18 months ago. We come from the same part of the Caribbean and the female carer and I are distant relatives.

'The council began to make false accusations against the two of them and interfered in my life.’

She added: ‘I was frightened when the social workers and police kept bursting into my home.

‘The council carers from an agency cut short my visits and did not shower me very often in two years.

‘There were rats in my house and everything smelt. I was in a bad state when I invited the private carers to live with me instead.’

Barbara Hewson, barrister for Mrs C, said the council’s care agency team had eaten Miss G’s food and left the fridge empty so there was nothing for her.

She said the council had put ‘intense pressure’ on Miss G, adding: ‘The level of state intrusion has been oppressive.’

And she added that Miss G called Mrs C her ‘niece’, which gave a sense of the esteem in which she held her.

The court heard that Miss G owned her own house on the outskirts of London and has an NHS pension and savings.

Three medical experts gave evidence on Miss G’s mental capacity. One, a psychologist hired by Miss G, said she had told him her female carer was ‘like a daughter’ to her.

Miss G had said: ‘She does everything for me, gardening, cooking, combing my hair, looking after me. She is very caring. We have some quarrels from time to time, like any family. I trust her because she is honest.’

The psychologist added she had completed many of the mental tests ‘satisfactorily’, although she might need some help in the future to monitor her financial affairs.

Mrs Justice Russell said it was important to make sure Miss G was ‘not suffering from undue pressure from anyone’, adding: ‘The difficulty is that questions have been raised about the care she receives. The court has a duty to protect her.’

She reserved judgment and will give a preliminary ruling next week on whether Miss G has mental capacity to decide her own affairs.
