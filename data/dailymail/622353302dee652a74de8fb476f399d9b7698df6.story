Without a trace of fear, Britain's Olympic divers frolic and pose for photos on the top diving board - not giving the 10m drop a second thought.

The lads let off steam after a tough training session by leaping in the air and performing karate kicks as their female teammates capture their acrobatics on camera.

And not wanting to be outdone, the girls prove they're every bit as brave by jumping about right near the edge.

He will be the focus of a thousand 
camera lenses at the London Games, but gold medal hopeful Tom Daley 
seemed to be the one capturing all the fun here.

He snapped close friend Tonia Couch 
sitting on the edge of the board on a a mobile phone with patriotic 
Union Jack case and then got a few souvenir pcitures of teammates Jack 
Laugher and Chris Mears too.

The divers found time for the fun and frolics during one of their final training sessions before the Olympics begin.

Daley, 18, practised individually and alongside 10m synchronised platform partner Peter Waterfield at the Aquatics Centre.

Mears and Laugher worked to perfect 
their routines on the 3m springboard before climbing up to join Daley, 
Couch and Sarah Barrow on the top board.

Daley has announced that he will swap 
the Olympic village for a training camp in Southend between his events 
in order to escape the pressure and hype of the Games.

On Monday, he will compete alongside Waterfield in the synchro before an 11-day wait for the individual event.

British Diving performance director 
Alexei Evangulov has ordered Daley to decamp from the village for six 
days to ensure he is in top form.

The whole British diving team trained in the Essex seaside resort before the Games.

Evangulov said: 'From my experience 
working with the Russian team we always try to escape from the Olympic 
environment because you can be exhausted emotionally.

'You can be good physically but 
emotionally you can be tired. That's why we decided to get a rest from 
the Olympic environment - we needed some solitude.

'That's why we are going for five to six days. Southend is the best base and diving facility in this country.

'Tom prefers his home at Plymouth but it is a bit far. Southend is just one hour drive, that's why we picked this base.'
