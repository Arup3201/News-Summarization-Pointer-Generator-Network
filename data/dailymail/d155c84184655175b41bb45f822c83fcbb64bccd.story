Aslan Usoyan, one of Russia's most notorious criminal bosses, has been shot dead in a street in Moscow

One of Russia's most notorious crime bosses has been shot dead by a sniper in broad daylight in central Moscow.

Aslan Usoyan, 75, who has survived time in Soviet jails and previous assassination attempts, is thought to have been murdered in a war between two mobs.

He was shot in the head yesterday outside a restaurant on a snowy street about half a mile from the Kremlin in the middle of the afternoon.

Georgian-born Usoyan, also known as 
'Grandpa Hasan', is said to have been the head of one of the region's 
most powerful criminal gangs

The federal Investigative Committee said an unidentified gunman hit Usoyan with a single bullet and he died shortly afterwards in hospital.

It said a woman at the scene also suffered two gunshot wounds.

A committee statement said six 9mm bullet casings were found on a stairwell in a building across the street from where Usoyan was hit.

Authorities, it said, were conducting ballistics tests and considering potential motives 'connected to the criminal activity of the victim and possible conflicts with other representatives of the same milieu.'

After the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, there were almost daily killings across Russia as criminal gangs battled to gain control of lucrative businesses and carve up territory.

According to Russian media reports, Usoyan headed a crime network in the years after the Soviet collapse.

Since 2006, he had been at war with another criminal group, according to organised crime experts.

Russian media said the battle between the two clans had intensified in recent years.

Usoyan survived a contract hit in September 2010 when a gunman shot him in the stomach as he got out of his car near his apartment on Moscow's main street.

Media reports at the time linked that shooting to a conflict between crime groups.

The Investigative Committee said Usoyan had survived more than one assassination attempt.

His killing echoed that of criminal boss Vyacheslav Ivankov, known as Yaponchik, whose saga also spanned the communist and post-Soviet eras but included jail in the United States on extortion charges.

Ivankov was shot in the stomach by a sniper in Moscow in July 2009 and died that October.
