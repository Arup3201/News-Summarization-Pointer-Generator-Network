The accused did not appear via an audio visual link from jail in Penrith Local Court during a very brief hearing before Magistrate Roger Clisdell. She is next due to appear on January 16.

One friend posted ''It will be worth it after all - the lyrics of that song will giv u comfort n will make u strong ... Ur not alone ur church family around the world are praying for you ... just stay focus n look up on Jesus'.

Several friends posted 'AIGA', which means 'always in God's arms'. 

The woman, who is the daughter of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor in Samoa, had been living with her aunt and uncle in the western Sydney suburb of Quakers Hill when she became pregnant and kept her condition secret for nine months, according to police. 

After giving birth to a healthy baby boy at Blacktown hospital at 1am on November 18, she discharged herself early that afternoon and, police allege, took her baby and placed him in a stormwater drain around 500 metres from her home. 

It's believed the baby was dropped through a small opening and fell around 2.5 metres to the bottom of the drain.

The baby then lay for five days in hot, dry conditions until his discovery by Sydney man David Otte and his daughter Hayley on the morning of Sunday, November 23. 

The pair heard cries coming from the drain as they were cycling and stopped to investigate what they at first assumed would be a small animal. When they discovered the baby, they called emergency services. 

Secrets and lies: The Samoan woman (pictured) who allegedly attempted to kill her newborn son kept her pregnancy a secret, but could not contain her mounting obsession with babies as her came closer to giving birth herself. She will appear in court on December 10 by video link from a Sydney women's prison

Police from Quakers Hill Local Area Command retrieved the baby, which was wrapped in a pink striped blanket, from the drain.

The baby had blood on his head and was taken to hospital where he was found to be severely dehydrated with bleeding on the brain.

Now 24 days old, the baby has been released from hospital and is in care. 

Doctors said the baby was able to survive his experience in the drain because conditions were dry and due to his extreme youth. 

After police tracked down the mother, she was charged with attempted murder and has been held in a Sydney women's prison for the last three weeks.

Magistrate Clisdell said that the woman was refused bail. Relatives told Daily Mail Australia they had been unaware of the woman's pregnancy and did not know who the father could be. 

Daily Mail Australia has learned the woman had a boyfriend of Samoan ancestry. She also has a five-year-old son from another relationship living in New Zealand.

While she has been accused of dumping her day-old baby down a drain and leaving him to die, the 30-year-old is also thought to be a loving aunt who adores children and appears entirely devoted to her family in Australia and Samoa, Daily Mail Australia can reveal. 

One of her social media accounts is filled with pictures of babies and young relatives. A family friend has told Daily Mail Australia that the young woman - who goes by an anglicised nickname and works in western Sydney - 'loves children and is very good with children'.

The son of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor, who leads the church attended by the woman and her family, told Daily Mail Australia that his father had spoken to the woman in prison two weeks ago.

He said she 'was trying to keep on top of things' while incarcerated in a Sydney jail, believed to be the Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre.

He described her as a 'very happy person' who was 'very good around children and young people at the church'.

He said that she is 'a quiet girl' but that 'she's an island girl, so she's got a bit of bite in her' and that might help her cope while in prison awaiting trial for attempted murder. 

Relatives of the accused woman (pictured leaving Blacktown Court last week) are distraught and confused about the events leading up to the 30-year-old allegedly dumping her newborn son in a drain

The accused woman's aunt (pictured, left) said she did not know who the father of her niece's baby could be

Court documents state the child was placed in the 2.4 metre deep drain less than 24 hours after he was born at Blacktown Hospital.

'The accused makes full admissions to putting the baby down the drain knowing it may kill the baby,' court documents claim.

The young woman's social media postings reveal friends and family are distraught over the events, and are still unable to come to terms with the attempted murder charge.

Her social media account also reveals that in the months leading up to the day the woman secretly gave birth,  the woman posts photo after photo of newborn relatives with loving messages.

'Happy  Eleven Weeks Princess', she has posted with double pictures of an infant dressed in pink.

In another post from earlier this year, below a photograph of her with a relative's baby, she says, 'Awww, it's mine'.

Another post with photos of the same baby dressed in a singlet and nappy has 'I love you' written with the accused's name next to it.

In earlier posts, the young woman's life appears to revolve around her work friends, family and the church.

Last year, she posted a birthday message to her aunt, with whom she was living in Quakers Hill until her arrest, saying 'Happy Birthday to the lady of our house an amazing, aunty, mom, chef ... hero!! Thank God for you [and] may our Good Lord continue to Bless you with many more years to come. Love you loads xox'

She is pictured at a relative's wedding in a black dress and carrying a bouquet.

The landlord of the house (pictured) where the young Samoan woman lived while hiding her secret pregnancy said he had seen her about three months ago and noticed she had 'put on weight'

She also posted pictures of herself attending a church concert and celebrating birthdays with work friends.

In a posting in March last year of herself with a young boy she says 'happy 4th birthday to my son' and says 'cant wait to c u again' and 'miss u mate'. 

On Thursday, Samoan friends put up a poster which said 'Stay Strong and God will be with you' accompanied by the note, 'God be with you Sis'.

The day after the woman made her first court appearance  accused of attempted murderer, a close relative posted on Facebook, 'HEARTBREAKING - feeling sad'.

A flurry of responses from friends and relatives in Australia, New Zealand and Samoa included 'Pray Mama, just pray!!' and 'Shocking..... Shocking.... Omg, still can't believe it!!'.

The woman, believed to be an aunt of the accued, responded, 'Thanks guys right now i feel so empty i can't eat or sleep ... I'm still crying, sorry I can't help it'.

The friends responded: 'I know but be strong ok, we're here to give you our strength and love so you can do the same for her. Rest your mind, body and heart you're gonna need the strength tomorrow. Love you xx'

'Love u so much [name deleted] we will get through this we have a special family and now is the time when we need each other the most.'

The landlord of the house where the woman had been living with her extended family for at least two years said he had noticed the young woman had put on weight two or three months ago.

'I was delivering the water bill and I saw she was bigger and wearing loose clothes, but I didn't say anything.

'They are a very good family, clean. I see them with their Bibles.'
