Victims of alleged historical child abuse have told Theresa May they are withdrawing support from the Government’s paedophile inquiry.

A total of 23 individuals sent the Home Secretary a letter claiming the inquiry was ‘not fit for purpose’.

It came ahead of a crunch meeting today between Mrs May and some of the largest groups for child sex abuse victims which could lead to the inquiry being undermined.

Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said his organisation had not signed the letter – but insisted it echoed the views of the other abuse survivors.

He said Mrs May must pledge to give the beleaguered inquiry extra powers, including granting it statutory powers to compel witnesses to give evidence and to properly consult victims’ groups.

‘At the end of the meeting, if we feel the Home Secretary is not serious about getting the inquiry right, then we will probably walk away, but until then it is too early to say. I believe she is committed to it; now she must show that commitment.’

‘I am not hopeful that we will get what we want.’

The letter to Mrs May said the 23 signatories would not take up an offer to attend the meeting.

It said: ‘We, alongside many survivors, have made numerous representations to you regarding our view that the Inquiry as it stands is not fit for purpose.

‘The Home Office seems to be running the inquiry to meet others’ needs rather than those of survivors and the public.

’We therefore have little option but to end engagement with the Inquiry and call on other survivors, whistleblowers, associated professionals and agencies to follow suit.’

Mrs May set up a government inquiry into historical child abuse in the summer amid incendiary claims there was an Establishment cover-up of a murderous paedophile ring around Westminster in the 1980s.

But she has struggled to put in place a chairman who retains the confidence of victims’ groups. Baroness Butler-Sloss and Fiona Woolf have quit the role amid concerns about their links to figures alleged to be involved in the alleged cover-up.

Mrs May said: ‘I am aware of the letter, I have been speaking to survivors, various groups of survivors and representatives of those groups and listening to the issues they have raised. The issues in the letter have been raised previously and we are looking at them.

‘I am very clear that we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to get to the bottom of this issue and what has happened.

'Why is it that over the years - not just in the past but as we have seen in Rochdale, Rotherham and Greater Manchester that it is happening today – why is it that institutions, parts of governments, agencies including police and local authorities whose duty it is to protect children have been failing in that duty. We need to look into that and learn lessons for the future.’
