Cassano made a series of offensive comments about Jews. In November 2011 he tweeted: 'I like jews about as much as hitler #toofar? NOPE.'

He frequently used the derogatory term 'shwoog' to refer to blacks. Last August, Cassano, who lives in the family home on Staten Island, stated: 'News flash to half of the island. ur white! Stop talking like ur a shwoog.'

On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, he wrote, 'MLK could go kick rocks for all I care, but thanks for the time and a half today.'

Cassano often complained about his job, calling it 'the worst' and mocking members of the public.

'Getting sick of picking up all these obama lovers and taking them to the hospital because their medicare pays for an ambulance and not a cab,' Cassano messaged in February.

On another occasion he said: 'Gotta love people with the iPhone 5 and brand new Jordan’s whip out their benefits card #f--kobama #ipaidforyourstuff.'

And before the 2012 election, he pledged to 'move to Scotland' if President Obama was re-elected.

The 23-year-old also tweeted his crude attitudes towards women. In November he said: 'I love boob jobs... I wish every girl in America were forced to get one once they turn 18.'

Around the same time Cassano boasted: 'I’ll vote in the presidential election when a candidates main purpose is to make breast enhancement surgery free to all who want it.'

His Twitter account is now shut down, but his final tweet was: 'I really don't worry if I make alot of money in my life, as soon as I can buy my wife new tits ill be a happy man.'

Commissioner Salvatore J. Cassano called the situation 'very painful.' He said Monday he loves his son and believes his resignation was the right decision.

The commissioner added: 'I am extremely disappointed in the comments posted online by my son Joseph, which do not reflect the values - including a respect for all people - that are held by me, my family and the FDNY.'

The commissioner sais the department has worked hard to achieve diversity, inclusiveness and a good reputation.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg stated he was among those who found the messages offensive.
