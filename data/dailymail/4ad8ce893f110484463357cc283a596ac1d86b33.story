John David Martinez, 68, was caught by police in just five hours after robbing a bank without a mask, wearing a T-shirt with his first name on it, and driving his own car to the crime scene

When robbing a bank, most thieves opt for a balaclava or at least a pair of tights over their heads to protect their identity.

But one clueless criminal in Denver was caught by police after holding up a branch of Wells Fargo without a mask - while he was also wearing a t-shirt with his first name written on the front.

As an added help for detectives, 68-year-old John David Martinez even drove a car registered in his name to the stick-up.

The poorly-planned raid happened on Tuesday at 9am when Martinez drove his silver Honda sedan to a branch of Wells Fargo bank in Denver, Colorado, at around 9am before walking inside and speaking to a female teller.

After she greeted him, Martinez said: 'This is a robbery, give me the money.'

According to ABC 7News Denver, Martinez handed her a dark zip-up bag and asked her to fill it with notes, before asking her to pass it to another teller who did the same.

It is claimed Martinez then took the bag back, walked out of the bank, and drove away in his Honda.

He was arrested just five hours later by police who ran his number plate through a computer, got his driving licence photo and matched it to CCTV from the bank.

Investigators also showed the pictures to the bank tellers, who confirmed it was the robber, before tracking Martinez' car to a Ramada Inn less than two miles away on the other side of town.

After being arrested, Martinez told officers that he and his wife had been kicked out of their house three weeks prior and had moved into the hotel at the start of this week.

He told detectives that he had woken up before his wife, left the room without waking her, and then used his car to drive to the bank and rob it.

Martinez said he had been kicked out of his home three weeks before robbing this branch of Wells Fargo and was living in a hotel with his wife. He didn't tell her about the crime, and insisted he had borrowed the cash

When he arrived back at the hotel he said his wife was awake. Deciding not to mention the robbery, he instead told her that he had borrowed the money.

Martinez was booked into Denver jail on investigation of felony robbery involving $20,000 or more, according to the Denver jail website.

Martinez has prior arrests for assault with a deadly weapon, forgery, criminal impersonation, DUI hit and run and resisting arrest, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.
