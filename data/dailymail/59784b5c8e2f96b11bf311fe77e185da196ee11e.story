Toni Kroos has today continued to rule out a move away from Bayern Munich, despite being urged by his former mentor Jupp Heynckes to stay at the club.

Kroos, who has recent months been heavily linked with Manchester United in both England and Germany, is still yet to put pen to paper for a new deal with the reigning European Champions.

Former Bayern coach Heynckes publicly advised Kroos to stay at the club this week. Not only was Heynckes the brains behind Bayern’s treble winning side last season, he was also the man who established Kroos as a star during his loan spell at Bayer Leverkusen several years ago.

Hands off: Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos has refused to rule out leaving the German giants

Contract talks: The German's deal runs out next summer and he has been linked with Man Utd and Arsenal

In an interview in today’s Bild, Kroos was full of praise for his former coach, saying that 'he is the most important coach I have ever worked with. His is one of a few opinions who I value very highly. It was great to hear what he thinks.'

Nonetheless, the midfielder refused to rule out a move, insisting that 'it is my future, and my decision.'

With Kroos’ contract expiring at the end of next season, Bayern are desperate to extend the deal, as they currently risk losing him on a free.

The negotiations reportedly continue to stall over wages, however, and Bayern’s insistence on playing hard ball over details has evoked a great deal of interest from a number of clubs. Not only United, but also Arsenal and the top clubs in Spain have now been linked to the player.

Most in Germany are still confident that Kroos will stay at Bayern, with TZ writing today that 'he would have no reason to leave'. But as Bayern move no closer to extending the deal, and both Arsenal and United likely to be raiding the transfer market in the coming months, the prospect seems increasingly realistic.

Kroos’ relationship with Guardiola has also been called into question this season, with public disagreements filling the sports pages. The player, though, praised his current coach’s preparation for tonight’s crunch Champions League tie with Real Madrid.

'He knows Madrid perfectly, and has advised us well. No one should have any doubts that we will be on our game'.

Tension: Despite Kroos' praise of coach Pep Guardiola, rumours are rife the two don't get on very well

Talent: The 24-year-old midfielder is regarded as one of the top talents across Europe and is in demand
