Given how much money she has made from Fifty Shades of Grey, it’s little surprise she seems rather keen on the colour.

EL James has bought a £2.65million home which looks almost as though it could have been inspired by the title of her bestselling book.

The 1930s detached property in West London is just a stone’s throw from the £350,000 terraced house she and husband Niall have lived in for the past 15 years.

But while their new home may appear 
rather grey from the outside, inside is rather more dazzling – boasting 
six bedrooms, six bathrooms, a stylish loft conversion and an elegant 
conservatory.

It also has an extensive garden and 
gated driveway, and was originally marketed at £3million.

The purchase 
comes after the writer, whose real name is Erika Leonard, earned a 
reported £862,000 a week from sales of her steamy work.

Despite the mother-of-two’s  fortune, one neighbour at her former home said the family was  ‘down to earth and unassuming’.

Former television executive Mrs Leonard, 49, began writing erotic stories in 2009.

She admitted she never expected Fifty 
Shades of Grey to be so successful, planning to carry on working 
full-time and writing on the side.

However, the book and its sequels, 
Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, went on to sell more than 
65million copies worldwide.

She is also reported to have been paid 
£3million for film rights.

The book’s racy plot follows the 
relationship between naive graduate Anastasia Steele and handsome older 
billionaire Christian Grey, who introduces her to sado-masochism and 
bondage.

The author’s publicist was not available to comment on her move.
