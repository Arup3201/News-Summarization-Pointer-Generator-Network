A traffic warden issued a motorist with a parking ticket while he helped his disabled father-in-law stuck on his mobility scooter.

War hero Steve Paddon, 32, temporarily parked on double yellow lines while he helped his father-in-law Mick White, 75, whose mobility scooter had become stuck in a pothole.

While Mr Paddon was busy helping his relative, a parking warden in a council vehicle slowed down and captured Mr Paddon's licence plate with a built-in CCTV camera before driving off.

Mr Paddon, a former corporal in the RAF who completed seven tours of Iraq and three of Afghanistan, was then sent a £75 fine for being illegally parked.

Mr Paddon appealed against the fine but Poole Borough Council has refused to cancel it despite the extenuating circumstances.

Mr Paddon, who now works as an electrician, had been helping his father-in-law who suffers from a painful degenerative illness to pick up some fence posts at a DIY store in Poole, Dorset, when his mobility scooter got stuck in a pothole.

It was at that moment that the council worked filmed the details of the Vauxhall Vivaro on October 20.

Mr Paddon, who spent 12 years in the RAF, said: 'It is shocking. I’m utterly disgusted by it. The fact they slowed down to get the picture shows they would have seen me struggling to help Mick.

'But they decided to press on and issue the ticket regardless. The fact they had the audacity to slow down and do it really annoys me.

'They didn’t think to stop to ask what the situation was or if Mick was ok.

'Disgusted': Steve Paddon, pictured left with his father-in-law Mick White and the parking ticket, appealed to Poole Borough Council but it was rejected

'I would have stopped to help whether I knew Mick or not - but it’s almost like they’re saying you can’t stop to help someone in need - you’ve got to find a parking space first.

'These people are supposed to be helping our community? I don’t think so.

'It does take a human being to take a look at these things and see what’s going on and use some judgement. There is no common sense or compassion.'

Mr White, who served as a medic in the parachute regiment during the Suez Crisis, added: 'I can’t let him pay it - he was doing me a favour. It did upset me though.

'If I’d fallen off my scooter what is someone supposed to do - just drive past?

'That was the annoying part. They just took the photo and that was it, they weren’t interested if I was alright.

'If you become disabled don’t expect anyone to stop and help you. They might get punished for it.'

Jason Benjamin, parking services manager at Poole Borough Council, said: 'Any vehicle parked on a pavement in a road where there are clearly marked no loading or waiting restrictions will automatically receive a penalty charge notice when patrolled by the camera safety car.

'This will also apply to all Blue Badge holders.

'Inconsiderate parking is an issue as it can put pedestrians and other motorists at risk.

'However motorists do have the right to appeal a decision to issue penalty charge notices.'
