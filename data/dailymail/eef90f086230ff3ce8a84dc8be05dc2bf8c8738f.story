John Barnes did get a second chance as a manager in British football. What he didn’t get was a third.

Having tried and failed at an elite club, Celtic — he left after the infamous loss to Inverness Caledonian Thistle — Barnes managed Jamaica and then Tranmere Rovers.

On October 9, 2012, when he was sacked after a run of two wins in 11 matches, Tranmere were 22nd in League One.

Barnes believes black managers don’t get the second chances afforded their white counterparts, but where could he have gone from there? Nothing in his record suggested he would thrive in the lower leagues, his experience at Celtic will have damaged his appeal to bigger clubs. Barnes was stymied by circumstances, not the colour of his skin.

Jason McAteer, his assistant, has not worked since, either — and neither have three of the four managers subsequently employed and ditched by Rovers.

The experience of Chris Hughton (Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United, Birmingham City, Norwich City, Brighton and Hove Albion), Paul Ince (Macclesfield Town, Milton Keynes Dons, Blackburn Rovers, Notts County, Blackpool) or Keith Curle (Mansfield Town, Chester City, Torquay United, Crystal Palace, Notts County, Carlisle United) supports the theory of the managerial merry-go-round, but suggests that once a black coach is on board, his opportunity is no different from that of a white one.

The problem is getting the elusive first job, not where to go if it doesn’t work out at Tranmere. We know what happens then, black or white.
