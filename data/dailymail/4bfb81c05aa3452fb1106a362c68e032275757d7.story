It is usually the incoming tide that spells the end for sandcastles.

But this 13ft-high fortress, built to mark the 100-day countdown to the Olympics, did not even stand long enough to have the waves lapping at its walls.

Instead, after £5,000 was spent on building the castle over four painstaking days, it was knocked down – over health and safety fears.

No sooner were the requisite publicity photos taken than a mechanical digger demolished it.

Organisers claimed keeping the castle on the beach in Weymouth, Dorset, which will host Olympic sailing events, would have meant hiring 24-hour security staff in case it toppled over and trapped a child or people climbed on it.

But locals described the castle, built by sand sculptor Mark Anderson and funded by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic  Games (Locog), as a waste of time and money.

One likened last Friday’s demolition to a plotline from Twenty Twelve, the BBC’s satire on the preparations for the Olympics, while another said: ‘What a  waste of money – £5,000 for a sandcastle that didn’t stay around for people to see.

Despair: The fort was knocked down almost as soon as it had been completed over fears it could topple onto someone, much to the anger of local residents and businesses, who branded it a waste of time and money

‘If it was dangerous then why build it in the first place?’

A Locog spokesman said the decision 
to destroy the sandcastle was made jointly by Locog, the local council 
and Mr Anderson, explaining: ‘The sandcastle was dismantled as a safety 
precaution straight after the photos were taken.

The official motto for the London Olympics will be 'Inspire a Generation!', organisers announced today.

With the Games just 100 days away, the slogan was officially unveiled at a ceremony at Kew Gardens by London organising committee (LOCOG) chairman Lord Coe and chief executive Paul Deighton.

But having had nearly seven years to think of one, some may question whether it is the best they could have come up with.

Speaking at Kew today, Lord Coe (pictured above) said: 'I am delighted to announce the motto Inspire a Generation.

'It is everything we have been saying since we have started this extraordinary journey, not just since we got across the finish line in Singapore.

'It is the heartbeat, the very DNA of this organisation and a rallying cry for the athletes to come to the UK to perform at their very best and inspire the world.

'With 100 days to go to the start of the Games, millions of people are getting ready to do the best work of their lives and welcome the world this summer. Expectations are high and we won't disappoint.'

‘Our aim was to create an iconic photo opportunity for Weymouth and Portland.’

The spokesman added: ‘Already we have
 seen this photograph used by people [and] publications worldwide and it
 has undoubtedly been a successful exercise.’

Mr Anderson completed the impressive project last Friday morning, a few hours before photographers turned up to take pictures.

Within
 minutes of them leaving, a mechanical digger arrived on the beach at 
Weymouth - which will host all the Olympic sailing events - and promptly
 demolished the castle in an hour.

Simon Williams, head of the Weymouth and 
Portland 2012 operations team for Weymouth and Portland Borough Council,
 justified its removal.

He said: 'It was an organisational decision.

'We
 took it down because it was constructed in a special way and we 
couldn’t have just left it there in case it fell on a young child. We 
would have been criticised if that had been the case.'

A council spokesman added: 'It was built to create a photo opportunity to mark 100 days to go to the Olympics.

'To keep it there until the start of the Olympics would have required additional security and presented a health and safety risk in that it was quite a big structure and it could have collapsed with a child playing on the beach near to it.

'It could have been cordoned off but that would have required additional security to make sure there was no risk of people climbing on it.'

Sand artist Mr Anderson said: 'Demolishing it was all part of the plan because there would have been health and safety issues.

'People could have injured themselves on the council’s land so there would be no way we could leave something like that.'

The castle was paid for by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), which is privately funded.

Locals today slammed the decision to demolish the castle. One resident said: 'If it was dangerous then why build it in the first place?'

Craig Willis, owner of the Wilton 
Guest House, 'It reminds me a bit like the programme Twenty Twelve, 
except this hasn’t been made up.

'It was a great piece of work and we all went to see it during its short life. It’s a shame that it has gone.

'It sounds like health and safety has gone a bit over the top but I suppose they have their reasons for demolishing it.'

Georgie
 Rushforth, of the the Lodmoor Premier Inn, said: 'I thought the 
sandcastle was a good idea, I don’t really understand why it was 
demolished.

'It’s a bit over-dramatic and I think health and safety has gone overboard.'

Just as the Weymouth sandcastle was being cleared away, construction of Europe's longest artificial beach was starting to take shape in London.

Greenwich Beach will open near the Olympic venue next month, with an Olympic-size volleyball court and plans for a restaurant and live events stage catering for crowds of up to 5,000.

The site is expected to be used during the Peninsula Festival and for events during the 2012 Olympic Games.

'Value for money': Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt (above) has defended accusations that the Olympics have cost the taxpayer too much

Olympic leaders have defended the public expenditure on London 2012 after 64 per cent of poll respondents said taxpayers had paid too much towards the Games.

Jeremy Hunt, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, pointed out that a majority in the BBC poll - 55 per cent - also rated London 2012 as good value for money.

London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe added the Olympics have provided jobs and investment at a critical time in the economy.

With 100 days to go to the start of the Games, Mr Hunt said: 'The same poll said more than half of the respondents said the Olympics would be good value for money.

'If you ask people if they spent too much on their Christmas shopping just after they have done the big shop just before Christmas Day a lot of people would say yes.

'The right time to ask people if it has been worth it is after we have had the event.'

Lord Coe said he was not surprised by the poll results, but the Games had already paid an economic dividend with between £6billion and £7billion going into the British construction industry and 42,000 people having worked directly or indirectly on the Olympic Park.

He added: 'Jobs have been safeguarded throughout the UK particularly in some very challenged communities

'I’m not particularly surprised (at the poll), it’s understandable given the world we live in - domestically and internationally people are focused on value for money.

'But in the lead-up to the Games and in the long haul of the legacy of the Games I’m confident we will be able to demonstrate far and away that this was a project that - I’m still gratified that well over half the population believe it - this is value for money and there are tangible benefits in their communities.'
