A rugby player who was filmed downing four fish as part of a drinking dare could face jail over animal cruelty charges. 

Paul Wooding poured the minnows into a pint glass with a concoction of wine and spirits as part of the deadly drinking game Neknomination. 

The 33-year-old from Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, was filmed downing the cocktail in a video he later posted to Facebook.

Wooding was charged with two counts of torturing or killing an animal under the Animal Welfare Act after the footage was reported to the RSPCA.

He could face six months imprisonment when sentenced at Herefordshire Magistrates' Court tomorrow. 

The rugby player explains what is going into the pint glass at the beginning of the video taken in February. 

After pouring measures of vodka, gin, rum, white wine and lemonade into the glass, he introduces his 'special little treats' - four live fish. 

With the creatures still swimming in the liquid, Wooding downs the drink to the amusement of friends in a pub.

The rugby player for Ross-on-Wye RFC could face six months in prison when sentenced tomorrow 

Before swallowing the gruesome drink, he says: 'It ain't big and it ain't clever.' 

After being reported to the RSCPA, the sportsman expressed his fury on Facebook. 

In a post written after the video, he said: 'Some people’s lives must be that sad and boring to get any excitement they had to report me to the RSPCA.' 

A spokesman for the charity said: 'We were called in to investigate after the video was brought to our attention.

'Four fish died as a result of his game and we hope that justice will be done in court.' 

Wooding is the latest to take part in Neknominate - a controversial drinking game which sees participants go to extreme lengths to down alcohol before nominating friends via social media to do one better. 

So far the game has claimed three British lives and sent scores of others to hospital.
