Police in China have recruited a retired basketball player to work as a traffic cop - because his commanding size gets the attention of errant motorists.

At 7ft 6in tall, Chu Yu is China's tallest police officer and something of a novelty on the streets of Dalian, a city in northeast China’s Liaoning province.

Aged 25, he was a former basketball player who quit after numerous injuries and found himself looking for a job.

Chu Yu, 25, had a promising career in basketball ended by injuries, but has now got a job as a traffic cop because his 7ft 6in height means he can easily be seen by drivers

After pictures of Yu were posted online, fans now come up to him in the street and ask for autographs

After a stint at college he was approached by the local police academy and asked if he wanted to become an officer.

'With a stature such as yours, you will command nothing but respect,' the local police chief told him.

Chu said: 'I find that my height is an advantage in this job. Nobody wants to mess with me and when I am on duty, directing busy traffic at intersections, everyone can see me from a long way off so there is never any confusion.

'The department likes to place tall guys like me on traffic duty precisely because we are more likely to be noticed by motorists in traffic.

The other officers in China's northwest Liaoning province have nicknamed Yu 'Beanpole'

When he was approached for the job, the local police chief told him: 'With a stature such as yours, you will command nothing but respect'

'But I am the tallest one of them all - they call me Beanpole at the station!

'Pedestrians also see me, so I am often asked the way. I like it - it's what being a policeman in the community is all about.'

Photos of him directing traffic have gone viral in the country and people have even begun approaching him for his autograph - which he signs Beanpole.
