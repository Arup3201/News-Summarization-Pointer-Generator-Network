The Australian fitness industry has been steadily ballooning over recent years.

With over 3000 gyms keeping more than 17,000 people employed, the industry now generates over a billion dollars a year.

With such a surge in popularity, there are now a multitude of training styles graining traction across the country. 

Daily Mail Australia takes a look at what's in store for the year ahead, from a flood in MMA to an upswing in Hot Yoga.  

Reconditioning

Reconditioning programs are designed to return your body to optimal condition and capability by restoring and reconditioning the natural movement patterns

As gym goers look to balance the stresses of training and lifestyle habits, reconditioning allows them to attain a much-needed recharge.

These unique movement based programs are designed to return your body to optimal condition and capability by restoring and reconditioning the natural movement patterns and functionality of the body to unlock optimum performance and assist in injury prevention and recovery.

'People are realising that you can't thrash your body every time you train. Things are going to start to hurt. Reconditioning improves performance and helps reduce pain and dysfunction and we are already seeing a rise in demand for these styles of classes at Fitness First,' said Mr Cunico.

Mixed Martial Arts Workouts

MMA workouts are an intense blend of cardio and strength based exercises combined with elements of shadow boxing, kicking and ground drills

In light of the growth of intense workouts in 2014, it's no wonder that MMA workouts are set to take centre stage in 2015.

They are an intense blend of cardio and strength based exercises combined with elements of shadow boxing, kicking and ground drills aimed at building both physical and mental strength.

'MMA is growing in popularity due to the rise in UFC and the status of those fighters, but it is also offering those who may have grown tired of traditional cardio workouts like Cycle, a high intensity alternative that will help improve endurance and athleticism,' said Mr Cunico.

Hot Yoga

Hot Yoga takes place in a 35 degree room, which allows for increased mobility and flexibility

This variation of conventional yoga takes place in a heated room that is set to around 35 degrees with the heat warming the muscles and connective tissue allowing for increased mobility and flexibility.

'Hot yoga has been popular with men and first time yogis, those who don't feel yoga is enough of a workout. There is a mentality amongst some gym goers that you're not working hard enough unless you sweat.

Women's Strength Training

Women's Strength Training grows as women accept a new, more muscular look in fitness

While strength training is typically viewed as a man's domain, 2015 is set to being a upswing in women adopting strength training programs.

'Women are more open to trying new things these days and they are starting to see a different, leaner and more muscular physique on other women and accepting this to be the new look of fitness,' said Mr Cunico.
