A Pennsylvania high school football coach could be headed to jail after he shoved a student who allegedly farted in his face.

Michael Smith, 45, also a teacher at Juniata Valley High School in Alexandria, just southwest of State College, was suspended following the March 25 incident. He has been charged with harassment and criminal mischief.

State police say he shoved the student so hard into the wall, the force broke a thermostat.
