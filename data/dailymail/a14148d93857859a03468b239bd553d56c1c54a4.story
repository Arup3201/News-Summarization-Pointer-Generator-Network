Harry Redknapp should be given time to sort out QPR's troubles in the Premier League, according to Hoops' defender Rio Ferdinand.

The west London side are languishing at the bottom of the table and rumours have surfaced about Redknapp's future at the club.

The 67-year-old is yet to pen a new contract, but Ferdinand says it would be crazy for owner Tony Fernandes to push the 'panic button' so early on in the season.

'We are not even in double figures for the amount of games played yet. To push the panic button now would be crazy in my eyes,' Ferdinand, who signed for QPR this season, told the Evening Standard.

'He wants to get the club out of this situation we're in. It's not for the lack of trying.'

Ferdinand also admitted he didn't want Redknapp to be destined for the same fate as his manager last season David Moyes.

Redknapp worked with the 35-year-old when he was a youngster at West Ham. 

'No one wants to see their manager get sacked. It was not nice to see it happen to David Moyes at Manchester United last season and I wouldn't want to see it here. It's down to us as players, as well as the coaching staff, to start turning results around.'
