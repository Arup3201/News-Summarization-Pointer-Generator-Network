Shocking: The spike missed Josh's heart by a mere two inches when he was impaled on the fence near his home in Essex

These shocking pictures show how a schoolboy cheated death after a metal fence spike pierced his chest - missing his heart by two-and-a-half inches.

Josh Hassan, 12, was leaning over the railing near his home in Ilford, London, to look for his football when he lost his footing and became impaled on the fence.

His horrified mother was helped by neighbours to support his body to stop the blade doing further damage as they waited for the emergency services to arrive and cut him free.

Dawn Hassan told of her horror at discovering her son 'hanging' from the fence after being alerted by his screams.

'It took three of us to hold him up so the spike didn't 
do any more damage,' she said.

'But Josh was so brave. He didn't cry once. He was a 
right little soldier.'

The mother-of-two, 30, said waiting for paramedics and firefighters to cut her son free from the fence 'felt like an eternity'.

Josh was rushed to hospital with the blade still piercing his chest, and doctors later told the family the spike had missed his heart by less than three inches.

A photograph of Josh's injury and an X-ray scan showing the enormous spike in his chest reveal the extent of his lucky escape.

Scarred: Josh at home with his mother Dawn Hassan

The schoolboy had been playing 
outside when he kicked his football over the spiked metal gate 
around the corner from his house.

Leaning over the fence to see how far
the ball had gone, Josh slipped and was speared by the steel shaft 
which pierced his flesh.

His mother said: 'He's the kind of child who's more worried about everybody else than what's happening to him.

Lucky to be alive: Joshua was taken to hospital with the spear from the fence still jutting through his chest - as seen in this X-ray image

'Brave': Josh's mother raced outside to find her son impaled on the railings when she was alerted by the sound of him screaming

Terror: Josh's mother Dawn said waiting for firefighters and paramedics to free her son felt 'like an eternity'

'I can't thank the people who helped him enough. They're our heroes. If it wasn't for them Josh might not be here now.

'The doctors said the spike was only two and a half inches away from his heart,' she went on.

'I
still can't believe he climbed over the fence in the first place. He's 
not a daring child. He was just seeing where his ball went.

'And for that to happen - he won't be climbing over any fences in the future,' she added.

Josh was rushed to the Royal Free Hospital following the incident on Tuesday and immediately operated on by surgeons.

Julie Spalding, 43, a mother-of-three
who lives close to where the accident happened, said her daughter 
Amber, 13, who had also been playing outside when Josh was impaled on 
the fence, dashed into the house calling for help.

'My son Chris rushed out,' she said. 'Josh was screaming. He was in so much pain.

Support: Chris Spalding, 22, was among those to come to Josh's aid by supporting the weight of his body as he dangled from the fence

'The spike on the top of the gate had gone in just under his left nipple and came out the same side.

'Chris held Josh to support him so he
didn’t fall down further onto the spike while we waited for the fire 
brigade to get there,' Ms Spalding added.

'Josh’s parents Dawn and Darren came running down to the gate.

'They were absolutely beside themselves.
It took ages to get him free.

'The firefighters had to cut the metal 
railings and then Josh went to hospital with the spike still inside him.

'It was such a gruesome sight,' Ms Spalding said.

'The railing came so close to his heart and lungs, Josh is seriously lucky to be alive.'

Neighbours say this is the second time a child has been impaled on the same fence.

Two years ago a 14-year-old boy got 
his arm caught on a spike, but because it is private housing nobody has 
taken responsibility for it, they say.

Ms
Hassan said: 'I'm disappointed nothing was done about it before but 
even if it means I have to go out there with an angle grinder myself I 
will.

'I couldn't live with myself if it happened to another child and what if its not a near miss next time.'

Josh said he was 'doing fine' but is in a lot of pain, adding that it hurts to sneeze, cough or giggle.

'I've told my little brother Logan to stop making me laugh,' he said.

He has decided to keep the spike which went through his chest as a souvenir.
