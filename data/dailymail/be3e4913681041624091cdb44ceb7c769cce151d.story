A Maine mother of twin girls who were brutally assaulted while in the care of her live-in boyfriend says she may never know what happened the night they were injured.

Emily Walker left her twin two-year-old daughters and her four-year-old son in the care of David Devine, 25, while she worked on May 11.

When she arrived at the mobile home the family shared in Oakland, she found all three children much too quiet.

Vicious beating: Police say David Devine caused serious injuries to twin daughters of his girlfriend, including broken arms and legs, shattered elbows and internal injuries

Brooklyn was lying silently on a couch and Maddilyn was on a bean bag chair.

'She was almost unconscious,' Walker told the Press Herald. 'I touched her arm and I knew right there that it was broken.'

Maddilyn's arm was broken, and Brooklyn had suffered a broken leg, internal bruising and a shattered elbow.

Both girls were bleeding heavily from the nose, reports the Online Sentinel, and Maddilyn was dazed and having trouble breathing.

'It’s probably going to be a mystery that will always bother me for the rest of my life, unfortunately,' Walker told KJ Online. 'No one’s going to get exactly what happened.'

Devine told Walker that her son 
Wyatt had caused the injuries by hitting the little girls with a plastic
 toy bat outside the home.

She relayed the information to the dispatcher but even as she spoke she began to doubt the veracity of Devine's story.

'It just didn’t add up,' she told the Press Herald. 'His story started to change and the time frames were off.'

Healing: Emily Walker with her two-year-old twins Maddilyn and Brooklyn who were badly injured on May 11 and her four-year-old son Wyatt, who her boyfriend said caused the injuries

The Press Herald reports that investigators found a small bloody handprint on the inside of a closet wall, blood smears on a dresser in the girls’ room, 'blood splatter marks on the wall in the hallway' and more blood near a window inside the home.

Police said the nature of the little girls' injuries was so severe that a four-year-old could not have caused them.

Twelve days after the attacks, Devine was arrested and charged with assault.

He and Walker had planned to marry, and she is pregnant with his child.

Walker says he had never been violent or angry with the children before in her presence and he was planning to adopt the children as his own after their marriage.

Defenseless: Little Brooklyn wears an ankle-to-waist cast as well as an arm cast and will have to undergo physical therapy to learn to walk again

'It took me a long time to get used to the idea that he did this,' she told KJ Online. 'In my heart I want to believe it wasn’t him, but I can see that it’s a lie.'

The girls are now in the process of a long and painful recovery. Brooklyn has been placed in a cast that extends from her waist to her ankle, as well as a cast on her arm. She is effectively immobilized and will need to learn to walk again with physical therapy.

'She cries in pain for an hour at a time,' Walker said.

All three children bear emotional scars that will take longer to heal than the broken bones and internal injuries.

Walker says her son Wyatt told her he should have stopped the attack but he was too scared.

Devine is being held in lieu of $50,000 bail.
