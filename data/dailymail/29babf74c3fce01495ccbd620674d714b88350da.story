Anti-terror officers have arrested a suspect terrorist at an undisclosed Australian airport, the Prime Minister has announced.

It is understood a man was planning to depart Melbourne airport for Lebanon but there has been no confirmation at this time.

Just a day after announcing a raft of new measures to counter home-grown terrorists, Tony Abbott told Parliament this afternoon that a new airport-based counter-terrorism squad has intercepted a suspect.

The news comes as The New York Times reports Australia may support a potential US military mission to bomb ISIS targets in Syria.

Mr Abbott made the announcement in Parliament this afternoon.

Mr Abbott said the new Australian Customs and Border Protection counter-terrorism units have been put in place at Sydney and Melbourne international airports and the program is set to expanded.

'I'm advised these new units have already intercepted at least one person of interest,' Mr Abbott told Parliament.

'This government will do everything that is necessary to keep this country safe.'

Similar units will be established at other Australian international airports.

Eventually 80 officers will be stationed at airports to monitor the movements of people on the national security watchlist.

Daily Mail Australia has approached the Prime Minister's office and Customs and Border Protection for further detail.

An estimated 60 Australians are believed to be fighting with extremists in Syria and Iraq. The government believes there are a further 100 'facilitators' in Australia.

Yesterday Mr Abbott announced the government would pour $64 million into measures to 'counter violent extremism and radicalisation'.
