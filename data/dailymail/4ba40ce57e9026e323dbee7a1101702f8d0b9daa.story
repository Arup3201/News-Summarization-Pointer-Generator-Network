Robin van Persie and Phil Neville let their sons train with MAN CITY 

Manchester United striker Robin van Persie's son Shaqueel proves he's a chip off the old block after joining his father in an advertising campaign for BT Sport.

The three-part advert features the Holland international teaching his boy some freestyle tricks on the streets of Manchester before getting involved in a trick off with some deceptively talented locals.

The final part of the series ends in a two-vs-two game where the seven-year-old, unsurprisingly, scores the winning goal before the father and son team head home.

The youngster's talents look set to grace greater stages in the future after being courted by his father's former club Arsenal as a five-year-old before being put on the books of both Manchester clubs.

'He shares my passion of being involved with loads of sports,' said Van Persie Snr last year. 

'His timing is incredible. 

The Manchester United striker shows off some skills of his own after becoming involved in a 2 v 2 game

'He plays for his local team with his friends and he got scouted and now he is playing for both Manchester United and Manchester City.

'In about a year or so he will have to make his mind up.'
