The man accused of killing his girlfriend's mother and stuffing her body in a suitcase allegedly lashed out after the 62-year-old used a racial slur against him.

Tommy Schaefer, 21, is said to have attacked Sheila von Wiese-Mack in their Bali hotel on holiday from Chicago after she used the N-word, Indonesian police say.

The claim came from her mixed-race daughter Heather Mack, 19, who is also being held as a suspect. Neither have been formally charged.

Attack: Police say Schaefer hit Sheila von Wiese-Mack, from Chicago, with the iron handle of a fruit bowl

Schaefer is black, as was Mack's father James L Mack - a highly regarded jazz and classical composer who died in 2006.

According to police detective chief Captain Nengah Sadiarta, Mack told them that Schaefer became angry when von Wiese-Mack - who was white - called him the N-word, and killed her while Mack watched in their hotel room.

When Schaefer brought up her late husband's race, von-Weise-Mack  used the N-word again but added that James Mack was also rich, the 19-year-old allegedly told police.

The badly beaten body of von Wiese-Mack was found stuffed in a suitcase inside the trunk of a taxi at the St. Regis Bali Resort in August.

Sadiarta said police filed their dossiers at the prosecutor's office in Denpasar, the capital of Bali, on Monday but are continuing to investigate.

Suspect: Heather Mack, pictured at the police headquarters in Bali, is a suspect but not formally charged 

Details: Mack confessed to police that Schaefer beat her mother but did not say if it was intended for murder 

Family: Heather and Sheila, from Chicago, were on holiday together on the Indonesian island 

Raja Nasution, an Indonesian lawyer for Mack, said he and her U.S. lawyer accompanied her during questioning. He confirmed the police account of the racial slur being used, but added that Mack did not specifically say she saw Schaefer kill her mother.

'She did not mention murder, but she told investigators that Tommy did the beating,' Nasution said. 

'Our client did not mention that the beating was intended to kill her mother or not. She just confessed to the police that Tommy beat her mother.'

Nasution also said Mack told police she did not kill von Wiese-Mack or help stuff her body into the suitcase.

Haposan Sihombing, a lawyer who has represented Schaefer, said Friday that he could not comment because Schaefer replaced him a day earlier. He refused to give the name of Schaefer's new lawyer.

Sihombing, however, denied that Schaefer had confessed to killing von Wiese-Mack, as Denpasar's police chief, Col. Djoko Hari Utomo, said last month. Utomo has since said he intended to say that Mack told police that Schaefer was responsible.

Scene: Police laid out pieces of evidence in the parking lot including bloodied sheets and pillows from the room 

Killed: von Wiese-Mack's body was found in the suitcase at the luxury resort in Indonesia in August

Sadiarta said the hotel's surveillance camera video shows that Schaefer took a piece of iron from his room and hid it under his shirt as he went to von Wiese-Mack's room. 

He said the iron appeared to be the grip of a fruit bowl provided by the hotel in his room, and investigators found bits of iron matching the piece in the victim's wound.

The captain said the surveillance video shows that no one but Mack and Schaefer went in and out of von Wiese-Mack's room in the hours surrounding her death. He said Mack was seen in the video bringing a cart to von Wiese-Mack's room to transport the suitcase that contained her mother's body.

Police have said that Mack and Schaefer hired a taxi, placed the suitcase in its trunk and disappeared. Hotel staff noticed spots of blood on the suitcase and told the driver to go to a police station, where officers opened the suitcase and discovered the body.

Sadiarta also said police found a jacket belonging to Schaefer with blood spots when police caught him at another Bali hotel. Lab results showed that the blood matched von Wiese-Mack's blood.
