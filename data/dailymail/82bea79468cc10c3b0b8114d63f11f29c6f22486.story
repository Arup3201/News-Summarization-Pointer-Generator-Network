Taking on the challenge of playing Princess Diana in a film released this month was not a role Naomi Watts took lightly.

Her personal trainer has revealed how the actress, 44, undertook on a gruelling workout regime in order to transform herself into the late princess.    

New York-based fitness guru Simone De La Rue told Health & Fitness magazine how she got the mother-of-two into shape using her tried and tested methods of resistance training combined with danced-based cardio. 

New body: Naomi Watts has been working out with her trainer Simone De La Rue, who uses an intense dancer-like workout regime to get her clients in shape

The trainer, who also counts Sandra Bullock, Matt Damon and Anne Hathaway as her clients, is famed for her tough yet effective dance work-outs.

She explained how she works with clients like Naomi for three months to achieve the best results.

The ex-professional dancer said: 'When working towards a specific goal with a client, I encourage them to train five or more times a week, for one hour a day.'

Dancer body: Simone, a former  professional dancer, said that Naomi did a great deal of cardio work for her role as Diana

'I set a programme that constantly challenges my clients and, during the last three weeks, we really increase the intensity.'

Simone added that for her role as Diana, Naomi carried out a great deal of cardio work but the dance element makes it 'a fun way to get your sweat on and burn calories.'

Simone, 38, who is originally from Australia, says her core-strengthening sessions, which incorporate pilates, yoga 
and dance, have become a favourite with celebrities because they deliver 'long and lean' results.

Speaking to MailOnline last year, she explained how the technique, originally developed to keep her dancer's body fit and free from injury, is successful because it varies different kinds of exercise.

And even though she works with many VIPs, Ms De La Rue encourages her celebrity clients 'to leave their egos at the door'.

Big role: Naomi's starring role as Diana in the new movie is her biggest to date, so it is no wonder she wanted to look her best

A-list clientele: The trainer also counts Anne Hathaway and Sandra Bullock as her clients and is famed for her gruelling yet effective dance work-out regimes

She said: 'I think actors also connect with what I do because I encourage them to be creative. It’s a release.'

One of her most famous clients is Sandra
Bullock, who turned to the BBS workouts after she split from husband 
Jesse James in 2011.

The trainer revealed: 'Sandy
wanted to focus on her upper arms so we used wrist weights and slowly 
moved the arms in a move that mimics the "Port De Bras."'

A personal session at her studio Body By Simone studio in New 
York would set you back around £111 ($175), but group sessions cost a more reasonable £22 ($35).

'You don’t have to be a millionaire to work out properly,' she added.
