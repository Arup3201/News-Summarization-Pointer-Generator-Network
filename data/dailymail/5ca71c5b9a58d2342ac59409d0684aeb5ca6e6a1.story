It will certainly get a lot tougher for Grigor Dimitrov from here. The Bulgarian did not have to perform at anywhere near his peak level to get past Leonardo Mayer 6-4, 7-6, 6-2 but now comes Britain’s No 1.

Andy Murray and Dimitrov will meet in a quarter-final match that shone out when the draw was made before this tournament started: the king of grass versus the emerging prince.

We can only hope the sun will be shining because it was clear the rain interruptions and gloomy weather made this third-round match a less-than-pleasing spectacle.

There were more shanks and slips than shots of awe as the Queen’s champion failed to really get into his groove.

He
 took the first set comfortably enough and the second was poised at 6-5 
when the covers came on. Around one hour and 45 minutes later the 
players re-emerged and soon after Dimitrov was claiming the set with a 
fortunate half-volley.

But
 Mayer challenged and found a second chance through Hawk-Eye showing the
 ball drifting just wide. He chucked away his reprieve with a double 
fault to hand a 2-0 lead to Dimitrov.

The
 final set was equally error-strewn but the 11th seed was able to come 
through on the big points and twice broke the Argentinian.

Serving
 for the match Dimitrov recovered from 30-0 down to take the next four 
points and step into the last eight here for the first time in his 
career.

‘Today
 is extremely tough to play on court,’ he said. ‘It’s pretty slippery, 
the weather hasn’t been very pleasant. I’m happy I finished in three 
sets and can get a good day off.

‘It
 was pretty tricky, my movement was pretty good but there were a few 
spots that were slippery, the ball wasn’t jumping properly. You just 
have to take it.

‘(During
 the break) I had time to grab a bit of food, rest a little bit and see 
what I can do better when I come back to court. You get to chat with 
your coach.

‘My
 quarter final match is something I’ve been waiting for a very long 
time, the work I’ve put in really shows up. I’m excited for another 
match.’
