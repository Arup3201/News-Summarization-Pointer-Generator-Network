Gary Johnson claimed that Yeovil could fill a 100,000-seater stadium for the visit of Manchester United after his side scored two late goals to beat Accrington Stanley.

The Yeovil manager walked in with a bottle of beer and took a huge swig before basking in the glory of a win which set up a dream FA Cup third round tie.

Yeovil's Huish Park was awash with nerves and slips and slides until the final five minutes when Simon Gillett volleyed in from 20 yards and substitute Kieffer Moore headed in to seal the win.

This will now be the venue that Louis Van Gaal brings Wayne Rooney and Co in one of the mouthwatering ties of the next round.

'If we had a ground which could hold 100,000 we'd have 100,000 on the day,' Johnson said. 'But it only holds a 10th of that, so hopefully all who want tickets will get them. There is no greater prize, it's a game against probably the world's biggest team.'

The victory will earn Yeovil an extra £250,000 in prize and TV money – but they had to earn it. This turned into a proper cup tie, tense and tight, as the heavy rain, which begun before kick off, turned the second half more to chance with players slipping and sliding. Shirts and shorts turned brown with mud as the two teams battled, knowing what was at stake.

Accrington Stanley's chance to win it came in the 69th minute when Seamus McCarten hit the bar with a 20-yard shot, which came back out to MattCrooks only two yards out, but with goalkeeper Jed Steer on the floor he headed wide.

Johnson added: 'Although the quality was not there both teams gave everything, tackles were flying in. It made for a scrappy game. The important thing was the result.

'Playing United will be the highlight of their career for most of our players. We're not under pressure to beat Manchester United, but it's massive. I didn't want to talk about the finances but it's huge for a club like ours. We can't sell player for a quarter or half a million. If the FA Cup draw is good that's the only other way to get it. We've got it. I'm sure the directors are smiling with their glasses of wine.'

The added pressure on both teams – that thought of facing Manchester United in the next round – weighed heavy and was felt in every slightly over-hit shot. Every chance on goal and defensive slip was a hero and villain waiting to happen.

Then both materialised with five minutes remaining. Accrington goalkeeper Rose punched weakly straight to Gillett who hit the ball first-time and into the wide open left of goal. The game was put beyond reach with Kieffer's last-minute header.

Accrington Stanley manager John Coleman wants revenge by winning promotion from League Two and taking Yeovil's place in the league above. 'You got the feeling it's not going to be your night when you hit the underside of the bar,' he said. 'It's very small margins. I don't think anybody can argue we weren't the better side in both legs, but sometimes you don't get what you deserve.

'I hope Yeovil enjoy their moment, but I want to take their place in League One and that will be the bigger prize for us.'
