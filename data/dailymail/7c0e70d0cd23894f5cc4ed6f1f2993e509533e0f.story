Scientists are predicting an 'explosion' of flea activity in UK homes over the next few week. A magnified cat flea is pictured

Are you sitting comfortably? If you have a pet, that might be about to change.

Scientists from the British Pest Control Association are predicting an ‘explosion’ of flea activity in UK homes over the next few weeks, as the temperature and humidity rates are set to reach the ideal climate for fleas to awaken and breed.

Milder winters in recent years have seen the flea population swell, which means that infestations are seen on a larger scale than before.

Homes with pets that either have fleas, or have not been treated as a precaution, are the most at risk.

‘Pet owners should be warned that these overwintered parasites may spring out of their dormant state during the warmer temperatures in July,’ said Richard Moseley of the British Pest Control Association.

‘Milder winter temperatures have seen flea populations rise over recent years, meaning that the risk of infestation will only increase in the warmer months.

‘They can thrive in our soft furnishings and carpets as larvae and eggs and have the potential to remain dormant as pupae for a long time. It just takes a few fleas left unchecked to turn into a full blown flea infestation,’ he warned.

Famed primarily for their itchy bites, fleas can transmit diseases, some of which can affect humans. Pets and owners can suffer severe allergic reactions to flea saliva, resulting in dermatitis, too.

Infestations of the parasite may become an annual event due to wetter summers and milder winters.

‘Once a home is infested, it can be difficult to treat and a quick vacuum won’t eradicate the problem,’ Moseley added.

Putting her eggs in one sofa: The project revealed that a single female flea will lay up to 50 eggs per day and around 500 during her lifespan, so within two months, she could hypothetically generate more offspring than the number of humans on this planet - around 7.152 billion

'Pet owners should be warned that these overwintered parasites may spring out of their dormant state during the warmer temperatures in July,' said Richard Moseley of the British Pest Control Association. A stock image of a cat scratching is pictured. One flea can bite a pet up to 400 times a day

Fleas can jump 13 inches (34cm) - 160 times their own length, which the equivalent of a human leaping over the Eiffel tower.

They can survive a force of 100Gs.

Fleas mature into adults in just 18 days, which means that under the right conditions, one flea can turn into 125,000 of the parasites within eight weeks.

A single flea will lay approximately 500 eggs in her lifetime.

In nine months, a female fleas can hypothetically create up to a trillion descendants.

Adult fleas can survive up to 62 days without a blood meal.

They drink up to 15 times their body weight in a single day - which is why pets with lots of fleas can be anaemic.

Around 95 per cent of the flea population exists in immature stages in sofas and carpets etc.

They can carry and spread sickness and diseases to pets and people including typhus and bubonic plague.

A single flea can bite a pet - or a person - up to 400 times a day.

There are over 2,000 different species of flea.

'All carpets, furnishings and pet bedding will need to be thoroughly treated and it is vital to ensure that all pets are treated with an effective product - ideally one which will protect both home and pet.’

Flea treatment brand Advantage, investigated the design of the flea, which has survived and thrived for 60 million years.

The creatures can jump 13 inches (34cm) which is 160 times their own length.

This is possible because of the unique structure of a flea’s rear legs, which catapult it to the height required to reach a passing host at speeds reaching 4mph, (6km/h) and subjecting them flea to forces in excess of 100 G’s. 

Their abilities put humans to shame.

British long-jumper Greg Rutherford, who recorded a gold-medal-winning jump of 27 feet (8.31 metres) during the 2012 Olympic Games, jumped just four times his own length, while top top astronauts can withstand a gravitational force of five Gs before passing out.

The project revealed that a single female flea will lay up to 50 eggs per day and around 500 during her lifespan.

This means that within two months, she could hypothetically generate more offspring than the number of humans on this planet - around 7.152 billion.

This is because fleas take just 18 days to reach adulthood and start breeding.

Now that's long jump: Fleas can jump 13 inches (34cm) which is 160 times their own length. This is possible because of the unique structure of a flea's rear legs, which catapult it to height required to reach a passing host at speeds reaching 4.3 miles per hour, (6.9km/h) and subjecting the flea to forces in excess of 100 G's

So while the pests can breed very fast, and can bite a pet up to 400 times a day to drink up to 15 times their own body weight, most 95 per cent of the population exists in immature stages near to pets, such as carpets and furnishings.

'[They are] waiting for the presence of a host to feed on, sensing movement, warmth and even breath of a passing host,’ Advantage said.

‘Resilient fleas inside pupae can remain in this dormant state in the home for a number of months under the right conditions - even surviving vacuuming - with our heated homes allowing the perfect environment for year-round flea activity.’

Armed and potentially dangerous: Famed primarily for their itchy bites, fleas (pictured) can cause more than significant damage, including the transmission of diseases, some of which can affect humans. Pets and owners can suffer severe allergic reactions to flea saliva resulting in dermatitis

Ian Wright, a parasitologist from the European Scientific Counsel Companion Animal Parasites (ESCCAP) UK and Ireland told MailOnline: ‘Even in the winter months, our cosy homes are the ideal breeding ground for the parasite, which means that their numbers will only increase in the warmer months - the key season for fleas.  

‘They can thrive in our soft furnishings and carpets as larvae and eggs and have the potential to remain dormant as pupae for a long time. It just takes a few fleas left unchecked to turn into a full blown flea infestation.’

Presently there are more than 2,000 described species and subspecies of flea across the globe, with the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) being the most prominent species affecting cats and dogs in the UK.
