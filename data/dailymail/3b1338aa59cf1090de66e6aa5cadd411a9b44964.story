Disneyland was on fire Saturday night after a blaze broke out at the It's A Small World ride.

Flames at least ten feet high could be seen leaping at the theme park's original location in Anaheim, California, closing one of its most famous attractions.

Social media was flooded with images of the fire, which began around 9:20pm and is thought to be linked to a nightly fireworks display.

The blaze was mainly confined to a tree in a backstage area near the ride - and was reportedly quashed by Disneyland's firefighting team within half an hour.

No injuries were reported, according to local news station NBCLA.

As of Disneyland's last update, they hoped to have It's A Small World open and playing its iconic theme song again before the park's midnight closing time.

Anaheim's own fire department responded to the fire, but was called off because the Disney firefighters had it under control.
