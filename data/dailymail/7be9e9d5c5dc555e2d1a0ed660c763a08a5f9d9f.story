Horrific: Curtis Echols was a beloved figure in his southeastern Memphis neighborhood. The cancer survivor was dragged to death in a hit and run jjust yards from his home

A 59-year-old cancer survivor beloved by his Memphis neighbors was killed late Saturday when a driver smashed into him on a sidewalk, dragged him through a front yard and left him to die in the street just yards from his home.

Curtis Echols' cane, shoes and feeding tube lay at his side after a Chevy Malibu allegedly driven by 21-year-old Curteria Leuellyn sped away from the grim scene.

The horrifying death leaves a void in the Orange Mound neighborhood that won't soon be filled.

Echols' neighbor Randy Norris had the misfortune of seeing his friend's terrible death.

'A
 loud boom,' Norris told WREG. 'They came through the fence and ended up
 on the sidewalk. They started the car up and took off.'

Norris, like most folks in the area of Orange Mound in southeast Memphis who knew Echols, has been left devastated.

'I hardly got any sleep,' he said. 'He was my best friend. We did everything together. He wasn’t supposed to go like that.'

Echols'
 niece Shalanda Echols felt the irreparable loss, as well, and was most 
struck with the bitter irony of her uncle's surviving throat, tongue and
 prostate cancer 'only to be run over, taken out this way.'

'He went a way that he should not have went and I am really going to miss him,' said Shalanda.

Charged: Curteria Leuellyn, 21, (right) has been charged with crashing through a fence, hitting Echols and dragging him to his death without calling police. Also charged on an unrelated theft count was Tonisha Thompson (left)

In deep: Leuellyn was, who allegedly crashed straight through this fence, is charged with vehicular manslaughter

Wrenching: A trail of debris both physical and emotional was left behind by the Saturday night crash

The
 community where Echols was known as Mayor of Hugenot, the street where 
he lived and died, came together for a candlelight vigil on Sunday.

The
 large crowd was evidence of Echols belovedness as friends and neighbors
 wept over his loss and vowed to hold on to his memory.

They also vowed to find the people or person responsible for their friend's death.

On
 Monday, police hauled in  21-year-old Curteria Leuellyn and charged her
 with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident.

Allegedly riding along with Leuellyn was 19-year-old Tonisha Thompson, who was arrested on unrelated theft charges.

Thompson was due in court Wednesday.

Leuellyn was held in lieu of $30,000 bond and scheduled to appear in court Monday.

Paying tribute: The community where Echols was so beloved gathered Sunday to grieve and pay homage to the man they lovingly referred to as their street's 'mayor' near where he lived and died

Sad: Neighbors held a candlelight vigil for Echols, where friends and loved ones called for justice through tears and remembrances of better times
