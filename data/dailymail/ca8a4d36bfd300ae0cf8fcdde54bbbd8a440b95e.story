Roberto Mancini has parted company with Turkish club Galatasaray.

The Italian had only been in charge for nine months - penning a three-year deal in October - but will leave with a Â£3.2million payoff.

Galatasaray confirmed on Wednesday that Mancini had left the club by mutual consent.

Mutual consent: Roberto Mancini has left Galatasaray after just nine months in charge

Axed: Mancini was sacked by Manchester City in 2013 despite winning the Premier League 12 months earlier

'Our relationship with coach Roberto Mancini and his contract of employment, which was signed on October 1, 2013, has been terminated by mutual agreement,' read a statement on Galatasaray's official website.

'We wholeheartedly thank (Mancini) for his success and achievements and wish him happiness in his next mission.'

Galatasaray finished runners-up in the Turkish top flight and won the Turkish Cup under Mancini's care, while they also reached the last 16 of the Champions League before exiting at the hands of Chelsea.

But a dispute regarding the club's future aims appears to be the reason behind the sudden divorce.

'As a coach I understand the demands of the club,' Mancini told Gazzetta dello Sport.

'However, when I accepted the coaching post, Gala's aims were different.

'In the past eight months, despite enduring a challenging start, I have done my job pushed by passion and by hunger which has resulted in the team qualifying for the Champions League, lifting the Turkish Cup and finishing second in the league.

'It's with sadness that I leave Istanbul and the club's fantastic supporters.'

Mancini, who won the Premier League title with Manchester City in 2012, has been linked with a return to Serie A.
