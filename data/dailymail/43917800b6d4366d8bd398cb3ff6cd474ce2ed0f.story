A woman who suffers from RSI claims she's cured her pain by becoming a mermaid. 

Frankie Dubery, 25, has regained the use of her legs both on land and under the sea after donning a tail and taking to the water.

Cambridge-graduate Frankie suffered severe repetitive strain injury after spending up to 80 hours a week at a desk.

Her mermaid trick has enabled her to battle the debilitating illness where she is now able to walk

As part of her act, Frankie is able to dive to depths of 20 metres and hold her breath for three minutes 

Housebound and miserable Frankie decided to start a company called Merlesque friends Demelza Fox and Mairead Kelly after becoming interested in mermaids.

Now she can hold her breath for nearly three minutes and dive to depths of 20 metres in order to entertain the crowds of thousands the act regularly attracts.

Frankie, from Orpington, Kent, said: 'Being a mermaid is like nothing else - I love it.

'My RSI left me in agony. I would be in pain before I even got out of bed in the morning. I was confined to a wheel chair and could barely leave the house.

'Starting Merlesque has given me my freedom back. RSI is recurring, but I know now that I continue being a mermaid if it does return.'

After spending more than 80 hours a week at a desk, Frankie suffered serious pain in her arms and legs 

Frankie launched her own business Wildfire Productions with three friends after graduating from Cambridge

Frankie studied Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at Cambridge University and graduated in 2010.

During her studies she got into performance art including fire poi and trapeze.

On graduating Frankie decided she wanted to be an entertainer full time but no circuses in Cambridge were recruiting full time staff.

She said: 'It was a difficult economic time and there weren't many jobs available in the industry I wanted so I decided to start my own business, Wildfire Productions.

'I had an office job to support myself financially and was working on the company in my free time, so I was spending eighty hours a week at a desk.

Now Frankie, pictured, has regained use of her legs due to her strenuous fitness regime 

'My wrists and fingers seized up with repetitive strain injury - I was in agony. At the same time, an old injury in my legs got worse until I couldn't walk anymore.

'I couldn't leave the house, let alone carry on with the performance that I loved. Demelza had already researched mermaids and she suggested we give it a go.'

It took over a year for the three women to get their business up and running, and Merlesque Mermaids officially launched last year.

Now Frankie has regained the use of her legs thanks to the exercise being a mermaid provides.

She said: 'The RSI is a recurring injury, so it could come back at any time, but I know that I will always have mermaiding if it does come back.

'It's quickly become my favourite type of performance. It took a lot of research and training but I wouldn't change it for the world.

'I have even been to Thailand to certify as an advanced free-diver to improve my skills. Now I can dive to 20 metres and hold my breath for two minutes 50 seconds.'

The trio now take booking for events across the country, including weddings, birthdays and corporate events, where they swim, sing and perform for the guests.
