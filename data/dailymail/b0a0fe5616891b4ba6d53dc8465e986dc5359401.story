20th century beauty secrets: To enhance their appearance, women in 1907 were advised to cry and wear pearls

Today women have a plethora of cosmetics at their fingers tips to help their eyes appear wider and brighter.

But a delve into the Daily Mail archives has revealed that more than 100 years ago, those who wanted to enhance their appearance had to reply on more basic methods.

A column called 'Little Secrets of Beauty' published in the newspaper in March 1907 advises women to have a good old cry if they want to look good - as long as it's kept short.

The article states: 'Crying will make the eyes brighter provided it is not indulged in for too long. A brisk little cry clears out the tear ducts and makes the eyes clearer, but much of it will take away the brilliancy again.'

In another surprising tip, they warn: 'The woman facing a bright light while she sews or reads will soon have her eyes of no colour at all.' 

The column has other advice for women dependent on their hair and eye colour. 

For women with brown eyes, it's recommended they wear 'brown round her neck and under her chin' to enhance the colour. 

It adds: 'The brown-eyed woman should dress her hair rather fluffily. She must not wear it plain, and should bring it down well upon her forehead.'

Women with blonde hair and brown eyes are in luck as the article states they will look 'charming no matter how she arranges her hair, provided of course that is is well coiffe. It is as well for her to mass her hair high above her forehead so that it will make an aureole for her face.'

But the writer laments: 'It is the woman with dull or fishy eyes who is at a loss how to proceed because her eyes lack colour.'

Scrubbing up well: Pale-eyed girls were advised to 'treat her eyebrows every night with a good eyebrow grower' and bath their eye lashes with a little boracic acid in water

For such women, they offer the following advice: 'Do not make "play" with your eyes. It is the pale-eyed girl who loves to cast her eyes upwards looking at nothing at all. It is the girl with the pale blue eyes who rolls them and strikes attitudes. 

'But be it remembered that while the black-eyed girl may attempt such "play" the pale-eyed one never should do so.'

They recommend that the 'pale-eyed girl should treat her eyebrows every night with a good eyebrow grower in the form of a little almond oil and vaseline mixed half and half. In the morning, the eyebrows should be brushed with a little soft bay toothbrush.'

Meanwhile, they also advise bathing eye lashes with warm water with a hint of boracic acid dissolved in it. 

Last resort: Pale eyed girls could always wear a hat but shouldn't make 'play' with their eyes in order to look more attractive 

This eye wash is often only used in the modern day to treat the symptoms of conjunctivitis but back in 1907, it was said to keep eye lashes 'well and strong'.

If all else fails for the 'pale-eyed girl' then the 20th century beauty columnist recommends she 'wears a hat that tips forward over her face so that the brim may shade her eyes'.

When it comes to accessorising, in 1907 diamonds were not a girls' best friend. Instead, pearls were more in fashion according to the beauty column as they are 'softer and vastly more welcoming than diamonds'.

Under a sub heading 'crimes against beauty' the writer warns about the causes of premature ageing, some of which remain in vogue today. For example, they state that 'the woman who looks intently at things will soon develop a wrinkle between the eyes' and sleeping with the face in the pillow can lead to 'waking up with a thousand wrinkles'.

Times may have changed but beauty writers today still advise against squinting as it can cause lines around the eyes and recommend a silk or satin pillow to prevent wrinkles.
