Thanks to an animal charity, Elsa, a six-year-old lioness, has been rescued from San Martin Circus in Sardinia, Italy, and given a new life.

The charity Born Free took action after seeing the lioness forced to perform demeaning and unnatural tricks to entertain the public.

Today Elsa and all the other animals at the Italian circus have been formally seized by the Italian government after it was discovered that the circus’s conditions do not meet legal requirements and safety regulations.

Fortunately, Elsa is relatively healthy and, if anything, is a little over-weight. She was bred at another Italian circus and then left dumped at San Martin when she couldn’t be trained. Her brother was born deformed and died.

Elsa has been removed to a temporary home on the Italian mainland. There she will be examined and if healthy to travel and permission is received from the Italian authorities she will be driven to Olbia port.

From there she will be taken to Born Free's rescue centre in South Africa where she can live out her days at a three-acre enclosure, with trees and bushes, sandy soil to roll in and dense undergrowth to explore.

If you would like to find out more about their work, go to the Born Free Foundation website or call 01403 240170.

Easy does it: After years in captivity, Elsa is naturally wary of being moved out of her comfort zone at the zoo by strangers
