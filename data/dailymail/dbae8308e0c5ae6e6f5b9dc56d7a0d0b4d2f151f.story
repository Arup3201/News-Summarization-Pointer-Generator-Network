LIKE James Bond, Sir Roger Moore has at times enjoyed a martini. But the actor has revealed he can no longer drink the cocktail because of his Type 2 diabetes.

Sir Roger, 86, was diagnosed with the condition last year, and it means he has to watch the amount of sugar and alcohol he consumes.

A martini is a highly alcoholic cocktail, made from a combination of gin and vermouth. And it was Bond’s drink of choice when Sean Connery played the spy.

Shaken not stirred: Sir Roger Moore, who starred in seven James Bond films, drinks a martini in 1968

Opening up about his health condition, Sir Roger said: ‘I make a very good dry martini but I’m not allowed to drink them any more. No more sugar, no alcohol. I get to taste the wine and I can make a little sip last an hour. I enjoy it much more. I remember a lot more of what happened.’

Typically a martini is a gin-based drink, although it can also be made with vodka.

In the 007 films Bond is known for ordering his martinis ‘shaken not stirred’, referring to the way in which they are made.

The cocktail can also be made ‘with a twist’, which involves lemon peel, or ‘dirty’, where it contains olive brine.

It was Connery’s Bond who drank martinis, Sir Roger explained, first uttering the ‘shaken not stirred’ catchphrase in Goldfinger.

In the past Sir Roger has admitted having a taste for champagne. These days, however, he sticks to soft drinks, claiming his ‘vice’ to be Diet Coke. And he has come up a guilt-free virgin cocktail – a Band Aid – which is a combination of non-alcoholic beer and Diet Coke. ‘No calories and it’s delicious,’ Sir Roger said.

Giving an interview to the Sunday Telegraph the actor, who starred in seven James Bond films, went on to joke that he would indulge in martinis and ice cream if he knew he only had one day left to live.

He said: ‘When I’m told I’ve got 24 hours to go, I’m going to have a couple of dry martinis with Tanqueray gin - not vodka - and a couple of choc ices with plain chocolate on the outside and white, white vanilla on the inside - oh, and baked beans.’

Sir Roger, who last appeared as 007 almost 30 years ago, revealed he had been diagnosed with diabetes last year.

He had collapsed at home in Monaco and been rushed into hospital by his fourth wife Kristina Tholstrup.

Doctors confirmed that the star, who had been losing weight for some time, was suffering from the condition.

Appearing on US TV’s Late Show with David Letterman ‘I went to the doctor, and he said, “You know those high blood-sugar numbers you’ve been dealing with since you were 36? Well, you’ve graduated! You’ve got Type 2 diabetes, young man”.’

In the past Sir Roger has survived prostate cancer and had a pacemaker inserted.
