This randy couple obviously couldn't wait to get home when they decided to have sex in a car while cruising down a state highway.

A sensible driver would never have taken his hands off the wheel or eyes off the road but this motorist manages to keep control of the car despite being otherwise pre-occupied with his female passenger. 

The excitable pair were caught on camera in their mini-van by another couple driving beside them along the Eisenhower expressway, west of Chicago.

Despite realising they are being filmed, the couple carry-on without a care in the world. 

The female driver of the other car can be heard telling her reluctant cameraman to make sure he has 'got the shot'.

'I want to get her bouncing again,' she says. 

But her hesitant passenger who is filming the act on his mobile phone says: 'I'm not looking.

'I have got the shot. I'm not looking. I'm done.'

The couple may want to think twice next time before getting their kicks on the highway.

Only in May this year a man from New Mexico faced multiple charges after police said he was having sex with a woman while driving but crashed ejecting his naked lover out the front window.

Luis Briones, 25, was found with one shoe on and his shorts on inside out in Albuquerque.

The woman, who survived, was found with no clothes on lying on the pavement after being thrown from the car.

The pair may also want to familiarise 
themselves with the Click It or Ticket campaign - a national drive to 
get young people using seat-belts in the U.S.
