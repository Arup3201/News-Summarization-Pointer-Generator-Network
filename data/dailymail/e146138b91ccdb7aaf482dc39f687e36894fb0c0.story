Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini found the perfect answer to his critics after firing in a spectacular equaliser at The Hawthorns after just three minutes on the pitch.

The much maligned Belgium midfielder received strict orders from Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal on the bench during the first-half.

Van Gaal then ordered the 26-year-old to warm up on his own during the break before replacing Ander Herrera with Fellaini.

Fellaini soon took note of Van Gaal's directions as the rest of the United squad look on at the Hawthorns 

After the match, van Gaal admitted he knew he'd call upon Fellaini to turn fortunes around.

'(I knew) after 30 minutes. And then I said (to Fellaini) to look what Herrera is doing because I want you to play,' said van Gaal.

West Brom's official Twitter account tweeted a teasing update at half-time saying 'Fellaini has now taken his tracksuit off, fortunately he has a Man Utd strip on underneath #WBAMUN'. However Fellaini proved his worth immediately.

Within three minutes of the restart he won an aerial battle with Joleon Lescott on the edge of West Brom's area, set the ball up wide on the right, and fired in an unstoppable drive in to the top right corner past Boaz Myhill.

Remarkably that was Fellaini's first goal for United since signing last September and the Belgian was delighted, 'It was a great feeling. I've waited a long time for this moment,' he said after the match.

West Brom later insisted that the intention of the tweet was to make a Carry On-style gag about Fellaini 'stripping off' but instead of being naked under his tracksuit top, he had a United shirt on. Albion say it was not meant to be a put-down.

That joke was probably not worth the effort, in hindsight.
