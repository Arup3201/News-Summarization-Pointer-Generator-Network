The ladies of Essex (and certain men - yes you, Joey) have long championed a glowing tan.

But new research by Chloe Sims' tanning brand has revealed that British women are so desperate to get a sun tan they dedicate over a year of their lives to baking their skin.

On the back of this, Chloe Sims has posed in a new campaign wearing nothing but a thong and a fake golden glow to showcase the power of a bottle tan.

Chloe, who is the face of her own Montana Tan's Starship Range, spoke out about the shocking new suntanning stats: 'I'm
 in shock that women are still spending so much time on sunbeds and in 
the sun damaging their skin and putting their health at risk too.'

According to Chloe's research, it seems that we are a nation of copy-Kim's with the Kardashian being crowned as the nation's tanning idol with 35 per cent of votes.

The reality TV star and Vogue cover girl was closely followed by Cheryl Cole (25 per cent), while Helen Flanagan was voted as having the worst tan.

According to the research, there is some confusion as to whether Katie Price is a bronze 
goddess or a tanning disaster as she was voted third best and 
second worst celebrity tan.

The results show that women aren't 
turning their back on the fake stuff either with over 70 per cent of the
 women questioned claiming that they still use self-tan on a regular 
basis - and the majority apply it at least once a week.

And the reason? The poll revealed that women believe that fake tan can help them get a job and even a boyfriend.
