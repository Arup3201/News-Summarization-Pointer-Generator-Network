Michael Clarke fought through the pain of a back injury to score a century and lead Australia to 517-7 against India on a rain-interrupted second day Wednesday of the first Test.

The Australia captain made 128 - his 28th Test century - while Steve Smith made a career-best unbeaten 162 to put the hosts in a powerful position.

Clarke returned to the crease after retiring hurt on 60 on Tuesday with a flare-up of his chronic back and hamstring injuries. He also had to work through the emotional challenge of playing for the first time since the passing of team-mate and close friend Phillip Hughes, who died after being hit by a ball during a domestic match.

Clarke set himself the task of honoring Hughes' memory, and became the third centurion of the innings after Smith and David Warner, who made 145. All three centurions were state teammates of Hughes for New South Wales, and had come up through the ranks with him.

Smith was on 98 when rain washed out the morning session after only 56 minutes. He went to his century from the first ball after the resumption and, like Warner, emotionally acknowledged Hughes, fans, and teammates before embracing Clarke.

His innings helped Australia get back on top after India captured three quick wickets late on day one to put itself back in the match.

'I enjoy batting with Michael,' Smith said. 'He always gets off strike well and he's always busy at the crease.

'It was nice to put on a good partnership with him. It was just nice to form a big partnership with (Clarke) who batted beautifully as well.

'He was obviously struggling a little bit with his injury but he got through that, and did a great job.'

Rain also forced Clarke to wait longer for his century. He was 98 and only 11 balls had been bowled in the second session when rain again chased players from the field. The sense of thwarted expectation was so great that fans booed as the players left the field for the longest of the day's rain breaks.

When they returned almost two hours later, Clarke took a single from Varun Aaron to advance to 99, then another single to reach his century.

Tears flowed for Clarke and team-mates, as they have so often in the past two weeks since Hughes' death. Clarke has shouldered the load as captain, being a spokesman for the team, and a supportive presence for his family.

His achievement on Wednesday may have been cathartic for the Australian team, its captain and its fans, who, when Australia reached 408 - matching Hughes' cap number - rose to their feet to offer their personal ovation.

Between rain showers, Australia added 163 runs for the loss of Clarke's wicket and a declaration was likely overnight or early Thursday to allow its pace bowlers to start fresh without needing to bat.
