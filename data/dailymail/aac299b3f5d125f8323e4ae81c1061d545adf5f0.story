Richard Bowler, 35, has been jailed for five years after he was convicted of Alun Williams' manslaughter by gross negligence

A disabled man has been found guilty of killing a chef who died after he was wrapped in clingfilm and PVC during a sex game.

P&O head chef Alun Williams, 47, suffered a heart attack after allegedly asking to be hooded and swathed from head to toe in plastic sheeting.

Richard Bowler, 35, was today jailed for five years after he was convicted of Mr Williams' manslaughter by gross negligence while his co-defendant, David Connor, 23, was cleared of the same charge.

Canterbury Crown Court heard Mr Williams  - who had an interest in mummification and bondage - arrived at the flat where Bowler and Connor lived in Dover, Kent, after he exchanged text messages with Bowler.

A jury heard that the chef would often meet men online for sex.

The trial at Canterbury Crown Court was told that Bowler suffers from cerebral palsy, and Connor was his informal carer.

Connor told the police that he left the flat after Bowler told him he had a man coming round for a sex session, the jury heard.

He said he returned at 1am last August 20 and that Bowler told him that Mr Williams had wanted to be wrapped in clingfilm.

Just before 6am, Bowler dialled the emergency services, telling them Mr Williams had stopped breathing after they had indulged in a 'kinky sex game'.

Bowler is said to have cut open the clingfilm and plastic sheeting before performing CPR on Mr Williams, who lived with his girlfriend.

Bowler told the operator: 'It's a bit embarrassing. It's my friend, he's called Alun. I have known him for five years. I'm gay, he's gay.'

Connor could be heard in the background as Bowler added: 'We had a bit of a kinky sex game and he's stopped breathing.'

Bowler also told the operator: 'I thought he was just sleeping. I am sorry, I should have called before. He takes ketamine and that mongs him out.'

He went on: 'He's on my bed, he's wrapped in a PVC sheet with tape and that. He's got clingfilm wrapped around his body and I have got a text message on my phone stating that's what he likes.'

Bowler's co-defendant, David Connor, 23, was cleared of the same charge. The court heard that sexual acts had taken place between the three men

Mr Williams was found wrapped tightly from head to toe in the clingfilm and plastic sheeting, with just enough space left around his nose and mouth so he could breathe.

The court heard that sexual acts had taken place between the three men. A post-mortem examination found Mr Williams died following body wrapping while under the influence of drugs.

Shortly after 6am that morning, Connor walked into the taxi rank where his mother worked and said 'Mum, Richard's killed someone', the court was told.

Prosecutor Ian Hope said police found substances including ketamine, cocaine, methamphetamine and amyl nitrate, also known as poppers, in Mr Williams' rucksack.

They also found a gas mask and ties in his bag. Sex toys, masking tape, duct tape, black plastic sheeting and clingfilm were also found in the flat, the jury heard.

Bowler and Connor had denied a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence.

Following around four hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Bowler and cleared Connor.

Bowler's defence was that he took all reasonable care for Mr Williams.

It was said on his behalf that he could not have foreseen that wrapping Mr Williams up in clingfilm and PVC would have led to his death.

Connor claimed that he only acted on the instructions of Mr Williams and Bowler and could not have foreseen his death.

Part-way through the trial, Judge Adele Williams ruled that a charge of manslaughter against both men be dropped. 

Detective Inspector Richard Vickery, from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said following the case: 'This is a tragic death of a man well-liked by his colleagues and friends.

'Bowler had a responsibility to look after the welfare of Mr Williams when he entered their home and spent the evening with him. Due to the nature in which he was restrained he should never have left him alone for extended periods of time - but he did.

'I'm pleased the courts have recognised this responsibility and found him guilty of manslaughter. I hope this verdict and sentence goes some way to providing those who were close to Mr Williams some closure after what has been a very difficult time.'
