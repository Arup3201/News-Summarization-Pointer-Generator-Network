In a house boasting 45 bedrooms set over seven storeys, you can bet it’s a bit of a faff if you need a glass of water in the night.

That said, if you’ve got the £300million needed to buy this super-mansion, there’s every chance that will be someone else’s problem.

The London residence by Hyde Park has come on the market following the death of owner Sultan bin Abdulaziz, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.

A very des res: The £300million 'family home' on sale facing Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, which used to be owned by the late Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri

The house was also owned by Rafiq Hariri, the late former prime minister of Lebanon and billionaire tycoon, until his assassination by a huge bomb in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, in 2005.

After
 his death, it was given as a gift to Sultan bin Abdulaziz, the late 
Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, with whom Mr Hariri had close business 
ties.

Leading London estate agents Savills 
and Beauchamp Estates both told the FT the property, which is not 
officially on the market, is probably the largest single family home 
left in London.

If it sells it will become the most expensive private home in Britain,  more than double the previous UK 
house-price record of £140million. The incredible price tag shows how far the luxury London 
property market has boomed even as the UK economy tanks.

It is being offered to a select list of wealthy international buyers.

With a valuation nearly 800 times the average London property price of £388,000, it seems set to become the most expensive home ever sold in Britain.

Originally built as four separate family houses, the grand seven-storey, stucco-fronted residence runs from 2-8A Rutland Gate, Knightsbridge.

The 60,000sq/ft living space - only slightly smaller than a football pitch - includes a large swimming pool, industrial-size catering kitchen, underground parking and several lifts.

Millions of pounds worth of gold leaf adorn the internal decor, it is rumoured, and the windows of the house, of which 68 face towards Hyde Park, are thought to be bullet proof.

Charles McDowell, a London-based consultant specialising in high-end residential property, said: 'It is a truly rarefied property.'

Rafiq Al-Hariri was a business tycoon who made his fortune as head of the main construction firm used by the Saudi Royal family for important developments.

He had two stints as Prime Minister of Lebanon - from 1992 to 1998 and again from 2000 until his resignation on October 20, 2004.

He died months after leaving office, when explosives equivalent to around 1000kg of TNT were detonated as his motorcade drove passed the St. George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, Beirut.

The investigation into the assassination is still ongoing, with initial reports indicating that the Syrian government may be linked to the assassination.

Hariri's killing led to massive political change in Lebanon, including the Cedar Revolution and the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.

Hariri dominated the country's post-war political and business life and is widely credited with reconstructing Beirut after the 15-year civil war.

Charles 
McDowell, a London-based consultant specialising in high-end residential
 property, told the paper: 'It is a truly rarefied property on the 
market and whoever buys it is going to pay a lot of premium for the 
unusual size in that location.'

He added: 'You are going to have to wait a long, long time for something like this to come on the market again.'

Oliver Hooper, from high-end property
 purchasing agency Huntly Hooper, said: 'The property is one of London’s
 most unique residences and really only comparable to two others.

'Those are Bridgewater House next to St 
James’s Palace, which is owned by the Latsis family, and Dudley House, 
in Mayfair owned by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who is the Emir 
of Qatar.

'As Bridgewater 
House and Dudley House are not for sale, I suspect this will be the only
 chance to get a house of this size in the area for a good number of 
years.'

He added: 'We heard
 it might be coming up for sale about six months ago and there will be a
 number of potential buyers for this despite the price tag.

'The house is located overlooking Hyde Park, but there are security screens on the windows so no-one can see inside.

The seven-storey property, located in the heart of Knightsbridge, has been valued at 1,300 times the price of the average UK home

Spread over 60,000sq ft, the palatial residence has several lifts, underground parking and a decor rumoured to contain millions of pounds worth of gold leaf

'I suspect the buyer will be foreign and the purchase of it kept very confidential.'

Mr Hooper added that from a valuation
 point of view, the asking price is accurate - with properties nearby 
selling for considerably more than the £5,000 per sq/ft.

The current record for a UK house 
price sale is £140million for Park Place, a 300-year-old country house 
that backs on to the Thames near Henley.

The
 Grade II-listed Franco-Italianate mansion was sold by developer Michael
 Spink in an off-market deal with an unidentified Russian buyer in 
August last year.

The 
Rutland Gate property is three times the £100million asking price of 
Heath Hall in Hampstead, which was previously the most expensive house 
currently for sale in London.

London's
 premium property market, defined as the top 5 per cent of the market by
 value, has in the past two years attracted billions in investment from 
overseas buyers.

Thanks to 
the interest from wealthy foreign investors, prices in this bracket have
 risen 49 per cent since March 2009 according to estate agents Knight 
Frank.
