Heir to Hoy. It’s a mantle that Callum Skinner naturally ducks, insisting that there will only ever be one Sir Chris; for starters, it would be hard to imagine Scotland building another velodrome in order to honour yet another god of the boards.

Still, Skinner is Scotland’s No. 1 male track rider. That’s an honour to be prized in itself. A status that the 21-year-old seems to carry with some sense of authority.

He’s competing in three events at Glasgow 2014 – the sprint, team sprint and kerin, the latter complete with moped-riding Dr Death figure leading the riders around at ever-increasing speed before a manic finish.

Plans to ride in the lung-bursting, eyeball-popping, strength-sapping kilo were only scratched at the last minute. Because riding in *four* all-or-nothing events would be just silly, right?

After a fortnight together, Skinner and his two wing men go in the team sprint on Wednesday, each aware that they’re following in some pretty impressive traditions.

‘We’re lucky to have come through at a time when Chris Hoy, Craig MacLean and others have already blazed a trail for Scottish and British track cycling,’ Skinner, a key member of the Team GB set-up built in part on the strength of Hoy, tells Sportsmail.

‘It’s a real honour to know that we’re benefiting from the things they did, learning in a system that they helped to develop. But that doesn’t mean we can ever be compared to someone like Chris.

‘Personally, I’m trying to make a name for myself. There is no shortcut in cycling, you simply have to work your way to the top. Just because you’re Scottish or British, doesn’t mean you have some right to win a race.

‘I feel ready. With the Scotland team doing their holding camp in Manchester, where I’m based with British Cylcling all the time, it’s been ideal for me.

‘We’ll have had just over two weeks together before the Games. That should be enough to get us reacquainted with each other, pick the best team – and get ready to compete.

‘It’s been a bit tricky catching up with Team Scotland riders. They’ve all been run off their feet, especially the coaches. But I know them all really well.

‘The team sprint is going to be exciting, I think. We’ve had some real internal competition for places – which is something that has been missing from the Scotland squad for four or five years.

‘It’s nothing but a positive to have guys fighting for places because it pushes everybody on. Personally, my team sprint form is pretty good going into the Games.’

Skinner was actually inspired to take up track cycling by watching Hoy win gold in the kilo at the Athens Olympics back in 2004 – and, within four years, he’d won the inaugural Chris Hoy trophy as reward for an explosive start in the sport.

The Edinburgh rider has rarely dropped pace since, despite suffering breathing problems that threatened to prevent him reaching his potential.

‘The asthma thing is something I’ve had problems with recently,’ he says, adding: ‘But I’ve been working with specialists who have managed to come up with a solution.

‘There have been times in the past when I’ve had coughs that drag on and on, two or three weeks at least. I’ve had it from childhood – and, when I was a junior, I took almost a month off because I couldn’t shift this cold.

‘You get athletes who are always injured, some who always get ill. If you get both, you won’t make much progress!

‘British Cycling have been very helpful, sending me to a specialist with more qualifications and awards than I could ever remember.

'He’s a real respiratory specialist and he’s been great at solving the problem, to the extent that less than a week after having a chest infection I’m back to full fitness – that’s a world away from where I used to be.’

Training in Manchester, Skinner has been winding up his Team GB mates now representing their own home nations, the intra-squad banter building as the Games have approached. Anything to gain an edge?

‘I am into my sports psychology and, funnily enough, my sports psychologist will be competing at the Games,’ revealed Skinner.

‘He’s going to be a tandem pilot for Northern Ireland – Dave Readle. It’ll be quite funny to see him there. I wish him the best and glad he’s not competing in my event, because he’ll know all my weaknesses.

‘For me, once I get to the start, I am quite content. But I concern myself with all the little things you have to do just to get to the start line.

‘My warm-up will start an hour or an hour-and-a-half before then, everything is quite carefully done.

‘When I’m on the track, it’s simple. You ride your bike as fast you can, hope it’s good enough to win.

‘As for the rest of the competition, it’s been a bit more tricky than normal because normally the Aussies and Kiwis come to the races we – British Cycling – were at in Germany recently .They’re considered the Mecca for sprint cycling.

‘You tend to get 60-odd world class sprinters battling hard all day, until someone finishes on top. But the Kiwis and Aussies both went elsewhere this year.

‘You can get quite drawn into worrying about how fast someone else is, what they’ve been doing here and there – I prefer to focus on my own preparation. If a Kiwi did a world-record time, what would I do about it? It wouldn’t affect me.

‘I go back to the World Junior Championships, when all the riders were staying in the hotel, all making the classic mistake. We’d see a German posting on Twitter that he’d done an incredible time – and the only basis for it is what he’s written in those 140 characters.

‘There could be nothing behind it at all. But he’s posted it, managed to rattle you a bit – and that was the intention. It’s best to keep your head out of that.’

Like most Team Scotland competitors, Skinner has only reached this point thanks to the backing of family – particularly dad Scott and mum, Judith Crichton. As long as neither of them emulate the on-screen antics of Bert le Clos, the dad of South African swimmer Chad becoming a TV smash with his ‘unbelievable’ outburst, Callum will be more than happy to give them their due.

‘My mum and dad have been through the whole process since day one and, although they’ll play it down, it’s massively important for them to be involved in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,’ said Callum.

‘They probably remember getting me my first bike. My mum is the sporty one, she’ s always been a real help through difficult times.

‘She is probably training harder than me at the moment – she works three days a week and does triathlon training the rest of the time. She’s massively into it, really working hard

‘She keeps giving me updates and it’s a role reversal from what I used to do: “I did this time today, it’s second best in my age category …” I’m sending her messages back saying: “Well done.”

‘I remember even when she was working full time, she did a few marathons. I got the sporting gene from here, definitely.

‘She’s even been away at a warm-weather training camp, which is the kind of stuff we do. It’s amazing. She’s really diving in head first with it.

‘My dad is at the opposite end of the spectrum. The less activity, the better. It’s quite good to have that contrast, because I can speak to each of them about different aspects of life.

‘It’s great for the parents of. My favourite one was the South African dad at the swimming at London 2012. My mum could be on TV, no problem – although she would probably want to talk about her triathlon time!

‘She might also have some baby photos of me, which could be interesting if she started showing them ….’
