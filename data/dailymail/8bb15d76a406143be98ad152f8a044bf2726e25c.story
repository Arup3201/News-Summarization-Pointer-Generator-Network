Motoring blog Hot Rods wrote: 'Brian’s survival is testament to the safety measures and the obvious craftsmanship in the roll structure. SCTA over the past few years has mandated head-and-neck restraints and side-to-side head support, and it’s saved a lot of guys in snap rollovers like this.

'Land speed racers also wear arm restraints to keep hands inside the car during episodes of high centrifugal force like this.'

Mr Gillespie's weekend had begun well - he made a 200.9-mph record of the meet that secured both his El Mirage 200 MPH Club membership and the season championship, reported blog BangShift.
