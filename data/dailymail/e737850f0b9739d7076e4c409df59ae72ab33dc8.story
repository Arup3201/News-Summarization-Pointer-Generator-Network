The Ohio parents of Olympic gold medalist Tianna Madison have filed a $50,000 lawsuit against her, saying she falsely spread stories they had been selfish and bullying and cheated her financially causing her bankruptcy.

Elyria residents Robert and Jo Ann Madison filed the libel, slander and defamation lawsuit on Thursday in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court in Cleveland. They say they've been loving, supportive and generous parents.

The lawsuit, which also names her husband, John Bartoletta, reportedly says Madison and Bartoletta have repeatedly made false statements since March to the media.

The complaint alleges that Madison falsely said her parents mismanaged her finances and knowingly allowed a boy who had molested her in the past to enter their home.

Tianna Madison was on the winning 4x100-meter relay track team at the Summer Olympics in London. She won the gold with Allyson Felix, Bianca Knight and Carmelita Jeter in world record time.

The parents' lawsuit seeks more than $25,000 each in compensatory and punitive damages.

Madison did not return to her hometown of Elyria, Ohio following her record-setting performance in London.

Her parents held a rally for their daughter in Elyria in July before the start of the Olympics, but she did not attend.

At the event Mrs Madison said: 'We've been extremely busy for this and 
in our personal lives as well. I'm really on an emotional rollercoaster 
myself.'

Mr Madison said his daughter had 'been working on this for 12 years, and it’s here'.

They also travelled to London to see their daughter win gold.

Jo Ann Madison said in the complaint that she and her husband have 
spent around $100,000 supporting their daughter and do not recognise the claims she is making against them in the media.

The parents claim that their daughter and 
her husband, have repeatedly published false 
and defamatory statements in media outlets.

Brian Butler who is the spokesman for Tianna Madison and John Bartoletta said that his clients would not be commenting publicly on the lawsuit.

'This should be a time for not just Tianna, but her family to celebrate all she has gone through and her winning a gold medal,' said Butler to the Chronicle and Telegram.

'That is what she is going to focus on at this time.'

He added that despite the action against Madison and Bartoletta, all the couple wanted to do was to celebrate her recent Olympic success.

'And, I think, she is trying to take some time to enjoy the fact that she won an Olympic gold medal,' said Butler.

Jo Ann and Robert Madison's attorney, Scott Schooler said that despite the lawsuit, the couple only want to reunite with their daughter.

'They are not seeking any financial gain,' said Schooler.

'At the end of the day, they would like to restore their relationship with their daughter.

'Beyond that, I am not going to comment on the parameters of any possible resolution.'

Schooler said that his clients wanted to use this lawsuit as a method of getting their daughters attention.

'It was a wake-up call for Tianna to really look at the entire situation and look at what exactly is going on,' he said.

'Hopefully, she will realize there is some importance in having a relationship with her parents.'

Addressing the allegation that they let a child mollestor into the family home, Schooler said the Madisons have no evidence that she was ever abused.

'But secondly, assuming that fact is true, the parents had no knowledge this had ever happened,' he said.

'She did not disclose this to her parents.'

In a CNN interview last week, Tianna referenced the alleged molestation, but insisted that she was not using it as a sob story.

The breakdown in communications between the Madisons and their daughter began on March 17th when Bartoletta indicated that he and Tianna were planning to sue them for mismanaging her finances.

He also said that he was going to hire a bodyguard to protect his wife - but to date no such lawsuit has been filed.

The Madisons lawsuit contends that their daughters behaviour changed after her marriage and that she sent them a text on August 11th outlining plans to reveal their controlling attitude towards her.

This contrasts strongly with a July rally that the Madisons held in Elyrian to support the Olympic efforts of their daughter - which Tianna did not attend.

'When Tianna was young, and Christina, we trained them to read the word, love the Lord, love people, take care of people, take care of your community and the community would give back to you,' said Robert Madison during the meeting.

'When you train them this way, how to do their studies and have a good work ethic, it carries over into their athletics and academics.'

Madison is reportedly focused on training for a tryout with the U.S. bobsled team next month.

'It was totally John's idea and I'm somewhat of a daredevil,' Madison told Cleveland.com. 'We're all-in. We're going to become students of the sport, and we're going to try to shock the world.'
