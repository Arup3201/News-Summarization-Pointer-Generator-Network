Outrage: Rock Mill restaurant manager Chao Ya-hsin, 24, of Taiwan, holds the dish controversially named 'Long Live the Nazis'

An Italian restaurant in Taiwan which named a dish on its menu 'Long Live the Nazis' has claimed it did so to 'help customers'.

Chao Ya-hsin, 24, who manages the Rock Mill restaurant in Banciao, New Taipei City, said she did not realise the name would be offensive.

She has since apologised for her lack of sensitivity over the title of the spaghetti dish - which contains German sausages and broccoli.

She told the Wall Street Journal: 'When we were deciding on a name for this pasta dish, it never occurred to us that the word Nazi would stir up such controversy.' 

Ms Chao claims that for the past year the sickeningly-named meal has been one of her most popular dishes.

The restaurant recently came under fire when a local TV station featured a story about it. 

Both the Israeli and German representative officers in Taiwan told the European Pressphoto Agency that they were appalled by the name of the dish, saying it showed a lack of understanding about the Nazis and their slaughter of the Jews.

During the Holocaust, the Nazis killed approximately 15 million people, including Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, and prisoners of war in Russia and Poland.

In response to the public outcry, Ms Chao said she now plans to rename the meals 'Long Live Purity'.

She added: 'We hope from now on, customers who eat this dish will enjoy it in sheer joy.' 

Rock Mill's move to name a dish 'Long Live the Nazis' comes 14 years after a restaurant in the city covered their walls with photographs of Nazi concentration camps.

The 192-seat restaurant, called 'Jail' featured emaciated faces of Jews incarcerated in Auschwitz, Dachau and other concentration camps in framed photos. 

After it was reported, its owner took down the images, saying he did not know they were offensive.
