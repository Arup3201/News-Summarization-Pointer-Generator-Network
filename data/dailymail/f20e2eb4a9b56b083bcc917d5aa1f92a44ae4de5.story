A farm worker has regained use of his arm after it was completely severed in an accident and reattached by doctors in China.

Chen Tian, from Dongwan Town in northwest China's Gansu Province had his arm ripped off after it was sucked into an agricultural vehicle.

The 21-year-old had reportedly slipped and fallen before the limb became trapped in the machinery.

He was immediately sent to a local hospital following the gruesome accident earlier this year. 

After assessing his injuries, medics then took the decision to transfer him to the larger Lanzhou Foot and Hand Surgery Hospital for specialist treatment.

It was here that surgeons carried out an eight-hour procedure in a bid to reattach the right arm, which had been severed just above the elbow.

Chief surgeon Dong said Chen's arm had regained most of its normal functions - just weeks after the operation

Last year, it was reported that Chinese doctors had saved a man's severed hand by grafting it to his ankle.

Xiao Wei lost his right hand in an accident at work but because of the nature of the injury, could not have it reattached to his arm immediately.

Instead, the hand was kept alive by stitching it to his left ankle and using a blood supply from arteries in the leg.

According to Rex Features, surgeons were able to remove the hand and replant it back on his arm a month later.
