Disney eager to build business relationship in China through films and theme parks

A few years ago, making it big in Hollywood was all that mattered.

Now, American film studios are looking to tap into a vast new audience in China - a country with more than 1.3 billion people.

Instead of standing up to Chinese censorship, desperate to secure the release of 'Iron Man 3' in China, Disney is playing ball and allowed the country's censors to vet scripts, visit sets in the U.S. and even give suggestions on other creative decisions.

Two Versions: Chinese audiences will see a specially adapted version of the movie 'Iron Man 3'. One that meets the approval of Chinese censors

China has become world’s second-largest film market, after the United States but so different are Chinese laws, customs and tastes that American studios will do whatever it takes to have their film distributed there - even if it means making a completely new movie.

Disney has revealed that when it releases 'Iron Man 3' in a few weeks time there will be two separate versions of the superhero film.

One for Chinese audiences; the other for the rest of the world.

Hollywood executives are only just starting to figure out what works and what does not, with the 40-strong censorship board, consisting of Chinese Communist Party officials.

Stars: Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow pose for photographers during the Iron in Paris last night.

Similarly, the communist government wants Chinese studios to learn from Hollywood and is trying to attract foreign studios to form ventures by promising more market access and a bigger share of ticket sales.

For the past decade, China's state-run film distributors have allowed in only 20 foreign films per year for national distribution.

Which Hollywood films get the 'okay' in China is a murky and complicated process.

Last week the American film 'Django Unchained' was pulled from theaters in China on its opening day.

Flying the flag: It's not always America's interests at heart... Hollywood executives will do virtually anything to appease Chinese censors to have the film show in the country

Working out exactly what pleases the Chinese censors is a complex task.

Many scenes in 'Iron Man 3' were shot, along with its stars Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle, in Beijing last December.

The film was produced with DMG Entertainment, a Beijing-based production house.

DMG is a Chinese company, with 900 employees in China and headquarters in Beijing.

It means that the film could be almost be considered domestically Chinese which provides extra benefits.

Local sights: Chinese actor Wang Xueqi waves during a promotional event for the Hollywood movie ''Iron Man 3''  at the Forbidden City in Beijing. The use of Chinese locations seems to go down well with the country's censorship board

To avoid any conflict close to the release date Disney has produced a version of Iron Man 3 that includes more Chinese-shot footage and recognizable locations that appeal to more local tastes.

'We know Chinese audiences love Iron Man. So we are going to add Chinese elements and a Chinese story into Iron Man 3,' Disney's general manager for Greater China, Stanley Cheung, said at a news conference before filming began last year.

Chinese actor Wang Xueqi will appear in both versions along with the extra Beijing footage.

China’s top actress, Fan Bingbing also appears in scenes specifically designed for Chinese viewers. 

Local talent: Chinese actress Fan Bingbing (L) and Chinese actor Wang Xueqi are both appearing in 'Iron Man 3' in scenes that were shot in their home country

Marvel described the move
 in a statement as a 'springboard for future collaboration with China’s 
talented stars and its growing film and television industry.'

Hollywood
 studios have long tried to stick to Chinese censorship rules when 
releasing their pictures in the country but their demands can be 
unpredictable and capricious.

A scene from the new Brad Pitt movie World War Z had to be changed so as not to offend Chinese state censors.

Last year, scenes that were shot in Shanghai for the James Bond film 'Skyfall' had to be cut.

Scenes that portrayed the Chinese government as incompetent were removed.

'Men in Black 3', 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World’s End' and 'Mission: Impossible 3' were also edited.

Superhuman: But the films producers had Chinese censors visit the set of the movie and even allow creative suggestions to be made during the filming of 'Iron Man 3'

The difference with Iron Man 3 is that additional footage was added to appease Chinese sensitivities.

Hollywood execs are eager not to upset Chinese censors and threaten distribution in the country, the fastest growing film market in the world.

China is now a $2 billion-a-year market. More than 60 percent of box-office takings in 2012 so far came from non-Chinese pictures.

Disney has said the experience of working with the Chinese censors was 'positive'.

The company is looking to grow its business in the country as it build a brand new Disney theme park in Shanghai.

A scene of things to come? China is an extremely lucrative market for U.S. filmmakers. We can expect more co-productions to be shot and shown in the world's most populated country

Marvel has said the filmmakers look forward to 'bringing ‘Iron Man’ back to China.'

'Iron Man 3' will have its UK premiere later this week before being released on 26th April. The film will be released in the US May 3rd.

A Chinese release date has not yet been set.
