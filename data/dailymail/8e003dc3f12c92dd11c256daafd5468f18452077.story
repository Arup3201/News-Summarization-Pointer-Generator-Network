Two Czech nationals are behind bars after their wedding registrar noticed they showed no affection towards their new husbands.

Suspicions were raised further when Algerian Fateh El Fiad, 37, didn't seem to know the full name of his bride Katerina Gaborova, 27. He also appeared to have been 'coached'.

Just six days earlier, Zdenka Sudikova, 22, had tied the knot with Mahrez Benbetka, 28, also from Algeria, in another 'sham marriage'.

The happiest day of your life? Katerina Gaborova married Fateh El Fiad at Middlesbrough Register Office but the registrar noticed there was no communication, interaction or affection between the couple and reported them

The registrar at Middlesbrough Register Office had no legal right to stop the nuptials but reported concerns after they saw no communication, interaction or affection amongst the couples. 

Each of the women said they had met their partners in a coffee shop months earlier.

A jury took less than half an hour's consideration at Teesside Crown Court to convict the women who were both remanded in custody but their new husbands did not appear with them.

Both Benbetka and El Fiad had disappeared during the middle of a previours trial in October and have been on the run over since. They were convicted in their absence.

Prosecutor David Brooke said the four entered into sham marriages for the men to gain the rights of EU citizens. 

Bakery worker Sudikova, who arrived in the UK from Prague in May 2013, married Benbetka, a six-month visa overstayer, on September 24, 2013.

The pair, from Middlesbrough, were arrested by immigration officers when they went to get married earlier that month.

Benbetka denied that the marriage was a sham and Sudikova told investigators Benbetka proposed unexpectedly, she knew he was an illegal immigrant and she was happy about the marriage.

Gaborova and El Fiad, also of Middlesbrough, got married six days after Sudikova and Benbetka on September 30. 

Gaborova was photographed in her wedding dress outside Middlesbrough register office - in front of the courthouse where she was later convicted. 

She denied that the marriage was to help El Fiad's immigration status. While El Fiad said he had been refused asylum and claimed he had married another woman according to Islam in London, from whom he had separated.

After the women's guilty verdicts today, prosecutor David Brooke said: 'The Crown will be asking for a deportation recommendation from the court in due course.' 

Paul Abrahams, representing Gaborova, said she was of previous good character and asked for bail for the two women.

Nigel Soppitt, for Sudikova, said she had been in the UK for five years, had a job, her parents, roots and stability here and had nothing left for her in the Czech Republic.

She had two children, one of whom was undergoing treatment for a kidney disorder.

He asked for compassion, saying: 'It would be difficult for her simply to vanish from that young boy's life today.'

A judge, Recorder Henry Prosser, said: 'I'm sorry. I do think in this case the risk of non-appearance is so great that I shouldn't grant bail.'

He remanded the women in custody until sentencing for all four on February 13 at Newcastle Crown Court.

If the men have not been caught by then, they will be sentenced in their absence.
