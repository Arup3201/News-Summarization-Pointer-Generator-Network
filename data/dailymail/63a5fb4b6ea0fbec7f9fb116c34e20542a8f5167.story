A scrap metal dealer who was branded 'beyond contempt' for trying to sell on a haul of memorial plaques looted from a graveyard has today been jailed for 12 weeks.

Career criminal Sean McNab, 44, was arrested after staff at a scrapyard refused to buy the bronze plaques and alerted police.

The thefts had been discovered when one of families went to the cemetery to lay flowers and found their plaque missing.

Sean McNab said he was given the bag of plaques to sell on by two youths

Up to 20 bronze plaques had been unscrewed from the Garden of Remembrance at Blackley cemetery in Manchester last November in a night-time raid described by police 'beyond contempt'.

They has been paid for by families and placed in the graveyard where the ashes of their loves ones had been interred.

McNab tried to sell on the plaques – which were worth around £600 - from a bag just days after the thefts. When the yard refused he then tried to find another buyer.

At first he claimed he had no idea what was in the bag but he said he later realised they were plaques and 'felt heartbroken'.

He claimed that after he found this out he threw away the bag and rushed home to 'hold his bible to his chest begging for forgiveness'.

Only nine plaques were recovered.

At Manchester Magistrates' Court McNab, from Blackley, Greater Manchester, who has a 'significant criminal record for dishonesty' was due to stand trial for theft.

But he denied the charge and pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of handling stolen goods after claiming two youths had given him the stolen plaques to sell on.

JP Paul Welsh, told him: said: 'You are part of an offending chain that the community find abhorrent and it hurts people, hurts people in a wide circle. You provide a market place for this kind of activity.

Only nine of the 20 stolen memorial plaques have been recovered

'At that moment for one reason or another you didn't care. You do now because you're in court but at the time you didn't.'

Earlier prosecutor Matthew Siddall, said: 'This case involves memorial plaques, the circumstances are that Blackley cemetery is the area where there are a large amount of plaques.

'One of the managers, James Birch, describes an email from one of the family members who owned one of those plaques and they had been to the cemetery and found it wasn't there.

'They had been the week before so it is understood it must have taken place that week.

'That particular manager does a check and notices ten to twenty different plaques missing, in this case we are dealing with nine of those.

'Police are alerted and take a number of enquiries particular with a scrap merchant.'

Officers visited Howarth Metals on Slack Road, Blackley, as part of local inquiries on November 7. Staff said they recalled McNab trying to sell the plaques two days earlier.

'Members of staff said Sean McNab had been in the property and attempted to sell a number of memorial plaques and for obvious reasons they refused.

'Following that he came back a few days later selling copper wire. Staff managed to obtain his car registration and police saw the CCTV and they recognised him from previous dealings.'

After that McNab was arrested and his house was searched and the plaques were found in a bush not far from the scrap yard after an officer spotted the bag.

Mr Siddall continued: 'It's my understanding that this defendant says he received them in a bag and never looked inside, not knowing what they were. That's not accepted by the Crown.

'His record speaks for itself, it's quite lengthy and goes over quite a number of years.

When he was arrested he tested positive for opiates and cocaine.

'There's no victim impact statements but there is one off James Birch, the manager. He said, 'I feel the enormity of the stress far outweighs the value of any plaque'.'

In mitigation defence solicitor Joseph O'Connor, said: 'The defendant accepts he's a person known to take scrap metal and two people came to him and said can you take this scrap metal.

'He should have been aware saying can you dispose of this scrap metal it is probably going to have come from an illegitimate source. He attempted to sell it on to a second scrap yard.

'But at the time he was provided with the large bag, he didn't engage his brain.'

Mr O'Connor also added that the defendant was a carer for his father who had to undergo dialysis four times a week and relied on his son to take him to and from GP and hospital appointments.

McNab was asked how he thought the families would have felt when they went to take flowers to the memorials only to find they had been stolen.

McNab replied: 'I can imagine they were feeling heartbroken but you've got to understand I hadn't stolen anything.'
