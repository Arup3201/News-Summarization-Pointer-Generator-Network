Civil rights activists have demanded that a Django Unchained actress apologize for accusing police of singling her out because of her race.

Daniele Watts hit out at the Los Angeles Polcie Department, who she claimed pulled her up and arrested her for kissing her boyfriend in a car parked on the street last week.

However, police maintain that there was no racial element to the incident, and that their officer was responding to reports of a couple having sex in public - leading to a backlash from civil rights experts, who accuse Watts of 'crying wolf' to cover her own back.

'Crying wolf': Watts, pictured with boyfriend Brian Lucas, has come under fire from civil rights activists

An audio recording, obtained by MailOnline, reveals a hysterical Watts confronting police in a heated exchange during which she uses the N-word, and claims legal expertise from her experience playing a cop on TV.

The fallout from the incident led to prominent civil rights activists decrying Watts in public and saying that she was harming their cause.

Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable President Earl Ofari Hutchinson, Project Islamic Hope President Najee Ali and others released a statement this morning in the Inglewood area of LA.

Hutchinson said: 'There was provable cause for the detention. You must have your facts. You can't rush to judgment. If you do that, you have no credibility.' 

According to NBC, he added: 'It's like crying wolf - after a while, it has no meaning.'

Ali also spoke against her, CBS reported.

He said: 'She should be embarrassed. She's the one that told the lie. She came and stated she's a victim of racial profiling. We found out later on based on new information that she wasn't,' 

The newly-unearthed audio file came shortly after still images showed Watts straddling her boyfriend Brian James Lucas in a car.

Recordings captured the moment that police slapped handcuffs on Miss Watts after she walked away from an officer who asked to see her identification.

Watts and the officers involved disputed whether her ID card was necessary, followed by Watts bringing her acting experience into the fray.

In the audio recording, Miss Watts sobs after being cuffed. An officer can be heard trying to calm her down.

She tells him through tears: 'You're not the one in handcuffs, you're not the one who's spent your life being called a n*****, and growing up in the South and now I get the cops called on me.

'I'm an actress at this studio! I'm in a major sitcom and I'm still being put in handcuffs because I'm making out with my boyfriend.' 

Sgt Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he was offended by claims that Miss Watts was harassed because she is a black woman with a white boyfriend.

Sgt Parker said he's witnessed first hand many of the department's most dramatic moments - including the 1992 riots over the beating of black motorist Rodney King and the 1997 North Hollywood shoot out.

Throughout his career, he says he has watched the LAPD become dramatically more sensitive to race relations and diversity.  

Miss Watts and Mrs Lucas maintain they were doing nothing wrong - and that they were only making out, not having sex.

Sgt Parker said he fears that if he and other officers had not recorded their run-in with Miss Watts, her allegations would have ruined their careers.

'She picked the wrong person to make a public incident out of a private matter,' he said. 

The LAPD has said it is conducting a review of the officers' behavior, but all three remain on the streets.

MailOnline has contacted Watts's agent for comment.
