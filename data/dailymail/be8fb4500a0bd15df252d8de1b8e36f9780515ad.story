Bowe Bergdahl’s ballet teacher said today said she believes the US Army sergeant used the discipline he learned as a ballet dancer to help him survive the ordeal.

Sherry Horton, who was also Bowe’s roommate and best friend before he left to join the army, said the soldier was her ‘star’ student at Sun Valley Ballet School in his hometown of Hailey, Idaho.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline she said Bowe, now 28, was a graceful, natural performer who was ‘super strong’ and ‘flexible’ and loved to dance.

Softer side: Bowe's love of ballet goes against the grain for most rough-tough US Army sergeants

And in our exclusive photos Bowe’s dancing can be seen in full swing as he lifts a female dancer in the air to complete a string of impressive ballet moves.

Bowe’s love of ballet goes against the grain for most rough-tough US Army sergeants, but then Bowe was not your conventional soldier.

He also studied religion extensively dabbling in Buddhism and tarot-card reading.

He had sailed across the Atlantic by his late teens, fished in Alaska and practiced martial arts and sword fighting.

‘He started ballet at age 16 or 17 and was an amazing dancer, a natural talent.

‘One of my dancers was a family friend of his and he was inspired by her dedication to ballet, so he came in to see what it was all about and it all started from there.

‘He had so much natural rhythm from his martial arts and sword fighting, he was made to dance.’

‘Bowe was an expert at lifting his partners during routines,’ recalls Sherry.

Sherry said Bowe put his natural ability to good use and appeared in a number of ballet productions including the Little Mermaid and Wizard of Oz while with the school.

And, pointing to photos of Bowe on the ballet school wall, she says his dedication to dancing was such that he will have inevitably drawn on what he learned to help him get through his kidnap ordeal.

Sherry believes Bowe would have ballet techniques to keep himself occupied and physically strong while he was alone and isolated in an unknown camp in Pakistan.

‘Ballet doesn’t deviate,’ says Sherry. ‘You do Plié and you do Tendus, and it’s very structured because it’s the same every time.

‘There’s been times in my life when the only thing that saved me was ballet class and hopefully he managed to find the same solace that I did.

‘I wouldn’t be surprised to find out Bowe practiced ballet while a hostage, it’s something you can do on your own.

‘The repetitiveness of it is reassuring and will have helped keep him fit.

‘If anyone can come through this and still be in one piece, still be together, it’s Bowe.

‘He had a strength of soul and mind, he is a strong person so there’s a really good chance he’ll come out the other end okay.

‘I hope he gets back into his dancing when he’s back.’

Bowe
 was also home-schooled in a small mountain town in Idaho with a 
population of about 8,000, had no TV at home and was raised by bookworm 
parents Bob and Jani.

His friends say he enlisted in the army to help the Afghan people and provide philanthropic support to the war effort.

‘He was big on meditating and communing with nature and getting into himself,’ said Sherry.

‘That’s why I believe he would have been okay sitting by himself for a long time as a prisoner, he would have been happy in his own thoughts.

‘He just really was that kind of person who could focus on looking out for himself, soul searching.’

Sherry
 said the loving family environment in which he was raised in quiet 
Hailey meant Bowe maintained a level of ‘innocence’ before leaving to 
join the military.

And she has fond memories of their times together.

‘He was just a sweet guy, we were very close friends and I was his confidante,’ says Sherry.

‘We moved in together when he was about 18 and he lived with me until he left to go to the army when he was around 22.

‘I still consider him a roommate because I still have a closet full of his stuff.’

But Sherry says that after he was kidnapped it was hard to cope without Bowe around.

‘The past five years have been a blur,’ she said.

‘It was just so traumatic, seeing your roommate, your best friend being captured by the Taliban. I missed him so much.

‘It was tough, you always have it on your mind, you always know it is there.’

The worst part for Sherry was not knowing whether Bowe would come back dead or alive.

‘We were getting the proof of life videos, but you never really knew for sure, that was the hardest part,’ she said. ‘All we could do was hope that what we were seeing was true and he was okay.’

But Sherry is realistic about what her best friend will be like once he returns to normality.

She says she fully expects to welcome a very different man to the ‘fun-loving’ and ‘innocent’ 20-something guy who she once shared an apartment with.

She says: ‘His innocence will be gone, it’s going to be a different Bowe for sure, but because of his strength and the strength of his family he will get back to a place where he can be at ease with himself, I’m sure of that.’

Bowe’s parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl, believe the 28-year-old has a long road to recovery.

He is currently resting and awaiting debriefing at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany and might not be home for weeks yet.

Bowe was the only known missing U.S. 
soldier in the Afghan war after being captured under unknown 
circumstances in eastern Afghanistan by militants on June 30, 2009 - 
about two months after arriving in the country.

After
 years of negotiation he was finally freed in a deal that resulted in 
five Taliban members held at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, being 
turned over to Qatar.

When the news broke on Saturday morning it prompted wild celebration in Bowe’s hometown.

The streets and shop windows along Main Street in Hailey have been decked with yellow ribbons and balloons and banners reading "Bowe is Free at Last!"

Sherry, a wide smile breaking across her face, said jubilantly: ‘It’s a huge weight off my shoulders and comes right in the middle of Spring.

‘Everything is new, the flowers are blooming, it is a perfect time for this to happen, life is good.

‘I just can’t wait to see him and give him a hug, there’s so much to catch up on.

‘I’m still dating the same guy from when he left.’

‘Everyone in Hailey wants to celebrate and share stories, it is such a wonderful time in general, we are a close knit community and now we’re even closer.’
