Two Brooklyn-based artists are proving how much waste is left on the streets of New York by creating elaborate sets made from unwanted furniture  all over the city.

Prop stylist Gözde Eker and photographer Justin Bettman have so far recreated a young boy's bedroom, a bathroom with a claw-foot tub, a dining room fit for a dinner party, and living rooms complete with sofas and wall art.

After shooting their photos, Mr Bettman and Mr Eker leave the sets up on the street, where New York City residents are encouraged to shoot their own photos and post them on social media using the hashtag #setinthestreet.

Some critics have accused Mr Bettman and Mr Eker of littering, but the duo says the ongoing art project does just the opposite.

'People are blown away with how beautiful these sets look, and if they don't see the zoomed-out picture, a lot of people think these were shot in a real home or a real set,' Mr Bettman told The Daily Beast.

'But it's almost entirely stuff that's been thrown away. I think it's an interesting commentary, that there's a lot out there if you look for it.'

The photographer finds unwanted furniture along his daily seven-mile run to work, keeping everything in a friend's gated, and padlocked parking spot

'A lot of the stuff I find while I'm running,' he said. 'Then, depending on how urgent I think it is to get, sometimes I have to go back home and drop it off'

Mr Bettman added that whatever isn't stolen by a certain 'removal' date specified on each site, the duo plan to clean up.

'Everything has disappeared so far, so we haven’t had to clean anything up,' he explained.

Mr Bettman and Mr Eker start each set off with a hero piece, and flesh it out from there

'With the first set I did, the colors of the couch determined that the rest of it would be blue and yellow and white,' he said.

Each set is built overnight so they are able to shoot it at sunrise and then leave, waiting for pedestrians to stumble upon the elaborate set-ups themselves

'So there’s the first hero piece, and then there's smaller things that you add to make one piece into a whole set.'

'Hopefully it will be up for the day, if not a few days or even a week, before people start stealing s***. It takes two to three hours.'
