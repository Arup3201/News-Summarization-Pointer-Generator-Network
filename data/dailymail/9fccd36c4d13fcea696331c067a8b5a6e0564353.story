Don't be surprised if this couple look familiar.

Graham Winston-Peters and Ivy Pink may not be household names, but they have appeared on more TV shows than most celebrities.

They are so obsessed that they have notched up more than 50 ‘reality’ appearances in the past ten years – and that’s not counting their work as extras and in music videos.

'We're not shy': Graham Winston-Peters and his wife Ivy Pink, seen discussing their nudist wedding on the This Morning sofa, have racked up scores of TV appearances

The couple, from Leatherhead, Surrey,
got married in the nude on television for the show Four Weddings and 
discussed their sex lives in front of the nation on This Morning.

Miss Pink said she would even have given birth live if anyone would have had her.

They got their taste for television 
in 2003 when Mr Winston-Peters went on ITV’s Bootsale Challenge and have
subsequently won four competitions and taken home prize money from a 
variety of game shows.

On camera: Graham proposed to Ivy while they were in the audience on the TV show All Star Mr & Mrs

Getting hitched: Graham and Ivy embrace in front of the cameras after getting engaged while in a live studio audience 

‘I auditioned for the first show on a
whim and really enjoyed it,’ said Mr Winston-Peters, 47. ‘I won the 
second show I went on, then I wanted to do more and more.

‘We’re very quick-witted and extravagant, we say exactly what we feel and nothing fazes us so TV shows love us.’

The couple met in Amsterdam at the 
Van Gogh museum and after a whirlwind romance the venue for Mr 
Winston-Peters’ proposal was, of course, a television studio, although 
this time they were in the audience on All Star Mr & Mrs. Miss Pink 
said the wedding was ‘incredible’.

‘We got married on Four Weddings. 
It’s my favourite show we’ve done,’ she said.  ‘We had a nudist wedding 
and won a luxury honeymoon to Jamaica.

Look familiar? Ivy Pink and Graham Winston-Peters have appeared on around 50 different TV shows

'The only thing  that would have made it better was if it was a nudist resort.

‘We’ve been on This Morning together twice – once to talk about the wedding and once to talk about threesomes.

‘We’re not shy and we’re happy to talk about our sex lives on television.’

The couple have also appeared as 
extras, had acting parts and even starred in music videos. Mr 
Winston-Peters has made appearances in Ashes to Ashes, Law and Order and
Midsomer Murders, as well as appearing in the new film Red 2.

Between them they have made well over 100 appearances in television shows and films.

However, the couple have one dream 
that has yet to turn into reality TV. They have reached the final round 
of the Big Brother auditions three times, but have never made it into 
the house.

‘It’s gutting to have been so close and to have missed out,’ said Mr Winston-Peters.

Ms Pink recently appeared in the video for Olly Murs’ single Dance With Me Tonight while her husband features in the video for This Ain't a Love Song by Scouting for Girls.

Mr Winston-Peters can also be spotted in episodes of Ashes to Ashes, Law and Order and Midsomer Murders, and features in the new film Red 2.

In total the limelight-loving pair have notched up more than 100 appearances on television and film - and they're not satisfied yet.

Mr Winston-Peters wants to branch out beyond reality shows and forge a full-time acting career.

'It’s my 
ambition to get into acting full time, but I love reality shows too,' he said.

'I’m
just myself in front of the camera.

'I
think we have proved now that we’re not just in it for the attention, 
if I was I would have made a mark and then gone. You have to keep on 
going and not take any notice of what people say.

'They
only know what they see on TV, but I’ve done so many different things, I
can be one person in something, and then someone completely different 
in something else, so how do they know what I’m like?'

His wife also wants to spend more time on screen, and is particularly keen to appear on One Born Every Minute.

'I’d have given birth on TV when we had our first child, but no-one would have me,' Ms Pink said.

'I’d love to go on One Born Every Minute. I know some people think it’s disgusting but it’s life, it’s amazing.'

'Favourite show': The couple shared their nuptials with the cameras when they appeared on the programme Four Weddings

Reaping the rewards: The couple's unusual choice of wedding won them a luxury honeymoon in Jamaica

'Quick-witted and extravagent': Graham, seen with his wife on Coach Trip, says he hopes to branch out beyond reality TV and forge a full-time acting career

'Can't get enough': The couple have auditioned unsuccessfully for Big Brother three times

'TV shows love us': As well as Coach Trip, the pair have appeared on Britain's Empty Homes, Big Brother's Big Mouth and Help, I've Got a High Maintenance Wife

Sexcetera: The couple say they are happy to discuss their sex life on camera

Attention-seeker: Mr Winston-Peters, 47, met wife Ivy Pink in Amsterdam and the couple moved in together within a fortnight
