The Justice Secretary pledged yesterday to ‘turn the tide’ of criminality as a raft of new measures were announced aimed at encouraging prolific offenders away from crime.

Tens of thousands of short-sentence prisoners will be put on compulsory supervision for at least 12 months after their release in a ‘targeted rehabilitation’ programme, said Chris Grayling.

Compulsory drug testing for thousands of burglars, robbers and drug offenders will be extended so they can be hauled back to jail if caught using cannabis. Current tests cover only Class A drugs.

David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband stand in the House of Lords to listen the Queen's speech, which included a raft of measurements designed to rehabilitate prolific criminals

The measures, revealed in the Queen’s Speech, are included in a new draft law, the Offender Rehabilitation Bill, which will be published in full today.

Inmates will serve the final months of their jail term near home in ‘resettlement jails’ designed to prepare them for release.

The measurements aim to make a dent in the 'appetite of offenders'

Once out, they will be prevented from moving around the country and will have to work at rebuilding their lives.

The former convicts will have to seek permission to move out of their local area to ensure they stick to community orders, instead of merely notifying probation as at present.

Paedophiles, rapists and convicted terrorists will be placed on GPS tags so their movements can be monitored at all times.

And vast swathes of the Probation Service will be contracted out to private companies and charities paid ‘by results’ if they turn criminals into honest citizens.

Opponents said this could lead to the public being put at risk if private firms put profit ahead of safety.

Mr
Grayling said he wanted to ‘put a stopper in the revolving door of the 
justice system’ which sees as many as six in ten short-sentence 
offenders return to crime within a year of their release.

‘Tackling our stubbornly high reoffending rates has dogged successive governments for decades,’ he said.

‘These reforms represent a golden opportunity to finally turn the tide.

‘It is simply not good enough that we 
spend £4billion a year on prisons and probation and yet make no real 
dent in the appetite of offenders to commit more crime.

‘It is little wonder when many of our most prolific criminals leave prison totally unsupervised in the community.

‘These reforms are essential and will ensure that offenders are properly punished but also given targeted support to help them turn away from crime for good.’

Mr Grayling hopes to save millions by using private firms and charities to run rehabilitation projects outside the State sector.

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme this morning that the focus would be on finding efficiencies and there would be no extra money for the extra work.

'We have a system at the moment where only around 25 per cent of probation officers' time is spent working with offenders. Something like 40 per cent of the resources is spent support costs,' he said.

'We have reoffending rates that are rising among offenders jailed for less than a year. At the moment they walk out onto the streets with £46 in their pockets and that's it. That cannot be a sensible system and it needs to change.'

He continued: 'We are talking about 250,000 people a year being supported through probation at the moment. This (reform) will bring another 50,000 people into the net for the first time. I am going to pay for that with a system that is less bureaucratic and more efficiently run.'

But criminal justice analyst and former probation officer Harry Fletcher said: ‘There is no evidence that probation is failing. The experience of privatisation so far has been extremely disappointing.

‘All the evidence shows that probation has met all its targets and there is a real risk that public protection will be compromised if this controversial scheme goes ahead.’

Currently, prisoners serving 12 months or less are not given probation support when behind bars, and can spend as little as a few days in touch with their probation officer on release. This group of offenders committed more than 80,000 crimes in the year after their release.

From 2015, all inmates will be given support services while in jail irrespective of the length of their sentence. And all will spend at least a year being monitored in the community after release.

During this period, they will be required to undergo drug rehab, skills training and other programmes to help them reform.

Owners of dangerous dogs that maul children on private property will face jail.

The government is closing a  loophole which has left police unable to bring prosecutions even in  fatal cases.

The new law will also apply to attacks on postmen and other visitors to private houses or gardens.

Ministers defied the anger of Middle England as they unveiled plans to ‘fast-track’ the Government’s controversial £33billion high-speed HS2 rail scheme.

The Government said it was ‘cracking on’ at a pace with the flagship project, insisting: ‘It will become a matter of when, not if, the entire 351 miles of new railway will be built.’
