Bill and Hillary Clinton are making the most of their new-found time as grandparents, ditching political events to spend as much time as possible with the latest member of family.

The former President and his potential candidate wife were seen today making another visit to the Lenox Hill hospital in Manhattan, where Chelsea Clinton gave birth to her first daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, Friday evening.

The beaming couple, who arrived separately, both waved for cameras again as they made their way inside to see their daughter in her plush maternity suite - which reportedly costs thousands of dollars a night.

It came as political allies - who had been hoping for an appearance - accepted that the new birth takes priority.

New Hampshire state senator Lou D'Allesandro today confirmed to CNN that Hillary had pulled out of a fundraiser tomorrow, telling the network: 'Baby came, family first'.

Bill has already bowed out of a scheduled appearance to help Senator Mark Udall at a fundraising  event in Colorado.

The couple, who married in July 2010, announced in April that they were expecting their first child.

Bill and Hillary had been publicly gushing for months at the prospect of becoming grandparents, though Chelsea's exact due date had been kept quiet.

In a recent TV interview, former President Bill said :'I hope by the first of October, I'll be a grandfather.' He has since been proved right.

Last week, Hillary Clinton also excited fans as she told a crowd at political steak fry in Indianola, Iowa: 'Bill and I are on constant grandchild watch. So don't be surprised if we suddenly go sprinting off the stage.

'I want to babysit any chance I get,' she added.

When Chelsea announced her pregnancy during a Clinton Foundation event devoted to empowering young women, she told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.

'I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders,' she added.

'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.' 

Lenox Hill hospital, two blocks from Central Park in Manhattan's Upper East Side, is no stranger to celebrity patients.

The center has hosted high-profile politicians and entertainers, and reportedly offers lavish birth suits at prices of $1,700 per night.

Beyoncé Knowles gave birth to her and Jay Z's child, Blue Ivy, in one of the 'executive suites' in 2012.

Joan Rivers also gave birth there in the 1960s, and in 2002 Sarah Jessica Parker made use of it too.

Actress Liz Taylor and singer Barry Manilow and General MacArthur were also prominent patients.  

Burnishing its Presidential connections, John F Kennedy Jnr, son to JFK, was once a patient, as was former First Lady Pat Nixon.
