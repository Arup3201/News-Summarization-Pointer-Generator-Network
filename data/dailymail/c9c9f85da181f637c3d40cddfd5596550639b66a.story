A cyclist died after colliding with a lorry during rush hour in front of horrified commuters in central London today.

The emergency services arrived within three minutes of the accident but the cyclist, who was in her mid thirties, was pronounced dead at the scene in Victoria at 8.25 am.

The bicycle was thought to have caught under the wheels of the construction lorry as the cyclist and the driver both turned left.

Poignant: The woman's broken bicycle was left on the road while the police cleared the area and re-opened the streets around Victoria

Killed immediately: Police cordoned off the site of the collision at the junction of London's Victoria Street and Palace Street

Commuters around Victoria Station spoke of witnessing the accident this morning.  Robert Niven wrote on Twitter: 'Just walked passed a harrowing scene on Victoria street where a cyclist has been knocked down and unfortunately have lost their life.

Police had to close the busy street going both ways while they cordoned off the broken bicycle on the corner of Victoria Street and Palace Street.

The driver of the lorry was interviewed by police, but not arrested.A security guard who witnessed the 
accident told the Evening Standard: 'Some workers from the construction 
site rushed down to help the passers-by who had gone to the cyclist's 
aid.

'They came running down and did what they could until the paramedics arrived.'

Police said they knew the identity of the cyclist and they were trying to contact her family this morning.

'

Mike
Cavenett, from the London Cycling Campaign, said tipper lorries have a 
high driving position and poor visibility for the driver.

He said: 'Reducing the danger that lorries pose has to be the number one priority.'

'We
want lorries to be equipped with sensors or cameras to help the 
drivers, and cyclist awareness training for every lorry driver in 
London.'

Mayor Boris Johnson joined the calls for greater safety for vulnerable cyclists.

He said today that he
wants to ban HGVs from the capital unless they are fitted with extra safety 
measures, including 'skirts' and special mirrors.

Last year a total of 14 cyclists died in accidents in London.

A
study by Transport for London found that although lorries only make up 
just five per cent of traffic, they are responsible for half of all 
cyclist deaths.

Today's fatality is the second cyclist to die on London’s roads this year.
