India's hopes of reaching the final of the Tri-Series remain alive after their one-day international against Australia was abandoned after just 16 overs in Sydney due to rain.

The no result means Friday's match between Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men and England in Perth will be a straight shootout to play Australia in Sunday's final at the same venue.

The tournament's hosts would have been hoping to mark Australia Day in fine style by claiming their fourth win from as many matches and had reduced their opponents to 69 for two before the rain intervened.

George Bailey returned to the side after missing the win over England due to suspension and won the toss, choosing to field first.

After just 16 legal deliveries, the teams were forced off for the first time due to the inclement weather, with the match reduced to 44 overs per side after a near hour delay.

On the resumption, Shikhar Dhawan played away from his body and edged Mitchell Starc to first slip, having made just eight.

Ambati Rayudu seemed in confident mood, lofting Mitchell Marsh for six in his 23 off 24 balls, but the Perth man would have his revenge when the batsman miscued to David Warner, who took a superb catch running back from cover.

They were then forced off for a second time but on this occasion they would not return, leaving Ajinkya Rahane unbeaten on 28 and Virat Kohli on three not out.
