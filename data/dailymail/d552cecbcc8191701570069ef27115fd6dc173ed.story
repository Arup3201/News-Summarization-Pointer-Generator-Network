Aaron Lennon has revealed his excitement at becoming an Everton player after joining the club on loan on transfer deadline day from Tottenham.

The Toffees will pay £1million up front but the clubs have not agreed a fee to make the deal permanent. 

Lennon had been unveiled by the Merseyside outfit on Tuesday, but looked less than impressed with his new surroundings as he posed at their Finch Farm training ground.

'I'm really looking forward to seizing this opportunity at a club with such a history,' said Lennon

Goals: Leeds (one), Tottenham (30 goals in 365 games)

However, the 27-year-old was quick to dispel any perceived displeasure at the move by tweeting: 'Even though i may not look it in the pics I'm buzzing to be here,enjoyed my 1st day at training and everyone made me feel really welcome, [sic]

'Can't wait for the next few months now!!!'  

The Merseyside club confirmed the signing on their Twitter feed around 10.30pm on Monday, half an hour before the 11pm deadline. 

Speaking to evertonfc.com, Lennon said: 'I'm really looking forward to seizing this opportunity at a club with such a history and with such great potential, too.

'The manager wants to play exciting, attacking football and I'm determined to make a big contribution over the remaining games.'

Everton manager Martinez revealed his delight at securing Lennon for the rest of the campaign.  

'We are very excited as you can imagine,' Martinez gold evertonfc.com. 'Aaron is an addition to the squad that gets you very much looking forward to training. He can have an impact straight away.

'For us, he is someone who can play on both wings with a lot of power and a lot of pace. He has incredible ball control on top of that. Aaron is someone who I think will fit in really well at Goodison.'

Lennon is eligible to make his debut against Liverpool on Saturday, and Martinez believes that Everton supporters should feel excited to have the pace forward's talents on board at Goodison Park.

'Our fans will see a player who can take people on and be really exciting,' Martinez added. 

'Aaron is one of those players that gives you the impression that something is going to happen. From that point of view we are thrilled to welcome him to Everton. We are looking forward to seeing how much he can enjoy his football here, which is the real priority from our point of view. 

'You always look at this sort of player at Goodison to bring a real sense of anticipation once they get on the ball. The excitement that they produce is quite unique. I know that the fans will be very keen to see how quickly he fits in with our players and our way of playing.

'I am sure that every Evertonian will agree that Aaron is someone with an incredible pedigree and knowhow, and can have an impact. It is so important to have that experience behind you when settling into a football team like ours and as I say, I think he is ready to create big afternoons at Goodison.' 

Mauricio Pochettino hasn't used Lennon regularly - the English winger hasn't played since December

Lennon had appeared to be heading to Hull City, but the Tigers' woeful form led to a cooling in the winger's interest.

Stoke City were also keen to sign Lennon, who has been capped 21 times by England, but Martinez appears to have won the race for his signature.

The signing will be Everton's first of the transfer window. The Merseyside club have, however, sold Samuel Eto'o and Hallam Hope, and loaned out youngsters Chris Long and Mason Springthorpe.
