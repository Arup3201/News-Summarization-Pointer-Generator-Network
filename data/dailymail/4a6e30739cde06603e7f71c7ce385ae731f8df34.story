The infamous resort of Magaluf may be less than 12 miles away, but, as last night proved, royal 
holidays on the Spanish party island of Mallorca tend to be more sedate.

The Spanish 
royals enjoyed the cultural side of the Balearic island in the beautiful city of Palma for dinner last night.

Queen Letizia of Spain, her husband King Felipe and his mother, the former Queen Sofia, attended an official reception at the Almudaina Palace in Palma de Mallorca last night.

Royal night out: Spanish King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia and former Queen Sofia arrive at the Royal Palace of La Almudaina in Mallorca, Spain

Dressed in a stylish one-shoulder white crepe dress, the 41-year-old showcased her summer tan as she walked arm-in-arm with her husband along the cobbled streets in the pretty capital.

The mother-of-two bared her toned legs in a pair of strappy gold sandals and wore her hair in its trademark loose style.

Still so in love: The Royal King and Queen walked arm-in-arm as they arrived to meet locals and authorities at the Palace in the cultural centre of Palma

Stylish, as always: The 41-year-old Queen looked chic and elegant in a white knee-length dress and gold strappy sandals as she navigated the cobbled streets

Sofia of Spain, 75, looked younger than her years showcasing some serious style credentials in a floral co-ord and wedged sandals.

The Royal trio were in good spirits as they greeted people during a meeting with local authorities and businessmen in the city centre.

The Spanish royals, who have a house in Mallorca, spend most of the time on their yacht, Fortuna, and the 
rest enjoying private dinners or wandering through the winding streets 
of the pretty Mallorcan capital.

Stylish ladies: Sofia of Spain opted for a colourful co-ord while Letizia played it safe in chic white

Family night out: The Royal trio looked smart and chic as they enjoyed a night out in the city centre of Palma

Night off: The couple's two young daughters stayed at home while the loved-up husband and wife enjoyed a night out

Combining work and pleasure: The royal pair are expected to travel to other parts of the island with Pollença in the north and the wine-growing town of Felanitx among likely destinations

Although,
 unlike the Queen's summer residence Balmoral, the Marvient is publicly 
owned, the royals' Mallorcan holiday is considered family time and 
rarely do visiting heads of state get to see inside.

One
 group of visitors who did get to see inside, however, were the Prince 
of Wales and the late Princess Diana, who joined the Spanish royals for a
 holiday in Mallorca in 1988. 

While 
Queen Letizia and King Felipe won't be getting a visit from the British 
royals this summer, they will be spending time with their daughters and 
splashing around in the sea.

Although
 a visit to Magaluf is unlikely, the royal pair are expected to travel 
to other parts of the island with Pollença in the north and the 
wine-growing town of Felanitx among likely destinations.

Elegant: The stylish Queen is yet to make a fashion faux pas and has fast become the most trend-setting Royal in the world
