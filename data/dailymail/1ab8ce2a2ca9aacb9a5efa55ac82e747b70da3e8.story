Top Gear presenter James May has been spotted at the BBC where he is believed to have been in talks with creative director Alan Yentob.  

The pair were seen laughing and chatting as they walked outside the BBC headquarters in Portland Place, London, where Mr May was stopped by a passer-by for an autograph.

The BBC declined to say what the meeting between the two was about. But it comes just days after Mr Yentob said he hoped Richard Hammond and May would stay at the corporation following the sacking of co-host Jeremy Clarkson - who was today seen taking delivery of a new Mercedes.

Top Gear presenter James May has been spotted at the BBC where he is believed to have been in talks with creative director Alan Yentob 

The BBC declined to say what the meeting between Mr Yentob and Mr May was about. But it comes just days after the BBC chief said he hoped Richard Hammond and May would stay at the corporation following the sacking of co-host Jeremy Clarkson 

The pair were seen laughing and chatting as they walked outside the BBC headquarters in Portland Place, London, where Mr May was stopped by a passer by for an autograph 

Mr Yentob said that, although he hoped the pair would stay on the show, he admitted the trio were 'very attached'.

He also told the Media Show that it was 'perfectly natural' for the pair to have reservations about continuing Top Gear without Clarkson.

He said: 'It's perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached.

'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what's going on and where they think the programme needs to be.'

He added: 'The question of what happens next for Top Gear is a conversation which must go on between the controller of BBC2 Kim Shillinglaw, between Andy (Wilman - producer of Top Gear) and the team.' 

Clarkson, who was dramatically dropped from the BBC following an investigation into a 'fracas' with a junior producer, seemed relaxed if a little fatigued as he made his way from his home in west London to a waiting cab before a new car was delivered to his home.

Detectives have since said they have a duty to investigate 'where we believe an offence might have been committed' and experts claimed the Clarkson, 54, may be charged with actual bodily harm for his punch-up earlier this month

It appears Jeremy Clarkson has decided to take it easy after what must have been a tiring few weeks, sporting a slightly unkempt look as he left his home today

Sources have told MailOnline that ITV are prepared to offer him £10million to sign for the trio, with Clarkson's executive producer and schoolfriend Andy Wilman having reportedly met with them. 

Top Gear’s replacement in the Sunday 8pm BBC 2 slot this week was Caribbean with Simon Reeve.

The show got an average of 2.58million viewers peaking at 2.78m, compared with Top Gear's average of 5.5million this series.

BBC director general Tony Hall sacked Clarkson, 54, after an internal inquiry found he had launched an ‘unprovoked verbal and physical attack’ on junior producer Oisin Tymon, 36. 

The row broke out after the star complained no hot food was available at the Yorkshire hotel where the TV crew were staying after a day’s filming. 

Detectives have since said they have a duty to investigate 'where we believe an offence might have been committed' and experts claimed the Clarkson, 54, may be charged with actual bodily harm for his punch-up earlier this month.

But Tymon's lawyer, Paul Daniels, issued a statement in which he said: 'Mr Tymon has informed the police that he doesn't want to press charges.

The BBC has hired bodyguards to protect Lord Hall around the clock after he received a death threat for sacking Clarkson

He was pictured today being followed by security as he made his way to work at the BBC headquarters

The bill to licence fee payers for extra security is expected to run into thousands of pounds after a menacing email to Lord Hall, apparently from an obsessive Top Gear fan overseas

'The events of the last few weeks have been extremely unpleasant for everyone involved. The matter has taken a great toll on Oisin, his family and his friends.

'Quite simply, Mr Tymon just wishes to return now to the job at the BBC he loves, as soon as possible. Further, the BBC have, in his view, taken action with a view to addressing the issues at hand.

'Mr Tymon agrees with the BBC's stated view that all parties should now be allowed to move on, so far as possible.' 

The BBC has hired bodyguards to protect Lord Hall around the clock after he received a death threat for sacking Clarkson.

He was seen arriving with his security detail still in tow at the BBC headquarters this morning.  

The bill to licence fee payers for extra security is expected to run into thousands of pounds after a menacing email to Lord Hall, apparently from an obsessive Top Gear fan overseas.

But Scotland Yard insisted the threat was not considered grave enough to warrant diverting its own officers to guard Lord Hall.

Scotland Yard has said police were investigating an allegation of threats to kill Lord Hall made via email. 

A spokesman added: ‘Inquiries are ongoing to establish where the email came from. At the moment we think it was sent from abroad.

‘We do not have any officers guarding him. The security is being organised by the BBC.’
