A beauty blogger with a very steady hand has recreated the atmospheric poster from the new Star Trek film - using one of her eyelids as a canvas.

Sahily Perez, a fashion and beauty blogger from South Florida, created the look because she liked the aesthetic of the poster - despite the fact she is not a fan of Star Trek.

Writing on her website, Pretty In Pigment, Sahily said: 'To be quite honest, I’m not a fan of the series or the movie, but I did find the movie posters to be very inspiring for a make-up look.

She added that this week she had decided to 'travel into the future', creating the look inspired by the Star Trek Into Darkness poster.

'My creative juices kicked into 
overdrive and I created an extravagant look for my Star Trek Into The 
Darkness inspired makeup look,' she wrote. This is not a wearable look, but rather a
demonstration of artistic ability.'

it is not the only film that has inspired Sahily to pick up her make-up brush either.

She has previously created a glamorous Great Gatsby look, a colourful Monsters University look complete with Mike the monster clinging onto a flick of eyeliner, and a zombie-look inspired by comic book Walking Dead.
