Child porn: Pundit Ross McFarlane, pictured, downloaded the images four months after he was convicted

A Sky Sports commentator has been spared jail after he viewed child pornography for a second time just four months after he was last in court.

Former professional golfer Ross McFarlane, 52, was an occasional pundit for the TV channel - where chiefs, unaware he had any convictions at all, have said he will never appear again.

He used two computers to search for images of children as young as seven, despite a court ordering his internet use to be restricted

Police were alerted by the tracking software installed after his previous offence, which found he was viewing photos of adults having sex with children.

He had been convicted of making indecent images of children in March 2012 and was handed a two-year community order and a Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

A fixture on Sky viewers’ screens 
since 2001, McFarlane initially denied he had been looking for child 
porn and said he had accessed legal porn websites.

But in
 a second interview he admitted accessing the images and 
said he was very down and depressed as he was going through a divorce.

'The searches he had made included pre-teen models and drunk teens,' said Graham Smith, prosecuting.

When police searched his home late last year, they found another, untracked laptop with more pornographic images.

Graham Smith, prosecuting, said: 'In July 2012 officers became alarmed due to the nature of the websites he was accessing.

'In October whoever was using the 
computer was searching out indecent images and in November they (the 
officers) seized his laptop.'

Aylesbury Crown Court heard the websites included references to teens and young girls.

Most of the photos were of girls as young as seven who were scantily-clad but not nude, but some were of child sex, the court heard.

Mr Smith said of the 162 images found on the monitored HP laptop, 132 were at level one, the least severe, with one at level two, 17 at level three and 12 at level four.

On the second laptop were 23 images at level one and two at level three.

McFarlane became a professional golfer in 1979 and won the Deutsche Bank Open of Europe in 1997, his only European Tour tournament win. That year he achieved his highest ranking of 26th on the tour.

His father Noel played for Manchester United’s youth side in the mid-1950s which featured many members of the Busby Babes side, killed in the Munich air crash in 1958.

Mitigation: McFarlane told police he had been depressed about going through a divorce

In mitigation, Helen Warren told the court: 'He is horrified to find himself here and is extremely upset, not just for himself but for those that know him.'

She said McFarlane, dressed in a beige Hugo Boss jacket, black trousers and a white shirt, had sought rehabilitation and counselling since his arrest.

'He is very ashamed of himself and what he has put his family through,' she added.

'His employer was previously unaware of these proceedings so he does not think he will have a job for much longer.'

Judge Johanna Cutts told McFarlane: 'This is not a victimless crime. They are children Mr McFarlane, children. They are abused and photographed to gratify men like you.

'You have children. How would you like it if they had been treated like this?'

McFarlane, of Stoke Poges, 
Buckinghamshire, admitted making indecent images and breaching his 
five-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

Watched by his ex-wife, he was handed 10 months' jail, suspended for two years, given a 10-year order banning him from contact with children under 16 without parental permission and monitoring and limiting his internet use.

He was ordered to sign onto the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years. He was also ordered to pay £340 costs.

A spokesman for Sky Sports said it had been unaware of either of McFarlane’s convictions and added that he had been used 'sporadically', around 10 times per year.

'Ross was an occasional, freelance golf expert and, of course, he will not be appearing again,' he said.
