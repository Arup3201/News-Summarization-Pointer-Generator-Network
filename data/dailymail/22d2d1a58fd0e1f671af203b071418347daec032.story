In a move away from the traditional pomp and ceremony that has surrounded Apple launches in the past, the tech giant has almost silently started selling its new iPad mini.

Apple’s online store went offline early this morning -  a move the company always makes before adding a new product – before coming back online selling the second-generation 7.9-inch tablet.

Recent reports claimed supplies for the iPad mini were ‘ridiculously tight’ and Apple may have released its new device stealthily to avoid a rush on the product.

Apple's web store went offline briefly this morning before reappearing with the new iPad mini, pictured, listed. The California-based tech giant announced last month the 7.9-inch tablet would be released 'sometime in November' but at the time didn't specify a date. This release came, unusually, with no warning

Screen size: 7.9-inches

Resolution: 2048 x 1536

Pixels-per-inch: 326

Camera: 5MP rear-facing, HD rear-facing

Basic storage: 16GB

Price: From £319

Apple’s latest iPad mini is the first 7.9-inch tablet to come with a high-resolution Retina display.

According to figures from analytics firm IHS, shipments of the new iPad mini were expected to fall below 4 million units.

Apple shipped around 8.9 million of its first-generation iPad minis earlier this year, and even this wasn't enough to satisfy demand.

IHS iSuppli predict demand for the new tablet will exceed 9 million, meaning two-thirds of customers could end up being disappointed.

The problem was blamed on limited production of the new Retina display. Larger iPads and MacBooks, for example, have had Retina displays for years and the technology is said to be much more expensive than the traditional screens.

Recent reports claimed supplies of the new iPad mini would be 'ridiculously tight' because of the costs involved in making this screen. It is thought Apple released the second-generation device quietly to avoid a rush on the product

The new 2,048 x 1,536 resolution screen is said to cost 'substantially more' than the 1,024 x 768 version in the original mini, according to analysts.

The 16GB and 32GB iPad mini's, pictured, will take between one and three days to arrive. While the larger devices - 64GB and 128GB - will take between five and ten days to arrive

Apple unveiled the iPad mini with Retina display at the same time as the iPad Air towards the end of October.

The larger model went on at the start of November, but Apple wouldn’t commit to a sales date for the mini.

CEO Tim Cook simply said the smaller tablet would go on sale ‘sometime in November.’

This is unusual for Apple. The firm prides itself on having queues out of the door the day products are released, and they’re usually accompanied with a strong marketing campaign.

According to Apple's online store, the 16GB and 32GB iPad mini’s with Retina display will take between one and three days to arrive.

While the larger devices - 64GB and 128GB - will take between five and ten days to arrive.

There does not appear to be an in-store collection option.

Prices for the new iPad mini start at £319. The tablet has a 7.9-inch screen and is fitted with a faster A7 chip introduced on iPhone 5s.

Apple claims the tablet boasts 10 hours of battery life, comes with improved Wi-Fi and better LTE support.
