George Osborne's Treasury knew about the EU's demand for an extra £1.7billion for almost a week before David Cameron was told.

As the Prime Minister vowed not to pay the sum by December 1 and demanded answers about how it was calculated, it emerged junior ministers were aware of changes to the way the UK bill was calculated months ago.

Labour today said the government's story was 'unravelling day by day', as Denmark's prime minister insisted that 'countries must follow the rules as they are'.

David Cameron has raged against the shock demand for an extra £1.7billion, but it has since emerged that the Treasury knew about the imminent bill for at least a week 

Mr Cameron has reacted with fury to the demand by the EU, which sees some countries like Greece, Italy and the Netherlands paying more while Germany and France are in line for rebates.

The PM interrupted a summit on Friday to demand answers about why the bill had been sprung on him without notice.

Budget commissioner Jacek Dominik revealed that the Treasury was informed of the £1.7billion bill on October 17.

He warned that the UK was obliged by law to pay by this deadline and would be liable for 'late payment fines' if it failed to hand over the cash.

Mr Dominik said he was 'surprised' by the PM's reaction, insisting that the adjustment of Britain's contribution to the EU budget - known in Brussels jargon as 'own resources' - was a routine annual procedure about which London was well aware.

The figures behind the calculation were provided by the UK's Office for National Statistics and the UK was informed on October 17 of the scale of the surcharge being demanded, he said. 

Senior British diplomats were in talks in Brussels today on the massive bill, and Chancellor George Osborne is expected to raise it with fellow EU finance ministers including Germany's Wolfgang Schauble in the margins of an OECD forum in Berlin tomorrow.

Mr Cameron secured agreement at last week's European Council for the issue to be discussed at a scheduled meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels on November 7.

But Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt played down the prospect of the EU making exceptions in its budget rules to assuage British anger.

Ms Thorning-Schmidt told the Bloomberg news agency: 'I respect that the UK wants to discuss this among ministers, but there are rules that must be kept. Countries must follow the rules as they are.'

New figures reveal the increased bill the UK faces, on top of the £8billion-a-year it already pays, is higher than any other EU country, because its economy has been growing faster than expected. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels

Treasury minister David Gauke was informed of the sum at a meeting on October 14, but Chancellor George Osborne says he was not told until October 21

March 11: Then-Treasury minister Nicky Morgan says the government is giving a 'high priority' to addressing concerns about impact of new economic measurements which impact on Britain's contributions to the EU

April 14: Farming minister George Eustice attends meeting of agriculture ministers. Minutes from the meeting referred to changes to the way contributions to the EU budget are calculated

October 14:  Treasury minister David Gauke is told the UK will have to make a significant extra contribution, but no sum discussed

October 17: UK officials informed by the EU that £1.7billion was required

October 21: George Osborne is told about the new bill from the EU

October 23: David Cameron is informed about the sum, as he is driven to a Brussels summit in an ambassador's car

In March Nicky Morgan, then a Treasury minister, then-Treasury minister Nicky Morgan said that the Government was giving 'high priority' to addressing the impact of the changes.

Today it emerged that Farming Minister George Eustice attended a meeting of ministers in April.

The minutes of the meeting referred to the changes to the methodology, in particular a report by the European Court of Auditors entitled 'Getting the Gross National Income (GNI) data right: a more structured and better-focused approach would improve the effectiveness of the Commission's verification'.

The meeting on April 14 agreed that the process of checking the economic data of member states 'must be undertaken in the spirit of mutual trust and transparency'.

It also urged that 'special attention should be given to the reliability' data compiled for changes under ESA 2010 rules which could see Britain paying even more from 2016.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggested the items were not discussed at the meting attended by Mr Eustice, but it emphasises that the issue was put into the spotlight at European Council meetings earlier this year.

Chris Leslie, Labour's chief secretary to the Treasury, told MailOnline: 'Day by day the story that nobody knew until the last minute is unravelling. The Treasury certainly heard about this when David Gauke attended the Ecofin on October 17 which doesn't tally with the Chancellor and Prime Minister's story on this.'

He said the fact that the changes had been on the radar for months 'should certainly call their competence into question'.

European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has said the demand for an additional payment should not have come as a surprise to Britain as member states' contributions were adjusted in this way each year in the autumn.

'Sometimes countries have to give more money. Sometimes they receive much more money,' he said.

'I understand the concerns in London, but any person that wants to look at it with objectivity and honesty to the rules that were approved by the member states, has to accept that sometimes these decisions do happen.'
