It appears the Ennis effect may be rubbing off on the golden girl's compatriots.

Lawrence Okoye, Great Britain's discus hopeful, has qualified in fourth in the men's discus after recording a whopping 65.28m throw - just moments after Ennis posted a picture on Twitter of the pair together.

Okoye and Ennis stand arm in arm next to fellow Team GB athlete Carl Myerscough. The two giant field competitors dwarf the petite heptathlete as they posed before Danny Boyle's opening ceremony.

Queen of the track: Jessica Ennis paraded her medal with a crown on her head after her heptathlon triumph

Ennis cruised to a heptathlon gold on
Saturday after she won the 800 metre event to secure her victory, and 
as she continues to revel in her glory she posted a picture of her and the
humungous GB duo.

Some of her good fortune and talent appears to have rubbed off on Okoye, and the 6ft 4in discus thrower qualified in fourth into the final of his event this afternoon.

After Okoye flung a mammoth throw, the young Briton went berserk on the field, roaring in jubilation at a throw which secured his place in the final of the discus.

Ennis tweeted her support to Okoye afterwards, and said: 'Go on Lawrence!! Brilliant throw!!!'

Before the Games began Okoye was considered to have an outside chance of landing a place on the podium, and with more to come from the 20-year-old he is in with a chance of mimicking his friend Ennis's golden success.

Myerscough unfortunately bowed out of the shot put after a disappointing start to the Games, only managing to qualify in 29th place despite being the British record holder.

The two athletes dwarf Ennis in the photo she posted on Twitter earlier today. Both are well over the six foot mark, with Myerscough standing at 6ft 7in and weighing in at 24st - no wonder the heptathlete looks so small.

While Okoye vies to replicate Ennis, the heptathlon winner has been putting in a number of media appearances enabling her adoring fans to see her recently acquired gold medal.

Yesterday Ennis was at Westfield and Hyde Park showing off her medal.

The 26-year-old won gold on a momentous day for British athletics, as Mo Farah (10,000m) and Greg Rutherford (long jump) won another two gold in track and field events.

Team GB racked up an incredible eight gold medals on 'that Saturday', their best in an Olympics since 1908.
