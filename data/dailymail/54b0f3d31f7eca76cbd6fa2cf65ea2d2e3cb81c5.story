A six-year-old boy accidentally shot a 12-year-old girl to death this weekend with a pellet gun.

Marina Rybak, of Delta Junction, Alaska, was shot in the neck at a Saturday birthday party after the unidentified six-year-old fired the gun by mistake, officials said.

The boy did not know the gun was loaded and was bringing it inside when the weapon went off.

Dangerous: Though it is not clear if it was a shotgun-style or pistol-style pellet gun, an air rifle similar to this one may have been the culprit

‘When he pulled the trigger, he didn't realize the girl was in front of the muzzle,’ a trooper dispatch said.

Taken to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, Ms Rybak died just after 9pm, Alaska State Troopers told the Anchorage Daily News.

The pellet gun was owned by a relative and was given to the boy without the knowledge of an adult, according to an AST spokesperson.

‘The six-year-old was taking the gun back in the house when he pulled the trigger,’ the spokesperson told KTUU. ‘He didn't know the gun was loaded.’

Children ran inside to tell the mother what had happened, she ran out immediately and made the horrifying discovery, reports said.

It is not clear if criminal charges will be filed in connection with the death.
