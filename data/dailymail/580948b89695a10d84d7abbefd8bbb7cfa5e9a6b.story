Rising fast: Cupcakes are growing in popularity among sweet-toothed yet time-poor Brits

Once, no classic afternoon tea was complete without a plump slice of Victoria sponge.

These days, you are more likely to find a single muffin or cupcake on your plate.

Britain’s taste in cakes is changing with individual treats like muffins and cupcakes more popular than the Victoria sponge, researchers say.

New research by consumer analysts Mintel reveals that volume sales of small cakes - 139 million kilograms in 2012 - have now overtaken large cakes (116 million kilograms last year).

Analysis of the UK cake market reveals that volume sales of small cakes grew by 19 per cent between 2011 and 2012, to reach a market value of £492million in 2012.

However, things have gone a little stale for large cakes, with volume sales shrinking by three per cent over the same two year period - down from 120 million kilos in 2011 to 116 million kilos last year, with a market value of £390million.

And it seems there is further scope for growth in small cakes, as today, nearly one in four Brits who eat or buy cakes say they would like to see more cake sold in individual portions.

Emma Clifford, senior food analyst at Mintel, said: 'The proliferation of sharing formats in other categories such as chocolate confectionery and biscuits has spurred cake manufacturers into action, with new product development in small cakes easily dominating the market.'

'The fact that the market share of small cakes - such as muffins and cake bars - has now exceeded that of the larger variety, reflects the role smaller cakes have forged in modern snacking lifestyles.'

While over the past couple of years Brits have gone crazy over cupcakes, the new research reveals muffins are now getting a slice of the action.

Over the last two years, sweet muffins have enjoyed the sweetest growth rate in the cake and cake bar sector, with a 55 per cent volume increase.

Ms Clifford added: 'The rapid growth in volume sales for sweet muffins can be partly attributed to the prevalence of mini muffins tapping into the bite-size trend and sharing occasions.'

The study also found Brits are increasingly turning to baking their own cakes at home.

Home baking in general seen a revival, driven by the economic downturn and the popularity of TV cooking shows such as The Great British Bake Off, with market value up by 59 per cent between 2007 and 2012 to reach an estimated £1.7billion last year.

However, despite the high popularity of cakes - just six per cent of Brits haven’t eaten a cake or cake bars in the last six months - health concerns and cost reasons remain high on the public agenda.
