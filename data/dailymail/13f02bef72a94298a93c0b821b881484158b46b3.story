Thousands of eco-activists piled into Wall Street today in protest over links between financial institutions and climate change.

The environmental campaigners dressed in blue and hoped to 'flood' the lower Manhattan financial district with their message, the day after more than 100,000 joined a climate change march through New York City.

Three of their number were arrested by the NYPD, and officers had to use pepper spray on the crowds to stop them pushing past metal barricades to keep them away from traders at the New York Stock Exchange.

Some protesters were pictured clashing with officers over the barricades, and later being dragged off - while many others sat down in the street and waved banners to get their message across.

The 'Flood Wall Street' protest has roots in the Occupy movements that started in a downtown Manhattan park in 2011 to protest what it called unfair banking practices that served the wealthiest in America, leaving behind 'the 99 per cent'.

'Flood': Many of those protesting wore blue to make a visual statement while marching on the stronghold of capitalism

Concern: An activist dressed as a polar bear to warn of the dangers to some species from rising temperatures

'Fossil fools': Protesters, some of whom wore makes, attacked fossil fuel industries such as oil and fracking

Kai Sanburn, a nurse from Los Angeles, 60, said she had traveled to New York for Sunday's march and wanted to do more.

She said: 'Marching is wonderful but to really change things we really need to change things'.

'The action here against Wall Street is really expressive of the feeling that corporations and capitalism no longer serve people.'

Urban farmer Ben Shapiro from Youngstown, Ohio, says he came to 'confront the system.' 

March: Protesters began in Battery Park, NYC, and continued along Broadway in the financial district

Standing guard: Hundreds of police were posted to Wall St to keep the financial centers working as usual

Getting steamed: NYPD officers stand at the barricades and await the protesters

Scuffles: Three activists were arrested during the day, while others clashed with police trying to force back metal barricades

Flood Wall Street organizers said they hope Monday's action will draw a link between economic policies and the environment.

They accused top financial institutions of 'exploiting frontline communities, workers and natural resources' for financial gain.

The event is part of Climate Week, which seeks to draw attention to carbon emissions and their link to global warming, and it comes ahead of a United Nations Climate Summit tomorrow.

Shall not be moved: One protester lay down in the street with an Occupy-style mask placed on his body

'Carbon bubble': The organizers brought along props - including a metaphorical 'Carbon bubble' - to make their point

Bubble burst: Police seized the bubble and deflated it during the protest today, in which 2,600 are thought to have marched
