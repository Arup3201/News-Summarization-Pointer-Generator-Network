With her latest album on course to achieve record-breaking first week sales, Taylor Swift has removed her entire back catalog from the popular music-streaming service Spotify.

While the 24-year-old singer underwent a promotional frenzy last week to promote the release of her fifth album, one place where fans couldn't hear 1989 was on Spotify.

Now the singer has gone even further and removed all her songs including current single Shake It Off, which had been the most streamed track on the service in the U.S., the U.K. and globally.

Taylor Swift has removed her entire back catalog from the popular music-streaming service Spotify - just as her record label boss is attempting to sell his business

In a statement posted on Spotify’s website, the company said it was trying to get the hit maker to change her mind.

‘We love Taylor Swift, and our more than 40 million users love her even more – nearly 16 million of them have played her songs in the last 30 days, and she’s on over 19 million playlists.

‘We hope she’ll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone. 

'We believe fans should be able to listen to music wherever and whenever they want, and that artists have an absolute right to be paid for their work and protected from piracy. 

'That’s why we pay nearly 70 percent of our revenue back to the music community.'  

The decision may have been instigated by Swift's record label, reports Billboard. Big Machine Label Group is up for sale and a source said the decision to leave Spotify was aimed at driving up the sales price.

'Big Machine is in the process of selling itself, and that can't be forgotten here. [They're looking to] increase the multiple for the sale of that company. [Owner] Scott Borchetta is a very old-school thinker. He's wrong,' said the source.

It isn't unusual for major artists to wait a while before releasing new material to the streaming service - Coldplay, The Black Keys and Beyoncé have all withheld their latest albums in a bid to encourage greater first week physical sales.

Swift's last album, Red, didn't make it onto Spotify until eight months after it was first launched. 

More unusual is the singer's decision to remove her back catalog from the service, while her older albums currently remain available on rival Beats Music, which is owned by Apple.

In the past Spotify has drawn criticism from some artists who claim it doesn't pay them enough in royalties.

Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke withdrew his project Atoms for Peace from Spotify in 2013 and launched an angry Twitter tirade over its royalty rates.

'Make no mistake new artists you discover on #Spotify will no get paid,' he posted. 'Meanwhile shareholders will shortly being rolling in it. Simples.'

According to the latest Spotify figures, the service has ten million paying customers and 30 million free users.

According to Billboard, 1989 is on course to beat Britney Spears' record sales week for a woman. 

In 2000, Britney sold 1.319 million copies of Oops! …I Did It Again according to Nielsen SoundScan.

Industry forecasters predict Swift could have sold over 1.3 million copies by November 2.

Billboard reveals that 1989 is also set to earn the largest sales week for any album since 2002, when Eminem's The Eminem Show sold 1.322 million in its first full week on sale.

All will be revealed on November 5, when the album's official debut week sales figure, as formulated by SoundScan, will be announced.

The album will be Swift's third consecutive album to sell more than a million copies in its first week, making her the only act ever to earn three million-selling weeks.

The Seven-time GRAMMY winner announced The 1989 World Tour on Good Morning America, which will kick off on 20 May, 2015 in Louisiana, USA.

The 1989 World Tour will encompass eight countries and span four continents including North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. 

Spotify announced on Monday that Swift had pulled her entire back catalog from the service and posted a playlist of songs as a plea to the singer to return
