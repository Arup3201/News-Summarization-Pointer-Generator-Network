A Connecticut woman who didn’t know she was pregnant gave birth to a baby boy weighing over nine pounds in her home’s driveway on Saturday.

Jennifer Scollin of Seymour says she was feeling fine up until a few days before the birth, but even then she believed it was just stress at work or a bad stomach bug.

She soon discovered the truth when her water broke and the baby came so fast that paramedics at the scene didn’t even have time to leave their parking place.

'Two pushes and he was out': Cole Michael Thomas Dillman weighed 9-pounds, 3-ounces and was born in his family's Connecticut driveway

'I didn’t know I was pregnant,' she told CT Post. 'I had been feeling fine until the past few days and I had been getting my "womanly thing" every month until last month.'

Scollin has a 4-year-old daughter named Kelsey with boyfriend Matt Dillman. When she woke up Saturday in serious pain, she called Dillman and he rushed over from his nearby job.

'He was going to drive me to the hospital, but we had no chance to do that,' Scollin said. 'We didn't know at first it was a baby coming, but once we did, it happened fast.'

They called 911 when they realized what was happening. Once the paramedics arrived, her labor was almost over.

According to the CT Post, Scollin could barely walk out to their ambulance.

The baby would arrive before it could even pull away.

'Two pushes and he was out,' she said.

Cole Michael Thomas Dillman was born a healthy 9lbs, 3oz.

The couple went to an area hospital, where Scollin remained for observation. Dillman called Scollin's parents Tom and Joanne as he returned home.

'We arrived minutes after the birth,' Tom Scollin told CT Post. 'I was alarmed, shocked to be told by my granddaughter that her mom had a baby boy.'

The shock subsided with time and a little explanation from the equally surprised mom.

'My daughter said, "Dad, I didn't know,"' he said.

As many proud parents do, Dillman and Scollin proudly posted pictures of their new arrival on social media, where reactions weren't your 'congratulations.'

'I'll tell you all about it on Monday,' Dillman told a barrage of some 30 shocked but happy Facebook friends. 'I need to tell work.'
