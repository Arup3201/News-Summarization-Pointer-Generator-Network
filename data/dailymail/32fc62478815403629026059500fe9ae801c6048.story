A well-known male panda living in Taipei, Taiwan, has failed to complete his most important job of the year because he was distracted by an apple.

When Tuantuan's long-term mating partner, Yuanyuan, was in heat last week - a precious window lasting about 72 hours every year - and Taipei Zoo went to great lengths to entice them to mate naturally.

Determined: To celebrity panda Tuantuan, an apple is much more attractive than his long-term girlfriend Yuanyuan who, was on annual heat last week

But the food they used to guide Tuantuan into position ruined the plan, as the 10-year-old male ditched his  girlfriend and leapt towards the apple, according to People's Daily Online. 

Despite the fact that Yuanyuan repeatedly lifted up her tail, a sign to show she was in heat, Tuantuan changed direction and went for the apple dangled in front of him.

Female pandas are generally only in heat once a year for one to three days. 

In order not to miss Yuanyuan's heat period, Taipei Zoo decided to obtain sperm from Tuantuan through an operation. Yuanyuan was artificially inseminated twice the same night.

Gift: The two pandas were given to Taiwan from mainland China in 2008 as a diplomatic present. Their combined name 'tuan yuan' means reunion in Chinese

Stardom: The pair landed in Taipei in December 2008. Thousands went to the zoo to welcome them and millions more watched the event on television

A spokesman from the zoo said they will discover whether the inseminations were successful in about three months.

The two pandas were given as a gift to Taiwan from mainland China in 2008. Their combined name 'tuan yuan' means 'reunion' in Chinese. 

The two became parents for the first time when a baby girl cub called Yuanzai was born in summer 2013.

The pair have become local celebrities. The zoo allows up to 19,200 visitors to the pandas section every day and all visitors are asked to enter a lottery in order to get in.
