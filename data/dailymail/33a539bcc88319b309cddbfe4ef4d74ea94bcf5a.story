A University of Michigan fraternity has sparked outrage after its brothers planned a 'racially and sexually offensive' party dubbed 'World Star Hip Hop Presents: Hood Ratchet Thursday.'

The event, planned by Theta Xi, was advertised in a Facebook invite with a picture of a black man holding a wad of cash and said things like 'we goin back to da hood again!!' and 'hood IDs will be checked.'

After fielding numerous complaints from offended students, the university has cancelled the November 7 bash, which requested 'bad bitches, white girls, basketball players, thugs and gangsters' to attend.

The students said the invitation parodied black culture and offended women, referring to twerking contests, calling females 'bad bitches' and repeatedly using the word 'ratchet.'

U-M officials sent out an email Thursday morning reprimanding the fraternity for the planned event and stating that the school plans to sanction the fraternity and offer educational forums, according to Mlive.com.

'The language of the invitation and theme of the party denigrated all women and African American/black identified people through racial stereotypes and cultural appropriation,' the school's Vice President for Student Affairs E. Royster Harper said in an email.

'This behavior is offensive, disrespectful and unacceptable at the University of Michigan. It is unhealthy and harms everyone in the community. It is in direct contradiction to the values, policies and expectations of the University and will not be tolerated.'

As well as cancelling the party, the national fraternity headquarters has imposed social restrictions on Theta Xi pending a full investigation.

The university said the fraternity would be offering an apology but as yet it hasn't commented.

'Disturbingly, negative stereotypes and misogynistic behavior are woven into popular culture today. We believe this reinforces the ongoing need to continually pay attention to diversity and engage in thoughtful, challenging conversations about social identities,' Harper added in the email.

'It is our expectation that significant learning for the campus community will emerge from these offensive actions. We are in the process of planning educational forums.'

Secretary for the Black Student Union LSA junior Geralyn Gaines told MichiganDaily.com she felt 'complete and utter disgust' when she saw the invite.

Gaines said she was particularly offended by the use of the term 'ratchet,' which she says is used to describe something terrible or someone who can't handle themselves.

She added it was the first time she's personally experienced racism on campus or felt specifically targeted.
