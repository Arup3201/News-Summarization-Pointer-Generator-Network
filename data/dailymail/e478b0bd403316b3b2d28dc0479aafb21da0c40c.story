Police investigating the murder of a wealthy Indian businessman-turned-politician have arrested his son in connection with the killing, according to reports.

Deepak Bhardwaj, leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party, was shot dead by two men at his house in Delhi two weeks ago and four men, including the alleged killers, were arrested soon after.

This morning his son Nitesh Bhardwaj was also called in for fresh questioning over the killing of the 62-year-old real estate developer.

He has previously answered police questions in relation to the murder.

Police said a dispute over property could be the motive, but rumours reported by local media suggest the politician's relationship with a younger woman could have also soured family relations.

According to police sources, Mr Bhardwaj had an extra-marital affair with a 28-year-old who worked for him which had created a rift between him and his family members, reported Mail Today, MailOnline's Indian sister title.

'The idea that he was in an illicit relationship, that too with a woman 33 years younger to him, was unbearable for his family members and they started staying away from him,' said the source.

Mr Bhardwaj was shot dead on March 26 - the eve of the Hindu festival Holi - at his Delhi home, in a crime which has left India horrified.

The former BSP candidate for West Delhi Lok Sabha seat was shot once each in the chest and back of the head by two men deep inside his 35-acre farmhouse-resort in South Delhi's Rajokri area.

Three men entered the complex at 8.55am in a dark grey Skoda, killed Mr Bhardwaj, and sped away at 9.14am. Their entry and gun-waving exit were captured on a CCTV camera.

So confident were the killers of making a clean getaway that they went directly through the CCTV-monitored KM 24 Toll Plaza in the direction of Jaipur minutes after their dramatic exit from the scene of the crime.

The arrest of Mr Bhardwaj's son in connection with the crime, which many have speculated was a slickly planned hit, is just the latest twist in the investigation.

A police source revealed last week that previous questioning of Mr Bhardwaj's sons Nitesh and Hitesh had brought to light the family dispute over the politician's alleged affair.

The woman, named only as Sonia, is a 
resident of Rajouri Garden, an upmarket suburb of West Delhi, but is 
originally from Kanpur, Mail Today reported.

She used to handle accounts in Mr Bhardwaj's Greater Kailash-based office and was reportedly very close to him.

When his family members got to know of his closeness with her, they stopped living with him, the police source said.

Nitesh, in particular, was said to be very upset with his father, whom he was very close to.

With declared assets of more than £71million, Mr Bhardwaj was the richest candidate to stand for parliament in India's 2009 general elections.
