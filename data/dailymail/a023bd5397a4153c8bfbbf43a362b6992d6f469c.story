For Yorkshire, the honour of hosting the start of the Tour de France presents a unique opportunity to showcase its beautiful countryside and historic towns.

With hundreds of thousands of visitors expected to be in ‘God’s Own County’ next weekend for the Tour’s first two stages, what  better chance for the local tourist industry to show off that famous Northern welcome.

But not everyone is so thrilled with the imminent arrival of the world’s biggest cycle race and the huge influx of visitors that entails.

Stunned locals have been warned that the Tour could bring with it a crime wave at the hands gangs of thieves. Residents are being urged, among other measures, ‘to consider digging a trench’ across their driveway to stop criminals with vehicles gaining access to their land.

The warning, circulated on the internet and by email, also claims the area’s low crime rates could be ‘decimated over a couple of days’ unless action is taken.

The first two stages of the Tour de France – dubbed the Grand Départ – are being held in Yorkshire on Saturday and Sunday before the race moves on to London, bringing in millions of pounds of extra revenue for local businesses.

However, the controversial email – attributed to Harrogate neighbourhood watch chairman Keith Roberts and Sergeant Bob Chambers of North Yorkshire Police – warns that ‘with the significant increase in numbers of visitors and enthusiasts there is evidence that there will be many criminals amongst them’.

It continues: ‘Our enviable record of the lowest level of criminality could be decimated over a couple of days unless we can support our police.

‘The amateur thief can gain access to your property if doors or windows are left unlocked or open – keep them locked even if you are at home.’

And ‘rural members’ have been told thieves with vehicles could steal quad bikes and other valuables. ‘If it is feasible do consider digging a trench across points of entry or creating other obstructions,’ the email advises.

North Yorkshire Police last night insisted the warning was written solely by Mr Roberts, 74, a retired company director, who said yesterday that he stood by the advice.

But John Blackie, the leader of Richmondshire District Council, which covers an area of the Yorkshire Dales on the race route, slammed the email as ‘bonkers’.

He said: ‘It’s one of the most unfortunate emails I’ve heard about in 20 years as a councillor.

‘I hope that everybody simply disregards it because all we want to do is welcome the very large number of visitors who are coming here not to steal, not to vandalise, they are coming here to have a really good time.

‘We could do without this kind of bilge and scaremongering, it is absolutely bonkers.’

A spokesman for Yorkshire Grand Départ said: ‘We are not expecting marauding gangs of thieves.’
