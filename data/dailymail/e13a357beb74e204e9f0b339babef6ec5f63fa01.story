How very typical of Mario Balotelli. Rather than taking a moment to settle into his new surrounds and provide a few anodyne words, Liverpool’s latest signing had to make a statement.

First came Balotelli’s tweet ‘YNWA! COME ON LIVERPOOL!’ that he published at 4.58pm, two minutes before his new employers had planned to formally announce his acquisition, but then, more significantly, came his message to Liverpool’s official website.

Balotelli would not be described as someone who regularly courts the media. He barely gave an interview during his first spell in the Barclays Premier League with Manchester City, and was hardly a frequent orator when he returned to Milan.

Done deal: Liverpool completed the £16million signing of frontman Mario Balotelli from AC Milan on Monday

1 - Balotelli has made only one assist in the Premier League - but what an assist! 

The frontman set up Sergio Aguero’s goal that won City the title in 2012.

But here was a glimpse of his ambitions. Having been given a hero’s welcome when he arrived at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground - he was besieged again on Monday, as he was on Friday night and Saturday afternoon - the 24-year-old revealed his desire to win the ultimate prize.

‘I always start a competition wanting to win it,’ said Balotelli. ‘I want to win another Champions League for sure, because the Champions League (he won with Inter Milan in 2010) wasn’t all mine, I was in a team. I want to take this team to the Champions League.

‘I’m happy to be back because I left England and it was a mistake. I wanted to go to Italy but I realised it was a mistake. English football is generally better. English football is beautiful. Liverpool are one of the best teams here. The football is very good. It’s a great team with young players, and that’s why I came here. I’m very happy. We’ve been talking about coming here and I’m happy to be here.’

If Balotelli is going to be remembered for his achievements at a premier football club, rather than as maverick with a knack of attracting unnecessary headlines, this is his last opportunity to make his mark. His agent, Mino Raiola, said as much on Saturday when Balotelli was completing his medical and his new manager Brendan Rodgers made that clear to him when they met, as well as to Sky’s cameras before Monday night’s game at the Etihad.

Perhaps, though, that quote about wanting to win the Champions League is a sign that beneath the stories of fireworks in bathrooms and the urban tales of coming out of casinos to hand money to tramps, there is a footballer who is ambitious and hungry. 

Balotelli has a C.V. that would be the envy of most - as well as a Champions League, he has won titles in Italy and England, plus an FA Cup - and it could be that he has finally found the right place to realise his ambitions. As he travelled to Manchester in a club people-carrier on Monday night, with five of his new team-mates including Adam Lallana and Jon Flanagan, it would not have taken him long to realise he has joined a hard-working group committed to sustained improvement.

‘When I first played three or four games with Inter Milan, when I was young, I had No 45 because the numbers for young players were from Nos 36 to 50. I took No 45 because I was joking that four plus five is nine - and I scored in all four games. It brings me luck and that’s why I’ve always kept No 45.’

He watched the game from the directors’ box after being introduced to those players who had been selected for the crucial fixture and then travelled back with them on the team coach, to begin preparing for what could be his debut at Spurs on Sunday.

Whether he will be unveiled to the media before then has yet to be decided, but Balotelli has the charisma and personality to be a Liverpool player. The question remains as to whether he has the application to fit into the group Rodgers has built.

‘I didn’t expect (to get such a warm reception) because I’ve always been playing against Liverpool,’ said Balotelli, referring to the scenes outside Melwood. ‘Whenever I played against Liverpool, the fans weren’t nice with me but that’s normal - it’s football!

‘Now that I play for Liverpool, I can see the expectation in people. They’re very happy and that makes me very happy. When I meet the team, start training and start my first game, I will realise (that I have signed for Liverpool).’

And when he walks around Melwood and sees the fifth European Cup Liverpool won in Istanbul nine years ago, he will appreciate he has a platform to realise his lofty ambitions.
