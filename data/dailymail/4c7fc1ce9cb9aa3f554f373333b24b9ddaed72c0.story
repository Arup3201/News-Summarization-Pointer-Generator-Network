Justin Rose hopes to emulate Phil Mickelson's success last year as he looks ahead to next week's Open at Hoylake.

Mickelson memorably lifted the Claret Jug at Muirfield, just one week after his victory at the Scottish Open.

Rose believes the confidence gained from that triumph at Castle Stuart inspired the American to win his fifth major championship.

High hopes: Justin Rose hopes to land the Scottish Open this week and then The Open next week

At the double: Phil Mickelson triumphed at the Scottish Open in 2013 before going on to win The Open (R)

Now the 2013 US Open winner, who was victorious in his last outing a fortnight ago at Congressional, wants to repeat Mickelson's back-to-back heroics as he prepares to take on a tough field in Aberdeen this Thursday before heading to the Royal Liverpool links course.

'I looked to what Phil Mickelson did last year,' Rose told Sky Sports News.

'He wouldn’t have been the classic Open pick but the confidence he would have gained from winning the Scottish Open and then carrying it to Muirfield really caught my eye.

'I took inspiration from Phil’s schedule from winning there and going on to win the Open.'

All smiles: Rose was victorious at Congressional two weeks ago and wants to keep that winning habit going over the coming days as he approaches The Open at Hoylake

Mickelson will be at Castle Stuart to defend his title with Rose also up against the likes of Ian Poulter, Rickie Fowler, Lee Westwood, Luke Donald and Rory McIlroy.

'It is a strong field that's been assembled,' he added.

'I've tried to play links courses and playing a tournament links course a week before the Open can only be good for how you start to see shots and you get your touch and shot selection under pressure.'

Practice range: Justin Rose took to the tee at Trump Scotland in preparation for the Scottish Open on Thursday

Three's a crowd: Rose played nine holes at Trump Scotland on Tuesday with Swede Johan Carlsson (R) and Scotland's Stephen Gallacher

Rose, meanwhile, was joined by Swede Johan Carlsson and Scotland's Stephen Gallacher as the trio treated golf fans to a masterclass at Trump Scotland to celebrate the first anniversary of Taylor Made's SLDR driver.

The Englishman, 33, played nine-holes to complete his preparation for Castle Stuart where he tee-off on Thursday alongside Gallacher and compatriot Westwood.
