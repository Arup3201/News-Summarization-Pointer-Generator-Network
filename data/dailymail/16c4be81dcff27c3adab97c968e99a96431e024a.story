AFTER more than two weeks of  glorious sunshine and searing temperatures you would be forgiven  for thinking you were in the Mediterranean.

But Britain will be back in familiar territory this week with the arrival of thunderstorms and heavy rain.

Forecasters warned ‘violent’ storms will strike across the UK, bringing the longest heatwave in seven years to an abrupt end.

Keeping cool: A group of girls jump off the pier to keep cool in Brighton  -tomorrow the mercury is expected to hit 35C for the first time since 2006

The Met Office issued a yellow weather
 warning over the whole of England and Wales for tomorrow and Wednesday,
 fearing heavy rain flowing over parched ground could lead to flash 
flooding.

But before Britain needs to reach for 
its raincoats and umbrellas, there will be one more day of glorious 
sunshine to bid farewell to the dry conditions.

Today could see the highest 
temperatures of the warm spell so far, with the mercury predicted to 
rise to 33C (91F) in the Midlands or the south of England, topping the 
32.2C recorded in London last Wednesday.

Nearly record-breaking: Despite the prolonged heatwave, temperatures tomorrow are unlikely to top the high of 36.5C recorded in Surrey in July 2006

It is also expected to be extremely humid, with warm air moving into Britain from Spain and France.

A ‘big change’ however is expected 
tomorrow as the warm, humid air that has been covering Britain clashes 
with an incoming cold air front, leading to thunderstorms and lower 
temperatures.

It had been thought that this July 
could be one of the driest on record, with Met Office figures revealing 
only 4.9mm of rain had fallen across the UK.

But the heavy storms expected across 
the UK are set to cause a washout, with up to 50mm of rain falling in 
short periods of time.

Meteogroup forecaster Brendan Jones 
said: ‘A large part of England could see temperatures of up to 30C (86F)
 today and for most of the country it will be a dry day, which is 
particularly humid.

Showers and storms are on the way after the longest heatwave in seven years

‘So while 33C would be about a degree higher than the hottest temperature so far, it will feel even warmer.

‘It is going to be sticky, oppressive and close, and will make things feel quite uncomfortable.’

He added: ‘There could be a few thunderstorms around but they will be isolated, then tonight will be the start of a big change.

‘Throughout the night and into the day
 the rain showers will become more widespread, particularly in England, 
eastern Wales and southern Scotland.

‘Some areas will see impressive 
thunderstorms with torrential rain and lightning. And because the rain 
is falling on parched ground it will just run across the surface.’

Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers 
said: ‘We’ve issued a yellow weather warning for Tuesday and Wednesday 
because up to 50mm of rain could fall in a very short period of time, 
which could lead to flash floods.

Endurance: Army reserve recruits taking part in a cross country run exercise in the Pentland Hills, near Edinburgh, testing their skill in how to survive out in the field on one of the hottest days of the year

‘It’s the same pattern for the rest of
 the week because of low pressure, but there will be some sunshine and 
temperatures in the mid-twenties. Towards the end of the week the 
showers should clear up and be accompanied by sun, but temperatures 
won’t be as high as they have been in the last week.’

Despite the deluge of rain, temperatures will still remain warm on Tuesday, with potential highs of 30C (86F) in the East.

Temperatures will then fall gradually towards the mid-twenties over the rest of the week, which is above average for July.

Retailers will be particularly sorry to see the end of the heatwave after reporting a huge spike in sales of sun-related items.

Heath fire: Sunbathers were forced to flee a beach in Poole, Dorset, as a fire breaked out close to where they were lying. Firefighters said the blaze was a suspected arson attack

Department store John Lewis said that 
sales of air conditioners rose by 2,100 per cent last week, while picnic
 hamper sales rose by 320 per cent.

Beaches across the UK have also been left with only standing room as families flocked to bask in the unusually warm weather.

Thousands of pounds’ worth of broccoli are being thrown away, after a cold spring followed by hot weather  created a glut that can’t be sold.British farms are seeing three times as much of the vegetable as normal, but with supermarkets already expecting to sell 400 tonnes this month alone, there’s little demand for the surplus.Farmer Matt Gedney is set to lose £20,000 after harvesting an extra 14 tonnes a week on top of his usual six tonnes on his 70 acres in Southfleet, Kent. He said: ‘Most people view broccoli as something you have in the winter with warming meals like a roast dinner.’

But the fortnight of high temperatures
 has also had an adverse effect on the country.

The longest spell of 
heat in Britain since 2006 triggered a spate of wild fires in London, 
mountain blazes in the Welsh valleys and forest fires in Fife, Scotland,
 as well as prompting a surge in the number of people attending hospital
 with breathing difficulties, heatstroke and dehydration.

The heatwave is thought to have caused 760 premature deaths, mainly due to heart attacks triggered by the high temperatures.

Gritters even took to the roads in Hampshire over the weekend to spray a fine stone dust to prevent the tarmac from melting.

Council staff trying to beat the heatwave have been banned from wearing flip-flops to work.

Bosses at Plymouth City Council told 
workers they needed to dress more conservatively, and ruled that turning
 up in the open-toed summer shoes was out of the question.

Unions claimed staff are having to work in uncomfortably hot offices.
