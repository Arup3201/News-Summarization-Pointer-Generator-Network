Everton boss Roberto Martinez felt his side showed great character to secure a 1-1 draw with FK Krasnodar that he believes will serve as a 'very good lesson' for them.

The Toffees were second best for much of the Europa League Group H clash at the Kuban Stadium.

But they emerged with a point after veteran striker Samuel Eto'o - the ex-Anzhi Makhachkala player, back on Russian soil - notched a late equaliser.

Roberto Martinez was delighted that Everton managed to salvage a Europa League draw in Russia

Eto'o stabbed in Leighton Baines' cross in the 82nd minute to cancel out Ari's 43rd-minute goal for the hosts, who created the bulk of the chances and came close to making it 2-0 when substitute Wanderson hit the bar in the second half.

Having seen his team achieve what he described as an 'incredible result', Martinez said: 'Today gave us a lot of experience.

'It has been a very good lesson for us.

'I think anything you can get away from home is a positive.

'But Krasnodar played really well.

'I thought we couldn't find our attacking rhythm in the first half.

'In the second half, Romelu (Lukaku, a half-time substitute) helped us.

'I think in the end we deserved it.

'I was delighted with the character that we showed.'

He added: 'I thought Krasnodar adapted well in the first half, better than us, and probably we then finished stronger.

'Maybe a draw is a fair result, but Krasnodar did have a lot of chances they couldn't take and it could have been a different story.' 

 Martinez admitted before the game that he had tried to make the most during his preparations of the knowledge of Eto'o and Everton's former Spartak Moscow winger Aiden McGeady about Krasnodar - a club only formed in 2008.

Both players came into the team among five changes the manager made ahead of Sunday's Premier League trip to Manchester United.

Eto'o, 33, has not only tasted Russian football before, he has a vast experience playing in European competition.

And of the three-time Champions League-winner, Martinez said: "Today was a bit of an unknown and we needed the experience.

"Samuel was waiting for that moment, was very composed, he got in good pockets of space and the finish was of the highest quality. I was delighted for him.

"The big thing about Samuel Eto'o is experience in European competition, and if anyone was going to have a chance and score a goal, it was going to be him.

"That was his role today - he used his experience and know-how.

"He came up with the goal and that is why he proved his value.

"I couldn't be prouder of his performance in terms of showing how to wait for your moment and then using it."

Everton, who are having their first European campaign since 2009/10, now have four points from two Group H games and remain top of the pool.

Krasnodar and Lille have two points apiece, while Wolfsburg - defeated 4-1 by Everton last month - have one.
