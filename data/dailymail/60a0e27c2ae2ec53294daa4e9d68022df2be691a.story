Swimming legend Ian ‘Thorpedo’ Thorpe faces losing the use of his left arm after developing an infection in hospital, friends fear.

The five-time Olympic gold medallist – who has battled depression – requires round-the-clock medical care after picking up the bug following a shoulder operation.

It has reportedly become so bad that close friends are concerned he will no longer be able to use his left arm – denying his admirers the chance to ever see him in the pool again.

The 31-year-old Australian had undergone surgery for a shoulder injury near his home in the Swiss town of Ronco sopra Ascona, according to Sydney’s Channel Seven television network.

Australian swimming hero: Five-time gold medalist Ian Thorpe is in an intensive care ward in Sydney, and close associates are gravely concerned for his welfare

He was flown home for further 
treatment at a Sydney hospital where he was last night said to be being 
treated with large doses of antibiotics.

It is not clear exactly where he picked up the infection.

Last
 night, his manager James Erskine said his condition was ‘serious but 
not life-threatening’. He added that Thorpe may not swim competitively 
again.

The troubled star’s latest crisis comes after he was admitted to rehab in February, suffering from depression.

In
 recent years, his life appeared to be in turmoil, with questions about 
his sexuality – he has denied rumours that he is gay – and claims he 
used performance-enhancing drugs.

Before
 the 2000 Olympics, the head coach of the German team accused him of 
cheating, insisting his physical attributes were symptomatic of steroid 
use.

Surgery complications: A report in Sydney's media claims that the swimmer contracted a 'bug' after surgery that threatens the use of his left arm

A hospital-acquired infection usually first appears three days after admission to a hospital or other health care facility.

The infection, which can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites, may develop from surgical procedures, catheters in the urinary tract or blood vessels or from material in the air which is inhaled into the lungs.

These micro-organisms may already be present in the patient's body or come from the environment, contaminated hospital equipment, healthcare workers or other patients.

Common hospital infections are MRSA and C Difficile.

Sometimes the infection can have devastating results and require a limb to be amputated, if the infection cannot be treated.

Some of the common causes of infections are when the hospital: Fails to carry out routine pre-screening for MRSA or C-Difficile prior to surgery; delays in identifying and treating the infection when it has been acquired; fails to treat or monitor the infection appropriately, to provide basic medical care and post-surgical treatment or a clean and safe environment.

This was followed 
seven years later by claims in a French newspaper that he showed 
abnormal levels of two banned substances in a doping test.

But
 the freestyle specialist was cleared of suspicion when the Australian 
Sports Anti-Doping Authority dismissed any suggestion of wrongdoing.

Thorpe made an ill-fated attempt to compete at the 2012 London Olympics, struggling in the trials.

He told reporters afterwards: ‘The fairytale has turned into a nightmare.’

Thorpe’s
 manager, James Erskine, told the ABC in February: ‘He made the decision
 [last year] that he would give up competitive swimming. There is plenty
 of things to do in life after swimming. He loves cooking, travel, and 
is a natural for television.

‘[He needs to find something that will] give him the same type of satisfaction [as swimming].

‘There
 wouldn’t be an Australian who is living today who hasn’t got the pride 
and joy of seeing Ian Thorpe swimming and winning gold medals, and who 
wouldn’t wish him well,’ Mr Erskine added.

The
 nightmare continued away from the pool. In his 2013 autobiography, This
 Is Me, he confessed he had battled ‘crippling depression’ for more than
 a decade.

He told how he had considered suicide and had been drinking huge quantities of alcohol to deal with his pain.

Yet
 he was determined to continue swimming and hoped to be picked for 
Australia’s Commonwealth Games team to compete in Scotland this year.

But then came the shoulder injury and he had to concede his career was over.

In
 February, he sought help after being found outside his parents’ home in
 Sydney, disoriented from a combination of antidepressants and 
medication for the shoulder complaint.

Now
 the man whose power left the competition behind in the pool faces one 
of his biggest  challenges – recovering from the infection that has left
 his friends so worried.
