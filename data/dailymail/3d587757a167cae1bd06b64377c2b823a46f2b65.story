Suicide: Anna Sargent jumped off a bridge into the Thames while suffering withdrawal from a drug she found on the internet

A PR executive leapt to her death from a bridge over the Thames after becoming dependent on a powerful drug she was taking to tackle her alcoholism, an inquest heard today.

Anna Sargent had come across baclofen online when she was trying to find a way to get over her addiction to alcohol.

But despite being treated at the exclusive Priory clinic, she was unable to deal with the drug's withdrawal symptoms and killed herself while in a depressive spiral.

Ms Sargent, 36, was last seen alive on September 18 last year when she left Charing Cross Hospital in Hammersmith, West London, where she was being treated for severe panic attacks.

Police searched for her after she went missing but were unable to find her until her body washed up on the shore of the River Thames next to Hammersmith Bridge eight days later, West London Coroner's Court heard.

Ms Sargent's parents, David and Margaret, have accused staff at the Priory of mismanaging their daughter's attempts to stop using baclofen, whose withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations, insomnia and confusion.

'Clearly she had to get off baclofen but that led to withdrawal symptoms,' Mr Sargent said. 'When she heard from her consultant that the terrible side effects of withdrawing from baclofen would last for weeks, it caused her to feel more anxiety.

Baclofen is a muscle relaxer and an antispastic agent.

It is used to treat mutiple sclerosis, including spasm, pain and stiffness.

Dr Olivier Ameisen tested the drug Baclofen and was amazed by the effect it had on reducing his drinking.

He called for clinical trials to test his theory which he said suppresses the craving for drink and even wrote a book, called Le Dernier Verre (The Last Glass) which became a bestseller in France.

The drug, Baclofen, appears to suppress the craving for alcohol.

Between 1997 and 1999 he spent nine months in clinics trying everything from hypnosis to acupuncture, without success.

Then a friend sent him an article about how a cocaine user with muscle problems had been cured of his addiction after being prescribed Baclofen.

Two years later he started treating himself with the drug and noticed 'almost immediately' that his desire for alcohol was diminishing.Â 

Dr Ameisen, 55, wrote, 'I detested the taste of alcohol. But I needed its effects to exist in society.'

He said the drug was so effective that it enabled alcoholics to return to social drinking rather than cutting it out completely, which is often the route that counsellors recommend.

However, it has been known to impair your thinking.

You may have withdrawal symptoms such as seizures or hallucinations when you stop using baclofen after using it over a long period of time.

In 2012, it was approved for use in the treatment of alcoholism on a case by case basis.

'She couldn't face more of these terrible effects of feeling anxious and suicidal and she couldn't face life - it is down to baclofen.'

Ms Sargent first suffered from depression as a teenager before graduating from Manchester Metropolitan University and pursuing a successful career in public relations, the inquest was told.

She worked as a press officer at the BBC then became PR manager for Fox Kids Europe and ended up working with law and property firms.

Last September, she took an overdose of baclofen, which was still in an experimental phase, and was admitted to the Priory.

However, her parents claim that staff at the clinic, which has previously treated celebrities such as Amy Winehouse, had failed to inform them of the details of her treatment and did not send a letter of condolence after her death.

A few days after entering the Priory 
Ms Sargent was rushed to A&E at Charing Cross Hospital in the middle
of the night suffering severe panic attacks.

Returning a verdict of suicide, coroner Sean Cummings called on the Priory to improve its communication with patients' families.

'The
medical cause of her death is drowning,' he said. 'Ms Sargent had a 
history of depression for her teenage years and struggled with alcohol 
use and was desperate to stopping using alcohol.

'She
researched online and discovered baclofen had some notoriety for the 
helping of alcohol dependency.

'She eventually overdosed on baclofen and 
was admitted to the Priory for detoxification and on 18 September 2012 
took her own life.

'This has been a very unhappy tale - Ms Sargent was a beautiful girl and she clearly loved her family.'

A former colleague wrote on Ms Sargent's Facebook memorial page: 'I'm still shocked and saddened.

'Anna hid her troubles well from her colleagues and we wish we had realised. We were very fond of her.'

Treatment: Ms Sargent was admitted to the Priory less than two weeks before her death in September
