Fans of Gary Glitter (pictured outside Southwark Crown Court where he was convicted of sexual offences) expressed support of singer in Amazon reviews

Amazon is still carrying glowing reviews of Gary Glitter CDs, with fans describing the paedophile as 'not a vile monster' despite his numerous convictions for sexual offences against children.

Among products for sale on the website are the artist's Greatest Hits album, with 23 customers rating the CD with five stars, the highest possible review on the site.

Most made reference to his chequered criminal past but said it had 'nothing to do' with his abilities or success as a musician. 

One fan even cast doubt over his convictions, writing: 'He would have been massive in America before his "crimes" came to light'. 

The 70-year-old was found guilty of sexual attacks at Southwark Crown Court this month, his youngest victim an eight-year-old girl.

It was the latest in a string of convictions relating to indecency and children, having been jailed for three years over separate incidents in 2006 and tried in court in 1997 after police found child pornography on his computer. 

Among the most supportive comments is one written by a fan calling himself 'R N Smith'. 

It reads: 'Gary glitter is a genius and should have been more popular than Elvis, I believe he would have been massive in America before his “crimes” came to light.

'I personally could listen to his music every day and I very often do.

'I don't believe for one minute that he is this vile monster everyone paints him to be, most of you claim to know so much about what he has supposed to have done and yet hardly anything has ever been published regarding his crimes.' 

Another said they felt sympathy for the paedophile who they had grown up listening to. 

'I am so upset for this guy - yes I know he has gone to places people don’t wish to speak of.

'But I grew up in the Seventies and I thought him the Sweet, Mud, Slade, T rex - Suza Q, Showaddywaddy, etc were great send up fun.

'Do you remember when it was the thing to go to Glasgow and watch the New year GG show ? well I do and went a few times too..... a great night out - what a deep shame... coz it was very very good.'

Among reviews for the singer's many CDs are some which dismiss his convictions for sexual assaulting children

Among comments of support for the musician were others describing him as a 'lowlife'. Many fans acknowledged his convictions but said they should be kept separate from his body of work. 

Amazon has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment on the matter. 

Earlier this month Glitter was found guilty of a string of sexual assaults on children as young as eight.

It comes after the paedophile was first found guilty of possessing child pornography in 1997. After being sentenced to four months imprisonment he fled the UK. 

After settling in Cambodia, in 2002 he was deported to Vietnam having been accused of the rape of a child. 

Three years later he was arrested trying to board a flight to Thailand. Six girls and women, aged 11 to 23, came forward to say they had had sex with the musician.  

Following his conviction of offences this month he was remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on February 27. 

Glitter was arrested in Vietnam in 2006 over the sexual assault of children. Last month he was convicted of more offences in London

The singer was previously convicted of possessing child pornography. Above, he addresses the media at a 2000 press conference over other alleged assaults
