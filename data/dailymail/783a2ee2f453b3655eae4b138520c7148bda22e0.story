A couple have uncovered a mummified cat while carrying out renovation work at their family home.

Melanie and Ian Bruce found the animal under floorboards near the entrance of the property in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, and believe it could have been left there since Victorian times.

They have dubbed the unfortunate feline ‘Tutan-cat-mun’, saying they will keep it in the house - and are even looking into displaying it in a glass case, so visitors can see it when they come in.

Lucky charm: Melanie Bruce believes the mummified cat which she has named Tutan-cat-mun has been bringing good luck to everyone that has owned the house for generations

Mother-of-two Mrs Bruce, 38, thinks 
the cat may have been mummified by a previous owner, who wanted to ward 
off evil spirits - and now believes the dead animal is bringing them 
good luck.

She said: ‘It’s not leaving the house.
Everyone says the house has a lovely feel to it. I think Tutan-cat-mun 
is partly responsible for that. I knew when we found it, we couldn’t 
just put it in the bin.

'We initially placed it in an 
old-fashioned pram in the cellar. Eventually we might place it in a 
glass frame next to the door.

'Or we might put it under the bathroom when we carry out work to renovate that room - back where it came from, so to speak. It’s a huge talking point whenever 
anyone comes to the house. They are mesmerised by it and feel really 
close to it, it’s lovely.’

Purr-fectly preserved: The mummified cat may have been hidden underneath flooring boards in the house since Victorian times but still has its claws, whiskers and teeth in good shape

The cat is remarkably well preserved, with its tail, claws, whiskers and teeth all in excellent shape.

Cats were revered animals in Ancient 
Egypt and important to society and religion, with some of the animals receiving the same mummification after death as humans.

Mrs Bruce, who moved into her home 
three years ago, added: ‘It looks Egyptian to me and that’s why we gave 
it the name. Who knows, it could have come all the way from Egypt on a 
boat.

‘One thing certain is that if we ever 
sell this property, we wouldn’t take it with us. He’s been here bringing
luck to householders all these years. We wouldn’t want to change that.’

One family resident who was initially a
little disconcerted by Tuttan-cat-mun was Sidney, the family’s Jack 
Russell-cross border terrier.

Mrs Bruce: ‘He wouldn’t go into rooms, as if he was afraid, and I thought that’s because of the cat.’
