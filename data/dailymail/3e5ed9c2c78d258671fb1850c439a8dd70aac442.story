A deadly scorpion has been living in a mother-of-two's home for three months after hitching a 9,000 mile lift in her suitcase from Australia.

Carol Cook suffered the fright of her life when she spotted the three inch-critter scuttling through her home.

The 51-year-old is unwittingly thought to have brought the creature back to her home in Stansted, Essex,  after enjoying a three week holiday in Australia at the end of September last year.

Wildlife experts have now identified it as a lethal Bark Scorpion whose sting is powerful enough to kill children and elderly people.

Carol Cook, 51, discovered the Bark Scorpion living in her home three months after returning from a holiday in Australia

Her husband, Gary, 51, bravely scooped their unwelcome house guest into a glass after it made an appearance in their kitchen.

The couple have now nicknamed the creature the 'Beast of Stansted' and it is currently living with them in a rectangular plastic takeaway tub until a new owner can be found.

At one stage they thought the little creature had died only for him to spring back to life when the heating was turned on.

Card merchandiser Mrs Cook said: 'When I saw him I was jumping around screaming and so was my daughter, Billie, but Gary stepped up to deal with it.

The scorpion was believed to have travelled over 9,000 miles in Mrs Cook's suitcase from Australia to her home in Stansted, Essex

'He's the one in house who deals with spiders - it's always been his job since we married so this was one for him to deal with.

'He was quite calm considering what was going on - a lot calmer than me, that's for sure.

The nocturnal critter is considered one of the most dangerous scorpions in the world by wildlife experts

'I've seen the movie The Scorpion King so I know what they are capable of.'

The mum-of-two added: 'We came back from three weeks out in Australia at the end of September and he may well have come back in our suitcase and then just been living in the house.

'It's a real possibility that he is from Down Under as they can survive for a long time without food.

The family have nicknamed the scorpion 'Beast of Stansted' and are keeping it in their home

'It creeps me out to think he has been with us for all that time.

'I have certainly not got friendly with him and he won't be staying here for much longer.'

Wildlife experts believe the light and dark brown scorpion to be an American Bark Scorpion which are commonly found in Florida and Arizona.

Wildlife experts said that venom from Mrs Cook's scorpion' could potentially kill a very young child

Iain Newby, who runs the Dangerous Wild Animal Rescue Facility, said people travelling the world every day made such occurrences very plausible.

He said: 'Everyone travels the world, somebody from America could have gone to Australia.

'Then Mrs Cook comes back to the UK with her new friend - a scorpion can hide in a little tiny two-inch pocket in a briefcase and you would not even know it was there.

'They curl up and they hide, like spiders.'

Mr Newby warned that the scorpion should not be underestimated.

He added: 'If you are under five years old and are stung by it, there's a possibility you are going to die.

The critter has been described by wildlife experts as one of the most dangerous scorpions in the world.

Bark Scorpions are commonly found in the Sonoran Desert in the south west of the United States and Mexico. 

Their venom has been compared to that in deadly snakes and they are considered incredible hard to kill.

They were even found at the site of ground zero after the Twin Towers collapsed. 

They range in size from around two to three inches and are a light colour, so can blend in well with their surroundings.

Unusually they tend to live in large packs and stick to desert regions.

They ambush their prey and then sting it from behind.

Their diet normally consists of roaches, crickets and beetles.

The Bark Scorpions has a lifespan of approximately five years. 

Its venom is said to cause severe pain and in rare cases even death.

The very young and elderly are said to be most at risk from its sting. 

'If you are over 70, there is a possibility you are going to die. If you are fit and healthy, it is going to hurt like bugger.

'It would be like 50 bee stings - you may not die but the hurt is going to hurt.

'I would not mess around with it at all.

'It might even be gravid and it might give birth to live young.'

Mrs Cook said her friends were amazed that the scorpion had been allowed to stay in the house after it was found earlier this week.

She added: 'We're not taking any chances. The lid is on the take-away box and we've just made some small holes in there for air.

'My friends have been saying I must be mad to keep it in the house - especially as they often live in pairs, so I am hoping this one was a loner.

'I did think he had died but as soon as the heating went on, he was back to life.

'He is still very much alive and with us.'

Scorpions are hardy creatures, able to survive in some of the harshest conditions on Earth and were even found at Ground Zero with no adverse effects.

They are found on every continent except Antarctica.

Scorpions are not native to the UK but colonies have been established after the species was introduced.

In all, around 1,750 species of scorpions have been identified. Of these, only about 25 are known to have venom capable of killing a human.
