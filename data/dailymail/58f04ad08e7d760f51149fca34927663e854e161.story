A man has died after being found unconscious in a pool on Surfers Paradise as Schoolies celebrations continue on the Gold Coast.

A Queensland police spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia paramedics had treated an unconscious man who was pulled from a pool at an apartment block on Orchid Avenue.

She stressed it was not a Schoolie but a 29-year-old who was pronounced dead when he was found about 7.40pm on Wednesday.

The spokeswoman added: 'A report for the coroner will be prepared as it is a sudden death'.

It is believed the man lived at the Top of the Mark hotel, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

The man was transported to the nearby Gold Coast University Hospital where he later died.

It was the 29-year-old's friends who had left him at the pool for a brief time before coming back to find him at the bottom and called triple-0.

Police are treating the death of the man as non-suspicious.

A witness, who saw the incident unfold while at a barbecue with friends, told the Gold Coast Bulletin two of the man's friends flung themselves into the pool to retrieve the 29-year-old.

'I helped pull him out of the pool and blood started to come out of his mouth and he was stiff and cold. I was doing CPR,' the witness said.

It is thought the man had not been awake for about 10 to 15 minutes.
