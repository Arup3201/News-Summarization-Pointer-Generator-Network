Manchester United teenage sensation Adnan Januzaj earns more than Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi did at the same age.

The Belgium forward, 19, has burst on the scene at Old Trafford this season; cementing his position as one of the most outstanding young players in Europe.

Januzaj, who was 18 at the time, signed a new five-year deal worth £30,00-per-week in November.

And the player's representative Dirk De Vriese says the deal made Januzal the best paid youngster in world football.

'I can say Adnan's the best paid youngster in the world. He earns more than Ronaldo and Messi when they were 18,' said De Vriese.

And Januzaj advisor has also revealed the teenager turned down a last gasp big-money switch to Paris St Germain ahead of penning his new United deal.

'Five minutes before Adnan signed a new deal at Manchester United, PSG offered us an astonishing deal,' he said.

'As Adnan was a free agent at the end of the season, the Qatari were ready to offer anything. Anything in terms of wages and signing on fees.

'It could have been interesting from a commercial point of view. But money has never been a deciding factor in his choice.'

Meanwhile, manager Ryan Giggs called for
 Januzaj to be given more protection on Tuesday night after the 
youngster was injured in an incident with Hull midfielder David Meyler.

Meyler 
will be waiting anxiously to see if the FA take any action after he 
appeared to deliberately stand on Januzaj's outstretched leg towards the
 end of the game.

If
 referee Craig Pawson confirms today that he did not spot it, then the 
FA will be free to act and Meyler's place in the FA Cup final against 
Arsenal a week on Saturday could be in jeopardy.

It
 is the second time this season that Januzaj has been the victim of an 
alleged stamp after Fulham's Sascha Riether was banned for three matches
 in November after accepting a FA charge of violent conduct.

Hull boss Steve Bruce insisted that he did not see last night's incident, but Giggs described it as 'a joke'. 

The
 United manager said: 'I didn't see it but I've seen his leg. It's the 
second time it has happened to him this season. It's not great to see, 
and it's terrible his leg.

'He
 needs protecting. He's a brilliant, exciting player and the authorities
 need to sort it out. It's just the length of his leg, not cutting into 
his skin. It goes from his knee to his ankle.'
