An historic Chinese vase made for an 18th century emperor has sold at auction for £50,000 - but could have been worth ten times that value had a previous owner not drilled a hole in the bottom to turn it into a lamp.

The centuries-old vase was made for the Chinese Emperor Qianlong, but its hugely important seal of authentication was destroyed when a two centimetre hole was drilled in its bottom to feed an electrical cable through.

The former owner of the antique even customised it with fittings and a garish lampshade, giving it pride of place in his hallway.

But experts believe that if he hadn't have drilled the hole, then the 15 inch tall vase may have sold for up to £500,000.

The vase sold instead for £47,800 when it was sold at Duke's Auctioneers of Dorchester, Dorset.

The bottle vase dates from the 18th century is likely to have been made for the Imperial household.

A relative of the unnamed owner bought it off a London-based dealers at the turn of the 20th century and converted it into a lamp years later.

It was inherited by the last owner who has kept it ever since at his home on the Isle of Wight.

Andrew Mulborough, a specialist in Asian art at Duke's, said he was invited to the property to inspect other antiques when he saw the vase out of the corner of his eye.

He said: 'It was on a floor-standing cabinet in the hallway. I initially thought that it couldn't be original and asked the owner if I could have a closer look.

'As soon as I touched it I knew it was a fabulous piece of Chinese porcelain.

'I was hoping to find an Imperial mark on the bottom of it but tragically there was a hole from where the mark would have been.

'My heart did sink and the joy of finding the vase was equalled to my disappointment.

'Given the sheer quality of the workmanship on the vase, which was top notch, it is highly likely there would have been an Imperial reign mark on it.

'These marks tell you during which reign it was made and also that it was made for the Imperial household.

'The owner told me it wasn't him who made the drill hole. He was a little disappointed but just said that was the way it was.

'I brought it back to Dorchester and very carefully removed the lamp fittings around the top of it.'

The bottle vase was decorated with buddhistic lions in underglaze blue and red, a technically difficult process.

Guy Schwinge, a partner at Duke's, added: 'The irony is that if the vase had not been drilled and turned into a lamp base, it could easily have fetched £100,000.

'If the Imperial reign mark was still intact, the vase would have sold for more than £500,000.'

Ceramics from the Quinlong period are highly-sought after, especially among the newly rich Chinese who are buying back their lost heritage.

In 2010, a pair of Qianlong vases which were given to a couple as a wedding gift and kept on a bedroom shelf as ornaments fetched £500,000 at the same auction house.

Later the same year a blue and white dragon vase from the same era, valued at just £10,000, sold for almost £5million at an auction in San Francisco.

Earlier this year, another vase which was valued at £10,000 to £15,000 sold for almost £1million in Leyburn North Yorkshire.

Emperor Qianlong

Emperor Qianlong was the sixth Emperor of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the fourth Qing Emperor to rule China proper.

He reigned from October 1735 until February 1796 making him one of the country's longest serving emperors.

Qianlong, whose name means 'lasting eminence', was also considered one of the most enlightened of the emperors.

He was an enthusiastic patron of all forms of Chinese art and published catalogues of Royal collections which he expanded greatly.

The Emperor wrote thousands of poems in beautiful calligraphy, was a talented painter and commissioned many magnificent temples and palaces.

During his reign, Qianlong was determined to expand his empire and Tibet became a protectorate, Ili and Turkestan were conquered and Burma and the Nepalese Gurkas acknowledged Chinese suzerainty.

In the last decade of his reign, delegating decisions to others led to an increase in corruption and inefficiency in government.

He officially abdicated in favour of his son in 1796 so as not to rule longer than his grandfather, but ultimately reigned until his death two years later.
