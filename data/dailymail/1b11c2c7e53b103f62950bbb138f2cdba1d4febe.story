Love was quite literally in the air for a stunned woman after her boyfriend proposed - by writing 'Lisa marry me?' in giant letters on a mountain.

Lisa Jenkins, 29, was left speechless when she spotted the 30ft long white message on the Cat's Back ridge in the Black Mountains on the English-Welsh border.

Her boyfriend Chris Knapton, 29, surprised his partner with a plane ride last Saturday  just days before their 10th anniversary.

Love is in the air: Chris Knapton proposed to partner Lisa Jenkins, 29, by writing a 30ft long white message on the Cat's Back ridge in the Black Mountains on the English-Welsh border

The couple flew over their home in Hereford before the four-seater plane headed towards the Welsh border.

Unsuspecting Lisa noticed a white marked in the distance but when the aircraft banked over the 2,00ft high Cat's Back ridge she spotted the words 'Lisa marry me?' on the mountain.

Chris said his new fiancee immediately said 'yes' and burst into tears.

He added: 'It was a dream way of asking the question.

'Lisa hadn't clicked then she saw this white spot in the distance and as we got closer she burst into tears of joy.'

Up up and away!  Chris surprised Lisa with a plane ride just days before their 10th anniversary. The couple flew over their home in Hereford before the four-seater plane headed towards the Welsh border to reveal the sign

Chris, who works in marketing, recruited friends to help lay out the five metre long white lettering and make sure it stayed in place.

He booked the plane trip two months in advance but his plans nearly didn't work out after he woke up on Saturday morning to cloud cover.

Chris was worried haze would block the view to the ground but fortunately the sun came out at lunchtime.

Close shave: Chris booked the plane trip two months in advance but his plans nearly didn't work out after he woke up on Saturday morning to cloud cover, luckily it cleared 

He added: 'It was horrible weather on Friday night but my friends hiked up the mountain early on Saturday and set the letters out.

'Luckily the rain stopped and the clouds cleared just in time for the flight. It was a bit of divine intervention.

'I'm so glad it all came together on the day. It's a day we'll remember forever.'

The couple - who met working at Tesco in Hereford - then told family members about their engagement at a party on Saturday evening.

Chris added: 'There were oohs and aahs from the women but I got scowls from their partners.'

Lisa said: 'I had no idea what was going on until I spotted my name on the mountain side.

'When I realised what Chris had done I couldn't help but burst into tears. Of course I said yes.'

Spotted: Chris and his friends hiked up to the top of the mountain to place the letters, which can just about be made out in the distance
