Phil Jones could be sidelined for up to three weeks with the hamstring injury that he suffered in England’s Euro 2016 qualifying victory over Switzerland on Monday night.

The Manchester United defender  has been assessed by the club’s medical staff since returning from Basle, where he limped off after 77 minutes to be replaced by Phil Jagielka.

There were fears that Jones could be out of action for up to a month, but a scan has revealed that it is more likely to be between two and three weeks.

Jones will definitely miss United's game against QPR at Old Trafford on Sunday - where up to four new signings could make their debuts.

Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind were unveiled as the club's deadline day signings on Thursday and could take a bow with fellow summer arrivals Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo.

Manager Louis van Gaal is still chasing his first Premier League win after a disappointing start that has seen them take only two points from their opening three games while crashing out to lowly MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.
