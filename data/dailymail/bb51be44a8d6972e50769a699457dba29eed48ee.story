He is a man who has never cared about his face, or shown much regard for how he looks.

But it would seem that Keith Richards has succumbed to a sudden bout of vanity and had some dentistry work done.

The Rolling Stone, who turns 70 later this year, has spent years smoking cigarettes, taking drugs and drinking alcohol.

Rolling Stone: There was no sign of the rock-star lifestyle of Keith Richards (left, in his youth) having affected his teeth as he attended a Broadway show in New York on Wednesday night (right)

Yet there was no sign of his rock-star lifestyle having affected his teeth as he attended a Broadway show in New York on Wednesday night.

He showed off a gleaming set of pearly whites backstage at the Al Hirshfeld Theatre where he was watching the musical Kinky Boots.

Wearing a scarf tied around his head and a hoop earring in one ear, Richards looked every bit the aged rocker, aside from the unusually youthful smile.

Richards’s teeth have never been his first
 priority and he once superglued a missing tooth back in his mouth, 
according to his bandmate Ronnie Wood.

But he seems to have had a chance of heart, perhaps in light of the Stones’ upcoming Hyde Park concert, and decided to take a little more care over his appearance.

The gig will be held on July 6 as part of a 10-day series of events called British Summer Time in front of a crowd of 500,000.

Meanwhile, Mick Jagger has bewailed how audiences look ‘glumly’ at him when he is not belting out one of the band's hits.

He admitted to trawling internet message boards seeing demands for the classics and that he does ‘worry a lot’ about not making everyone happy.

After the gig Jagger then goes back on the the web to see the reaction - which tends to be negative unless the fans' favourite song was played.
