A 27-year-old woman wept tears of joy today as she described the moment she was reunited with the mother who left her in a Burger King bathroom when she was just hours old.

Katheryn Deprill appeared beside her biological mother, Cathy Pochek, and her adoptive mother, Brenda Hollis, on the Today show on Thursday morning for their first interview together.

Deprill, who found Kathy after launching a Facebook appeal last month, learned her mother was just 16 when she left her in the Pennsylvania bathroom following a rape that she hid from her family.

After seeing the news stories about Deprill's search, Pocheck contacted a lawyer and the two women met two weeks later. They soon realized they have a long list of things in common - from their names, cars and careers. Bizarrely, Pochek even babysat Deprill's husband when he was a child.

Overwhelmed: Katheryn Deprill breaks down in tears as she describes how she was reunited with her birth mother 27 years after she abandoned her in a Burger King bathroom as a newborn

Together: Deprill found her birth mother Cathy Pochek, left, after launching an appeal on Facebook

'It's so surreal,' Deprill said as she became emotional on the Today show. 'I never in a million years thought this was going to happen so I don't think i necessarily prepared myself for it.'

Of the moment they met in an attorney's office, Deprill said: 'It was very exciting, there were lots of emotions. And it was kind of awkward. I said, "Alright, just give me the hug." That broke the ice.'

Until that moment, something had been missing, she said.

'I have a wonderful family, I would never want to replace them. But being adopted, part of you is missing,' she said.

Pocheck said she had contacted a lawyer to help her meet Deprill because she was worried someone else would take advantage of the situation.

Support: They were also joined on the Today show by Deprill's adoptive mother, Brenda Hollis, right

Emotional: Hollis said she encouraged her daughter to turn to Facebook to find her birth mother last month 

'I was extremely nervous,' she said. 'I had the advantage because I had seen interviews she had done. I was so proud of her, how articulate she was... I was grateful for her mom for the beautiful childhood that she gave her.'

She added to her daughter: 'I'm really glad you came looking for me.'

When the women met, they were also 
overwhelmed by their similarities. They share the same name - Katheryn 
Ann, although spelled differently - both drive the same make and color 
of car, and both work as ENTs.

'She
 actually was the babysitter of my husband,' Deprill added. 'They lived 
in the same town. So she knew my husband before I did.'

Appeal: Deprill posted this image on Facebook on March 2 and it was shared more than 30,000 times

Deprill's adoptive mother, Brenda 
Hollis, said that she had always supported her daughter's desire to 
track down her biological mother.

'She been talking about it for a long time,' she said. 'Never in a million years did we expect this to happen.'

A massive search was launched to find 
Deprill's mother 27 years ago after a customer found the newborn wrapped
 in a sweater and dumped in the Burger King, which is still
 standing in Allentown.

Deprill was about three hours old when she was found and she was adopted by a local foster family.

Investigators dusted for fingerprints, 
searched trash cans, interviewed witnesses and followed up on seemingly 
promising tips - but nothing led them to the mother.

Abandoned: It emerged that Deprill (pictured) was abandoned after her birth mother was raped aged 16

Discovery: She was found on the floor of the bathroom in this Burger King in Allentown, Pennsylvania

She eventually went on to marry, work as an emergency medical technician and have three children of her own.

Deprill began her quest for her mother on March 2, when she posted an image on her Facebook page showing her holding a sign.

'Looking for my birth mother,' it read. 'She abandoned me in the Burger King bathroom only hours old, Allentown PA. Please help me find her by sharing my post.'

The photo was shared more than 30,000 times by Facebook users around the world, and Deprill's story landed in numerous media outlets.

That caught the attention of the woman claiming to have abandoned her, and she came forward to attorney John Waldron, who arranged for them to meet.

Childhood: She was brought up by Brenda Hollis, left, and her husband and always knew she was adopted

Making up for lost time: The two women, who both have families, now hope to stay in touch

She explained that, as a 16-year-old girl, she was raped by a stranger  while traveling abroad with her family and became pregnant.

She said she hid the pregnancy from her parents because she was ashamed and, when she gave birth at home, felt she could not take her newborn to the hospital.

'She left me somewhere she knew I'd be found,' Deprill said. 'She did not want to throw me away.'
