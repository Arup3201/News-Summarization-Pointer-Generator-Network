The mother of a schoolboy who apparently killed himself after being falsely accused of rape has branded the justice system a 'joke' after one of his bullies walked free.

Tom Acton, 16, is believed to have committed suicide following a hate campaign against him which started after he told police about drug dealers plaguing his neighbourhood.

Thomas Greenwood, 18, admitted assaulting the teenager, but escaped jail as he was handed a 12-month community order and 100 hours of unpaid work.

After the victim reported drug dealers in his home town of Poynton, Cheshire to the police, false rumours spread that he had tied a girl to a tree and raped her.

Tom was then targeted in the streets by angry mobs, while vigilantes turned up at his front door saying they wanted to 'get rid of the vermin' - but both his school and the police said they were unable to help him.

He began self-harming and was found critically ill in his bedroom on October 31, just days before he was due to testify at Greenwood's trial, dying in hospital two days later.

The teenager's death was not mentioned during Greenwood's sentencing at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court.

After the thugÂ  - who has not been linked to drug dealing - walked free from court, Tom's mother Gaynor described the punishment as 'bloody disgusting' and said the authorities had let her son down.

Rumours: After Tom spoke out against drug dealers, he was falsely accused of raping a girl

'This sentence is absolutely bloody disgusting but sadly I'm not surprised as I wasn't expecting much more,' said company director Mrs Acton, 45. 'The justice system in Britain is just a laugh and a joke.

'My son is dead because of these people and yet this guy is already back out on the streets walking scot-free. I don't even know how to feel about it. I just feel numb.

'In this world as it stands at the moment it seems it doesn't matter who you are or what you've done, you'll get away with it. It's people like my son, the victims, that end up suffering and paying the price. It's quite simply appalling, I'm lost for words.'

The bereaved mother has previously denounced officials for failing to protect Tom from local thugs after he spoke out against the drug dealers and was then targeted by the false rape claims.

'The rumour went all over the place and on Facebook and Tom went to live with his gran in Wales for a bit,' Mrs Acton said.

'Straightaway I called the school and police but they said there was nothing they could do about it. They said it was just a rumour and that Facebook is their bane.

'Tom became a recluse in his own house. It was horrific. He was screaming and crying asking why were they doing it.

'We would have gangs of 30 coming to my door shouting abuse when me and my family were in the house at around 10pm at night. We didn't feel safe in our home, the kids said they had come "to get rid of the vermin".

'This was a kid being called a rapist and it wasn't true. Tom was never questioned as a rapist or charged, it was the bullies making it up. He couldn't even walk along the road because of the name-calling and violence.'

In June Greenwood attacked Tom outside his home, and threatened him with what the victim believed was a knife.

School: Officials at Poynton High School said they were unable to prevent Tom being bullied

In a statement given before his death, Tom said: 'He grabbed hold of my arms turning me towards him and pushed me into a bush.

'He said, "Tell me tell me." I didn't understand what he wanted me to tell him but he said: "Apparently you strapped someone to a tree and raped them and took pictures." I said, "What are you on about?"

'He threatened to break my nose and said: "If I see you, you are dead." I screamed for my life and I saw him just staring me out. I thought my life was going to end.

'As you can imagine I can no longer walk down the street as everyone calls me a rapist. I felt so scared for my life I wanted to break down and cry. I was scared to go out of the house. I wish I wasn't here.'

In mitigation Greenwood's lawyer Anthony Derbyshire said: 'He did approach Thomas and confront him with regards to the issue as to whether he assaulted one of his friends. He is genuinely remorseful.'
