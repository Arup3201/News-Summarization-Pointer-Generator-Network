Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner has come under fire for posting a racist tweet poking fun at stereotypical Chinese pronunciation during a visit to the country aimed at strengthening relations.

Kirchner, who is facing questions in her own country over the death of a prosecutor who had accused her of helping to cover up a terrorist bombing, replaced the letter R with L in a tweet mocking the accent of the people she was meeting during the state visit on Wednesday.

This resulted in the post, which it appears was supposed to suggest the 1,000 people at the event had only attended for the 'rice and petroleum', reading: 'are they here only for the lice and petloleum?' in an attempt to mimic the Chinese pronunciation.

She seemed to make matters worse when she said 'sorry' and the 'ridiculous and absurd' situation should be 'digested with humour'.

Despite the offensive tweet, Kirchner and Chinese President Xi Jinping signed 15 agreements covering travel visas, information technology, media, energy, space technology and financing. 

They also struck a deal to collaborate on two new nuclear power plants, but the finances of the agreements were not disclosed.

Kirchner said two nuclear plants would be built in Argentina with transfer of technology from China, which is also helping Argentina build infrastructure such as dams and railways.

Her visit came following the death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who was shot  after accusing the President of helping to cover up a terrorist bombing.

This week it was revealed Mr Nisman was trying to have her arrested before his death.

Investigators probing the killing of Mr Nisman – found dead in his bathroom before he could testify about the 1994 attack on a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires – revealed they had found a draft document requesting Kirchner’s detention.

Chief investigator Viviana Fein said the warrant was found in a bin at the apartment where Mr Nisman’s body was discovered on January 18.

It was not included in a complaint Mr Nisman had filed in the federal court days earlier.

The 51-year-old was found slumped in his bathroom with a bullet wound in his head hours before he was to appear before congress to detail allegations that Kirchner agreed to protect those responsible for the bombing, which killed 85 and injured more than 200.

The attack was believed to have been masterminded by Iran, something the country has denied.

Kirchner has rejected Mr Nisman’s claims and has suggested that rogue intelligence operatives were behind the special prosecutor’s death.

His allegations, she said, were based on false information given to him by the former head of the intelligence services.
