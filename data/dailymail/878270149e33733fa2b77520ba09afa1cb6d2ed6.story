Caroline Seeds used to be so scared of heights she avoided going up tall buildings but now she is a trapeze artist

A woman who was afraid of heights has become a solo trapeze artist with a travelling circus.

Caroline Seeds, from Sawtry in Cambridgeshire, used to avoid going up tall buildings and walking over high bridges.

But now, the 27-year-old has conquered her fear by flying through the air nearly 20ft above ground in the big top of Billy Smart’s Circus.

Miss Seeds, who originally joined the
circus as a dancer, now swings from the trapeze at least twice a day.

'I’ve always been scared of heights and avoided going anywhere high, unless I was strapped in,' she said.

'The first time I went up high on the trapeze I was a nervous wreck and very scared. I was shaking so much I fell off.

'But
I love performing so much I have managed to get over my fear of heights
and I’m often so caught up in what I am doing that I forget how high 
above the ground I am.'

Miss Seeds started dancing when she was 11 and attended as many classes as she could including ballet, tap, modern and jazz.

After leaving school she did a Btec in 
dance at Peterborough Regional College in Cambridgeshire, then joined a 
cabaret show in Menorca for two seasons.

When she returned she decided to join the circus after seeing a job to be a dancer advertised.

'I never planned to join the circus, but the opportunity came up, then I met a boy there and although we later broke up, I decided to stay,' she said.

Miss Seeds decided to take on an actual act and her then boyfriend offered to teach her tricks on the trapeze.

'I’d never been on a trapeze before and to start with we practised with it on the ground so for a while it didn’t cross my mind that I would be performing in the air,' she said.

'When it was hoisted into the air, I was so scared I fell off and didn’t try it again for a while.'

But her confidence was boosted when she went to a circus in the Netherlands as a magician’s assistant and practised daily with a flying trapeze troop.

She used a safety harness and suddenly the act didn’t seem quite so scary.

'It helped me get over my fear of heights and after that I decided to learn properly,' she added.

No fear: Caroline's act includes everything from swinging, balancing and even hanging on with her toes

'Initially I was quite weak in my arms, so it took a while to build up the strength required to be able to do it. But now I love it. I feel very free when I’m flying through the air.'

Miss Seeds' act includes everything from swinging, balancing and spinning to jumping off and catching the bar with her arms or legs and hanging on with her toes.

She has fallen off several times, but says someone has always been there to catch her.

The dancer has now got her own caravan at the circus based in Cambridge where Caroline performs

She said: 'My mum is always worried and holds her breath until I’ve finished my act. For the first two years she always sat in the same seat to watch.

'I think they are quite surprised that I have taken up the trapeze after being scared of heights.'

She joined Billy Smart’s earlier this year, and they’ve been touring the country for months. 

When the tour ends in November, Miss Seeds, who now has her own caravan, will spend Christmas working at a circus abroad before re-joining Billy Smart’s in February.
