The mother of two young children who were allegedly choked to death by their father wept in court today as she told of how she had trusted her ex-husband to care for them.

Wiping away tears, Corrine DeBlase said she had given up custody of her daughter Natalie, four, and three-year-old son Chase to John DeBlase in 2008 because she thought he was a 'good father'.

Dressed in a pink top with her hair scraped back, she told the court: 'He was their father, he was supposed to protect them. That's what a father is supposed to do.'

She added: 'Nobody can blame me more than I can blame myself. I know there are things I could have done then. I was their mother I should have done something.'

Tragic: Natalie (left) and Chase (right) were killed in Mobile County in 2010. Chase's remains were discovered in a wooden area in Vancleave, Mississippi in December 2010. His sister's were found just days later

Natalie and Chase were killed in Mobile County, Alabama, in 2010. Chase's remains were found in a wooden area in Vancleave, Mississippi, in December 2010, six months after he was killed.

His sister's remains were discovered in Cintronelle days later. DeBlase, then 27, and his common-law wife, Heather Keaton, then 22, have been charged with murder. They have blamed each other.

Taking to the witness stand today, Mrs DeBlase said she had been forced to give up custody of her 'well-mannered' children after she lost her job and home, and her marriage collapsed.

She said that her ex-husband mainly treated Natalie like 'his little princess', but had once 'popped her in her mouth' when she was suffering from a night terror, according to AL.com. 

On trial: DeBlase (pictured in court on October 22) and his common-law wife, Heather Keaton, have been charged with murder in the killings, which allegedly occurred in Peach Place. They blame each other

Both accused: Yesterday, Brandon Newburn a former cellmate of DeBlase (left), claimed the suspect wrote a series of letters saying he choked the youngsters to 'end their suffering' at the hands of Keaton (right)

She said the last time she had seen her children was November 17, 2009. A year later, she was told the youngsters were missing, Fox 10 reported.

'They were my heart. It may not seem the way they make it look but I loved them so much. I loved them so much and I can’t have no more (kids),' Mrs DeBlase told the court.

Yesterday, Brandon Newburn a former cellmate of DeBlase, claimed  the suspect wrote a series of letters saying he choked the youngsters to 'end their suffering' at the hands of Keaton.

In the 10 letters, DeBlase reportedly said Keaton rained 'tortures and abuse' on his children at their home in Mobile County, Alabama, before finally giving him an ultimatum that it was 'her or the kids'.  

Innocent: Today, Mrs DeBlase said that her ex-husband mainly treated Natalie (pictured at a younger age) like 'his little princess', but had once 'popped her in her mouth' when she was suffering from a night terror

Siblings: Natalie (right) was reportedly killed on March 4, 2010. Her brother (left) died on June 20, 2010

The father also allegedly revealed that Keaton was spiking his children's sippy cups with antifreeze because she wanted to 'break their spirits so they would be more obedient to her will'.

In the hours before their deaths, the stepmother duct-taped and gagged the helpless youngsters, according to the letters, the TV station reported. 

DeBlase then allegedly wrote he 'picked them up in the air and choked them to death... where their bodies hung lifeless,' adding: 'I know what I did was wrong, but she left me no choice.'

Welling up: The grieving mother (pictured speaking to reporters outside the courtroom) said the last time she had seen her children was November 17, 2009. A year later, she was told the youngsters were missing

Lost without her children: 'They were my heart. It may not seem the way they make it look but I loved them so much. I loved them so much and I can’t have no more (kids),' Mrs DeBlase (pictured) told the court

The defense contends Newburn coerced DeBlase and cannot be trusted.

Natalie was reportedly killed at her father's Peach Place apartment on March 4, 2010. Her brother died on June 20, 2010, according to police.

DeBlase's trial continues.
