An African-American family are suing Disneyland after an actor playing the White Rabbit character from Alice in Wonderland allegedly refused to hug or touch their children because of their skin color.

Jason and Annelia Black, of San Diego County, said the person in the rabbit costume also acted impatiently as their young kids posed for a picture at the Anaheim theme park.

The Blacks, however, said it was a different scene when a Caucasian family arrived.

Mr Black told CBS: 'There were two other kids that came up. The rabbit showered them. Hugged them, kissed them, posed with them, and took pictures. Meanwhile, that made my kids feel horrible.'

His son, Elijah, said: 'This white boy, he started hugging him, kissing the girl and hugging the boy and they were white.'

The family immediately filed a complaint with Disneyland officials and were initially offered VIP tickets, which they refused.

The Blacks said Disneyland later offered them $500 and asked them to sign a confidentiality agreement, which they also turned down.

They are demanding a public apology from Disneyland and for the employee involved in the incident to be fired.

Suzi Brown, of Disneyland Anaheim, told Mail Online: 'It would be inappropriate to comment on something that we have not seen. We carefully review all guest claims.'
