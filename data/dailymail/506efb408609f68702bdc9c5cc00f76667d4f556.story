This is the moment a pet dog catches a giant rat in his mouth, amid warnings the disease-carrying rodents are surging in numbers around the UK.

Jack Russell, Max, grabbed one of the extra-large rats during a walk in a park in the Kent town of Royal Tunbridge Wells.

Pest controllers around the country have reported increasing numbers of the over-sized vermin, which are growing as big as cats on fatty foods and developing an immunity to traditional poisons.

The problem had been mainly confined to large cities, but Royal Tunbridge Wells resident Mark Willmott was shocked to see his dog Max emerge from bushes with one the creatures in his mouth during a walk in local park, Southborough Common.

Mr Wilmott, 50, said: 'I've never seen a rat that big in my life. When I saw my dog come out of the bushes with it I was shocked that something like that was living so close to where people live.'

His daughter, Lexie O'Hara, 20, described the rat as 'terrifyingly big'.

It comes as residents in the town report an increase in sightings of the extra-large rodents, with some fearing their numbers could lead to a spread in disease.

Peter Vincent told local paper, The Kent and Sussex Courier: 'Itâ€™s disease. Rats carry everything, absolutely everything.

He added: 'This was the cause of the plague. They killed half the population in Medieval times. We need to get to grips with responsibility with this.'

It has been suggested the rats are using the disused ABC cinema in the town as a breeding ground.

A spokesman for Tunbridge Wells Borough Council played down the claims of an increase in numbers today.

But she insisted the council has moved to tackle any rodents living in the former cinema.

The spokesman said: 'The empty cinema site in the town centre is due to be demolished and we have imposed strict conditions on the owners about how they must use specialist contractors to eradicate, not displace, any vermin before demolition.'

The picturesque spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, near the border between Kent and Sussex, is a popular retreat for wealthy Londoners and is famous for its 'Pantiles' Georgian walkway.

Pest controllers have seen an increase in the numbers of huge rats, which experts say are growing fat on junk food thrown away by humans

The town's rat fears come just days after pest controllers in Birmingham reported more than 5,000 sightings of large rats, some as big as cats, in the past year.

Dr Robin Allaby, professor in evolutionary genetics at Warwick University, has said the increase in size is probably down to high-sugar and fatty foods now thrown away by humans .

He said: 'Humans have got bigger with nutrition and it's a quite likely explanation for rats as well.'

Earlier this year, pest control experts warned that rats are mutating and developing an immunity to tradition poisons.

The pesticides wipe out weaker animals, meaning that those that survive are able to withstand increasing amounts of poison.

David Cross, from pest control firm Rentokil, said the biggest rats still live in rural environments and grow large by eating animal feed meant for bulking-up livestock.

He added: 'Rats, much like the rest of us, are focused on finding food and shelter.

'Once they find a good supply of food and the environment is favourable, they'll end up staying there and can grow to a decent size.

'One way to control the spread of these creatures is to go back to basics and not give them the ideal conditions in which to thrive.

'Simple things like ensuring that food waste is properly disposed of can make a big difference in cutting their food supply, while sealing any obvious holes in the exterior of your property with wire wool or caulk should stop them entering your home.'
