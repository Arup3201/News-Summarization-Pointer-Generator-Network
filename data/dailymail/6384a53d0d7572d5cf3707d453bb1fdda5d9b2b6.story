A pensioner who caught and killed a 'giant rat' measuring 4ft from nose to tail has received death threats from animal rights extremists.

Brian Watson, 67, from Waskerley, County Durham, used a lump of wood to bludgeon the creature on his farm last month.

It was so heavy that he broke a paddle when trying to scoop it up.

Death threats: Brian Watson, 67, from Waskerley in County Durham has been targeted by animal rights activists after this picture of him holding a 'giant rat' he had killed emerged last month

Some observers believe the creature 
was a coypu - a large South American rodent, also known as a river rat 
or swamp beaver, which is bred for its fur.

But the grandfather has now been targeted by animal rights activists who have labelled him a 'murderer' after a photo of him holding the monster emerged.

He told Sky News: 'We've had quite a 
few phone calls and letters off cranks saying I'm a murderer, that it 
should be me that's clubbed to death because they're saying it's a 
coypu.

'I know the difference between a rat 
and a coypu, because I've lived in the country most of my life and it's 
vermin, and vermin should be destroyed.

'Rats carry diseases, that's why they get killed, so you crankers out there, don't waste my time and don't waste your own time.'

He had been made aware of the animal's presence after his granddaughter's boyfriend cried out while mowing the grass.

Some believe the animal was in fact a coypu, a South American rodent bred for its fur

Mr Watson said last month: 'I heard 
him shouting there was a large rat. I came running round the corner. I 
managed to grab some wood on the way.

'It wasn't very fast. I managed to kill it there and then. I've never seen a rat as big in my life before.'

One reason it was quite slow is that it might have been pregnant.

'I think it was due to drop young 'uns,' Mr Watson added.

The incident first came to light when 
Mr Watson's friend, Bri Mitchell, posted a picture of the rodent after 
it had been caught, on Twitter.

Mr Watson said: 'We left it for a few 
days, but word got round so we decided to destroy it and we chucked it 
on the fire and got rid of it that way.'

The RSPCA was last month seeking further information on the incident from members of the public.

A spokesman for the charity said: 'We 
would urge anyone with more information about this incident to contact 
our cruelty line and we will look into it further.'

Mr Watson said today: 'People saying I'm a murderer, that I kill wildlife, I love wildlife.

'I've got wild ducks that come onto 
the lake a breed, at the moment I've got moorhens, I've got fish in the 
lakes and pheasants nesting at the minute.

'I like wildlife, I just do not like vermin.'
