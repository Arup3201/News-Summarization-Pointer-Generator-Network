Figures

Figures such as Mary Seacole will have a greater chance of being chosen to appear on bank notes under a new selection regime unveiled by the Bank of England

More women and significant black figures will appear on bank notes under a new selection regime unveiled by the Bank of England.

Figures such as Mary Seacole, the suffragettes, National Trust founder Octavia Hill or biophysicist Rosalind Franklin will have a greater chance of being chosen.

The decision is a victory for campaigners, including Labour MP, Stella Creasy, who were subjected to threats and a vile hate campaign via Twitter after arguing for a greater place for women on the notes.

In another change, the Bank has decided that it may be possible for a small group of people to feature on the notes under a decision to open up the selection process to public nominations.

Details emerged as the Bank of England confirmed a switch to longer lasting plastic bank notes from 2016 onwards with the introduction of a new £5 featuring the image of Sir Winston Churchill.

A new £10 note will arrive in 2017 using a controversial portrayal of Jane Austen.

The decision to draw up new rules follows pressure on the new governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, to include more women.

A group called the The Women’s Room, had launched a campaign to change the selection process, which they said was secretive, prejudiced, sexist and potentially illegal.

They were particularly critical of the decision to select Churchill to replace social reformer Elizabeth Fry on the new £5 notes.

The bank said the new selection procedure will be based on principles ‘which are inclusive and positively state what the Bank intends to achieve through the depiction of characters on banknotes’.

It said the process would ‘draw more 
heavily on input from the public and on independent experts, and ensure 
that decision-makers consider the equality implications of choices’.

The
 Bank added there would be an effort to make sure that future choices 
‘cumulatively reflect the diverse nature of British society’.

In simple terms this means that the process is more likely to push for the selection of women and people from the ethnic minorities.

Caroline Criado-Perez, co-founder of The Women’s Room, was subjected to astonishing abuse for simply advocating a greater place for women on banknotes.

The abusive tweets began the day it was announced that author Jane Austen would appear on the newly designed £10 note.

She reported them to the police after receiving ‘about 50 abusive tweets an hour for about 12 hours’ and said she had ‘stumbled into a nest of men who co-ordinate attacks on women’.
