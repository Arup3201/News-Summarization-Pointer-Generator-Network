The federal agent who helped bring down Lance Armstrong has been appointed as the UFC's new Vice President of Athlete Health and Performance.

Jeff Novitzky, who was also involved in the investigations into Barry Bonds, Marion Jones and Justin Gatlin, will spearhead the development of the UFC's new drug testing programme.

The organisation announced earlier this year that they will implement a new year-round, out-of-competition testing protocol following a string of high-profile failed tests by Anderson Silva, Nick Diaz and Hector Lombard.

'There is no bigger advocate of clean professional sports than Jeff Novitzky,' UFC Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Lawrence Epstein said.

'When we announced our commitment for an enhanced drug testing program in February, we wanted to ensure that the best people would be helping move this program forward and Jeff will lead the UFC in developing the most comprehensive anti-doping policy in professional sports.'

Novitzky added: 'I am thrilled to be joining a world-class organization like UFC, that is committed to taking the necessary steps to ensure all of its athletes are competing in a clean sport.

'I am confident that UFC will be able to create a new gold standard testing program and implement it so a sustainable and level playing field is provided for all athletes.'
