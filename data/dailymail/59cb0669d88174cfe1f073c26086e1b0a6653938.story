A thief with an unusual foot fetish has been pulling shoes off women's feet at various Brooklyn subway stations, according to police.

The bizarre incidents have all taken place at train stations throughout Brooklyn, New York as the women did their daily commutes.

Several women told police that  the thief approached them and grabbed their shoes right off their feet whilst they stood on the mezzanine and at turnstiles in the subway.

Shoe theft: The bizarre incidents took place in several train stations throughout Brooklyn, New York

Surveillance footage shows the man, who is wearing dark clothes and a black hat, approach the women from behind and take their shoes before he runs away.

The New York Police Department said that two women have already identified the same man as the brazen shoe thief.

And, while the  suspect tends to take the women's right shoe,  he does not discriminate against high-heels, sneakers or flats because he  likes them all, according to the NYPD.

A law enforcement source told The New York Post: 'It’s possible that this guy has a fetish. I guess if the shoe fits!'

The suspect last struck at West 8th Street station in Coney Island at 8:18 a.m. on October 2 when he grabbed a Nike sneaker off a woman's foot as she walked up the stairs to the Q train.
