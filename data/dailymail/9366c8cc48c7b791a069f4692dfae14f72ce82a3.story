Splashing about in the water, playing on the sand, sitting on deckchairs and cooling off from the sweltering heat with the garden hose.

These glorious photographs from the 1920s and 1930s show that while the outfits have changed, many ways of enjoying the sun are still rather similar.

The newspapers showed what life was like in Scotland and the South West of England during heatwaves experienced by Britain almost 100 years ago.

Wet wet wet: The Western Daily Press of Bristol from July 1929 showed youngsters finding 'a new use for the garden hose' and proving that 'you can have a "bathe" without going to the seaside'

They are taken from the British Newspaper Archive and come as temperatures in Britain are expected to hit a seven-year high of 35C next week. The Western Daily Press and Bristol Mirror of August 1935 showed ‘competitors in the Bathing Beauty Competition’ in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.

The women were photographed walking along in a line in modest outfits with the council chairman and local hospital president at Weston Hospital Fete. Another picture from the same newspaper gave the rather bizarre sight of six nurses from Weston-super-Mare Hospital coming down a helter skelter.

And in The Courier and Advertiser of 
Dundee from July 1931, a group of five adults and children could be seen
playing rounders on the beach. The
caption said: ‘An exciting game of rounders, complete with the 
regulation costume - beach pyjamas or bathing costume - on North Berwick
beach’.

The Western Daily 
Press of Bristol from July 1929 showed youngsters finding ‘a new use for
the garden hose’ by bathing 'without going to the seaside’.

It also pictured a group of youngsters around a fountain, ‘waiting their turn' in a 'heatwave scene on Durdham Down’ in Bristol. And the Western Morning News and Daily
Gazette from August 1932 showed the ‘Opening of Salcombe Regatta’ as 
the ‘West swelters in heatwave’.

It
also featured a child playing with a bucket of water in the sand, 
people sitting in deckchairs and children jumping into the water on 
beaches in Plymouth.

The 
same newspaper also showed scenes four years later in August 1936 of 
girls and boys having fun while taking part in a wheelbarrow race. They
were pictured in Perranporth, Cornwall, and their photograph was under 
the newspaper’s headline of: ‘Heatwave frolics on the beach’.
