A man in Las Vegas who signed up for a state-approved health insurance plan in November has now been told that he didn’t have coverage for the first two months of this year even though he was paying premiums for that time.

Larry Basich’s ordeal that has landed him with $407,000 in hospital bills is the latest example of the problems facing Nevada residents due to the state’s problem-riddled exchange system.

On Tuesday, a state panel approved a $1.5million consulting contract in an effort to have a private firm fix the state’s exchange.

Outraged: Larry Basich's heart surgery on January 3 has led to $407,000-worth of bills that his health insurance will not cover because the state exchange claims he is on another plan

Missing pieces: The Nevada 'Silver State' heath insurance exchange has listed Larry Basich, who had triple bypass surgery in January, that he was signed up with a different plan than the one he has been paying since November

Mr Basich comes as a clear example of crossed wires resulting in six-figure bills.

After spending weeks trying to sign up for ‘Obamacare’ when the buggy national website first launched on October I, he purchased a plan with UnitedHealthcare in mid-November.

‘It was like reaching the third level of Doom,’ he told The Las Vegas Review Journal.

He made his first premium payment for $160.77 on November 21 and because that was before the December 23 deadline that the Obama administration put into place, that meant his care was due to be activated on January 1.

Addressing the issue: Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval has inquired specifically about Mr Basich's case multiple times and used hm as an example of the problems with the state system

For Mr Basich, 62, health insurance couldn’t have come at a better time because on December 31 he had a heart attack.

He had a triple bypass surgery on January 3 and the operation combined with its ensuing care led to a total of $407,000 bills for January and February.

Even though he has only ever been signed up for- and been paying bills for- UnitedHealthcare’s MyHPNSilver1, the state exchange somehow lists him as being an enrollee for an alternative plan, run by Nevada Health Co-Op.

'If he had picked our health plan, we would be advocating for a solution. But he didn’t pick us,' Nevada Health Co-Op CEO Tom Zumtobel told the state's exchange board.

The state exchange, which has Xerox as it’s contractor, attempted to right the wrong by saying that they would list Mr Basich as a client of Nevada Health Co-Op for January and February before switching him to UnitedHealthcare in March, but that still wouldn’t solve the issue of addressing the bills from his heart attack.

All the while, Basich continued paying the monthly bills for his insurance premiums in January and February.

'Xerox is truly out of their league. 
They need to understand they are an administrator, they are not an 
insurance company,' Mr Basich's insurance broker Tamar Burch of Branch 
Benefits Consultants said.

'They
 need to understand their boundaries. They don’t understand this world. 
Everybody is at the mercy of Xerox, and they are not doing this right.

'I
 believe Xerox is covering themselves because of a huge system error. 
They don’t want the accountability of saying, "Yes, we did mess this up,
 and here’s the plan you selected." It’s like, "What did he pay for?" 
That’s it. They are making this more complicated than it has to be.’

Working through the issues: The Nevada exchange is now being revamped after the governor approved a $1.5million consulting contract to have their system reworked as a result of the thousands of crossed wires

Mr Basich is not alone, as Ms Burch estimates that more than 20 of her clients have faced the same problem, and other estimates suggest that 22,000 Nevadans have faced various problems enrolling in the federally-mandated insurance plans.

The Las Vegas Review Journal reports that Governor Brian Sandoval has been told by Xerox that they plan to work with Deloitte Consulting, the consulting firm elected to fix their state exchange.

'We should never be here today for this but we are,' he said when Mr Sandoval approved the $1.5million contract.

'We, being the state of Nevada, cannot go through this again.'

Mr Sandoval specifically mentioned Mr Basich's case when he announced the consulting hire on Tuesday, and he wasn't thrilled when Xerox spokesman Greg Vitiello said that they are 'much closer' to finding a solution.

The Governor asked for further clarification 'because that's the same answer that I've gotten for the past three months'.
