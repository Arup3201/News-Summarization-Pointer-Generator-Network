Local police have identified a body found in an abandoned well on Saturday as that of Bonnie Cooner of Canon, Georgia, who was reported missing on January 28.

Her boyfriend, Brent James Shubert, was arrested early Sunday in Anderson, South Carolina.

Cooner, a 33-year-old mother, was reported missing by a family member, who said she left behind a son, her car and other personal belongings, police said.

She was last seen at the home she shared with Shubert and her 12-year-old son Gavin in Canon.

Following nearly two weeks of investigation, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported Friday that a break in the case was close, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.

Local sheriff’s office investigators and GBI agents on Saturday drove to a secluded area in Franklin County where the well is located.

Their excavation of the well site continued the following day.

The corpse will be transferred to the GBI Crime Lab where an autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death and to confirm the identity of the remains.

GBI spokesman John Bankhead told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the results of the autopsy probably won’t be completed until Monday.

On Wednesday, the GBI joined the Franklin County Sheriff's Office in the hunt for Cooner as it emerged that a woman claiming to be Shubert's niece had alleged her uncle was behind the disappearance just days after she went missing.

Michelle Pilgrim commented on a Facebook page called 'rants or raves of elberton ga'
on February 1, 2013, saying that police had searched her grandmother's 
property for traces of the missing woman and that her uncle allegedly 
knew Cooner's whereabouts.

'Brent knows whats up. push him until
he gives,' Michelle Pilgrim wrote to Cooner's family members on the 
social networking site.

She
then said: 'If u want some 411 on brent, inbox me... plz inbox me. 
there is some things u and UR FAMILY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HIM IF U DONT 
ALREADY KNOW (sic).'

The woman alleges that Brent drove off on Sunday night with Cooner, leaving her son, Gavin, and his friend at the house.

'He came back after leavin an arguin with her alone,' she wrote on Facebook.

Pilgrim wrote on Facebook that Shubert has been in her family since he was 12.

'When his mom died, my grandma took him and my papa jim in,' she wrote.

'i know his manipulative ways... i go back with brent like no other (sic),' she said in another comment.

Pilgrim also claimed she wouldn't help police in the case because they 'never helped lock brent up in the past when he showed up @ my door with gavin in the truck and a gun his pocket ready to shoot my ma..'

Investigators have been questioning friends, family, associates and anyone who potentially has information about Cronner's whereabouts .

They have also been going through her phone records.

Police arrested Shubert at 2.30am on Sunday after police found him 
sleeping in his van parked at a Red Lobster in Anderson, South Carolina.

He is being charged with malice murder, aggravated assault and concealing a death. He may face additional charges at a later date, the GBI said.

Shubert is currently in custody in the state awaiting extradition to Georgia.
