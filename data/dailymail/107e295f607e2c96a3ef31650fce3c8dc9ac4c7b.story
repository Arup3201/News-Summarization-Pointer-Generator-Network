'White Privilege': Lone Star College-Tomball campus students are upset because a professor gave them a 'White Privilege' worksheet assignment (photographed) asking them to put a check mark next to any statement they believe applied to them and their 'white privilege'

Alienated: One student filed a claim and refused to complete the assignment saying the professor's aim was to make him 'feel bad'

Students were asked to read the 22-statement checklist and put a check mark by any statement they believe applied to them and their 'white privilege.' 

Though the assignment was given online, the student said he didn't even feel comfortable completing the assignment alone, behind a computer because it made him feel uncomfortable and singled out. 

'There was a white privileges handout, and a white privileges checklist, and a white privileges quiz to see how privileged you are as a white person,' the student told KPRC.

The student said the assignment was aimed to make him 'feel alienated' and 'bad.' 

Another Lone Star-College student, Brady Adams, told KPRC that, if had been given the assignment, he would have refused to complete it as well.

'If it's an assignment,' Adams said, 'I'd be like, I'd take a zero because that's kind of racist.'  

College: The college (photographed) released a statement saying the assignment was a 'supplemental' exercise with no point value

The worksheet included statements like: 'I can go shopping alone most of the time, pretty well assured that I will not be followed or harassed,' 'If a traffic cop pulls me over or if the IRS audits my tax return, I can be sure I haven't been singled out because of my race,' and 'I can turn on the television or open the front page of the paper and see people of my race being well represented.' 

The student did not want to be identified for fear of backlash from the professor and told KPRC that he hopes the professor will re-think the assignment.

Zero: Student Brady Adams (photographed) said if he had been given the assignment he would have taken 'a zero' because the assignment is 'racist'

The professor has not commented publicly about the assignment but the college released a statement saying the assignment was a 'supplemental' exercise with no point value.

The college stated: 'Diversity is an important topic covered in the Lone Star College Student Success Course. In addition to its importance, it can also be a very difficult topic to teach, facilitate, and even discuss with students...

'The purpose of this lesson is to encourage students to not only explore the rich dimensions of diversity that are contained within each person, but to also take time to reflect on the aspects of diversity that make up who they are as individuals.'
