A top girls' private school headteacher has said pressure from parents is leaving pupils unable to deal with failure.

St Paul's Girls' School head Clarissa Farr said many parents refused to accept their children coming in second place - and were frightened of how this would reflect on themselves.

She described the fathers and mothers of some children 'snowplough parents' who were overprotective and would clear the way in front of their children so nothing would go wrong.

The 'High Mistress' of St Paul's Girls' School said many parents refused to accept their children coming in second place - and claimed they were 'frightened' of anything that might result in failure 

They also treated school like a 'bespoke, commercial service' and had a Darwinian approach to life and anything less than 11A*s was an 'utter disaster'.

Speaking at the Girls' Schools Association conference this week, she said that parents were guilty of 'affluent neglect' by not showing enough attention to their children in the evenings.

'Their children will succeed above all and they're not at all on board with the idea of school as a community, learning to come second or that learning to give ground is an important part of education.'

She added: 'Parents have very high aspirations — they have a kind of ticking, frenetic anxiety — even the ones who are delightful to deal with are on edge because they haven't really got enough time to have the conversation they're trying to have with you.

'Anything that might result in success not happening for their son or daughter, in however small an arena, they're very frightened of.'

The independent school in West London is one of the most academic schools in the country and charges up to £22,500 a year - their headmistress said pushy parents meant their children would not cope with failure

Mrs Farr's West London independent school charges parents up to £22,500 a year. 

Its decorated alumni include broadcaster Susanna Reid, Alexandra Shulman, the editor-in-chief of Vogue and Harriet Harman, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.

The head, known as the 'High Mistress' at the school, said parents made things as easy as possible for their children which left them over-protected and unable to cope with failure, The Times reported last night.

She added: 'Again at the more extreme ends I've certainly noticed an increase in the expectation among parents that what is arranged for their daughter will be specific and bespoke.

'If she happens to speak a language that you don't offer, it will be expected that you provide appropriate tuition.

'Something that shocked me quite a lot, and I've seen it more in the last few years, is the naked impatience with the idea of putting other people first that you see coming from parents.

'I think that's a growing trend among city parents who have a sort of Darwinian attitude to their children's education.'

Teachers at city schools also had to be trained how to deal with high-achieving people used to getting what they wanted, The Times reported.

Mrs Farr added: 'They are over-protected. Snowplough parents is a great description: clearing everything away in front of the child so that nothing can go wrong, self-esteem valued above all other attributes, anything that might threaten self-esteem must be moved to the side.

'Protection from failure: not being selected for a play or the first lacrosse team etc or having the utter disaster of getting only 10 A*s instead of 11.

'A lack of perseverance — when they do come up against some failure or difficulty they don't have the equipment to deal with it because parents have prevented this.'

But the head praised some of her pupils for their awareness of current affairs and said many were doing community work.

She said: 'There's a lot to be proud of. They've seen these cataclysmic, economic environmental and political events playing out in their world, in a context where accessibility of information means it's right up in your face. That's changed the way they look at life.'
