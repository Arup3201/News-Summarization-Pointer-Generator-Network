Stargazers across north America were treated to an amazing display with the final partial solar eclipse of 2014. 

Across the continent amateur astronomers, school children and photographers were able to track the sun, which looked like it had lost a bite-sized chunk. 

According to NASA, the partial eclipse was the final such event of the year. For Americans, the next total solar eclipse will take place on August 21, 2017. 

The moon covers almost a third of the sun as it passes by the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at Notre Dame University in Indiana

In Missouri, the residents of West Alton waited patiently as heavy cloud obscured the partial eclipse, giving only a two-minute glimpse

Over in San Diego California, the cloudless sky provided a perfect view of the eclipse - which was shot through a special filter

A NASA spokesman said: 'Throughout history, total eclipses, in which the entire sun is blocked from view, have offered scientists the chance to see the faint light of the sun's atmosphere called the corona, without its being overwhelmed by the sun itself. 

'Total eclipses provide views of that atmosphere, which we otherwise can only get with specialized telescopes – both in space and on the ground -- that block out the bright light of the sun. As a partial eclipse, the October 23 eclipse is of less scientific interest, but it still makes for a great view!'

In New York, the event was overshadowed by heavy cloud but in the Canadian arctic, more than three-quarters of the sun had been obscured. 

There are three types of solar eclipse, ranging from the total eclipse, where the sun is completely blocked out by the moon. A partial eclipse is where only a section of the sun is obscured. 

The final type of eclipse is the annular eclipse. This is where the moon appears smaller than the sun and blocks everything apart from an external fiery ring. 

In this combination photograph taken from Mount Wilson Observatory, the sun looks almost like a bloated Pac Man character 

In Provo, Utah, it appears like the moon has taken a slightly larger chunk out of the sun as it approaches its zenith 

In Mexico, this images was taken in Esenada in the State of Baja California, showing several sun spots 

Up in the pacific northwest more than two-thirds of the sun is obscured from this vantage point in Kerry Park, Seattle

In Lake Hefner, Oklahoma City, a bird flies low past the sun which is silhouetted against some high-tension power lines 

When looking at a solar eclipse it is necessary to wear appropriate equipment as staring at the sun can cause blindness 

In Florida, this couple watch the sun setting off Sand Key on the Gulf of Mexico for the last partial eclipse of the year

This image was taken from Paynes Prairie in Gainsville Florida from behind a tree 

These fishermen in Panama City Beach, Florida don't seem too worried about the last eclipse in North America until August 2017 

People in Bowling Green, Ohio, only got the shortest of glimpses at the eclipse due to heavy cloud cover in the area

Americans queued up in their thousands to see the final partial solar eclipse of 2014 which crossed the nation

Unfortunately for eclipse fans, they will have to travel to Europe if they want any solar action next year

But in a special treat, NASA predicts that on August 21, 2017 a total solar eclipse will hit North America
