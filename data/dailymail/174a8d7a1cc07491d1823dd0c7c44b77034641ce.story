Thanks to Miley Cyrus's provocative dance routine at the VMAs last month, popstars, satirists and exhibitionists have jumped on the twerking bandwagon.

YouTube is awash with people parodying Miley's moves and the MailOnline previously reported how it has sparked a fitness craze with people keen to tone up with a 'twerk out'.

But while the former Disney star may be credited with the recent revival of the bent over, derriere-jiggling move, a yoga instructor has revealed that it can be traced back centuries before the 20-year-old started shaking her booty.   

Causing controversy: Miley Cyrus twerks with Robin Thicke at the VMAs

Barbara Purcell, 33, told the Daily Express: 'Although twerking can be traced back as 
far as 20 years in pop and hip hop culture, its roots may very well rest 
in the ancient traditions of yoga from thousands of years ago.

'The word most likely comes from the 
words work and twist. The combination creates a sexually charged dance 
move with thrusting hips and low squatting stance.'

Centuries-old: Miley sparked a new trend for twerking but a yoga instructor said the move belonged to them first

Barbara, who runs yoga classes in New York, said it's been a 'no brainer' to include the move in her sessions recently. Not only because it's what the Miley-inspired customers want, but because she said it works so well as a yoga move by engaging the chakra.

She explains: 'Yoga teaches an energy system within the
 body involving various energy points known as chakras. They basically 
move from our root, up the spine, to the crown.

'Lower chakra work with a bit of a twerk which is a sexually-charged move really helps this area - and it's proven very popular so far.'

Barbara isn't the only fitness instructor to start incorporate twerking into her classes.

Les Mills, creator of fitness programmes including Bodypump, told MailOnline earlier this month how it received a number of requests for a class featuring twerking moves following the VMAs.

They adapted their existing Bodyjam class to incorporate a number of energetic twerking moves and are even considering changing the class's name to the Twerkout.

Place your hands on your hips, with your feet turned out and your knees over your toes

To go forward, press your thumbs into your butt bone and move forward

To go back, the fingers pull back on the hip bone

Squat so that the only part of your body you can move is the hip section

For a more pronounced twerk, rest the hands on the knees, with the wrists facing out

Then up the tempo and shake the butt

And it's not just in the pop and fitness world that twerking is taking off.

The Oxford Dictionaries Online recently added the word with the definition: 'The twerk, v.: dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance.'

Katherine Connor Martin, from Oxford Dictionaries Online, said 'twerk' was around 20 years old and was coined as part of the 'bounce' hip-hop scene in the U.S.

'By last year, it had generated enough currency to be added to our new words watch list, and by this spring, we had enough evidence of usage frequency in a breadth of sources to consider adding it to our dictionaries of current English,' she said recently. 'There are many theories about the origin of this word, and since it arose in oral use, we may never know the answer for sure.

She added: 'The current public reaction to twerking is reminiscent in some ways of how the twisting craze was regarded in the early 1960s, when it was first popularised by Chubby Checkerâ€™s song, the Twist. Only time will tell if twerking will similarly be embraced by the general public.'
