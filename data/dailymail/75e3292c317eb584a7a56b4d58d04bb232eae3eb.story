Chinese police were shocked to discover a seemingly super-strong prostitute who ran away before sprinting up a tree to escape was actually a man dressed in women's clothing.

The incident happened during a purge of prostitutes in the red light district in the city of Nanning in south China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

The officers decided to stage the crackdown after local media highlighted that the number of street workers was spiralling out of control and that many of the girls were openly plying their trade on the streets.

However, after rounding up a group of girls, one of them suddenly shoved police out of the way and sprinted off before three officers chased her.

Police spokesman Kuan-Yin Tsai said: 'She did not run like a woman, she was very fast and managed to jump over a fence much more efficiently than the officers – but when she realised there were police in front of her as well she climbed up a tree like a cat, and refused to come down.'

Tsai said: 'The officers demanded to see her ID, which she said she had lost in running away, but they noticed that she seemed to have very powerful arms and the protruding Adam's apple, and eventually she admitted that actually she was a 31-year-old man and revealed that her name was Luo Shih.' 

He said that after checking 33 of the girls arrested that night they discovered that actually three of them were men dressed up as women who were offering oral sex to clients which has shocked many in China.
