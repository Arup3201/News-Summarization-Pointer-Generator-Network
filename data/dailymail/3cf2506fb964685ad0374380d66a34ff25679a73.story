About 400 people were arrested in Oakland yesterday during a chaotic day of Occupy protests that saw demonstrators break into City Hall and burn an American flag.

Police fired tear gas and used 'flash' grenades to disperse hundreds of people after some in the crowd threw rocks and bottles and tore down fencing outside a convention center.

It was the most turbulent day of protests since November, when Oakland police forcefully dismantled an Occupy encampment. An exasperated Mayor Jean Quan, who faced heavy criticism for the police action last fall, called on the Occupy movement to 'stop using Oakland as its playground.'

'People in the community and people in the Occupy movement have to stop making excuses for this behavior,' she said.

Authorities say protesters clashed 
with police throughout the day, at times throwing rocks, bottles and 
other objects at officers. The protests grew as the day wore on with an 
estimated 2,000 demonstrators in the streets at one point.

Most of the arrests came around 8pm, 
when police took about scores of protesters into custody as they marched
through the city's downtown, with some entering a YMCA building, 
according to officials.

Many other demonstrators were 
arrested earlier in the afternoon, after police said they threw rocks, 
bottles and other objects at officers and tore down fencing.

At about the same time police were 
taking people into custody near the YMCA, about 100 police officers 
surrounded City Hall, while others swept the inside of the building 
looking for protesters who had broken into the building, then ran out of
the building with American flags before officers arrived.

Ms Quan said that at one point, many 
forced their way into City Hall, where they burned flags, broke into an 
electrical box and damaged several art structures, including a recycled 
art exhibit created by children.

More help from other police agencies 
was also sent to Oakland, with busloads of Alameda County sheriff's 
deputies arriving in the downtown area late Saturday.

City Administrator Deanna Santana 
said protesters pelted officers with bottles, metal pipes, rocks and 
burning flares and police responded by deploying smoke, tear gas and 
bean bag rounds.

'These demonstrators stated their 
intention was to provoke officers and engage in illegal activity and 
that's exactly what has occurred today,' Ms Santana said.

The group assembled at a downtown 
plaza yesterday morning, with demonstrators threatening to take over the
vacant Henry Kaiser Convention Center. The group then marched through 
the streets, disrupting traffic.

The crowd grew as the day wore on, with afternoon estimates ranging from about 1,000 to 2,000 people.

The protesters walked to the convention center, where some started tearing down perimeter fencing and
'destroying construction equipment' shortly before 3pm, police said.

Police said they issued a dispersal 
order and used smoke and tear gas after some protesters pelted them with
bottles, rocks, burning flares and other objects.

Most of the arrests were made when 
protesters ignored orders to leave and assaulted officers, police said. 
By 4pm, the bulk of the crowd had left the convention center and headed 
back downtown.

The demonstration comes after Occupy 
protesters said earlier this week that they planned to move into a 
vacant building and turn it into a social center and political hub. They
also threatened to try to shut down the port, occupy the airport and 
take over City Hall.

In a statement on Friday, Ms Santana said the city would not be 'bullied by threats of violence or illegal activity.'

Interim police chief Howard Jordan also warned that officers would arrest those carrying out illegal actions.

Oakland officials said that
since the Occupy Oakland encampment was first established in late 
October, police have arrested about 300 people.

The national Occupy Wall Street 
movement, which denounces corporate excess and economic inequality, 
began in New York City in the fall but has been largely dormant lately.

Oakland, New York and Los Angeles 
were among the cities with the largest and most vocal Occupy protests 
early on. The demonstrations ebbed after those cities used force to move
out hundreds of demonstrators who had set up tent cities.

In Oakland, the police department 
received heavy criticism for using force to break up earlier protests. 
Among the critics was the mayor, Ms Quan, who said she wasn't briefed on
the department's plans.

Earlier this month, a court-appointed
monitor submitted a report to a federal judge that included 'serious 
concerns' about the department's handling of the Occupy protests.

Tension was rising in Washington as well, where the National Park Service has said it will bar Occupy protesters in the nation's capital from camping in two parks near the White House where they have been living since October.That order, if carried out as promised on Monday, could be a blow to one of the highest-profile chapters of the movement.
