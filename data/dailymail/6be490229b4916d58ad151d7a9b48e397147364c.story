Justice Secretary Chris Grayling says the taxpayer should not longer fund the system

One firm of solicitors was paid almost £15million in taxpayer-funded legal aid in a year, while 20 individual barristers each raked in more than £300,000, startling official figures reveal.

In a graphic illustration of the legal aid gravy train, the Ministry of Justice released a breakdown of payments to lawyers.

Among them was that to London-based firm Duncan Lewis, which deals with immigration and asylum cases and topped the payout list for 2011/12.

Only established in 1998, Duncan Lewis, which has become one of the country’s fastest growing firms of solicitors, billed taxpayers for a total of £14.63million in civil legal aid. Tuckers, based in London, Birmingham and Manchester, earned the most from publicly-funded criminal cases, taking £8.27million.

Immigration, human rights and corporate fraud barrister Balbir Singh was the highest-earning legal aid criminal barrister, earning £493,022. His high profile cases include defending Fariman Khan – jailed for supplying heroin and cocaine worth over £1million in 2007.

Paul Storey, a London-based QC who works in a range of fields including family law and personal injury, topped the list of legal aid payments in civil cases, earning £428,192.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the figures demonstrated that it was ‘not sustainable’ for taxpayers to keep funding a legal aid system that has become one of the most expensive in the world.

Mr Grayling accused lawyers of going into ‘overdrive’ and making ‘over the top’ claims to try to attack Government plans to reduce the legal aid bill.

Barristers and solicitors have demonstrated against planned cuts to the service

Ministers are planning to cut 
£220million from the annual criminal legal aid budget in England and 
Wales and have already slashed £350million from the legal aid bill for 
civil cases.

They are consulting on plans to make lawyers compete for contracts and introduce a household disposable income cap, to remove the right of the best off to ask the taxpayer to foot the bill for their representation in court.

Criminal defendants living in households with a disposable income of £37,500 or more will be stopped from automatically accessing legal aid, while prisoners’ rights to support will also be curbed.

But yesterday leading barristers and human rights campaigners demonstrated on the road outside the Ministry of Justice, waving placards that read ‘justice is not for sale’ and ‘defend legal aid’.

Human rights campaigner and Mick Jagger’s ex-wife Bianca Jagger, who addressed yesterday’s protest, said: ‘The legal aid lawyers are really paid very little.

Legal workers claimed plans to overhaul legal aid would remove the right of defendants to choose a solicitor and hit those who needed lawyers with specialist expertise

‘We are not talking about people who 
earn a lot of money. Do we want to cut services and legal aid so that we
 will have a risk of miscarriages of justice? Let’s remember that 45 per
 cent of all people that are charged turn out to be innocent.’

A retired senior judge, Sir Anthony 
Hooper, claimed plans to overhaul legal aid would remove the right of 
defendants to choose a solicitor and hit those who needed lawyers with 
specialist expertise.

Mr Grayling accused lawyers of using an ‘evocative and creative defence’ to try to protect legal aid – pointing out that a single trial can cost more than £10million in fees.

‘At around £2billion a year, we have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world. At a time of major financial challenges, felt by businesses and households across the country, the legal sector cannot be excluded from our commitment to getting the best value for money for the taxpayer,’ he told the Daily Mail.

‘Our proposals absolutely protect the right to a fair trial. Good lawyers will still be available, just as they are now, as contracts will only be awarded to those who meet clear quality standards.’

The Justice Secretary said the Government currently spent more on legal aid than on preventing criminals reoffending or apprenticeships. ‘

Sir Anthony, who retired as a Court of Appeal judge last year, insisted the plans risked harming a system of fair justice.

‘If I’m arrested in Norwich on a complex fraud case, for example, I would be able under the present system to find maybe a solicitors in London or Manchester, or wherever it may be, who specialise in difficult fraud cases,’ he said.

‘Not now. Someone will turn up at the door and say “I’m representing you. And by the way, I’m employed by the following company”.’

A spokesman for Duncan Lewis said it provided legal advice and assistance to approximately 25,000 clients a year, adding: ‘Many of our fee earners have enhanced accreditation qualifications and panel memberships with the Law Society and have been acknowledged as experts in their fields within the legal community.

‘At a time where the Government has made and continues to make drastic cuts to the provision of legal aid, Duncan Lewis is one of the few established firms left providing legal advice and assistance under the legal aid scheme, making it possible for members of the public, many of them vulnerable, to have continued access to justice.’

Asil Nadir received £1million in legal aid

The legal profession – which stands to lose more than £200million a year in fees – has been fighting the most ferocious lobbying campaign against cuts to the £1billion criminal legal aid budget.

In order to make their case, lawyers and their supporters have focused on highly emotive issues. For instance, Sir Anthony Hooper told the BBC that – because defendants will no longer be able to pick whichever lawyer they want – disabled suspects might be left with somebody who does not understand their condition.

The Ministry of Justice dismisses this criticism, saying all lawyers under the new regime will have to meet rigorous standards. But, in any case, it is hugely misleading to suggest Mr Grayling’s reforms are designed to target the poor and the vulnerable.

Rather, they will reduce the income of some of the best paid lawyers in the land, stop prisoners making frivolous claims against the State and turn off the legal aid tap to the very wealthy.

Currently, the best paid QCs can rake in more than £500,000 in a single year, usually by working on complicated cases which the legal system manages to stretch out for months and even years.

In 2010/11, more than £1.5million from public funds went to  just three barristers. In so-called ‘very high cost cases’, which last more than 90 days, payments will now be reduced by 30  per cent.

With fees standing at £500-a-day for advocacy, plus up to £150 per hour for preparation work, lawyers will struggle to convince the public they are being hard done by.

In other measures, defendants living in households with a ‘disposable income’ of £37,500 or more are to be stopped from automatically accessing legal aid. In reality, this will not affect anybody earning less than £100,000-a-year.

But it will mean that the likes of the former fugitive Asil Nadir would no longer be able to take the taxpayer for a ride. Nadir – who rented a £23,000-a-month London residence during his trial – received £1,056,588.

Other criminals who have milked the system include convicted gangster Terry Adams, who got £4.7million.

Then there are criminals who have 
already been convicted. The Association of Prison Lawyers (the existence
 of which speaks volumes) said Mr Grayling’s reforms would effectively 
remove legal aid for all prison law issues other than parole and 
disciplinary hearing.

Again, once the detail is known, they may struggle to convince the public this is a bad thing.

Currently, taxpayers are handing nearly half a million pounds in legal aid every week to prisoners making human  rights claims.

Last
 October, one of the country’s most senior judges, Lord Justice Davis, 
warned that  human rights laws meant ‘unthinkable’ cases were coming 
before the courts.

He hit 
out as he dismissed a case brought by two prisoners – rapist Desmond 
Grant, who was given legal aid, and paedophile Roger Gleaves – who 
demanded an end to ‘slopping out’. They were unhappy at having no toilet
 in their cell.
