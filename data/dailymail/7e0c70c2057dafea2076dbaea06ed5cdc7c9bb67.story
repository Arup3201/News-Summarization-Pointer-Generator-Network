Extraordinary footage of a group of teenagers scaling one of the highest man-made structures in Russia without any safety equipment has appeared on the internet.

In a video posted on YouTube, a trio of 'skywalkers' can be seen taking photographs from the top of the 1,000ft high Russky Island Bridge, located near Vladivostok in the east of the country.

The three minute clip shows the group climbing ladders hand over hand and traversing walkways with nothing but water visible far below.

Long way down: The view looking down at the Eastern Bosphorus from the top of the Russky Island Bridge

At one point, the camera pans to show two beaming members of the group who give V-signs to celebrate reaching the top of the structure.

Then, amazingly, one of the teens can be seen fearlessly stepping over the parapet of one walkway and dangling his foot over the precipice.

He later follows this up by giving one of his friends a high-five.

Highway: The Russky Island bridge, which will carry traffic between the island and Vladivostok, is expected to open in September 2012

The daredevil stunt echoes a similar climb in September, when four youngsters filmed themselves scaling the Moskovskyi Bridge in Kiev, Ukraine, and uploaded the footage to YouTube.

The Russky Island Bridge will be the the world's largest cable-stayed bridge when it opens to the public in September.

The 1,885m long structure will carry four lanes of traffic - two in each direction - over the eastern Bosphorus strait which separates Vladivostok from Russky Island.
