Helen Glover and Heather Stanning claimed gold in the women's pair before the men's four added a second triumph as Great Britain celebrated four more medals at the World Rowing Championships in Amsterdam on Saturday.

Olympic champions Glover and Stanning led from the front on a day where Alex Gregory, Mohamed Sbihi, George Nash and Andrew Triggs Hodge followed suit, while both the men's pair and the men's quadruple clinched silver for Britain.

Glover and Stanning took an early lead in their race and pressed on to record a world-best time of six minutes 50.61 seconds to come home ahead of silver winners the United States, with New Zealand in third.

The win handed Glover her second consecutive world women's pair title, and she said: 'This feels different to last year. Because of the history that Heather and I have, this win was more expected. Last year, with Polly (Swann), it was all very new.

'When Heather turned round to look at me, I was saying 'thanks'. It is something I am really proud of.'

Men's four Gregory, Sbihi, Nash and Triggs Hodge were pushed at the start before powering across the line first to come home ahead of the USA and Australia in a time of 5mins 40.24secs.

Gregory was delighted with the performance and said: 'We were all pretty nervous before that one. We were unbeaten this season and we all knew we had to go out and perform.

'We raced the USA in the semi-final and they did exactly the same thing. For us, It was all about keeping cool and calm and then to pull could away when we needed to.

'Moe (Sbihi) made the call at just the right time and we all responded and the boat just flew.'

Triggs Hodge added: 'It was really tough out there but we knew what we had to do. We had to push on and really dominate and that's what we did.'

The men's pair of James Foad and Matthew Langridge impressed as they claimed silver after just six weeks in the boat together, crossing behind defending champions New Zealand.

Graeme Thomas, Sam Townsend, Charles Cousins and Peter Lambert missed out on gold by just 0.09 seconds in the men's quadruple as they finished behind European champions Ukraine.

GB Rowing team performance director Sir David Tanner said: 'I am very, very pleased with our medals today. We have had two outstanding golds and silvers and it's been very difficult conditions but we've mastered them to produce four fine medals for GB.'
