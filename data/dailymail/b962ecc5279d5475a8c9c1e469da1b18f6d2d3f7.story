Ashley Cole wants to finish his career in Europe out of respect for Chelsea’s fans after confirming that he has played his last game for them.

Although Cole could stay in the Barclays Premier League, he wants to move away from England after failing to agree a new deal at Stamford Bridge.

AC Milan, who finished eighth in Serie A last season, are among a number of clubs interested in the former England left back, including Monaco, who who could offer him a massive tax-free contract.

Saying goodbye: Ashley Cole will look for a move abroad after leaving Chelsea at the end of the season

Respect: The left back feels too close to the Chelsea fans to move to one of their rivals

Interest: AC Milan and Monaco are two possible destinations for Cole

Cole’s £130,000-a-week deal at Chelsea has come to an end and he is available on a free transfer.

A move to Real Madrid, where former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti is preparing for the Champions League final, was Cole’s preferred option but it appears his chances have receded after it emerged that Brazil left back Marcelo and Portugal defender Fabio Coentrao will stay next season.

At 33 Cole wants first-team football next season and he will decide his future when he returns from his summer holiday.

Tottenham, who are desperate for a left-sided defender, would take him and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said in December he would be prepared to see Cole return to the club, but the former England left back, who quit international football when he was overlooked for the World Cup squad in Brazil, does not want to join one of Chelsea’s rivals.

Match made in heaven: Ashley Cole joined Chelsea and Jose Mourinho from Arsenal in 2006

Strain: But Mourinho hasn't been able to stop Cole from smoking, which he actively despises

Now a blue: Cole celebrates with his Chelsea team-mates after a goal against former club Arsenal

Cole left Arsenal in 2006 to join 
Jose Mourinho’s side, but his relationship with Chelsea’s manager has 
become complicated. Mourinho actively despises smoking and has never 
been able to convince the defender to quit the habit.

Cole’s
 standing at the club was also affected by his decision to continue with
 his Christmas party the night after Chelsea’s Capital One Cup defeat at
 Sunderland.

Mourinho called Chelsea’s players and urged them to reconsider their plans for a central London dinner after that unexpected defeat at the Stadium of Light.

Although most players heeded the warning and turned back, Cole carried on regardless and was later spotted partying with Arsenal players.

After an appearance against Stoke on January 26, Cole then spent 18 games on the sidelines.

When Chelsea lost at Crystal Palace, he told those sitting near him in the directors’ box that he would be leaving in the summer.

He made a brief return to the Chelsea
 team at the end of the season when Mourinho picked him for the 
Champions League tie at Atletico Madrid.

He
 remained in the team for the victory at Liverpool and was also picked 
to play in the Champions League semi-final second leg defeat at Stamford
 Bridge against Atletico.

In Chelsea’s final home game of the season, against Norwich at Stamford Bridge, Cole left the field in tears.

It
 was then he realised he had played his last home game for the club, 
although he did play in the victory at Cardiff on the last day of the 
season.

Respect: The Chelsea players watch on as Cole claps his fans for the last time against Cardiff City

Tearful at Stamford Bridge: Cole has barely featured this season due to Cesar Azpilicueta's form
