Chelsea's plans to sign a replacement for Fernando Torres have hit a snag with Roma ruling out the sale of Mattia Destro.

Jose Mourinho had hoped to snap up the 23-year-old Italian with £50million flop Torres on the way on AC Milan.

But Roma - who signed Blues stalwart Ashley Cole this summer - insist Destro will not be leaving the club.

'We've not reached out to anybody. He's not for sale, it's completely off the table. I decided that a year ago he wasn't for sale.' the club's president, James Pallotta said.

'We've got a great front line with Destro there. You won't see any crazy things going on, that's for sure.'

Destro hit 13 goals in last season's Serie A campaign which saw Roma finish second behind Juventus.

Torres' representatives are in talks with the west London club over severance pay to end his torrid spell at Stamford Bridge.

The Spanish striker hopes to join Milan on a permanent deal, filling the hole left by shock Liverpool signing Mario Balotelli
