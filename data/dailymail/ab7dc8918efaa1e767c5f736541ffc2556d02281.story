Google may soon let children under the age of 13 have accounts - providing their parents have control over them, rumours suggest.

The move would give youngsters limited access to sites such as YouTube and Gmail, with some content remaining age restricted.

But the rumours have sparked some privacy concerns for children among experts. 

California-based Google is apparently planning to let youngsters sign up for accounts for its various services. This would include giving kids their own YouTube and Gmail accounts while imposing age restrictions (YouTube image shown). The move would enable parents to monitor the online activity of their kids

Internet companies such as Google and Facebook do not offer their services to children under 13, but it is tough to catch users who sign up by providing false information.

More than 1 billion unique users visit YouTube each month.

Over 4 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube.

72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute.

70 per cent of YouTube traffic comes from outside the US.

YouTube is localized in 53 countries and across 61 languages.

In 2011, YouTube had more than 1 trillion views or around 140 views for every person on Earth.

Millions of free subscriptions happen each day.

Subscriptions allow you to connect with channels you're interested in and keep up with their activity on the site. 

A US law called Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or Coppa, imposes strict controls on the collection and use of information about children under 13.

Google's effort is partly driven by the fact that some parents are already trying to create accounts for their children and the company wants to make the process easier and compliant with the rules, the Wall Street Journal reported.

A story in The Information said the new initiative would allow youngsters to obtain YouTube accounts on a child-friendly version of the site.

When signing up for an account users will also be required to disclose their age, with parents then given an a dashboard application to monitor the online activity of their children.

However, some have questioned how Google will tackle privacy concerns of children.

‘Unless Google does this right it will threaten the privacy of millions of children and deny parents the ability to make meaningful decisions about who can collect information on their kids,’ Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, told the Wall Street Journal.

'Google doesn’t comment on rumour or speculation,' a spokesperson for the company told MailOnline when asked to confirm or deny the rumours.

Earlier this week David Cameron announced that in the UK online music videos would get age ratings to help protect children from highly sexual and violent content.

The Prime Minister unveiled a pilot scheme involving YouTube and Vevo as he gave details of his own struggle to prevent his son and two daughters watching inappropriate material.

Concerns have been growing for years about the kind of footage freely available to young children online. Examples of videos that have caused alarm include Miley Cyrus's Wrecking Ball, which shows her suggestively licking a sledgehammer, and sexual images in Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines.

Under the arrangements being tested from October, record labels will submit videos thought likely to attract a 12 rating or above to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).

Sites such as YouTube will then display the ratings, and they could potentially be used by filtering software to enable parents to block unsuitable clips.

'To take just one example - bringing up children in an internet age, you are endlessly worried about what they are going to find online,' he said.

'So we've taken a big stand on protecting our children online. We're making family friendly filters the default setting for all new online customers and we're forcing existing customers to make an active choice about whether to install them.'

He added: 'From October, we're going to help parents protect their children from some of the graphic content in online music videos by working with the British Board of Film Classification, Vevo and YouTube to pilot the age rating of these videos.'
