A Nasa mission designed to study the interaction of Earth's magnetic field and the sun launched this morning at 2:44am GMT (last night at 10:44pm EDT).

The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission will use four identical spacecraft to measure a mysterious process known as magnetic reconnection.

By orbiting Earth, the spacecraft will seek to understand how energy from the sun is funnelled in to the environment of not only our own but other planets, causing space weather such as aurorae.

The United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with Nasa's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft onboard is seen here launching from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 in Florida this morning at 2:44am GMT (last night at 10:44pm EDT)

The groundbreaking and complex mission represents the first time this astronomical phenomena will be studied in extremely fine detail.

The spacecraft were launched on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 421 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

After reaching orbit, each spacecraft deployed from the upper stage of the rocket in five-minute increments.

'I am speaking for the entire MMS team when I say we're thrilled to see all four of our spacecraft have deployed and data indicates we have a healthy fleet,' said Craig Tooley, project manager at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

Magnetic reconnection occurs wherever charged gases, called plasma, are present.

It's rare on Earth, but plasma makes up 99 per cent of the visible universe, fueling stars and filling the near-vacuum of space.

This plasma contains magnetic fields that affects the way charged particles it encounters move.

Under normal conditions, the magnetic field lines inside plasmas don't break or merge with other field lines.

But sometimes, as field lines get close to each other, the entire pattern changes and everything realign into a new configuration.

The amount of energy released can be formidable. Magnetic reconnection taps into the stored energy of the magnetic field, converting it into heat and kinetic energy that sends particles streaming out along the field lines.

The MMS mission will help scientsits understand how this process is taking place in the environment around Earth.

This could teach us more about geomagnetic storms and aurorae on our planet, and also help us understand similar processes taking place in the rest of the solar system and beyond.

Over the following weeks, Nasa scientists and engineers will deploy several complex booms and antennae on the spacecraft, and test all their instruments.

The core of each spacecraft is about four feet (1.2 metres) tall and 11 feet (3.4 metres) wide, although with all of their booms and antennae deployed, they grow to 369 by 94ft (29 by 112 metres).

The four will then be placed in a pyramid formation, separated by distances of 6.2 to 62 miles (10 to 100km), in preparation for science observations that are scheduled to begin in early September.

They will fly around Earth in an elliptical orbit, travelling through two regions where magnetic reconnection is thought to be occurring.

One of these is the side of Earth nearest the sun, where plasma from the sun interacts with Earth's magnetosphere.

This interaction transfers energy from the sun to Earth's environment, creating 'magnetic explosions' when the magnetic field lines connect.

The process of magnetic reconnection can release bursts of energy that are as powerful as billions of megatons of TNT, which send particles surging through space at the speed of light.

On Earth, we can see the effects of this in the aurora at the poles, but it can also be dangerous to satellites and cause problems for communications.

At the other side of Earth, away from the sun, the spacecraft will pass through a region where Earth's magnetic field lines combine, and produce a similar effect.

Magnetic reconnection can harm satellites (illustrated) and affect communications, so scientists are keen to understand more about the phenomenon

The spacecraft will sturdy the former phenomenon for one and a half years, while the following science phase will focus on the latter phenomenon.

'After a decade of planning and engineering, the science team is ready to go to work,' said Jim Burch, principal investigator for the MMS instrument suite science team at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio (SwRI).

'We've never had this type of opportunity to study this fundamental process in such detail.'

The mission will provide the first three-dimensional views of reconnection occurring in Earth's magnetic space environment.

But aside from providing more information about our own planet, scientists will use the data to work out how the sun affects other planets, and also how the process takes place in other stars.

The data could also provide information on how magnetic reconnection occurs near black holes and neutron stars, and also at the edge of the solar system at the boundary of our sun's influence and interstellar space.

'MMS is a crucial next step in advancing the science of magnetic reconnection – and no mission has ever observed this fundamental process with such detail,' said Jeff Newmark, interim director for Nasa's Heliophysics Division at the agency's Headquarters in Washington.

'The depth and detail of our knowledge is going to grow by leaps and bounds, in ways that no one can yet predict.'
