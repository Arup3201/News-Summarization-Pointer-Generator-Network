An extreme sports enthusiast cleared an island in the Pacific Ocean in one bound, using strong winds to jump 50ft in the air.

Two-time kitesurfing world champion Youri Zoon, 24, leaped over a small islet while kiteboarding off the coast of New Caledonia - covering a distance of more than 120ft.

The Dutch daredevil travelled at a speed of 22mph when approaching the island to complete his impressive bound.

Leap of faith: World champion kite surfer Youri Zoon leaping over the Pacific Ocean island in one go

Mr Zoon, said: 'Making the jump felt amazing - I got a rush of adrenaline as I took off.

'Once I got over half of the island I knew I was going to make it and that is when it felt really great.'

The impressive stunt took place at the island of Mbuke, New Caledonia. Mr Zoon estimated that the island is more than 120ft wide.

Halfway... The world champion kitesurfer is nearly home and dry as he jumps over his friends

A group of his fellow kitesurfers sat on the island while he jumped over them.

Kitesurfing is an extreme sport which uses wakeboards and controllable kites to harnesses the power of the wind.

The stunt was not without hiccups - on his third attempt Mr Zoon, of Ouddorp, crashed into a tree.

Mr Zoon said: 'I headed out onto the sea when I saw the wind was picking up. Someone made the suggestion that I should try and jump over the whole island.

'I was constantly worried I would hit the beach or the shallow water on the other side - that would not have made for a soft landing.

'On my third attempt I was up pretty high up when I started to fall, but I was able to control the crash and landed fairly safely, despite hitting a tree.'

Mr Zoon has won the kitesurfing world title twice, once in 2011 and again the following year.
