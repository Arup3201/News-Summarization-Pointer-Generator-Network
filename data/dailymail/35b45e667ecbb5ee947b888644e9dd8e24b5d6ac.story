Fraser Forster has been ruled out for the rest of the season and may miss the start of the next after scans revealed he has broken his kneecap.

Forster came off injured during Southampton's win against Burnley on Saturday and was pulled out of the England squad, with estimates now suggesting he could be out for between nine months and a year.

The Saints have made a statement to confirm that Forster has undergone surgery on the injury to his left patella tendon, and said they will wait to assess how long he will be missing for until the affects are known.

'Southampton Football Club can confirm that Fraser Forster has successfully undergone surgery on the knee injury he suffered during Saturday’s win over Burnley,' read the statement.

'A longer-term prediction of when Forster will return to action will be made following further assessment once the effects of his operation have settled down. The club’s medical staff are confident he will make a full recovery.'

It is bad timing for England boss Roy Hodgson after learning Ben Foster will be out for six months with a cruciate knee ligament injury.

Rob Green was called up for the games against Lithuania and Italy.

Forster's injury came following a collision with Burnley striker Sam Vokes at St Mary's, with the goalkeeper taken off on a stretcher during the Saints' 2-0 win over Burnley.

England goalkeeper Joe Hart admitted that the injuries to Foster and Forster have hit the England camp hard but backs Rob Green to step up in their absence.

Hart said: 'I was gutted for Ben and Fraser. It’s really, really sad news. It has rocked us all as a goalkeeping group and rocked all the lads in the squad because they are great guys and they are having a great season.

'But Greeny has come in and hopefully he can profit. He did brilliant in the Championship last year. I remember watching him in the play-off final, when he was man of the match for me. QPR are in a bad position but he has been fantastic this season.

'Greeny is rock solid. His mentality is great. And he is a very good goalkeeper who has been playing at the top level for a long time. There are no surprises.'
