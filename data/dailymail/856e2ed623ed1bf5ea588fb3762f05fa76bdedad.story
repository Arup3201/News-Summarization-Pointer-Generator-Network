Warning: Mr Fox said Britain was powerless to prevent some 'very unsavoury individuals' entering the country

Liam Fox last night sparked a row with Russia after claiming that the Kremlin was planning to use next year’s London Olympics as cover  to flood Britain with spies.

The former Defence Secretary warned that Britain was powerless to prevent some ‘very unsavoury individuals’ entering the country under the guise of protecting Russia’s athletics team. 

Dr Fox – privy to highly classified material from the intelligence services before he was forced to resign from the Cabinet in October – is one of the most senior political figures to speak publicly about the threat to Britain from Russia’s resurgent espionage activity.  Last night, the Kremlin accused Fox of ‘paranoia’.

And in further controversial remarks, Dr Fox criticised the cost of the Games, arguing that the Trident nuclear programme was better value for money.

Dr Fox told an audience of Hammersmith and Fulham Conservatives: ‘We face a very large number of FSB agents [Russia’s successor organisation to the KGB]  coming to London during the Olympics, including some very unsavoury individuals.

‘There’s no way we can do anything about that.

'When the Russians decide they have to send people to protect their team, they’ll choose a very large number of FSB people to do that.

MI5 claimed that Russian parliamentary researcher Katia Zatuliveter was a 'honeytrap' spy

'London’s going to be an interesting place next summer.’

His remarks, made on Tuesday night, 
follow last week’s rejection by an immigration panel of MI5’s claim that
 Russian parliamentary researcher Katia Zatuliveter was a ‘honeytrap’ 
spy placed in the office of Lib Dem defence expert Mike Hancock.

One former British diplomat in Moscow 
said: ‘There is an issue here of ensuring that the Olympics do not 
become an excuse for clandestine operations.’

But
 Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian  prime minister Vladimir Putin, 
said: ‘We are not concerned about his opinion. That is typical 
paranoia.’

Dr Fox, who 
resigned over his links with lobbyist friend Adam Werritty, also queried
 why he was criticised for spending £20billion on replacing Trident – 
which ‘gives 35 years’ protection’ to the country – while no one 
objected to ‘spending £13billion on the Olympics for three weeks’.
