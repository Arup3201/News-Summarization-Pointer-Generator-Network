A moment of great joy quickly turned to immense pain for Georgia State coach Ron Hunter when he tore his Achilles celebrating his team's 38-36 win over Georgia Southern on Sunday.

Hunter rushed onto the court to embrace his son R.J., who had made two free throws with 21.6 seconds left, at the final buzzer in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament championship in New Orleans.

Unfortunately for Hunter Sr. he managed to tear his Achilles as he jumped up and down hugging his son and eventually he had to be helped off the court.

'I'm actually embarrassed by this because it takes away honestly from what these kids have done,' said Hunter

'To be honest with you, I saw the kid shoot the ball. I saw the red lights go off…and I jumped up. I tore my Achilles' years ago on the right side playin' basketball when I was 26 years old,' Hunter told reporters afterwards, 'and it was the exact same feeling. I knew when I jumped up.

'I hadn't jumped that high probably in 26 years. I knew when I came down I had done it and instead of stopping right there, I wanted to go celebrate with my team and, more importantly, I wanted to go celebrate with my son.'

Hunter Snr. later returned to the court on crutches and helped cut down the nets, which were lowered for him, reports the Washington Post.

'I'm actually embarrassed by this,' Hunter said, 'because it takes away honestly from what these kids have done.'

The win clinched Georgia State's third appearance in the NCAA Tournament and first since 2001.
