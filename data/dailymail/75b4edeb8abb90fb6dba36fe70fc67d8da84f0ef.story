A British army soldier who died after collapsing while on a training exercise has been named today as Private Michael Ihemere.

The 1st Battalion Mercian Regiment soldier, who was aged 26 and originally from Nigeria, was taken ill during a three-mile run across rugged terrain on the Catterick Garrison training area near Leyburn North Yorkshire.

After it became clear that he was 
seriously ill, members of his unit, who returned from a tour of 
Afghanistan in April, alerted paramedics shortly before 9am on 
Wednesday.

Despite efforts to resuscitate the soldier, who was based at Marne Barracks, in Catterick Village, he was pronounced dead at the scene overlooking the Yorkshire Dales National Park.

Although a police investigation is underway there are no suspicious circumstances and the death is believed to have been a tragic accident.

Writing on the regiment’s Twitter account, senior officers said they were saddened to announce the soldier’s death.

Earlier today Pte Ihemere’s widow, Blessing, and colleagues from his regiment attended a memoral Parade at Marne Barracks in Catterick Village.

He had joined the British Army in November 2011 and, after successfully completing infantry training, was posted to The 1st Battalion, The Mercian Regiment in September.

He deployed to Afghanistan in October 2012 serving with C Company, based in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand province.

His commanding officer, Lt Col Mark Ellwood MBE, said: ‘Pte Ihemere quickly established himself as a valued member of his platoon.

‘He proved to be a reliable, talented and popular soldier, respected by all across the company.

‘His likeable and kind nature immediately endeared him to those he worked with.

‘Whilst on operations, he was involved in some fierce fighting but always remained calm, did his job well and supported his friends and colleagues with resolute loyalty.

‘Pte Ihemere showed early signs that he had the potential to progress in the Army and had a bright future.

‘His loss will be keenly felt across the battalion and the thoughts, prayers and sympathies of all those that had the pleasure to know Private Ihemere are with his wife and family at this difficult time.’

The death comes weeks after the deaths of three soldiers during an SAS training exercise in the Brecon Beacons.

Questions were raised about military training methods after it emerged reservists James Dunsby, Edward John Maher and Craig John Roberts had collapsed after carrying weighted packs on South Wales’s highest mountain, Pen Y Fan, on one of the hottest days of the year.

However, the Met Office said the temperature in the Leyburn area at the time of the latest death was 17C and there had been a light breeze.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said that as the incident was being investigated, it could not comment on whether the soldiers had been carrying weighted packs.

He said: 'Our thoughts remain with the soldier’s family at this time.'

It is understood the Army’s Land Accidents Investigation Team has launched an inquiry into the incident and North Yorkshire Police said it was investigating why the soldier had died.

A police spokesman said: 'Officers were called just before 9am on Wednesday 28 August 2013 
following a report that a 26-year-old man, serving in the military, had 
collapsed at Barden Moor, Leyburn.

'Sadly, despite the efforts of paramedics, he was pronounced dead at the scene.

'We are not yet in a position to release his name. His family have been informed.

'Officers
are working with the Army to establish the full circumstances 
surrounding the death, which is not suspicious, so that a file can be 
prepared on behalf of the coroner.'

Staff working at the barracks said many soldiers living at the barracks, who had been preparing for a family sports afternoon and barbecue event, had been shocked after learning of the soldier’s death. The light infantry regiment draws most of its soldiers from the Cheshire and Wirral area.
