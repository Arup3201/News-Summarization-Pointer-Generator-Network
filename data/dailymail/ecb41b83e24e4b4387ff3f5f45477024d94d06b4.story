British consumers did 10 per cent less of their shopping with cash last year, it emerged today.

The revelation has prompted experts to suggest 'money is about to change forever' - and brings closer the concept of a future without notes or coins, where shoppers pay for everything with plastic.

More than half of transactions were still paid in cash, but notes and coins made up just £29 in every £100 spent at retailers last year, which is down from £32 in 2011, the British Retail Consortium said.

Many shoppers have switched from cash to
using debit cards and growing online payment services such as PayPal - 
while avoiding credit cards as they try to better manage their tighter 
budgets.

‘New ways to pay and new ways to shop are shaping the retail landscape like never before,’ BRC director general Helen Dickinson said.

‘Changing customer preferences are driving the increase in debit card use - they're helping people to manage their money better and are a natural fit for online shopping and self-service checkouts.’

More than 54 per cent of transactions were paid in cash in 2012, but use declined as a proportion both in the number of transactions - down 7 per cent - and money spent, dropping 10 per cent.

This is the first time in the BRCC survey's 13 year history that both measures have seen a decline. The average cash transaction size dropped to £9.78 in 2012 - from £10.45 in 2011.

‘It is no longer a sweeping statement to suggest that money is about to change forever,’ Mark Hale of KPMG consultants told City AM. ‘It might not be tomorrow, but the direction is set.’

The survey, which covered nearly 10billion retail payments, revealed credit and charge card use was down by 3 per cent as a proportion of transactions. Transactions on debit cards went the other way - up 3 per cent, it revealed.

Use of alternative payment methods more than doubled on 2011, the survey said, driven by manufacturers' money-off coupons and the rapid growth of PayPal and other online payments. They now account for 5 per cent of all transactions.

The BRC expects to see further growth in non-card payments such as those using mobile phones. It also said that 40 per cent of manned tills can now accept 'tap and go' contactless card payments.

A number of retailers said they are 
planning to roll this out over the coming year, which would mean that 
over half of tills will have the capability for contactless payments to 
be made.

Almost a third of Britons would choose a smartphone over a wallet when going out if they could only take one item, a survey said.

In addition some 83 per cent of respondents in the UK, U.S., Canada, Germany and Australia said they wished they did not have to carry a wallet, the PayPal study revealed today.

The research also showed that a quarter of British consumers are frequently unable to pay for goods due to a lack of cash in their wallet.

The survey added that banks continue to levy huge charges on retailers for handling card payments.

The average cost to a retailer of having
a credit or charge card payment processed was 25 times higher than for 
cash - 38p versus 1.5p.

‘Cash is still the most popular way to pay,’ Mrs Dickinson said. ‘But our survey shows how rapidly alternative and emerging methods are gaining ground, with growth more than doubling on the previous year, albeit from a low base.

‘These methods will be the “ones to watch” in the future, and retailers are investing heavily to make sure their customers have choice and convenience in ways to pay, whether in-store, at home or on the move.’
