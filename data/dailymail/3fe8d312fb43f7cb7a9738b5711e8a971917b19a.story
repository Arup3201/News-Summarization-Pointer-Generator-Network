The young father who went missing with his baby son and taunted police as they searched for him came forward today and was arrested for assault and criminal damage.

Kieran Carroll, 22, of Luton, Bedfordshire, was reported missing at around midday on Tuesday along with his eight-month-old son Louis.

After reappearing following a three-day police search he was arrested today for assaulting a woman and damaging her mobile phone - offences which allegedly committed on the day he went missing.

Came forward: Kieran Carroll, 22, from Luton, has reappeared with his eight-month-old son Louis (right, together) after going missing for three days. Police released CCTV footage of the father in their search (left)

Currently he is not facing any charges for disappearing with his son.

A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said: 'A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of common assault against a woman and criminal damage of a mobile phone. 

'Both incidents are believed to have happened in Luton on Tuesday 3 March.

'The man was arrested in Kempston earlier today. He was later released on bail with stringent conditions and is due to report back to Luton police station on 31 March.'

On Wednesday, police searching for the pair released CCTV footage from the day before showing him pushing a pram as he left a hotel in the town at about 2pm.

Taunt: This comment, posted in response to a police appeal, is believed to have come from one of three accounts belonging to Mr Carroll

In response: Detective Inspector Sean Quinn replied to the Facebook post with this message

Relief: Bedfordshire Police were concerned Mr Carroll did not have any supplies for baby Louis

When Mr Carroll's image was shared on Facebook by Bedfordshire Police, a profile understood to belong to the father posted: 'I'm fine, so is my child - go look for some killers'.

The force also published a photo of Louis on Facebook, along with new details on the search. The taunting response came from one of three accounts believed to belong to Mr Carroll, police said.

Later, the same 'Kieran Carroll' profile commented again, saying, 'If any one is commenting and don't no me or what's really going on... stay out of my life you don't no me.'

It is understood that Mr Carroll attended Bedford College, Bedfordshire, and lives with his girlfriend, Louis' mother, at a home in Luton.

The 20-year-old woman is believed to have a three-year-old son from a previous relationship. 

Detective Inspector Sean Quinn replied to the Facebook post, saying: 'Kieran – Thank you for posting on our Facebook page.

'We are pleased to hear that you and Louis are safe.'

'All we need to do is see you and Louis in person to check you are safe and well. Please call us on 101 so we can arrange to meet you. We cannot close this case until we see you.' 

Found: Mr Carroll's disappearing act was said to be 'out of character'. Today he was arrested and bailed for assault and criminal damage - offences which allegedly committed on the day he went missing

Before the father came forward, another commenter on the Facebook page, Chantelle Louise White, said: 'You lot make out that he ant fine I know him for years and he won't do nuttin to he's son… He's looked after my son when he was the sane age! [sic]' 

And Mr Carroll's sister, Alix Carroll, 24, wrote: 'My brother is an amazing father - he has his boy more than the mother does. 

'He's scared he's going to lose him - it's no different to if it was the other way round.

'Never in a million years would he harm a hair on his body. He will be safe - I bet my life on it.'

Posting on Facebook, she added that she didn't know where her brother was, but that 'Louie is safe and there both okay [sic].'

Earlier, police described the father's disappearance as 'completely out of character' and said they were concerned because they thought Mr Carroll did not have any supplies for the baby.
