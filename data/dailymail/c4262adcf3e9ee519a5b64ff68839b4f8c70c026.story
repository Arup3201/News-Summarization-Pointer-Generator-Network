Arsenal have made an enquiry for Borussia Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos.

The 26-year-old centre-back only moved to Dortmund last summer from Werder Bremen but now has to compete with Mats Hummels, Neven Subotic and former Arsenal target Matthias Ginter who joined in July.

Dortmund paid £7.5million for Papastathopoulos but want close to £20million now as the window is so close to closing. Arsenal are understood to be willing to offer £12m plus add-ons.

Transfer: Arsenal are interested in signing defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Dortmund

The Gunners sold Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona earlier this summer and have, so far, only brought in Calum Chambers as a replacement.

While the 19-year-old has impressed, Arsenal are keen to secure a defender with more experience.  

Arsenal remain interested in Paris St Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot and Torino forward Alessio Cerci.

Arsenal have had an offer turned down already for Rabiot, 19, who has one year left on contract. His mother and agent Veronique Rabiot, was due in London yesterday for talks. 

Roma are considered Arsenal's main rivals. Juventus have an offer in place to take him next summer. 

Replacement: Arsenal still need to sign an experienced defender to replace Thomas Vermaelen

Unhappy: Arsenal are also interested in Adrien Rabiot, who is unhappy at French champions PSG
