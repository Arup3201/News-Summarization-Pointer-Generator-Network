Bisexual women have more health problems than people of any other sexual orientation, new research suggests (posed by model)

Bisexual women have more health problems than people of any other sexual orientation, new research suggests.

Compared to heterosexual people, bisexual men and homosexual people, bisexual women have more mental health problems, poorer general health and more sexually transmitted diseases, the researchers found.

However, the quality of life of gay and bisexual people - when compared with heterosexual people - has improved dramatically during the last decade.

The research was commissioned by the Norwegian Directorate of Children, Youth and Family Affairs.

‘The similarities are greater than the differences regarding quality of life. That suggests that the world is moving forward,’ said Dr Kirsti Malterud, one of the researchers behind the study.

‘The previous Norwegian report on quality of life from 1999 presented a dismal picture.’

The study revealed that the quality of life of gay and bisexual people is now similar to that of heterosexual people.

However, some bisexual women experience a lower quality of life than the rest.

‘We see signs of marginalisation and minority stress in a small group. This group has more mental health problems, poorer self-rated health, more sexually transmitted diseases, experiences loneliness and includes several suicide attempts. This applies to a minority, but it’s serious,’ said Dr Malterud.

The survey not only revealed that bisexual women are more likely to suffer chronic illness, but it also showed that many bisexual men and women hide their sexual orientation at work.

It showed that some 78 per cent of bisexual men and 68 per cent of bisexual women do not reveal their sexual orientation to their colleagues.

In contrast, only 18 per cent of gay men and nine per cent of gay women keep their sexuality under wraps at work.

‘The fact that some are struggling is related to the attitudes of those around them. Perhaps there’s little room in our culture for people who don’t want to call themselves heterosexuals, gays or lesbians. Have we reached our limit of tolerance by accepting gays and lesbians, but then that’s enough?’ asked Dr Malterud.

She added: ‘It’s not the case that it’s up to the individual to come out, this is a responsibility we all share.’

Shockingly, the report also showed that 16 per cent of the men in Norway would move away from a gay man on the bus.

Dr Malterud said: ‘I’ve been out as a lesbian since I was 28, and I’ve felt good about it. But I’m used to it being an issue, and that people form opinions when I talk about my girlfriends.

‘The 16 per cent who would move away is less than before, but still enough to make you unsure of people’s reactions if you come out. But we have to be pleased that there’s progress.’

Dr Malterud worked on the report entitled ‘Sexual Orientation and Quality of Life’ with Norman Anderssen, Mari Bjørkman, Tone Hellesund and Hilde Slåtten.
