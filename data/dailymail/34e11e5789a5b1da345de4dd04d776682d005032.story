A Russian speed skater thrilled spectators at the Sochi Olympics when she unzipped her racing suit down to the bellybutton, forgetting she was wearing nothing underneath.

Olga Graf had already given the home fans a 
reason to cheer after winning Russia's first medal when she took a 
surprising bronze in the women's 3,000 meters yesterday.

The 30-year-old was celebrating with a warm down lap when without thinking she unzipped her skin-tight suit risking an extremely embarrassing situation.

On thin ice: Russian speedskater Olga Graf unzips her racing suit after clinching a bronze medal at the Sochi Olympics - forgetting she was wearing nothing underneath

Fotunately she managed to avoid any major fallout and on realising her faux pas quickly zipped the suit back up with a mortified smile.

'I totally forgot,' Graf said sheepishly through a translator. 'We have very good suits and they are very tight. ... You just want to breathe and you want to take off your suit.'

'Only afterward,' she said, 'did I realize that maybe this video will appear on YouTube. But I don't think it will be so bad.'
