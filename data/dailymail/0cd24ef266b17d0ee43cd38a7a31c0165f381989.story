United Airlines is facing a $5million lawsuit from a female passenger, who alleges she was 'dragged' off a plane by police, then was in a county jail for three days.

Plaintiff Jean Mamakos twice attempted switching seats in Seattle on her way to Alaska for a ski trip and wanted to get some shut-eye, she told CBS New York.

'One of the stewardesses said "Oh no you don’t." Which stopped me in my tracks,' Mamakos told the affiliate station of her first start toward an empty row.

Plaintiff: Jean Mamakos, pictured, alleges police 'dragged' her off the plane after she decided not to pay extra money for a seat switch and went back to her original seat 

Mamakos claims her jeans were ripped during her encounter with police officers 

Mamakos also alleged that 'So I went forward [in the plane] and then another stewardess came along and said "Give me your credit card."'

CBS New York reported the empty emergency row seat came with a price tag of an extra $109.

Mamakos chose not to fork over the money - and while in her original seat 'heard the captain say "There is a lady that wants to get off the plane on this flight, so we have to wait,"' she told CBS New York. 

Mamakos also claimed that flight attendants 'said "You have to get off this plane." And I said "No, I paid for this seat and I’m going to stay here."' 

In taped footage  obtained by the television station, a responding police officer asks Mamakos 'Do you want to come willingly or be arrested for trespass?'

Encounter: A police officer asked Mamakos 'Do you want to come willingly or be arrested for trespass?' to which Mamako replied 'Whatever you have to do' 

Mamakos replies, 'Whatever you have to do.' The officer then says, 'Okay.' 

'They did handcuff me, there were three policemen that dragged me out of the plane,' Mamakos told CBS New York of the experience, alleging that the officers told her it was for 'trespassing.' 

Mamakos also said that the hefty cost of the tickets was the reason she withstood arrest. 

The courts were closed over the weekend, meaning Mamakos was in jail for three days, her attorney told the news outlet. 

The affiliate station reported that '[United Airlines] won't comment on the case, but said federal law requires pre-flight briefing for anyone seated in emergency rows, and added that balance and weight safety regulations prevent onboard seat changes.'
