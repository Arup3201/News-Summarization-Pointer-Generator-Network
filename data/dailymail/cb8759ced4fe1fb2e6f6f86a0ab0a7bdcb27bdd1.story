An NHS boss is on a pay deal worth £190,000-a-year to work as little as one day a week.

Christopher Langley was appointed chairman of Medway Foundation Trust after it was put into special measures.

Details of his contract reveal he is paid more than £170,000, plus another £17,000 in expenses, for working ‘an average of one or two days a week’.

Chris Langley has been employed on a deal worth almost £200,000 in pay and expenses to be chairman of Medway Foundation Trust which runs Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent

Health groups have condemned the huge deal, worth enough to pay for more than eight nurses.

The health watchdog Monitor appointed Mr Langley in February after the hospital trusts was found to have higher-than-expected death rates and failing on patient safety.

The one-year initial contract sets out how he is paid through a company, Trust and West Easton Consulting Ltd, of which he is a director.

He receives £14,400 in pay each month, plus expenses worth 10 per cent of his salary, at £1,440. Over a year it is worth £190,080. By comparison, Mr Langley’s predecessor received just £40,000 to £45,000.

Mr Langley’s contract states: ‘Remuneration will be paid at the rate of £12,000 plus VAT per month, invoiced monthly in advance to the Trust by WECL.

‘A fixed monthly amount of 10 per cent of the fee plus VAT will be charged to the Trust to cover expenses.

‘Under these terms, there is no entitlement to compensation for loss of office.’

The contract adds that he must devote ‘sufficient time to ensure satisfactory discharge’ of his duties.

‘This should be an average of one or two days a week (including time spent attending meetings and preparing for meetings of the Board or the Council of Governors either at Trust premises or elsewhere).’

Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, condemned the 'astonishing' pay deal

In addition to being a director and shareholder of West Eaton Consulting Ltd, Mr Langley is also a business partner at 38 Devonshire Street, a private dental practice in London.

He is a director of OM Interactive Ltd, which sells multi-sensory equipment, Asteral Ltd, which sells medical equipment to the NHS, and seminars@thirtyeight limited, which hosts public speakers at the dental practice.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, told the Telegraph: ‘It is alarming that such vast sums of money are being spent in this way.

‘At a time when the NHS is under such huge financial pressures, this type of waste is unacceptable.

’She added it was ‘shocking that such vast sums of money can be claimed without having to produce receipts.’

Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing said: “It’s astonishing to see how liberally the NHS is still prepared to dish out pay packages like this.

‘At a time when nurses are struggling to make ends meet, these are eye-watering sums of money.’

A spokesman for Monitor said: ‘When we took action in February, Medway was one of the most challenged foundation trusts in the country and faced a range of serious issues.

‘The trust needed the right people in place to make the urgent improvements needed for its patients, which is why the interim chair and chief executive were appointed.’
