A cattle farmer claimed today that the badger cull had ended his bovine tuberculosis nightmare that lasted more than ten years.

James Griffiths - whose land in Tibberton, Gloucestershire, lies within the controversial pilot area - said his dairy herd was free of TB for the first time since 2004.

The 48-year-old father-of-two claimed that this was because badgers carrying the disease had been killed in his area during culls over the past two years.

End of the nightmare: James Griffiths - whose land in Tibberton, Gloucestershire, lies within the controversial badger cull pilot area - said his dairy herd was free of TB for the first time since 2004

Farm: Mr Griffiths said being branded a ‘dirty herd’ for 11 years had cost his family farm ‘hundreds of thousands of pounds’ - and placed his family and staff under intolerable strain

The National Farmers’ Union insisted Mr Griffiths’s experience was being mirrored across Gloucestershire and Somerset as the number of TB cases start to fall in the badger cull areas.

But animal rights activists have disputed the claims made by NFU president Meurig Raymond at the organisation’s annual conference in Birmingham yesterday.

And the badger issue looks set to become a major political issue, with Environment Secretary Liz Truss telling farmers at the event that the Conservatives would extend the cull if re-elected.

Mr Raymond urged politicians not to make the cull 'a party political issue' in the run-up to the general election, and criticised Labour for pledging to give up on culling.

Moving forward: Mr Griffiths said his 1,700 strong herd was given a negative test for TB shortly after the second cull ended in November and the final all clear last Friday

Yesterday Mr Griffiths said his 1,700 strong herd was given a negative test for TB shortly after the second cull ended in November and the final all-clear last Friday.

Mr Griffiths said being branded a ‘dirty herd’ for 11 years had cost his family farm ‘hundreds of thousands of pounds’ - and placed his family and staff under huge strain.

He added: ‘I could hardly believe the results because I was starting to think we’d never get out of it. After all those years of frustration I can finally see light at the end of the tunnel.

‘It’s been a completely debilitating and disheartening experience that really grinds you down. Because I’ve been living under the shadow of TB for so long now, I’m not sure exactly what it will mean. I’m still coming blinking into the bright daylight.’

Cull: Mr Griffiths said it was 'clear the reservoir of infection was outside the herd in the badger population'

Mr Griffiths has had to manage the disease since taking over the family farm, which is in a TB hotspot along the border between Gloucestershire and Herefordshire.

Ministers and farmers insist culling is vital to tackle TB, which can be spread from badgers to livestock - with more than 26,000 cattle slaughtered in England last year and multimillion-pound losses.

But opponents say badger-culling is inhumane and ineffective, and alternatives such as vaccination should be pursued.

An independent expert panel found that controlled shooting of badgers in the cull's first year was not effective or humane.

In Gloucestershire just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot, falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in TB in livestock, leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there.

The Government claimed the low numbers in Gloucestershire reflected the 'challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation' by anti-cull campaigners.

In Somerset, the location of the other pilot cull, a sufficient number of badgers were killed this year to lead to expected reductions in TB in cattle, with 341 culled, in a required range of 316 to 785.

In both of the pilot areas, a significant proportion were killed by the more expensive cage trapping and shooting method - rather than 'controlled shooting' of free-running badgers.

He added: ‘I don’t know if we were the longest down, but at 11 years we must have been one of the longest. They tested every two months and every time they tested we would lose a few animals, seven or eight on average.

‘We just couldn’t seem to get free of it. I know Defra (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) were concerned because they carried out expensive blood tests on every animal to find out if there was a reservoir of disease in the herd. There wasn’t. 

'It was quite clear that the reservoir of infection was outside the herd in the badger population.’

Mr Griffiths’s farm was one of those in the 132 sq mile Gloscon pilot badger cull, where disruption was blamed for only 274 badgers being killed - instead of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in TB.

He alleged that balaclava-wearing saboteurs posted negative messages on Facebook, followed his 19-year-old daughter home and frightened his 88-year-old mother Cynthia.

‘It’s was all pretty low level intimidation but it’s one thing being nose to nose with somebody in a balaclava shouting at you, another when it affects your kids and your family,’ Mr Griffiths added.

Mr Raymond yesterday claimed incidents of TB had decreased in Somerset and Mr Griffiths’s case showed similar results could be expected in Gloucestershire.

But campaigners were not convinced - and Claire Bass, Humane Society International/UK’s executive director, called the cull an ‘very expensive, cruel and ineffective farce’.

She said: 'This cull fails our wildlife by subjecting badgers to inhumane shooting; it fails farmers by promising a solution to TB that simply doesn't work; and it fails the public by wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.’
