A bid by a triple killer to win release from prison under a human rights ruling was last night greeted with outrage by his victims.

Arthur Hutchinson was sentenced to a whole-life tariff after stabbing a bride’s parents and brother to death on her wedding night and raping a teenage guest.

But the 73-year-old has become the first Briton to launch a bid for freedom after European Court of Human Rights judges last month decided that ‘life-means-life’ sentences are unlawful.

Challenge: Triple killer and rapist Arthur Hutchinson, now 73, is demanding the right to seek parole

Yesterday the decision was attacked by
 the family of Basil and Avril Laitner and their son Richard, who were 
murdered by Hutchinson in 1983.

They
 said in a statement: ‘Whenever even the name Arthur Hutchinson rears 
its ugly head, it does nothing but create fear and distress to the 
victims of this heinous crime.

'Let the human rights judiciary members be
 thrust into our position for just a day and maybe they would understand
 this.

‘We are confident 
that justice will be done and more importantly, be seen to be done, so 
that this matter can finally be put to rest.’

The
 Government has been asked to provide an official response to 
Hutchinson’s claim, which could lead to a full hearing next year.

The killers who launched the challenge were Jeremy Bamber (left), Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore. At the time of the ruling, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (right) said the original authors of the Human Rights Convention 'would be turning in their graves'

Dominic
 Raab MP, who is campaigning for reform of human rights legislation, 
said: ‘You couldn’t get a better example of a case where life should 
mean life.

‘UK democratic 
accountability over our criminal justice system is yet again being 
threatened by the insatiable appetite of the Strasbourg court.’

The
 human rights ruling came after a challenge by three killers including 
Jeremy Bamber, who shot dead five members of his family in 1985.

The judges said whole-life terms were ‘inhuman and degrading’ and demanded that cases should be reviewed after 25 years.

The
 judgment cleared the way for early release bids by Britain’s 49 
whole-life prisoners – including notorious felons such as Rose West and 
Dennis Nilsen.

be reviewed after 25 years

However, it 
is thought ministers will do nothing to apply the ruling in Britain.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said yesterday: ‘I continue to strongly
 believe that whole-life tariffs are appropriate for the worst murder 
cases.’

Hutchinson killed 
solicitor Mr Laitner, 59, and his 55-year-old wife after breaking into 
their home in Dore, Sheffield, hours after the family had celebrated the
 wedding of their daughter Suzanne.

He killed their son Richard before 
tying up and raping an 18-year-old woman.

Hutchinson,
 from Hartlepool, lost a challenge against his sentence five years ago, 
when the Court of Appeal ruled there was ‘no reason at all’ to depart 
from the whole-life tariff.
