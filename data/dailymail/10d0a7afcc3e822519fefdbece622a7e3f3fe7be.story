He seemed somewhat out of place amid the traditional, old-fashioned ceremony of Changing the Guard.

But this heavily armed soldier in combat fatigues proved every bit as much of an attraction to the camera-wielding tourists at Horse Guards Parade in London yesterday.

Troops with machine guns have been deployed alongside their red-clad sword-bearing comrades as a security measure following the shooting of a ceremonial guard outside the Canadian parliament.

On guard: Armed soldiers carrying assault rifles were seen on the streets of Westminster yesterday as the military boosted security measures in the aftermath of the attack on the Canadian parliament last week

Duty: Soldiers from The Blues and Royals dressed in camouflage uniforms and carrying assault rifles were photographed walking past tourists gathered outside the entrance to Horse Guards Parade yesterday

Thousands of visitors gather at Horse Guards Parade in Whitehall each morning to witness Changing the Guard.

The entrance, part of the Buckingham Palace estate and open to the public during the day, is usually guarded by two men in tunic on horseback and two on foot. But the buildings are also the headquarters of the Army’s London District and provide accommodation for soldiers in the Queen’s Life Guard, a unit which carries out ceremonial duties and performs on state occasions.

Attraction: Although popular with tourists, Horse Guards Parade is a working military barracks where soldiers, including The Life Guards - one of whom is seen in here the red tunic - live and work

Vigilent: As with other military bases, soldiers are permanently on guard at the entrance but since Monday these troops from the Household Cavalry Regiment have been more prominent

Senior officers made the decision to deploy armed troops there after Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, was shot dead by an Islamist fanatic a week ago while on unarmed guard duty at the National War Memorial in Ottawa.

His killer, Muslim convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was shot dead by Kevin Vickers, the Sergeant-At-Arms, when he stormed the parliament, firing a shot into the door of the room where Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper was hiding in a cupboard.

Yesterday, a senior Army source said: ‘A decision was made by the local commander. They’ve probably looked at what happened in Canada and thought, “I’ll stick someone out there with a rifle as a bit of a deterrent in case anyone has got bad ideas”.

‘It’s a long time since there was an armed guard at Horse Guards Parade.’ 

Threat: The UK's terror threat level was raised from 'substantial' to 'severe' - meaning an attack is highly likely - in late August amid fears of a terrorist strike linked to Islamic State or another extremist group

Alert:  The MoD said security security arrangements were regularly reviewed at all of its establishments

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘The MoD routinely reviews the security arrangements at all of its establishments. Clearly we do not comment publicly on the substance of these.’

The security review comes as Westminster is on high alert in case of a terrorist attack on Parliament.

MPs are being told to consider fitting their constituency offices with panic buttons and designating a ‘safe room’ in their homes.

They are also being briefed on the security plans in case of an attack on the Commons.

‘In the event of an incident involving firearms or other weapons, the police will take operational control. Firearms officers are deployed on the parliamentary estate and will respond to such incidents,’ the advice says. ‘If you hear gunfire, move away; but consider barricading yourself and others in a room if danger is close.’

Scotland Yard is already reviewing the Prime Minister’s security after a jogger ran into David Cameron on Monday as he left Leeds Civic Hall, sparking a major alert.

Last night a Metropolitan Police spokesman declined to comment on whether police security arrangements had been stepped up in the wake of the Canadian attack.
