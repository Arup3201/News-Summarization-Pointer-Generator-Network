Schools will no longer be required in law to maintain a specific amount of space on their playing fields for team sports under rules brought in on the eve of the Olympics.

Education Secretary Michael Gove has scrapped regulations which dictate how much space schools should provide for their pupils for team games.

New rules state merely that ‘suitable’ outdoor space must be provided for sport and play.

Thing of the past? Schools will no longer be required to maintain a specific amount of space on their playing fields for team sports under rules brought in on the eve of the Olympics

The move calls into question the Coalition’s strategy on school sport and building a lasting Olympic legacy which boosts competitive games.

Critics warned that more playing fields could now be sold off, undermining the Coalition’s commitment to strengthening competitive sport.

David Cameron recently pledged to put sports such as netball, tennis and football on the national curriculum for primary school children and said the ethos of schools must change so pupils learn that ‘winning and losing is an important part of growing up’.

The new rules on school playing fields were drawn up on July 19, laid before Parliament on July 30 and come into force in October.

Under current regulations, dating from 1999, schools are expected to follow detailed rules on outdoor space laid down in a table which is enshrined in law.

Primary schools with fewer than 200 pupils, for example, should set aside 30 square yards or 25 square metres of ‘game playing field’ for every child.

Larger primaries must set aside 50 square yards, or 42 square metres. Secondary schools must set aside up to 60 square yards, or 50 square metres, depending on its size.

But a recent Government consultation found many state schools were struggling to meet the requirements and suggested they be modified.

School sport has proved a tricky issue for the Coalition during the Olympics after it emerged that it has scrapped a target for schools to provide two hours of PE a week.

It also emerged that Mr Gove has sanctioned the disposal of 22 playing fields, although most were at schools that had closed or were merging.

The Department for Education said it would soon consult on a new minimum requirement for playing field space, which would be simpler than the current ‘bureaucratic’ table of ratios. This would be non-binding guidance.

Officials insisted the new policy states for the first time that all schools must have access to suitable outdoor space for both formal PE lessons and for outdoor play, rather than simply team sport.

But Alison Moore-Gwyn, of the charity 
Fields In Trust, warned that playing fields could be cut back and called
for a ‘firm commitment from the Government to prioritise school sport 
and facilities’.

Tim Lamb, 
chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, an umbrella 
organisation for sports bodies, said the old regulations had been a ‘key
tool’ in preventing playing fields being sold.

‘Without
a minimum requirement, the danger is that short-term expediency could 
jeopardise the ability of schools to deliver sport for future 
generations,’ he said.

Labour
education spokesman Stephen Twigg said: ‘This just shows how out of 
touch Michael Gove is.

'Not satisfied with getting rid of the target of 
pupils playing two hours of sport a week, he is now weakening the 
standards Labour introduced to protect school playing fields.

‘If we are to ensure the Olympic legacy, the Government must ensure that schools provide a decent amount of space for competitive sports and play.’

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘These regulations set out for the first time that all schools must have access to suitable outdoor space for both formal PE lessons and for outdoor play.

‘By removing pages and pages of bureaucratic restrictions we will make it easier and cheaper to provide the badly needed extra school places that this country needs so urgently.

‘Our extremely strict rules on playing fields will stay firmly in place. This Government has only approved sales if the school has closed, has merged or if equal or better facilities are being put in their place.’
