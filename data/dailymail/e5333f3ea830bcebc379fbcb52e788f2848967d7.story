Floyd Mayweather will fight Manny Pacquiao next year, his father Floyd Snr has claimed.

The much-hyped megafight could generate as much as $300million but Mayweather and Pacquiao have repeatedly failed to agree terms.

Although, judging from his latest video which shows him counting his cash, The Money Man has little need for another pay day.

Mayweather Snr told fighthype.com: 'It's gonna happen. That fight's gonna happen. Trust me.

'That fight's definitely gonna happen. It's a fight for the world, man, right there. It's the biggest fight that has ever been in life, so like I said, man, that fight's gonna happen.

'[I'll] tell you right now, he never told me the fight's gonna happen, but the fight's gonna happen. You mark my words, and we'll see.'

Mayweather has repeatedly taken to social media to show his wealth and on Thursday posted a video showing piles of notes piled neatly on a table, along with the message: 'I'm spending all this money at my favourite store, Devannah Love Boutique.'

The Las Vegas store is described as a one-stop shop for women's fashion and beauty needs and is owned by Melissia Brim, the mother of one of Mayweather's four children.

Mayweather insists he will retire next year at the end of his six-fight deal with Showtime. Victories in May and September would leave the 37-year-old with a record of 49 wins from 49 fights.

Another possible opponent is Britain's Amir Khan, who missed out to Marcos Maidana last May.

And Mayweather revealed on Thursday he wants to take on the 27-year-old from Bolton, if only to appease his dad, who is keen for him to take the fight.

He said: 'My Dad is desperate for me to take - the Khan fight - he just wants me to shut the kid up and put him down.

'My Dad doesn't like fighters trash talking his son - but he knows as well as I do that if the fight happens - then I am going to punish him. If he thinks he can trash talk me and get away with it he needs to think again.

'He (Khan) is a good fighter - he has quick hands - but I am a far more intelligent fighter than him... and I could already tell you how I would beat him.'
