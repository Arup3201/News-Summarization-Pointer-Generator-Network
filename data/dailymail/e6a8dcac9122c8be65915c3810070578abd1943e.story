A hospital in Holland has developed a breakthrough treatment for burns patients.

Patients with severe burns usually need to be sedated so they can bear the pain. However, this has downsides because the drugs can interfere with other aspects of the treatment.

Martini Hospital in Groningen, Holland, has developed a new pain management system that does not involve extra medication. 

Instead, the patient plays a video game using virtual reality glasses during the treatment of his wounds.

Tests have shown that the patient’s pain threshold is higher when they are being distracted.
