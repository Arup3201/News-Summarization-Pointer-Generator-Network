A former Alabama high school teacher sentenced to six months in jail for having sex with a 14-year-old student recorded an astonishing apology on YouTube just hours before she was due in jail.

Alicia Gray, 28, was convicted last Friday and filmed a statement shortly afterwards in which she claimed to have been changed by God.

It was introduced by Dr Mark Wyatt, a pastor at religious organisation Deeper Life Fellowship, which helped to produce the video.

He said: ‘She’s had her identity redefined in the context of the fact that she’s a daughter of God.’

Gray, filmed while sitting on a bench, 
explained that she’s sorry for her ‘selfish actions’ and the choices she
 made ‘out of insecurity and hurt’.

She
 continued: ‘I’m thankful that God has changed me, so i won't make those
 same selfish decisions. I no longer have to feel shame about the person
 that I once was and never will be again.

‘God
 gives us overwhelming peace when you know who you are. God gives me 
that security of knowing I'm not that person any more. I had pain in my 
own heart and a void that I thought i needed to fill through attention, 
and that void was just needing Jesus.’

She
 also read out the statement she gave in court in which she stated that 
she wanted to apologise for her ‘very selfish actions’.

She
 said: ‘I realise that I've hurt many people. The person I was has gone 
thanks to the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ. Everyone who I've hurt is
 constantly in my prayers.’

Gray
 accepted a plea deal by prosecutors as she was convicted of engaging in
 a sexual act or deviant sexual intercourse with a student under 19 
years old.

She was sentenced to serve six months behind bars with five years of probation.

As
 a condition of the probation, Gray will no longer be allowed to be 
employed with minors, and was required to surrender her teaching 
certificate to the Alabama Department of Education at once.

The
 former math teacher at Mary G. Montgomery surrendered to the Mobile 
County Sheriff’s Office in February of last year and charged with 
second-degree sodomy, sexual abuse and being a school employee who has 
had sexual contact with a student younger than 19.

It was alleged that her victim was 14 years old at the time of the incident.

The
 student told investigators his relationship with Gray started around 
New Year's Day 2013 and became more serious, ultimately leading to 'an 
exchange of oral sex' near or at the victim's home.

The boy also told police Gray 'took several nude pictures' of herself and sent them to him via cell phone.

She had been on paid administrative since her arrest, but she resigned from the school system several months ago.

'We
 regret any circumstance like this, but when the allegations came out, 
we acted quickly. We deeply regret this ever happened,' schools 
Superintendent Martha Peek said in a statement.

At the time of her arrest, Gray was accompanied by her husband 
and attorney when she surrendered herself to authorities at Mobile 
County Metro Jail, after a warrant had been issued for her arrest and an
 investigation into the relationship was launched.

Popular teacher: Former students off Gray said they were shocked by the allegations

On the MGM High School's website, Gray described herself as 'highly qualified in mathematics.'

Former students said they were shocked by the allegations.

'She's really cool,' said former student Matt Boykin. 'I had her class when I was in ninth grade. I struggled with math a lot, and she really helped me.'

Gray had graduated from Mary G 
Montgomery High school and went on to pursue a bachelor degree in 
mathematics education from the University of Mobile in May 2007.

She then received her master’s degree in teaching and learning from Nova Southeastern University in May 2011.
