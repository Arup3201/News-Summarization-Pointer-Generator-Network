An exercise-loving mother-of-three claims she was blocked from Facebook after launching a tirade against a group of plus-size women who posed in lingerie to promote body confidence.

Maria Kang, 32, from California, wrote on the site last Friday that she was 'annoyed' by 'news stories about how overweight, nearly obese women should be proud of their bodies' - referring directly to a story by MailOnline highlighting a 'selfie' photo campaign launched by Curvy Girl Lingerie.

The post, which reportedly received thousands of 'Likes' from her 230,000 followers, was deemed a 'hate speech' by Facebook Ms Kang says, and she was locked out of her account as a result.

Keeping fit and healthy: Exercise-loving mother-of-three, Maria Kang, claims she was blocked from Facebook after launching a tirade against a group of plus-size women who posed in lingerie to promote body confidence

Her access to the social network was restored after two days, but her post was not.

Miss Kang – who was accused of ‘fat 
shaming’ when she posted a portrait of herself in workout gear online 
last month along with the caption ‘what’s your excuse?’ - said she did 
not intend to upset people and was merely 'telling the truth.'

'We
 need to change this strange mentality we are breeding in the U.S. and 
start celebrating people who are a result of hard work, dedication and 
discipline'

She says the online campaign launched by Chrystal Bougon, the owner of California plus-size shop Curvy Girl Lingerie, 'normalizes being unhealthy.'

However, Ms Bougon says her intention is show that 'women with rolls, bumps [and] lumps . . . can be stunning and beautiful' too.

Unenthused by the photo project, Ms Kang continued: 'We need to change this strange mentality we are breeding in the U.S. and start celebrating people who are a result of hard work, dedication and discipline.

'I’m not bashing those who are proud and overweight, I am empowering those who are proud and healthy to come out and be the real role models in our society.' 

Body confidence: In a bid to celebrate 'real beauty' without the magic of Photoshop, Ms Bougon appealed to women who are U.S. size 14 or up to post 'sexy' selfies on her professional Facebook page

But Ms  Kang wrote on Facebook last Friday that she was 'annoyed' by 'stories about how overweight should be proud of their bodies' - referring directly to  the Curvy Girl Lingerie campaign (above)

Many of Ms Kang's fans backed her up. One wrote: 'You got blocked because people can't handle the truth!'

And
 another added: 'I don't know how many of your comments you actually get
 to read when you have so many, but I will say this . . . as a former 
seriously obese woman I am behind you speaking the truth 100%.

'I'm not bashing those who are proud and overweight, I am empowering those who are proud and healthy to come out'

'Loving
 your body is one thing, but when you are overweight you really don't 
love yourself. It's impossible when you are killing yourself with every 
bite you take.'

But another was less impressed with 
Miss Kang's views, writing: 'Un-liking this girl now. She's gotten so 
annoying. She is semi-rude to people who are overweight. Posting stuff 
like this gives you the "oh poor you" "you're the victim in all this" 
that you're craving.

'It makes her annoying and judgmental. I think I'd rather be fat and happy than in shape and annoying like her.'

And Ms Bougon who launched the Curvy Girl Lingerie campaign told Yahoo: 'Everyone is entitled to their opinion.

Venting her rage: Ms Kang said that she received an email from Facebook stating that her post referencing the Curvy Girl Lingerie campaign violated community standards

'But my page is our little space in the cyber world. If you don’t like what we are doing, move on to the next page.;

Ms Kang said that she received an email from Facebook stating that her post referencing the Curvy Girl Lingerie campaign violated community standards.

The message read: 'Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and humorous speech.

'As a former obese woman I am behind you speaking the truth 100%. When you are overweight you really don't love yourself'

'While we encourage you to challenge ideas, 
institutions, events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or 
groups to attack others based on their race, ethnicity, national origin,
 religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or medical 
condition.'

The tech giant later admitted that the content had been 'mistakenly removed' after another user reported it.

A
 spokesperson said in a statement to News10.com: 'When we realized the 
error we corrected it immediately, and restored full access to Ms Kang. 
We apologize for the inconvenience.'

It isn't the first time Ms Kang, who runs a fitness-focused non-profit organization from home, has courted controversy with her strong views on healthy living.

Last month the public were less 
supportive when she posted a photograph of her toned post-baby body to 
Facebook, captioned 'What's your excuse?'

The
 photo, which Ms Kang has since used as her profile picture, shows her 
knelt alongside her three young sons, dressed in a workout bra and 
matching micro shorts.

While many commentators cited her as an 'inspiration' some also accused her of being 'insulting', 'obnoxious' and a 'fat shaming bully'.

Indeed, one woman wrote: 'You are . . . hurtful to women and think way too much of yourself. Disgusting is what you are!'

And a mother-of-two named Sarah added on Ms Kang's website, mariakang.com: 'I hope you realize why some people are not just offended, but also hurt by your post as well.'
