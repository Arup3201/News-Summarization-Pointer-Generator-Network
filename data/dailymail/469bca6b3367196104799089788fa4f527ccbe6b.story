Suspect: Nikolai Rakossi, nicknamed the 'Russian Rambo', fled the U.S. before the bodies of his lover and her daughter were found stabbed to death

A suspected double murderer nicknamed 'Russian Rambo' has been allowed to cheat justice and start a new life because of chronic red tape between Washington and Moscow, the victims' closest relative says.

Nurse Tatyana Prikhodko, 56, and her glamorous daughter Larisa, 28, were stabbed to death in their New York home in April last year in a case that shocked America. 

Before their blood-soaked bodies were discovered, Tatyana's bearded husband Nikolai Rakossi, 58, a former Soviet paratrooper, fled the US on an Aeroflot plane to Moscow.

Now her other daughter Svetlana 
Prikhodko, 31, has spoken exclusively to Mail Online to express her 
despair that nothing is being done to detain Rakossi - seen as the only 
suspect - as surprising new details have emerged of the case.

She
believes he is being hidden by family and friends in Russia, possibly 
in the grim industrial city of Novomoskovsk, where he owns an apartment 
and where one neighbour claims to have seen him since the double 
killing.

'I
have no doubt it was him, none at all,' said the neighbour, asking to 
remain anonymous for her own safety. 'He looked worried and tense.'

The
fear is Rakossi has now totally vanished and will never be found by the
time an Interpol request for Russia to arrest him is finally issued.

Releasing
new family pictures in a bid to keep attention on the case, she said: 
'As you can see, ten months have not yielded any action in regards to 
arresting Rakossi.

'We have tried through multiple sources to expedite the processing of the evidence but it is still being evaluated.

Svetlana, right, has said nothing is being done to detain the man she 
believes is responsible

'The US needs to have a complete case in
order to send it to Russia and there is absolutely no timeline on when 
it could be happening.

'I speak with the District Attorney's
office almost on a weekly bases and they keep insisting that so much 
work has been completed already but once again, until they have the 
results for absolutely everything, they will not take the case to the 
grand jury for indictment. 

'We are just told to wait and as mad as that makes me, there is nothing that could be done.'

Without an indictment, she has been told, the US cannot issue an Interpol demand for Rakossi to be arrested.

Meanwhile new details have emerged which make the family doubt that it was simple family brawl that developed into an ugly killing. 

'The facts point to something far 
darker and more sinister than anyone could have imagined,' said a source
close to the family and concerned at the lack of progress.

Concerns
have even been voiced that his entire life in the US may have been a 
cover story for other, perhaps criminal, activities.

Stunning: It is believed that Larisa Prikhodko, pictured, walked in on her mother and Rakossi arguing

Victim: Sources suggested Rakossi had a secret life that was discovered by the two women. Larisa is pictured

It is claimed that on the day of the murders Rakossi was repeatedly on the phone to Russia, both before and after the killings. It is assumed that the police have the numbers.

'Rakossi made almost 20 phone calls to Russia, starting at 5:30 am, though typically he seldom called anyone,' said the source.

'The calls were only briefly interrupted at 2:40 pm for ten minutes when he committed the first murder. He then resumed calling until 3:40 pm when Larisa walked in, resulting in, another ten minute interruption in the calls.

'Afterwards, he continued dialling until he boarded the flight the following evening. Who was he calling and why?

Doting: Tatyana and Larisa leave behind Larisa's daughter Ryan, 3, who was with her father at the time

'What secret, besides the two bodies of his "family" did he take with him when he boarded Aeroflot at 7 pm on April 17?'

One theory is that Tatyana may have stumbled on some secret about him, and that a worried Rakossi had called Moscow for orders on how to react.

'The quiet, subdued Rakossi was living a double life ever since the moment he landed in the US, or this is now how it seems,' said the source.

'Arriving on a tourist visa, he charmed Tatyana who was already a US citizen after arriving to live the American dream, and soon asked her to marry him and became part of the family.

'The family did not have a clear 
picture of what Rakossi was doing during these 11 years. He never held a
regular job and claimed that he did construction work on the side. Yet he annually went back to Russia where he had an apartment and a car.'

Unanswered: Sources say Rakossi was on his phone for hours before and after the killings - and question why

The killings were carried out clinically, without a single scream to alert neighbours in the block.

'Who was this Rakossi that he allegedly knew how to handle a knife so expertly and kill an adult without even a cry from the victim?

'And what animal must he be to murder a young mother as she opened the door to her mother's apartment an hour later? What possible monstrous force and deed could have caused such an act of violence?

'No one deserves the horrible end that Larisa and Tatyana met.'
