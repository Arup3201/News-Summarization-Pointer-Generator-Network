Gareth Southgate has been forced to issue an embarrassing apology after an administrative error by the FA meant Manchester United defender Michael Keane was blocked from playing for England Under 21s against Wales in midweek.

FA officials declared an 'admin error' less than an hour before kick-off on Wednesday at Derby's iPro Stadium because they had registered Michael's twin brother Will, also at United, even though the forward was not meant to be selected for the side.

Michael was subsequently dropped from Southgate’s side, with Nathaniel Chalobah called up to the centre of England’s defence.

Michael has joined Blackburn Rovers on loan for the rest of the season, it was announced on Friday.

Southgate told the Daily Telegraph: 'We had an admin error so Michael wasn’t registered.

'I don’t know exactly why yet, it’s not one I’ve seen before.

'I really feel for the lad because he’s key to what we’re doing. But we adapted to that, with Nathaniel going in, who was very composed, and these are things you’ll face along the way.'It’s important that the team reacted the way that they did and did it so smoothly.'

Southgate, who saw his side win 1-0 over Wales courtesy of Nathan Redmond's goal, also revealed that Roy Hodgson may hand two under-21 players a place on the plane to Brazil.

Southgate said: 'There is the possibility Roy might take a couple of youngsters for the experience.

'That is something Roy is thinking about, taking a couple of younger players to give them experience of just being around it.'

Future: The likes of Jack Butland (above) may be on the plane to Brazil to gain tournament experience

Youth: Luke Shaw played against Denmark for the senior side on Wednesday, and is also in contention
