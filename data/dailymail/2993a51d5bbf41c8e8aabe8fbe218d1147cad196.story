A U.S. production company has launched a desperate online search to help the father of a boy who penned a touching note about his son who suffers from cystic fibrosis.

North Carolina-based Horizon Productions received the letter from 'Lee of Australia' asking for a DVD of the Disney TV show Kirby Buckets for his son to watch while he is in hospital.

But Lee sent the letter to the wrong company, so Horizon employee Ben Park posted a picture of the letter to Reddit in an effort to track the right company down and get a DVD to Lee's son.

Lee, who lives in a caravan park Brisbane, wrote that his son has limited opportunity to move around because of his illness.

He added that his son has seen clips of the show online. No DVDs have been officially released yet and the show is available on iTunes in the U.S. but not Australia.

'He gets really ill at times and spends time in hospital he loves the show and he watched a trailer on YouTube,' Lee wrote.

'We are waiting for a double lung transplant which will make his life a lot better.

'We have what we call a happy wall in the ward at hospital where kids and parents put names on smiling faces of people and companies who make the children forget about their illness and smile and laugh awhile so could you help us by sending us a copy of "Kirby Buckets".'

Mr Park, 29, said he received the letter last month but decided to post it online on Thursday (Wednesday US time) because it had stuck with him.

'More and more as I read through it, it seems like a desperate plea from a father trying to bring some amount of joy into his son's life,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I felt what he felt because I just had my first child - a boy - in the summer and I just wanted to do whatever I could do to help this father.

'He's in pain seeing his child go through this, especially through the Christmas holiday.' 

Mr Park added that he was able to contact the owner of Titmouse Animation, which does the cartoons for the show, but said he had not heard back from the show's producers.

'He said that he would forward it on to the showrunners of "Kirby Buckets",' Mr Park said.

'Showrunners can be extremely busy so I don't know if this letter will actually reach them or not.'

Mr Park clarified that: 'This isn't a marketing scheme or a grab for karma.'

People who suffer from cystic fibrosis develop an abnormal amount of excessively thick and sticky mucus within the lungs, airways and the digestive system, according to Cystic Fibrosis Australia.

'The mucus causes impairment of the digestive functions of the pancreas and traps bacteria in the lungs resulting in recurrent infections which lead to irreversible damage,' the organisation's website states.
