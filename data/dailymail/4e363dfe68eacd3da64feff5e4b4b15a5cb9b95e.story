Wladimir Klitschko completed his 17th consecutive title defence as he knocked out Kubrat Pulev inside five rounds in Hamburg on Saturday night.

The IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight champion floored his opponent twice in the opening round and it looked like it could be a brief encounter in the opening stages.

Pulev was on the floor again in the third but once again got to his feet before a huge left hook from Klitschko in the fifth handed the Bulgarian his first defeat in 21 fights and Klitschko extended his record to 63-3 with the 53rd knockout of his career.

Pulev tested Klitschko with a stiff jab in the opening stages and the crowd were clearly behind him but the Ukrainian responded in brilliant fashion, flooring his opponent with a left hook to the chin.

The Bulgarian got up off the floor but moments later he was down again, although it appeared to be a shove from Klitschko, and he rose again to make it through to the end of the round.

Klitschko had the better of the second as Pulev kept his distance but the challenger appeared to have recovered before he was put down again in the third. 

The world champion flew out of the blocks and the writing was always on the wall for Pulev

Pulev was unbeaten in his 20 previous contests before being battered by Klitschko

A right hand staggered Pulev and it was the left hook again that sent him to the canvas with the durable 33-year-old once more getting back to his feet with a cut below the left eye.

Pulev again appeared to recover and was trying to get inside in the fourth but he was not hurting Klitschko who appeared to be landing shots at will.

And the biggest of all came with 49 seconds remaining in the fifth as Klitschko landed the best left hook of the lot and Pulev was sent sprawling to the canvas for the fourth and final time.
