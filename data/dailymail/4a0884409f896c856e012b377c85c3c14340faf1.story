Gabriel Paulista waved a tearful goodbye to Villarreal fans on Saturday as he closes in on a £15million move to Arsenal. 

The Yellow Submarine confirmed on Twitter that a deal with the Gunners had been agreed on Saturday evening, shortly before their Primera Division match against Levante kicked off at El Madrigal.

And the 24-year-old said his final farewells to the La Liga side at the half-way point during the 1-0 win, and was visibly emotional as he was presented with a yellow submarine as a farewell present.

After the match Villarreal boss Marcelino admitted he was surprised at the news saying: 'Gabriel’s departure surprised us all because we didn’t expect to make changes to the squad [in January].

'From a sporting point of view it's unfortunate, but neither the club nor the player could afford to resist Arsenal's offer. 

'I wish him the greatest professional success of course.

'We'll now seek a new centre-back. We have the resources to replace Gabriel, but finding a replacement won't be easy because the level of demand [in top players] is increasing.'

As part of the deal the La Liga side have acquired Gunners striker Joel Campbell, with Marcelino pleased with the versatility he will bring to the table.

He added: '[Joel Campbell] is an interesting signing for Villarreal because he can play several positions and has a different profile to the players we already have.'
