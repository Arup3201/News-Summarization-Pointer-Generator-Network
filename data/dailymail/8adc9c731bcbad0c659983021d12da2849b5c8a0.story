Alice Gross was last seen when she left her home in Hanwell, west London at lunchtime on Thursday

A 14-year-old girl suffering from an ongoing health problem has been missing for three days, prompting her mother to issue a desperate appeal.

Alice Gross was last seen when she left her home in Hanwell, west London, on Thursday at about 1pm. The schoolgirl told her parents that she would be home at 6pm that night - but has not been seen since.

On the Find Alice Gross Facebook page, her mother Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, said: 'Alice, if you can see
this, please know sweetheart that all of us love you and miss you desperately.

‘You may be sad, you may be angry, you may be hurt, you may
be scared too. I just want to hug and hold you. Know that we love you and are
there for you whatever you are going through. My love, please get in touch and let someone know you are
safe. Alice, please come home.’

Alice is described as being 5ft 2in 
tall, of slim build with shoulder length, light brown hair. Alice was 
last seen wearing dark blue jeans, a dark green lacy cardigan and denim 
blue Vans shoes. She may have tartan-framed spectacles with her.

It
 is understood that she was last heard from at 3pm on Thursday - two 
hours after she left her home. Alice, who is a student at Brentside High
 School in Ealing, left the family home without her money, bank cards 
and Oyster travel card.

The girl's father Jose, 60, who teaches sound engineering and music production at The Recording Workshop in North Kensington, west London, praised the public's support in finding her, saying the family 'definitely don't feel alone'.

He added: ‘Unfortunately Alice is still missing. The police are still searching and following some leads. We've had helicopters searching last night and the night before. Sniffer dogs also.

'An amazing number of local people have been printing and putting up posters including printers and estate agents. There are over 2,000 members of the Find Alice Gross group.’

Alice's sister Nina Gross posted these two photographs of the missing schoolgirl on Facebook yesterday

Her sister Nina Gross, who is believed
 to be starting at Cambridge University this year, said on Facebook that
 Alice's phone appeared to be off and that her friends had not heard 
from her.

She added: ‘Thank 
you everyone for all your support and sharing, please keep it up. It's 
very important to spread the word... Thank you again, hopefully she will
 be found soon.’

The Metropolitan Police described her disappearance as
 'very out of character' and said she had not done this before. A spokesman appealed for anyone who recognised Alice to contact them urgently.

Last night police were probing an unconfirmed sighting of a girl who could have been Alice, but said 
that they were still looking for her.

Dog handlers and specialist officers searched parks and cemeteries near Alice's home yesterday. And local residents reported seeing a police helicopter over the Hanwell area today.

The police spokesman said: 'We are especially
 concerned about Alice who has not been in good health recently.' She 
added: 'We still want her to come home'.

'Alice, if you can see this, please know sweetheart that all of us love you and miss you desperately'

Officers are conducting extensive inquires, including searches and house-to-house inquiries in the Hanwell area. On the Find Alice Gross Facebook page,
 Nina Gross wrote that police had asked people to 'hold off any 
non-police searches, as they are actively searching certain areas this 
morning, until further notice.'

She encouraged people to raise awareness by sharing Alice's details online and putting up posters.

Presenters Jake Humphrey and Graham Norton and entrepreneur Duncan Bannatyne are among thousands of people to have retweeted or otherwise supported appeals for Alice's safe return.

Anyone who has seen Alice or has 
information that may help should call officers from 
Ealing Missing Persons Unit on 020 8246 1018 or 101. Alternatively call 
the charity Missing People on 116000.
