Queensland police have seized a guitar signed by AC/DC, a motorbike, $100,000 cash and a bag of gold jewellery hidden in an apartment wall during a two-day search warrant.

The crime squad searched a Parkwood property and a Broadbeach unit, both Gold Coast suburbs in southeastern Queensland, as part of a major investigation into a gang which allegedly transports cannabis from Victoria to Queensland on domestic flights.

Police also believe one of the primary syndicate members is also continuing to commit burglary and property offences.

Police say they found a significant amount of industrial tools, computer equipment, a motorcycle, bicycles, gold jewellery, $94,000 in cash and a guitar autographed by AC/DC.

Police say the items were secreted in the walls and a refrigerator of the Parkwood address.

Consequently, a 30-year-old Parkwood man has been charged with break and enter and possession of tainted property offences. He is expected to appear before the Southport Magistrates Court next week.

A 39-year-old man, also from Parkwood, has been charged with similar charges and is expected to face the Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday.

Anyone who may recognise the recovered property and believe they are the rightful owner of any of the items should contact Policelink on 131 444.
