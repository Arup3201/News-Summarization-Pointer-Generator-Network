German Chanellor Angela Merkel is the subject of a ruthless parody in the Ukrainian social media comparing her with Joachim von Ribbentrop for her supposed over-close relations to Moscow and specifically Vladimir Putin.

Pictures are mocking her recent meeting with the Kremlin leader at the World Cup Final in Rio de Janeiro, accusing her of being the block to potent EU sanctions against Moscow because of German gas needs.

'Danke, Frau Ribbentrop', reads one sarcastic message that has gone viral on the Ukrainian web.

Another message read 'Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact No. 2'.

Images show her face morphed onto that of Von Ribbentrop, a former German ambassador to London, who was co-author with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov of the notorious German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of August 23, 1939.

The hostile messages posted on Frau Merkel's official site led to a warning that she was under 'spam' attack, yet the anger is palpable - fuelled by her smiling pictures with President Putin in Rio - on the Ukrainian web.

Messages have pointed to the bloodshed in Ukraine which locals blame on Mr Putin fomenting unrest in their country.

Ukrainian military analyst Dmitry Tymchuk - who today said that alleged attacks from Russian territory amount to the start of 'war' - said Frau Merkel was being 'trolled' as a new von Ribbontrop because Berlin 'acts as an inactive and passive participant of the bloody show'.

He questioned whether she was seeking a retirement deal working for Gazprom

'The two world leaders appeared to be enjoying each other's company, chatting and laughing together during the match,' said the Kyiv Post today.

'At the same time, Ukrainian soldiers were fighting and dying while trying to defend the nation against Kremlin-backed separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.'

And Slava Rozhenko wrote: 'Danke, Frau Merkel-Ribbentropp! Poland 1939 - Ukraine 2014. Heil Putin!'.

The attack on the German leader came as the EU was on Wednesday deciding whether to impose new sanctions on Moscow. 

It came as Kiev warned of a new build-up of Kremlin troops on its borders and making fresh claims that Moscow is striking targets in Ukraine from inside Russia, tantamount to the start of war.

The allegations come as the EU and US decide on new sanctions, accusing  Putin of ignoring demands to reduce tension and instead stoking unrest on his neighbour's territory.

Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council Deputy Secretary Mykhaylo Koval has issued a blunt warning of a renewed threat of invasion from swelling troop numbers.

'Ukraine, like never before, stands on the cusp of a wide-scale aggression from our current northern border,' said the ex-defence minister, claiming a troop build up extends from north-central region of Chernigiv to the southeastern edge of the Russian-Ukrainian border on the Sea of Azov.

Officials have spoken of 'photo and video evidence' of Russia covertly supplying the fighters with weapons and armoured vehicles.

Ukrainian military analyst Dmytro Tymchuk warned today that strikes from Russian territory into Ukraine - causing casualties - represent a major new escalation.

'I don't know why we are so stubbornly ashamed to call a spade a spade and officially state that there is a war by Russia against Ukraine,' he said.

He insisted that an air strike on the town of Snizhne - killing 11 civilians - as well as a hit that downed a Ukrainian An-26 transport plane could only have been made by the Russian military as opposed to either rebel fighters or Kiev's armed forces.

'Until we call black, black, and the war a war, the theatre of the absurd will continue,' he said.

'In Russian cities, local authorities are openly holding send-off ceremonies for 'volunteers; as well as those openly recruited by military commissariats, for good money, to the war in Ukraine.

EU leaders meet on Wednesday to discuss sanctions with one source saying it was 'looking very possible' that the European Union at its summit in Brussels would agree to a new round of sanctions.

However, with Washington fearing the EU is dragging its feet due to close economic ties with Moscow, the US may go it alone on tougher measures against Moscow.
