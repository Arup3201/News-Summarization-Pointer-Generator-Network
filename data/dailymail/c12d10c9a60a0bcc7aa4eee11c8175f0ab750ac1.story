An online fundraising page for a three-year-old girl who was allegedly kicked out of a Mississippi KFC because of her facial scars has been removed amid doubts over her family's claims.

The GoFundMe page, which had raised more than $135,000 towards Victoria Wilcher's care, was removed on Tuesday after an investigation found no evidence that the girl's family had been to fast-food restaurant as they had claimed.

'In lieu of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the 'Victoria's Victories' online fundraising effort, GoFundMe has temporarily suspended the campaign until the full truth is made clear,' GoFundMe CEO Brad Damphousse said in a statement.

Hoax? Victoria Wilcher's grandmother claimed they had been asked to leave a KFC because of the girl's facial scars - but amid doubts the story is true, online fundraising for the girl has been suspended

Shut down: When you visit Victoria Wilcher's fundraising page, it no longer exists

Damphousse said a hold has been placed on the account balance in the meantime and that donors can request a refund via the website if they so wish, ABC News reported.

A Facebook page, 'Victoria’s Victories', that was set up for the little girl has also been removed.

The page had claimed that the three-year-old girl, who had lost an eye and suffered facial scars after she was attacked by her grandfather's pit bull in April, had been asked to leave a KFC.

The grandmother previously told WAPT that she ‘ordered a sweet tea and mashed potatoes and gravy’ at the restaurant before they were asked to leave because her scars were making other customers feel uncomfortable.

After posting the claims on the Facebook
 page, KFC immediately apologized and pledged to donate $30,000 towards 
the little girl's medical bills. KFC has said it intends to honor its 
commitment despite the findings of the investigations.

Two different investigations failed to find any evidence that an employee asked the girl and her grandmother to leave.

who claimed they had been asked to leave, didn't even visit the 
restaurant that day

Hannon 
Food Services, which operates the KFC restaurant, also issued a 
statement in which said it said it was deeply troubled by the 
allegation.

As
 part of its investigation, Hannon said it spent hundreds of hours 
reviewing surveillance video, interviewing employees and hired the 
outside investigator. The company said it would reach out to the child's
 family for additional discussions.

An unnamed source involved in the investigation told the Laurel Leader-Call that all the evidence in the case suggests the story told by Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, on May 15 was a hoax.

After 
reviewing surveillance tape from the Woodrow Wilson Drive branch – and 
another in Jackson - investigators found that the woman and the little 
girl didn't even visit the restaurant that day. 

A
 review of transactions on May 15 at both Jackson locations found the 
items the grandmother had claimed to have bought weren’t included in the
 same order at any point.

And no one
 matching the description of Mullins or Victoria visited either 
restaurant, the Leader-Call reported. 'It just didn’t happen,' the 
source told the newspaper.

KFC
 spokesman Rick Maynard said on Tuesday the company considered the 
matter closed after an internal investigation by the franchise 
restaurant in Jackson, Mississippi, and an independent probe.

Attack: Victoria is pictured left before the 
attack in April. Right, she is pictured the hospital six hours after her
 grandfather's dogs attacked her - claiming her right eye in the 
incident and causing facial paralysis

Getting better: She is expected to undergo several more surgeries in the future as she heals from the attack

‘Like the 
rest of America, the KFC family has been moved by the story of 
Victoria's injuries and recovery,’ Maynard said. ‘We hope everyone keeps
 Victoria in their thoughts and prayers. She will certainly be in ours.’

According
 to a statement issued on Tuesday by the family’s attorney Bill Kellum, 
Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, stands by her claim of what 
happened at the restaurant.

'Victoria's
 family appreciates the actions of KFC in their investigation of this 
matter. They look forward to assisting KFC in what we hope will be an 
ongoing investigation,' he said.

'It is deeply disappointing that other parties have taken opportunity to attack Victoria through social and news media outlets. Victoria is an innocent child with very real physical and emotional scars.

'The focus
 of her family has always been, and will always be on Victoria and 
making her whole again,' Kellum said. He said the child's family is 
grateful for outpouring of concern for her.

The
 family-maintained Facebook page also issued a statement on Tuesday 
denying that the whole thing was hoax, although just hours later the 
page was taken down.

Denial: In a statement posted on Facebook on Tuesday, the family denied they had made up the story and said the investigation was ongoing

'I promise its not a hoax, I never 
thought any of this would blow up the way it has. ... Please do not 
believe untrue media. I have personally watched this family go without 
to provide for Victoria. They have not and would not do anything to hurt
 Victoria in any way,' read the statement.

Victoria had been injured in April when three of her grandfather's pit 
bull dogs ran into his home in Simpson County by ripping through the back door of the home before jumping on her.

She was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and 
bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eyesockets, a broken nose, lost her
 right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face.

Her grandfather was arrested on charges of child endangerment and their eight surviving pit bulls were seized by Animal 
Control officers.

It is unclear if Kelly Mullins will face criminal charges if found to have made up the incident.
