An eight-year-old boy was caught trying to smuggle a pet turtle through airport customs in his underwear.

The boy, named Congcong, and his grandmother were going through  security when his grandmother told him to let the turtle go as pets weren't allowed on their flight from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport.

Congcong was so enamored with the turtle, that he refused to let go of it, at the last minute secretly stuffing the reptile into his underwear, hoping he could smuggle it onto the plane.

But the plucky lad was busted when security officials noticed something moving in his underpants.

Baffled by the bulge, the airport staff asked the boy if we was hiding something, and Congcong became nervous, attempting to hide the turtle with his hands. 

According to an airport spokesman: 'She (the grandmother) had told him to leave the pet behind but he had disobeyed her and tried to smuggle it on board the plane.

Security officials at Guangzhou International Airport became suspicious when they saw a moving bulge

In September 2004 Sydney officials seized a stuffed Texan-styled armadillo completed with armadillo-sized hat and holsters. 

Dutch custom officials at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport confiscated 200 poisonous tarantulas hidden in a couple’s suitcase in 2012.

In 2004, a man was stopped by Boston's Logan International Airport security when it was discovered he had the severed head of a seal in his hand luggage.  

'When the customs officials noticed he was trying to hide something, he tried to cover it up, and when his grandma asked him what he was hiding he tried to cover it up even more.' 

After inspecting his underpants, security staff found the frightened turtle nestled inside, moving its head from side-to-side, the Guangzhou Daily reports.

The small, yellow reptile was removed from the boy, who was also checked as he had a red patch of skin where the turtle had been hiding. 

Both boy and turtle were found to be in good health. 

And luckily for Congcong, airport officials agreed to let the animal travel in the cargo area and be delivered to his parents.

It's not the first time the airport has busted a passenger trying to sneak something scaly through security. 

Last year, a man at Guangzhou International Airport was caught attempting to sneak his pet turtle through by disguising it as a KFC hamburger.
