This is one fashion trend that even Lady Gaga would be too chicken to wear. 

Two UK-based artists, Victor Ivanov and Lewis G, have created a gimp suit made entirely of raw chicken skins. 

The pair have now paraded their finished project called FLESH around the streets of London, including visits to famous landmarks in the capital like Trafalgar Square and Camden Lock.

Artist Lewis paraded around Camden Lock in a gimp suit made of raw chicken skins, he later took part in an aerobics video wearing the costume 

The bizarre street-art experiment is making a statement about our vanity-driven culture, which Victor predicts could end with the world ending and: 'everyone standing on the ashes taking selfies.' 

Afterwards, Lewis also filmed an 80s-style aerobics video wearing the chicken suit.  

In an interview with Art Map London, the artist described the difficulty involved in making an gimp suit out of raw chicken skin. 

He said: 'Originally I started using flesh at university, as more of a way to experiment with biodegradable matter. 

'It's a little crass because obviously it's a very direct approach to interpreting our environment but nonetheless something that I want to experience first hand.

The chicken suit was extremely unpleasant to make. Artist Victor Ivanov said: 'it was really quite a horrible experience because just the feeling of piercing the flesh, you know it's wrong' 

Lewis G also wore the raw chicken suit to one of the capital's most famous landmarks - Trafalgar Square - which attracts thousands of visitors every day 

'I envisaged using it like any other material but the reality is it doesn't work quite in the same way because it's flush, you can't help but respond emotionally yourself. 

'When I first did it, it was really quite a horrible experience because just the feeling of piercing the flesh, you know it's wrong and you imagine it being alive and you doing that.''

The idea first originated from a much smaller project, where Victor and Lewis made a teddy bear using the skins. 

From there, they decided to create a costume big enough for Lewis to roam the streets of London. 

As well as the live performance, the men have now created a line of products using the chicken skin print that includes flip flops, shower curtains, mugs, iPhone covers, and baby dummies. 

Big fans can even cover their whole home in chicken skin as there is also a range of chicken skin wallpaper, duvet covers and cushions. 

Anyone who wants to try involved in the project will also be able to print out a chicken skin print from the artists' website and pose up in a tourist location themselves for a photo, to try and make the picture go viral.
