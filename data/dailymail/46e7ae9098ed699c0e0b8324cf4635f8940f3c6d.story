As a statue of England’s first black footballer was unveiled at St George’s Park on Thursday, it brought into focus the strides on racial inequality that have been made in our game and also the steps that still need taking.

This 16ft bronze replica of Arthur Wharton stands like a lightning rod for current debates about representation at the place where new generations of football minds will come to develop.

One black player in the Football League in 1889. Two black managers in the Football League in 2014; Chris Powell at Huddersfield, Keith Curle at Carlisle. More than a century of radical change has left some statistics looking static.

Cyrille Regis and Brendon Batson were not aware of Wharton’s story when they were playing for West Bromwich Albion in the late 70s and early 80s, subjected to racist abuse from the terraces.

They did not know how he had come to Britain from Ghana, aged 19, set a world record for the 100-yard sprint and then begun playing as an amateur for Darlington.

They did not know he subsequently moved to Preston North End, then signed professional forms as a goalkeeper for Rotherham and Sheffield United in the top flight.

They do know, some 125 years later, that the landscape of modern coaching is imbalanced and are able to detail why the Rooney Rule is needed to provide equilibrium.

‘The unveiling of Arthur Wharton’s statue is a really good touchstone for the contribution black footballers have made,’ said Batson, who works with the Football Association on a consultancy basis. ‘All of us have experienced racism, we know what we had to put up with. I can only imagine what he had to put up with in those days.

‘The significance is that while it has got a lot better over the years, it is still there in more subtle forms. We know the integration of black players has been phenomenal but there are still issues around inclusion. There is a parallel when you see a lack of black managers.’

This subject is live. Football League chairman Greg Clarke faced calls to resign after failing to raise the issue at the governing body’s AGM last month, but has now launched a review into under-representation.

Replying to Jose Mourinho’s insistence there is ‘no racism in football’, Fifa vice-president Jeffrey Webb said racism was ‘overt’ in the English game and highlighted Chelsea youth coach Eddie Newton’s inability to get job interviews.

‘Sometimes people want to appoint in their own image,’ said Batson. ‘But how do you know you’re getting the best candidate if you don’t widen your scope?’

The solution, as Batson, Regis and many others observe, can be found across the Atlantic. Named after Dan Rooney, who implemented the legislation in America’s NFL, the Rooney Rule would mean at least one candidate from a black and minority ethnic (BME) background is interviewed for each major football role that becomes available at a club – from manager to first-team coach to academy head.

It is not, despite some beliefs, a quota designed to give an unfair leg-up. It is a mechanism intended to ensure qualified individuals are given a chance to pitch themselves in front of a selection panel or chief executive.

Paul Davis, who won seven major honours during a 17-year career at Arsenal, was a coach at the club between 1996 and 2003. But he left after failing to progress from his role overseeing the Under-13s despite gaining qualifications and guiding through the likes of Ashley Cole, David Bentley and Fabrice Muamba.

He joined the PFA the following year and obtained his UEFA Pro Licence in 2006, the highest grade attainable. In his role as coach educator he talks to players about pathways in the game and leads courses up to UEFA B badge standard.

'During my seven years coaching, more senior positions did become vacant at the club but although I was ambitious and dedicated to developing my career in coaching, I was never offered the chance to apply and so further opportunities never materialised for me,’ said Davis. 'There was no process, somebody was all of a sudden in another position. It was really frustrating. I was overlooked three times.

‘Unqualified people were allowed to leapfrog. I did speak to David Dein, who tried to get the final decision altered, but I was very disillusioned and took myself out of the picture. I had a lot to offer.

'There is a lot of frustration among players. I feel it when I speak to them at training grounds and a lot of this stems from bad practice and unfairness with regard to recruitment of coaches at clubs, even in cases where a player has played for a number of years and has the qualifications. There is also a general feeling amongst players that there is the perception black players aren’t interested in becoming managers and coaches. That is not the case. Once people realise that the situation may change.'

The point here is that we will never see more black managers if opportunities in their early careers are checked. Around 25 per cent of professional footballers are non-white, but that figure translates to little more than two per cent in management.

Broaden that to the six big football jobs at clubs – 552 in English football – and almost three per cent (16) are performed by an individual of BME background. Ugo Ehiogu, under-21s coach at Tottenham, is one.

Statistics show there is an eagerness to gain coaching qualifications. Last year 45 of 238 people on PFA courses were black (19 per cent). Batson believes those numbers will grow when a clear route is mapped out. 

‘You don’t invest in yourself when you think you have no chance,’ he said.

When Batson and Regis played alongside Laurie Cunningham, it was viewed as a bold move by West Brom to have three black players in the same team. It is quite remarkable to think that if a club, nearly 40 years later, were to appoint a black manager, black assistant and black first-team coach the response could be similar.

Regis calls Wharton’s statue an ‘inspiration’ for all, no matter of colour. ‘It’ s a universal message about following your dream and having character.’

He did just that and can recall the climate in his playing days, tracing it to the modern game. 

‘Managers had prejudices about black players handling the cold weather, being fancy dans, or too laid back, all those misconceptions,’ Regis said. ‘We got over that.

‘Now there seems to be misconceptions about black managers. You have to ask other people about why that is. We need to get answers from the people who make decisions.’
