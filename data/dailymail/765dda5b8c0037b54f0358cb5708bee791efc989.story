Huge hailstones battered a remote village on a Scottish island with such force they smashed through a car windscreen.

Chunks of ice the size of pound coins rained down on the the village of Ness on the Isle of Lewis in a freak winter storm last night.

The back screen of a car window was broken as the hail fell and thunder and lighting rumbled across the island. 

Chunks of ice the size of pound coins rained down on the the village of Ness on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, last night

The biggest hailstone recorded in Britain weighed 141g and fell in Horsham, West Sussex on September 5, 1958.

And in June 1968, a tennis ball sized stone fell at Cardiff Airport. 

But the heaviest hailstones on record (according to Guinness World Records) were the size of grapefruits. They weighed up to 1kg and fell in the Gopalganj district of Bangladesh on April 14, 1986. They reportedly killed 92 people.

Unusually large hailstones form in thunderstorms, mainly during the summer - and can be large enough to dent cars, injure, and even kill people. 

Local crofter Donald MacSween, who posted images of the damage on Twitter, said: 'It happened at the back of 11 last night.

'There was loud thunder less than a mile away. Then there were these marble-sized hailstones.

'I've never seen them that big before in real life.'

Mr MacSween said he looked out the window and some of his sheep were 'going bananas'.

'It [the hailstones] only lasted about a minute,' he added.

Kay Gunn, postmistress at the Port of Ness Post Office, said: 'I'd never heard anything like it in all my life.'

She continued: 'The wind picked up. We heard a rumble and at first we thought it was a lorry.

'There was a big flash and another rumble and then the hailstones started.'
