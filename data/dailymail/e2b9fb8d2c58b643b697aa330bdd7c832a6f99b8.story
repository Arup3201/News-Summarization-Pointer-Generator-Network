Eden Hazard has warned Tottenham that Chelsea are desperate for revenge after they were humiliated 5-3 at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day.

Jose Mourinho's side advanced to the Capital One Cup final on Tuesday night after seeing off Liverpool, and could face either Spurs or Sheffield United at Wembley. 

Belgian midfielder Hazard admitted that while he is happy to face either team in the final, a clash with Mauricio Pochettino's men offered the opportunity for revenge.

'Yes, to get revenge (for the 5-3) - it'd be good. We have to,' Hazard told London24.

'But it doesn't matter if it's Tottenham or the other one, we have to win the final.

'When you play for Chelsea, every defeat is difficult. You have to give more to clean the situation.

'It wasn't the best game against Liverpool, but we are in the final.

'We have a very good mentality. Even if we lose, we know we can get another result. It's always good.'
