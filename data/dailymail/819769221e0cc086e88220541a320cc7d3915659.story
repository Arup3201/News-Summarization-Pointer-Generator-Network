A black man has been accused of being an illegal cab driver after city investigators spotted him dropping of his white wife to work, their lawsuit has revealed.

Dan Keys Jr., 66, and his wife Symone Palermo, 53, have accused the Taxi and Limousine Commission of racially profiling them and serving them with false summonses - even though they repeatedly insisted they were husband and wife. They are suing the TLC for $3 million.

Mr Keys, a car salesman, was driving his wife's black Town Car to take her to work in Flushing Queens last year. She sat in the backseat because rain had made the front passenger seat wet the night before, their lawsuit said.

After 
dropping her off at her job at Bob's Discount Furniture, Mr Keys was 
pulled over by investigators and accused of using his black Town Car as 
an illegal cab, the lawsuit claimed.

They had mistaken Palermo, who is actually biracial, as being white and assumed she was a customer, the suit claimed, DNAinfo reported.

'Upon information and belief, when attempting to identify illegally operated taxis, it is the official policy or custom of [the city and the TLC] to instruct its employees to target and single out vehicles operated by minorities with white passengers,' the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit claims that investigators lied and claimed that a 'white female' passenger had told them that he was indeed an unlicensed driver.

Even when Palermo joined them in an attempt to clear up the misunderstanding, the investigators refused to believe them and they were served with summonses with false allegations, the suit said.

'Once they pulled over my clients, [the investigators] had many opportunities to let them go - to realize they pulled over the wrong people,' the couple's lawyer, David Haber, told DNAinfo.

'Instead they doubled down on their mistake. I believe that they flat-out lied in their summonses.'

A city administrative judge ruled in the couple's favor and dismissed the summonses - but investigators kept hold of the couple's car for a week until the case was over.

The TLC would not discuss the suit.
