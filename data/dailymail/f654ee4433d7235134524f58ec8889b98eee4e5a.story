A man has died in a blaze at a flat while firemen were on strike in a dispute over pensions.

Stand-in crews, staffed with privately-contracted replacements, were called to the blaze at the ground-floor flat in  north London where they discovered the man’s body inside.

The fire broke out on Saturday night as members of the Fire  Brigades Union in England and Wales were on their sixth walk-out over changes to their pensions.

Flashpoint: Firemen at a protest over planned changes to their pensions as a man died on Saturday

A man was killed in a fire at a flat in Oakfield Road, Hornsey, north London last night while members of the Fire Brigades Union were on strike in a row over pensions

Union members were on a four-hour 
strike over plans to change the retirement age for firefighters from 55 
to 60. Staff are also in dispute over how much they contribute to their 
pensions.

However, the London Fire Brigade said the industrial action 
had not impacted on the way the fire was dealt with.

‘Based
on early investigations into this death, it is not believed that the 
strike made any difference to the outcome,’ the spokesman said.

‘It
does not appear that neither the contingency fire crews, nor LFB’s own 
crews had they not been on strike, would have reached him in time and 
have successfully rescued him.’

The
spokesman said crews were called out to the blaze in Hornsey just 
before 10pm. ‘The fire damaged part of the ground-floor flat and sadly 
the body of a man was found at the scene,’ he added.

‘The Brigade was 
called at 2152 and the incident was over by 2314.

‘The cause of the fire is under investigation.’

The
FBU’s London branch wrote on Twitter before the incident: ‘Firefighters preparing for their sixth strike in dispute over pensions,
to take place tonight between 6.00pm and 10.00pm.’

It later tweeted: 
‘Information coming in which suggests the London Fire Brigade’s 
contingency plans failed disastrously tonight.’

During
the strike the brigade stationed 27 fire engines, staffed with 
privately contracted contingency crews, at locations across London to 
deal with emergencies.

While
the action was taking place 88 emergency calls were received by the 
control room and crews were sent to 14 incidents, including six dwelling
fires, two building fires, two calls to help people trapped in lifts 
and four false alarms.

The 
death was the first fatality during the current series of national 
walkouts by the FBU. The man had not been named last night.

The
only previous major incident during the dispute was a fire at a scrap 
yard in Dagenham, which happened during a four-hour strike on November 
1.

London Fire Brigade asked for crews to be recalled to tackle the incident but the FBU refused the request.

The
current strikes are the first national industrial action by the FBU 
since an eight-week strike in 2002 when Army ‘green goddess’ fire 
engines were deployed as cover.
