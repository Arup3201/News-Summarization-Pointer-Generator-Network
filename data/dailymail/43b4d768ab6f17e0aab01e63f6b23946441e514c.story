Martin Olsson lost his head, while Dave Edwards used his as Wolves suggested this season in the Championship will be happier than their last.

Sweden defender Olsson was sent off for a second bookable offence after pulling down Rajiv van La Parra and then pushed referee Simon Hooper in the chest as he raised the red card.

It could mean an extended ban for the left back, who kicked a water bottle as he stormed down the tunnel to complete a hat-trick of stupid moves.

Booked: Hoolahan 54, Garrido 82, Martin 90+1 

Red card: Olsson 60

Four minutes after his dismissal Wolves scored the only goal of the game as Van La Parra sent over a cross from the space vacated by Olsson and Edwards rose higher than Russell Martin to nod into the far corner beyond John Ruddy.

The last match Wolves had at this level was a watershed 2-0 loss to Brighton that confirmed a second successive drop and sparked angry scenes between fans and players.

Manager Kenny Jackett detoxified the atmosphere by casting aside the expensive flops and installing a hungry, young team and yesterday entrusted the same group to make the step up. Van La Parra was the only debutant in Jackett’s selection and he already looks like a bargain find.

Signed free from Heerenveen, the 23-year-old winger troubled Norwich time and again with his pace and delivery and he easily outstripped Olsson as the pair raced for a long ball in the 60th minute, provoking the defender’s desperate action when he angled his run towards the area. Olsson had already been booked for mistiming a sliding tackle on Nouha Dicko in the first half.

Soon after Van La Parra showed his crossing ability with a ball that met Edwards’ dart from deep perfectly, sending Molineux delirious.

Norwich had been in the ascendancy at that stage, with Andrew Surman and Lewis Grabban going close, but with 10 men they were always chasing and Wolves could have extended their lead. 

Had Dicko been smarter on a breakaway Bakary Sako would have had a simple finish but the pass was slow and Ruddy made the stop.

Norwich boss Neil Adams said he did not see Olsson put his hands on the referee but did question his defending for the foul. 

‘You think could he have made a better decision to avoid getting into that situation,’ he said.

For Jackett, it was an 11th game without defeat. ‘To get a win on the first day is a big thing for us coming into a new division,’ he said. ‘It was an excellent goal that won the game, a late run and a very, very good header into the corner.’

Meanwhile, Norwich confirmed on Sunday night they are investigating allegations of racist abuse coming from their own fans at Wolves.
