Abu Wa'el Dhiab, pictured, claims the process of force feeding him is abusive 

The White House wants a court hearing into a Guantanamo Bay prisoner held without trial since August 2002 held in secret. 

Abu Wa'el Dhiab, from Syria, has been on hunger strike and claims that attempts by medics to force feed him are abusive. 

However, the Obama administration claims that much of the information about Dhiab is highly classified and cannot be discussed in open court. 

The Justice Department claims that 'an open hearing risks unauthorized disclosure of classified or protected information. The record in this case is large, with classified and protected information often inextricably intertwined with unclassified information'.

Dhiab's legal team claims that their client has to be forcibly removed from his cell by guards, and strapped to a chair where the force feeding is carried out. 

The Defense Department counters that they only force feed patients against their will to keep them alive. 

The hearing is due to take place on October 6 where three doctors will give evidence about the mental and physical impact of force feeding. 

Dhaib's lawyer Jon Eisenberg said they will present 32 video tapes showing the force feeding process. 

Eisenberg said: 'This hearing is going to be much like a full-blown trial. What the government is seeking to do is to keep all of it secret.'

The Justice Department said that any unclassified materiel would be released and a public version of the case transcripts would be published. 

The former Navy commander at Guantanamo Bay, Rear Admiral Richard Butler, said in a court declaration filed in July that even though the forced cell extraction videos are lawful, humane and appropriate, they 'are particularly susceptible to use as propaganda and to incite a public reaction because of their depiction of forcible ... guard interaction with detainees.'

The videos that also contain footage of forced-feedings could be used 'to foment anti-American sentiment and inflame Muslim sensitivities as it depicts ... personnel providing medical care to a detainee while he is restrained,' Butler said in the declaration.

Releasing a video showing a detainee receiving medical care while restrained 'would exacerbate the world's perception of detainees in U.S. custody,' Butler added. 'Public release, in whole or in part, of videos showing forced cell extractions' or feedings would cause 'serious damage to national security'.

Dhiab, 42, was categorised as being suitable for release and resettlement in 2009 and has not been charged with any offence. 

Hunger strikes at Guantanamo began shortly after the prison opened in 2002, with force-feeding starting in early 2006 following a mass hunger strike. A new strike began in February 2013, with more than 100 of 154 prisoners in custody participating at one point.

There are currently 149 prisoners at the detention center, and Crider has said the legal team believes roughly 34 are on hunger strike and some 18 meet the guidelines for feedings. 

Dhiab started his hunger strike 18 months ago as a protest against his indefinite detention at Guantanamo Bay.

In July, the Pentagon agreed to transfer Dhiab and five other prisoners to Uruguay, which has agreed to give them asylum. 

The men are unable to return to their own homes because of the threat to their lives. 

Dhiab was arrested in Pakistan, where he claims he was a honey salesman. 

His legal team said he has been forcibly extracted from his cell almost 50 times this year. 

However, camp officials claim that Dhiab has been abusive to guards, threatening to kill or seriously injure them. 

He said since April he has tried to assault troops three times and twice used vomit and faeces as weapons.
