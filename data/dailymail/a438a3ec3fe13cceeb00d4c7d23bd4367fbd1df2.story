A cash-strapped couple are hoping to fund their lavish wedding by auctioning off places at the ceremony to random strangers.

Patsy O'Connor, 39, and fiancée Radina Hadshieva, 28, who live in Sofia, Bulgaria, plan to tie the knot in an extravagant Las Vegas on March 16, the day before St Patrick's Day.

But when the potential cost spiralled to just less than £12,000, they quickly devised a way to grab some extra income.

The pair are now auctioning off six seats to their nuptials, which will see winning bidders attend the ceremony and the reception, complete with free bar.

After dancing the night away the strangers will then be free to join the happy couple and their other guests at the following morning's celebrations.

Patsy has opened up the bidding at $300 (£198), which will rise in increments of $50 (£33) per bid.

The fun-loving Irishman, who runs a web design business, said: 'Funding weddings is always an issue and there are a lot of websites where guests and friends can donate to help.

'I'm always coming up with different and wacky ideas. This just popped into my head one morning.

'Radina was the first person I spoke to, she thought the idea was excellent and said, "Go ahead and do it". 

'She doesn't mind if there's random strangers at our wedding.

'The only twist is the strangers have to bid for the chance to come.

'The other guests love the idea. I don't think they really care at all, if they are any random strangers. They are quite fun and outgoing people and they think the idea is brilliant. They said to definitely go for something big and wacky.'

Patsy, of Cork, Ireland, and Bulgarian Radina met through friends three years ago but only became a couple eight months ago.

The pair who live in Sofia, Bulgaria, began planning their wedding in Las Vegas after attending a friend's do in the same place.

'A Vegas wedding is a once in a lifetime experience I totally recommend,' Patsy added.

'If anyone had told me a year later I would be in Vegas for my own wedding, I wouldn't have believed them.'

One morning, as the pair started planning their wedding, Patsy woke up with the idea to auction off seats to his wedding.

He woke his future wife and excitedly told her the plan. Incredibly, she agreed.

Patsy has now created a website where strangers can log on and bid, in an attempt to join the celebrations.

The couple are set to wed on March 16 2015, before celebrating St Patrick's Day in Fremont Street in downtown Vegas with the entire wedding party the day after.

Guests will have to make their own way to the American gambling capital however, and arrange their own accomodation.

Patsy said: 'We will pick them up at a Las Vegas central location and they get transport to the wedding and back, with an open bar.

'They'll get the ceremony, the reception and the St Patrick's Day celebration the day after.

'Radina is Bulgarian and she is not your traditional woman, she wouldn't be agreeing to this otherwise, she is a little bit mad. We're a pretty good match.'

Patsy is also hoping to tempt businesses into funding limo hire, hotel and flight expenses, a honeymoon in Disneyland and even a budget for gambling in Vegas' casinos.
