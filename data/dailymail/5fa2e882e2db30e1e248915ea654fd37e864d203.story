Traditionally the perfect mirror can tell you if you are the fairest of them all - the the real-life version is likely to give you a less than fairytale answer.

Panasonic has unveiled its virtual Mmirror, which it hopes could soon be in department stores around the world.

It can analyse your face using built in high definition cameras, and point out every flaw - and tell you which products can fix them.

The 'bearded lady' look: The Panasonic virtual mirror lets people try on different makeup - and facial hair

'This is not a gimmick, it's a serious technology solution,' said Julie Bauer, president of Panasonic's consumer electronics for North America, as she revealed the mirror at the CES show in Las Vegas. 

'After analysing your skin condition and pointing out fine lines, age spots and other issues it recommends cosmetics and treatments,' she said.

'It also lets you virtually try on different makeups for different looks.'

Bauer also hit back at claims the mirror was simply a gimmick. 

'It is not a gimmick, it allows retailers to meet a need that can be used by retailers to engage their customers.

'It also has potential for the clinical and education market.'

There are a range of different styles from decorative and playful to colourful and you can play around with eyebrow shape, eyeshadow, cheek colour and lipstick.

The demonstration of the technology at Panasonic's booth at the show also had one added feature - allowing people to 'try on' facial hair.

However, it is unlikely to be appearing in your bathroom soon - Panasonic specifically said the mirror as being placed in department stores to sell products to consumers.
