Scotland's top civil servant has been accused of warning businesses to 'keep out' of the independence campaign.

Sir Peter Housden is said to have urged companies not to get involved in the debate like a 'school bully', after warnings about threats to the economy if Scotland goes it alone.

The row is the latest allegation of intimidation against opponents of Alex Salmond's dream of independence, with just two days until the historic referendum.

Sir Peter Housden, permanent secretary for the Scottish Government, is accused of telling companies to 'keep out' of the independence debate

First Minister Alex Salmond had accused Downing Street of orchestrating a 'scaremongering' campaign by getting firms to speak out against independence

Mr Salmond has repeatedly accused the UK government and David Cameron of orchestrating 'scaremongering' stories from business leaders about the impact of independence.

It followed warnings from banks, retailers, mobile phone companies and oil firms about the risk of prices rises and operations being moved south of the border.

Sir Jeremy Heywood, the most senior civil servant in Downing Street, was accused of urging companies to speak out, which Number 10 denied.

However, the Daily Telegraph today reported allegations that Sir Peter had told companies not to get involved in the campaign.

In one case he was said to have called a business person and warned that it was 'inappropriate' to get involved, the newspaper said.

A second person said Sir Peter had 'torn strips' off him after he raised questions about independence.

Another director of a Scottish company claimed to have had calls from both Sir Peter, and Scottish finance minister John Swinney.

The executive said: 'The conversations were always very clever and it was as though they were trying to trick me into saying something. They were saying, 'Keep out of it.'

The Yes campaign has been bombarded with warnings from banks, retailers, mobile phone companies and oil firms about the risk of prices rises and operations being moved south of the border

It was claimed Sir Peter behaved like 'school bully' by trying to 'rebuke' firms about their concerns.

However a spokesman for the Scottish government said 'public bodies funded by the taxpayer were properly reminded of their responsibility to remain neutral claims regarding [Sir Peter Housden] approaching other [non-public body] organisations are not true.'

A spokesman for the Scottish National Party added: 'There has been plotting at senior levels of the UK Government to spread scare stories in the run-up to the referendum. 

'We entirely reject these unsubstantiated accusations about individuals associated with the SNP and the Yes campaign, which appear to be an attempt to divert attention from Downing Street's campaign of bullying. 

'We welcome and encourage all voices and views to the debate on Scotland's future – and no one can seriously claim that this debate is anything other than open, with many high-profile contributions from all sides.'

Mr Salmond yesterday claimed the Mr Cameron's 'fingerprints are all over a scaremongering' campaign being orchestrated by Unionists.

David Cameron used a speech last night to insist: 'To warn of the consequences is not to scare-monger'

Dozens of major firms including BP, Asda, John Lewis, Vodafone, RBS, Lloyds and B&Q have issued warnings that independence could hit jobs and investment and put up prices.

But Mr Salmond insisted the interventions by banks, telecoms companies, retailers and oil giants were being co-ordinated by Downing Street to frighten voters.

Speaking during a pro-business event at Edinburgh airport, Mr Salmond said: 'When you try to pressurise people, pressurise companies, as the Prime Minister has undoubtedly been doing and indeed the Treasury, then that's a different circumstance.

'I think people in Scotland will know the Prime Minister's fingerprints are all over the scaremongering campaign and the Treasury's fingerprints are all over the bank campaign.'

But Mr Cameron hit back in a speech in Aberdeen last night: 'To warn of the consequences is not to scare-monger.

'It is like warning a friend about a decision they might take that will affect the rest of their lives – and the lives of their children.

'I say all this because I don't want the people of Scotland to be sold a dream that disappears.'
