Seren Bundy-Davies continued her remarkable rise by winning a 400metres bronze medal in 52.64sec at the European Indoor Championships in Prague. 

The 20-year-old biomedical science student had not broken 54sec until May last year.

But she has been running so well this year — coming into her first senior major championships as the fastest in Europe — that missing out on gold was a blow.

‘I realise it’s a massive achievement but I did come into it wanting to win it,’ she said, ‘I know how hard I’ve worked and I think maybe I should have just got to the bell first.’

Bundy-Davies, who studies part-time at the University of Manchester, was controversially beaten by drugs cheat Nataliya Pyhyda, who has served a two-year ban for taking anabolic steroid stanozolol.

There was good news for Jenny Meadows, whose luck may be finally turning, it seems. Meadows, 33, is through to Sunday's 800m final after Russian Anastasiya Bazdyreva was disqualified for running outside the track.

Meadows finished fourth in her semi-final but has been suffering from a bad cold all week and is not hopeful of getting a medal in the final. ‘I think I just need to go to bed,’ she said.

Lee Emanuel took silver in the 3,000m behind Ali Kaya, who some argued should not be competing at the championships. 

Emanuel ran a personal best of 7min 44.48sec and was a long way behind Kaya, who was born and lives in Kenya but was representing Turkey.

Meanwhile British pair Richard Kilty and Chijindu Ujah teed up a mouthwatering clash in Sunday's 60m final.

Both sprinters each won their heat in identical times of 6.57sec.
