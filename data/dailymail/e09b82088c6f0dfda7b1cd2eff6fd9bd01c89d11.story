Before Robin Williams took his own life last week, the Oscar-winning actor recorded a video message of hope, support and ‘love’ to a woman in a hospice with a terminal illness.

When 21-year-old Vivian Waller was diagnosed in January with lung, bowel and liver cancer, she included a meeting with Williams on a ‘bucket list’ of the things she hoped to achieve before  she died.

Her condition deteriorated and she was too sick to travel from her native Auckland, New Zealand, to America, so one of her friends contacted the  63-year-old comedian and he agreed to record a short video clip which he emailed to the family a few months ago.

Shortly before he died, Robin Williams recorded a video message of hope, support and 'love' for a
 woman in New Zealand who is in a hospice with a terminal illness

The Oscar-winning actor, who was found dead on Monday, recorded the video so 
Vivian Waller, 21, could cross a meeting with the star off her 'bucket 
list' of things she wanted to achieve before she died

‘Hi Vivian . . . it’s Robin Williams here saying, “Hey girl, what’s going on down there in New Zealand?”,’ Williams says in the message.

‘I’m sending all my love  to you . . . knock this off your bucket list.’

Williams (pictured blowing Vivian a kiss) then broke into brief song, explaining that he’s ‘channelling Matthew McConaughey’ [the dashing actor] before signing off with — ‘much love to you, baby’.

Vivian’s husband, Jack, whom she married in February, says she was thrilled beyond belief with Williams’s message.

He has, though, yet to discuss the actor’s suicide with her, because it’s too sensitive a subject. 

‘We are just enjoying the time we have together,’ he says. ‘We take things a day at a time.’

In the video, the comedian - who puts on a trademark accent - says: 'Hi Vivian, it's Robin Williams here saying "Hey girl, what's going on down there in New Zealand?"'

Jack told stuff.co.nz that he decided to open up about the message from Williams because 'we love him, we want to show people how awesome a person he was'.

The pair married in February after fundraisers from around New Zealand donated enough money in just 10 days to pay for their wedding. They are now fundraising for their daughter's future.

Their daughter Sophie celebrated her first birthday a few months later.

Williams, 63, was found dead at his San Francisco mansion on Monday. Authorities said his death was suicide.

His death came after years of battling depression and anxiety, as well as an
 addiction to cocaine and alcohol.

In a statement after his death, Williams' wife, Susan Schneider, said the beloved comedy actor was also battling the early stages of Parkinson's disease when he took his life.

According to the widow, Williams wasn't ready to share the diagnosis with the world. She added that his 'sobriety was intact' at the time of his death.

Since the actor's death, a number of people have come forward with inspiring stories about how he touched their lives.

Mark Cole told how Robin Williams once chartered a private plane to pay a surprise visit to meet his terminally-ill daughter Jessica after she became too sick to visit him on set.

She had been a huge fan of Mrs Doubtfire - one of his most popular roles - and had requested to meet him through the Make-A-Wish foundation.

Garry Kravit, whose nephew David Buist was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, also called the star a 'comedic Mother Theresa'.

Mr Kravit told how he met Robin Williams at an event and asked him for autographed items for their fundraising efforts.

Williams went much further and started calling David to help keep his spirits up as his condition deteriorated.

Mr Kravit said: 'When David was suffering at his worst, Robin would call him to perk him up. David treasured Robin's calls and it helped to push him forward.'

He also told how Williams even invited the pair to a filming of a comedy special in New York in 2004, where 'he spent 20 minutes hugging him'.
