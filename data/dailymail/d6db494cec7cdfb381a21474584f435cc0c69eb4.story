A crew member on a Carnival cruise ship has gone missing and there are concerns the individual may have fallen overboard.

Despite initial reports that the missing member was Australian, Carnival Cruise Liners have not released the nationality of the person is, but said that he is not an Australian national.

David Jones, spokesman for Carnival Crusies told the Daily Mail Australia 'We've expressed deep concern for the welfare of a crew member on Carnival spirit. The crew member didn't report to his normal work station this morning.'

Desperate search: The Carnival Spirit has turned around to search for missing Australian crew member.

'That promoted an extensive search of the Carnival Spirit,' Mr Jones said, adding that the search did not locate the crew member.

Earlier on Tuesday, it was decided that the Carnival would retrace her course in the hope of locating the crew member and search and rescue authorities in the area had been notified and were assisting.

Mr Jone also said the 'ship will remain in the ship pattern until officially released by the search and rescue.'

The 2500 passenger ship left Vanuatu yesterday on a 12-night Pacific Islands cruise and was scheduled for a sea day today between Vanuatu and Fiji.

This comes just over 12 months since an Australian couple went missing while aboard the same ship.

Kristen Schroder and Paul Rossington from Barraba near Tamworth jumped form the balcony of the cruise liner in May 2013.

The young couple were found to missing when they didn't collect their luggage, and CCTV footage reportedly showing the pair going overboard on the morning of May 8.
