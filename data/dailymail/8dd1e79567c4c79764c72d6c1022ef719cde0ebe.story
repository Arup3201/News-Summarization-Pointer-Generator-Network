Protective: A sign of a figure pointing a gun has been erected outside the school in a bid to deter shootings

A group of Arkansas teachers will carry firearms when the school term resumes this September, in an attempt to deter gunmen who target schools.

The decision to train and arm staff at Arkansas Christian Academy was made public when a new safety sign was posted in front of the school.

It reads: 'Staff is armed and trained. Any attempt to harm children will be met with deadly force.'

According to ArkansasMatters staff from the private school in Bryant have been trained in firearm safety and will carry guns during the school day.

The
 school's controversial policy comes just weeks after Attorney General 
Dustin McDaniel rejected plans to arm staff in Arkansas' public schools.

He said a state board doesn't have the authority to allow districts to employ their teachers and staff as security guards.

However, legislation does allow private schools run by a church to arm its staff.

The
 idea has been debated across the country in the wake of the school 
shooting in Connecticut last December, when six teachers and 20 children
 were killed.

Pastor
 Perry Black told KARK-TV that he has armed security during his church 
service and is applying the practice to protect children.

He said: 'I just felt like with what's going on in many of the public sectors 
where there seems to be a lot of shootings we need to take the same 
stance that we do in church on Sunday for our kids Monday through 
Friday.'

'We have the same law enforcement officers that have helped us through 
training and helped us through our concealed carry permits'.

Pastor Black acknowledged that his decision went against the advice of the Attorney general.

He said: 'We certainly recognize his authority and his right to his opinion and 
we reserve our right as American citizens and as Christians to protect 
the children on our campus'.

Staff from Arkansas Christian Academy began training early this year.

Republican gubernatorial candidate Curtis Coleman showed his support for the school's policy.

He said he respected Pastor Black for his decision.
