Cyprus' football governing body has decided to call a replay of a title decider between AEL Limassol and APOEL Nicosia after it was abandoned last week when a firework hit a player.

The judicial committee of the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) decided in a majority vote on Thursday evening to call a replay of the game to be played on neutral ground and without spectators.

The referee stopped the highly-charged game in Limassol on May 17 after a firecracker hit APOEL defender Kaka on the head as he was sitting on the bench. The missile, thrown from AEL stands, pierced the plastic dugout.

Concern: APOEL defender Kaka is treated by paramedics after being hit in the head by a missile

Chaos: Kaka and a club doctor lie on the ground after the dugout was hit by a missile

Shocking: A hole in the dugout after Kaka was hit in the head by a 'pistol-fired missile'

The game was level at 0-0 when it was interrupted in the 51st minute.

AEL lead the table with 81 points, three ahead of APOEL who have a superior goal difference.

The committee said that awarding the game to APOEL would be 'disproportionate' towards AEL and unfair to APOEL, 
who would be deprived of their chance of clinching the title on the 
pitch.

APOEL said their lawyers were reviewing the decision, leaving the possibility for an appeal open.
