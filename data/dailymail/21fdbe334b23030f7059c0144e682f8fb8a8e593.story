Life lost: Elliott Earl Williams, 37, passed away in 2011 while in jail five days after he was arrested for causing a disturbance in an Oklahoma hotel during a mental breakdown

A shocking video that captured an inmate dying in an Oklahoma jail in October 2011 was released Monday as part of a lawsuit accusing the correctional facility of failing to provide the man with badly needed medical treatment.

Elliott Earl Williams, 37, passed away in his cell on October 27, 2011, five days after being arrested for causing a disturbance in a hotel.

According to the suit filed on behalf of his estate, Williams 'sat in a cell dying for five days without ever receiving the treatment and care he so desperately and obviously needed.'

The man was arrested in Owasso on October 21 after causing a scene at the TownePlace Suites by Marriott.

Police
officers who responded to the call found Williams in the lobby of the 
hotel having what appeared to be a mental breakdown. A police report 
stated that the 37-year-old was 'rambling about God' and 'eating dirt.’

Williams
was charged with a count of misdemeanor obstruction. According to the 
lawsuit, in the course of his brief stay at Owasso Police Headquarters, 
the mentally disturbed man was observed crawling on his hands and knees,
barking and repeatedly slamming his head into the wall.

Williams
was left in a holding cell for more than 10 hours, during which time he
defecated on himself. He was then placed in a shower 'feet first, on 
his back,' and the water was left running for up to two hours.

Beginning of the end: Williams was placed in a medical cell at the Tulsa County Jail on October 25, 2011

Bad treatment: A jail staffer was captured on video tossing trays of food into the man's cell

A short time later, the suspect was transferred to Tulsa County Jail. During the booking process, Williams allegedly complained about being unable to walk and begged police to 'cut it out of my belly,' the TV station KTUL reported.

After being examined by a psychiatrist, Williams was moved into a so-called 'suicide cell.' A video camera installed inside the room captured the man lying immobile on his back with just a blanket covering his naked body.

The 10-minute, 23-second footage released this week as part of the on-going litigation shows jailhouse staffers throwing trays of food into the cell.

Throughout his stay in the medical cell, Williams was visited by a number of officials, who are seen on surveillance video examining him from afar while carefully trying to avoid touching him.

Too little, too late: It was not until two days later that staffers noticed that something was wrong with the 37-year-old man

At one point, a man in a suit jacket could be seen lifting a corner of the blanket to cover Williams' genitals as he lies motionless and unresponsive.

The disturbing video shows Williams not moving beyond reaching for a cup of water, dipping his fingers in it and bringing them to his mouth. The packaged meals scattered around the room remained untouched.

Later in the recording, staffers walk into the cell and discover that Williams is in medical distress. Employees of Correctional Healthcare Management of Oklahoma Inc. then make several attempts to revive Williams by administering CPR, but to no avail.

Cause of death: A medical examiner determined that Williams died from spinal injuries caused by blunt force trauma

The state Medical Examiner's Office later determined that Williams died from spinal injuries caused by blunt force trauma, Tulsa World reported.

Following the release of the jail cell footage, the county's Board of Commissioners voted to seek requests for bids for health care services at the jail.

Correctional Healthcare Management of Oklahoma Inc. or its affiliates have been the penitentiary's medical care provider since July 2005. Last year alone, the company was paid $5.2million for its services. 

A county official, however, insisted that the decision to seek proposals from other health care providers was in no way related to the lawsuit over Williams' death.
