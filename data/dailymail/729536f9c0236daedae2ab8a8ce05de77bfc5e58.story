Federal judges have struck down gay marriage bans in Indiana and Utah today in a pair of ruling that granted massive victories for same-sex couples and could force same-sex unions on four other states that currently ban them.

In Indiana, a judge threw out the state's prohibition on gay marriages and ordered county clerks to immediately begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

The ruling against Utah, one of the most conservative states in the nation, was more sweeping, though less immediate.

The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, in ruling against Utah's gay marriage ban, said categorically that states cannot ban same sex unions because they are protected under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees equal protection under the law.

The ruling affects six states in the 10th Circuit, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming - making such prohibitions illegal there, too.

New Mexico already allows gay marriage, but the remaining states have laws prohibiting it.

However, the three judge panel immediately put their ruling on hold pending appeal, which the Utah Attorney General has promised to file.

The next step is for the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the issue again.

'A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union,' the 10th Circuit said in its 2-1 ruling on Utah.

Supporters of gay marriage in the conservative state, where the Mormon church wields substantial political and social influence, planned a celebratory rally on Wednesday night in Salt Lake City.

Utah briefly became the 18th U.S. state where marriage rights were extended to same-sex couples when a federal district judge ruled in December 2013 that a state ban on gay matrimony was unconstitutional.

That decision was put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court pending appeals, but not before more than 1,300 gay and lesbian couples tied the knot.

Utah lawmakers who oppose gay marriage had argued that the state's ban, known as Amendment 3, was approved by voters and that same-sex marriages were new enough that evidence about their impact on families might not fully be known.

But the court said the state could not restrict the right to marry, or its recognition of marriage, 'based on compliance with any set of parenting roles, or even parenting quality.'

'We cannot embrace the contention that children raised by opposite-sex parents fare better than children raised by same-sex parents,' it said in its ruling.

Separately, U.S. District Judge Richard Young in Indianapolis said Indiana's ban on same-sex marriage violated the Constitution's due process and equal protection clauses, and he ordered officials to start issuing marriage licenses.

And a legal battle over Florida's gay marriage ban intensified this week as state Attorney General Pam Bondi said she will defend the measures approved by voters in 2008 in challenges to be heard soon in Orlando and Miami Beach.

Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller has promised to appeal the ruling and asked he judge to stay his ruling and halt gay marriage in Indiana, pending the appeal.
