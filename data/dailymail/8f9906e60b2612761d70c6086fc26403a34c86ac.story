By day he is a hedge fund tycoon and generous philanthropist.

But by night self-made millionaire Talal Shakerchi is a regular addition at some of the biggest poker games in Europe.

And on Saturday, he took on the big players of the poker world - but went on to blow a cool £850,000 at the table.

Talal Shakerchi reportedly blew 1.1million euros during his high-stakes game on Saturday

The Midlands-born millionaire was one of six players to pay €500,000 for a seat at an unofficial game at the final of the European Poker Tour in Monaco on Saturday night.

The 49-year-old began his life in finance on the BP graduate training scheme and set up his own hedge-fund, Meditor, in 1998.

He is believed to be one of the best stock-pickers in today's financial world and has around £3billion worth of assets under management, according to The Times.

The financier's route to playing games with such high stakes began as a hobby five years ago on online multi-table tournaments.

'I was lucky to be in a position to play in high buy-in events, which gave me the chance to observe the best players in action and to learn from them,' Shakerchi told the newspaper.
