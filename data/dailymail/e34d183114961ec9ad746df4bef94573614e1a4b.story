Thrill-seeker Garrett McNamara has taken the Guinness World Record for the largest wave ever surfed after riding a 78-foot tall break off the coast of Portugal in November.

Confirmed by a panel of experts at the annual Billabong XXL Global Big Wave Awards, McNamara, 44, beat the previous mark held since 2008 by surfing legend Mike Parson by just one foot.

Barreling down the enormous wave at Nazaré, McNamara risked being drowned or crushed by the enormous wall of water he was riding to take the coveted crown.

'It’s amazing we get to do what we do, I am so grateful. The world record doesn’t mean as much to me, this is for the town of Nazaré and Portugal and for all my family and friends there,' said McNamara at the Billabong awards ceremony in Anaheim, California.

'To be able to give them something to be proud of and inspire them… I didn’t want to get caught up in it all, but I have to tell you the truth, when they announced my name I got a bigger rush than probably on all the waves I rode this year.'

The fierce wave formed off the coast of Nazaré, Portugal an area known for its funneled waves caused by the low shallow ocean floor at the shore

Taking to the sea on the morning of 
November the 1st, 2011, McNamara had been invited to Nazaré by the 
Government of Portugal to investigate the area for a big wave 
competition.

'There is an underwater canyon 1,000ft deep that runs from the ocean right up to the cliffs,' explained McNamrara in an interview with the Guardian last year.

'It's like a funnel.

'At its oceans end it's three miles wide but narrows as it gets closer to the shore and when there is a big swell it acts like an amplifier.'

As a veteran surfer of enormous waves, McNamara used buoyancy aids to help him return to the surface if wiped out and was towed onto the wave by a jet-ski rider.

The Pittsfield, Massachusetts born 
surfer also used a specially weighted surf board that provides extra 
momentum on release from the jet-ski.

Stunned
 by his own achievement in surfing the wave, McNamara had to navigate 
not only the 78-foot tall wall of water, but also the lip of the wave as
 it came to halt as it approached the shore.

Weighing tons, the cresting lip could
 have knocked him off the board and into a spin cycle under the water 
that would have either drowned him or broken bones with the force of the
 water.

However, McNamara skillfully and successfully navigated the wave to set the record.

'It's only when I got in that I saw the footage,' said McNamara to the Guardian.

'I was in awe. I mean I felt it was a decent size.

'But you can see it then pops up 10, 20, 30 feet higher. It just supersizes.'

The legendary surfer was proud to beat the previous record holder by a single foot to take the Guinness crown

When asked how he found the courage to surf waves so large McNamara had a clear answer.

'I went to Alaska a while back and surfed the waves generated from a 
glacier calving and ever since then, I’ve never been afraid in the 
ocean. I feel very comfortable in the ocean' said McNamara.

'This wave, if you fell, I don’t think I would’ve come home.

'It’s so dangerous, so much water moving in two different directions and
 it’s all rocks. All the water is moving straight into the rocks.'
