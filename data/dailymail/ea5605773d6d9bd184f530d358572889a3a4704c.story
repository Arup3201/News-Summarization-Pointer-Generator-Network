If you want an example of a club lost in its own deluded world of self-importance, I give you Queens Park Rangers, ladies and gentlemen.

After watching their well-paid 
internationals get absolutely battered out of sight by Everton in the FA Cup at 
Goodison Park on Saturday, I took the train back to London.

Us minions waited in a 
queue to board the train at Lime Street, while the Rangers players 
ambled slowly along the platform to the first-class carriage at the 
front of the train. Quite what made them so important that the rest of 
us had to wait I’m not sure.

United: A young Everton fan and young QPR supporter before the game at Goodison Park

Harsh: Queens Park Rangers fans who tried to speak to the players on the train were turned away by security

Easy street: Everton cruised through to the fourth round of the FA Cup with victory over QPR on Saturday

Once
 on board some excited young QPR fans aged around nine or 10 ran towards
 the front of the train, hoping to get autographs from their ‘heroes’. 
They were stopped and told that security would not let them through. 
They were then advised that once the train arrived at Euston if they 
were quick they might catch the players then.

Let’s
 get this straight: QPR fans were still willing to idolise the players 
who had been embarrassingly dreadful at Everton but were
 denied that chance because those players apparently needed to be left 
alone. 

Players are lost in a world where they think they’re really important, even when they’re actually being rubbish at their jobs.

What kind of human being throws dangerous objects at a man who is lying injured on the ground right in front of them? 

And
 what sort of disgusting individual throws coins at a man on a 
stretcher? Worse than that, what kind of person throws coins knowing 
they could hit and injure St John Ambulance volunteers as they carry 
that stretcher?

Crocked: Theo Walcott will be out of action for six months after injuring his anterior cruciate ligament

Cheeky: Walcott was pelted by coins as he mocked the Tottenham fans when he was taken off injured

I’m shocked
 the debate centred on Theo Walcott’s cheeky, inoffensive reminder of 
the score. Surely the question is why haven’t Spurs and/or their fans 
been sanctioned for the disgraceful events on Saturday evening?

I find it a bit bizarre that Arsenal decided to rule Walcott out of the World Cup. 

If
 his operation is done this week there is an outside chance he will be 
back in time for the World Cup, judging by recoveries other sportsmen 
have made from the same injury. Arsenal say the operation will happen 
‘in the near future’ – there is no urgency from the club because they 
wouldn’t see any benefit from a speedy operation. Instead the Gunners 
will benefit from a fresh Theo Walcott who gets a full pre-season.

The reality is he won’t make it to Brazil. It’s a shame because he belongs on that stage.

Roy Hodgson needs Walcott; his pace and quality in front of goal make England better. I’m gutted he won’t be there.

Blow: Walcott will miss the World Cup next summer in a setback for England manager Roy Hodgson (right)

The massive gap between fans and their clubs was brought sharply into focus this weekend as not just the West Ham manager, but also the co-chairmen decided to completely disregard the club’s loyal supporters and its history. 

If I listed the years 1964, 1975 and 1980 to Sam Allardyce, David Gold and David Sullivan I wonder what their response would be.

West Ham fans would, to a man, instantly know those were the years the Hammers won the FA Cup at Wembley. Bobby Moore lifting the famous trophy, Alan Taylor’s brace, and Trevor Brooking’s header. These are what memories are made of. Not what happens on Saturday at Cardiff.

The Hammers’ European success in 1965 came about only because they won the FA Cup. So this competition is special to West Ham fans. They don’t expect to win it every year, and reluctantly accept there will be times they are knocked out by lower league clubs.

But Sam got this one all wrong. He’s made a huge mess of his job and so West Ham find themselves in the bottom three. Because of his failure, he then decides to disrespect the FA Cup and the fans by fielding a team that could not win the tie. Worse still they got thrashed and the confidence and careers of some promising youngsters have been put in a vulnerable position.

All this time there were plenty of senior players sitting around doing nothing, apparently too soft and pathetic to play three games in six days. Those players want to play in the FA Cup, they want to play in a semi-final, and they want to play at Cardiff on Saturday. So let them play.

Allardyce, once a symbol of all that was good about old-school, no-nonsense English football, has got lost in the modern game, where finishing 17th is seen as something special. In short he’s lost touch with football and fans.

Gold and Sullivan play the ‘lifelong Hammers fans’ card with relentless regularity. I appreciate they’ve got to balance the books, but no West Ham fan would back what Sam did at the weekend, so I find it shocking that the co-chairmen have declared they’re fully behind the manager.

Fans still want to win the FA Cup. Players want to win it.

Allardyce, Gold and Sullivan didn’t want to win the FA Cup this season. That’s not what West Ham are about.

History: West Ham's Johnny Byrne, Bobby Moore and Peter Brabrook on a victory lap of after the 1964 final

Special: West Ham players parade the FA Cup at Newham Town Hall after beating Fulham in the 1975 final

Last time out: West Ham have not won the FA Cup since they beat Arsenal in the final in 1980

Gold and Sullivan should be very worried by the manager’s relationship with his captain. Allardyce and Kevin Nolan go back a long way, and Sam persuaded the owners to give Nolan a massive contract in 2011 when they were in the Championship.

But after his second unnecessary red card in the space of a few weeks, Nolan had Sam perplexed, unable to understand why he had been so ‘irresponsible.’ 

Has Sam lost the respect of his captain?

Abject: West Ham were thrashed by Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round on Sunday

Losing respect: Kevin Nolan was sent off twice in four games for West Ham

Twice in recent weeks my club Peterborough United have been denied goals because officials haven’t spotted the ball went over the line – once away to Coventry on Boxing Day, and again at Kidderminster in the FA Cup on Saturday. 

What made it worse was that opposition players knew the ball had crossed the line – and admitted it afterwards – but pretended it hadn’t. 

What do I expect? How about some honesty? What would be wrong with Coventry and Kidderminster players actually saying: ‘Fair enough, our opponents have been good enough to score a goal against us, so that goal should stand’?

Naive you think? Never going to happen, you reckon?

Denied: Peterborough have twice seen goals ruled out after officials did not spot the ball crossed the line

You’re probably right. But if you’re saying it’s OK for players to blatantly lie about an honest goal being scored, then you’ve got no right to moan about players diving. 

Don’t give mixed messages to players – you either want them to play fair and honest, or you don’t. Simple.

Young QPR fans were not allowed to meet the players on the train

Arsenal are in no rush to send Theo Walcott for his operation

West Ham disregarded the fans' loyalty and the club's history at Forest

Teams not admitting the ball has crossed the line is as bad as diving
