CCTV footage has emerged of a meat-wielding woman who was arrested for throwing bacon and sausages at police last month.

The newly-released video shows 24-year-old Lindsey McNamara walking into Framingham Police Department in Massachusetts at around 11am on December 26 with a Dunkin' Donuts box.

With a bystander to her right, she opens the cardboard container to reveal pounds of raw pork. She then starts hurling it at the receptionist's bulletproof window.

The video has no sound but according to police, McNamara shouted 'it’s time to feed the pigs' as she threw the food. 

For the occasion it appears she wore a black fleece jacket, pajama, pants and slippers.

As the camera continues to roll, two police officers enter the scene.

McNamara instantly drops the Dunkin' Donuts box before being handcuffed.
