Doctors have performed a pioneering procedure to 'vacuum' a huge blood clot out of a man's heart, which they feared could kill him instantly.

Todd Dunlap, 62, became the first person to successfully undergo the procedure in California after a CT scan revealed a 24-inch clot stretching from his legs into his heart, which ran the risk of breaking loose and lodging in his lungs.

The minimally-invasive procedure, which used a devices called AngioVac, was offered to Mr Dunlap as an alternative to open-heart surgery and could be used more widely in future.

Todd Dunlap became the first person to successfully undergo a life-saving procedure in California after a CT scan revealed a 24-inch clot stretching from his legs into his heart. The minimally-invasive procedure used a device called AngioVac (pictured) to 'vacuum' out the clot as an alternative to open-heart surgery

Mr Dunlap, a new grandfather and father to two sons, did not hesitate to pick the less invasive option offered to him by Dr John Moriarty in UCLA Medical Centre's emergency room in August of this year.

Just a week after the pioneering procedure, he was back at home and eager to play with his 9-month-old grandson.

To perform the procedure, a team of radiologists and cardiovascular surgeons slid a tiny camera down Mr Dunlap's esophagus to visually monitor his heart before guiding a coiled hose though his neck artery to plug one end into his heart, against the potentially fatal clot.

They threaded the other end through a vein at the groin and hooked the hose up to a powerful heart-bypass device in the operating room to create suction.

'Once in place, the AngioVac quickly sucked the deadly clot out of Mr. Dunlap's heart and filtered out the solid tissue,' said Dr Moriarty.

Red blood cells and platelets trapped in a fibrin blood clot. Dr Kwon said retrieving a clot from within the heart used to require open-heart surgery, resulting in longer rehabilitation times

'The system then restored the cleansed blood through a blood vessel near the groin, eliminating the need for a blood transfusion.'

The procedure lasted three hours and doctors observed Mr Dunlap for seven days, first in intensive care and then in the hospital's cardiac ward.

Open-heart surgery takes twice as long to perform and often requires the surgeon to divide the breastbone lengthwise down the middle and spread the halves apart to access the heart.

After the heart is repaired, surgeons use wires to hold the breastbone and ribs in place as they heal, which requires a longer period of rehabilitation before the patient makes a full recovery.

Dr Murray Kwon, a UCLA cardiothoracic surgeon who collaborated on Mr Dunlap's procedure, said: 'Retrieving a clot from within the heart used to require open-heart surgery, resulting in longer hospitalisation, recovery and rehabilitation times compared to the minimally invasive approach provided by the AngioVac system.'

A clot-busting drug known as tPA typically takes three to four days to work and failed when doctors tried to use it on Mr Dunlap due to the clot's large size and density.

Dr Moriarty said: 'The AngioVac was the last resort for Mr. Dunlap.

'The clot clogged his heart chamber like a wad of gum in a pipe. Every moment that passed increased the risk that the clot would migrate to his lungs and kill him.

'We couldn't have asked for a better outcome.'

Mr Dunlap, who lives in Newbury Park, California, said: 'I'm thrilled that I didn't have to go through open-heart surgery.

'This procedure is a great option for the older, frail person who wouldn't survive open-heart surgery.Â  Without an alternative like this, he's a goner.'
