Brits the length and breadth of the country are currently gripped by London 2012 Olympic fever.While many of us are hugely inspired by the phenomenal achievements of the athletes, the sad reality is that only a minority of us share the same enthusiasm for being active.Scientific journal The Lancet has carried out a global study, including results from 122 countries, to establish which nations are the laziest.

Brits may be doing well at the Olympics but we also know how to relax

Ireland may be famous for it pubs and music, but no so much for its fitness. It was ranked 18th least active country in the world

The UK, it found was one of the most 
inactive countries, with a staggering 63.3% of the population being 
inactive. It was ranked eighth laziest country in the world.

The UK was put to shame when compared with its US friends. The study found 
just over 40 per cent of those in North America were inactive, putting 
it in the 46th spot.

Meanwhile, Greece was labelled the least 
lazy nation in the study. Only 15% of the population of the balmy 
Mediterranean country, which also boasts one of the world's healthiest 
diets, was classed as inactive.

An evening stroll along the Rialto Bridge on Venice's Grand Canal doesn't count as exercise. Italy ranked 17th laziest country in the world

The heat in Namibia might at least explain why the majority of the population are inactive

Relaxing by the market: According to the study, 68.3% of Argentinians are inactive

The idyllic isle of Malta may be a beautiful holiday destination, but the people too seem to enjoy sitting back and enjoying the view, since they have been ranked as the most inactive people in the world

Overall, women rated lower than men in the study. The highest percentage of inactive women was found in countries where they find it difficult to find employment due to social constraints, such as Saudi Arabia, which ranked third least active country.

Of the countries surveyed almost one third of their population is considered inactive.

And 80 per cent of adolescents rated as below the standards.The results of the study, the researchers said, are being release to coincide with the Olympic Games to help spur lazy members of the public to choose to lead more active lives.The researchers point out that lack of exercise is now a leading cause of death and a third of people across the world do not meet the minimum activity recommendations, which is generally about 2.5 hours of moderate activity per week.The following list names and shames the 20 least active countries from the study.
