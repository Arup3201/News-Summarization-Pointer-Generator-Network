Three would-be suicide bombers applied to disgraced payday lender Yes Loans for cash to fund an attack more deadly than 7/7, a court heard today.

Ashik Ali, Irfan Khalid, both 27, and Irfan Naseer, 31, were cautioned about the sky-high interest rates but believed they would never have to make repayments, it is alleged.

Ali also tried to raise funds by applying for an £18,000 business loan and claiming he was setting up his own double glazing firm, Woolwich Crown Court was told.

In the run-up to the planned attacks, 
the three discussed buying gifts including quad bikes for themselves so 
they could enjoy the final weeks before their martyrdom, jurors heard.

The trio are alleged to have planned a
series of explosions at unknown targets across the UK between December 
25, 2010, and September 19 last year.

Naseer, known as ‘Chubbs’ or ‘Big 
Irfan’ because of his size, and Khalid had travelled twice to Pakistan 
to learn about bomb-making, weapons and poisons, the court has been 
told.

But they were recorded by police 
probes as they planned the attacks in a series of conversations in 
Naseer’s green Volkswagen Passat.

The trio are said to have used 
codewords and slang to hide their true intentions, with the Arabic word 
handiya - or cooking pot - referring to a bomb.

During one exchange, Khalid also 
mimicked a Formula One commentator as he joked: ‘It’s the four suicide 
bombers driving around ready to take on England.’

In the dock: The trio were cautioned about the sky-high interest rates on payday loans, but believed they would never have to make repayments, it is alleged

He and the others were caught discussing finances with fundraiser Rahin Ahmed, 26, on September 14 last year.

‘Before leaving the car, Naseer told 
Ahmed to check with Yes Loans in the morning and all other loans,’ said 
prosecutor Brian Altman QC.

‘In fact, two days later, on September 15, Ahmed did submit an online application to Yes Loans for a loan of £20,000.’

Ahmed cautioned the others about 
the high interest rates offered by the payday lender, but Naseer said it
would not matter if the ‘ammal’ - Arabic for ‘right way’ or ‘right 
path’ - was carried out.

He was recorded as he told the others: ‘If the interest rate is 95 per cent but you’re gonna do the ammal, yeah?

‘Who gives a s*** what the interest rate is because you’re not gonna go up anyway?

‘But you’d only be worried and have some worry if the ammal doesn’t take place or I don’t do the ammal, yeah.’

If the ammal did not take, Naseer said he would leave the country.

Ahmed was subsequently disowned by the
other three after he lost £9,000 gambling online using money the group 
had raised by posing as collectors for Muslim Aid, jurors have been 
told.

Yes Loans, based in Cwmbran, south 
Wales, was forced to close in March this year after its credit licence 
was revoked for dishonest business practices.

Two days earlier, Ali had visited a 
branch of Barclays in Stratford Road, Birmingham to apply for a £15,000 
business loan, the court heard.

Ahmed had visited another branch in 
Frederick Street earlier that day to as about the possibility of a 
separate £18,000 loan, said Mr Altman.

‘On that same afternoon there was 
further secretly recorded conversation in the VW Passat, particularly 
between Naseer and Khalid in the initial stages, while Ashik Ali finds 
himself in yet another another Barclays Bank, this one on Stratford 
Road,’ Prosecutor Brian Altman QC told jurors.

Ashik Ali's estranged wife, Salma Kabal, 23, will also go on trial next year accused of failing to inform the authorities of her knowledge of the terror plot

‘And he’s applying for a £15,000 bank 
loan. And in that bank he was overheard by a surveillance officer 
claiming dishonestly he was registering a double glazing company called A
Ali, which he told the personal advisor had started trading on the 
previous Friday.

‘He gave his home address, said his 
total outgoings were £600 a quarter and that he was a driver, spending 
£60 per week on petrol.’

He had previously discussed posing as a carpet fitter with the others, the court has been told.

Later the same day, Naseer and Khalid 
were recorded talking about treating themselves to gifts in the run-up 
to their martyrdom, jurors heard.

Khalid said: ‘When you know your time’s coming to an end and you want to enjoy something - that’s fair play, innit? Just do it. Get what you want, chill out or whatever but do it within limits.’

Naseer added: ‘At the end of the day, I wouldn’t mind riding a quad bike. It’s good fun, yeah, but I wouldn’t do it on the road - that’s not befitting, bro.

‘A guy with a beard and that sitting on top of that doesn’t look good, bro. People will laugh at you.’

Police later uncovered a note containing bomb-making instructions which one of the gang had tried to destroy by setting fire to it at Ali's home, the court heard.

It was created after they began to step up their preparations on September 16 last year, it is alleged.

They agreed to buy a 'cold pack', used to treat sports injuries, from a pharmacy using a cover story about a bogus ailment, believing it contained an ingredient they would need to make a bomb.

Naseer, of Sparkhill, Birmingham, denies five counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts.

Khalid of Sparkbrook, Birmingham, denies four counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts.

Ali, of Balsall Heath, Birmingham, denies three counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts.

Four men - Ishaaq Hussain, 20, Naweed 
Ali, 24, Khobaib Hussain, 20, and Shahid Khan, 20 - have all admitted 
flying to Pakistan for terrorist training in August 2011.

Ahmed has admitted preparing for 
terrorism by collecting money and investing it for terrorist acts, and 
by assisting others to travel to Pakistan for terrorist training.

Ashik Ali’s brother Bahader, 29, and Mohammed Rizwan, 33, are to stand trial next year accused of terrorist offences

Ashik Ali’s estranged wife, Salma 
Kabal, 23, will also go on trial next year accused of failing to inform 
the authorities of her knowledge of the plot.

The trial continues.
