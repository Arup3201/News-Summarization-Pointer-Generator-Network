A police force spent £11million of taxpayers' money on a new headquarters which they never moved in to and have now sold at a loss, it has emerged.

Hampshire Constabulary bought the industrial property in 2008 for £9.6million pounds after deeming their former headquarters in Winchester 'unfit for purpose'.

But, after five years and an additional £1.8million, the force sold the property at Alpha Park near Eastleigh, Hampshire, at a loss.

A Hampshire Police Federation spokesman described the purchase and sale of the property as 'very embarrassing'

The exact figure of the sale is unknown, though Hampshire Police sources revealed it was less than the sum paid for the property in 2008.

The sale comes after a review revealed the project would cost another £13.75million to complete to the required standard.

Today Hampshire's Police and Crime commissioner Simon Hayes said: 'We have agreed a price with a purchaser and Alpha Park has been sold subject to a survey.

'We always knew, and I said when I launched the new estates strategy, that we were going to sell it at less than we have purchased it all those years ago.

'But the important thing is we get as much for it as we can in the current market.

'The decision I had to make was how long do we hold on to it because it’s costing us money just to keep the dust off it and keep it secure.

'That was a decision I had to make and I felt that the offer we have got is a good one.'

The Chairman of Hampshire Police Federation today described the sale as 'very embarassing' for the force.

John Apter said: 'This has drawn a line under a very embarrassing period for the constabulary.

'Most people I speak to are still baffled by the decision to buy Alpha Park in the first place.'

He added: 'Mr Hayes must promise us as a constabulary and also the taxpayer that this will never happen again.

'It’s been a bit of a festering sore but it is good to move on. The police buildings in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight have not been a top priority for many, many years.

'What is refreshing is there now appears to be a light at the end of a very long tunnel.'

The Audit Commission has scrutinised the Hampshire Police Authority’s decision to buy Alpha Park in 2008, and concluded that the purchase was not unreasonable.

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said the money received from the sale of Alpha Park will be go back into proposals for revamping the force’s estates.

Hampshire Constabulary recently revealed 448 officers and 436 staff jobs were to be cut after being told to save £55million in Government cuts.
