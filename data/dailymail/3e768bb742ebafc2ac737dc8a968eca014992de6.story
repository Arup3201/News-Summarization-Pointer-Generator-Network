It seems some wealthy Atlantans aren't keen on the prospect of a drag-racing, egg-throwing Canadian teenager for a neighbor.

Residents of the well-to-do Buckhead neighborhood are planning to stage a protest outside the Blackland Road property the pop star has his eye on.

Given Bieber's prior egg-throwing antics at his Calabasas residence, which are now under investigation by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, the residents' wariness is understandable.

Event: Residents have no intention of welcoming Bieber with open arms to the wealthy Atlanta neighborhood of Buckhead

Baby, no: Bieber's antics at his Calabasas residence, including causing $20,000 of damage to his neighbor's house with eggs, have earned him a bad rep

The event is set for Monday and so far 136 people have committed to the 6am event.

'As a community here in Buckhead, we have worked hard to achieve our goals and get to where we are. Justin Bieber’s relocation to Atlanta can be nothing but bad for our children, as well as the community,' reads a statement on the Facebook page.

'Some can’t even let their children play in the driveway without fear; he has raced vehicles under the influence before. What’s to say he won’t do it again?

'As a homeowner down the street from this residence, one can assume many people will be contacting real estate agents soon enough. Please do not allow a child to ruin what we have worked so hard to obtain. Thanks for the support!'

The home in question is an $11 million, seven-bedroom, 16,000 mansion built in 2010, reportedly near where his mentor Usher lives.

TMZ reports that the baby-faced singer wants to be closer to the hip hop community in Atlanta, which is home to T-Pain, TI and Rick Ross, among others.

Buckhead Neighborhood Coalition President Sam Massell says he's not planning to attend the protest but that the protesters have a right to express how they feel.

According to NBC 11, the neighborhood is already home to celebrities including Janet Jackson and Elton John, who received a warm welcome to the area.

Massell says that he himself was the target of picketers when he moved there after being elected mayor in the early 1970s.

'I think picketing is an American form of expressing yourself,' he said, adding that Bieber has a right to buy a home anywhere he wants.

The Coalition's Facebook page says it was formed to 'protect the character and heritage of the Buckhead community.'

It works to preserve '[Buckhead's historic look and feel by fighting damaging influences from within and without.'

Bieber has reportedly been in Atlanta for about two weeks working with rapper TI.

'Back in my second home,' he tweeted shortly after arriving.

He's currently staying in the spaceship-like home of producer Dallas Austin.
