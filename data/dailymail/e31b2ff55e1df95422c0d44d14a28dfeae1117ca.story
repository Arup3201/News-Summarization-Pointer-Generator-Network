White House fan Ron Wade has built an exact replica of the Oval Office in his home costing more than $200,000.

The father-of-two painstakingly recreated the White House's most famous room over four years. 

Obsessed Mr Wade also owns the world's largest collection of presidential memorabilia which is squeezed into the family home.

Obsessive: White house fan Ron Wade has built an exact replica of the Oval Office in his home costing more than $200,000

Mr Wade, 63, from Longview, Texas, said: 'When I told people I was going to build the Oval Office I don't think they realised that it was going to be exactly the same as the one the president sits in everyday.

'But it's identical down to the last detail.

'I had George W Bush look at a blow-up photo of my Oval Office and he said "you've got it down, everything is just right."

Now Mr Wade gives tours of his collection, which includes JFK's former car and rocking chair and a dresser bought by Calvin Coolidge.

Mr Wade said: 'I have no idea how much the collection is worth - there are so many pieces from the White House which I couldn't put a value to. 

'I wish i had a warehouse that I could fill with about 200 file cabinets more. 

'I work every single day classifying items in my collection and putting them in order.'

But it is the replica Oval Office which stuns visitors with its attention to detail.

Mr Wade said: 'The reaction to this room is really wonderful.

'People say, "Oh my god, it's just like the real one we've seen on TV".

'I spent years in planning, using 350 photographs of the real Oval Office so every little detail was complete.'

And Ron's wife Laura, 36, and children, Valentina, 16, and Laura, 10, love living among the collection. 

Mrs Wade said: 'It's like you're living in a museum but it's really beautiful. 

'I love sharing our home with other people and telling them the history of each item.

Over the years Mr Wade's collection has grown taking over much of his family home in Texas

'I sometimes wish we had more space as a family but I support Ron 100 per cent.'

Over the years Mr Wade's collection has grown taking over much of his home. 

He said: 'I add pieces to it every day and I've tried to list them at one time and come up with an inventory but it's just really impossible. I have too many items.'

One highlight of the collection is a Lincoln car which once belonged to U.S. President John F Kennedy. 

Mr Wade said: 'I was perusing on eBay and of all things this Lincoln, formally owned by JFK showed up.

'I was fascinated and didn't think I I would ever be able to win. But I bid and I won it.'

Mr Wade first developed a taste for politics after assisting George Bush Snr's campaign for the presidency when he was just 13. 

In 1970 he teamed up with George W Bush to campaign for Bush Snr once again. 

Mr Wade said: 'For forty years I have been good friends with both of the former presidents.

'I've had the good fortune since I was in high school to know at various times seven United States presidents including Lydon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Cater and Ronald Regan.'

Despite all the years of hard work put into his museum, Mr Wade is happy to enjoy it as long as it lasts.

He said: 'My children have expressed an interest in turning my house into a museum - they say it's already a museum now.

'I've told them they can do what they want with it when I am gone. I've enjoyed it while I was here. It's just been fun.'
