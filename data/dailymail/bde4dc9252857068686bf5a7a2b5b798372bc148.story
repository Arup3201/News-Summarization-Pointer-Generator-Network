Locked up: Yadina Morales, 22, has been sentenced to 15 months for the death of her baby

A mother who smothered her two-month-old daughter to death after passing out as she drunkenly breastfed her has been sentenced to 15 months in prison.

Yadina Morales, 22, was also sentenced to three years of probation after entering an Alford plea to manslaughter in Washington County Circuit Court, Maryland on Tuesday.

The Alford plea means the mother-of-three is not 
admitting to the crime, but recognizes that she would likely be found 
guilty a trial.

The judge sentenced her to eight years, but suspended all but 15 months and all other charges against her were dropped as part of the plea deal, Your4State reported.

Both Morales and her baby daughter Marilyn Bryant, were both found unconscious in their Hagerstown home on November 2, 2013 by the baby's father, Dwayne Bryant.

'We found that the mother was highly 
intoxicated and had actually been breastfeeding the child and passed out
 and ultimately smothered the child,' Sheriff Douglas Mullendore told NBC last year.

The
 baby was rushed to hospital but she could not be saved.

According to court records, 
the baby's father, Mr Bryant, called emergency services who found him 
screaming in the car park of the couple's home, Business Insider reported.

'She had no idea what was going on. She 
didn't even know EMS had been there and took her child to the hospital,'
 a police deputy said in court documents.

The infant's autopsy report ruled her death was the result of an accident by overlay.

A blood test found Morales was three times over the legal drink-drive limit.

Her boyfriend told police she had been drinking vodka before she started feeding the baby.

Nursing mothers are advised to not drink while breastfeeding because the level of alcohol in breast milk and the mother's blood is the same.

Women are also advised against falling asleep next to newborns because of the risk of suffocation.

Mr Bryant told police he left Morales feeding the baby on the sofa and went to visit friends at a nearby house.

When
 he returned the next morning he moved Morales and found that their baby 
girl was not breathing, had blood coming from her nose and had turned 
blue.

Morales was 
taken to hospital as a precaution and later charged with manslaughter, 
second-degree child abuse and reckless abandonment.

The
 young mother allegedly told police she remembered having a glass of 
beer but couldn't say how much alcohol she had consumed, court documents
 said.
