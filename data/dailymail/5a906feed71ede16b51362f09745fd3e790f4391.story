A pair of Game Of Thrones fans took their love of the show to somewhat extreme lengths when they tied the knot in a ceremony inspired by the bloodthirsty fantasy show.

Thankfully though, this was no Red Wedding like the massacre that occurs in the hit series in which pretty much all family and friends at the gathering were murdered!

But Darren Prew and Kerry Ford, from Hereford, did dress up rather convincingly as their favourite characters for their big day.

Darren, a 37-year-old plasterer, was 
transformed into Night’s Watch warrior Jon Snow while his 33-year-old 
bride dressed as Daenerys Targaryen.

The pair found a castle, Eastnor Castle near Ledbury in Herefordshire, for the big bash and 12 members of the wedding party spent more than 50 hours being transformed into fantasy characters from the show.

Ms Ford even arrived at the service on a white horse, while Mr Prew arrived with two fierce looking dogs on leashes.

The pair won the marriage makeover when they entered a competition held by streaming service blinkbox Movies who are showing the fourth series of the hit show.

Ms Ford said, 'I was on Facebook one evening and I saw an advert seeking couples to marry in Game of Thrones style. I mentioned it to Darren, but said "Who on earth would do that?" Little did I know that he then went online and applied - without telling me.'

But she was impressed by her new husband’s makeover, saying: 'I thought the transformation was amazing, it was like marrying Jon Snow. It was very, very weird and surreal to see Darren like that.'

Mr Prew, who said it was 'too good an opportunity to pass up', added: 'We were planning on getting married next year, but I knew we just had to go for it. I have been a massive Game of Thrones fans since the beginning, so having our biggest day styled in such an amazing way is a dream come true.'

Ms Ford, a professional cake designer, spent two weeks creating an elaborate five tier wedding cake and said: 'It’s comprised of each of the Game of Thrones houses, then there are the wedding vows from Game of Thrones, King Joffrey’s crown made out of chocolate and it's topped with the famous iron throne.

'It was almost a shame to see it eaten. I changed my mind over the design of this cake so many times. It’s the most important cake I’ll ever make.'

Adrian Letts, MD of blinkbox Movies added: 'We are obsessed with Game of Thrones and we wanted to reward a couple that are as passionate about it as us.'
