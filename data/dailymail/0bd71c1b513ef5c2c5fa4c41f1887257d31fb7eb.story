Melissa, a 15-year-old school girl from Penwortham in Preston was described as 'lively and thoughtful' 

Steve Flynn, club chairman for Cadley FC, said: 'Everyone at the club is deeply saddened, it is a big shock.

'All of teams have been informed and we have been overwhelmed with the outpouring of support we have received from other teams in the league.'

He continued: 'She was really conscientious and thoughtful - so much so that she rang the team manager when she was on her way to say she was running late.

'We are just all in shock and can't imagine what her family must be going through.'

He said as a mark of respect to Melissa, all Cadley FC games across the league will be postponed next weekend. 

A statement from Cadley FC said: 'Today one of our Under 16's girls collapsed during a football match and despite everyone's efforts medical staff were unable to resuscitate her.

'We are all devastated by the news and our thoughts are with her family, friends and team mates at this sad time.'

Lancashire Police said her death is not being treated as suspicious and a post-mortem examination will be carried out to established the cause of death.

Opposition coach Mick Walsh said: 'It happened just before half-time. There was nobody around the girl at the time but she suddenly fell to the ground between the halfway line and the penalty box.

'We got the defibrillator and tried CPR while the ambulance was called.

'We all hoped and prayed that she'd make a full recovery but it was to no avail.

'Our thoughts are with Cadley FC and the family. I've been involved in football for 40 years and nothing like this has happened before - and I hope it never happens again.'

Melissa had played for the team for five years and was also said to be a supporter of Preston North End

Euxton Girls' chairman Dennis Winn said: 'We're absolutely devastated and our deepest sympathies go out to Cadley FC and the family of the young girl.

'We only bought the defibrillator this year and never expected to have to need it but it was all in vain.'

Today, Karen Pomeroy, head teacher at Penwortham Girls High School, paid tribute to the pupil.

She said: 'We are heartbroken to have lost such an enthusiastic and warm-hearted girl. Melissa was so bubbly, so full of life, and she will be greatly missed by the entire school community.

'She was a shining star on stage, known for her wit and valued for her contribution to the wider life of the school. Melissa went out of her way to care for others and we will all feel her loss deeply.

'We know how much she will be missed by her many friends, and we will make sure we look after all our girls at this very sad time.

'Our thoughts are also with Melissa’s family and we have already been in touch with them to offer our sincere condolences.'

Another friend, Livi Briggs, wrote: 'Rest in peace gorgeous, you were one of the nicest people.' 

The sudden collapse of Fabrice Muamba in a football match between Bolton and Tottenham shocked the footballing community 

Since Marc-Vivien Foé collapsed while playing for Cameroon in the 2003 Confederations Cup, a number of professional players have suffered fatal cardiac arrests.

In 2007, Sevilla's Antonio Puerta in 2007 and  Motherwell's Phil O'Donnell died after suffering a cardiac arrest against Dundee United in 2007.

Two years later, Espanyol defender Dani Jarque died while on a pre-season tour in Italy. 

In 2012, Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest during Bolton's FA Cup tie against Tottenham.  

He suffered a cardiac arrest in the 31st minute and received treatment on the pitch before being rushed to hospital. He survived.

Most recently, Piermario Morosini died after suffering a cardiac arrest in a Serie B match for Livorno against Pescara.

Since the 19th century more than 80 footballers are known to have died suddenly while playing.

BBC broadcaster Jacqui Oatley wrote on Twitter: 'This is heart-breaking. A teenage girl dying while playing football in Lancs. Thoughts with Melissa's family.' 

Tributes were also paid on Cadley FC's Facebook page, including many from local amateur football teams.  

Every week in the UK, 12 apparently fit and healthy young people, under the age of 35, die from undiagnosed cardiac conditions.

The defect is usually due to an inherited condition rather than a general lack of fitness.

Indeed sport stars may be at greater risk because intense activity can significantly increase a person's risk of heart attack if they have a heart abnormality.

Dr Steve Cox, the Cardiac Risk in Young's Director of Screening, has called for more screening.

He told MailOnline: 'In Italy, where there is mandatory screening in place, there has been an 89 per cent reduction in sudden deaths in young people, so we feel it's important. 

'While it is fantastic that defibrillators are available, it's not the answer to saving young people's lives. It's not enough when a young person collapses. We need to identify the problems before then and can help by prescribing certain drugs, or warning off certain medication.

'We are very passionate about the idea that all young people from 14 onwards are offered the chance to be tested and it's even more important if they are involved in sport.'  

In March 2012, former England U21 international Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest during an FA Cup match between Bolton and Tottenham. 

It took 78 minutes for Muamba's heart to start working on its own again before he was carried off on a stretcher and rushed to the London Chest Hospital. 

He has made incredible progress since and now works to raise awareness on cardiac health.

In another incident that rocked the footballing world, Marc-Vivien Foé, then a player for Manchester City, collapsed while playing for Cameroon in the 2003 Confederations Cup and suffered a fatal cardiac arrest.
