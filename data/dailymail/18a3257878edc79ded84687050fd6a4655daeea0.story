When 18-year-old St Mirren youngster Stephen Mallan picked the ball up on the half way line against Dundee on Saturday, he could only have have dreamed about what was about to happen.

Appearing in just his fifth senior game for The Buddies, Mallan scored his first senior goal in spectacular fashion.

Nicking the ball from Dundee's Callum Morris just inside his own half, Mallan began his run by fooling Stuart Armstrong with a nice stepover.

Dropping his shoulder to evade Armstrong, the 18-year-old went on to leave Calum Butcher for dead as he nutmegged him and sent him the wrong way with a faked shot.

Continuing his amazing solo run, Mallan smashed the ball home from 25 yards to bag himself a sure contender for goal of the season.  

The goal sealed the Scottish Premiership win for the Buddies as they emerged 3-1 victors over The Terrors at Dens.
