University is supposed to be the time when a young-adult enters into a voyage of self-discovery and growth.

But for some parents and their children, this daunting change has proven to be a lot harder than expected.

So Huangzhong Normal University in Wuhan, Central China, have helped with the transition, by letting families sleep together in their gymnasium for one final night.

Sleep: Parents roll out mats and blankets in the gym at Huangzhong Normal University, Central China, so they can spend one final night with their sons and daughters before they begin university

Crowded: More than 600 parents spent the night in the gym on Saturday before first year students began their studies

Sweet dreams: Three people try to shield their eyes from the bright lights of the gym. Some only have a mat and a small pillow to sleep on

The university opened its gym overnight on Saturday to allow 600 parents of freshmen students to sleep on mats laid out on the floor.

The parents were accompanying their children on their first day of school.

It is not clear how thrilled the children were to have their over-bearing families with them.

Gym: Three men sleep next to a cage of Basketballs and rolled up sports maps. One man (pictured left) cradles around his bag while fully clothed

Wrapped-up: Two people in this photo have managed to get a blanket each to try and make their night more comfortable

Popular: The event, which has become an annual traditional, is hugely popular, with almost double the amount of participants since the same night in 2008

The university held the same event in 2008, when 350 parents took the opportunity to bed down with their children.

But since then, it has grown in popularity with nearly double the number of families sleeping on the floor of the gym this time around.

Empty nest syndrome is said to be the grief and loneliness guardians feel when their children leave home for the first time.

Even though it evidently affects a huge number of families, it is not said to be a clinical condition.

Improvised pillows: A man and a woman use their bags as head rests against the hardwood floor of the gymnasium

Awake: A father looks into the lights of the sports hall as other parents try to sleep around him

Heart-to-heart: A mother sits up talking with her son has he prepares to embark on his journey away from home and into higher education

Tired: One man looks sound asleep as he sleeps with his head on folded sheets and has himself wrapped up in a green blanket

Inside: Chinese flag hangs above 600 parents and their children who try and overcome 'empty nest' syndrome by spending one final night together
