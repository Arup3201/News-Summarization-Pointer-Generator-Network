One in three families has shopped at budget supermarket Aldi.

The growth in the chain's popularity comes as the 'big four' all suffered a fall in market share for the first time on record.

It confirms the cost of living squeeze has triggered a major shift in the nation's shopping habits.

The 'big four' supermarkets have seen a fall in their market share, while 'budget' store Aldi (pictured) appears to have reaped the rewards

Shopper numbers at Aldi are up by 16 per cent on a year ago, while the amount each customer spends has risen by 15 per cent.

By
contrast Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons all saw an annual fall 
in market share – the first time in at least ten years that all the big 
players have slumped.

Retail
analysts Kantar said Aldi's total share of the grocery market has gone 
up from 3 per cent to 3.9 per cent – and in the past 12 weeks, a third 
of British households have shopped at Aldi.

In
that time total sales were up by 31.1 per cent compared with the same 
period last year. Another budget supermarket, Lidl, has enjoyed sales 
growth of 13.8 per cent.

By 
contrast, the market share of Britain's biggest supermarket, Tesco, was 
down from 30.5 per cent to 29.8 per cent, despite £1billion being spent 
on a turnaround plan.

Asda's
share fell from 17.6 per cent to 17.2 per cent, Sainsbury's from 16.9 
per cent to 16.8 per cent, and Morrisons' from 11.7 per cent to 11.5 per
cent.

Almost a third of British households have shopped at Aldi in the past 12 weeks according to new figures

A study by retail experts Verdict found Aldi was taking customers from all of the major supermarkets.

It is now even attracting a large number of better-off shoppers – 18 per cent of Aldi shoppers last year were middle class.

The
German-owned chain has made a  conscious effort to attract these 
shoppers with award-winning food, from Aberdeen Angus fillet steaks at 
£5 to a highly regarded fresh pure breed Roly Poly Turkey at £39.99 for 
Christmas.

Edward Garner, 
from Kantar Worldpanel, said: 'The number of shoppers visiting Aldi has 
grown by 16 per cent year-on-year. In fact, almost a third of British 
households have shopped in Aldi in the past 12 weeks.'

While
budget chains such as Aldi and Lidl are doing well, the figures show 
premium stores, such as Waitrose, are also selling strongly, confirming 
it is the mid-range supermarkets that are being squeezed.

Sales
at Waitrose are up by 8.8 per cent in a year. Mr Garner said: 'This 
Christmas shoppers will be seeking both luxury and lower prices.'
