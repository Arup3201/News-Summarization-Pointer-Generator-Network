One in three shops in Britain's high streets lie empty despite the economic recovery, researchers have warned.

Retailers lay blame with out-of-town supermarkets, online shopping, expensive parking and high business rates. 

The figures also underline the severity of the North-South wealth divide.

Shut: In Harlepool, County Durham, 27.3 per cent of stores in the town are up for rent 

Second worst was Stockport in Greater Manchester which has seen the number of empty shops go up – despite being one of 27 'Portas Towns' to get £100,000 ­government grants to attract shoppers

The image shows the towns in Britain that have the most stores up for rent - Hartlepool has the worst vacancy rate with 27.3 per cent of stores up for rent. The map shows the vacancy rate is highest in the North West

Hartlepool in County Durham has the worst vacancy rate, with 27.3 per cent of stores up for rent.

This is followed by Stockport in Greater Manchester, with 27.2 per cent and Walsall, in the West Midlands, at 26.5 per cent.

The figures come from a study of 3,000 town centres and retail parks by Local Data Company.

The vacancy rate in the North West - the worst-hit area - is 16.9 per cent. 

It has risen in the last year by 0.4 per cent in the North East to 16.4 per cent. In contrast, London's vacancy is 7.9 per cent.

Walsall, in the West Midlands, has 26.5 per cent empty shops - retailers lay blame with out-of-town supermarkets, online shopping, expensive parking and high business rates

1) The North West - worst region at 16.9 per cent

2) The North East - up 0.4 per cent to 16.4 per cent

3) London - 7.9 per cent

4) Whole of the UK - 11.9 per cent 

Matthew Hopkinson, of Local Data Company, told the Sunday Mirror: 'Of the top 10 worst town centres for vacant retail and leisure premises, all of which are above 23 per cent, six are in the North East or North West.

'Of the top 10 best-performing town centres with the least vacant units, seven are in London and the South East.' 

He added: 'People have to realise these town centres are not going back to pre-2008 levels and accept at least 20 per cent of shops there are no longer required. They have got to create smaller centres that pull viable businesses into a vibrant core.'

The British Retail Consortium said the way rates are set is unfair on high street shops and has called for a reform of the business rates system. 

It said retailers pay £7billion a year - which is £500million more than three years ago.  

Another problem for high street shops is that more than 10 per cent of retail spending is now online, while many shoppers go to out-of-town retail parks to avoid pricey town centre parking charges.  

'Portas Towns' got £100,000 ­government grants

In 2012 TV guru Mary Portas was appointed by the government to bring about a revival in areas worst affected by the economic downturn and the rise of out-of-town shopping centres. 

The businesswoman and presenter was hired to turn around town centres in places like Bedford, Dartford and Margate, with a share of a £1.2million fund.

The first 12 Portas Pilot towns were Bedford in Bedfordshire, Croydon in Greater London, Dartford in Kent, Bedminster in Bristol, Liskeard in Cornwall, Margate in Kent, Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, Nelson in Lancashire, Newbiggin by the Sea in Northumberland, Stockport in Greater Manchester, Stockton on Tees in Teesside and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands.

They were promised an injection of life, with more markets, better branding and pop-up shops. Ideas included ‘guerilla gardening’, street art, town criers and bicycle rickshaw services.

However, many of her main recommendations including free parking and cheaper business rates were not taken up by ministers.

She also faced criticism for the review with some calling it 'too nostalgic' and a 'PR stunt'.  

Since the dark ages, governments have used a tax on residential and commercial property to pay for local services.

But store groups are struggling to keep their costs and prices down to fend off competition from online rivals.

The problem is not so much the imbalance in the amount of corporation tax paid by the likes of Amazon and Starbucks - compared with their UK-domiciled rivals - but business rates.

At a time when online sales are rising fast and traditional retailers are struggling, business rates are effectively a tax on the high street.

Internet retailers pay zero in terms of business rates because they have no bricks and mortar stores - in other words, high street buildings.

However, the traditional store chains find they are seeing profits fall but are paying a lot more in business rates. 

The unfairness has become a hot political issue and it is a key topic being discussed at the Labour Party conference in Manchester last week.

Labour wants a 1 per cent cut in business rates if it wins the 2015 General Election. This is worth around £1billion.

More than 100 business leaders have called for the changes.
