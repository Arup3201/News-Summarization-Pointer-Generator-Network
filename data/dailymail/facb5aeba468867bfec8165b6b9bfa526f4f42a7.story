BT has pulled the plug on dial-up internet access with its last modem bank to be switched off on Saturday.

The telecoms group said that only a small number of its customers were still using a dial-up modem to access the internet.

All customers were first informed of the decision in May and June this year, according to BT.

  •    In 2012, 21 million households in Great Britain (80 per cent) had Internet access, compared with 19 million (77 per cent) in 2011.

•    The number of households with Internet access has increased by 7.1 million (23 percentage points) since 2006, when directly comparable records began.

•    In 2012, 93 per cent of households with Internet access used a fixed broadband connection, of which 30 per cent used a cable or fibre optic connection.

•    Of the 5.2 million households without Internet access, the most common reason for not having a connection was that they 'did not need it' (54 per cent).

The group’s dial-up service is currently £17.25 per month, and its cheapest broadband package costs £10 per month.

Around 1,000 people living in rural areas, who struggle to access broadband, will have to move to BT’s subsidiary Plusnet if they want to keep a dial-up connection.

The once-familiar screeching dial-up connection was first introduced in the UK by Pipex in March 1992.

Using an analogue modem connected to a Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) line, internet users were able to get online at speeds reaching 56.6 kilobits per second.

In comparison, broadband technologies operate in the megabits-per-second range.

In 2012, 93 per cent of households 
with internet access used a fixed broadband connection, of which 30 per 
cent used a cable or fibre optic connection.

The number for dial-up users has fallen so low nationally it's difficult to get any accurate figures from a survey sample, but current estimates are in the low hundreds of thousands.

Earlier this month, government statistics revealed the only a third of elderly people in the UK have ever used the internet.

By region, London and the South East have the highest proportion of Internet users at 89 per cent, while Northern Ireland has the lowest at 79 per cent.

The statistics came out in the same week that Facebook has said the UK is leading the way in Europe by accessing the social network on mobile phones.

A separate report by media regulator Ofcom in March, said UK adults spend more than 15 hours online each week – up by five hours from six years ago.
