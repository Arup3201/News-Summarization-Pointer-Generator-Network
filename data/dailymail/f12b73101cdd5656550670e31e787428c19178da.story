Culture secretary Maria Miller is rolling out a 'guide for girls' information pack for parents in order to help them bring up 'aspirational young women'

The Government is set to produce a 'guide for girls' information pack for parents in order to help them bring up 'aspirational young women'.

The packs will include information on education and career choices for young women to help them 'realise their potential'.

The campaign is being rolled out by women's minister and culture secretary Maria Miller amid concerns that today's girls and young women are lacking in ambition.

The packs are being produced in response to recommendations from the Women's Business Council (WBC), which was set up last year to advise government on what more can be 
done to maximise women's contribution to economic growth.

The number of women chief executives listed in the FTSE 100 has fallen in the past year.

Just three women head large London-listed firms, the Observer reports.

In a report set to be published on Tuesday the WBC is expected to say that a key task is to 'broaden girls' aspirations and job choices before the start of their working lives'.

It also says increasing the number of women in the workforce could help stimulate economic growth by as much as 0.5 per cent a year.Â 

The report says that if women were setting up businesses at the same rate as men, there could be as many as 1 million more female entrepreneurs.

Ms Miller told the Observer that ensuring women are successful at work and in business is essential for a strong economy.

She added: 'Encouraging women to fulfil their potential doesn't begin when they are already working; it starts when they are young, still at school.

A vital part of future career success is the aspirations that girls have early in their lives, and the choices they make about subjects and qualifications.

'Parents are vital in helping girls make these choices, and we know that many parents want help with that. '

The government wants there to be 25 per cent female representation in FTSE 100 boardrooms by 2015.

However, progress has been slow - currently just 5.6 per cent of FTSE 100 directors are women.

If the target is not reached, business secretary Vince Cable has threatened to impose quotas for women in the boardroom.
