Today show co-host Tamron Hall has finally embraced her curls, appearing on TV this morning sporting her natural hair for the first time.

The 43-year-old announced her foray into the follicular unknown on Twitter, stating: 'Keeping my promise this morning to the Queen of #naturalhair @CurlyNikki This morning on @TODAYshow no flat iron no heat no chemicals :)'

An hour later, she elaborated on her reasons behind ditching the styling apparatus, tweeting: 'I was out with @BearGrylls until midnight living in the wild. Got 4hrs of sleep simply too tired to blow dry and flat iron my hair.'

Ta-da! Today show co-host Tamron Hall, 43, (pictured) showcased her natural hair on air yesterday, tweeting that she had been up until midnight filming a special with Bear Grylls and was 'too tired' to style it

Ms Hall is referring to her part in NBC's new reality series, Running Wild with Bear Grylls, which sees the British survival specialist take a handful of U.S. stars off into the wilderness to be 'stripped of all the benefits of celebrity,' and pushed 'out of their comfort zones.'

As the only woman scheduled to appear in the series - which has so far signed up Zac Efron, Ben Stiller and Channing Tatum - it's no wonder Ms Hall is pushing her beauty routine a few rungs down the priority pole.

'I was out with @BearGrylls until 
midnight living in the wild. Got 4hrs of sleep simply too tired to blow 
dry and flat iron my hair'

Ms Hall, though appearing sheepish when she admitted on air that she had until then never been on TV without taming her curls, was flooded with compliments.

Co-host Savannah Guthrie tweeted: 'Loving @TamronHall's hair this morning!'

NewsHour host Gwen Ifill echoed the applause, posting: 'Is there an @tamronshair account yet? Get on it!'

And according to Carson Dailey, the rest of the twittersphere was awash with praise too, telling Ms Hall during the segment: 'Every two seconds there's a whole thing about your hair...You rock.'

First time: Ms Hall, pictured yesterday (left), and last week sporting her usual hairstyle (right), says she does her morning hair and make-up routine by herself, and normally uses a flat iron 'daily' to 'smooth the edges'

Last month, Ms Hall detailed her usual morning regimen for Today.com; which involves a 4.30am daily start, a spot of prayer and meditation, and a 30 minute hair and make-up session, which she claims to do herself.

'I find more things to "fix" the longer I take,' she wrote. 'My hair is naturally curly, so I do flat iron it daily to smooth the edges, but on the weekends I go heat-free. I use a little paste on the weekdays for lift.'

Baring her natural appearance for the sake of TV is becoming something of a habit for Ms Hall, who last month tested software that predicted how she would look aged 60, and earlier this year, braved the cameras completely make-up free - although she didn't neglect to straighten her locks on that occasion.

Ms Hall, who also anchors MSNBC's NewsNation, made history in February when she became the first woman of color to co-host the Today show.

She is based in New York and lives with her two dogs.
