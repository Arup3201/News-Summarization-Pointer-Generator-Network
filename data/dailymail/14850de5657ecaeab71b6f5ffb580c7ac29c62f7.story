Police in Delaware were shocked to serve a search warrant on a home expecting to find drugs only to discover 16 large, exotic lizards, as well as a boa constrictor, being cultivated at the premises as well.

Investigators say they also found 115 grams of what is believed to be crack cocaine, 99 grams of suspected marijuana, as well as several prescription drugs and two loaded hand guns.

A small child had been also living at the apartment.

The search occurred at a home in the 5500 block of Heritage Court in Wilmington.

Dangerous: Police found 16 monitor lizards - which are illegal to keep as pets and considered dangerous, especially around children, inside a squalid apartment in New Castle - Delaware, during a search for drugs

Filthy: The reptiles were being kept in homemade cages inside the apartment, some of which can be seen here. A three-year-old was living at the home, and a cache of drugs were also seized 

The dangerous animals were identified as monitor lizards, which can grow up to six feet long. 

Monitor lizards are considered extremely dangerous, especially around children, according to 6abc Action News.

The lizards are illegal to own and are considered an exotic species, police said. 

The reptiles were being kept in homemade cages. 

Adding to the seriousness of the search, there was also a three-year-old found living at the home.

When police entered the apartment, they claim three people were trying to destroy their drug stash.

The apartment was condemned and deemed unfit for habitation. 

The three people who lived at the home - Jennifer Chadwick, 25,  Antonio Graves, 32, and Jerimiah Feaster, 28 - were all arrested at the scene.
