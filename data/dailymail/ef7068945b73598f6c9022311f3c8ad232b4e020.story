Rarely do the words concrete and glamour find themselves in the same sentence.

But it's fair to say this fascinating modern design of a hotel bar, using sections of giant concrete drainage pipes, has a touch of glamour and even allure about it.

Techne Architects have transformed this once fairly ordinary bar into a work of art by creating an innovative extension made almost entirely from 17 concrete water pipes that now dominate the striking street facade.

Work of art: This imaginative facelift of a bar in Melbourne, Australia, using concrete drainage pipes is undoubtedly intriguing

Style: Techne Architects has kitted out many of the giant pipes with leather-clad seating and wood-paneled interior, transforming the draining pipes into stylish drinking booths

Improvement: The grand, statement extension has increased the drinking area of the Prahran Hotel in Melbourne from 130m2 to 300m2 over three levels

The clever rethinking of the space has effectively turned the 130m2 back area of The Prahran Hotel in Melbourne into 300m2 over three levels

For architect Justin Northrop, the pipes add a lot more than drama to the hotel's exterior, adding an element of challenge for pie-eyed clientele.

'Inside you are climbing over the pipes, sitting in them, or on them at various levels. They have a lasting impact on the space.

'We were looking for a sense of drama and theatricality.'

The inescapable concrete pipes play an integral role in the design of the building, inside and out

Drama: The aim, said the architects, was create a space with a sense of drama and theatre

Where the enormous pipes aren't seating the bar's clientele, they are used as vast plant pots, among other things

Booths can be seen from the street, and throughout the interior of the hotel.

Each booth, that seats up to 12, features leather upholstered banquettes and is lined with recycled spotted gum slats and acoustic absorption mats.

At its core, design 'is about conviviality' says Northrop. 'It's providing people with opportunities to interact in non-standard ways, a whole variety of seating and gathering.'

To make sure there is space for serious partying, one long table on the ground floor can be dismantled to make way for an impromptu dance floor.

Taking the rough with the smooth: Wood, leather, stone, and... concrete drainage pipes, create an alluring and intimate drinking booth in this vast hotel bar

Further water piping has been used to decorate other elements of this intriguing bar

Northrop made sure the redesign featured a serious DJ deck. 'After all pubs are not meant to be places of calm and reflection,' he says.

Operations at the hotel's popular main bar, known as the Carlton Draught pub, continue as usual but with the addition of the vast and spectacular seating area.

Theme: Even the bathrooms have been kitted out with their own concrete pipes, of course
