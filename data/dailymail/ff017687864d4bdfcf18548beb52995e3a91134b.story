Set in the idyllic Derbyshire Dales, surrounded by countryside and views of the moor, a cockerel's  call may not seem too unexpected.

But for one bird, his early morning wake-up calls have led to an ASBO. 

The owners of William Welsummer, or Willy, the cockerel have been given a noise abatement notice to stop their bird making such a noise, after a complaint from a neighbour that he was waking him up too early.

Willy the cockerel has been waking neighbours up for three months at 4am and has now been given an ASBO

The noisy cockerel lives on the farm belonging to Philip and Caroline Sutcliffe in Eyam along with the rest of the couple's birds. 

They say other neighbours have never raised any problems with the bird. 

Mr Sutcliffe said:  'It's all a bit ridiculous - a bird having an ASBO-type order. We've done everything we can and so far we've managed to reduce the noise, but not put a stop to it.

'Our neighbours have been living with the crows for three years since we moved here - and we consulted with them at the time to check it was okay.'

The couple said they keep birds as a hobby.  

The ASBO was given after Simon Bee, 51, complained to Derbyshire Dales District Council. 

Willy lives in the Derbyshire Dales in the village of Eyam, which is popular with walkers and visitors to the Dales

Mr and Mrs Sutcliffe have been given the winter to try and soundproof Willie's pen to stop noise complaints 

Willy has been the subject of complaints by Simon Bee because of his regular 4am calls at the farm in Eyam

He said: 'This is not a farming community anymore. It's mainly tourism now and most of the people who live here are either retired or commuters.

'And the fact that Mr Sutcliffe has a field at the bottom of his garden does not make it a farm. I would not have moved in next to a farm, but this is a residential area.'

Mr Bee said he has been the subject of abuse since he made the complaint and it was made public.  

He said:  'Firstly, I do not want to kill the cockerel -I want this to be resolved in a way that pleases everybody.

The Sutcliffes said they have never had any problems with people complaining about Willy's noise before 

'But for three months I've been woken up every day at 4am and that's with double glazing. I work full-time and cannot cope without a proper nights' sleep.'

He claims in online criticism he has been called a 'townie' and is starting to fear for his safety. 

But Mr Bee said that now the mornings are darker- and the problem is not so pronounced - he is happy to 'put the situation on ice' until spring to give Mr and Mrs Sutcliffe time to sound-proof William's pen.

Mr Sutcliffe said he welcomed Simon's compromise and vowed to resolve the issue.
