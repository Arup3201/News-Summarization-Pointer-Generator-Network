Accused: Matthew Kay, a Newcastle crematorium worker, has been suspended after allegedly mocking his job and the dead on his Facebook page

A crematorium worker has been suspended after he apparently posted comments mocking his  job and the dead on his Facebook page.

Matthew Kay, who works as a technician at the West Road Crematorium, Fenham, Newcastle, is accused of writing a stream of vile comments on the social networking site over a period of around three years.

The Newcastle City Council employee also allegedly uploaded a photo of what appears to be the machine control buttons in the crematorium with tinsel around them, writing underneath, 'Hurrah, it took me ages to put up the Christmas decorations at work today.'

On his page, he wrote he worked as a crematorium technician for the council and described his job as, 'Full-time Cook.'

One of the most offensive status updates on Mr Kay's personal Facebook page referred to the cremation of a body containing metal bone joints. 'I think I have just cremated either wolverine or a terminator. Definitely more metal joints than bone,' it said.

Another post refers to the council's plan to raise cremation fees. 'I really think they could have picked a better number than £666.'

In other posts Mr Kay appears to joke about breaking a rib 'laughing at a funeral,' and burning himself on a 'false knee.'

'At least when I burn myself at work, it's always an interesting shape' said one post, 'so, today's mark is brought to you by the bone insertion tip of a titanium hip joint.'

Upsetting: One of the tasteless posts on Mr Kay's Facebook page included a photo of crematorium equipment hung with Christmas tinsel

Sickening: In one post, allegedly written by Mr Kay, he jokes about burning himself on a 'titanium hip joint' from a cremated body

Other comments posted on his page included a joke about not having to 'hide any bodies today,' and the suggestion that there is 'nothing like listening to 70s disco music when you're cremating.'

'I'm going to do some cooking today,' said a post.

After Mr Kay had uploaded a picture of tinsel around the operating buttons at the crematorium, he posted, 'Hurrah it took me ages to put up the Christmas decorations at work today.'

In an equally tasteless response a friend posted underneath: 'Just toss an extra ... log on the fire if you want to create a more festive air.'

Newcastle City Council has now confirmed that Mr Kay has been suspended. A spokeswoman for the council said: 'We can confirm that the council on Friday suspended an employee as a result of these allegations.

'A formal investigation into the matter has now commenced.'

Another posting on his page said he had 'broke a rib laughing' at the funeral of a grandfather
