The Brit star, 45, and Neville, 51, could not hide their affection for each other as they attended the Thomas Wylde show last Wednesday, cuddled up together and holding hands.

While Minnie has a six-year-old son Henry with former boyfriend, television writer Timothy J Lea.

Minnie made mention of her Neville's son in a tweet last week, writing: 'Text from boyfriend's son renews humor after grumpy afternoon.'

However, Brit-born Neville, who lives in Manhattan near his ex-wife and children, did not accompany Minnie to the glittering Vanity Fair Oscars bash in LA on Sunday night, where she was joined by her friend Kevin Kollenda, who runs new media company Two Hustlers.

In February 2012, she joked about her love life as she told The Guardian: 'There was one time I realised I'd s****ed a whole billboard! My sister pointed it out when we were driving past and we laughed so hard. But oh, that's so… I'm being so naughty.'
