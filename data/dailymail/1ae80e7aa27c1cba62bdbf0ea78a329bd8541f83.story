When teenage mother Shannon Skinner fell pregnant for a second time, she agonised before deciding to have an abortion.

But three months later, while still grieving for her unborn child, she was astonished to be told she was still pregnant.

Now Miss Skinner, 19, says she is delighted to be five months pregnant and is looking forward to the birth of her second daughter in early May.

Shannon Skinner, 19, had an abortion when she was eight weeks pregnant after she, and partner Anthony, decided it was too soon to have a second child - they also have a nine-month-old baby

She
 went for a medical abortion at eight weeks because she thought it was 
too soon to have a second child – she and her partner Anthony Hunt 
already have Lacie, now nine months old.

Miss Skinner, from Bristol, went to a Marie Stopes clinic for the procedure, which involves taking two separate doses of drugs.

But unknown to her and the clinic, the procedure failed – a rare occurrence.

Medical abortion is available to women within the first nine weeks of pregnancy.

It involves taking two sets of pills over two visits to a clinic.

The woman usually experiences discomfort and heavy bleeding after taking the pills.

This normally lasts for a few days until the pregnancy has passed.

The
 abortion starts within four to five hours of taking the second set of 
tablets and is usually completed within one to two days.

Some
 women are not able to have a medical abortion, including those who are 
over 35 and smoke heavily, those who have a suspected ectopic pregnancy 
and those with heart disease.

Medical abortions fail to work in about two to three per cent of cases.

A spokeswoman for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service told MailOnline: 'There is a small risk of your pregnancy continuing with early medical abortion.

'Good follow-up care is important, and any symptoms of ongoing pregnancy should be investigated.

'The
 medication used has been associated with an increased risk of birth 
defects but that does not mean women in this rare situation cannot go on
 to have a healthy baby, and scans should provide reassurance.'

When
 she continued to suffer morning sickness and said she could feel 
movements in her womb, she was given a pregnancy test to do at home, 
which was positive.

But 
when she returned to her doctor another test was negative and she was 
told her symptoms were side effects as a result of the abortion.

Miss Skinner continued to feel poorly and kept complaining – until tests finally revealed she was pregnant.

She was told she must have become pregnant again after the abortion.

But further tests showed her unborn daughter had survived the induced miscarriage.

The couple said they had been using contraception when Miss Skinner fell pregnant.

‘We thought she had gone. I had grieved for that baby and we’d just managed to get our heads around it,’ Miss Skinner said.

‘Anthony and I felt like we’d made the right decision because we were 
having problems and we didn’t think it was right to bring a baby into 
that.

‘I’d always been one of those people that was against abortions and hated them, but I was suffering with postnatal depression.

‘Lacie
 was just four months old at the time, so I had to do what I thought was
 best. But it was not an easy decision and I regretted it straight 
away.’

Miss Skinner and Mr 
Hunt, a head chef at a restaurant, have been told that a medical 
abortion fails to work in only around one case in 30.

They
 are still inside the legal 24-week limit for a surgical termination but
 Miss Skinner said: ‘She’s obviously a little fighter, and we don’t want
 to cause it any more harm.

‘When I had the abortion it didn’t feel the same as it does now – we have seen her and she has a heartbeat.’

Miss
 Skinner had her latest scan last week. Midwives confirmed her unborn 
daughter looks physically fine, however they could not rule out future 
complications.

A midwife at
 St Michael’s Hospital, Bristol, where Miss Skinner is receiving 
check-ups, is investigating what happened, and the couple have also 
complained to Marie Stopes International.

A spokesman for the family planning organisation said: ‘Very occasionally, the medical abortion pill can fail.

'Cases like this are few and far between but of course that does not make the situation any the  less upsetting.’

After the abortion, Ms Skinner continued to suffer morning sickness and to feel movements in her womb. She has just been told she is five months pregnant and that the abortion failed to work

Ms Skinner and Mr Hunt have now decided to keep the baby. It is not believed that she has suffered any ill effects as a result of the abortion drugs

A spokeswoman for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service told MailOnline: 'There is a small risk of your pregnancy continuing with early medical abortion.

'Good follow-up care is important, and any symptoms of ongoing pregnancy should be investigated.

'The medication used has been associated with an increased risk of birth defects but that does not mean women in this rare situation cannot go on to have a healthy baby, and scans should provide reassurance.'
