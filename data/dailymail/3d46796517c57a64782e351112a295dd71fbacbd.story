Fans across the world began queuing for the devices before they were even unveiled.

In Tokyo and Sydney, groups are camped outside, while in London, tents are already positioned outside the Apple Store on Regent Street.

A handful of fans have been queuing outside the firm's Fifth Avenue store since 1 September, when the phones were still a rumour. 

One couple - Moon Ray, 25 and Jason, 29- were among seven people in new York queuing up a week ago.

They travelled over 1,000 miles (1,609km) from Jackson, Mississippi and arrived in New York on September 1 to find that they were not first in the queue, because cousins and New Yorkers Joseph Cruz and Brian Ceballo had beaten them to it.

The Mississippi couple paid $2,500 (£1,500) to swap places with the cousins.

Zoltan Wiettchen, 24, is the first in line in London after staking a place at 9pm on Monday night.

Mr Wiettchen, a Hungarian national who has been in this country for two years, said he is not planning on buying one of the handsets, but rather in the money he can make from queuing up.
