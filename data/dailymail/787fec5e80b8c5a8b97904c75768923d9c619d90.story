IVF patients could save thousands of dollars after a new health clinic agreed to cut out-of-pocket expenses by bulk-billing the majority of services involved with the fertility treatment.Â 

The bulk-bill clinic, which has already had 300 inquiries, will cut prices for IVF treatment to an estimated $500, compared to roughly $4,000 in private health clinics.

Primary Health Care, an Australian medical health centre provider, will open the IVF clinic in Sydney's CBD on Monday.

A new health clinic in Sydney has agreed to cut out-of-pocket expenses for IVF patients by bulk-billing the majority of services involved with the fertility treatment

Average costs for IVF treatment are about $8,000 with Medicare - Australia's public health care scheme - covering between $3,000 to $4,000, the Daily Telegraph reports.

IVF patients at the clinic would still have to cover those services not included in Medicare bulk-billing, like day surgery and embryo freezing.

The clinic's provider is big enough to absorb the extra costs and offer bulk-billing for IVF treatments, according to its chief executive Dr Edmund Bateman.

The bulk-bill clinic, which has already had 300 inquiries, will cut prices for IVF treatment to an estimated $500, compared to roughly $4,000 in private health clinics

'If the medical procedure has an (medicare) item number we will bulk-bill it and you pay nothing for it,' Dr Bateman told the newspaper.

He said the Primary IVF clinic on George Street, Sydney had the resources to carry out 5,000 cycles per year but could double that figure if demand for IVF treatment was greater.
