Disgraced former NRL star Todd Carney has been partying with convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby and her sister Michelle in Bali, a photo posted on social media shows.

In the snap, the sacked Cronulla Sharks player has his tattooed arms draped over the sisters' shoulders and a big smile on his face.

Corby, 37, was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of cannabis to Indonesia.

And 29-year-old Carney has escaped Australia after his 'bubbling' scandal, which showed the sportsman urinating into his own mouth in a lewd photograph taken in a hotel toilet.

The 'bubbling' photo was and leaked on social media and led to him being sacked from his team.

Corby lives with her sister in Kuta, Bali, where Carney is currently holidaying.

Just three months after being released from jail she got back together with her Indonesian boyfriend Ben Panangian, who supported her while she was locked-up.

It's believed she now works at her sister's surfboard and swimwear shop on the island.

On 16 July, Carney first graced his social media accounts since his spectacular exit from the sport.

He was all smiles with former Cronulla Sharks teammate Wade Graham, as the pair caught up mid-week for a sweet treat.

He captioned a photo: 'Always good company and laugh with this frick @wadegraham17 #waffles #yogurberry,'

Fans were supportive of Carney's return to social media, sending him well wishes, with one saying: 'Good on ya @tcarney86 bounce back bigger and better,' while another posed the question on everyone's lips: 'What are u going to do now after that thing u did @tcarney86.'

Carney's sacking followed years of controversy including run-ins with police and NRL officials.

In 2009, a full-frontal naked photo of Carney appeared on a rental phone in Canberra.

The telephone company apologised after a woman found the images on a phone she was loaned by a Telstra Shop while her handset was being repaired.

In 2006, while playing with the Canberra Raiders, he was charged with drink driving and lost his license for five years. He was later caught driving while disqualified and failed to stop for police, which resulted in his being sentenced to community service.

He allegedly urinated on a man in a Canberra nightclub in 2008.

Later that year he was de-registered and banned from playing in the NRL competition until 2010 due to his on-going string of alcohol-related incidents.
