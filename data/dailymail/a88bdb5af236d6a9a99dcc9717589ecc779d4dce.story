A ‘British jobs for British workers’ row erupted yesterday as it emerged that a new £1billion wind farm off the Lincolnshire coast is being maintained by teams of workers flown in from Scandinavia.

As he officially opened the offshore scheme yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg claimed 30,000 British jobs would be created by the end of the decade by investing in renewable energy.

But local MPs and businessmen said this appeared a hollow promise.

Because turbines for the Centrica scheme off Skegness are made in Denmark, Danish and Swedish workers are being drafted in daily to work on them.

Scandinavian Airlines will even begin a six-days-a-week service between Copenhagen and Humberside Airport in October to keep up with demand.

The whole construction of the wind farm was largely foreign, with a French company making the cabling in Germany and Norway and the foundations being manufactured  in Holland.

Sam Pick, who runs a renewable energy consultancy, said Britain was in the ‘craziest possible situation’ where the Government was ‘subsidising development to a huge degree but doing absolutely nothing to either guarantee or support UK content’ in offshore wind farms. ‘There are turbines out there in the North Sea which have not touched UK mainland,’ he said.

Labour MP Nic Dakin warned that if  the industry did not train British people to service and maintain the turbines, there  was little prospect of any domestic jobs premium from the so-called ‘Green revolution’.

Announcing £66million of fresh Government funding for the offshore wind industry, Mr Clegg said the investment would help to make the UK a ‘world leader’ in the sector and create an employment boom, contributing £7billion to the economy.

He compared climate change sceptics who oppose wind farms and other renewable energy developments to the Luddites who smashed machinery during the Industrial Revolution.

‘I think this industry will get bigger and bigger year in year out, which means more jobs in the local area. I know there are many local concerns that the focal work on these wind farms is performed by those flown from elsewhere, yet there are promising signs,’ said Mr Clegg.

‘As a Government we’ve announced an offshore wind strategy that should lead to 30,000 British jobs being created by the end of this decade and we are working with the industry to make sure that the British supply chain are given a fair crack of the whip in the future.’

Mr Clegg hopes the industry will more than quadruple in size by 2020 – at the highest end of government predictions – with half the production coming from domestic firms. But his claims were dismissed by industry experts, who said the targets and job creation predictions were hopelessly optimistic.

They say unless major companies can be persuaded to manufacture wind turbines in the UK, wind farms will continue to be built, but few jobs will go to British workers.

Mr Pick said: ‘If the Government 
doesn’t succeed in bringing wind farm manufacturing to the UK in the 
near future then we will miss out on the tens of thousands of jobs that 
have been promised and they will go to mainland Europe instead.’

Mr
 Dakin, MP for Scunthorpe, said: ‘If we do not act now, we will be in 
the same position by 2020 and will have to import skills and expertise 
while our own school leavers and young adults continue to languish in 
unemployment.’

Humberside has a history of industrial unrest over foreign workers ‘taking British jobs’.

Workers at the Lindsey Oil Refinery at Immingham, North Lincolnshire, staged unofficial strikes and mass protests four years ago because 400 Italian and Portuguese workers were being brought in to work on a major construction project.

Giant floating barges were being used to house the hundreds of foreign workers who were involved in building a de-sulphurisation unit at the Total refinery.

The £300million contract was put out to tender and won by an Italian firm which angered unions by bringing in Europeans rather than hiring locals in an area of high unemployment.

A mass walkout by workers at the Lindsey refinery led to copycat action across the UK.

Employees at power stations  and refineries across the  country held ‘sympathy’ walkouts in protest at the use of  foreign workers.

A deal was eventually struck to give some new jobs to British workers, although no foreign employees at the Total refinery lost their jobs.

The Institute
 for Public Policy Research, a leading think-tank, also found Mr Clegg’s
 claims were optimistic and said greater certainty was needed to attract
 investment.

Generous 
taxpayer-funded subsidies for wind farms are set to continue until the 
end of the decade, but foreign energy firms want a longer-term 
commitment.

Proposals for a new Siemens wind turbine factory in Hull were given planning permission in May last year.

But the German firm wants more concrete promises before it goes ahead with the £80million factory, which would create 700 direct jobs and thousands in the supply chain.

Ministers have promised guaranteed prices – fixed at up to triple the market rate – for electricity from offshore wind until 2019.

They say the financial incentive will make Britain an attractive place to invest and transform our energy supply, but the difference between the wholesale price and the agreed rate will have to be met by consumers.

Dr John Constable, of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a UK charity publishing data on the energy sector, said: ‘Even if the Government’s optimistic assumptions are right, the fact is that wind jobs are soft jobs and dependent on subsidies that increase energy costs and destroy jobs in real businesses.

‘We can’t be sure that the wind jobs will be in the UK, but there is no doubt at all that the jobs lost through high energy costs really will be British.’

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: ‘Local people can absolutely benefit from the workers who come from abroad.

We want to have a lot more British jobs in the industry, that is why we are publishing the industrial strategy. We want to make sure we get the jobs in the supply chain.

‘At the moment because we are coming from a small base it hasn’t been, but we believe the potential here is huge.’

Councils across the UK have spent more than £7.2million on charging points for electric cars over the past three years yet many are not being used.

One in six councils had at least one point not used at all over the past year, and less than a third of authorities had a charging point being used on average more than once a week, figures obtained by the BBC revealed.
