A paratrooper was sucked out of a plane thousands of feet in the air after his reserve parachute was accidentally opened.

Footage has emerged of the U.S. paratrooper kneeling on the open ramp when he is suddenly pulled from the back of the plane.

Amazingly, the man landed safely and was not injured.

It is not clear when the video was filmed but it has gone viral and appeared on news channels around the world.

The paratrooper, the plane's jumpmaster, was sitting on the ramp looking for the drop zone while another soldier stood behind me.

Suddenly, his rip cord is triggered and the reserve parachute opens and immediately sucks him out of the plane.

He managed to control the parachute in the air and landed safety about 50km from the intended drop zone.

The reserve parachute is triggered and begins to open, seemingly without the paratrooper realising

The aircraft is believed to be a C-130 Hercules, which is used for military transport.

A spokesman for the 5th Special Forces Group told Australia's 9 News that the soldier was not hurt when he landed.

The regiment is based in Kentucky.
