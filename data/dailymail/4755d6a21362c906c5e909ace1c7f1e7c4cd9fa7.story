Going back to school has never been so luxurious as a first home buyer snaps up a converted old classroom in South Melbourne for $1.28 million on Saturday.

The tri-level, three-bedroom, four-bathroom apartment is spread more than 200 square metres and is nestled behind the walls of the former Dorcas Street Primary School which was built in 1880.

The New York-style loft at 13/284 Dorcas Street includes a marble open fire, a Juliette balcony and each large bedroom has an ensuite - one with a sauna and another with sunken spa.

The apartment is just one of the converted classrooms in the heritage-listed building which was originally constructed from a design by architect Charles Webb, as a result of winning a competition, with the intention to accommodate more than 1000 students.

Only minor additions were made to the rear of the building to provide a caretaker's residence, cloak room and store in 1924 until the school closed at the end of the school year in 1996.

The building is historically important as a representative example of the first group of large schools constructed in Victoria after the Education Act of 1872.

The expansion of Victoria's education system put tremendous pressure on authorities who had to cater for a very large number of children. As a result of this development, there was an enormous increase in the number of schools constructed between 1874 and 1875.

This move illustrated Victoria's confidence and prosperity in the years following the goldrushes when working class children of the inner suburbs were provided with elaborately designed and spacious schools, similar to private schools built for the wealthy.

The converted classroom located at 13/284 Dorcas Street in South Melbourne went to a first home buyer for $1.285 million on Saturday
