A ‘cheeky’ 12-year-old died after accidentally hanging himself off his bunk bed while ‘mucking about’, a coroner has ruled.

Kyle Darker, from Eccles, Salford, was found dead in his room by his mother Lorraine while he was temporarily excluded from school.

Police who investigated the death could find no evidence that Kyle had been bullied or faced significant difficulties at St Patrick’s RC School in Eccles.

Tragic: Kyle Darker accidentally hanged himself from his bunk bed after he was told to tidy his room

Bolton Coroners’ Court heard how Kyle was a ‘mischievous, interesting boy, liked by his friends and who amused his friends’.

Deputy headteacher Rachel Well revealed how Kyle had been suspended after a classroom prank.

Although Ms Well said Kyle’s behaviour could be ‘disruptive’, she described him as ‘full of life, a really bright young man’.

She said: 'He was full of fun and sometimes that fun got him into a bit of trouble.'

Mucking about: Kyle was rushed to Salford Royal A&E where doctors could not resuscitate him 

The inquest heard how on April 1,  mother Lorraine asked Kyle to clean his room before she went out. 

The last thing Kyle said to her when she asked him if he wanted to come to the shop was: 'No, but get me some crisps.'

When Lorraine, a student, arrived home she found Kyle hanging off his bed with a bag he used to keep his glasses and phone in overnight. 

'He was prone to pranks, he was prone to surprises. I believe that on this occasion it was a situation of mucking about'

Coroner Alan Walsh

He was rushed to Salford Royal A&E where doctors could not resuscitate him.

Although the bag’s thin cord had become wrapped around Kyle’s neck, doctors found no deep marks or signs of trauma on the youngster’s body.

Pathologist Dr Gordon Armstrong said Kyle, who was described as small for his age, died after his airways became trapped, but marks found on his body were consistent with an active ‘12-year-old who played with scooters’.

A police investigation later ruled out any bullying rumours at the school.

The inquest heard how Kyle was prone to playing pranks and had previously climbed through a window and onto a roof.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Alan Walsh said there was enough evidence to suggest a tragic mishap by Kyle.

He said: 'He was prone to pranks, he was
 prone to surprises. I believe that on this occasion it was a situation 
of mucking about.'

In a statement read out in court, mother Lorraine said: 'Unless you lose a child in these circumstances, no one can understand the pain.'

It added: 'My beautiful baby, I can hardly breathe without you here, we miss you every second.

'Kyle, you don’t know the gap that you have left in my life. You were the sweetest kid and everyone loves you so much.

'We don’t know how we will carry on without you. We love you beyond words, why oh why?

'My poor baby, sweet dreams. You have a big family to look after you in heaven so you won’t be alone. Our hearts are completely broken without you.'
