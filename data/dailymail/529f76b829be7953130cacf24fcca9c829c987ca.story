It has been revealed that Ronald Reagan secretly feared his son was gay when the younger Ron dropped out of Yale in 1976 to become a ballet dancer.

Novelist Christopher Buckley, whose father William F Buckley was close with the 40th president, revealed Reagan's fears in a recent Q&A published by the Lincoln Center Theater program.

'My father and Reagan were close, and my dad had always acted as a kind of godfather to the Reagan children, so Reagan called up my dad and expressed to him his worry that this meant that his son played for the other team,' Buckley said.

'My dad ventured the opinion that all people in the arts might not be gay, but there wasn’t much he could really say about this, and, of course, we now know Ron’s not gay.'

Ron Reagan, 56, has been married to clinical psychologist Dora Palmieri for more than thirty years, and they live in Seattle with their cats.

The two eloped in 1980, twenty days after Reagan was elected president, since Mr and Mrs Reagan didn't approve of the relationship.

Over the years, their feelings toward Doria warmed, but initially they questioned her intentions since she was seven years Ron's senior.

Before his marriage, Ron's sexuality was a large question mark and one the former president's critics used against him during his time in office.

The Reagan administration was blamed for their slow response to the AIDs epidemic, which painted the president as homophobic since many believed his son was a closeted gay man.

But Ron has always dealt with the rumors in good humor.

'I'm gay and I'm rich,' Ron joked to the Seattle Times in an 2011 interview. 'Ron Reagan - rich gay man unaccountably married to the same woman for 30 years.'

The younger Reagan was lauded for his dancing skills, and performed with the world-renowned Joffrey Ballet.
