Jasmine Lapsley, six, choked to death on a grape after paramedics took at least 30 minutes to arrive at the house in North Wales

The parents of a six-year-old girl who choked to death on a grape have slammed ambulance services for taking 30 minutes to reach them.

Jasmine Lapsley was playing cards  on a family holiday in Morfa Nefyn, North Wales, when she started choking on her food.

Her parents Robert and Kathleen Lapsley dialled 999 immediately and tried to dislodge the grape - but claim they were left waiting for half an hour before paramedics arrived.

Two community first responders reached the house after 16 minutes, but Jasmine's parents claim these volunteers were unable to help.

Mrs Lapsley said: 'She was sitting down at the table, behaving and playing cards. She turned around and I could see that she was choking.

'I'd just given her the grapes and she was choking on a grape, I was in no doubt about what it was.' 

An RAF rescue helicopter, from Prince William's former HQ in Anglesey, flew her 20 miles to Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital.

When her parents arrived they were told their daughter still had a pulse - but their hopes were dashed when medics said there was no chance of survival.

Mr Lapsley said: 'It took them half an hour to get an appropriate response there.

'The first responders were unable to help. It wouldn't have mattered if they had taken five minutes, 10 minutes or 25 minutes.

'It wasn't what she needed. She needed the paramedic - and it took them half an hour to get that paramedic to us.' 

Three months on, her parents say they're finding it very difficult to continue without Jasmine.

Her mother said: 'When you open your eyes every morning, it's just there. This nightmare's just there. And we have to live with that now for the rest of our lives.

'She was always what we've wanted. She's not here any more.'

Chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust Tracy Myhill said she had 'unreservedly apologised' to the Lapsleys for the trauma they had suffered.

But the Lapsleys said they have had not heard from the trust or received an apology.

A spokesperson for the Welsh Ambulance Trust said: 'We do not routinely make direct contact with bereaved families but will try to maintain lines of communications so when families are at a point where they wish to contact the Trust, we can and will act promptly.

'The Trust has reported this tragic incident to the Welsh Government as a Serious Adverse Incident.

'These reports require a comprehensive and detailed investigation, and the Trust endeavours to complete the investigation by mid to late November.'

A full inquiry into the service is expected to be completed this month - and an inquest into Jasmine's death is expected to take place before the end of the year.
