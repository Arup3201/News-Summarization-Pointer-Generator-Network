Splinters are not something you need to worry about when you're riding a Harley Davidson. 

But they could be an issue for Hungarian Istvan Puskas, who has wowed his fellow countrymen with his latest custom-built ride - a wooden motorcycle.

The three-seater is constructed entirely from pine, with handlebars made from the horns of Hungarian Grey Cattle.

'People will stare at the bike, check out its special details and take photographs of it,' said Istvan, who comes from the village of Tiszaörs.

'I noticed that everyone loves it and they are happy to see this bike - this makes me happy as well.

'When I say everyone, I literally mean everyone loves this bike - from the young ones to the elderly.' 

The 52-year-old, a tractor driver at a nearby agricultural firm, has been using his extreme wood-whittling skills to create vehicles for the last decade.

After honing his skills with three wooden pushbikes, the craftsman tried his hand at a chopper, but the bike fell flat due to the puny 50cc engine it had installed.

But refusing to be daunted, Istvan went on to create a wooden motorcycle with a 200cc engine and a fully-functioning wooden car.

His latest masterpiece took six months to build, with many of Istvan's friends donating spare parts to the cause

And after clocking a beautiful custom-built three-seater at a motorcycle show last year, Istvan resolved to make his own - except made only from wood.

The Hungarian began working on the bike's wooden wheels, which consist of 36 individual pieces screwed and glued together, in November 2013 and finished on May 1 this year.

And despite the incredible level of craftsmanship, the bike was designed with reliability rather than speed in mind, meaning it has a top speed of only 12m/h.

Not that Istvan minds when he's out on the road.

'The feeling that I get from the bike when I take it out for a ride is just perfect,' Istvan said.

'I know that it's not fast, but I can truly say that I have built this myself.'

And while Istvan is proud of his handiwork, he admits that he would be tempted to part with his creation if he received the right offer - although he is struggling to put a figure on bike.

'Even though I do love my bike, I would still love to sell it to someone,' he added.

'At the moment the bike always stays under the open sky as I don't have a garage in our yard.

'I would like to sell it or exchange it for something useful around our house, maybe for some heavy duty tools, something white machinery or anything like that.

'Or, best of all, I'd like to sell it to someone who appreciates my skills and the hard-earned product of that.

'The bike would probably be up for sale for around £3000, but it may be more or may be less. It's impossible to put a figure on it.'
