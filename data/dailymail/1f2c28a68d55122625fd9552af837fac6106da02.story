The future of TLC's surprise hit reality series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo hangs in the balance after it was reported that 'Mama June' Shannon is dating a child sex offender.

And in an effort to set the record straight Mama June took to her daughter Honey Boo Boo's Facebook page with a message for her fans.

The 35-year-old wrote: 'I want to make a post trying to clear up the rumors remember you can't believe everything you read!'

'Ppl sell stories to the tabloid everyday that r false!' She continued. 'It isnt true i promise my kids r #1 priority over anything else and I would never put them in danger period over this or anything else they r my life this is my past I left him 10 yrs ago for it and I wouldn't go back'.

'You Can't believe everything you read': Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star Mama June Shannon is reportedly dating convicted sex offender Mark McDaniel - allegedly pictured here in a hotel room last month

And her 14-year-old daughter Lauryn Shannon - otherwise known as Pumpkin - has spoken to RadarOnline about her mom's prior relationship with Mark McDaniel in a bid to douse the flames.

'The story is not true. My mom left Mark 10 years ago,' the teenager insists, adding: 'They haven’t seen nor talked [to each other] in 10 years.'

While TMZ has obtained a photo allegedly taken a month ago of the 34-year-old reality star snuggling up to the 53-year-old in a hotel bed, Pumpkin has slammed the evidence as simply 'Photoshopped'.

Hitting back: The star has come out to defend herself

With Mama June having separated from long-time partner Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson just last month after she allegedly discovered the 42-year-old actively trolling for women on various dating websites, her daughter says the mom-of-four is enjoying the single life.

'She is all about the kids. She only needs us girls, no-one else,' Pumpkin states. 'We are all sticking together as one happy family with us four girls.'

The matriarch is also mom to Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, nine, Jessica 'Chubs' Shannon, 17, and Anna 'Chickadee' Shannon Cardwell, 20.

'She is all about the kids': Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14 - seen here in March 2013 - insists her mom and her ex 'haven't seen nor talked [to each other] in 10 years' and the recently separated star is enjoying the single life since splitting from long-time partner Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson last month

The three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying baby daddy Michael Cardwell.

According to reports confirmed by the MailOnline, Mark McDaniel is a registered sex offender in the reality show's home state of Georgia.

The registry details that Mark only got out of prison in March after he was convicted in 2004 of aggravated child molestation, which is 'when such person commits an offense of child molestation which act physically injures the child or involves an act of sodomy'.

TMZ reports that Mama June has been dating her ex for the last few months, citing the aforementioned photo as proof of their liaisons.

Just released: Mark was released from prison last month after being jailed for 10 years for molesting an unnamed eight-year-old relative of then-girlfriend Mama June's

The pair were also said to be romantically involved at the time of his arrest.

Horrifyingly, TMZ claims that McDaniel was convicted of assault one of June's own relatives.

The website reports: 'Prosecutors say he molested an eight-year-old child - forcing oral sex.

'We're told Honey Boo Boo's mom has been seeing McDaniel for the last few months ... sneaking away from production of the show and meeting up with him. We're told she's also been setting him up by buying him various gifts.'

In light of the revelations, TLC said it is now examining whether the show will continue.

Serious charge: The 53-year-old - pictured here in a mug shot believed to be from his original arrest - was convicted of aggravated child molestation reportedly perpetrated against an eight-year-old

Registered: McDaniel's crime is public record on the Georgian sex offender registry, as part of his release requires him to keep authorities constantly updated on his whereabouts

A representative told the MailOnline: 'TLC is not currently in production on Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. We are very concerned about this new information and are reassessing the future of the series.'

TMZ contacted Mama June for comment but has yet to receive a response.

The reality star does have a history of dating convicted criminals - including estranged partner Sugar Bear, who is the father of her youngest daughter and show star Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson.

In 1998, he was sentenced to five years in the nearby Montgomery Prison for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper.

In doubt: The future of Mama June's show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo - which stars her youngest daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson - is now being reassessed

Recent split: Last month, the reality matriarch and her partner on nine years, David Michael 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, revealed they had separated. The couple shared a televised commitment ceremony last year

The couple - who had a televised commitment ceremony last year after nine years together - only announced their split last month, but it is understood Mama June may have already been dating Mark at the time.

Tragically, this is not the only sex offender that Mama June has been linked to.

The father of Honey Boo Boo’s 17-year-old sister Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon, Michael Anthony Ford, 37, who dated her mother just a few months before she became pregnant, is currently behind bars.

Criminal past: In 1998, Sugar Bear was sentenced to five years in the nearby Montgomery Prison for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper

In 2008, he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet due to an offence committed in 2005.

According to prison documents, he was charged with two more counts of sexual exploration of a child, also steaming from 2005, and is currently serving 10 years for each charge. He is not expected to be released until 2026.

Here Comes Honey Boo Boo first aired in 2012 and was a spin-off from TLC's Toddlers And Tiaras.

The show aired its fourth season finale in August and, prior to the controversy, there had been no announcement on whether it would be renewed.
