Floyd Mayweather Jnr has named May 2 as the date for his shotgun wedding with Manny Pacquiao.

Speculation that the richest fight in boxing history is close to being made has been rife since the Pacman put on an impressive performance to defeat Chris Algieri in Macau two weeks ago.

Now Mayweather, put under pressure by one of his promotion companies' events, said: 'Will I fight Pacquiao? Absolutely.'

When asked if it would be his next fight he replied: 'absolutely.' 

Pressed as to when that would be he confirmed the expected date for his next appearance, saying: 'May 2, absolutely'.

The undefeated holder of the mythical title of the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world went on: 'The public want this fight. I want it. the only stumbling block has been Bob Arum (Pacquiao's promoter) but I think both fighters want it. So it's time to get it on.'

Mayweather admitted for the first time that negotiations are underway 'behind the scenes', adding: 'I'm not ducking anyone, so let's get this on.

'Years ago we had problems with random blood and urine testing. I just want to have an even playing field.

'Now he's in a very, very tight situation with his loss to (Juan Manuel) Marquez and his loss to (Timothy) Bradley. His pay-per-view numbers are extremely low, so he's desperate. I wanted that fight a long time ago.' 

The news comes as a blow for Amir Khan (left) who takes on Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on Saturday

For the man who calls himself Money, most of the discussions centre around the split of the biggest purse of all time.

It is estimated that the fight will gross a minimum $300million. Pacquiao has agreed to take the thin end of the 60-40 split, although there are suggestions that Mayweather may demand an even higher percentage if an agreement is to be finalised.

If Arum can pioneer pay-per-view in his new market, China, the revenue could rise to so far as to make this a billion dollar fight.

It is probable that Mayweather will insist on fighting in his adopted hometown of Las Vegas as usual. But Arum has been proposing the erection of a pop-up stadium in the famous Strip with a 50,000 capacity, more than double that of any existing arena in Sin City.

If Mayweather is indeed signalling the advent of the biggest fight of all time it will come as a disappointment for our own Amir Khan, who is hoping that an outstanding performance as well as victory here in Vegas this very Saturday night over Devon Alexander would seal his own long-awaited super-fight with Mayweather.
