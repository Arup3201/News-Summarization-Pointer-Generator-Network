The mother of gang rape victim Jyoti Singh Pandey celebrated the death sentences handed to her daughter's four killers - saying 'she is now at peace'.

Asha Devi watched her daughter suffer for 13 days in hospital from eventually fatal internal injuries after being repeatedly raped on a Delhi bus.

Sitting by the bedside in a hospital in Singapore, Asha, 46, promised her 23-year-old child justice would be served.

Finally, after a fast-tracked trial, all four rapists were sentenced to death at in Delhi on Friday - gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, 
fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26.

Ram Singh, co-accused and 
widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his 
cell in March. He was the brother of convicted Mukesh Singh, who drove the bus during 
the ghastly crime.

A minor who was also accused has been sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution.

The grieving mother told the Sunday Mirror: 'She kept saying her only wish was to see them hanged. I know this result will help her be at peace now.'

'Words cannot explain the horror. She cried every time she talked about it. I will never forget how disgustingly brutal they were.

'I remember trying to make her eat. But she was in so much pain she couldn't even eat a spoonful.

'She kept telling me to sit and hold her hand instead.'

Jyoti, a physiotherapy student, sparked a global debate about mysogyny in India when she was attacked on 16 December last year.

The international attention forced judges to prioritise the case - and the lawyer's association in the district of Saket reportedly refused to defend the accused.

Gripped: The case shook the nation and the world. A lawyer emerged from the final day making a 'victory' sign

In January, Asha revealed that Jyoti wanted her rapists 'burnt alive'.

Father Badri Singh, 53, told the paper he 'felt so relieved' when the judge ruled death by hanging.

He said: 'When the judge announced the death penalty I stared right at these men and I saw the fear of death in their eyes. Two of them were crying even.

'But I wasn't bothered and I had no sympathies for them. I will never forgive or forget what they did to my daughter. They're now paying the true price for what they chose to do that night.'

The couple added that Jyoti was born a fighter, having spent her first month in intensive care. Even when she was in hospital she believed she would battle through, they explained.

Determined to fight for equality between sexes in honour of his daughter, Mr Singh declared her death has been an inspiration for India.

He said: 'I feel her life has been sacrificed to teach the world that rapes and this kind of behaviour cannot go on.'

When the sentence was announced all convicts broke down apart from Akshay Thakur.

Each were ordered to pay 55,000 rupees to the family of their victim.

In his closing speech, Judge Khanna said he could not turn a blind eye to rising cases of sexual assault against 
women.

He said: 'The convicts, in the most 
barbaric manner, pulled out her internal organs with their bare hands and caused her irreparable injuries.

'She and her 
friend were then thrown out of the moving bus in naked condition, 
profusely bleeding, on a cold winter night.

'Their unprovoked crime 
demonstrated exceptional depravity of mind of the convicts.

'The crime of such nature requires exemplary punishment.'
