Barcelona manager Luis Enrique believes Lionel Messi's partnership with Luis Suarez has been crucial in helping the Catalan giants climb to the top of the La Liga table.

Messi and Co capitalised on Real Madrid's surprise defeat at Athletic Bilbao by beating Rayo Vallecano 6-1 to move ahead of their rivals.

Barcelona summer signing Suarez netted a brace while Messi scored a hat-trick to open up a one-point gap over Carlo Ancelotti's side.

Enrique lavished praise on both Messi and Suarez after the final whistle by complementing the attacking duo's chemistry.

'He has an understanding with Messi and Luis is giving us more every time,' Enrique told reporters after the match. 'They have chemistry, and that's good for the team.

'We've earned our place in the table. We told the players there would be no easy ball, no peace. We knew it would be an awkward match.

'The goal is to be there [top] when the season ends. I always say that defeats will keep happening, which is why we must be very careful.

'I don't talk about the others. Every game is difficult. Knowing how to manage it will be key.'
