Some of New York’s most talented subway musicians have made history with the world’s first performance by a ‘wifi orchestra’.

The eclectic musicians united for a live experiment that saw them simultaneously connect to a conductor while performing separately in nine different subway stations on a Sunday morning in September.

Using the underground system’s wifi connection, composer Ljova Zhurbin led the orchestra through a performance of Signal Strength, an original piece he wrote for the landmark concert.

With nearly a dozen laptop computers in front of him, Mr Zhurbin drew curious stares from locals and tourists as he conducted the 11-piece performance from sunny Bryant Park in Manhattan.

The performers – equipped with a variety of instruments, including an accordion, bass guitar, saw and theremin – followed along on smartphones that were linked to a Skype connection.

Commuters dropped change into their cases, seemingly unaware that they were witnessing music history.

A three-minute video, directed by Chris Shimojima, has been viewed nearly 100,000 times since it was uploaded two weeks ago.

Mr Shimojima and his team recruited musicians from all types of backgrounds for the experiment, which was carried out on a Sunday morning as the wifi connection would be stronger.

On his website he wrote: ‘The signal did drop or become uneven at points … but enough takes (about eight) were filmed to work around this. Wifi latency was about a half-second but was removed in editing. A portable audio recorder was placed close to each musician for better quality sound.’

He added: ‘If you happened to walk by one of our musicians, you would not have noticed anything unusual, hearing only that instrument. It was, in fact, only one part out of nine. The musicians, luckily, were not stopped by the NYPD.’
