Thousands of families' holidays are under threat from a strike yesterday by Passport Office staff, the government warned. 

Unions staged walkouts at offices across the country in a dispute over staff shortages which they claim have led to a serious backlog in processing applications this year.

But as social media was flooded with complaints about the walkout, the Home Office warned the industrial action at the height of summer will 'inconvenience' people and 'jeopardise' their holidays.

The Public and Commercial Services (PSC) union said the strike is an attempt to draw attention to staff shortages dating as far back as 2010 as well as inequalities in pay. 

Thousands of people have been forced to pay extra to upgrade passport applications or face cancelling their holiday.

Extra staff have been drafted in to deal with a backlog of 30,000 applications, and Home Secretary Theresa May last month issued an apology to those affected by the delays.

David Cameron has blamed a surge in applications this year, as more people plan foreign holidays as the economy picks up. 

The Passport Office said that it had faced the highest demand for applications in the last 12 years, adding that predictions for the summer surge were 'substantially exceeded'.

HM Passport Office chief executive Paul Pugh said earlier this month that the 775,000 applications received in June 'I think is the highest ever recorded in a single month'. 

The PCS union said the high-profile nature of the recent applications backlog has forced the office to take the issue more seriously.

It pointed to recent figures from immigration minister James Brokenshire which showed staff numbers were down by more than 300 in the past four years.

PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'The staffing crisis in the Passport Office has been obvious for everyone to see and it shouldn't have taken a committee of MPs to force the chief executive to meet us to discuss it.

'We are still a long way off getting a commitment from the agency that it will work with us to put the proper resources in place to ensure these backlogs do not reoccur year after year.'

Mr Serwotka was ridiculed after claiming the strike was designed to ‘help the public’ by alerting management to staff shortages.

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘This holiday-wrecking strike is a disgrace. Ed Miliband must condemn these union bullies, who are intent on causing misery for millions of families. This strike must be immediately called off.’

Other ministers insisted the strike was ‘irresponsible’. But members of the public vented their anger at holidays being threatened by the backlog and the industrial action.

Some who travelled to London from as far as Milton Keynes this morning were being turned away and told to return tomorrow.

Tony Spindler, 40, tried to get a passport for his five-year-old son his passport so they could visit family in Greece. He said: 'It's like an airport departure gate up there when the plane has been delayed for 10 hours.

'Everyone's pulling their teeth out. I heard them say they won't be able to return people's one-day passports.

'We've been told we might get ours back later this afternoon but it doesn't look hopeful.'

Stephanie Dirubo, 27, was hoping to go to Lanzarote tomorrow with her boyfriend but was facing disappointment.

'Our appointment is already four hours late and I spoke to a woman outside who had been told she would not get her one-day passport back.

'If we don't get ours today, we have no insurance and won't be able to get any money back from our holiday.

'I asked the office last week if it was leaving it too late to pick up a passport the day before leaving but they said it was fine. Now I'm in a complete panic.'

Shona Smallman, 61, had her passport stolen and organised an appointment to get a fast-track service before her flight to Spain next week.

'They didn't even tell us about the strike which is really naughty because then you get all the way here and find out you have hours to wait and might even have to come back a different day.

'It's especially unfair at this time of year. I'm really looking forward to going on holiday with my daughter and grandchildren.'

Joey Pettit, 28, lives in Milton Keynes and has been told she must come back to the office in Victoria tomorrow, despite having paid £128 for a one-day service.

'I am going to New Zealand in a week and half and stupidly told them so I will probably get pushed to the back of the queue.

'It looks like they'll try and deal with the people leaving tomorrow first.'

Social media was flooded with complaints from people fearing their holiday plans will be ruined

But with millions of people planning to jet off for their summer holidays in the next few weeks, the government condemned the timing of the strike.

'We are disappointed the PCS leadership has called this strike given that HMPO has been in discussions with the union on their issues of concern,' a Home Office spokesman said.

'Holding a strike at this stage is irresponsible and will only inconvenience our customers and jeopardise their holidays.

'We strongly urge PCS to reconsider this action which is not in the interests of staff or the general public they are dedicated to serving.

'HM Passport Office staff know how important it is to hard-working people and their families to receive their passports in time for their summer holidays. 

'They have shown this through their hard work and commitment during this exceptional period of high demand.'

A PCS spokesman said around 1,600 out of 3,400 staff did not turn up for work, but the Home Office put the figure at 875.

HM Passport Office chief executive Paul Pugh said earlier this month that the 775,000 applications received in June was the highest ever in a single month.

Mr Serwotka was asked on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme if the strike was designed to ‘help the public’ by alerting management to staff shortages. He said ‘absolutely’.

He went on: ‘The staffing crisis in the Passport Office has been obvious for everyone to see.

‘We are still a long way off getting a commitment from the agency that it will work with us to put the proper resources in place to ensure these backlogs do not reoccur year after year.’

The Home Office criticised the union for the strike’s timing.

A spokesman said: ‘We are disappointed the PCS has called this strike given that HMPO has been in discussions with the union on their issues of concern.

‘Holding a strike at this stage is irresponsible and will only inconvenience our customers and jeopardise their holidays.’

Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee said: ‘This action will not help the situation and will inflict more suffering on the public.’
