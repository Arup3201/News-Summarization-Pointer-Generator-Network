A stunning castle nestled in the Scottish highlands is going on sale for a bargain £1.2million - but prospective buyers will have to shell out to complete vital refurbishment.

Carbisdale Castle, near the village of Culrain, boasts 40 bedrooms and was for decades used as a youth hostel which attracted thousands of holidaymakers.

The grand residence - completed in 1917 - sits on a picturesque hillside not far from the Kyle of Sutherland, a body of water famous for its salmon fishing.

Up for sale: Cardisdale Castle, near the Highland village of Culrain, is on the market for £1.2million

Prospective buyers will have to shell out to complete vital refurbishment to the stunning building

Interior: The 40-bedroom castle was finished in 1917 and was once a bustling youth hostel. But it was ravaged by water damage in 2010 and 2011. The statues pictured have now been removed

Prospective guests would have to make their way up a single-track road to reach the castle's stone-built gates and broad courtyards.

Carl Warden, an estate agent with Savills said: 'I've seen a lot of fine buildings in my time, but this one really makes an impression.  The size of it and the detail in some of the rooms just takes your breath away.

'There are six main rooms and the decorations are beautiful. And it's biggest saving grace is that the train stops at the end of the drive. You can walk the half a mile or so from the station.'

Inside, as well the 40 bedrooms, the 
castle boasts a ballroom, a grand hall, a billiards room, a dining room 
and a drawing room - all of which were not harmed by the water damage 
and boast intricate masonry.

The building was once a thriving tourist attraction, which entertained some 20,000 guests a year

The building was once a thriving tourist attraction, which entertained some 20,000 guests a year, but it was forced to close in 2011 after a spate of bad weather and water damage.

A rough winter saw feet of snow pile up on the castle's roof. When the warmer weather returned and the snow and ice melted, it rushed into the house, causing millions of pounds of damage.

The Scottish Youth Hostel Association (SYHA) - which is now trying to sell the property - spent more than £2million attempting to repair the damage.

 have escaped harm

But financial pressures mean that the organisation is looking to dispose of the castle to spend its money elsewhere.

In the wake of the repairs, beds, furniture and the kitchens were all stripped out. But Mr Warden says it would be essential to sell the property to somebody who wished to keep making commercial use out of it.

Remaining repairs and refurbishment are likely to extend into the millions, he told MailOnline, but the castle could once again be viable as a Highlands hotel.

Indeed, a Scottish government body has hinted that it may award a grant to anybody who wishes to pay out for further repairs.

In his statement, SYHA boss Keith Legge said the organisation was selling the castle 'with regret' because it could not find the funding to finish the refurbishment.

Mr Legge said the castle had not generated enough surplus income to allow for reinvestment.

He continued: 'The recent partial refurbishment and ongoing running costs already incurred, coupled with the extensive funds necessary to complete the refurbishment of the castle, makes it financially unsustainable to operate the property as a youth hostel in the long term.

'As a not-for-profit and self funding charitable organisation, SYHA has a duty to make best use of scarce resources.'

In exile: King Haakon VII of Norway, pictured, took refuge in Carbisdale Castle while Hitler was occupying his country

The grand Highland residence was built between 1905 and 1917 for Mary Caroline, Duchess of Sutherland, the second wife of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 3rd Duke of Sutherland.

The two married in 1889, six years after the Duchess’s first husband died in a hunting accident.

But the marriage incensed the Duke’s family – and when he died his heirs contested the will, which left much of the family’s property to the new Duchess. The acrimonious battle saw the Duchess of Sutherland thrown in prison for six weeks for destroying evidence.

As part of the settlement the Duke’s sons were forced to build the Duchess a home – and rumour has it she picked the prominent hillside location to make it as visible as possible to her disgruntled relatives.

In a further twist of the knife, she told the builders to only install clocks on three of the four faces of the castle.

The aspect pointing towards her estranged family in Sutherland has no visible clock – as she didn’t want to give them to time of day.

Carbisdale changed hands in the 1930s when it was bought by a Scottish army colonel with Norwegian ancestry.

He offered his home up as a safe haven to Haakon VII of Norway and Crown Prince Olav – later Olav V – when they were exiled in the Second World War.

From Carbisdale the exiled rulers struck a deal with Stalinist Russia, allowing them to enter the country to rout Hitler’s forces, but demanding that they leave afterwards.

In October 1944 the agreement came true when the Red Army stormed through Norway, but later withdrew and allowed the country to flourish.

After the last remaining owner died in the mid-1940s, at which point it was given to the Scottish Youth Hostels Association, who ran it until its 2011 closure.
