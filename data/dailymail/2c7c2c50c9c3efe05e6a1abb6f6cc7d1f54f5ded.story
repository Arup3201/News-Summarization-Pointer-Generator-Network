Kelsie Elise Frick made sure her name was remembered with the graduation prank

When hundreds of students graduate together it can be easy for your special moment to get lost in the crowd.

So when it was Kelsie Elise Frick's turn to walk on stage, she made sure her name was the one that would not be forgotten.

After making a slight amendment to her phonetically spelled name card, she was announced as Kelsie Elise Frick-en-awesome.

The 23-year-old, who received a Bachelor of Arts in English, said she wanted to 'go out with a bang'.

In a video of the prank at Grand Valley State University in Michigan the audience erupt with laughter and cheers as the student collects her degree raising her fist in celebration.

Luckily for Miss Frick university officials also saw the funny side.

The announcer can be heard giggling off camera and President Thomas Haas turns to the camera and smiles. 

The video of the student on December 8 has already been seen more than 100,000 times online.

Miss Frick, who now plans to become a teacher, told mlive: 'I was going to dance or something but I 
didn’t realise how fast they go through all the names out there.

'It was kind of funny the way (the announcer) said 
it because he kind of realised it halfway through.'

Bob Stoll, associate dean for student
life, said it was perhaps the most unique stunt he had seen in his 30 
years at the university, adding: 'There may have been a girl that did a 
cartwheel about 20 years ago.'

The university saw the funny side and did Frick did not face any repercussions.

Although her mother, who was in the audience, was a little bit shocked.

She sent her daughter a text afterwards that read: 'I can't believe you did that.'
