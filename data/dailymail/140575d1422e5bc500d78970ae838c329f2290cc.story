A teenage school girl has been placed in 'isolation' by her secondary school which has a ban on 'unnatural' hair colours after she dyed her hair red. 

Alana Harrison, 13, has been told by management at King James's school in Huddersfield, west Yorkshire that she will not be allowed into classes until she changes the colour of her hair. 

Her family said that the Year 8 pupil from Kikheaton, west Yorkshire faces a long period away from her classmates because the colour in her hair was permanent.

Alana's mother Mandy said any attempt to change the colour now would cause damage to her daughter's hair. She said the hairdresser even contacted the school to confirm this fact. 

The schools said that the rules are very clear. They are in every student’s planner, tutors regularly remind pupils and a letter was sent home with every pupil in February reminding parents about the rules.

In January pupil Oscar Ward, 16, spent many days in isolation at King James’s when he turned up with a bleach blond Mohican haircut. He has since changed his hairstyle to comply.

Mrs Harrison said: 'Alana had some red put in her hair, it is not bright red. It won’t wash out; it’s permanent - the more she washes it, the brighter it will get.

'Alana is Type 1 diabetic and needs daily injections. I have told the school her blood sugar levels need checking every hour as she is just sitting down all day in isolation and not moving around, which causes her blood sugar levels to go up.

'It’s stressful for both of us as she is not allowed her mobile and I can’t ring her to check her sugars.

'She won’t learn much in isolation, but I have to send her to school or I will be fined. We are at a stalemate as we can’t change the colour of the hair.

'On Monday there was a girl there with purple hair, but she is not in isolation - and the head of year I spoke to on the phone has bleach blond hair.'

Head teacher Robert Lamb said the school rules are very clear about the need for 'a conventional hair colour'

Headteacher Robert Lamb said: 'Our rules on this are very clear and have not changed in the time I have been the headteacher, which is over 12 years. The girl had two older sisters at the school and the rules haven’t changed.

'The section about hair states: "Hair and Make-up: Conventional colour and style. Unnatural colours are not allowed."

'The Student Planner goes on to say: "If any student is not in full school uniform or meeting the expectations of appearance, they will have to rectify the situation before they are given permission to go into lessons."

'All schools have similar rules. The hair rule, like the other school rules, are there to ensure that nothing detracts children from what they are there for, which is to achieve their potential.

'If you break the school rules, you are punished, I don’t know what the story is.'

Mandy Head didn't think there would be a problem when her son Joe said he wanted to go to school at  Pope Paul Catholic Primary School in Potters Bar wearing his hair in a pony tail in the style of Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

But the next day she received a letter telling her that her son's hairstyle was 'unsuitable' and headteacher Helen Lines told her it was 'associated with drug taking.'  

Tom Mosely, left, from Eccles, wanted to have the same haircut as the Manchester City star Aguero, right

Ten-year-old Tom Moseley was told his short back and sides hairstyle, modelled on the Manchester City striker's look, was too extreme by staff St Gilbert's Primary School in Winton, Eccles, and he was removed from school on his birthday.

His family say they were told he could either return to classes when his hair had grown, restyle it or wear a hat at all times.

Meanwhile 14-year-old Jordan Ford was suspended from school after he arrived with a dyed red mohican hairstyle. 

He was sent home from Bridge Learning Campus in Whitchurch, Bristol by staff. 

So the youngster decided to post an old photograph of head teacher Keziah Featherstone he found on Facebook featuring the teacher sporting a bright purple hair cut and pink Dr Martens boots.
