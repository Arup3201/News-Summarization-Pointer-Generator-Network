It is regarded as one of the world's toughest climbs, a 2000-foot rock formation with a vertical face.

But a mountain climber from Cumbria has become the first Briton to conquer the notorious El Capitan in California's Yosemite National Park.

Leo Houlding inched his way up the formation in an agonising climb - pulling himself up by his fingertips using a one-inch vertical crack in the rock face,

Scaling new heights: British climber Leo Houlding clings to the rock face of El Capitan as he makes his historic ascent

On the edge: Leo agonisingly inched his way up the 2,000ft cliff in Yosemite National Park, California

Clinging to ambition: El Capitan is notorious for its slippery granite rock, making it hard for free climbers - who use just their hands and feet - to ascend

Despite being regarded as one of the world's hardest climbs, the 31-year-old conquered the rock formation - and his feat was captured on camera by photographer Alistair Lee.

But
while he was there he was faced with a deluge of rain during a fierce storm, which turned the rock 
face into a waterfall, and ended up having to camp out for 48 hours on a
ledge, narrowly avoiding hypothermia.

It is notorious for its 
slippery granite rock, making it hard for free climbers - who use just 
their hands and feet - to ascend.

It meant he was forced to painfully 
inch his way up a vertical inch-wide crack in the rock face - clinging 
on with his fingertips.

Leo, from the Kendal, Cumbria, said: 'The climb is the wildest and hardest I've ever done by miles.

'If I never climb anything harder, I will not be disappointed.'

He
added: 'When I finally succeeded in getting to the top totally free, I 
was physically and emotionally exhausted - but it was one of the 
proudest moments of my life.

Sheer drop: Despite being regarded as one of the world's hardest climbs, Leo raced up the mountain

All weather: During the challenge, Leo was faced with some of the most severe storms witnessed in the area all year

Between the cracks: The 31-year-old said he felt like he had pushed himself to the very limit - and only just succeeded

He's cracked it: Leo was forced to painfully inch his way up a vertical inch-wide crack in the rock face - clinging on with his fingertips

'I felt like I had pushed myself to my very limit and only just succeeded.'

Incredibly Leo had spent nine years - and almost 60 days - attempting to conquer El Capitan.

However he successfully scaled the Californian mountain becoming the first Brit to do so.

Alongside climbing partner Jason Pickles, Leo was faced with some of the most severe storms witnessed in the area all year.

He added: 'During the climb it rained so bad - it was biblical proportions. The whole wall turned into a waterfall.

'The weather is usually very good in Yosemite but on the final ascent we suffered a very serious storm.

'If I never climb anything harder, I will not be disappointed': Leo said the climb was the wildest and hardest he has ever done

Notorious: The 7,500ft sheer rock face on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park in California

'There was almost 80 hours of rain, spent 100 in our flooded port-a-ledge, shivering.

'If we could have been rescued we would have requested it but it was impossible until the storm passed.

'When the skies returned to blue and the sun came out, we dried ourselves and somehow managed to finish the hardest part of the climb.'

He added: 'Climbing the first ascent on El Cap is the ultimate goal in climbing.

'It is the greatest cliff in the world and the hardest and most dangerous climb I have ever done

'You know the history of modern climbing is written in these routes. And to add my own new route up El Cap to that is putting your name in the history books.'
