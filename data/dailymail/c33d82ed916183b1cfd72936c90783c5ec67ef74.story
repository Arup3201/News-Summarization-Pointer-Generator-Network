Michael Owen believes Mario Balotelli will soften the blow of Daniel Sturridge's injury by reviving Liverpool's season during the hectic Christmas period.

Owen, who himself made over 200 appearances for the Reds in an eight-year spell, admitted that the timing of Sturridge's injury was disappointing, but that Balotelli can be the man to propel Liverpool up the league.

'The timing of Daniel Sturridge's latest muscle injury couldn't be worse for Liverpool with plenty of big games between now and the January transfer window,' Owen wrote on Sportlobster.com.

'The only obvious solution is for Brendan Rodgers to get the most out of Balotelli. He is more than capable and the upcoming fixtures are not the most daunting.

'It's a big opportunity for Super Mario to do the business and I think he will.'

Liverpool go into Sunday's game against Crystal Palace in a disappointing 11th place in the Premier League, looking to win their first match in four.

This fixture will be one of some trepidation for Rodgers' side after they squandered a three-goal lead in the space of 11 minutes in the game last season, swinging the title race in the favour of eventual winners Manchester City.
