Princess Amalia Gabriela Maria Teresa of Nassau, the two-day-old daughter of Prince Felix of Luxembourg made her debut today - wrapped in her parents' arms as they emerged from the hospital where she was born.

The baby, who was born on 15th June, looked less than impressed with the rapturous welcome she received, barely stirring as her parents waved to photographers.

They, by contrast, looked overjoyed with her mother Princess Claire, 29, beaming as she posed for a photo with her newborn daughter.

Equally thrilled was Prince Felix, also 29, the second child of Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa, and second in line to the throne behind his brother, Prince Guillaume.

The pair married in a civil ceremony in her hometown of Frankfurt, Germany on September 13 last year.

Three days later they had a more traditional wedding which included Prince Felix’s parents - the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Luxembourg.

The splendid wedding took place in front of 350 guests at the Basilique Sainte Marie-Madeleine in Saint-Maximin-La-Sainte-Baume.

Thanks: The new parents shook hands with medics as they emerged from the hospital with their daughter

Careful! Princess Claire looked slightly nervous as she carried her baby girl out of the hospital

Princess 
Amalia, her parents' first child, joins a busy royal nursery that 
already contains Prince Gabriel of Nassau and Prince Noah of Nassau - 
the two sons of Prince Felix' younger brother, Prince Louis, 27, and his
 wife Princess Tessy, 28.

And
 the royal brood of Luxemburg looks likely to grow: Prince Guillaume has
 been married to Belgian countess Stéphanie de Lannoy since 2012, while 
Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa have two further 
children.

They are Princess Alexandra of Luxembourg, 23, and Prince Sébastien of Luxembourg, 22.

Adorable: The baby girl slept peacefully in her mother's arms throughout the photo call

Look of love: Prince Felix tenderly patted his newborn daughter on the head as the family left hospital
