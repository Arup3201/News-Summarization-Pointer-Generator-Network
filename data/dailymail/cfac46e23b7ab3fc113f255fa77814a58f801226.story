With items such as venison and wild boar on the menu, you would be forgiven for thinking you were dining at an upscale, five-star restaurant. 

But instead of being helmed by a celebrity chef, all the dishes in The Clink are cooked and served by inmates.

And now the eatery - which is staffed by prisoners at HMP Cardiff - has been recognised as the best place to eat in the city as voted for byTripAdvisor reviewers.

The Clink, which opened in September 2012, has been rated top on TripAdvisor out of 946 restaurants in the capital, after more than 380 satisfied customers left glowing reviews.

One reviewer wrote that the 'friendly and informative staff' put other waiters to shame.

'The standard set by everyone at this venue would be hard to match in any other restaurant we have been to in recent times,' a happy diner wrote on the website. 

Another left a five-star rating with the comment: 'The waiters were great with perfect service - better than we have had in some starred restaurants - and also attentive to your needs.'

About 30 prisoners work a 40-hour week either in the kitchen or restaurant, training towards nationally recognised City & Guilds NVQs before returning to the prison at the end of each working day.

The team of trainers at the restaurant works closely with the prisoners to create seasonal dishes with fresh ingredients that are sourced locally where possible.

Among its typical menu options are 'venison and wild boar ragout with game sausage, chargrilled polenta and seasonal vegetables' and a 'celebration of rhubarb'.
