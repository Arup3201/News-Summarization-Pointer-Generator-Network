One was killed and four others were injured after an explosion at a nuclear plant in one of the France's most popular tourist areas today.

The blast at the vast Marcoule site, close to Bagnols-sur-Ceze, in the Gard department, immediately raised fears of an atomic disaster.

Marcoule, which is used to store and melt down radioactive waste, is close to the beaches of the French Riviera and major cities including Montpellier and Marseilles.

Response: A fire truck arrives at Marcoule nuclear waste treatment centre after the blast. The French nuclear watchdog insists that 'right now, there is no radioactive leak' but the fire service has refused to enter the site

But, following the explosion at around 11.45am, a spokesman for ASN, France's nuclear safety watchdog, claimed 'right now, there no radioactive leak'.

Despite this, the fire service was refusing to enter the facility to assess the damage, and a safety perimeter fence had been placed around the facility.

A source among the workforce at Marcoule, which has been in operation since 1956, said: 'The explosion caused the instant death of one man, while another is in a critical condition with horrific burns.

'He has been transported to hospital 
in Montpellier by emergency helicopter. Another three workers are less 
seriously injured, and they have been evacuated to hospital in 
Bagnols-sur-Ceze.'

Emergency: France's Ecology, Transport and 
Housing Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, centre, arrives on the 
scene at Marcoule after the explosion, which happened at around 11.45 this morning

Marcoule was used to carry out some of the earliest plutonium experiments by French military scientists.

It once housed a number of nuclear reactors, but these have been shut down. Now it contains a pressurized water reactor, with cooling for all its plants coming from the Rhone River.

France produces almost 80 per cent of its electricity from nuclear power - the highest percentage in the world.

EDF (Electricity of France) - the country's main electricity provider - has managed the country's 59 nuclear power plants since 2002, with potentially dangerous incidents kept to a minimum.

Security: French gendarmes secure the area around Marcoule after the explosion. The site was the scene of some of the earliest experiments with plutonium by French weapons scientists

Injuries: Members of a paramedic team and a helicopter are seen at the Marcoule nuclear waste treatment centre. One worker was killed and four others have been injured and airlifted to nearby hospitals

After the Fukushima nuclear accident 
in Japan earlier this year, Prime Minister Francois Fillon called for 
'open and transparent' checks of all nuclear installations.

He
particularly wanted to examine the risks of leaks, floods, earthquakes,
loss of power and cooling, and accident management processes.

Following
the Fukushima disaster, which was directly caused by a Tsunami and 
earthquakes, an OpinonWay poll of March 2011 found that 57 per cent of 
French people were opposed to nuclear energy in France.

Despite
this, Nicolas Sarkozy's government has pledged the country to a nuclear
future, encouraging companies to export nuclear-produced energy to 
countries including Britain.
