Dementia patients will receive a diagnosis within six weeks rather than six months of presenting  symptoms in a radical shake-up of care for the elderly, the Health  Secretary said yesterday.

Jeremy Hunt said people with suspected dementia should not be kept waiting for treatment because of delayed diagnoses.

Mr Hunt pledged that Britain will become a ‘global leader’ in battling the illness under a new system to be introduced by March 2015.

He said too many elderly people suffer ‘stress and anxiety’ because their GPs are not detecting signs of the disease early enough.

‘There are parts of the country where it takes six months to get a dementia diagnosis, which is absolutely scandalous,’ he added. ‘I want to get to a situation where the average across the whole country is no more than six weeks.’

Mr Hunt, who is attending a conference in Paris, said the NHS needs to respond to an increasingly elderly population and should follow the French model of care where family doctors are more likely to detect possible signs of the disease.

In an interview with the Telegraph, the Health Secretary said: ‘How we respond to dementia is the litmus test of whether we can face up to the challenge of an ageing population, and do so in a way which allows compassion and dignity.

‘Dementia can be a horrific and heart-breaking disease, but it is my mission as Health Secretary to make this country the best place in the world to get a dementia diagnosis, as well as a global leader in the fight to find a cure.’

Experts recommend a patient with suspected dementia should wait no more than six weeks for an appointment at a clinic.

Researchers calculated that 44 per cent of Britons with dementia have not yet been diagnosed – equating to 370,000 patients.

Once given a diagnosis, patients can be given drugs such as Aricept which reduce symptoms and also slow the progression.

Yesterday Mr Hunt said late diagnosis could be denying sufferers drugs that could slow down or halt the progression of the illness.

He added: ‘There is still a minority of GPs who don’t think it is worth giving someone a dementia diagnosis. In fact, we know that a timely diagnosis can mean medicines to help stave off the condition in about one in three people and it can also mean putting support and plans in place for families trying to cope with the fact that someone has dementia.’

In January 2013 the Alzheimer’s Society uncovered a ‘postcode lottery’, with a huge variation in the provision of NHS services.

In some trusts, more than two thirds of patients with dementia have not yet been diagnosed.

Figures show that one in three people will develop dementia but Department of Health estimates suggest that just half of the 670,000 people in England suffering from the disease receive a diagnosis.

Tomorrow Mr Hunt will announce that Marks & Spencer, Argos, Homebase and Lloyds Banking Group have committed  to sign up more than 120,000 staff to undergo training to support customers with dementia.
