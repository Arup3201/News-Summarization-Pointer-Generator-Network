NSW Police are no longer investigating claims by a member of the Royal Australian Navy that he was attacked on Thursday morning near his home in Bella Vista, in Sydney's north-west

The alleged attack was reported to have occurred in Bella Vista, in the the city's north-western suburbs

The assault claims follow the largest counter-terrorism raids (above) in the nation's history last week, which involved more than 800 Federal and State police

ADF Commander Mark Binskin has confirmed that the man has withdrawn the claims and he has apologised to the Middle Eastern community.

At a new conference today he said 'on behalf of the Australian Defence Force I would like to apologise to the Australian community and in particular the Middle Eastern community for any angst this has caused'.

But NSW Police have also revealed they are looking into the reasons behind the allegations being brought to them, in the first place.

'We are now investigating why those allegations came to us,' a NSW Police spokeswoman said.

Following two alleged 'incidents' Defence officials advised members of the ADF to use their own judgement when considering going out in uniform.

'ADF members have been advised to consider where they are going, to be aware of their surroundings, and to exercise common-sense and judgement when considering where and when to wear uniform in public,' the statement read. 

Commander Binskin added that it was up to individuals or their commanders to decide if they were their uniforms outside of their base.

'I want people to be aware of their situation and aware of their surroundings,' he said.

On the question of sailors wearing uniforms outside of base, Commander Binskin said he would not be issuing a general command but 'I want people to be aware of their situation and aware of their surroundings'

'They know through common sense where they should wear uniform and where it might not be right.'

A previous earlier attack on a member of the RAN, which is still being investigated, relates to a verbal assault on a sailor in the Sydney CBD.

The complaint which has been withdrawn, was reported to police as having occurred at about 6.30am on Thursday morning a 41-year-old man was allegedly set upon by two men of Middle Eastern appearance in Bella Vista.

He told police he was in full uniform, was on his way to work and had suffered bruising.

The navy member reported the alleged incident to police by phone and then in person at Kings Cross Police Station, which is located near the Navy Base in Garden Island. 

There had been reports that the man even told police his apparent attackers had threatened to cut his throat.

The claims led to a swift response from Muslim community leaders, Dr Jamal Rifi tweeted that such an attack was 'abominable'.  

Chief of the Defence Force Mark Binskin recently decided to raise the alert level at all of the military's bases and establishments.

The decision followed the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) raising the nation's terror alert level to 'high', meaning an attack is likely.

The largest counter-terrorism raids in the nation's history, involving more than 800 police in New South Wales alone, occurred earlier this month.

Now, it's been revealed by NSW Police, that the reported incident in Bella Vista is being investigated on the basis of why they had to throw resources at something 'we believe never actually took place'.
