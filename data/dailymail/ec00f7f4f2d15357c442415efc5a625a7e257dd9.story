Andorra may be one of the cheapest places to go skiing, and ahead of the half-term holidays it may just be the best.

Heavy snowfall around the Pyrenees has left skiing conditions in the European country being described as 'amazing,' and the forecast doesn't look likely to change over the next few days.

In-resort costs have dropped as much as 23 per cent on last year in Andorra, with Soldeu providing the cheapest option for a ski trip, according to the latest stats from Post Office Travel Money.

Heavy snowfall across the Pyrenees will be music to the ears of those planning a ski trip to the region

With much of Europe under a deluge of snow, this opens up some tricky decisions as to which ski resort will offer the best overall deal

It may be good news for skiers, but heavy snow on the Pyrenees has not being met with similar enthusiasm by townsfolk

The Andorran ski resort of Soldeu has seen the biggest slide with a 23 per cent price reduction at resort

This takes into account costs such as equipment, six-day passes, lessons and food and drink.

Around six-and-a-half feet of snow was reported to have fallen in Andorra last week, with ski resorts expecting the conditions to attract a raft of tourists over the holidays.

Once the falling snow ceases, visibility will improve which mean Andorra could be the place to go this ski season. 

Koko Sarkari, from the International Currency Exchange (ICE) told MailOnline Travel: 'When looking at the cost of a ski pass to compare relative costs in popular ski destinations across Europe, those travelling to Andorra will be paying around 45 Euros for an adult compared to 49 Euros in Courcheval in France or 50 Euros in Val d'Isere.

'Eating out isn't too expensive - in Andorra a meal for two in a mid-range restaurant can be had for around 35 Euros, whereas it's a little cheaper in Val d'sere and Courcheval at around 30 Euros**.

'So while ski pass costs are slightly cheaper and meals slightly more expensive than neighbouring ski destinations in France, the real cost benefit of going to Andorra right now is that skiers can capitalise on the weakness of the Euro, which is accepted widely in the country. 

'Last February, £1 bought 1.17 Euros, this year it's around 1.30 offering a saving of around £4 on a ski pass.' 

And France, while generally being at the other end of the cost scale to Andorra, is also likely to be a popular destination, with five feet of snow falling in Avoriaz and Chamonix.

Val d'Isère has been the big winner in France, with the Tarentaise Valley ski resort recording a depth of 5ft 7ins of snow on the upper pistes.

Upper pistes in Serre Chevalier in the French Alps have over 5ft of snow.

After they scrapped the Euro cap on the Swiss Franc, a rise against the Euro has even led to many cancelling prospective ski trips to Switzerland due to fears of escalating prices.

But Verbier offers high thrills to the skier, with the highest pistes holding a 190cm-deep snow base.

With pistes  rising to 3,100m under the Matterhorn, Zermatt is also a popular destination.

And with the heavy snowfall comes the evident cold snap, temperatures around Europe have fallen well below zero, so the advice to skiers would be to wrap up at all times. 

While heavy snowfall in the Pyrenees is good for skiers, getting out there may prove problematic depending on how you travel

Northern Spain has also been hit byheavy snowfall, with the small towns of Roncesvalles and Burguete, in the Pyrenees, buried

Chamonix is also benefitting from heavy snowfall, with over 5ft reported in the last few days meaning joy for those on the slopes

Prices have plunged downhill at ski resorts, offering British winter sports enthusiasts good value for money this year.

Total costs were at their lowest in Bansko in Bulgaria (£261), while other good-value resorts were Kranjska Gora in Slovenia (£300), Ellmau in Austria (£311) and Livigno in Italy (£322).

Priciest of the European resorts surveyed was Zermatt in Switzerland (£687).

For the best family deals, Bansko (£848) remains the cheapest skiing for a family of four. However, Kranjska Gora (£1,110) has lost its runner up position because of a significant 18 per cent price fall in both Soldeu (£982) and Ellmau (£985).
