Travelling solo? Feeling lonely in your hotel? There's an app for that.

HelloTel is a new mobile social  tool that can turn any hotel stay into potential networking opportunity. 

Create a profile by connecting it to your Facebook page and select your hotel to 'check-in.' You'll then have access to a custom social feed of everyone else checked into either your hotel or a hotel nearby. 

Travelling alone? Simply download HelloTel and get connected to fellow hotel guests nearby

To create a profile on HelloTel, simply log-in with your Facebook account. Then, 'check-in' to your hotel online

Sound a bit like Tinder? Well, it sort of is.

But, instead of swiping left or right as you evaluate potential love matches, HelloTel isn't solely focused on providing you with romantic options.

Through the list, you can chat, post photos, update your status and even private message other users, in case you'd like to ask a fellow hotel guest to meet you down at the bar.  

The app allows you to specify if you are in town for 'business' or 'pleasure'

Looking to network with potential clients? Simply select the 'business' option on HelloTel 

However, you'll also have the opportunity to select whether you've checked into the hotel for business purposes or leisure.

This can help customise your HelloTel experience and narrow down whether you're looking to meet with potential clients or a potential date.

On its website, it says: 'HelloTel is a mobile app that turns any hotel check-in into a rich social network. Create a profile automatically by connecting to Facebook or creating your own HelloTel App login. 

Fancy a drink at the bar? Users will also have the option to private message those around them

'We will NEVER publish your data back to Facebook. Populate your profile with a simple touch and check-in to a hotel nearby. Scroll through a custom social feed of everyone else checked into your hotel or nearby.

'Interact, meet new friends, post pictures, and even private message other users.'

One thing's for sure: travelling alone is about to get a lot less lonely.
