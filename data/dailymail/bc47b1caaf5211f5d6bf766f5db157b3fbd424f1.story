A woman has been ordered by a judge to stop renting out rooms in her apartment on a popular rental website.

Noelle Penraat has been renting out rooms in her swank Manhattan apartment, located right on Central Park, on Airbnb.

As a result, the unemployed photographer has been able to make roughly $78,000-a-year and cover her monthly rent of $4,477, this in addition to other bills.

Nice digs: Penraat made $78,000 last year by renting rooms in her Central Park apartment (above)

According to the Daily News, Penraat 'charged $75-$150 a night or $450-$1,000 a week, depending on the size of the bedroom.'

The problem however is that her fellow neighbors at 315 Central Park West were not happy with her arrangement, and it was not legal.

It is illegal to rent out the rooms as that would turn a residential building into a hotel, and health and fire standards are far more strict in the hotel industry as opposed to residential.

Furthermore, the building now wants to evict Penratt as her rent controlled apartment would go for much, much more than she is paying on the open market. 

'She’s making more money by turning this apartment into a bed and breakfast than her landlord is getting in rent,' said Penratt's attorney, Arlene Boop. 

'This is supposed to be her home, not a profit making entity.' 

Penraat's next hearing is scheduled for February.
