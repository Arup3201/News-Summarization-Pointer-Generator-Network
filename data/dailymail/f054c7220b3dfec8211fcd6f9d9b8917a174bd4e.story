Dozens of vulnerable girls were bought and sold for sex by paedophiles running a modern-day slavery ring, police revealed yesterday.

Many of the 24 victims – some as young as 11 – were groomed, drugged and routinely raped over six years.

Council chiefs last night faced calls to set up an inquiry after it emerged that all the girls involved were known to social services or had been in their care.

Major operation: Dozens of officers are briefed before descending on homes across Oxford in a series of dawn raids to arrest a gang on suspicion of child sex trafficking

Mobilising: Officers loads up their cars as prepared to execute 14 warrants across the city

The shocking scale of abuse in the 
affluent university city of Oxford was revealed after police arrested 13
 men on suspicion of a variety of offences, including causing the 
prostitution of females under the age of 18, trafficking and rape.

Police are investigating the theory 
that the paedophile gang used social networking sites to swap 
information about victims, who in some cases were ‘conveyed’ to other 
parts of the country for sex.

All the victims were aged between 11 
and 16, and were described as being ‘very, very vulnerable’ by a senior 
detective. It is feared many more under-age girls were targeted by the 
gang.

All the victims were approached 
individually before being groomed for sex and  sold on for profit. The 
amounts of money involved are unclear but investigators believe 
thousands of pounds could have exchanged hands.

Thames Valley Police refused to reveal
 the ethnicity of the suspected gang members, saying such information 
could result in victims being identified.

Nor would they reveal whether the victims  had been in foster care or care homes when they were

Among those detained was a married 
father of two, aged 29, from the Cowley area of Oxford. A relative, who 
would not give his name, said: ‘The police came early this morning and 
arrested him. They would not say what he was arrested for. They said 
they were looking for evidence.’

Esther Davidson, from Oxford Community
 Against Trafficking, said: ‘We now have  to face the fact modern 
slavery takes  place in our community, and it involves children.

‘Yes, criminals are at work, but they 
are also exploiting demand. Demand for sex with under-age children is 
completely unacceptable.’

Sharon Highton, who runs the Include 
project at East Oxford Community Centre for youngsters who have been 
excluded from schools, said: ‘There is a huge problem with sex grooming 
in the area and social services are not taking any action. They seem to 
wait until something major happens before they intervene.’

Alleged members of the child sex ring 
were detained in a series of police raids early yesterday. More than 140
 officers burst into the homes of gang suspects and their ‘customers’ in
 synchronised raids across Oxford at 6am and arrested 12 men. A 
thirteenth suspect was arrested.

Protection: Detective Superintendent Rob Mason, of Thames Valley Police, said the arrests were intended to protect the girls from further harm

‘The investigation involves a criminal
 gang who are selling young girls for sex,’ said Detective 
Superintendent Rob Mason. ‘These include people involved in the business
 of selling young girls, and their customers.’

Most of the victims, who cannot be 
identified for legal reasons, are from the Oxfordshire area. ‘It would 
be fair to say that at different times in their lives they have all come
 to the notice of children’s services,’ said Detective Superintendent 
Mason.

Police said they were being trafficked within the UK.

‘What we believe we have uncovered is a
 criminal gang getting financial profit from selling  young girls and 
they are conveying them from Oxford to customers,’ he added.

‘We consider the girls to be very, 
very vulnerable and that’s why they have been targeted. The girls have 
gone missing and when they returned they have made certain disclosures.

‘Through children’s services and 
Oxfordshire County Council we have become aware of some of the 
activities the girls have been getting into when they’ve gone missing.’

The trafficking came to light when 
police began an investigation – codenamed Operation Bullfinch – looking 
at reports of girls going missing from their homes. The 13 suspects, 
aged between 21 and 37, were being interviewed at various police 
stations.

More than 40 uniformed officers and 
community support officers were yesterday handing out A5 flyers about 
the operation to reassure the public.

Detectives also posted a video on YouTube to reassure community members and urge any potential victims to come forward.

Stuart Craft, an Oxford councillor, 
said he had grave concerns about children’s services in the area. He 
added: ‘I would not be surprised if these exploited girls did not have 
any confidence in their social workers and that is why this has been 
allowed to go on for so long.’

Local councillor Mary Clarkson said: 
‘Children in care have had a bad start to life and they need to be 
protected. I would be very upset if it came to light that this was a 
failing on the part of social services and will be calling for an 
investigation if these girls were not given the right protection.’

Councillor Louise Chapman, cabinet 
member for children, young people and families at Oxfordshire Council, 
said: ‘The council has assisted in what has been a complex investigation
 leading to today’s events. Its focus has been, and will continue to be,
 on the care for alleged victims.’

Last night, four of those arrested, 
aged in their 20s and 30s, were released on police bail while detectives
 continue there
