Winner: James Arthur may have been victorious in last night's X factor final, but Jan Moir says that this has been the worst series of the show yet

Well, in the end that was quite the X Factor series, wasn’t it? For all the wrong reasons rather than the right ones.

From Tulisa’s fag ash breath to Gary Barlow storming off in a toddler-style strop at Ella’s early exit, to Christopher ‘Baloney’ Maloney withdrawing from last night’s show in a huff, surely this will go down in history as the showbiz car crash at the end of the rocky road for the X Factor.

How could it get any worse? Two million viewers have already escaped, bolting like rampaging wildebeest, probably never to return.

Why? For a start, Simon Cowell’s natural authority at the top of the X Factor Christmas tree is much missed. Louis, Gary, Tulisa and Nicole can blather on all they want, but without Simon there to wave his magic wand and turn Cinderellas into stars, what is the point? There isn’t one.

This year, the rise and rise of the ghastly cruise ship yodeller Baloney, a chancer hosed down in fake tan and onion tears, made a mockery of the whole process.

Yet the greedy X Factor bosses only have themselves to blame.

The change in the voting rules, which meant that viewers could vote all through the show rather than just at the end, after they had watched everyone perform, making their judgement on that basis, turned the whole thing into a popularity contest rather than a talent show.

Into a joke, really.

Yes, it must have increased their lovely, scrumptious revenues from the phone lines, but look what happened!

With voters in his Liverpool hometown swinging behind him every week, the talent-free Baloney sailed through every round.

For this we all suffered – and the X Factor lot only have themselves to blame that their audience is 20 per cent down on last year.

And was it my imagination, or was the natural cruelty of the show much more pronounced this year?

Finalist: Contestant Christopher Maloney, a 'ghastly cruise ship yodeller' according to Jan Moir

Certainly, the judges were more involved in the mentoring process this time around, but this has a downside.

Namely, it seems callous of them to pretend that their relationship with their acts is anything more than fleeting. And professional.

With his best smile pasted onto his face, Gary told phoney Baloney that they were ‘friends’ and that he could duet with him ‘anytime’ – anytime he didn’t see him coming first, is what I think he meant.

Lacking: The X Factor isn't the same without Simon Cowell says Jan Moir

Meanwhile, Nicole gushed on  about Jahmene being a ‘lamb chop’, a ‘lamb shank’ and yes, ‘a true  friend‘, too.  

‘She really gets me,’ said Jahmene, this sweet-voiced, church-going, virginal Asda shelf-stacker and his Pussycat Doll pal. It all makes for rather uncomfortable viewing.  

X Factor judges must tread rather more carefully, for they tread on dreams.

In a shameless bid to make themselves seem nicer people, they give these susceptible kids a taste of stardom and a glimpse of celebrity camaraderie that is perhaps unrealistic.

Acts such as Jahmene and James, who were keen to show us the drudgery of their hopefully former lives, might have to live forever with that ‘could have been’ moment.

Or perhaps, with the advent of every X Factor series, even the contestants are more knowing?

For win or not, after an initial burst of stardust, more and more of these wannabes just seem to disappear into the blackness without trace, just another firework on a winter afternoon.

Although some of them will never give up on livin’ the desperate dream.

‘Its massive. I’ve never wanted anything so much in me entire life,’ chirruped Christopher Maloney on Saturday night, as if that was somehow a valediction.

The show’s producers are already joyfully airbrushing Baloney out of X Factory history, and yes, the two final shows were well produced. But the damage has been done.

This was the worst series in the history of the show, one which was marred by mediocrity and mired in scandal. You know what really hurts? The ghastly Rylan Clark, booted out in week eight, is going to be the biggest star of them all.

Things have to improve next year. If there is going to be a next year.
