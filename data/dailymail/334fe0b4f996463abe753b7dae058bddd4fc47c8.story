A man pulled a pistol on his friends and opened fire, killing one and critically wounding another, in a dispute over beer money, a court heard.

Gumaro Torres has been charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon over the shootings in Chicago, Illinois.

The 31-year-old is being held with no bail after the fatal incident on the 1800 block of North Pulaski Road, in Chicago's Hermosa neighbourhood, late last Friday night.

Prosecutors allege that Torres was sitting drinking around a picnic table in the back yard of a home with a group of others when he began to get angry at getting no change from his beer money.

An argument broke out and after a short while the suspect is alleged to have left the group and gone to his nearby home before returning with a loaded 9mm semi-automatic hand gun.

'He stated that he was angry that when he returned the victims laughed at him,' prosecutors told the court.

Incensed, he 'immediately began to fire his gun at Jose De LaFuente,' prosecutors were quoted by the Chicago Tribune as saying.

Mr De LaFuente, 35, was shot in the abdomen and died at Mount Sinai Hospital at 2.45am on Saturday morning.

Another friend tried to tackle Torres but, as he approached, was shot in the hand, abdomen, leg and right hip.

The injured 27-year-old remains in a critical condition at the Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center.

A third man was able to subdue Torres, but not before suffering several 'pistol whips' in the head with the butt of the pistol.

He was treated at the scene and released.
