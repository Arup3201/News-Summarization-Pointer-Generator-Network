Australia is yet to receive a formal request from US President Barack Obama to join military action against militants in northern Iraq.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott says that the crisis in the region 'is as near to pure evil as we are likely to see'.

'What is at risk here in Northern Iraq is potential genocide, a humanitarian catastrophe on a scale unparalleled in recent times,' Mr Abbott said.

"Australia not been officially asked for military assistance' says the Prime Minister in regard to action against ISIL in northern Iraq

'To his great credit, President Obama has organised air-strikes against the murderous hordes of ISIL - those air strikes have lifted the siege of Mount Sinjar, which apparently stopped the advance of ISIL forces into Kurdish areas.'

But the PM says he has not yet had word directly from the President calling for Australia's involvement.

'There is obviously discussions going on between the United States and it's friends and allies, about what more can be done to avert further disasters in this part of the world,' he said.

Barack Obama is yet to make the call to Prime Minister Tony Abbott for Australian military assitance

'I have to say that Australia has not been officially asked for military assistance.

'If we were asked for military assistance, there would be the standard approvals process, that would involve Cabinet decision making and consultation with the Opposition.

Any involvement, he said, would be dependent on a range of factors.

'Should we be asked we would want to look at any request in the light of achievable objectives, a clear role for Australian forces, a full risk assessment and an overall humanitarian objective,' Mr Abbott added.

However, he alluded to imminent involvement by stressing 'no human being anywhere, would wish to stand by and watch the preventable slaughter of innocent people'.
