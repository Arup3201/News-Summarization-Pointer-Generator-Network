If two dogs can't sit on their porch wearing check flannel shirts and playing bluegrass on a banjo and a mandolin in the afternoon breeze, then when can they?

In this hilarious mock-up video posted on YouTube, the pair of musical pooches put on a show in full country get-up with the sweet sounds of the south.

The dogs do get a helping hand, so to speak, but that doesn't detract from the magical music being made.

Thumbs up for a job well done: The bluegrass tune rolls along thanks to the masterful pooches

The video is a creation of Cameron Owens, a musician from Johnson City Tennesee.

Originally from Boone, North Carolina, Owens lists on his Facebook profile that he plays mandolin and sings in two bands - Sons of Bluegrass and The Honey Chasers.

Given Owens's affinity for the mandolin, he's a good bet to be behind dog number one.

Although there doesn't appear to be any overt competition between the dogs, the title of the video is 'Dogs play Dueling Banjos'.

'Mrs Molly strikes again with her loving husband, Smoke.'

They were dueling? Let's call it a win for Mrs Molly, then.
