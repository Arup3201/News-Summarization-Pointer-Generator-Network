A member of Manchester United's catering staff was arrested after £430 went missing from an Old Trafford kiosk.

The 20-year-old woman was held at the stadium shortly after the club's 3-1 Premier League victory over Leicester City on Saturday.

Sportsmail understands the alarm was raised when a check of a cash register revealed it was substantially short.

Staff who worked in the kiosk were then searched and when one was found in possession of cash police were called and the arrest was made.

A United source said: 'It wasn't exactly a criminal mastermind. You'd think whoever was going to do it would take the odd £20 but you can't take over £400 and think nobody will notice.'

They added: 'Staff in the kiosks are forbidden from having cash on them when they go to work. When they have done the cashing up after they have closed they've realised that they were £400 down.

'They've then searched each person who was working in the kiosk and when they have found money on one of them they have called the police.'

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed the arrest. 

He said: 'At around 5pm on Saturday 31st January 2015, police were called to a food kiosk at Old Trafford football ground following reports that more than £400 had been stolen from the till.

'Officers attended and arrested a 20-year-old woman on suspicion of theft.

'She was subsequently bailed until 6th February.'

Manchester United declined to comment.
