Veteran TV and radio presenter Stuart Hall was last night charged with indecently assaulting three girls.

The former It’s A Knockout host and BBC Radio 5 Live commentator was arrested by police during a dawn swoop on his £1.5million detached home yesterday.

The 82-year-old was then taken to a police station where he was questioned for several hours over accusations of indecent assault.

Last night he was charged with 
indecently assaulting three girls – one as young as eight – in alleged 
attacks dating back to 1974.

John Dilworth of the Crown Prosecution
Service said: ‘Following investigations by Lancashire Police into 
allegations of sexual assault by Stuart Hall I have reviewed all the 
evidence that they have gathered and have authorised Lancashire Police 
to charge him with three counts of indecent assault.’

The first charge is that between September and December 1974 Hall indecently assaulted a woman who was then aged 16 or 17 years.

The second charge alleges he indecently assaulted a girl aged eight or nine in 1983.

Finally he is accused of indecently assaulting a 13-year-old girl between July and September 1984.

Mr Dilworth said: ‘I have concluded 
that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction
and that it is in  the public interest to prosecute  this case.’

Hall, famed for his distinctively 
highbrow approach to football commentary, was released from custody and 
bailed to appear before magistrates next month.

He was arrested in the early hours of 
yesterday morning at his family home in a quiet leafy area of Wilmslow, 
Cheshire, where he lives with his wife of 44 years, Hazel, 74.

The TV presenter was famous for appearing on It's A Knockout and still contributes to BBC Radio 5 Live

Police officers arrived early yesterday morning to arrest the veteran presenter and search his Wilmslow home

The couple, who have two grown-up 
children, Daniel and Francesca, are popular among the local community 
where they carry out a lot of charity work.

Yesterday forensic officers were 
searching their five-bedroom house on the edge of the upmarket town – 
which also boasts Sir Alex Ferguson as  a resident.

Neighbours were not answering their 
doors yesterday but a builder working on a nearby property said: ‘We saw
two police cars in his driveway at 8am but had no inkling as to what 
was going on.

‘We didn’t see him come out of the house or anything. The next thing we knew the police cars had gone.

‘It’s incredible to think they had come to arrest Stuart Hall.’

BBC Radio 5 Live last night announced that Hall would  not be working for them while the police investigation was continuing.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘In light of the
very serious nature of these charges Stuart Hall will not be working at
the BBC while the police continue with their enquiries.’

A police spokesman said: ‘We take all allegations of sexual abuse extremely seriously.

‘We would encourage people with any 
information about sexual abuse or who has been a victim of sexual abuse 
to come forward and report their concerns confident in the knowledge it 
will be investigated appropriately and with sensitivity.’

Hall has been bailed to appear at Preston Magistrates’ Court on January 7.

The broadcaster’s arrest  comes as the
beleaguered BBC continues to deal with the  fall-out of the Jimmy 
Savile sex abuse scandal.

Police confirmed the arrest did not 
form part of Operation Yewtree – the investigation into alleged sexual 
offences by late Top Of The Pops presenter Savile and others.

A spokesman said of Hall’s arrest: ‘I can categorically confirm this arrest is not part of Operation Yewtree in any way.’

Stuart Hall’s distinctive tones, exuberant delivery and often florid football match reports have enlivened the airwaves for five decades.

Along the way, the veteran broadcaster has earned ‘national treasure’ status – not least for his equally over-excitable commentaries on It’s A Knockout.

As competitors clad in giant, silly 
costumes hurled themselves around obstacle courses and frequently fell 
over, Hall regularly failed to suppress his mirth and his fits of 
incoherent laughter became, for many, as big a part of the popular BBC 
TV show as its slapstick challenges.

A 'national treasure': Stuart Hall presented It's A Knockout from 1972 to 1982

So popular was the show, which Hall presented from 1972 to 1982 (as well as several subsequent special shows), that nearly one in three surveyed in a recent poll said it was one of the bygone features of British life they would most like to return.

Hall, who was raised in Hyde, Manchester, and Glossop, Derbyshire, joined the BBC in 1959 as a general reporter on Radio Newsreel. Between 1965 and 1990 he presented the BBC’s regional news programmes for the North West.

A lifelong Manchester City supporter, Hall was the original host of BBC quiz A Question Of Sport. He still works as a football reporter for BBC Radio 5 Live, where his reports often feature allusions to Shakespeare and various linguistic gymnastics.

He claims to have coined the phrase the ‘beautiful game’ to describe football.

In 1999 a House of Commons motion, congratulating Hall on his 40-year career, stated: ‘His rich mellifluous voice is redolent of Sinden and Gielgud intertwining Shakespeare, Keats, Wordsworth et al amid the mud and tears at Accrington Stanley.’

Hall was awarded the OBE last December in the New Year Honours list for his services to broadcasting and charity.

He
said afterwards: ‘I’ve always regarded myself as a second-rate 
provincial hack. Well, that was yesterday. Now I’ve got the OBE, I’m 
still a provincial second-rate hack, but I’m a good one!’

Last year, asked if retirement was on the agenda, he said: ‘I intend to go on and on and on.’
