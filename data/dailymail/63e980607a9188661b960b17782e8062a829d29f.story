QPR midfielder Joey Barton has accused Arsenal of having 'no spine or character'.

Gunners manager Arsene Wenger celebrates 18 years at the helm with a London derby against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. 

In the previous campaign, the Frenchman's side took just three points from a possible 15 in away matches against the other teams in the top seven, conceding 21 goals.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Barton said that rival managers 'had Wenger on toast'.  

'In big games they get under his skin and work them out tactically,' he explained.

Barton said: 'You think of his teams of [Emmanuel] Petit, [Patrick] Vieira, [Tony] Adams, [Martin] Keown and all those kind of warriors. You look around the Arsenal dressing room now, the people who would win you those kind of games against the top four clubs - they don't really have an abundance of them.

'At the latter stages of a season they come unstuck because of that lack of - I hate to say it - a real lack of character or spine within the team.'

Away to Everton, that poor away form looked likely to continue as Wenger saw his side go 2-0 down, before managing to take a point away with late goals from Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud.

The Gunners biggest test comes on Sunday at Chelsea.

And with Wenger's terrible record against Jose Mourinho, Arsenal will do well to get something out of the game.
