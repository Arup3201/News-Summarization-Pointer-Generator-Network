The star Ukip candidate accusing one of Nigel Farage's closets allies of being a sex pest was facing further embarrassing revelations tonight - after her claim to have been a teacher was thrown into doubt.

Natasha Bolter was introduced to the Ukip conference earlier this year as a Labour defector who had gone into teaching after a stellar education culminating in a degree from Oxford University.

But her claim to have read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford unravelled yesterday when the institution took the rare step of denying she had ever attended.

It then emerged today that she was only a ‘cover supervisor’ at a comprehensive school in east London - and not a teacher - as Ukip supporters were led to believe. 

Mrs Bolter, seen above leaving her home, misspelt her supposed Oxford alma mater Wadham College as ‘Wadam’ on her CV – and said she was aged 35, rather than 39

In fact Ms Bolter had not worked at any school in the borough since Spring 2013, a spokesman for Barking and Dagenham council told the Telegraph.

It also emerged today that she did not ‘defect’ from Labour – and was in fact thrown out for failing to pay her membership fees.

Ms Bolter's decision to quit Ed Miliband's party was hailed as a major coup for Ukip.

But the divorced mother-of-five was only a Labour member for just eight months, party sources confirmed.

The revelations came after the Mail learnt she even misspelt her supposed Oxford alma mater Wadham College as ‘Wadam’ on her CV – and said she was aged 35, rather than 39.

Mrs Bolter claims she was sexually harassed by Roger Bird, one of Nigel Farage’s key lieutenants.

Mr Bird has said the pair were in a relationship. Mrs Bolter told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I didn’t sleep with Roger Bird, end of.’ But he insisted: ‘For the record, yes she did.’

Yesterday it emerged she sent him flirty text messages two days after the harassment claims were made. One said: ‘Love or infatuation made me lose my brain.’

Roger Bird said he was in a relationship with Mrs Bolter, who denied she had slept with him. 

She was a dream candidate for male-dominated Ukip because she is female, the daughter of immigrants and a former Labour supporter. But she exploded a grenade in the party by claiming in The Times that Mr Bird had propositioned her at his club.

On Monday, Ukip said Mr Bird had been suspended while it looked at claims of ‘impropriety’.

At Ukip’s September conference, Mr Bird introduced Mrs Bolter, saying: ‘She got five A grades at A-levels and went on to read PPE at Wadham College, Oxford.’

She repeated the Oxford claims in an unpublished interview with The Times, it is understood. But the university said it could find no evidence Mrs Bolter – then Natasha Ahmed – was a student. It said: ‘Oxford University has no record of a Natasha Ahmed with a birthday of 12 July 1975.’

Last night a friend said she did study in Oxford – on a teaching course at the now-defunct Westminster Institute of Education at Oxford Brookes University.
