A model is suing Playboy and a radio host after a 2012 stunt left her struck in the backside with a golf club.

Elizabeth Dickson, 28, is suing Playboy Enterprises and radio host Kevin Klein for $500,000 plus punitive damages after he whacked her in the behind with a golf club while trying to hit a ball off a tee placed between the cheeks of her buttocks during an amateur golf tournament in California.

The model claims in a copy of the lawsuit reviewed by MailOnline that she gave no consent for the ball to actually be hit and that she has suffered pain, worrying and anxiety as a result of the incident.

Being sued: Radio host Kevin Klein and Playboy are being sued by model Elizabeth Dickson after he whacked her in the buttocks with a golf club

Dickson was invited to the Playboy Golf Finals held March 30, 2012 at the Industry Hills, according to the complaint. Klein is a co-host of the Playboy Morning Show.

She complied with a request early in the day to lie ‘flat on her stomach with her buttocks partially exposed for a photograph’ with Klein, the suit first reported by TMZ alleges.

‘A golf tee was then placed between the cheeks of her buttocks and a golf ball was balanced on top of the tee,’ the suit continues.

Dickson was led to believe that the pose would include only a depiction of Klein hitting the ball of the tee for a picture, and not him actually swinging the golf club – but he did swing the club, and he missed badly.

‘[Dickson] sustained severe bodily injuries, a portion of which are permanent,’ according to the lawsuit.

The suit claims Dickson was an ‘unwilling participant’ in his ill-fated swing and that it caused severe emotional and physical trauma.

Both Dickson’s lawyer and a Playboy spokesperson did not immediately respond to MailOnline messages left for comment.
