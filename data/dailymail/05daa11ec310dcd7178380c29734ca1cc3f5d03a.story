Seldom has there been such a collection of talented footballers around one dinner table.

Zinedine Zidane has posted a photograph from a reunion of France's 1998 World Cup-winning squad in Paris on Monday night, featuring stars such as Laurent Blanc, Fabien Barthez, Didier Deschamps and Lilian Thuram.

'France 98 a Paris! Dinner with great friends and players in Paris!' Zidane wrote with his Instagram snap.

Zidane was the star of the team that fought their way through a tournament held on home turf and then spectacularly beat Brazil 3-0 in the final, securing their one and so far only World Cup triumph.

Zizou, who scored twice in that final, sits in the foreground with defenders Bixente Lizarazu and Blanc, the current manager of Paris Saint-Germain.

On his other shoulder are midfielder Christian Karembeu, who works at Greek side Olympiacos, Bernard Diomede and Ludovic Giuly, who wasn't in the 1998 squad.

Behind them are defender Thuram, back-up goalkeeper Bernard Lama, Leboeuf, Deschamps, Christophe Dugarry, Sabri Lamouchi, who didn't make the final squad, and Barthez.

The other members of Aime Jacquet's 1998 squad were Vincent Candela, Patrick Vieira, Youri Djorkaeff, Marcel Desailly, Stephane Guivarc'h, Robert Pires, Thierry Henry, Alain Boghossian, Emmanuel Petit, David Trezeguet and Lionel Charbonnier.

Drawn in Group C, France beat South Africa 3-0, Saudi Arabia 4-0 and Denmark 2-1 to advance comfortably to the last 16.

They then required a golden goal in extra time from  Blanc to see off Paraguay before they beat Italy on penalties in the quarter-finals after a goalless draw.

Two goals from Thuram guided France through their semi-final against Croatia and took them to that unforgettable night in the Stade de France against Brazil.

With Brazil distracted by concerns over Ronaldo's fitness, Zidane's two first-half goals put France firmly in the ascendancy and Petit rounded off the win in second-half stoppage time.
