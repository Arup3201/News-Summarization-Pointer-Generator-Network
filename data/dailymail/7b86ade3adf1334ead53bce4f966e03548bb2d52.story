Australian extremist Mohamed Elomar has used Sydney's deadly cafe siege as his latest excuse to exhort Muslims to create chaos in the city by beheading civilians 'ISIS style.'

Elomar took to Twitter to gloat at the mayhem surrounding the siege, in which lone fanatic Man Haron Monis held 17 hostages at gunpoint in a central Sydney cafe before police stormed in. Two hostages and Monis were killed.

'How to create chaos in Sydney CBD? ISIS style just start beheading civilians and you will see how they would all scatter like rats,' a tweet posted on an account believed to be used by Elomar said.

In a series of later tweets, he says any Australian Muslims should understand that Australia is responsible for killing Muslims in Iraq and Syria, and that 'anyone who has his passport stripped away by his government should start killing innocent civilians.'

'Target schools, shopping centre's, hotels, New years eve, anuthing just to put terror in the hears of the disbelievers,' he tweeted.

The Daily Telegraph reported that Abu Hamza Almuhajir also mocked the Sydney siege situation.

The former Street Dawah member, a close friend of Islamic State commander Mohammad Ali Baryalei, posted a series of messages online as well.

'The world must stand for the news of 13 Australian hostages but it would sleep for the news of over 130000 Muslims killed in Syria,' he posted on Twitter.

'There was no Muslim extremists committing crimes in Australia ever before Australia decided to go to Iraq and Syria.' 

Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia had also previously supported hostage taker Monis after he was convicted of sending hate letters to the families of dead soldiers. 

In a tweet former Street Dawah member, Abu Hamza Almuhajir, believed that what Monis (pictured) did showed the world 'if U harm our people we will harm your people, leave us alone'
