It seems now there is only one man who has what it takes to interview Mario Balotelli... and that is Mario Balotelli himself!

In a highly amusing interview, the Italian striker poses himself a series of questions related to his World Cup memories, his Italy team-mates and his hopes for the summer in Brazil.

In the video, Balotelli discusses Italy's last win in 2006, the infamous Zinedine Zidane headbutt from the final and his belief when he was younger that he'd definitely make it to a World Cup one day.

Balotelli was a key part of the Italy side that made it to the finals of Euro 2012, famously scoring twice against Italy in the final, and he believes the squad are even stronger now than they were then - picking out Andrea Pirlo and Gianluigi Buffon as two of the key names.

When pushed (albeit by himself) on who were most technical, best looking and coolest players in the squad were, you won't be too surprised to hear who his answer was.

And he jokingly said that when he wins the golden boot at the World Cup, it would go into the wardrobe with the rest of his shoes!

Italy start their World Cup campaign against England on June 14, before rounding off their Group D campaign with games against Costa Rica and Uruguay.
