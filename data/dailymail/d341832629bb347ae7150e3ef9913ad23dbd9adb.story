A horrified mother has said she will never shop at Iceland again after finding a snail in her toddler daughter's dinner.

Daisy Simpson, two, from Deal, Kent shouted 'snail, snail' when she spotted the mollusc on her plate of broccoli and cauliflower bake on Saturday.

The snail's eyes were still visible even though it had been cooked from frozen.

Daisy Simpson, two, found a snail in her dinner after it got into a bag of broccoli and cauliflower. Her mother Jessica Lawson says that she will never shop at Iceland again

Her mother Jessica Lawson, 22, bought the £1 frozen vegetable bag from Iceland in Deal.

The next day she went back to the store to complain, and was offered a £20 food voucher as an apology.

Mother Jessica Lawson feels that Iceland haven't taken the discovery seriously enough

But she claims that staff at the store's head office did not seem to care about the shocking incident.

The single mother-of-two who works as a carer, said: 'Daisy suddenly shouted out 'snail, snail.'

'I had seen it but I thought it was just a piece of dark broccoli.

'It is just so lucky that Daisy didn't put it into her mouth and she knows what a snail is.

'I won't be shopping in there again.'

She added: 'I'm not happy about it, they are supposed to sell food that is checked.

'The women at head office said 'it's just a snail to me' which is really impolite.'

Iceland PR manager Ninka Davies said: 'We take all complaints very seriously.

'We have strict product controls in place and it's very rare that something should slip through the net.'
