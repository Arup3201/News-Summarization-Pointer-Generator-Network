IT has been widely acknowledged that the new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has had a good World Cup but at the Maracana on Sunday night there might yet be one player who could embarrass him, even though Holland departed the tournament on Saturday.

Toni Kroos, the playmaker in the German midfield, is in the form of his life. Although Germany’s semi-final performance against Brazil has been rightly acknowledged as an extraordinary team effort, if there was one player who provided the nexus for all that slick passing and crisp finishing, it was Kroos.

Threat: Germany's Toni Kroos celebrates scoring against Brazil in World Cup semi-final

‘Like Xavi and Iniesta rolled into one,’ said the usually conservative 
newspaper, Sud-deutsche Zeitung, of his performance, and they were not 
far off the mark.

But Kroos is off to Real Madrid this summer, even 
though Manchester United were initially in the forefront of the race to 
sign him. David Moyes was confident that the player would come and other
 sources at United confirm that there was an excellent chance of him 
joining.

Van Gaal’s appointment saw a change in tack, however. 
Getting players out of Bayern Munich is never easy but Van Gaal, who 
coached there from 2009-2011 and knows most of the squad well —including
 Kroos — was clear about his preferred players from their pool: Thomas 
Muller and Bastian Schweinsteiger.

Muller has since signed a new  
contract with Bayern but recruiting Schweinsteiger is still a 
possibility, though the uncharacteristically calamitous manner in which 
Bayern have handled Kroos’s contract negotiations may mean that they do 
not want to let another star man go.

For Kroos has been something of 
an outsider, both at Bayern and in German football, until now. Even a 
week ago, as his influence on the World Cup grew, there was still a 
sense of him having to prove  something to those back home.

‘I hope 
I’ve given a few doubts to those who say: “You can’t count on Kroos in 
big games”,’ he said. ‘I want to produce something special at this World
 Cup.

‘I can’t afford to relax. World class or not, what is important to 
me is that I’m at a higher level than I was a few years ago and that I 
maintain the level that I showed for Bayern Munich this season. I’m a 
different player — busier on the pitch and more dominant.’

He has 
achieved all that and more with his performances against France and 
Brazil. Kroos may well be the best midfielder in the world right now, 
which makes it all the more puzzling that Van Gaal has not pursued the 
deal.

It is always possible that once Real Madrid became involved, 
United would have been gazumped anyway. But it is clear that United were
 a long way down the line towards persuading him to join.

Perhaps 
Van Gaal has memories of the old Kroos: the one who was blamed for 
letting Italy’s Andrea Pirlo run the game in the Euro 2012 semi-final, 
which Germany lost; the one who missed a late chance in the 2010 World 
Cup semi-final against Spain when he came on as a substitute; the one 
whose midfield tactical sense was questioned after the 2012 World Cup 
qualifier in Berlin in which Germany led Sweden 4-0 with 28 minutes to 
play, only to surrender initiative and end up drawing 4-4.

Certainly 
it is said that Kroos responded much better to the more avuncular 
management style of his early coach at Bayern, Ottmar Hitzfeld, than the
 abrasive Van Gaal. Indeed, until recently he never seemed to be part of
 the inner core of the Bayern team and that is precisely why the club is
 on the verge of losing him now. Kroos decided he deserved to be paid a 
salary ranking alongside the Bayern aristocrats such as Schweinsteiger 
and Philipp Lahm of around £8 million a year, and went public in his 
observation.

Snub: Kroos has impressed in Brazil but not enough to convince Louis van Gaal to sign him for Manchester United

For Bayern, that was a violation of the unwritten club code that you bide your time and work your way up the hierarchy. They offered him around £6m, seeing him as a very good club player but not one of the best in the world.

Although his coach Pep Guardiola enthused about him, the club were continuing to treat him like a naughty boy, as recently as March, when the prevailing attitude was that he would be held to his contract until 2015 and then released on a free, rather than be sold.

The logic was that they needed to make an example of him to other players to demonstrate that his behaviour was not acceptable. While some at  Bayern hope that they might persuade him to stay, that there is still a one per cent chance of getting him to sign up beyond 2015. Too late, it seems. Kroos, transformed from an outsider to the cornerstone of the national team, has settled on Real Madrid.

It is an extraordinary example of mismanagement by Bayern, though not unique. Mats Hummels, another star of this German team, was once at Bayern before they let him go to Borussia Dortmund.

But Kroos had all the credentials to be at the heart of Bayern for years. He was homegrown, joining them at the age of 16 from the far-flung village of Greifswald, on the Baltic Sea in what was the old East Germany.

Born in 1990, the year of unification, he is the first generation of ‘Ossis’ (former residents of East Germany) to have no experience the old state. His mother, Birgit, was East German badminton champion, a formidable achievement in a state in which success at sport was considered one of the most important criteria. His father, Roland, is a youth team coach with Hansa Rostock and his brother Felix plays for Werder Bremen.

He burst on the scene at Bayern Munich, a wunderkind at 17, becoming the youngest player at the time to make his professional debut for the club, against Energie Cottbus. He thrived under Hitzfeld, but not under Jurgen Klinsmann, and was loaned to Bayer Leverkusen. Van Gaal recalled him but only under Jupp Heynckes and Guardiola has he prospered.

He understands his role precisely. ‘I know that my job is to give the team clarity and security with the ball,’ he said during the World Cup, though the actual German phrase he used was: ‘I know that I’m predestined to give the team clarity and security.’

There is an intensity  and seriousness about the way he describes the role; it also suggests that however strong the lingering Communist influences of his upbringing in East Germany, it failed to eradicate Lutheran values.

Though he left school at 16 and was not the most enthusiastic  student — knowing that he had a Bayern contract lined up could not have helped — he speaks excellent English. As for today’s final, despite the extraordinary nature of the performance against Brazil, there is a little danger of him or any of the Germans getting carried away.

‘The feeling in the dressing-room wasn’t euphoric,’ said Kroos, reflecting on the 7-1 demolition of Brazil. ‘We’re all totally focused now on the chance that we have. We’re quite clear that we have come here with aim of becoming world champions. And World Cups are not decided in semi-finals.

We know that it was just one game in the plan to achieve our goal.’One more game and they could be there; and Kroos will be acknowledged among the world’s best.
