Three Royal Marines will stand trial next week for the alleged murder of a Taliban prisoner held in their custody in Afghanistan.

The Commandos, who for security reasons can only be identified as Marines A, B and C, are accused of the suspected execution of a wounded enemy combatant at a British base.

The case, which is the first time British troops have been charged with murder in the 12-year conflict, is considered so sensitive that Prime Minister David Cameron has been briefed on its progress by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.

The incident first emerged after civilian police officers found footage on a Marine's laptop while investigating entirely unrelated crime. The video appeared to show Commandos standing over a captive and discussing his fate - the Afghan had apparently  suffered injury during a shootout with UK forces.

Civilian police officers informed the Royal Military Police (RMP) of their concerns and a major investigation  was launched.

The RMP then cross-referenced the video evidence with reports of enemy engagements at that location on or about September 15, 2011.

A year later seven Royal Marines were arrested and five were charged under military law with the 'murder of an unknown captured person'. The Service Prosecuting Authority later dropped the murder charges against two Marines.

The court martial at Bulford, Wiltshire, is scheduled to start on Wednesday with the evidence expected to be heard until November 15.

More than 63,000 people have joined a Facebook group set up to support the Royal Marines linked to the incident.

Fears remain that the case will be exploited for propaganda purposes by UK-based terrorists.

For this reason, Judge Advocate Jeff Blackett is expected to rule that anonymity orders for the three Marines should remain in place for the duration of legal proceedings.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
