Clifford Fleming, 65, who wrote to bank staff demanding £150,000. However, his distinctive handwriting - which police spotted scrawled in a crossword puzzle - gave him away

For detectives on the trail of a blackmailer who threatened to plant a bomb in a busy a town centre, the clue was in the crossword.

Because the handwriting on a note demanding staff at Barclays bank leave £150,000 in a bag in an alleyway was very distinctive.

And when police visited former soldier and ardent puzzler, Clifford Fleming, 65, they found an exact match in a crossword in a copy of a newspaper.

Fleming, a former Army soldier, was beginning a three-year jail sentence after he pleaded guilty to blackmail.

The court heard Fleming, 65, had dropped a terrifying handwritten demand into the bank's letter box overnight demanding £150,000 in used notes be left in a bag in an alley.

The note read: ‘This is a coded message. A bomb has been timed to explode at 1.30pm in a very busy place in Lancashire unless you follow this request to the letter.

‘Multiple deaths and injuries will occur unless you follow these demands.  Our people will be listening to the police and watching you. Don’t try to be a hero or carnage will ensue.’

Bank staff who opened it in the morning initially believed it was a prank but became concerned and decided to call their regional office.

The worker spoke to her manager who told her to inform police immediately and detectives, counter-terrorism officers and intelligence officers were scrambled to the picturesque village of Billington.

In the letter, Fleming, a father-of-four, had ordered bank staff to deposit the cash in a bag placed at the side of Billington Village Store at 12.15pm

So police officers went to the drop-off location and one minute before the deadline, Fleming was seen walking towards the alleyway.

Five minutes later he picked up a carrier bag and walked away.

Officers studied CCTV taken from the bank which appeared to show the same man posting a letter to the branch in the overnight box.

Fleming was snared by police, who spotted the handwriting on a newspaper crossword, left open on a coffee table at his home, matched that of the blackmail note.

Preston Crown Court heard how Fleming
 initially denied he was behind the threat but admitted it when they 
showed him the similarity between the crossword and the blackmail note.

During
 a police interview Fleming said he had a gambling addiction and had 
racked up huge debts and had lost the equity in his home.

Fleming demanded staff at Barclays bank left a bag stuffed with used bank notes next to Billington Village Store in the picturesque Lancashire village - or he'd detonate a bomb. He was sentenced to three years in jail for blackmail

He told them he had squandered a family inheritance, had a £13,000 credit card debt and feared he would not be able to afford healthcare or funeral costs for himself or his ailing wife.

Judge Heather Lloyd, sentencing, said: ‘‘You must know, particularly bearing in mind your army background, that in this day and age the authorities have to be particularly wary of threats of bombs and terrorism.

‘It is undoubtedly the case that you were under stress and in debt. You do suffer ill health, both physically and mentally, but how did you think the bank employees were going to react?

‘You wanted them to believe the threat. You made it appear that this wasn’t a plain prank and that there was some sort of organisation behind it.

‘You must know, particularly bearing in mind your army background, that in this day and age the authorities have to be particularly wary of threats of bombs and terrorism.

‘The amount of money said to have been spent is significant. Forty staff and officers were deployed, the duration of the operation was seven hours.’
