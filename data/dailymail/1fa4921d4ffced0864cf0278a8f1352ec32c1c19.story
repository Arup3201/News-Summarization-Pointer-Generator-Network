Caught: Fugitive Spanish terror suspect Raul Angel Fuentes Villota who has been on the run for 17 years

A suspected ETA terrorist linked to several murders was arrested in Britain today after 17 years on the run.

Raul Sanchez Fuentes Villota, 47, was held in Liverpool in a joint operation by UK and Spanish police.

The suspected terrorist was detained on an European Arrest Warrant issued by a judge at the National Court in Madrid, which deals mostly with terrorist cases.

The interior ministry said Fuentes was arrested at 9am in Liverpool, where he 'was residing with false documentation, waiting to receive instructions from the leadership of the terrorist group ETA.'

They said he had been part of an ETA terror cell called the Matalaz Cell, responsible for several terrorist attacks in Spain.

He allegedly joined the organisation in 1990 and was trained in firearms and explosives.

The Matalaz Cell has been linked by Spanish security services to several murders.

They include the April 1991 assassination of police officer Jose Manuel Cruz Martin, who was killed in a car bomb in Baracaldo.

He was arrested allegedly trying to carry out a similar murder two months later.

The interior ministry said in a statement: 'Following a shootout in June 1991 officers from the National Police arrested Fuentes and other members of the cell when they tried to place a limpet bomb in the vehicle of an officer from the National Police in Baracaldo.'

Wanted: Several alleged members of ETA have been arrested in the UK recently. Antonio Troitino Arranz, left, has been convicted of 22 murders, and Ignacio Lerin Sanchez, right, is considered one of ETAâ€™s most dangerous terrorists

Fuentes was arrested in June 1991 allegedly trying to plant a bomb under the car of a police officer in Barakaldo, in Vizcaya, a province in northern Spain.

He and two other alleged ETA members, Juan Maria San Pedro Blanco and German Urizar de Paz, exchanged fire with Spanish police officers as before they were arrested at the scene of the terror plot.

Fuentes was released on bail in June 1995 after spending four years on remand without trial - the longest allowed under Spanish law.

He disappeared two months later and an arrest warrant was issued in September 1995.

In 2002 police found a document linking Fuentes to the senior military leadership of ETA, after arresting ETA military leader Juan Fernandez Iradi.

Spain's Interior Ministry said in a 
statement: 'British police in collaboration with the National Police 
have this morning arrested the suspected member of ETA Raul Sanchez 
Fuentes Villota in Liverpool.

'The whereabouts of Fuentes Villota, suspected of several murders, have been unknown since 1995.'

Destruction: In July 1986 Troitino detonated a car bomb by remote control in the Plaza de la Republica Dominicana in Madrid. The blast destroyed a Civil Guard van, killing 12 officers and wounding 51 people

Several alleged members of ETA have been arrested in the UK recently.

They include Antonio Troitino, convicted of 22 murders, who was held in Hounslow, west London, in June.

Another fugitive, Benat Atorrasagasti was held as he walked out of a pub in Edinburgh the following month.

And police held ETA chief Eneko Gogeaskoetxea, 44, at a house in Cambridge, in July last year.

Killed: ETA separatists blew up a car in Madrid in 2000 killing Lt. Col. Pedro Antonio Garcia Blanco Garcia. ETA has killed more than 800 people since it launched its campaign for an independent Basque state

Gogeaskoetxea, wanted for attempting to assassinate King Juan Carlos in 1997, had been living there with his wife and two children under an assumed name and was a member of the local squash club.

Anti-terrorism experts say Britain became a favourite bolt-hole for ETA terrorists after France began cooperating with Spain to track down fugitives living there.

Spanish intelligence sources say there are around 180 ETA terrorists on the run.

ETA has killed more than 800 people since it launched its campaign for an independent Basque state in the late 1960s.

In January last year the group announced a 'permanent ceasefire' following more than 40 years of bloodshed.

The terrorist group is being urged to hand over its weapons and make a public apology to victims.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
