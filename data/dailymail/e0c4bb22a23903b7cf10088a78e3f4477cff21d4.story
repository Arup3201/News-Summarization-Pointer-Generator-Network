Manuel Pellegrini insists that a traumatic week of international football will not affect his Manchester City stars against Tottenham on Saturday.

Aleksandar Kolarov and Matija Nastasic were caught up in the politically-fuelled brawl that caused the Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania to be abandoned, while Yaya Toure flew back from West Africa on a private jet after playing for Ivory Coast against DR Congo amid growing concerns over the Ebola crisis.

City would not confirm whether Toure has been screened for the deadly virus, but Pellegrini revealed that the powerhouse midfielder is in the squad to face Spurs.

‘No, we are not concerned about it and Yaya is not concerned either,’ said the City boss. ‘I don’t think he will have any problems. I don’t know if he was screened but for the moment he’s OK.’

On the trouble in Belgrade, Pellegrini added: ‘They (Kolarov and Nastasic) both came back on Thursday. Of course it was not a good experience for them. It’s very difficult to be involved in those kinds of incidents. We will see what happens in the future, but it was a very bad thing for football. In both a political sense and football sense.

‘Of course it is not easy to see which is the best starting 11 when you have so many players arriving on different days during the week. Tomorrow we will decide. Yaya arrived yesterday with Kolarov and Nastasic, other players arrived on Wednesday and some on Tuesday. But all of them are in the squad list.’

The Premier League champions will be without Eliaquim Mangala at the Etihad on Saturday due to a thigh injury, but Pellegrini expects his £32million signing to be fit for Tuesday’s crucial Champions League tie away to CSKA Moscow which is being played behind closed doors.

City fly out on Sunday and must beat the Russians home and away to have a realistic chance of reaching the knockout stages. Pellegrini is trying to focus on keeping pace with leaders Chelsea, while his team also defend the Capital One Cup against Newcastle at the end of the month.

‘We know that from now until the next international break we have to play seven games in three different competitions,’ he said. ‘We have four games in the Premier League, and it is very important for us to try and recover points from Chelsea.

‘We also have one game against Newcastle which is final because if we don’t win we go out of the Capital One Cup. We have two games against CSKA Moscow in the Champions League and we need to win both of them.

‘The best way to think is that the next game is a final, which is Tottenham. We will try to win it and after we will see which is the best team to try and win the next final.’

City beat Spurs 11-1 on aggregate in the league last season, but Pellegrini added: ‘I’m sure it is a different Tottenham. We are not expecting that we can score six or five goals every time we play them.’
