Shocking footage of a fisherman beating shark over the head with plank of wood has triggered an online storm

Donning an apron, hoodie and a pair of fishing boots, he begins brutally smashing the shark over the head with a block of wood as it writhes to its death.

The shark can be seen squirming in its own blood as it struggles to let loose from the attack but flips over to its side within seconds before it stops wiggling.

‘And sleep,’ the final words said from the man before the footage cuts off.
