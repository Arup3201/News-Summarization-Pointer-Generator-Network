Pet owners hoping to give their pooches a taste of romance have turned to speed-dating in the hope of finding puppy love.

Dozens of dog-owners took their pampered pooches to a pet boutique in Wales for the doggy dates, swapping getting muddy in the park for a civilised meeting.

The speed-dating event is the brainchild of pet-lover Leanne Couch, who says both owners and pets prefer making a connection indoors rather than outside in the cold.

Dozens of dog owners took their pups to the parlour for the doggy dating night hoping to help their pooches find love

'It's been absolutely amazing,' said the pet fan. 'My [bichon frise] Lucy has had her eye on a few men.'

Couch, who staged the event at her Mucky Pups pet parlour in Cardiff, proclaimed the doggie-dating night to be a huge success.

As 'Who let the Dogs Out?' boomed out of the speakers, owners appeared to be enjoying the event almost as much as their pets.

One guest said she brought her pooch along because it is 'a great opportunity for her to meet other dogs and hopefully find some love.'

In a video of the night, Couch opens proceedings by saying: 'This evening I've held a doggy speed dating event and doggy disco. 'It's the first of it's kind and the first event that we've held.' 

The event certainly seemed to go down well with the canine guests, with one set of dogs getting very close on the dance floor.

What's more, the dogs weren't the only ones to get lucky, with Couch saying afterwards that a few human matches had been made as well.  

At the doggy speed-dating it was a chance for the dogs, and their owners, to get to know one another
