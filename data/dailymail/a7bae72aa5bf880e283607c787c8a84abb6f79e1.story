Ex-convict: Aston Barth has pleaded guilty to killing his neighbor in 2012

A cross-dressing ex-convict has admitted to strangling and hacking the neck of his neighbor before hiding his mutilated body in his bedroom closet more than a year ago.

Aston Martin Barth yesterday pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the brutal December 18, 2012, death of his childhood friend, Jason Campbell.

Moments before his trial began, Barth admitted to choking the 35-year-old before using an ax to partially 
slice off Campbell's head following an argument.

He then wrapped the body in a blanket and
 trash bag and stashed it in the cupboard in his Ferndale Boulevard, Long Island home.

Before Barth's mother and brother found the victim on Christmas Eve, the killer continued to go to work as a cook in a restaurant and told friends he didn't know what had happened to Campbell.

Long Island News Day reported that, in return for the plea, Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Glenn Kurtzrock agreed to recommend the minimum sentence of 15 years to life in prison.

Barth will be sentenced next month.

Campbell's family yesterday welcomed the plea and said they were relieved to avoid a trial.

'Part of it is relief that I don't have to go through the whole thing again,' Norma Campbell, the victim's mother, said.

'I live with it every day...I really would love to know the real 
reason he (Barth) did this.'

Latonya Mills, the mother of Campbell's two children aged three and five months, said she was still devastated.

'Jason was a good guy,' she said. 'He was a good father.'

At the time of the murder, Barth was on parole for a notorious 2007 bank robbery.

Wearing his mother's brown skirt suit, a blonde wig, sandals and makeup, Barth stole $11,000 from a Citibank branch in Central Islip.

He told his father, who drove him to the bank, he was dressed as a woman to participate in a survey.

Despite his meticulous disguise, the bank robber forgot to hide his mustache and was nabbed not long after.

Barth had a prior conviction for an armed robbery, for which he was sentenced to three years behind bars in 2001.

Barth's mother, Connie Barth, told Newsday her son had been treated for mental illness since childhood but refused help in recent years.

'I'm so sorry,' she told the newspaper.

'My son needed medication but he wouldn't take it. He would say, 'I can do this' without medication.'
