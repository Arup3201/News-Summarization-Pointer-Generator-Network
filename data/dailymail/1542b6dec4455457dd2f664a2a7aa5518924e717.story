A Queensland mother has received an anonymous note in her letterbox accusing her of being a negligent parent.

Trish LaForty, 26, arrived to her home on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland after a family day at the beach with her son Will on Thursday to find the insulting letter in her mailbox.

The note read: 'You may be able to ignore your baby crying but we are tired of listening to him crying non-stop all day.'

Shocked: Mother Trish LaForty, 26, (pictured left with her 11-month-old son Will) was left stunned after a disgruntled neighbour left a letter (pictured right) in her mailbox accusing her of being a negligent parent

Ms LaForty says the letter left her 'shocked and emotional. No mum wants to hear that message, regardless of how true it is.'

She has been living in the Coolum apartment block for six months, and had never had any bad blood with her neighbours before this.

Ms LaForty soon after posted the following message on a sunshine community Facebook page.

'To whoever wrote this note: thanks. Like being a parent isn't tough enough... You didn't even have the guts to come knock on our door.

'Like being a parent isn't tough enough': Ms LaForty (pictured left with her son) posted a picture of the note online accompanied by her response (pictured right)

'FYI Our baby doesn't cry 'all day', he cries when he doesn't want do go to sleep, when he's getting his nappy changed and when I say 'no' because I refuse to let him be spoiled and run around like he owns the joint.

'If you'd like to chat more, feel free to pop in. You obviously know where we live.'

She says the feedback to the post was overwhelming. 

Positive response: Ms LaForty says she has been inundated with messages of support after her post

'The message quickly had over 500 likes', she said. 'After that, my inbox was flooded with messages of support and encouragement.'

After this, Ms LaForty decided to speak with her immediate neighbours.

'I wanted to clear the air, but also to find out if anyone had experienced any similar notes.'

She said all of her neighbors were shocked, and had as little idea as her who was behind the note.

'I still have have no idea who it is. I guess it could be someone who sits at home all day with nothing better to do. 

'Maybe they could have offered a helping hand rather than writing than writing a silly letter?'

Ms LaForty says people should be more considerate of parents with young children.

'Every baby has good days and bad days. Parents should be able to have the support from their community,' she said.

'I think it's sad that there are still people out there who lack the true feel of what a community should be.'
