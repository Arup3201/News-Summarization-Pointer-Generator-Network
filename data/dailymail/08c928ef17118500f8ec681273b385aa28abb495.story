A private school teacher has been arrested after the teenage girl was allegedly spotted hiding under a blanket in his car.

John Wunderle, a maths teacher at the £15,000-a-year Bancroft's School in Essex, was already on bail after being accused of grooming the girl for six months and was arrested in May.

But he was detained again when he allegedly attempted to drive off with a youngster in Woodford Green, north east London on Friday after the girl was seen in his vehicle.

The 34-year-old, who is said to weigh 20 stone, has now been remanded in custody by magistrates and faces four allegations dating back to March of this year. 

The Metropolitan Police confirmed that a man was arrested on Friday for breaching bail conditions and subsequently appeared at Redbridge Magistrates on Saturday.

Wunderle had already quit his job at the school, where he has worked for the last six years, before the alleged offences.

The school is described as an independent day school and caters for pupils aged seven to 18.

It is believed he earns more than £40,000 in his job at the school but he had recently been living with his mother.

Headteacher at the school, Mary Ireland said: '(Wunderle) had already resigned and had a job somewhere else.

'That was a couple of months before (the arrest) and he was working through his notice. As soon as we were made aware of the allegation we immediately contacted the LADO (Local authority designated officer, a council official acting to safeguard children).

'As soon as we contacted the authorities they took over until the police investigation was complete. 

'The school couldn't take any disciplinary measures and he was suspended on full pay. We've continued to co-operate and we are trying to support the family of the girl involved at the same time.'

She said Wunderle's resignation had nothing to do with any inappropriate behaviour towards the girl. 

The Good Schools Guide gave Bancroft's a glowing report in the 2013 edition, stating: 'A splendid school, catering for bright children and those who will seize opportunities. Deservedly over-subscribed. Brings glory to Essex well beyond its immediate catchment.' 

He is expected to appear at Snaresbrook Crown Court later this month.
