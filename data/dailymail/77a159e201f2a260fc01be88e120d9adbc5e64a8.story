A man whose baby son went missing 21 years ago has spoken of the pain he felt as he watched officers search for the youngster's body.

Simon Ward, 42, a property developer from the north of England, flew to the Greek island of Kos when police from South Yorkshire started digging there in October, searching for the remains of Ben Needham, who vanished in July 1991 aged just 21 months.

He told the Daily Mirror how he dressed in clothes similar to police so he could watch the dig undisturbed as it unfolded, as well as about the painful mix of emotions he endured as he watched what could have been the final resting place of his beloved son.

Mystery: Ben Needham (left) was just 21 months old when he vanished in July 1991. His mother Kerry Grist (right) believes he is still alive

Co-operation: Greek and British police worked together to search for Ben, but found no trace of him. He would be around 23 years-old now

He said: 'I was watching every step of the way, every scoop of that digger, and it was weird because I wanted to be there, but at the same time there were heart-stopping moments when I thought they had made some kind of discovery.'

When he was not watching the dig he described how he would 'torture' himself by revisiting places in Kos that he had been with Ben.

'I would torture myself going back to places where I had been with him. Really I had just one good week with him in all my time with him on Kos, when we went to the beach,' he said.

Investigation: British officers search the ground for any sign of Ben using a mechanical digger. They have now returned to the UK

Painstaking: The latest search focused on a mound of soil and rubble near to where Ben went missing. It was thought the baby may have been covered by rubble during renovation work at the farmhouse

British officers joined their Greek 
counterparts and used specialist search dogs and hi-tech imaging equipment.
However, they drew a blank following an extensive search.

Det
Supt Matt Fenwick, from South Yorkshire Police, led the dig around the 
farmhouse in the hamlet of 
Iraklis that was being renovated when Ben disappeared 21 years ago.

He
said: 'Even after the search we have done you can never say 100 per 
cent, but the search has been so extensive and so thorough it is very 
unlikely that he could be in the specific locations where we have 
searched.”

Ben
was being cared for by his grandparents Eddie and Christine Needham 
when he vanished from outside the farmhouse.

Painstaking: Officers used intricate techniques to search the ground in the area where the youngster went missing

Intensive: British police were granted a permit to carry out the search from the authorities on Kos

One
theory is the toddler was accidentally trapped beneath piles of dirt 
and building material which were being dumped on the plot by a JCB 
digger working nearby.

Detectives
had believed that a small Dinky toy car belonging to Ben could be key 
to discovering his fate.

They used specialist scanning equipment to 
search for signs of buried metal as well as possible human remains.

Local
people in and around the village of Iraklise helped with the operation 
to find the youngster.

Intricate: It was hoped that the search would at least have revealed some clues to Ben's whereabouts - but none was found

At work: Officers used probes - together with more hi-tech equipment - to test the ground in their search for Ben

Authorities on Kos granted a permit for the excavation based on ‘reasonable suspicions’ by British police.

The cost of the operation – certain 
to be a substantial five figure sum – will be paid by British taxpayers.

Despite a number of possible sightings 
and a range of theories about what happened to him, no trace of the 
youngster has ever been found.
