A cat serial killer could be on the loose in Essex after more than 50 pets were poisoned over the past year.

Animal-lovers have been left mystified as to the killer's possible motive for his heartless acts.

Many are now scared to let their pets go outside out of fear they could be targeted by the poisoner in Shoeburyness, Essex.

Devoted: Ms Salter's 14-year-old daughter Georgia with Tilly before the cat was killed

Mystery: None of the victims have any clue why their pets were targeted and are urging police to crack down

Six cats have died from kidney failure attributed to consuming some sort of poison.

Police
have said they are keeping an open mind as to the cause of the deaths, 
but residents are convinced they are down to a single-minded killer.

Kiely
Salter, 36, was left heartbroken after her two-year-old cats Tilly and 
Stella died painful deaths within hours of each other.

'They died a horrible, cruel death and it certainly was not quick,' the mother of one said.

Killed: Tilly and Stella, owned by Kiely Salter, are among 50 cats poisoned by a mysterious killer

Target: Residents of this street in Shoeburyness have been victims of the cat poisoner

'I was with Tilly before she died and that cat was suffering horribly - the vet told me afterwards that her kidney was like that of a 15-year-old cat.

'My daughter Georgia is devastated as they were inseparable.'

After her two cats died, Ms Salter spoke to neighbours to warn them to be vigilant - but discovered that they had also been hit by the posioning epidemic.

There are another two cats which are still missing, leading to fears that the cat killer may have struck again.

Campaign: Glen Brunsden, who lives in Dovercourt, has had three of his cats killed

Victims: Jasper, left, and Ollie, right, were two of Mr Brunsden's cats which were poisoned

Another owner, who asked not to be named, added: 'It's very worrying for us because our cat means the world to us.

'People say it could be an accident - but when six are now dead and two more are missing, I think it does not take a genius to work out that something sinister is going on and that we have a cat killer round here.

'But why would someone want to harm them? It makes me so angry when I think about how they died.'

Essex Police are already investigating a spate of about 30 deaths in the town of Harwich, linked to meat laced with poison which was left around the area.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Essex Police on 101.
