Nestled behind a fence in the suburbs of New York's Brooklyn neighborhood, stands The Wyckoff Farmhouse Museum - the oldest house in the city.

Built in 1652, almost 400 years ago and over a century before the American Revolution, the house now exists as a museum of life in the colonial ages.

It very nearly didn't make it quite this far, when during the 1950s, the house fell into disrepair and was targeted by local vandals. A group of schoolchildren saved it however, having learned about its history from teachers, and enabled it to stand today.

Still standing: The Wyckoff Farmhouse Museum (pictured), located in New York's Brooklyn suburbs, was built almost 400 years ago in 1652, and is now the city's oldest surviving house

Its story begins at a time when New York
 was still jostling with new transplants; Dutch-Americans, enslaved and 
freed Africans and European immigrants, all of whom were mainly farmers.

'Everyone was an immigrant and somehow, everyone co-existed', states James Wyckoff, a distant descendant of the family who first owned it, on a Vimeo film about the building's history. He goes on to point out that New York remains a melting pot of cultures to this day.

The house was built by an illiterate teenage farm laborer called Pieter Claesen Wyckoff, who had just arrived from Europe.

Educational: The house has been altered and restored many times over the course of its lengthy history, and now stands as a museum of what life was like in Colonial times

As it was: The house was built by an illiterate Dutch farm laborer called Pieter Claeson Wyckoff, who had just arrived from Europe to make a new life for himself and his wife Grietie

Mr Wyckoff and his wife Grietie van Nes settled 
in the area, then known as New Amsterdam and now Brooklyn's East 
Flatbush, around half an hour's drive from the center of Manhattan.

He went on to become a successful farmer and magistrate, bore 11 children and now has more than 50,000 descendants.

His house was enlarged, altered, and has switched hands many times over the space of four centuries, but has always remained in the Wyckoff family and maintained its structural foundations.

Humble beginnings: Pieter Wyckoff eventually became a successful farmer and magistrate and had 11 children, resulting in more than 50,000 descendants since

James Wyckoff, who is now on the museum's advisory board, is immensely relieved that local children managed to deter the vandalism which threatened the building during the 1950s. 

'They really saved the house', says Mr Wyckoff.

In 1965 it became the first structure to 
be designated a New York City Landmark and in 1982, it opened to the public, complete with colonial artifacts and an interior set up that mirrors how it might have looked all those years ago.

Family values: A group of local children saved the house from vandalism in the 1950s, ultimately saving the prized historical building so that it could go on to be enjoyed by others (pictured, an unknown previous family)

'Students learn what it was like to live in New Amsterdam in the 17th
 century', Mr Wyckoff explains. 'You didn't have anywhere to escape and play video games.'

If there's one thing he would like visitors to leave the house with, it's a sense of community, he says.

The Wyckoff Farmhouse Museum is owned by the New
 York City Department of Parks & Recreation, operated by the Wyckoff
 House & Association, and is a member of the Historic House Trust.
