The mother of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager shot dead two weeks ago, has said that meeting Attorney General Eric Holder has given her hope that her son might one day get justice.

The sequence of events that led to her son’s death remain unclear, but earlier this week Lesley McSpadden and her son’s father Michael Brown, Sr. paid for an autopsy which concluded that their son had been shot six times, twice in the head.

The shooting has triggered days of rioting reflecting long-simmering racial tensions in a town of mostly black residents and a majority white police force and McSpadden has admitted that she didn't have faith in local authorities.

‘Up until yesterday, I didn't,’ she told CNN on Thursday.

According to McSpadden, a private meeting with Attorney General Eric Holder, the top law enforcement official in the country, who visited Ferguson on Wednesday helped change her mind.

‘Just hearing the words come directly from (Holder's) mouth, face-to-face, he made me feel like, one day, I will,’ she said. ‘And I'm not saying today, or yesterday, but one day, they will regain my trust.’

Michael Brown’s shooting has prompted multiple investigations and Holder came to the Missouri town to check in on the federal civil rights investigation.

According to McSpadden, Holder promised her ‘that it will be a fair and thorough investigation.’

‘You can read a person. And when you're looking at them and they're looking at you in your eyes, it puts some trust back there,’ she said.

That civil rights investigation will require proof that Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson exhibited 'racial hostility' in the shooting of Brown.

Holder said on Thursday that the incident had opened a national conversation about 'the appropriate use of force and the need to ensure fair and equal treatment for everyone who comes into contact with the police.'

A grand jury is hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson, 28, who has policed the St. Louis suburbs for six years, should be charged in Brown's death. 

Those grand jury proceedings, lead by St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, could lead to an indictment against Wilson. He has said the case could continue into the fall.

McSpadden has said that she did not believe that those those pressing her son's case will be able to achieve justice as she defines it - with Wilson being charged in her son's death.

Many Brown family supporters have demanded that McCulloch be taken off the case, given his relationship with the African-American community and their claims that he is biased toward law enforcement.

McCulloch has said he has no intentions of removing himself from the Michael Brown case, and on Thursday he urged Gov. Jay Nixon to once and for all decide if he will act on calls for McCulloch's ouster.

Some question McCulloch's ability to be unbiased since his father, mother and other relatives worked for St. Louis police. His father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect.

Nixon said this week he is not asking McCulloch to recuse himself. But McCulloch called for a more definitive decision, saying Nixon 'must settle this issue now.'
