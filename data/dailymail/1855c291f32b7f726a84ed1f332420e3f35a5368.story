Every Tory man risks appearing sexist, causing harm to the party’s re-election hopes, a senior Conservative MP warned tonight.

Bernard Jenkin said even David Cameron was guilty of ‘unconscious slights to women’, including  greeting a leading businesswoman by asking where her husband was.

Too often Conservative men think female colleagues can be left to deal with ‘women’s issues’, while ‘men get on with running the country’.

Criticism: Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said every man in the party had to change their attitude towards women

Women have deserted the Tories in the last three years because they think he is out of touch and too posh, a damning survey revealed last month.

After securing a five-point Conservative lead among female voters at the last general election, the party has now slumped to 13 points behind Labour.

Former Tory frontbencher Mr Jenkin called
for a ‘zero-tolerance’ approach from the party on sexism, warning Mr 
Cameron that he must ‘be on this 24/7/365’ and not just at the time of 
reshuffles.

The Prime Minister’s shake-up of 
middle-ranking ministers this week saw several women promoted, including
former TV presenters Esther McVey and Anna Soubry.

Mr Jenkin warned: ‘Every man in the Conservative Party needs to change or be left behind. The leadership needs to be on this 24-7-365, not just at re-shuffle time.’

Writing in the House magazine he adds: ‘Many of us Tory men tend to feel that “women” can deal with “women’s issues”, so men can get on with running the country.’

The Quad of the four most senior ministers are all men – Mr Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne, Deputy PM Nick Clegg and Treasury minister Danny Alexander.

The National Security Council is ‘overwhelmingly men’ and the Tory High Command, including Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne and strategist Lynton Crosby are all men.

Mr Jenkin went on: ‘Only three out of 25 on the Party Board are women. Most of the advisers and policy wonks are men. And of course, most MPs will continue to be men.

‘It is going to take a long time to change all this, so what else must we change? We should look at how we all behave.’

Mr Jenkin recalled how at a dinner to discuss prospects and tactics in the marginal seats, host Lord Ashcroft was asked by a woman MP about declining Conservative support amongst women.

The peer replied: ‘Shut up and sit down!’

Mr Jenkin went on: ‘He was trying to make a joke, of course, but the need to make a joke speaks volumes about the anxiety provoked by the question.’

Janet Daley, a journalist at the Daily Telegraph, has claimed she and a female colleague were ignored at a briefing by an advisor to the Chancellor ‘as if we were pieces of furniture rather than sentient beings’.

Mr Jenkin wrote: ‘And the Prime Minister greeted a leading high profile business women who happens to be the wife of a major donor to the party, by asking, “And where is [x – the husband]!?”

‘We men are all guilty of such unconscious slights to women, but women voters see it and feel it.

‘A business change programme would involve zero tolerance of such behaviour. We have perhaps yet to understand what “change” in the Conservative Party really means.

‘It is not something the leadership does, or women can do for us.’

The Conservatives have repeatedly launched attempts to woo the female vote, hiring advisers dedicated to developing policies which appeal to women.

But the increase in Labour’s popularity since 2010 has been fuelled by women abandoning Mr Cameron in favour of Ed Miliband.

Three years ago 36 per cent of women backed the Tories, compared to 31 per cent for Labour.

But a new Ipsos Mori survey for Mumsnet shows only 29 per cent now support the Conservatives, with Labour up to 42 per cent. The gap is three times large than among male voters.

Labour has a 25 point lead among women aged 18-34 and 21 points among 35-54 year olds.

Adding to the Tory woes, Labour is even ahead among the most affluent women who might be expected to back the Tories.
