Rail commuters can expect the price of some tickets to rise by as much as 5.6 per cent next year.

Campaigners say fares are rising four times faster than wages and that the system used to calculate price increases is ‘discredited’.

The January 2015 rise for regulated fares, which include season tickets, will be based on the RPI inflation figure for July 2014 which is published on Tuesday.

Feeling the pinch: Commuters at London's Waterloo station. Some fares will rise by as much as 5.6 per cent

The price-rise formula is RPI plus 1 per cent, which would mean average fares going up 3.6 per cent if RPI remains at its June 2014 level of 2.6 per cent.

But there is also a ‘flex’ rule that allows train companies to raise some regulated fares by a further 2 per cent as long as the overall average remains at the RPI plus 1 per cent level.

This means some fares could rise by around 5.6 per cent in the new year.

In his 2013 autumn statement, Chancellor George Osborne pegged the regulated-fare rise equal to RPI while reducing the ‘flex’ rule from 5 per cent to 2 per cent.

He will now face pressure to make a similar announcement in his statement this year.

The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) said fares had gone up 20.4 per cent over the lifetime of this Parliament, with the increase likely to be around 24.7 per cent when the January 2015 rise takes effect.

That compared to wages rising at 6.9 per cent over the past four years, said the CBT, with the cost of commuting now taking up as much as a fifth of some passengers’ annual salaries.

It said: ‘Fare changes are determined by a discredited measurement. The RPI is deemed to over-estimate inflation.

‘Our research has shown that the Government’s practice of linking regulated fares to RPI rather than the more accurate CPI measure has cost commuters hundreds of pounds over the last decade.

It added: 'Many commuters live in marginal constituencies, where MPs should be aware that unsustainable fare increases during this Parliament could persuade people to vote for change in May’s general election.'

Unions forming the TUC’s campaign group Action for Rail will be holding demonstrations at rail stations across the country on Tuesday.

Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the RMT transport union, said passengers were 'being lined up for an inflation-busting increase in their fares'.

The RMT is angered that the Northern Rail company has axed some off-peak early-evening tickets on some routes.

Mr Cash said: 'You can bet your life that other train companies will seize on the move by Northern Rail to abolish off-peak fares, clobbering the travelling public with a double whammy that will hit them hard in the pocket while the train companies are laughing all the way to the bank.'

A Department of Transport spokesperson said: 'No decisions on fare rises for 2015 have yet been taken.

'We understand people’s concerns about the cost of travel and the impact this has on family budgets. That is why for 2014 we reduced average fare rises to RPI plus 0 per cent for the first time in a decade.'
