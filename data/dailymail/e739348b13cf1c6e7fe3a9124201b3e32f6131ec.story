Up to half of Britain’s forces in Afghanistan will come home next year after the Americans announced plans to speed up withdrawal by a year.

Downing Street confirmed that British troops will no longer lead combat operations by the end of 2013, handing command responsibility to local Afghan forces 12 months earlier than expected.

Plans have now been drawn up to cut the force of 9,000 British troops by at least 4,000 next year, with a series of steady drawdowns in troops throughout the year.

Previously, David Cameron has said that British forces will no longer be in a combat role by the end of 2014, but ministers had failed to spell out that the handover to Afghan commanders will begin much earlier than that.

Falling back: British troops will retain a supporting role

Sacrifice: Jack Sadler was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan in 2007. His father Ian described as 'devastating' a leaked report which reveals the Taliban are set to return to power

Trooper Jack Sadler was repatriated to RAF Lyneham five days after his death in December 2007

Under the plans outlined yesterday, 
British forces in Helmand Province will begin handing control to Afghan 
generals in mid-2013 and sole control to them by the end of 2013.

They will continue in a reduced 
fighting role during 2014, providing logistics, engineering and air 
support, but with growing numbers of troops withdrawing from 
confrontation with the Taliban to conduct training.

The accelerated timetable was 
revealed by U.S. defence secretary Leon Panetta, who said America would 
wind down combat operations in 2013.

He said: ‘Hopefully by the mid to 
later part of 2013, we’ll be able to make a transition from a combat 
role to a training, advise and assist role.

'It doesn’t mean we’re not going to be combat-ready…[but] it’s not going to be a kind of formal combat role that we are in now.’

Mr Panetta’s choice of words caused 
some irritation in London, and No 10 yesterday sought clarification from
the White House about President Obama’s intentions.

Poised: A Taliban militant holds a grenade launcher in Herat. A secret U.S. report - The State Of The Taliban - claims the insurgent movement is poised to regain control of Afghanistan when Nato troops withdraw

Unbowed: The document claims Taliban fighters are being supported by Pakistan intelligence services across the border

Senior sources in London said the timetable was being driven by the presidential elections in both America and France.

British officials indicated that the UK will co-ordinate its pullout to go along with the American timetable.

The announcement follows the leaking of a confidential report that reveals that the 
Taliban are set to return to power when British and Coalition forces end
their combat role.

Despite
10 years of fighting by Nato forces and their huge sacrifices - 397 
members of the British military alone have been killed and thousands 
wounded - the report says that in the past year there has been 
unprecedented interest, even from within the Afghan government, in 
joining the Taliban.

And it 
points accusingly at Afghanistan's neighbour Pakistan, a key ally of 
Nato, where powerful elements in the security and intelligence services 
support the Taliban and describes how insurgent leaders maintain homes 
within the heart of the capital Islamabad.

Based on 27,000 interviews with over 
4,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners, the detailed report effectively 
questions the Coalition’s own assessment that it is winning the war in 
Afghanistan.

The report - The State of the Taliban -
was described as ‘devastating’ by former soldier Ian 
Sadler, whose son Jack, a 21-year-old reservist serving with the 
Honourable Artillery Company, died in a roadside bomb blast in Helmand 
in December 2007.

Attacks: An explosion after an airstrike in Nanagarhar, Afghanistan. The report, based on interrogation of insurgents, claims Taliban fighters are being given weapons and training by Pakistan-backed militants

Cost: The remains of Private First Class Cody R. Norris arrive at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. More than ten years after the U.S.-led conflict in Afghanistan, the Taliban are poised to regain control

'It has been a waste of time operating
in the way that the British have,' he said, 'Hearing details of the 
report makes me wonder why our soldiers were sent there in the way they 
were and the cost that has been paid.'

The report compiled by U.S. forces 
describes how weapons and vehicles given to Afghan forces have in turn 
been passed on to the Taliban and says that Pakistan's feared 
Inter-Services Intelligence Agency (ISI) is actively colluding with the 
insurgents by actually directing attacks.

'Pakistan knows everything,' the report states, 'they control everything. The Taliban are not Islam. The Taliban are Islamabad.

'ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad (holy war) and expulsion of foreign invaders from Pakistan.

'The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban.

'ISI is thoroughly aware of Taliban 
activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban personnel. Senior 
Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on 
strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of 
Pakistan.'

Those questioned, including senior 
Taliban commanders, told how Islamabad uses a complex network of spies 
and intermediaries to provide strategic advice to aid the Taliban in 
fighting the coalition.

No confidence: An Afghan border police officer receives his graduation certificate. There are concerns that the police, security forces and Afghan army will not be able to maintain order in the country when Nato forces leave

Unpopular: The Taliban is playing on public opinion of President Hamid Karzai's government

Explaining why new recruits are 
turning in large numbers to the Taliban, fighters said : 'When the 
Karzai government was established, we thought there was a chance of 
something good. The harassment, corruption and abuse are unbearable. We 
chose to fight. We chose the Taliban.'

In a bleak conclusion, it paints a 
picture of Al Qaeda’s influence diminishing but the Taliban’s influence 
increasing, stating : 'Afghan civilians frequently prefer Taliban 
governance over the Afghan government, usually as a result of government
corruption.'

The report has evidence that the 
Taliban are deliberately hastening NATO's withdrawal by reducing their 
attacks in some areas and then initiating a comprehensive 
hearts-and-minds campaign.

The findings could heap further 
pressure on David Cameron, and U.S. President Barack Obama, as they face
strengthened calls to withdraw troops before the 2014 deadline.

It could also reinforce the view of 
Taliban hardliners that the group should not negotiate peace with the 
U.S. and President Hamid Karzai's unpopular government while in a 
position of strength.

Significantly, the Taliban said that reports they were about to begin talks with the Karzai 
government in Saudi Arabia were untrue.

'The unfortunate reality is that this 
is a failure of the allied strategy in Afghanistan. They have not been 
able to achieve the goals they set out to achieve,' said Mahmud Durrani,
a former Pakistan army general and ambassador to Washington.

Fresh accusations of Pakistani 
collusion with the Taliban are likely to further strain ties between 
Western powers and Islamabad, which has long denied backing militants 
seeking to topple the U.S.-backed government in Kabul.

Critics say Pakistan uses militant 
groups as proxies to counter the growing influence of rival India in 
Afghanistan. The belief that Pakistan supports the insurgents is widely 
held in Afghanistan.

Pakistani fighter jets bombed the hideouts of two militant commanders along the Afghan borderrecently, killing up to 31 insurgents.

One of those killed was reported to be a Pakistani Taliban leader in the Orakzai region, Moin ud Din.

The strikes followed clashes between soldiers and militants over a strategic mountain in Kurram last week, in which more than 60 people were killed.

In recent years, the Pakistani military has launched a series of offensives against militants in the border regions - which are only nominally controlled by the central government.

Large areas remain under the effective control of extremists, who use the region to plan attacks in Pakistani cities and Afghanistan.

Gunmen also attacked a Pakistan paramilitary checkpoint in the Marwah area of Baluchistan province last night, killing six troops.

And the bodies of seven unarmed men were discovered near the checkpoint.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina 
Rabbani Khar on a one day visit to the Afghan capital Kabul, dismissed 
the claims which she said were not new and could be disregarded.

'This is old wine in an even older 
bottle. I don’t think these claims are new. These claims have been made 
for many, many years,' she said.

In Brussels, a Nato official said the 
prisoners also claimed that the Taliban retain wide public support 
throughout Afghanistan, particularly in the countryside.

The official, however, cautioned that 
the document was not based on any intelligence analysis of the situation
on the ground, but is a summary of thousands of interrogation reports.

'It's a very lopsided perspective because some of them are motivated to portray the picture in their favour,' said the official.

The extent of Taliban support from 
within local forces was underlined yesterday when an Afghan soldier shot
and killed a Nato service member in southern Afghanistan.

It was the sixth report since December
of an Afghan soldier turning his weapon on the international troops 
working to train the Afghan security forces.

Two weeks ago, an Afghan soldier 
killed four French soldiers prompting President Nicolas Sarkozy to speed
up the exit of French troops from Afghanistan said it would ask Nato to
hand over all combat operations to Afghan forces in 2013 instead of by 
the end of 2014.

At least seven British soldiers have 
been killed by so-called trusted 'colleagues' while there have been at 
least 35 attacks on international troops since 2007 by Afghan soldiers, 
police or insurgents wearing their uniforms. The number rose sharply 
last year to 17, up from six in 2010.

Tory MP John Baron, a member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee and a long-term opponent of the Government's 
policy on Afghanistan, said: 'This confirms what a number of us have 
suspected for some time.

'The Taliban insurgency is intact, it 
is supported by local people and it is getting help from the Pakistani 
intelligence services. This proves that the Taliban will not be beaten 
and recent offers of talks should be positively responded to and taken 
up by the U.S. and UK.

'It is possible to talk and fight at the same time - we proved that in Northern Ireland.'

Mr Baron, who believes it is vital to 
find a political solution in Afghanistan, said the military campaign had
become bogged down in 'mission creep' because it did not have clear 
goals.
