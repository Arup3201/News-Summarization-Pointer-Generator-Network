A Louisiana pastor was fatally shot as he preached to a crowd of more than 60 during a revival service.

Pastor Ronald J. Harris Sr. was preaching at about 8:20 pm on Friday at Tabernacle of Praise Worship Center when he was shot
twice by former deacon Woodrow Karey.

Mr Karey entered the church as Mr Harris was 
preaching to over 60 churchgoers and 'walked up to him and shot him at close range,' officials said. The pastor was then shot a second time after falling to the floor.

Mr Harris was pronounced dead at the scene.

Sixty-five people were inside at the time, including the victim's wife, said Chief Deputy Stitch Guillory

The disillusioned former deacon let the church four years ago, according to Mr Harris' daughter, who added that her family is 'puzzled' by his motives.

Mr Karey, 53, of Lake Charles, LA., has charged with second-degree murder and is being
held in the Parish jail Saturday, according to officials.

Officials arrested Mr Karey a block from the church and soon found two guns in a nearby wooded area - one was a shotgun, the other a .22-caliber pistol.

Karey has no known criminal history.

Investigators are interviewing witnesses and trying to establish a motive. The interrogation of Mr Karey is also ongoing.

Family members who answered the telephone Saturday at the Harris home in Lake Charles said there would be no comment. There was no answer at a telephone listing for Karey or at Tabernacle of Praise.
