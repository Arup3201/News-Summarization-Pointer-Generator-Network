Toni Tattis knows the grief of miscarrying a child. In fact, it is something she has experienced five times over.

So when the Hunter Valley mother-of-two heard the New South Wales government was for the first time acknowledging miscarried children by giving parents the option to obtain a certificate of recognition for their loss, she was over the moon.

Ms Tattis has had five miscarriages and lost a set of twins just days after they were born.

Toni Tattis, 38, has had four miscarriages and lost two sets of twins just days after they were born. She is pictured here with her 'miracle baby' Isabella (pictured with Ms Tattis above) who is now 9 years old

Drawing from these experiences, she is now helping other parents cope with their grief. 

The now 38-year-old lost a baby boy at 11 weeks in May 2001 when she was 25 years old.

This child, who she later named Rhys, was her first miscarriage.

In November of the same year she lost baby Jordyn at nine weeks and then in April 2002 her dreams of becoming a mother slipped away again when she lost a set of twins, Cooper and Kaitlyn. Heartache returned in May 2004 when baby James passed away five weeks after she fell pregnant.

Amid these tragedies, Ms Tattis gave birth to twins Jacinta and Madelin - only to lose them after they were born in November 2003. Jacinta lived for two hours and Madeline passed away after three days. They were born 24 weeks into Ms Tattis' pregnancy.

She has since had two healthy children, 'miracle baby' Isabella, 9, who was born in 2005 and Arlie, 19 months, in 2013.

Her girls, Jacinta and Madelin, died in November 2003

Her first husband, Tim Tattis, is the father of Isabella and her lost babies, and her fiance Warren Cooke is father to Arlie.

'For me, my very first loss on its own was quite devastating and distressing for me because I didn't know anyone who had experienced loss [like this],' Ms Tattis, who lives in the Hunter Valley, told Daily Mail Australia.

'All my sisters had healthy pregnancies and I was the oldest. 

'The main thing I felt was very lonely and isolated, and there were no online support groups - in essence - I had to deal with it on my own.'

To add to her times of grief, Ms Tattis said some of her friends did not see her loss as a real loss.

She stressed her close family and friends were very understanding and helped her cope with the death of her children.  

'Miscarriage loss is looked at by quite a few people as not quite a big deal, it's not a baby that you've lost,' Ms Tattis said.

'That expectation that parents should move on quickly, that doesn't happened in reality. 

'You can't just switch a button and say it's all good. That puts a lot of pressure on us, and they do feel that loneliness and isolation.

The names of her lost children - Rhys, Jordyn, Cooper, Kaitlyn, Jacinta and Madeline and James - are in a framed picture as she remembers them every day. She would grief for them forever

'[Some people] think we weren't really attached these babies so early into the pregnancy, but the love and the future are all embedded in them and is there from the moment we find out about the baby.

'The big issue is that there's still a perception that these babies aren't real babies, they're not treated as a full-term birth. They are different. 

'But a loss is a loss and I don't know why we need to minimise it this much. They have a beating heart and you can't question that.'

Despite it being a few years since the deaths of her children, Ms Tattis said she would spend her whole life grieving for them.

'We invest in these [miscarried] babies... and when they are taken from you it doesn't make a difference when the pregnancy is lost. 

'I will always be a mum to these babies and I will carry them in my heart forever.

'Even though I'm living my life, I never forget their birthdays. There is always something special I usually do for them on their birthday like I do for my two living children because they are my children.'

Fortunately Ms Tattis now has two children named Arlie, 19 months, and Isabella, 9. On the left, Ms Tattis is pictured with her children and fiance Warren Cooke who is Arlie's father

From her first-hand experiences, Ms Tattis knew the New South Wales government's move to introduce certificates of recognition for miscarriages would help grieving parents cope with the death of their child.

'[When I heard] I was absolutely ecstatic, I was so emotionally overwhelmed. I wish it was available to me back then,' she said.

'This validation and acknowledgement from the government is going to shape the perception among the community and help those families grieving for their baby. 

'Acknowledgement goes a long way helping parents heal and work through their grief. 

'To be able to speak of their name and acknowledge their life is music to the ears of their parent.'

Ms Tattis has welcomed the NSW government's move to introduce a certificate of recognition for miscarriages

Ms Tattis said naming her lost children had helped her move forward with her life.

'When I did I felt a big weight come off my shoulders... I wish I had done it in the beginning,' she said.

The move from NSW comes after Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory have done the same.

The certificate of recognition was introduced just before Christmas last year but Attorney-General Brad Hazzard made the announcement on Monday.

A miscarriage involves a child that is carried for less than 20 weeks and is below 400 grams. 

'Families who experience the loss of a baby early in a pregnancy have a difficult grieving process and often feel that their loss isn't recognised,' Mr Hazzard said.

;Until now it has not been possible to receive formal recognition for the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks.

'At the request of the Government, NSW Registry of Births, Death and Marriages are issuing optional recognition certificates to parents who have experienced this tragedy.

'The recognition certificates are not legal documents but it is hoped that, at least in some small way, a formal recognition certificate will help.' 

It is also available to parents who lost a child before the introduction date.

Partnered with raising her two children, Ms Tattis is also co-founder and vice-president of Bears of Hope - a group dedicated to assisting parents to deal with their miscarriage.

'What has helped me through the years of loss, loneliness and depression [is] having the opportunity to speak about my babies with other bereaved parents, co-founding and managing Bears Of Hope and writing children's books,' she said.

'Turning the absolute heartache into helping others has been beneficial in my own healing.'
