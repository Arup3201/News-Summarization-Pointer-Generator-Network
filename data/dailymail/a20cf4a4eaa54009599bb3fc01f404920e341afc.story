A known radical Islamist was today arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder a French soldier - and images of the man suspected of carrying out the attack an hour earlier have been released.

The home of the 22-year-old, who has not been named, was raided by armed anti-terrorist police in La Verriere, a commuter town near Versailles, in the early hours of the morning.

Images believed to be of him were caught on CCTV around the time of Saturday’s attack in Paris's La Defense business district. He can be seen carrying a shopping bag believed to be filled with knives he had just purchased.

The attack left Cedric Cordiez, a 23-year-old soldier, with wounds to the throat and neck after a man plunged a sharp instrument into him.

The French ambush happened just three 
days after British soldier Lee Rigby was allegedly hacked to death by 
two Islamists near Woolwich barracks in south London – prompting fears 
of a copycat attack.

Manuel
Valls, France’s interior minister, said the Paris ambush appeared to be
an ‘act of terrorism’ and today he praised his security forces for the 
swift arrest.

Mr Valls said everything would be done to establish the ‘course, the environment and the motivation of this young man’.

A
source close to the investigation told Le Parisien newspaper that the 
man was a follower of a ‘traditionalist’ form of Islam, who had been a 
‘radical [for] three or four years’.

The aim of the enquiry was to establish ‘at what moment he had taken on a Jihadist project’.

Until now, the suspect has only been known for ‘minor acts of delinquency’, notably minor thefts.

Mr
Cordiez was released from hospital on Monday but was still 
‘traumatised’ by the ambush, which happened while he was on an 
anti-terrorist patrol.

Detectives
confirmed that there were ‘high quality images’ of a ‘tall, athletic 
bearded man’ of  North African origin praying near the crime scene.

They also conducted DNA tests after finding a bag near the crime scene with a box cutter, and a sheath for a second knife.

Mr Cordiez’s girlfriend said he was in a state of shock and bolted upright in his hospital bed when a nurse came in during the night, convinced it was his attacker ‘come to finish the job’.

France has been on high alert for attacks by Islamist militants since its military intervention against Islamist rebels in Mali in January, which prompted threats from AQIM, the North African wing of al Qaeda.

The latest warning was published on YouTube a few weeks before gunmen this week attacked a military base and a French uranium extraction site in the central African state of Niger, killing 24 soldiers and one civilian.

Last year Mohammed Merah, a 23-year-old French-Algerian Islamist, murdered three French soldiers near the south west city of Toulouse.

He carried out a killing spree which also claimed the lives of four civilians.

Merah was brought up on the same kind of immigrant housing estate as the one where this morning’s arrest was carried out.
