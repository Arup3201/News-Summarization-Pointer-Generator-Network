The European Tour season finished in Dubai on Sunday, but it appears the hard work may have just begun for  Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose.

Before the pair begun competing in the season-finale World Tour Championship, Race to Dubai winner and world No 1 McIlroy uploaded an image of him lifting a huge weight.

It did not bypass the attention of his fellow Ryder Cup and previous US Open winner Justin Rose, who felt inspired by his good friend off the course to get down the gym himself, albeit with a slight difference.

Rose was tied second for the tournament on 14-under, as was McIlroy, two behind winner Henrik Stenson

Rose's post, where he jokingly challenged McIlroy to beat what he was lifting, did not distract either from finishing their seasons in style in Abu Dhabi.

Both players finished tied second, two shots behind winner Henrik Stenson, another member of the victorious Ryder Cup team at Gleneagles.

But McIlroy collected the enourmous Race to Dubai trophy at the end of the tournament, and would have needed all the strength gained from his intense workouts as he held it for the cameras.
