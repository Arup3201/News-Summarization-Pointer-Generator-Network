The Block apartment designed by this year's contestants, sisters Alisa and Lysandra, has been seized by federal police as possible proceeds of crime.

The twins' luxury unit was purchased by Lukas James Kamay, a NAB banker charged with carrying out an alleged insider trading scam worth $7 million.

The 26-year-old successfully bid $2.375 million for the three bedroom inner-Melbourne apartment in April, $616,000 above its reserve price.

The Australian Federal Police and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission have frozen the $500,000 deposit he put down for the 47 O'Grady Street property, among other assets, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The MailOnline understands Alisa and Lysandra will still receive their winnings.

Kamay and Christopher Russell Hill – an employee of the Australian Bureau of Statistics – are friends from Monash University and are accused of making net profit of $6.98 million over eight months by insider trading using advanced knowledge of government data.

Hill, a 24-year-old Canberra-based ABS employee, allegedly gave Kamay information about official data releases on jobs, building approvals, capital expenditure and retail sales.

Kamay allegedly offered Hill $50,000 to give him the ABS data and would use this information to 'predict fluctuations in the Australian dollar'.

Hill was arrested for offences relating to insider trading and extradited to Victoria

He would buy foreign exchange derivative contracts minutes before the ABS's data release at 11.30am and would sell them shortly afterwards.

The men were arrested on Friday and charged with offences relating to insider trading, money laundering, corruption and abuse of public office.

Kamay and Hill's alleged scam first caught the attention of Owen Kerr, a foreign exchange broker who works at online currency trading firm Pepperstone Financial, where Kamay was a client.

In September last year one of Mr Kerr's employees noticed their client Kamay was making large bets on the Australian dollar moments before ABS data releases at 11.30am.

Mr Kerr searched for Kamay using his gold LinkedIn account and saw that he was connected to ABS employee Hill, The Australian Financial Review reported.

Mr Kerr then realised Kamay was using a 'man on the inside' to trade on ABS data.

His tip off lead to a joint AFP and ASIC surveillance operation called Operation Leith, which was carried out with the cooperation of Pepperstone, the ABS, NAB and Kamay's second broker Axicorp.

'Kamay was taking quite decent size positions which were larger than his account size could sustain if they went the wrong way, so they were really an all or nothing bet and not something someone would normally rationally make,' Mr Kerr said.

'He would trade just before the announcements. The earliest they would get in was half an hour but mostly three to five minutes or sometimes even 30 seconds.'

NAB and the ABS monitored Kamay and Hill at work, tapping their phones and taping them using surveillance video.

Early on Friday, the AFP and ASIC executed eight search warrants at both of the men's properties and arrested the pair in the process.

Included in the items seized was $9,000 in cash.

Kamay, based in Clifton Hill, was charged with offences relating to corrupting a public official and using inside information to unlawfully profit from positive foreign exchange derivatives.

Meanwhile Hill, based in Belconnen, was charged with abuse of public office, releasing sensitive information, receiving a corrupt benefit and insider trading.

‘The AFP and ASIC have worked together closely on this serious and complex investigation, utilising the resources and expertise of both agencies to bring about today's arrests,’ AFP Acting National Manager Crime Operations Ian McCartney said.

‘Investigations like this send a clear message to anyone who is thinking of engaging in this type of criminal activity - we have the ability to monitor you and take action, as we've done today.’

The luxury apartment is located in Albert Park in inner-city Melbourne

'The outcome of today's operation is a testament to the close working relationship and cooperation between the AFP and ASIC, and the dedication and expertise of the teams involved,' ASIC head of markets enforcement Chris Savundra said.

The National Australia Bank and Australian Bureau of Statistics fully cooperated with the investigation.

When phoned for comment, a spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police said no further charges would be brought against the pair.

The men, who were university friends, are fronted court in Melbourne and Canberra on Friday.

A producer for The Block told MailOnline they could not comment as the matter is before the courts.
