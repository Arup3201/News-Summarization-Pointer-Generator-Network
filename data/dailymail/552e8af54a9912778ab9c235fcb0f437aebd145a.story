A 74-year-old marathon runner believes a technical error is behind his apparently miraculous performance in the second half of the London Marathon.

Veteran runner Frank Staples set off on the grueling 26-mile race shortly after 10am on Sunday, April 13, official race statistics show.

He managed to reach the halfway point in a time of around three and a half hours, crossing the midway line at 1:28pm.

Frank Staples appears to have completed the second half of the London marathon in under half the time he took to complete the first half

Race records show Mr Staples set off at 10am, reached the half way point at 1.30pm but had finished by 2.45pm

But, according to race records, Mr Staples then ran an incredible second half of the race, completing the last 13 miles in just one hour and 14 minutes.

The time would not be out of place in an Olympic marathon, with former British women's champion Paula Radcliffe only seven minutes faster in her 2003 World Record run.

Mr Staples has denied he had cheated and insisted the extremely fast second half time must be down to a technical problem.

He told The Sun: 'I don't remember there being mats to record times. I can't explain it, but it's not my fault.'

Mr Staples (centre left) crossed the finish line with a time of four hours, 39 minutes - but his second half performance would have been good enough to keep up with Paula Radcliffe

His overall time of four hours, 39 minutes made him the 15,281st runner to cross the finishing line near Buckingham Palace, the official website states.

Retired insurance broker Mr Staples, of Great Somerford, Wiltshire, has run more than 30 marathons including New York, Boston, Sydney and Hawaii since taking up running in the 1980s.

A member of London's Serpentine running club, he has even taken part in runs in the Arctic, Antarctic and on Mount Everest.

Jason Scotland-Williams was accused of cheating after, like Mr Staples, his record only showed estimated times for 25km, 30km and 35km

It comes after another runner, Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, was accused of duping race officials after he completed the second leg of the marathon in just one hour, one minute - three minutes shy of the world record.

It was alleged Mr Scotland-Williams jumped the barrier separating the 13-mile marker from the 22-mile point and hid in the crowds while runners looped round Canary Wharf and doubled back.

Like the online record for Mr Scotland-Williams' run, Mr Staples' record only gives estimated times at the 25km, 30km and 35km markers â€“ suggesting he either missed out those checkpoints or that his chip failed to activate at those points.

A spokesman for Virgin London Marathon has said they are investigating 'a number of discrepancies' in runners' times.
