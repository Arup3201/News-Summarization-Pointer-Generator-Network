An accident that resulted in the tragic deaths of two Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) workers is being investigated by the National Transport Safety Bureau (NTSB).

Union officials have named the two deceased as Chris Sheppard, a BART worker and member of the AFSCME union and Larry Daniels who was a contract worker, according to ABC.

The two men were killed when a train on a routine maintenance run hit them as they performed track inspection.

The
accident in the East Bay city of Walnut Creek occurred shortly before 
2pm on Saturday as the train was on a routine maintenance operated by non-union 
staff members, Bay Area Rapid Transit officials said in a statement.

BART
officials said an 'experienced operator' was at the controls, but did 
not specify who it was. The train was being run in automatic mode under 
computer control at the time of the accident, the statement said.

The NTSB held a media briefing Sunday about the ongoing investigation into the deaths.

'My concern coming out here, as it is with every investigation, is to find out what happened, gather the facts,' said NTSB Investigator-in-Charge Jim Southworth.

'And on scene, that's all we'll do is gather the facts. We'll make the measurements, we'll open every door, we'll spread out the expertise that we'll get from the parties, and we'll look at very single part of what went on out here and make a determination as to what happened.'

On Friday, BART employees went on strike for the second time in four months over union demands for shorter workdays and overtime pay.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the two unions representing BART workers had warned of the safety risks if managers were allowed to operated the trains during work stoppages.

'The managers may very well have been train operators at one time, but still it's a bit of a struggle to come up to speed on short notice,' Des Patten, a spokesman for Service Employees International Union Local 1021, said in a phone interview.

One of the BART workers who was killed was a member of the AFSCME union who had crossed the picket line to return to work.

Investigators have not said who was at the controls of the train when the deadly incident occurred.

They will be examining video recordings from inside the trains to see who was in the cabin at the time of the accident.

They'll also be looking into the training and safety records of individuals operating that train.

Inside Bay Area published the radio transmission that was made moments after the accident.

The
train operator said: 'BART emergency! BART emergency to Central! We 
just struck some individuals [at a track location] ... Central be 
advised it may be BART employees.'

Later, he said: 'Both are deceased and definitely BART employees.'

According
to a statement from BART, the two workers were performing track 
inspections and both had 'extensive' experience working around trains.

The inspection procedure requires that one person inspect the track and the other act as a lookout for oncoming trains.

It is unclear if the two BART workers were following this procedure.

BART
said the train was being run by an 'experienced' operator who was shuttling graffiti-covered cars to be cleaned. It was in 
automatic mode and under computer control at the time of the accident.

The bodies of the two deceased were spaced about 160 feet apart from each other on the tracks.

According to ABC, union officials are holding two Sunday night vigils for the victims.
