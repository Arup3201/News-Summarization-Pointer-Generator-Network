As one of Hollywood's greatest sex symbols, she was known to have a turbulent private life.

Now, Marilyn Monroe's love letters - and bizarrely, one of her bras - are being put up for auction in Beverly Hills, California.

The letters, penned by the actress and her lovers, including playwright Arthur Miller and baseball great Joe DiMaggio, are among 300 items to go on sale as part of 'Marilyn Monroe's Lost Archives'.

Other artifacts include a 19-minute reel of a movie made for Monroe after her final picture, 1961's 'The Misfits', in which the star is seen frolicking happily at the beach with her co-star, Clark Gable.

For sale: Marilyn Monroe's love letters - and bizarrely, one of her bras (pictured) - are being put up for auction as part of 'Marilyn Monroe's Lost Archives' at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills, California, next month

Personal: The letters, penned by the actress and her lovers, including playwright Arthur Miller and baseball great Joe DiMaggio, are among 300 items to go on sale. Above, a 1954 letter from DiMaggio to Monroe

Couple: One letter, written by DiMaggio (seen with Monroe) when the star said she was filing for divorce, reads: 'I love you and want to be with you. There is nothing I would like better than to restore your confidence in me'

They also feature the actress's white bra, a framed letter from costume designer Cecil Beaton, a Dior black silk dress and a fawn-colored silk overcoat with a black velvet collar.

With regard to the love letters, one written by DiMaggio when Monroe announced she was filing for divorce after a matter of months in 1954 reads: 'I love you and want to be with you'.

It continues: 'There is nothing I would like better than to restore your confidence in me.'

DiMaggio, a famously stoic and private man, was pictured crying at Monroe's funeral in 1962 and for the following two decades, had flowers placed at her crypt several times a week

Never before seen: Another letter (pictured) in the collection - which will go on sale at Julien's Auctions next month - is from Monroe to her third and final husband, Miller, in which she muses about her insecurities

Romance: 'Please, if I've ever made you cry or made you even more sadder, ever for a second, please forgive me, my perfect girl. I love you,' Miller (pictured with Monroe) wrote in a  P.S. in one letter back to Monroe

In his letter, addressed to 'Mrs Joe DiMaggio and mailed special delivery, he wrote that he learned Monroe was leaving him only when he saw her make the announcement on television. 

'My heart split even wider seeing you cry in front of all these people,' he penned.

Another  letter in the collection - which will go on sale at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills next month - is from Monroe to her third and final husband, Miller, in which she muses about her  insecurities.

Others are from Monroe's friends, such as Clark Gable, Cary Grant and Jane Russell; with the latter imploring the actress in 10 handwritten pages to give her marriage to DiMaggio another chance.

Elegant: Other artifacts include a framed letter from costume designer Cecil Beaton and a number of items of clothing, including this fawn-colored silk overcoat (pictured) with a black velvet collar and apricot satin lining

'It really gives you the chills when you read some of the stuff and see the intimacy and the personal nature of it,' said auction curator Martin Nolan, who spent nine months organizing  the collection.

Auction owner Darren Julien said the pieces could fetch more than $1million, citing a watercolor that Monroe painted with the aim of giving it to President John Kennedy.

The artwork sold for $80,000 at an estate auction nine years ago.

Monroe's 'collectability' has skyrocketed in recent years, driven in part by deep-pocketed Asian and European collectors with a fondness for American pop-culture artifacts, Mr Julien said.

The fact that the centerpiece of this collection is not just celebrity tchotchkes but deeply personal artifacts is also expected to fuel interest.

'We anticipate a lot of fans will be here. They'll fly in from all over the world,' said Mr Julien, who will display the items at his gallery for four days before they go on the block on December 5 and 6.

Monroe, who died of a drug overdose at age 36 in 1962, willed 'The Lost Archives' to her mentor, the legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg. He gave it to a friend he trusted would take proper care.

That friend's family, which Julien said wants to remain anonymous, obviously met Strasberg's expectations. Many of the letters look as pristine as the day their authors wrote them.

Old: This photo shows a three-page handwritten letter and original envelope that was sent from DiMaggio to Monroe postmarked October 9, 1954. It is among 300 items to go up for sale at the auction in Beverly Hills

'Please, if I've ever made you cry or made you even more sadder, ever for a second, please forgive me, my perfect girl. I love you,' Miller wrote in a pencil-scribbled P.S. at the bottom of one letter.

In a reply to one of his missives, Monroe takes issue with what the author of 'Death of a Salesman' had called her nobility in handling a difficult childhood followed by public adulation that nearly crushed her.

'In other words, there was no choice to make, the same road was always before me,' she wrote. 'So for you to speak of my nobility, it really wasn't so noble.'

She went on to say: 'It's doubly difficult to understand that you, the most different, most beautiful human being, chose me to love.'

Never sent? This single-page handwritten letter  is presumed to have never been sent from  Monroe to  Miller

Speaking of the many letters Monroe received from her admirers, Mr Nolan said: 'It's fantastic to see how loved she was.'

He added: 'Like you thought she was vulnerable and not loved and she craved love and she needed that reassurance. But she had it. She had it with Joe DiMaggio. She had it with Arthur Miller.'

And, so it seems, she still has it with much of the rest of the world.
