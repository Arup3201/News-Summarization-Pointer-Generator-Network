Tim Sherwood admitted this defeat in his first match as Aston Villa manager was one of the lowest moments of his career, but insisted his current group of players will escape relegation.

The contrast with Sherwood’s buoyancy at his unveiling last Monday could not have been starker.

Victor Moses’s penalty in the third minute past the 90 sapped the joy from Villa Park, on a day that became one of Sherwood’s worst. ‘Yeah, it’s low, I’m low,’ he said.

The match was heading for a draw until Ron Vlaar made the miscalculation that saw Villa slip to a sixth successive Premier League defeat. He brought down Moses in the area and received a red card for his troubles.

So the bounce expected by owner Randy Lerner in appointing Sherwood failed to materialise. Villa actually dropped a place. Their next games, against Newcastle, West Bromwich, Sunderland and Swansea, must yield points.

‘I want them to play a bit more relaxed in the final third, get on the ball and go and express themselves,’ said Sherwood. ‘I think we’ve got a group who are capable of doing that. It’s about delivering on match day.

‘We know we need to improve and we need to start improving very quickly.’

Scott Sinclair did provide cause for optimism. His performance on the left wing was full of energy and his header to open the scoring was dispatched like a striker who has been banging in goals all season.

Sinclair said the squad exchanged heated words in the dressing room. ‘They came in shouting and there was all the stuff you think of when players are angry after conceding in the last minute,’ he said.

Mark Hughes was delighted by Stoke’s fifth away win, aided by Mame Biram Diouf’s equaliser just before half-time. He said Sherwood would get it right. ‘I think they have made a good appointment in Tim. He is a positive guy and that’s what they need,’ he said.
