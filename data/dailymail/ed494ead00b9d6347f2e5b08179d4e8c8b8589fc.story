A man has been charged with hiring a hit man to kill his wife - while he was behind bars.

Jeffery Basey of Houston, Texas is accused of offering $50,000 and $5,000 upfront for a hit man to take out his wife just days before she was set to testify against him in a child indecency case.

Basey, 68, was caught when it was revealed that the man posing as the hit man was in fact an undercover law enforcement officer.

Horrible hubby: Mrs. Basey reported that on August 25 she woke up in bed at her home (above) to find her husband pointing a .38-caliber revolver at her, saying he did not want her to divorce him

ABC 13 reports that the incident occurred on December 23, just before Golda Yvonne Basey was scheduled to testify in court against her husband who was charged in September with three counts of indecency with a child.

Mr. Basey was also charged with violating a protective order taken out by his wife in September four days before he was formally charged with the indecency counts.

This after Mrs. Basey reported that on August 25 she woke up in bed to find her husband pointing a .38-caliber revolver at her, saying he did not want her to divorce him.

Basey's sister meanwhile is the one who reportedly brought the $5,000 upfront payment to the hit man, but officials say she was unaware what the money was for and had no knowledge of her brother's plot. 

Basey will be back in court on Thursday to face these new charges.
