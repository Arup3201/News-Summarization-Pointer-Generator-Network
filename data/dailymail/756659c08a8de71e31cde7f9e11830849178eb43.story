Headway, the brain injury charity, has questioned the application of the Premier League's regulations over head injuries after Thibaut Courtois played on during Chelsea's 2-0 Premier League win over Arsenal on Sunday.

Chelsea goalkeeper Courtois continued after requiring treatment for a head-knock following a collision with Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez, before being replaced after further treatment and departing Stamford Bridge for precautionary scans in hospital.

Headway chief executive Peter McCabe said on the charity's website: 'The new rules introduced this season were designed to ensure no risks to players' health were taken.

Alexis Sanchez immediately shows concern for Thibaut Courtois as the keeper appeared badly hurt

'They clearly state that "If there is any suspicion of the player having sustained a concussion, they must be removed from the field of play, and not allowed to return."

'This incident calls into question whether these rules are working effectively.

'It is hard to understand how a concussion was not suspected following the sickening clash.'

Courtois was taken off only after liquid appeared to be coming from his ear.

McCabe acknowledged the difficulty of making an assessment from television, but questioned why a 'safety-first approach' was not applied.

Courtois suffered a heavy blow when he came out to challenge Arsenal's Sanchez but played on for a while

He added: 'Bleeding from one or both ears is one of the symptoms to look out for that requires an immediate visit or return to hospital following a head injury.

'The fact that the bleeding only became apparent 15 minutes after the injury also demonstrates the evolving nature of concussion and highlights why a safety-first approach must be taken with all head injuries.' 

Chelsea's first-team squad were afforded a day off by manager Jose Mourinho as many of the players prepared to join up with their national teams after the Blues extended their advantage at the top of the Premier League to five points from Manchester City.

Only goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, defender John Terry and striker Didier Drogba, who is currently nursing an ankle injury, will stay behind for training, with all three having retired from international duty.

Eden Hazard leaves for Belgium duty - for which Courtois is also expected to depart - on a high after a mixed start to the season.

The playmaker, who is expected to sign a new contract shortly to commit to Chelsea, was below par against Aston Villa, but sparkled on occasion against the Gunners, particularly in the run which led to the penalty which he converted himself.

Hazard, who was the target of some heavy tackling in the contest, is content to be fouled if it benefits the team.

Belgian winger Eden Hazard said he did not mind being fouled if it helped his side win matches

And he believes with Cesc Fabregas over a set-piece, a goal is always possible.

'When I get the ball I need to go forward and win free-kicks, win penalties,' the 23-year-old Hazard told Chelsea TV.

'If they want to play like this it's not my problem. They have two against me, okay, but I can create a lot of space for other players.

'We can score every game with Fabregas from a free-kick or corner.'

Chelsea have dropped two points in their opening seven games - in drawing at Manchester City - and are top of their Champions League Group.

Hazard knows there is no margin for error, though.

He added: 'We have a strong team. We need to concentrate all the time, 100 per cent.

'We know we have bad moments in one season, but we need to be focused all the time.'

Cesc Fabregas played an key role as he faced his old side Arsenal, providing an assist for the second goal
