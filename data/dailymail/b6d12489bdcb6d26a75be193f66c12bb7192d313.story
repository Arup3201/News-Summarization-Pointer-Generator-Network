An eight-year-old girl has been reunited with her stolen puppy, which she spent three years saving up for.

Izzy Duffy did not spend her birthday, Christmas and pocket money so she could help pay for Skittles, a 14-week-old black and white Shih Tzu.

She was left heart-broken when burglars forced open a ground floor window and took the family’s mobile phones, wallets, games consoles, tablet computers, cameras, and a laptop, before stealing the puppy in its cage.

Skittles was stolen, leaving his young owner Izzy Duffy devastated by the cruel theft

But she has now been reunited with Skittles after she was spotted by two members of staff at a Tesco Express who were closing up and spotted the puppy in the car park, according to the Daily Express.

Her mother Shona, 44, said: 'It's incredible and Izzy is thrilled to have Skittles back.'

The family's BMW X5 was also stolen on the night, but it had very little fuel in it following a family trip to Anglesey and was dumped a mile from their home in Whitworth, Lancashire.

Izzy's dad, Dr Chris Duffy, said she and her six-year-old brother, Alistair, were distraught when they realised the dog had gone.

He said: 'We can replace the property, but this has really hurt the kids.

'Izzy just cried and cried. She couldn’t go to school on the following day because she was so upset.

The family had Skittles micro-chipped and hope a vet will soon identify it and alert the police

'But the school understood because every free choice of work she gets is dog-related, and we had only taken Skittles in the previous week to show all the other children.'

The family had the dog micro-chipped and they had been hoping a vet would be able to identify it and alert the police.

Shih Tzu puppies can sell at between £300 and £600.

Dr Duffy said: 'We had a lovely weekend away and then woke up the next day and were absolutely gutted.'

A spokesman for Lancashire Constabulary said: 'This was a high value burglary and we are determined to reunite the family with their property.

'The family is most devastated about their 14-week-old puppy being stolen and we would appeal to anybody who might know where it is to come forward.'

The burglary comes after police realised that gangs have been daubing signs on properties they want to steal from - and the latest sign being 'K' believed to be a play on the word 'Canine'

The latest incidents of the 'K' code were highlighted by Cheshire Police officers in April who are investigating thefts in Alsager.

Gangs are stealing either pedigree dogs to sell to unwitting buyers online or mutts they can use in illegal dog fights. Pedigree dogs are sold on the black market for up to £2,000 each.

Gangs' most popular targets are trained working dogs, such as Labradors, although other popular types such as Chihuahuas and pugs also figure highly in the list of breeds stolen.

The biggest rise has been in thefts of cocker spaniels, following an increase in popularity after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge adopted a puppy, Lupo.

An RSPCA spokesman said in April: ‘If people are concerned, they should make sure their pets are microchipped, gardens are secure, their dogs are monitored while in the garden and report suspicious activity to police.’
