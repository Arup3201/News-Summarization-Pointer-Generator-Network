Damaging: Intelligence chiefs have lost track of some of Britain’s most dangerous criminals after US Edward Snowden (above) revealed their tactics

Intelligence chiefs have lost track of some of Britain’s most dangerous criminals because US fugitive Edward Snowden exposed security service operations, it has been claimed.

The UK’s eavesdropping service, GCHQ, has had to stop monitoring drug gangs, paedophiles, human traffickers and money launderers as a result of the ‘significant’ damage inflicted by the leaks reported in the Guardian newspaper, sources said.

The Left-wing paper published a series of articles giving details of the activities of US and UK spy agencies, based on the top-secret files stolen by Snowden.

The reports helped to blow a massive hole in Britain’s intelligence-gathering capability by exposing sensitive methods to terrorists. Security chiefs said that extremists were ‘lapping up’ the articles and using them to evade detection.

Now, intelligence sources have warned that more than a quarter of the activities of some of the UK’s most prolific crime bosses are going undetected because they have changed their communications following the revelations.

In other cases, GCHQ has toned down or abandoned surveillance amid fears that the tactics are too easy to spot and could force criminals to ‘go dark’ and fall off the radar completely.

One senior security official told The Daily Telegraph: ‘Snowden has been very damaging to our work. We have specific evidence of where key targets have changed their communication behaviour as a direct result of what they have read. They have moved to more secure forms of communication and we have been unable to assist the National Crime Agency.’

While spy bosses had already told how terrorists changed their tactics after the leaks last year, the latest revelations show that harm was also done to GCHQ’s other remit – combating serious and organised crime.

Among the gangs left able to operate unhindered, the source said, was a drug-smuggling ring which had continued to bring Class A narcotics into Britain.

Snowden, 31, became one of the world’s most wanted men in June last year – less than a month after Lee Rigby’s murder – when he broke cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole classified files from the US National Security Agency. He leaked information about attempts by spy agencies – including GCHQ and the NSA – to view citizens’ private data such as internet history, emails, texts, calls and passwords.

Giving evidence at Parliament last year, Sir Iain Lobban, then head of GCHQ, said the ‘fragile mosaic’ of capabilities that allowed intelligence agents to discover, investigate and take action against terrorists, paedophiles and other serious criminals had become ‘far, far weaker’ because of the revelations. 

Baroness Stowell, the Leader of the House of Lords, said the leaks had had a ‘serious effect on intelligence-gathering – that is unquestionable.’

And in June Theresa May, the Home Secretary, said that the government’s ability to tackle organised crime was being hampered by a decline in the ability of police and intelligence services to access communications data used by alleged terrorists and criminals.

Consequently, Mrs May has announced expanded powers that will allow the police and intelligence services to spy on the internet. The proposed legislation would require internet companies to keep records of every website their customers visited.

Snowden, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into giving him passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in US history. The defence contractor claims he had to act because the US government’s policies were a ‘threat to democracy’. He fled to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location.

Organised crime is thought to involve up to 5,500 gangs and costs the UK £24billion a year.
