British holidaymakers were last night warned to expect less cash in their pockets when they head abroad as the value of the pound tumbles.

Sterling fell to a 16-month low against the euro and a nine-month low against the US dollar yesterday.

Today, the pound at 12pm was at $1.525 compared to $1.530 at the previous close, and the euro was at £0.865 compared to £0.873 at the previous close.

The pound has fallen 5.5 per cent this year against a basket of world currencies – the second worst performance among the world’s major economies behind the Japanese yen.

The slump has pushed up the cost of 
travelling abroad for Britons, with everything from hotel rooms in New 
York to ski passes in the Alps far more expensive.

Analysts warned that the slump was likely to continue in the coming months as Britain teeters on the brink of a triple-dip recession and the national debt spirals higher.

‘The market has sterling in its cross hairs,’ said Gavin Friend, a currency strategist at National Australia Bank in London.

Lee McDarby, an expert at banking group Investec, said: ‘2013 just goes from bad to worse for the pound.’

The pound fell to as low as 1.14 euros against the single currency and to below $1.53 against the dollar on the foreign exchange markets.

Sterling was trading above 1.23 euros early this year and at close to 1.29 euros in July last year – meaning it has fallen 11 per cent in just seven months.

It means that £500 is now worth just 
570 euros compared with the 645 euros a British holidaymaker would have 
got last summer when the pound was at a four-year high.

David
Swann, an expert at foreign exchange group Travelex, said the latest 
slump ‘comes as yet another blow to British holidaymakers’.

He said: ‘For those heading to the 
eurozone, this means they are getting the worst rate since October 2011.
This isn’t great news for cash-strapped Brits.’

The pound has not suffered such an 
aggressive fall since the financial crisis and it is feared the slump 
has further to go as the chances of a disastrous break-up of the 
eurozone recede, at least for now, and Britain’s coveted AAA credit 
rating comes under pressure.

Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at 
trading firm ETX Capital, said: ‘Sterling finds itself under renewed 
pressure as the possibility of a ratings downgrade looms ever larger.

‘If indeed the UK does lose its AAA credit rating, then any last embers of a safe haven type environment, established because of the even weaker performance of rival economies, would likely dissipate, especially if investors decide, rightly or wrongly, that the eurozone and US are finally emerging from the doldrums.’

Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘Sterling’s sharp drop against the euro seems to have reflected markets’ increasing belief that the economic outlook for the UK is broadly as bad as it is in the eurozone.’
