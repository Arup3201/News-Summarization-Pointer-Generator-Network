David Cameron demanded ‘urgent’ action from Brussels last night over Spanish meddling with Gibraltar.

He phoned European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to tell him to send observers to the border immediately, rather than wait until next month as Brussels has suggested.

The Prime Minister repeatedly reminded the chief Eurocrat it is his job to ensure EU law is upheld.

Deputy Premier Nick Clegg, a fluent Spanish speaker, called his counterpart in Madrid, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, to warn that the UK will retaliate politically and legally unless Spain backs down.

David Cameron called on the European Commission President José Manuel Barroso to bring an end to Spanish aggression towards Gibraltar

Mr Cameron has threatened to take Spain to the European Court of Justice 
over its imposition of 'politically-motivated' border checks.

In a show of military strength a task force, including the aircraft 
carrier Illustrious and two frigates, set sail from Portsmouth on Monday
for a long-planned exercise in the Mediterranean.

The frigate HMS Westminster, which 
left Portsmouth this week is due to dock in Gibraltar between Monday 
and Wednesday next week along with two support vessels.

Mr Cameron used a phone call with Mr Barrosa to hammer home the message that British patience is running out.

He said the he had 'serious concerns' about the additional border checks which the UK beleives are 'politically motivated and disproportionate' and therefore contrary to the EU right of free movement.

Despite the offer of 'ad-hoc talks', including the government of Gibraltar, the delays have continued.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 'We are now actively considering legal action and collating evidence on the sporadic nature of these measures which would prove that they are illegitimate.

'In the meantime, we believe that the European Commission, as guardian of the treaties, should investigate the issue and the PM called on President Barroso to send an EU monitoring team to the Gibraltar-Spain border urgently to gather evidence of the checks that are being carried out.

'The PM emphasised that the Commission has a responsibility to do this as part of its role overseeing the application of Union law.'

Checks: Motorists queue at the border crossing between Spain and Gibraltar in La Linea de la Concepcion. Irate drivers waited up to five hours to enter Gibraltar, some even pushing their cars to save fuel

Delays: Traffic builds up on the Spanish side of the border. The Royal Gibraltar Police said the wait had been around three hours

President Barroso insisted that the European Commission is 'closely monitoring the situation' and that, following a thorough legal assessment, they would not hesitate to take any measures necessary to uphold EU law.

However, a Commission monitoring body is not expected to visit the border until next month.

Meanwhile Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is to call his Spanish counterpart Soraya Saenz de Santamaria to 'reiterate our concerns and to press for a way forward to de-escalate the issue'.

Tensions have mounted in recent weeks
in a dispute over Spanish fisherman accessing Gibraltar waters, which 
has seen Madrid impose draconian border checks which have caused huge 
queues.

The Royal Gibraltar
Police said drivers had to queue for around three hours on Tuesday to 
enter Gibraltar, although there were no delays leaving. Some motorists 
said they were kept waiting five hours.

Gibraltar's chief minister accused Spain’s prime minister of behaving like Argentine dictator General Galtieri.

Fabian
Picardo said Mariano Rajoy was fuelling the crisis to distract from his
domestic troubles – just as the military junta in Buenos Aires did by 
ordering the invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982.
