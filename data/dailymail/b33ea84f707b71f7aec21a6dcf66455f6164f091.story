An army Captain who led a doomed reconnaissance patrol at the start of the 2003 Iraq War claims his unit was 'abandoned and betrayed' by military chiefs after the mission went disastrously wrong.

David Blakeley, 33, has broken almost a decade of silence to reveal how his nine-man patrol became surrounded by hundreds of Iraqi troops from Saddam Hussein's feared Republican Guard.

Travelling in lightly-armoured Land Rovers, his pathfinder unit had been sent to assess an airfield hundreds of kilometres north of British positions to determine if it was suitable for an airborne insertion of paratroopers.

Although they had been given intelligence reports claiming the area was free from enemy units they found it was actually swarming with hostile troops.

Realising they were trapped, they called in for air support but were told nothing was available. Their only option was to fight their way out.

After numerous skirmishes with the enemy they eventually made it back, their vehicles riddled with bullet holes. The unit earned two Military Crosses.

Army code requires that soldiers never reveal details of such operations to the public and for nine years Captain Blakeley kept the disastrous mission a secret.

But he has now revealed all in a new Book Pathfinder: A Special Forces Mission Behind Enemy Lines.

Captain Blakeley, who was injured in a later mission but recovered before leaving the army, claims he felt compelled to speak out in a bid to prevent any similar disasters in the future.

He told the Independent newspaper: 'We were massively outnumbered. We were abandoned and betrayed by higher command.

'I think it is the biggest secret of the war.

'I know I am going to get some snipes from people who think I should have kept quiet. It has been a lonely journey but morally it was the right thing to do.

'The key reason was to learn lessons from the mistakes.'

Captain Blakeley's team of six Pathfinders and three Royal Engineers were sent across the American front line to Qalat Sikar airfield - 120km north of Nasiriyah in the south east of the country.

Nasiriyah had seen the US Marine advance thwarted and 29 men lost after they encountered unexpectedly strong resistance from the Republican Guard.

As they reached the city, the Brits, in their three Land Rovers armed with six machine guns, had just 12 hours to complete their mission.

They quickly moved across the front line encountering dozens of shell-shocked American Marines and soon found themselves surrounded by enemy forces and fire from all sides.

Realising they were boxed in from all sides they decided their only option was to call for air support.

Captain Bleakley explained: 'I was told instantly by a senior officer there was no air.

'It was like swallowing acid. It was crushing, devastating.  We were totally on our own, abandoned.'

After fighting their way back through five ambushes, they finally arrived at the American position where they passed on grid references of all the Iraqi units  they had encountered.

Captain Bleakely added: 'The mission had failed but we had done our damnedest.

When I thought of these amazing guys and what we had contributed to the intelligence picture, I was shaking with anger.'
