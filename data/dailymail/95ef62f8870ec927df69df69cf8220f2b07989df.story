As Anthony Weiner's 
floundering mayoral campaign rambled on Friday, posters began popping up
around New York City mocking the disgraced candidate's public relations
woes.

The comedy website Funny or Die posted images of a hilarious mock ad seeking interns for Weiner's campaign.

According
to the posters that are widely believed to have been concocted and 
plastered around Manhattan by Funny or Die humorists themselves, the 
embattled mayoral hopeful is seeking staffers who are not 's***bags,' 
'snitches' or 'cops.'

Silent: Anthony Weiner yesterday refused to comment on his controversial spokeswoman Barbara Morgan

Hasty retreat: The mayoral candidate climbed into a waiting SUV without answering reporters' questions

Under 'qualifications', the authors of
the fake wanted ad listed, among other skills, 'organized and 
details-oriented, discreet and no gag reflex,' the site Red Alert Politics reported.

'For
more information, report to the loading area behind the docks at 
sundown and make sure you are not followed,' the printed sign 
instructed.

The bogus 
flyers are a play on comments made by Weiner’s Communications Director 
Barbara Morgan, who reportedly called former intern Olivia Nuzzi a 
'f***ing s***bag' and 'fame-hungry b****' for publishing an expose 
about her experience working for Anthony Weiner. 

What's going on here then? Anthony Weiner can't resist playing with his cell phone while he supposed to be canvassing for votes

The candidate's mayoral campaign ran into trouble last week when it was revealed that he had been sexting women for a year after the Twitter scandal which forced him to resign from Congress.

It took a turn for the worse on Tuesday when Ms Morgan responded to criticisms of the campaign made by former intern Olivia Nuzzi, calling her a 't***' and a 'c***'.

Mr Weiner attended an event organized by the Friends of Rockaway Beach with three other mayoral candidates on Wednesday night as he attempted to get past the controversy.

He answered three audience questions before saying, 'God bless you' and walking out of a side door.

Rant: Ms Morgan, pictured with Mr Weiner last week, described Ms Nuzzi as a 'fame-hungry b****'

Troubled: Mr Weiner at a campaign event in Queens last night, where he attempted to boost his chances of being elected mayor of New York City

The candidate was chased by 15 reporters - ignoring the event's other speakers - and ran into a waiting SUV.

Members of the press shouted out, 'Where's Barbara?', but did not get a response.

Also on Wednesday, the would-be mayor ran into more trouble when he was spotted checking his cell phone during a campaign event, serving as an additional reminder of his sexting scandal.

The 48-year-old was a popular congressman for Queens for more than 12 years, and had been tipped for higher office before he accidentally tweeted a photograph of his crotch which he had intended to send to a woman who was not his wife.

Initial polls in the Democratic primary election for mayor of New York showed Mr Weiner in a strong position against frontrunner Christine Quinn, but his support has collapsed since the revelation that he carried on sexting under the pseudonym 'Carlos Danger'.

Apology: Ms Morgan posted this picture on Twitter after she hit the headlines this week

Criticism: Ms Nuzzi, pictured, claimed that Mr Weiner's campaign was badly run and ineffective

Ms Morgan, the campaign's communications director, has not been seen in public since her expletive-laden tirade against Ms Nuzzi was published by Talking Points Memo on Tuesday.

Yesterday she took to Twitter to apologize, posting a photograph of a swear jar filled with bills and credit cards.

'Not my best day yesterday,' she wrote. 'Should've known better, been better. Gotta pay up.'

In a statement, she said: 'In a moment of frustration, I used inappropriate language in what I thought was an off-the-record conversation. It was wrong and I am very sorry, which is what I said tonight when I called and emailed Olivia to apologize.'

Ms Morgan was angry with Ms Nuzzi for posting an article in the New York Daily News suggesting that many of Mr Weiner's staff had only joined his campaign to get close to his wife, Hillary Clinton's adie Huma Abedin.

She also claimed that one employee had left because he had only been paid a third of what he was promised, and that the candidate incorrectly referred to her and other interns as 'Monica'.
