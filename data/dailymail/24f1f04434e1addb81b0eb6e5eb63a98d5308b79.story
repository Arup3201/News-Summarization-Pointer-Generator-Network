Arsenal and Liverpool each paid £16million for a striker with something of a point to prove in the closing stages of the transfer window.

Danny Welbeck arrived in north London with a reputation for hard work, level temperament, a little skill, pace, power, and questionable finishing.

Mario Balotelli landed on Merseyside with a reputation for not much hard work, erratic temperament, a lot of skill, pace, power and cool finishing, at least from the penalty spot.

But already, with Wednesday night’s Champions League action as Exhibit A, the evidence suggests it is Arsene Wenger with the bargain on his hands, while Brendan Rodgers perhaps has only trouble, greater even than he anticipated.

Wenger had the opportunity to buy Balotelli but declined, while Rodgers had earlier in the summer dismissed the idea totally. Circumstances changed and he must now get the best out of the Italian. Welbeck, meanwhile, has quickly shown he could be better than many thought possible.

Juxtaposing the abilities of the two players born just three months apart shows why.

Work rate

This is the defining quality that separates Welbeck from Balotelli. Too often a backhanded compliment for players not as talented as others, it is actually the difference between winning and losing.

Welbeck will run all match for his team, while Balotelli often looks like he’s not overly keen to stride a few yards. At Manchester United, that willingness meant Welbeck would be asked to play on the wing rather than up front.

It is also why Sir Alex Ferguson gave Welbeck the job of No 10, under instruction to target and tackle Xabi Alonso, when Real Madrid visited Old Trafford in March 2013.

Can you imagine Rodgers requesting a similar, thankless task of Balotelli? It would be harder than convincing George Clooney to take a role as a supporting actor in a blockbuster film. Rodgers could not even persuade Balotelli to applaud travelling Liverpool fans following defeat in Basle.

Finishing

Following Welbeck’s first goal for Arsenal against Aston Villa, Wenger explained his belief that an instinct for finishing had ebbed during years spent on the edge of stage at United. When every shot is scrutinised because of their infrequency, confidence can sap.

This is not to absolve Welbeck for misses – indeed his attempted dink when through against Manuel Neuer last season stands out as a particularly galling episode – but it goes some way to contextualising 20 goals in 92 Premier League for United (39 appearances were from the bench).

As he showed in his hat-trick against Galatasaray, Welbeck actually possesses the tools to score plenty. His first for United, as a 17-year-old, was a thunderbolt from range, while the 'Welbeck heel' for England against Sweden at Euro 2012 expressed ingenuity.

Balotelli has never suffered from a shortage of bravado. Sorting his famous ‘Why always me?’ T-shirt ahead of the Manchester derby shows as much. His finishing has mostly backed that statement up. From 12 yards he is pretty much invincible – recent lapses in Italy failing to puncture his perfect record in England – and there is no doubt he possesses the mentality of a goalscorer.

He makes the difficult look simple, as with his only Liverpool goal to date against Ludogorets, and has a knack for finding the extremities between the posts. His record for Manchester City of 20 Premier League goals in 33 starts bears scrutiny with the best.

Attitude

A tale of two mindsets. Where Welbeck is the ultimate team player, Balotelli is the ultimate maverick. Moves will often link through Welbeck, who set up Mesut Ozil in the win at Villa Park, and he showed his willingness to run beyond the shoulder of the last defender against Galatasaray. He may want that centre-forward role dearly, but his time at United shows he will not shun an order to sacrifice himself for the greater good.

Sacrifice is the word Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher could not countenance when discussing Balotelli. His psychology is attuned to individual glory, as much as he may be a likeable figure in the dressing room. Given the lone forward role in Basle, he regularly dropped deep in search of the ball when he would have been better suited providing an outlet further up. 

There was not a single touch in the opposition box, but two cracked free-kicks from distance – admittedly very good – and a shot slashed horribly wide when team-mates offered better choices.

Flair

This is an area Balotelli should excel over Welbeck but any footballer schooled in United’s academy since the age of 11 will have a sure touch. Welbeck can dribble and perform a drag back as well as anyone in the division.

Balotelli holds all the tricks in his locker but utilising them for best impact is a talent he is yet to master. Just remember that Zidane turn when through on goal in a pre-season friendly for City. Roberto Mancini hooked him straight away.

Fans rating

Arsenal supporters were initially uncertain about Welbeck, even if they did delight in capturing a player United’s faithful had called their own. That Spurs were gazumped also added to his allure. But any doubts are beginning to be dispelled and virals celebrating Welbeck have flooded social media, ever the gauge of a footballer’s popularity.

Liverpool followers will always want to unite behind their players and even though Balotelli was once a thorn in their side, hundreds of fans flocked to the club’s Melwood training base the night he conducted his medical, cheering as he left past 9pm. That initial excitement has turned into realisation that he is not the Messiah, however, just Mario (and sometimes he can be a very naughty boy).

Competition for places

So far Welbeck has enjoyed the run of the Emirates with Olivier Giroud injured. It will be interesting to witness his reaction, and Wenger’s, when the France striker returns from his foot problem in January. 

He might have sealed his starting role as centre forward by then if he carries on like he is. Lukas Podolski can play up front but is out of favour, while Theo Walcott is another who wants to play striker but is currently injured. Finally Welbeck is the main man in possession of the shirt.

It is a similar situation for Balotelli at current. Daniel Sturridge has been superb since arriving from Chelsea in January 2013 but has a frustrating habit for getting injured. He has been out with a thigh strain since the start of September. Once fit, he could force Balotelli to the bench, with Raheem Sterling and Adam Lallana for support instead.

Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are Rodgers’ other striking options but neither is setting the world alight at Anfield. Lambert hasn’t scored in five substitute appearances in the Premier League, while Borni has managed to stick around despite everyone’s best efforts to get him to Sunderland. 

He did score 10 times on loan on Wearside last season but only twice for Liverpool the campaign before.
