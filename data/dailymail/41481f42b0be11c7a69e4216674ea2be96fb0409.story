A new sex toy featuring an in-built camera aims to help women perform health checks and watch for any changes that could indicate an STI or health problem.

The technology, which was created by Svakom, a U.S.-based company, claims to give women a 'multi-sensory' experience, while allowing them to keep a check on their health.

The Gaga, as it is known, aims to provide pleasure with information.

The design comes with a USB charger cable for a laptop or smartphone app allowing women to perform personal check-ups.

The Gaga can also be controlled by another person using its wireless app.

With a recent survey revealing women are more likely to research embarrasing health symptoms online, rather than book an appointment with a GP, the importance of self-inspection cannot be underestimated.

The new technology aims to help women learn what is normal for them, and look out for any abnormal changes, which could imply a health problem or STI.

The Gaga, which costs $180 - around £105 - is the first vibrator of its kind.

Svakom has been making toys since 2006, 
and its main focus is on design, research, development, manufacturing, 
and sales of sex toys around the world.

On
 their website, they claim that the Gaga is their ' most innovative 
design that combines pleasure while allowing you to capture the most 
intimate moments and explore the most intimate parts of the body.'

'Intelligently designed with a subtle light and built in camera lend at the tip, Gaga will allow you to experience please like you never have before, both visually and through the sensation of vibration.'

It also purports to be made using 100 per cent green terotechnology and have the fastest recharging in the industry.

The first known vibrator was invented in 1880 by Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville to cure women of 'hysteria'.

The vibrator, the first of its kind, costs $180 and is sold by Svakom, an international sex toy company
