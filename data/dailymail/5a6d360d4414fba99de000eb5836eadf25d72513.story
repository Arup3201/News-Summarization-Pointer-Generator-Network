They may look like creatures from another universe, but these multi-coloured sea slugs are in fact one of the marvels of our oceans.

Nudibranchs are soft-bodied marine molluscs that shed their shells after their larval stage, revealing their brightly-coloured exteriors.

These stunning images were captured by 
wildlife photographer Franco Banfi in some of Earth's most exotic waters surrounding 
Indonesia, the Phillippines, Papua New Guinea, the Mediterranean and the
 Red Sea.

These alien-like creatures can be found in oceans all over the world

Nudibranchs shed their shells during the larval stage to reveal these multi-coloured exteriors

It is believed the soft-bodied marine molluscs have evolved their unique anatomy to warn off predators

These images were taken in waters surrounding Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, as well as the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea

The name 'nudibranchs' derives from Latin and Greek and means 'naked gills'

The name derives from the Latin for naked, nudus, and the Greek for gills, brankhia.

In most species the gills are prominently displayed on their dorsal surface.

Scientists believe they may have evolved such extraordinary anatomy as a form of camouflage to mimick their surroundings and avoid predators.

Another theory is that they are an example of aposematism, an attempt to warn potential predators that they could be poisonous to eat.

Even their egg masses are often red, pink, orange or any other colour depending on the species.

In tropical waters, beachwalkers can find nudibranchs in tidal pools at low tide.

One theory is that the colourful exterior is a form of aposematism - a warning to predators that they could be poisonous

Another theory is that their bright colouring helps sea slugs blend into their surroundings

Wildlife photographer Franco Banfi travelled around the world to capture these beautiful images

There are thought to be around 3,000 different species of nudibranchs in our oceans

Nudibranchs live on all levels of the ocean but their greatest size and variation comes in warm, shallow waters

Some nudibranchs have toxins which can render their predators incapacitated

Some species get their toxicity from the sponge they eat but others can produce it themselves

Another defence tactic is for nudibranchs to release acid from their skin

Nudibranchs are among the most beautiful and diverse creatures to be found on the planet

In most species, the gills are prominently displayed on their dorsal surface

Some species can also release toxins which render their predators incapacitated and allow them to escape.

Others can release acid from their skin when irritated.

There are more than 3,000 described species of nudibranchs and they occur in oceans worldwide including both tropics and Antarctica.

They can be found crawling over rocks, seaweeds, sponges, corals and many other substrates

They live in all levels of saltwater but their greatest size and variation occurs in warm, shallow waters.

Sea slugs have tentacles on their heads which they use to find food and seek a mate

They can be found crawling over rocks, seaweeds, sponges, corals and many other substrates

Sea slugs are found all over the world, including the British Isles, the tropics and even the Antarctic

Nudibranchs are hermaphrodites which means that they possess both male and female sex organs

Even sea slug eggs can be red, pink, orange or any other colour depending on the species

Beachwalkers can often find nudibranchs in tidal pools at low tide
