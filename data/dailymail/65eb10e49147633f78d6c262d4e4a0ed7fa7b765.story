The Duchess of Cornwall has visited a Fleet Street chapel honouring newspaper staff who gave their lives serving in the two World Wars

The Duchess of Cornwall has visited a Fleet Street chapel honouring newspaper staff who gave their lives serving in the two World Wars.

Camilla was greeted at St Bride’s – the journalists’ church – by its rector, Canon Alison Joyce. 

The duchess was attending in her capacity as Patron of the Guild of St Bride’s, which was formed in 1375.

During the visit, Viscount Rothermere, chairman of the Daily Mail and General Trust, and his wife, Lady Rothermere, gave her a tour of the Rothermere Memorial Chapel for Associated Newspapers War Dead. 

The medieval crypt was uncovered during the restoration of St Bride’s after wartime bombing, and was later reconstructed with money from the Rothermere family.

Engraved glass in the chapel records the names of the Associated Newspapers employees who fell in the First and Second World War, including Lord Rothermere’s great grandfather’s two sons, Vyvyan and Vere.

The Duchess was pictured in front of the Welsh slate cross which hangs in the chapel.

She also met some of the Guildsmen of St Bride’s and saw the Journalists’ Altar in the church which serves as a memorial table to the many journalists and support staff who have died while reporting on the conflicts of the 21st century.
