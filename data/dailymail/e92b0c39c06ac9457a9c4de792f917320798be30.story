Yaya Toure vowed to remain at Manchester City on Friday despite months of seemingly trying to drive a wedge between himself and the champions.

‘I want to stay,’ said the Ivorian midfielder. ‘I will always honour my contract. I don’t think about all this speculation. It’s a big pleasure to stay and enjoy the next season. The fans have always been good to me.’

His agent Dimitri Seluk, who had spent the whole summer manufacturing alleged conflicts with City, added: ‘Everybody can stop speculating about this.

BORN: May 13 1983 (age 31)

2001-2003: Beveren (70 apps, 3 gls)

2003-2005: Metalurh Donetsk (33, 3)

2005-2006: Olympiacos (26, 3)

2006-2007: Monaco (27, 5)

2007-2010: Barcelona (74, 4)

2010-NOW: Manchester City (134, 38)

2004-NOW: Ivory Coast (83, 16)

Any speculation, of course, was entirely of the player’s making after he and his agent cultivated an image of a man unloved by his club and open to a move.

In May, Seluk claimed Toure was ‘very upset’ that the club did not present him with a cake for his 31st birthday and also alleged that on a trip to Abu Dhabi, the club’s owners did not shake Toure’s hand.

Seluk then asserted that it was ‘50-50’ whether the midfielder would remain at City next season, even though his contract runs until 2017.

Toure, meanwhile, fluttered his eyelashes at Paris Saint-Germain and admitted a yearning to finish his playing days back at Barcelona. 

Following Ivory Coast’s exit from the World Cup, Toure — who had, in fact, been presented with two birthday cakes by City — made some rather more damaging allegations, suggesting the club did not allow him compassionate leave to spend time with his terminally ill brother Ibrahim, who died last month.

It is understood that City, who have always adopted a sensitive and paternal approach to players’ personal issues, offered Toure their full support, even helping with the funeral arrangements and overseeing the paperwork for the Toure family, after previously welcoming Ibrahim as a special guest at Carrington.

City, for their part, have remained relaxed throughout. They recognise that Toure has been through a traumatic period following the death of his brother and they insist there have been no rows between the player and the club.

Privately, they maintained that they would not countenance the departure of a player who earns in the region of £250,000 a week and last season scored 24 goals as City reclaimed the Barclays  Premier League crown. 

City head to the United States for their pre-season tour early next week but Toure, along with the other players knocked out in the group stages of the World Cup, will have an extra few days off. 

Meanwhile, Patrick Vieira, the coach for City’s elite development squad, suggested that ‘a lack of pure talent’ was the primary reason for England’s worst World Cup performance in 56 years. 

‘For all the people who love England and love English football like I do, it was very disappointing,’ said the French World Cup winner.

‘The problem is more in the grassroots than in the club teams. I think it’s a lack of pure talent.’
