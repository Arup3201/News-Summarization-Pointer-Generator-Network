Crackdown: Last month Mashudur Choudhury became the first Briton to be prosecuted under terror laws for arranging to travel to Syria to join a jihadist training camp

Ministers are 
preparing a tough new crackdown on ‘foreign fighters’ who import their 
fanaticism back to the UK.

The
 Queen’s Speech on Wednesday will include plans to target the estimated 
400 extremists with British links who have travelled to Syria since the 
conflict began. 

As the law 
currently stands, only terror-related activities which take place in the
 UK can be criminalised – meaning that British nationals who use a 
foreign base, such as Syria, to plan attacks on the UK can escape 
prosecution.

Under the new 
plans, the Terrorism Act will be amended so that Britons can be 
prosecuted even if they prepare for terrorist acts while they are 
abroad.

The move comes amid 
growing concern within the Government over the destabilising effect on 
British society of jihadists returning from Syria, which has become the 
leading destination  for Islamic fighters. 

A
 No 10 source said: ‘People who prepare and train for terrorist 
activities should be in no doubt of the action we are prepared to take 
to protect our national security, including prosecuting those who break 
the law.

Our message is clear –  the UK advises against all travel to 
Syria. Anyone who does travel, for whatever reason, is putting 
themselves in considerable danger.’

Last
 month Mashudur Choudhury became the first Briton to be prosecuted under
 terror laws for arranging to travel to Syria to join a jihadist 
training camp.

Choudhury, 31,
 who will be sentenced later this month, was arrested after the police 
were tipped off from within the Muslim community in his home town  of 
Portsmouth.

They received intelligence that Choudhury and four other men
 had left for Syria last October.

The
 men were allegedly inspired to go to the camps after another associate,
 Ifthekar Jaman, 29, travelled to fight with the Al Qaeda-inspired rebel
 groups fighting Bashar al-Assad’s forces last year.

Jaman, who used 
social media to encourage others to follow him, was killed in December.

And The Mail on Sunday today revealed that London-born Ismail Jabbar, 22, has fled his suburban upbringing and travelled abroad to 
become a fanatical terrorist.

Jabbar, a former trainee with the House of Fraser store, is currently fighting for the ‘Unit Bin Laden’ of violent 
Islamic extremists in Syria, where he boasts of killing his enemies.

He also incites fellow Muslims to murder soldiers, police officers and unbelievers back in Britain.
