It was said of another general several millennia ago that he came, he saw and he conquered.

Army chief General V.K. Singh will probably realise too late, that living in a democratic polity the choice of the outcome depended not on his military skills, but the decision of two wise men who had probably never heard a gunshot fired in anger.

In the process, he not only failed to get any redress from the Supreme Court in his dispute over his age, but also lost the moral confidence to continue in office.

Losing battle: General V.K. Singh could now be forced to resign after his claim against the government was rejected

Justice R.M. Lodha and Justice H.L. Gokhale compelled him to withdraw his age row petition before the Supreme Court after saying that it was not inclined to interfere with the government's decision to consider his date of birth in the service records to be May 10, 1950, as against May 10, 1951.

They said that unless the decision was 'perverse or grossly erroneous' it could not be interfered with in a petition under Article 32, which the General had invoked to directly move the apex court against the alleged injustice.

The fact that the age issue had gained such public currency, the question being asked all around was whether the General would now step down.

Speaking to Headlines Today, Lt Gen (retd) Raj Kadyan said that the army chief's position was diminished in the eyes of his contemporaries and his men and it would be best if he resigns.

'I am dejected that he gave up the fight,' he said.

'He should not have withdrawn his petition [and fought on].'

His words were echoed by Major General (retd) G.D. Bakshi who felt that General Singh ought to resign. He said that the army chief had done the right thing by fighting the issue to the bitter end and that he would not be surprised if indeed he resigned.

It is a fact that the entire community of retired military personnel had strongly supported General Singh's petition and that the Supreme Court decision will have major reverberations, especially if General Singh does not step down from office.

Many former military personnel have seen
the controversy as being akin to that faced by the revered Army chief, 
General K.S. Thimayya, in 1959. The then army chief had resigned because
of the interference by the then defence minister, Krishna Menon. But 
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had persuaded him to withdraw his 
resignation, but later humiliated him by refusing to act on the issues 
Thimayya had raised.

For the ex-servicemen fraternity, the Thimayya (who served as chief from 1957- 1961) issue is not history, but a contemporary comment on the shoddy manner in which the political and bureaucratic community has dealt with the uniformed personnel.

The court's position clearly indicated its unwillingness to delve into a quarrel between two important arms of the government - the army and the ministry of defence.

'If it has come to the stage of washing dirty linen, you can do so,' Justice Lodha told the defence counsel at one point.

'But we thought both sides had been dignified and would not cross the line.'

The apex court's position echoed by many in the country was that this was a quarrel that should never have seen public light, and now that it had, it should be swiftly brushed under the carpet. But it was not just a matter of appearances, but of the fact that any order or decision by the court would have become a precedent and could have roiled the issue of the selection and tenure of the army chief.

In that sense, the court felt that it was best if it said nothing. This was, after all, a personal matter relating to a claim of a date of birth. It was not a charge relating to corruption or some other act of criminality which the court would have found difficult to sidestep.

General Singh left for the South Western Command in Jaipur soon after his petition on the date of birth row was withdrawn, signalling that it was business as usual for him and it was left for his aides to speculate that 'anything can happen' on the question if he was contemplating resignation.

Though the government withdrew the order which had been objected to by the court during the last hearing, it seemed to be a lost case for the General the moment proceedings started on Friday.

The Bench kept the General's counsel on the back-foot throughout the hearing by seeking explanations on Singh having himself mentioned the wrong date of birth on more than one occasion, on several documents recording 1950 as his date of birth, on not getting the error rectified within the time-frame set out in the rules and on not abiding by his repeated commitments to treat the matter closed.

The court pointed out that the General had himself given a commitment to accept the decision by the government on the controversy and had accepted 1950 as the year of his birth.

Referring to three letters by the General undertaking to abide by any decision in the interest of the organisation, the court said it was a well thought decision by him as he 'stated, restated and further reiterated' his commitment.

'There may be many explanations for retracting from the commitment…But I do not think it would behove such a meritorious officer to take that position,' Justice Lodha said.

Justice Gokhale, who was harsher, 
said: 'You could have gone to court (instead of agreeing to accept May 
10, 1950, as your date of birth). But you did not and became the chief 
of armed staff.

'You may be
justified in raising a grievance. But this date (May 10, 1950) has been
there over a period of time and last three promotions had been on this 
date,' the Bench said.

He said the court had no doubt he was honestly pursuing the matter and being the army chief he had every right to agitate his grievance before the highest court. He said everyone was proud of him defending the country.

'Judges do what others avoid. We have to take a decision ultimately,' he said, sympathising with him.

The only positive outcome of this sad controversy is that it may compel the government to pay serious attention to the dysfunctional relations between the civilians and the armed forces personnel in the ministry of defence.

Though the government claims that everything is fine, there is a gap which is getting worse by the day. A great deal of responsibility for this lies with the arrogance of the bureaucracy, which lacks the expertise to deal with military subjects and simply lacks an understanding of the military culture and ethos.

Out of time: General V.K. Singh was told that the record of his age had been on file for some time and he had not previously challenged it

Army chief General Vijay Kumar Singh on Friday withdrew his petition on the age row after the Supreme Court indicated that it was not inclined to interfere with the government's decision to consider his date of birth in the service records to be May 10, 1950 as against May 10, 1951.

A bench comprising Justice R.M. Lodha and Justice H.L. Gokhale said unless a decision is 'perverse or grossly erroneous' it could not be interfered with in a petition under Article 32, which the General had invoked to directly move the apex court against the alleged injustice.

The bench, however, observed that it had the highest regard for General Singh and its order should not come in way of the assignment he was holding.

'As the chief of armed services, you continue to serve the way you served (the army) for the last 38 years,' it said.

Referring to other assignments that he might get after retirement, Attorney General G.E. Vahanvati said he hoped and prayed that this was not the end of General Singh's service to the nation. Though the General withdrew his petition, the decision should not be interpreted as a thaw in the relationship between him and the government. This was evident during the fag end of the hearing itself.

On someone suggesting that the court could record in its order that the matter had come to an end following an amicable settlement, Vahanvati said: 'No. There is no amicable settlement.'

Earlier, General Singh's counsel U.U. Lalit, having been pushed to the wall with the court rejecting most of his arguments, stressed that the controversy had arisen because the government perhaps had some succession plan in mind.

'As a counsel, I cannot say certain things that have happened,' he said.

'If it has come to the stage of washing dirty linen, you can do so... But we thought both sides had been dignified and would not cross the line,' Justice Lodha said.

Though the government withdrew the order which had been objected to by the court during the last hearing, it seemed to be a lost case for the General the moment proceedings started on Friday.

The bench kept the Singh's counsel on the backfoot throughout the hearing by seeking explanations on the General having himself mentioned the wrong date of birth on more than one occasions, on several documents recording 1950 as his date of birth, on not getting the error rectified within the time-frame set out in the rules and on not abiding by his repeated commitments to treat the matter closed.

The court pointed out that the General had himself given a commitment to accept the decision by the government on the controversy and had accepted 1950 as the year of his birth.

Referring to three letters by the General undertaking to abide by any decision in the interest of the organisation, the court said it was a well thought decision by him as he 'stated, restated and further reiterated' his commitment.
