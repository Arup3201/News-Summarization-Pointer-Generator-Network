Tragic: 16-year-old Austin Sprout died last December

A couple who face charges for allegedly praying for their son's recovery instead of seeking medical attention for his illness, have been told their six other children are now wards of the state.

Brandi and Russel Bellew face second-degree manslaughter charges in the death of 16-year-old Austin Sprout last December.

Prosecutors said he had been ill at home for more than a week, before dying at the family home in Oregon.

But they may continue to care for their remaining children under a state-supervised 'in-home safety plan,' Lane County Circuit Juvenile Court Judge Eveleen Henry also ruled in a brief afternoon hearing on Monday according to The Register Guard.

It means the couple can still see the children, who are aged from a baby to 17, in their home, but a state 'safety provider' must be present at all times during visits.

The Bellews are forbidden contact with each other 
under terms of their pre-trial release from jail, so they will see the children separately.

Another
term is that if any of the children do become ill, there must be an 
immediate notification to the Department of Human Services.

Both
Bellews were widows, so the children were all born in their previous relationships, except the sixth child who was born once they married.

Brandi's first husband, Brian Sprout, died of sepsis in 2007 after failing to seek medical treatment for a leg injury, a Lane County Sheriff’s Office lieutenant said when the Bellews were arrested in February.

He was the biological father of three of the six children placed in state custody Monday, as well as of Austin Sprout.

Austin
Sprout's uncle, Shawn Sprout told KVAL that the family is part of the 
General Assembly Church of the First Born in Pleasant Hill.

He said the church believes in prayer and healing.

'We trust in God for everything. We trusted him to take care of our illnesses and heal us,' Shawn Sprout said.

Shawn Sprout said Austin's parents gave 
their son the option to seek medical care when he was became ill, but that it 
was the teen's choice not to see and a doctor and receive potentially life-saving treatment. 

In his obituary Austin was said to have loved playing basketball and hunting.

At the hearing on Monday, the room was packed with relatives and supporters the Bellews. 

The Register Guard reported that many appeared to be members of the couple's church who bowed their heads and appeared to pray during the hearing.
