A second military healthcare worker has been flown back to the UK after suffering a suspected needle injury while treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone.

Public Health England today confirmed the worker has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London for monitoring.

A spokesman stressed that at this time 'they have not been diagnosed with Ebola and do not have symptoms'.

It comes after another healthcare worker arrived back in the UK on Saturday for Ebola monitoring amid fears they were exposed to the virus when treating patients in Sierra Leone.

Public Health England (PHE) said the individual has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London for assessment and next of kin have been informed

As with the latest case it is thought that worker was also exposed via a needle-injury. But officials were quick to stress the two incidents are not thought to be related.

PHE said there is no risk to the general public. 

Professor Paul Cosford, PHE's director for health protection and medical director, today said: ''We can confirm that all the appropriate support is being offered to this individual and that strict protocols have been followed to transfer them back to the UK. 

'We would like to emphasise that there is no risk to the general public's health. 

'Our thoughts are with both of the healthcare workers, and their families, affected at this time.'

Both healthcare workers will remain at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead for the remainder of their 21-day incubation periods.

The virus has an incubation period of between two days and three weeks.

The Royal Free has the capacity to assess and monitor the latest returning healthcare worker alongside their colleague, admitted on Saturday. 

Being pricked by a needle is a cause for concern because the virus is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. 

The individual is likely to have been exposed to the virus but has not been diagnosed with Ebola and does not have symptoms. Pictured is the High Secure Infectious Disease Unit at The Royal Free Hospital

There are currently no specific drugs to cure Ebola, nor any approved vaccines to prevent the disease. 

Two experimental vaccines are currently being trialled on human volunteers in the UK, US, Liberia, Mali and Uganda. 

The medics transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in London are currently being monitored and health officials have stressed they have not been diagnosed with the disease.

In the event they do begin to show symptoms they will receive supportive care.

The Royal Free Hospital is the only High Level Isolation Unit in the UK to house two high-security containment beds.

They are located inside isolation 'bubbles' - specially-designed tents with controlled ventilation allowing medics to provide clinical care while containing the infection.

Three other hospitals - The Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Royal Victoria Infirmary and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals - are designated centres for escalation if more patients are diagnosed with Ebola.

There are around 50 other designated Ebola beds at these three centres. 

Initially medics work to re-hydrate patients using oral and intravenous fluids.  

Specific symptoms such as diarrohea and fever are treated directly, to try and improve her chances of surviving.

William Pooley, the British nurse who survived Ebola, was treated with the experimental drug ZMapp.

It is a blend of three laboratory-made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus.

Two US aid workers, Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol were also given the drug after they were infected with the virus while working in Liberia. They too, subsequently recovered.

But experts do not know if those given the drug were saved by it, or whether luck played a part.

Around 45 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment.

Meanwhile at least two other patients treated with ZMapp have died, possibly because help got to them too late.

ZMapp, developed by US biotech company Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, is manufactured in the leaves of genetically modified tobacco plants.  

In September, shortly after being discharged from the Royal Free, Mr Pooley, travelled to the US to undergo a blood transfusion to help an American colleague who was being treated for the virus.

It is thought the blood of those who have survived the disease may contain antibodies, which can prove effective in fighting the disease.

Minister for the Armed Forces Mark Francois, said despite two similar incidents with a short space of time, 'both appear to be unrelated'.

He said: 'Our personnel receive the highest standard of training and briefing prior to deployment, including on the use of the specialised Personal Protective Equipment. 

'On a visit to the country before Christmas I witnessed first-hand the bravery and commitment of the personnel who are doing such a fantastic job in Sierra Leone. 

'Their efforts are deserving of the highest praise and we wish all the best for their 2 colleagues who are now in the UK.'

He stressed admitting the healthcare worker to the Royal Free is an 'entirely precautionary measure', adding the priority is the 'wellbeing of the individual involved'. 

Their family has been informed and 'will receive all possible support from the Government', Mr Francois added.

On Saturday the first military healthcare worker, suspected of coming into contact with the virus via a needle injury, was admitted to the Royal Free.

The injury is thought to have been inflicted while the individual was treating a patient near Sierra Leone's capital Freetown. 

It is thought the medic was working at the Kerry Town treatment centre, 40km from Freetown and that the injury happened within 48 hours of their being flown home. 

That is the window of opportunity to fly someone who has had known exposure to Ebola back to the UK, as they are not yet contagious. 

The virus has an incubation period of between two and 21 days. 

PHE said the individual arrived back in the UK on an RAF flight after being exposed to the virus in a 'frontline care setting'. 

It is believed the military transport, bringing the patient back as a precautionary measure, arrived at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The latest medic is likely to have been flown home in similar circumstances.

The Kerry Town complex includes an 80-bed treatment centre managed by Save the Children and a 12-bed centre staffed by British Army medics specifically for health care workers and international staff responding to the Ebola crisis. 

The patients are being treated at London's Royal Free Hospital (RFH), where British nurses Pauline Cafferkey and Will Pooley were treated in a specialist isolation unit. They were each diagnosed with the disease after helping treat patients in Africa. 

The Royal Free, said in a statement: 'We can confirm that a second UK military healthcare worker has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital today following a needlestick injury while working in Sierra Leone.

'The individual has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital for assessment. 

'The individual is likely to have been exposed to Ebola virus but has not been diagnosed with Ebola and does not have symptoms.'

There is one known case of a British person becoming infected with Ebola following a needle stick accident. 

Geoffrey Platt contracted the virus when he accidentally pricked his finger while taking a sample from an infected guinea pig at the Microbiological Research Establishment at Porton Down in Wiltshire.

The former lab technician fell ill in November 1976, suffering vomiting, diarrhoea and a rash.

He was kept in isolation for 40 days but made a full recovery. 

The World Health Organisation has said the epidemic has killed more than 8,800 people - the majority in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, since last year.

But the crisis is showing signs of abating, the WHO said.

Last week officials said there were fewer than 100 cases in a week for the first time since June.

In the week from January 25 there were 30 cases in Guinea, four in Liberia and 65 in Sierra Leone.

The WHO said the epidemic has entered a 'second phase' with the focus shifting to ending the outbreak.

The first symptoms of Ebola include a fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, a sore throat and intense muscle weakness.

Patients typically develop these symptoms after five to seven days, but can appear between two and 21 days of a person becoming infected. 

After these symptoms develop people experience diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash, and stomach pain before liver and kidney functions deteriorate.

If untreated, Ebola then causes internal bleeding and patients can bleed from their ears, eyes, nose or mouth. 

The first trial of an Ebola vaccine to take place in the region worst hit by the epidemic is starting today in Liberia.

In a densely-populated neighbourhood of the capital Monrovia yesterday musicians launched the clinical trial.

Guests clapped, danced along and nodded as they sang lyrics which explained the purpose and intent of the Ebola vaccination trial. 

The singing was part of a campaign to overcome Liberians' reluctance to embrace the vaccines amid conspiracy theories.

The actual trial begins in the Liberian capital today on the first group of volunteers. 

The vaccination trial is a product of a partnership set up by the governments of Liberia and the United States.

Appearing at the launch event yesterday, Liberian Vice President Joseph Nyumah Boakai said the vaccines are 'very important for Liberia and for the world'.

The vaccines contain a trace of Ebola virus that helps trigger an immune response against the virus, according to a document from Prevail, the acronym for Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia, as the US-Liberia collaboration is called.

Mr Boakai urged Liberians 'to take courage because it is going to work'.

The UN health agency said last week that the three worst-affected countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia - have reported fewer than 100 cases in the past week, for the first time since June. 

The World Health Organisation said the outbreak has killed more than 8,000 people since it was identified in March last year.
