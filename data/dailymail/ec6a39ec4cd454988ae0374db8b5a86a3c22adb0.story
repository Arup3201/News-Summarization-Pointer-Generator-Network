Dozens of historic spitfires set to be dug up after they were discovered buried in the Burmese jungle could be flying again within three years, according to the man who spent 16 years searching for the planes.

British farmer David Cundall, 62, spent over a decade and more than £130,000 of his own money working to track down the aircraft, after being told by a group of U.S. veterans they were buried there at the end of the Second World War.

In January archaeologists will begin digging for the planes so they can be painstakingly packaged up and transported back to the UK for restoration, and Mr Cundall has said he believes the spitfires - which have been underground for 67 years - will take to the skies once more.

At least 36 - and potentially as many as 60 - of the British fighter planes are believed to have been buried in the Burmese jungle towards the end of the Second World War in 1945.

iN 1996 aviation enthusiast Mr Cundall, from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, was told the rare Marx XIV Spitfires were buried there in crates in August 1945. He subsequently spent two years researching the project, eventually gathering eight eye-witness reports backing up the claims.

Surveys undertaken at one of three sites in Burma have indicated the presence of large areas of electrically conductive material around 10 metres beneath the surface of the ground.

The location matches the eight eye-witness reports collected by Mr Cundall, who has made 16 visits to Burma over the years conducting surveys and negotiating with authorities.

His project reached a landmark junction earlier this year when sanctions blocking the movement of military materials in and out of Burma were lifted, according to a report in The Daily Telegraph.

'Hopefully they will be brought back to the UK and will be flying at air shows,' he told the newspaper.

'We have had offers from British companies to restore them and put their logos on them which is acceptable to me.

'It should take two to three years to restore them so we should see something in the next three years or so,' he added.

In all three groups have been given permission to look for the planes, but only Mr Cundall - who eventually located the planes using ground penetrating radar equipment - was able to find anything.

After being led to the area by an eye-witness, the farmer's team dug a borehole and sent a camera down to capture footage of the crates, which were found to be in 'really good condition'.

Mr Cundall has now been given exclusive rights to all three sites under investigation in Burma.

Andy Brockman, the archaeologist leading the January dig, said the team will removing and examining a layer of soil at a time. He said that, whatever the outcome of the project, the team would have a 'cracking story' to tell.

An excavation agreement was signed last month by Mr Cundall, Burma's civil aviation chief Tin Naing Tun and 
the Shwe Taung Paw company boss Htoo Htoo Zaw, Mr Cundall's partner in 
the country

Mr Zaw said at the time: 'This will be the largest number of Spitfires in the world. We want to let people see those historic fighters.'

Mr Cundall's treasure hunt was sparked
in 1996 by a throwaway remark from a group of U.S. veterans who said 
they had once buried Spitfires in the Burmese jungle.

The Spitfires, of which there are only
around 35 flying left in the world, were shipped to Burma and 
transported by rail to the British RAF base in August 1945.

Mr Cundall persuaded the country's notoriously secretive regime to 
allow him to search for the lost aircraft, winning their trust over several 
visits.

number of Far East veterans

He said at the time: 'I’m only a small
farmer, I’m not a multi-millionaire and it has been a struggle. It took
me more than 15 years but I finally found them.

'Spitfires are beautiful aeroplanes 
and should not be rotting away in a foreign land. They saved our neck in
the Battle of Britain and they should be preserved.'

Permission to excavate the planes was granted because of the strengthening relations between London and Rangoon.

In the past year, Burma has turned 
away from the repressive policies of the previous military regime and 
has taken a reforming democratic stance.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 'We 
hope that many of them will be gracing the skies of Britain and as 
discussed, some will be displayed here in Burma.'

Mr Cundall said the government had promised him it would not be making a claim for the aircraft.

A law passed by the British when they 
granted Burma independence in 1948 meant that anything left behind 
automatically became the property of the Burmese government.

Mr Cundall is understood to have struck a deal with the Burmese president to take 60 per cent of the profits.
