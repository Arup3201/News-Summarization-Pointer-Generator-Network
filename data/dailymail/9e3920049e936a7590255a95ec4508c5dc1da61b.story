A passenger has filed a $49,000 (£32,660) law suit against Southwest Airlines after claiming an oversized bag fell from an overhead compartment as the plane prepared for take-off.

Jerry Reinhardt claims that on January 17, 2013, he was seated and waiting to depart Portland for Las Vegas when he was struck by the bag.

The suit, filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court in Oregon, alleges a passenger was trying push a suitcase into an overhead locker before a flight attendant attempted to help. The case, however, fell and hit Mr Reinhardt.

Mr Reinhardt is seeking $10,000 (£6,662) in medical bills due to a compressed disc, $5,000 (£3,331) for lost income and $34,000 (£22,651) for pain and suffering.

The Oregonian reports Mr Reinhardt isn't taking action against the fellow passenger with the bag, but the airline for letting the passenger on the plane with carry-on too big to fit in the storage area,

The suit also claims Southwest didn't train the attendant appropriately to handle such luggage in overhead areas.

Attorney Mark Potter, on behalf of Mr Reinhardt, adds his client has suffered nausea, headaches and dizziness as a result of back and neck muscle injuries.

A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines told MailOnline the company could not comment on the impending litigation.

Southwest's carry-on baggage policy allows one bag not exceeding 10 x 16 x 24 inches and one small, personal item, such as a purse, briefcase, laptop or camera. 

Mr Reinhardt claims Southwest shouldn't have let the passenger on the plane with such a large bag

The Association of Flight Attendants campaigned in 2010 against increased allowances for passengers with carry-on luggage.

A survey of members found 80 per cent of them had been injured in some way in incidents involving overhead compartments.

The survey, over two months, also found half of the member flight attendants had seen items fall from a overhead locker.
