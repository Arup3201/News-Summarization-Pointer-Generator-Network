An entire class of first-graders in Philadelphia was taken to a hospital for examination on Tuesday after a classmate, 6, was found with packs of heroin in their classroom, authorities said.

Police were called to Commodore John Barry Elementary School in the Cobbs Creek section of the city after a teacher saw a girl playing with what appeared to be narcotics, said Tanya Little, a police spokeswoman.

The mother of the 6-year-old and her boyfriend are being questioned by police and their home is being searched, reports NBC.

The Mail Online spoke with the Philadelphia police department who said that the suspect is still being processed but that her identity would be released later today.

Officers discovered 11 bags of heroin in the classroom, some of which may have been opened or chewed on.

'We know that one of the packages clearly looks like it was bitten,' said Philadelphia Police Lt. John Walker.

Little said 20 children were taken to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. None showed signs of injury and all of the children have been released to their parents.

Police said they did not know how the child obtained the heroin.

'Someone has to be liable for this,' Little said.Â 

11 packs of heroin were brought to  Commodore John Barry Elementary School in Cobbs Creek, Philadelphia on Tuesday

A teacher took action as soon as she noticed the situation in the classroom.

'Their teacher did a remarkable job,' Walker said. 'They saw the child with these items. The teacher recognized right away, took control and notified another teacher.'

Police believe that the little girl who brought in the heroin is the only certain one who had contact with the drug.

'The only person who we're sure had contact with the product at this point was the young female that brought it in,' said Philadelphia Police Cpt. John Przepiorka.

'The young girl that brought it in did feel a little dizzy and didn't feel well. So we sent her over to CHOP to make sure she's okay.'

Both the girl and her siblings will be cared for by DHS officials.

A relative of the girl named Tamika Gore spoke to NBC and said, 'She probably found it. I have no idea. I know it ain't come from her house. I know that for a fact.'

The school sent a letter home to parents to notify them that their children may have come into contact with an illegal substance.

'This school is crazy,' said Ayana Hales, a parent of students at Barry Elementary.

'My kids, I want them out of here.'
