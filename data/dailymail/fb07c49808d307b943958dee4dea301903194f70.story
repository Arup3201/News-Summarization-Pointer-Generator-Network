Google Glass is hotly tipped as the future of computing, but initial images of what users can see have been distinctly underwhelming and failed to translate the interactive experience of what the technology can really do.

But now a new first-person video has surfaced which finally gives those of us who have not yet had an opportunity to get our hands on the tech toy a look at what you actually see from behind the glass.

‘I can explain Glass to you all day and tell you what you'll see when you look through it,’ says tech expert Rob Jackson.

The user also speaks to the product and asks for it to find directions to Oriole Park in Baltimore

Rob Jackson, who writes for Android-related review site Phandroid, has put together a video showing people what its like to use Google Glass

‘There's really nothing like putting it on and looking at the display for the first time,’ he adds.

Jackson, who writes for Android-related review site Phandroid, and a friend then fix the headset to a camera which enables the viewer to get a better idea of how the glasses actually work.

He shows the device doing a broad range of tasks including getting directions, recording video, converting currency and having a Google+ Hangout with a friend where they can see and hear each other.

The glasses look impressive but these are rather basic tasks that any smartphone can do, although Jackson predicts bigger and better functionality once the device is commercially available next year and third party developers start creating different applications.

Google's Glass wearable computer is set to go on sale to the public next year - but a growing number of complaints could see it banned in hundreds of public places by the time it launches.

Legal experts are warning of a massive 'legal brawl' over the gadget.

Already users wearing Google Glass eyewear have been told they are banned from strip clubs, cinemas and casinos because their 
owners don’t want them filming there.

In West Virginia legislators tried to
make it illegal to use the gadget while driving - and plan to launch 
another legal attack before it becomes widely available next year.

'This is just the beginning,' Timothy Toohey, a Los Angeles lawyer specializing in privacy issues, told the New York Times.

'Google Glass is going to cause quite a brawl.'

Early 'explorer' versions are being sold for £1,000 ($1,500), although consumer versions are expected to be significantly cheaper.

Piper Jaffray, an analyst firm, 
estimates that wearable technology and another major initiative, 
self-driving cars, could ultimately be a $500 billion opportunity for 
the company.

In the shorter term, IHS, a forecasting firm, estimates 
that shipments of smart glasses, could be as high 
as $6.6 million in three years.

The 5 Point Cafe, a Seattle dive bar, was the first to explicitly ban Glass, launching a campaign to warn customers months before the gadget was available.

Many saw it as a publicity stunt - but dozens of places have now followed.

Experts say the gadget could challenge privacy laws around the world.

'Google Glass will test the right to privacy versus the First Amendment,' said Bradley Shear, a social media expert at George Washington University.

Nick Pickles, director of British privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'The implications of them being controlled by an unknown third party would make phone hacking look like a minor blip. 

Thad Starner, a pioneer of wearable computing who is a technical adviser to the Glass team, said he and colleagues had experimented with Glass-type devices for years, 'and I can’t think of a single instance where something bad has happened.'

However, University of Toronto computer 
engineering professor and wearable computer pioneer Steve Mann was at a McDonald’s restaurant in Paris
last when he claims an employee tried to physically remove a similar gadget 
he designed from his head.

Assault: The three men, one wearing a McDonad's shirt, another with a McDonald's name tag, not visible, demanded to know why Dr Mann had the glasses

Google has tried to play down the controversy.

'We’re acutely aware of those questions,' Schmidt responded to similar concerns raised at Harvard over the device's abilities being so new.

'We want to be very careful that this new invention is not misused ... But I’m always concerned about premature regulation based on fear, as opposed to understanding what’s possible.

'The people who’ve used Glass, including myself, report it as remarkable. I’d like to let it get a little bit farther off a runway before we characterize it in the obvious ways,' Schmidt said.

Google Glass offers a uniquely detailed view of your life and your surroundings and while Google’s main interest is selling advertising, there are a whole range of reasons why other people might seek to do all they can to get access to a device.

'The only way to protect yourself and the people around you is to not wear them.'

Google says that Glass is a work in progress, with test versions now being released to 2,000 developers.

Another 8,000 'explorers,' people handpicked by Google, will soon get a pair after winning an online contest.

Google admits the technology is still facing issues.

- Google chairman Eric Schmidt

'We are thinking very carefully about how we design Glass because new technology always raises new issues,' said Courtney Hohne, a Google spokeswoman.

However, the firm has also encouraged developers to experiment with the device - and at its developer conference in San Francisco next week is holding sessions dedicated to 'Hacking Google Glass'.

'Our goal is to make the world better,' Google chairman Eric Schmidt said of the device at Harvard University last week.

'We’ll
take the criticism along the way, but criticisms are inevitably from 
people who are afraid of change or who have not figured out that there 
will be an adaptation of society to it,' he said.

'We want to be very careful that this new invention is not misused ... But I’m always concerned about premature regulation based on fear, as opposed to understanding what’s possible.

'The people who’ve used Glass, including myself, report it as remarkable. I’d like to let it get a little bit farther off a runway before we characterize it in the obvious ways,' Schmidt said.

Business owners have been unimpressed.

Peter Feinstein, managing partner of Sapphire Gentlemen's Club in Las Vegas, said that patrons will be asked to check the eyewear when they come in.

He said: ‘We've been dealing with the cellphone videoing and the picture taking over the years and we are quick to make sure that that doesn't happen in the club.

‘As the sale of (Google Glass) spreads, there'll be more people using them and wanting to use them at places such as a gentlemen's club.

‘If we see those in the club, we would do the same thing that we do to people who bring cameras into the club.

The glasses will also be able to take part in live video chats

‘If they don't want to check it, we'd be happy to give them a limo ride back to their hotel’.

A spokesman for MGM resorts, which owns the MGM Grand Casino in Las Vegas, said that picture-taking was ‘frowned upon’ inside its properties.

He said: ‘Security officers on duty ask individuals not to take pictures for the privacy of others in the casino.

‘This new product is nothing new in terms of a challenge for us, because for so many years, the very tiniest of portable lipstick and pinpoint cameras have been around.’

Regal Entertainment Group, one of the 
largest cinema chains in the US, added that no recording devices were 
permitted into its cinemas.

With
a quiet wink of an eye Google Glass users will now be able to take a 
picture thanks to one of many new apps released and currently in 
development for the device.

Snap! A new app for Google Glass called Winky allows users to take pictures with the blink of an eye

Ordinarily Glass users must deliver an audible command of, 'OK, Glass, Take a picture,' to kick in the camera's software.

However with its release this week program Winky will additionally give users the option of silently ordering the command.

'You
might not think it's hard to say "Ok, Glass Take a Picture" or even 
just tap a button. But it's a context switch that takes you out of the 
moment, even if just for a second,' Winky's developer Mike DiGiovanni 
from Roundarch Isobar explained on his Google+ page on Wednesday.

'I've
taken more pictures today than I have the past 5 days thanks to this,' 
he continued. 'Sure, they are mostly silly, but my timeline has now 
truly become a timeline of where I've been.'

However
while pirating images of subjects in public may be one use for the 
device, speaking like one will not be allowed, as Geek.com has revealed.

Google's
voice translation technology censors curse words, prohibiting its user 
from for instance sending a voice-written email containing an 
explicative.

Currently
there is said to be no way to disable to filter, which would work 
similar to Google's SafeSearch option, the website reports.
