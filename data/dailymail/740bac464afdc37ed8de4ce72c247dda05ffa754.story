Germany has ratcheted up its row with America over CIA spying in the country with the immediate expulsion of the agency’s Berlin chief.

The dramatic rebuke to Washington comes after Germany’s intelligence agency, the BND, uncovered two cases of alleged American spying in a week.

The U.S. official was told to leave the country in a public signal of Angela Merkel’s fury over US spying on Germany which in the past has included repeated snooping on her own mobile phone.

A NATO ally expelling the spy chief of a friendly country is an extraordinary move but Mrs. Merkel has public opinion behind her. New polls show that many Germans want increased independence from America because of its snooping programme.

'The representative of the US intelligence services at the United States embassy has been asked to leave Germany,' a German government spokesman said.

'The request occurred against the backdrop of the ongoing investigation by federal prosecutors as well as the questions that were posed months ago about the activities of US intelligence agencies in Germany.'

The move came a day after Berlin police searched the home and office of a German military intelligence official alleged to have been spying for America.

The suspect is a foreign country specialist in the German defence ministry’s political department and has not yet been charged.

German military intelligence alerted prosecutors after the suspect was found to have 'met suspiciously often with US contacts', according to Spiegel Magazine.

A week ago a German intelligence agent was arrested after handing over German secrets to the US in exchange for cash.The 31-year-old employee of the BND stands accused of selling 218 top secret German intelligence documents he downloaded on to a USB stick for 25,000 pounds.

Last year documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former NSA employee, revealed that the agency had been monitoring Mrs Merkel’s mobile phone.
