Tucking into fresh, local produce should be part of the holiday experience. But it seems Britons prefer to stick to what they know. 

According to a new study, one in ten holidaymakers resorts to cooking British dishes when abroad because their family won't eat foreign food.

A quarter of them (24 per cent) cook a traditional roast, while 21 per cent rustle up fish and chips.

Fish dinner: 21 per cent rustle up fish and chips when away from home soil

The research found that 33 per cent of holidaymakers prefer eating traditional British food rather than sampling local delicacies.

However it's not only a suntan that we tend to bring back from our hols.

Although 10 per cent refuse to touch local food, many come home inspired by recipes they've tried while away.

Paella tops the list of meals recreated back home as 10 percent consider Spain one of the top ten countries for food inspiration.

Tapas also ranked highly with 40 per cent recreating the small, savoury dishes at home. 

Italy is the country most likely to encourage culinary masterpieces back on home soil, with 23 per cent of returning holiday makers attempting new  Italian dishes.

India comes a far second, with only 12 per cent trying to cook authentic Indian dishes.

Drink up: Brazilian cachaça is a favourite drink to make

France
 and China were also considered inspiration foodie havens, as were 
Mexico, America and Japan with four percent of the votes, and Barbados 
and Portugal (two per cent each) 

Meanwhile, two thirds try to recreate the holiday mood by mixing up as many as three different drinks inspired by their trip.

The
 survey was conducted by Morrisons. Their spokesperson said,  'Feeding 
the family when on holiday can often be difficult which is why many 
people find it easier to cook meals they're familiar with.'

Mother
 of two Susan Baker, 42, of Southampton, Hants, said: 'My husband still 
likes his fish and chips and English breakfast when we go to Spain.

'We eat in a lot of places which do typical English food and the kids are happiest with things they recognise too.

'But do like to have a paella too and I've given it a go at home - it never tastes as good though.'
