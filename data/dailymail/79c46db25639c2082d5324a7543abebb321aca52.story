A teacher has created an incredible friendship with a student 14 years after the teen's assault claim ended his career.

Josh Kaplowitz was teaching troubled students at Emery Elementary School in Washington D.C. in September 2001 when seven-year-old Raynard Ware said he manhandled him. 

The incident led to the Yale graduate's arrest and 33 hours in a detention cell. Just two days later he was also fired and his career was finished. 

But the pair have now rekindled after Ware reached out, saying he apologized for 'everything that happened' after 're-evaluating the past'. 

Rekindled: Former teacher Josh Kaplowitz (left) and Raynard Ware have created a friendship 14 years after the student's assault claim at Emery Elementary School in Washington D.C. left his career in tatters 

Ware's mother filed a $20million lawsuit against him - which led to his acquittal during the criminal case - but the state's education department settled for $90,000.

Since then Kaplowitz has been back to college and is now working as a lawyer at a top D.C, firm, while Ware, who was considered a troubled child at school, is currently a a business major at Morehouse College in Atlanta and hoping to pursue a career in finance with JP Morgan.

The pair had not any contact until 2012 - when Ware decided to send Kaplowitz a Facebook friend request. He told his mother it was 'all about forgiveness'. 

It took Kaplowitz days - including consultations with his wife and past employees - to decide whether to respond.

He told the Washington Post his thoughts were: 'You ruined my life' and had only got over the incident a couple of years beforehand. 

Future: Kaplowitz gives Raynard Ware a tour of Crowell & Moring, the law firm he works at in Washington, DC. The Yale graduate has rebuilt his career after he was arrested in 2001 following claims he pushed Ware

Kaplowitz had turned down a job working for Al Gore's presidential campaign to into teaching, believing he would have an impact on children's lives.

But he soon realized he was not cut out for it. He told The Post: 'I never hurt a kid. But I was not a good teacher, and I yelled a lot. I was in the survival mind-set of getting through the day. If there's one thing I try to block out, it's what a lousy teacher I was most of the time.'

The father accepted the request and then received a message from Ware saying: 'Hey, Mr. Kaplowitz I'm Raynard as you can see. I just wanted to say I'm doing well. I graduated high school with a 3.6. I also had scholarship offers from Georgetown, Yale and Morehouse. I choose to attend Morehouse because I felt I wasn't prepared for Yale or Georgetown. ... I've re-evaluated the past incident and I just want to say I apologize for everything that happened. I would really appreciate it if I could hear back from you. ttyl!!'

A few weeks later, Kaplowitz replied saying: 'Raynard — it's a pleasant surprise to hear from you, and great to find out how well you are doing. ... I have gained some perspective of my own over the last 10+ years, and I now have a son who is the same age as you were when you were in my class.

Hey, Mr. Kaplowitz I'm Raynard as you can see. I just wanted to say I'm doing well. I graduated high school with a 3.6. I also had scholarship offers from Georgetown, Yale and Morehouse.

I would really appreciate it if I could hear back from you. ttyl!! 

From Joshua Kaplowitz on January 31, 2012

Raynard — it's a pleasant surprise to hear from you, and great to find out how well you are doing. ... I have gained some perspective of my own over the last 10+ years, and I now have a son who is the same age as you were when you were in my class. While I deeply appreciate your apology, you should know that I don't blame you and never took anything that happened personally. The whole thing obviously had a big impact on my life, but I'm doing well now with a family and a new career as a lawyer. ... I'd be happy to meet you to catch up further. ...

Ware was considered a troubled student while at school. But he decided to move away from his dysfunctional life and is now a business major at Morehouse College in Atlanta. He reached out to Kaplowitz in 2012

Looking forward: The pair, pictured next to the playground of the old elementary school, are looking at writing a book about their experiences 

'While I deeply appreciate your apology, you should know that I don't blame you and never took anything that happened personally. The whole thing obviously had a big impact on my life, but I'm doing well now with a family and a new career as a lawyer. ... I'd be happy to meet you to catch up further. ...'

The pair then met for lunch at a City Grill. They avoided talking about what happened - instead talking about Ware's progress.

But at the end of the meeting, the former teacher asked whether he wanted to write a book on the incident and their relationship. He believes it would provide a second chance for him - even though he his concerned some may take his story the wrong way. 

The Post reported that Ware liked the notion of letting the world know that he was moving on up, escaping a dysfunctional life. 

Ware told the paper: 'He gets validation from me, knowing he wasn't as bad a teacher as he thought he was, that he made an impact in my life, that now we're both doing well.

'And I learn a lot from Josh. I pick up little things, certain lingo, being in corporate America like Josh is. I watch people really closely. I grew up very quiet, and people think I'm not listening, but I take it all in.'
