Jeremy Hunt was given a clean bill of health by David Cameron last night just 25 minutes after disclosing damning new details of his closeness to James Murdoch.

The Prime Minister backed his Culture Secretary despite the revelation that Mr Hunt exchanged friendly texts with Mr Murdoch before and after assuming responsibility for the BSkyB takeover bid.

In addition, it emerged Mr Hunt was in phone contact with the media boss on the very day he was handed oversight of the controversial deal.

Questions: Jeremy Hunt, who is fighting to save his ministerial career, 
has a gruelling day of questioning at the Leveson Inquiry today

He also appears to have ignored legal advice from Government lawyers who told him he should have no 'external discussions' about the deal while it was being handled by Business Secretary Vince Cable.

Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne are also facing tough questions over exactly why the Culture Secretary was handed responsibility for the BSkyB deal even though they were aware of his enthusiastic support for it.

Despite the startling revelations at the Leveson Inquiry into the Press, the Prime Minister formally dismissed demands for Mr Hunt to face an investigation into whether he breached ministerial rules just 25 minutes after he had left the witness box.

That swift decision drew a sharp 
response from Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the committee on 
standards in public life, who said it was an 'error of judgment'.

'I
just get the feeling it's beginning to feel like the latter end of the 
Blair government in not having the high standards that the public want 
to see from the political class,' he said.

Downing
Street insisted no evidence that Mr Hunt had mishandled the bid had 
emerged during his six hours before the inquiry, and allegations against
him would not be referred to Sir Alex Allan, the Prime Minister's 
independent adviser on the Ministerial Code.

That
was despite evidence that James Murdoch, the News Corp boss, had texted
Mr Hunt 'Well played' on the day he decided not to refer the BSkyB bid 
to the Competition Commission.

Labour said it was clear he had breached the code, misled Parliament and should resign.

Mr Hunt also admitted yesterday that he had considered resigning amid the controversy over his department's handling of the bid.

But
he finally agreed that his special adviser Adam Smith, who exchanged 
hundreds of texts and emails with News Corp, should go instead.

He
told the inquiry: 'I did think about my own position, but I had 
conducted the bid scrupulously, and I believed it was possible to 
demonstrate that, and I decided it wouldn't be appropriate for me to 
go.'

The inquiry was told 
the Mr Hunt sent a text to Mr Murdoch just hours before he was given 
responsibility for determining the BSkyB bid congratulating him on 
gaining EU clearance for the deal.

'Just
Ofcom to go,' he told Mr Murdoch, referring to the broadcasting 
watchdog.

Mr Hunt also texted Mr Osborne saying he was 'seriously 
worried we are going to screw this up' minutes after Mr Cable was 
revealed to have been caught boasting he had 'declared war' on the 
Murdoch empire.

He also 
emailed Andy Coulson, then director of communications at No 10, to say: 
'Could we chat about this... am seriously worried Vince will do real 
damage to Coalition with his comments.'

Though Mr Hunt had been 
expressing support in both public and private for the deal, the PM then 
decided to hand him responsibility for the bid as Mr Cable was forced to
step aside.

Government 
insiders are now braced for Mr Osborne to be called to give evidence to 
the inquiry to explain his role in Mr Hunt's appointment after it 
emerged he texted the Culture Secretary to declare: 'I hope you like the
solution!'

Labour said Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne had replaced a 
minister clearly biased against Mr Murdoch with one who was clearly in 
favour.

Despite his 
officials advising him not to get involved with any 'external 
discussions' on the deal for fear of compromising the Government's 
impartiality, Mr Hunt had spoken out publicly in favour and given a 
'sympathetic hearing' to Mr Murdoch without his officials present in a 
phone call in November 2010.

The
Culture Secretary insisted yesterday that he acted impartially once he 
was given responsibility for the bid the following month and took advice
from regulators.

Mr Hunt 
admitted he had not told officials deciding whether he could act 
impartially that he had sent Mr Cameron a memo supporting the bid.

In
March last year, when Mr Hunt decided not to refer the takeover to the 
Competition Commission, Mr Murdoch texted him: 'Big few days. Well 
played.' The Culture Secretary replied: 'Thanks think we got right 
solution!' The News Corp bid to take full control of BSkyB was 
eventually abandoned as the phone hacking scandal erupted.

Mr
Hunt was emotional when he spoke about the resignation of Mr Smith, who
admitted 'inappropriate' contacts with News Corp lobbyist Frédéric 
Michel. The Culture Secretary admitted he had not given 'express 
instructions' to Mr Smith about talking to the company.

'I
wish we had spelled out to him that he needed to be very careful,' he 
said. 'I wish he had told us about the pressure he was under and the 
barrage he was getting.

'Adam
Smith is one of the most decent, straight and honourable persons that 
you could imagine and even he was not able to maintain the impartiality 
that he needed to.'

He 
admitted finally telling Mr Smith: 'Everyone here thinks you should go.'
But he added: 'I wasn't including myself in “everyone”.'

Harriet
Harman, Labour's deputy leader, said: 'Jeremy Hunt should never have 
been given the quasi-judicial role in the first place as he was biased 
in favour of the bid.

'He 
should not be in his job now as he has broken the Ministerial Code and 
misled Parliament. At the very least, David Cameron should refer him to 
the independent adviser on ministerial interests. Mr Cameron said he 
would stand up for high standards but he is sweeping this matter under 
the carpet.'

A Downing 
Street spokesman said: 'Mr Hunt's evidence has shown that he acted 
properly while he was responsible for the BSkyB bid. He took independent
advice at every turn, as well as a number of decisions which were 
against News Corporation's wishes.

'As
the Permanent Secretary of the department made clear, Jeremy Hunt set 
up a process which left him with a “vanishingly small” chance to 
“manipulate” the bid.

'There
are some lessons to be learned from this process and that's why the 
Cabinet Secretary has written to all departments regarding the way 
quasi-judicial decisions are taken.

The Prime Minister will not be referring Jeremy Hunt to Sir Alex Allan.'
