In space, the lack of gravity can stretch an astronaut’s spine causing them to grow in height by as much as 3 inches (7cm).

In an effort to prevent this, scientists have developed skin-tight spacesuits that mimic the force of gravity on the human body.

Using designs by MIT, scientists at King's College London are refining the tight-fitting ‘skinsuits’ for testing in space to help astronauts overcome back problems.

The Skinsuit is a tailor-made overall with a bi-directional weave specially designed to counteract the lack of gravity by squeezing the body from the shoulders to the feet with a similar force to that felt on Earth

The Skinsuit is woven in two directions to counteract the lack of gravity by squeezing the body from the shoulders to the feet.

Current prototypes are made of spandex although new materials are being examined.

‘Getting the suit to fit correctly was challenging,’ said Simon Evetts, Medical Projects and Technology Unit team lead at the European Astronaut Centre.

Floating in space, astronauts’ bodies adapt to weightlessness in ways that are not always wanted. Bone and muscle waste away as they have less work to do without gravity (left). On the right, the force the suit is producing is being  measured at the feet with a computer using force transducers in the soles of the footwear

Imagine that the vertebrae in the human back comes in the form a giant spring. Pushing down on the spring keeps it coiled tightly. When the force is released, the spring stretches out.

In the same way, the spine elongates by up to three per cent while humans travel in space. There is less gravity pushing down on the vertebrae, so they can stretch out - up to 3inches (7cm).

The process gradually reverses once astronaut's return to Earth. However, the process can cause  backache and a fourfold increased chance of slipping a disc.

‘We needed to create a suit that is both tight-fitting but comfortable to wear, while creating the right amount of force in the right places.’

Floating in space, astronauts’ bodies adapt to weightlessness in ways that are not always wanted. Bone and muscle waste away as they have less work to do without gravity.

As a result, astronauts suffer from backache during their missions. Back on Earth an astronaut has four times more chance of suffering a slipped disc than usual.

The issues are likely to pose an even greater challenge on longer missions such as journeys to Mars.

Esa astronaut Andreas Mogensen will be the first to wear the suit in space during his mission in 2015.

The Skinsuit has potential for use on Earth as well as for astronauts. ‘If the technology is effective in space, it could help the elderly and many people with lower-back problems on Earth, said Mr Evetts.

‘Additionally, Skinsuit technology could improve the support garments currently used for conditions like cerebral palsy.’
