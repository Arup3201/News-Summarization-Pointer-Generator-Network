Two brand new iPhones and the Apple Watch have finally been unveiled but Australian customers can expect to fork out 25 percent more than the US for one of the new handsets when they hit the market next week.

The larger iPhone handsets, which were unveiled in the US on Wednesday morning, will first hit the market on September 19 and you can pre-order one from Friday.

Prices for the iPhone 6 start from $869, compared with $649 in the US. The iPhone 6 Plus will retail from $999 in Australia and $749 abroad.

The brand new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus range were unveiled in the US on Wednesday morning by Apple chief executive Tim Cook

Apple will sell the iPhone 6 in gold, silver and grey and prices will start at $869 for the 16GB model and $999 for the 64GB. For the first time, Apple will sell a 128GB model for $1,129.

The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen and curved edges, with 38 percent more pixels on the screen than the iPhone 5s.

But that's not the biggest model Apple is planning on selling in the new range.

The iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen and 185 percent more pixels than the 5S.

Like the iPhone 6, the Plus model is also sold in gold, silver and grey but it's naturally more expensive.

It will start from $999 for the 16GB model, $1,129 for the 64GB model and $1,249 for a 128GB handset.

The latest iPhone, the 5s, currently retails for $749 for the 16GB model.

But the anticipated Apple Watch, which is the company's first foray into the world of wearable items, won't be around until early 2015.

While an Australian price for the watch hasn't yet been announced, it will retail in the US from $349.

The watch, which received a standing ovation when it was unveiled, has a rectangular bezel, rectangular sapphire crystal screen, curved edges and is made of metal.

It will come in three finishes - Apple Watch, which comes in silver, the Apple Watch Sport and the Apple Watch Edition, which will be available in 18-karat gold.

Apple haven't specified what the battery life was like on the Apple Watch, but did say it would need to be charged each night.

The watch works 'seamlessly' with the iPhone 5C, 5S as well as the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and it lets users dictate messages via a microphone on the device.

Australian retailers are said to be gearing up to battle it out over the new iPhone range.

Optus fired the first canon on Sunday when it revealed people who abandon their existing contracts with rival companies would be given credit to offset cancellation charges if they move to a 24-month Optus plan.

The move is timed to take advantage of the pre-Christmas influx of new smartphone models, such as the newly unveiled iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

Telsyte senior analyst Foad Fadaghi said Optus' rivals would likely launch aggressive counter strategies in the coming months.

'This is a win for consumers if we see increased competition around the launch of the new (Apple) handset (and) some of the barriers come down for switching,' Mr Fadaghi said.
