Logan Steed was kicked out after being suspended four times in his first year

The cherubic face and angelic smile might suggest a sweet disposition.

But Logan Steed’s school record indicates otherwise – he was suspended four times in his first year before finally being expelled.

The five-year-old has bitten and punched other children and staff, thrown school equipment and  stolen fruit.

On one occasion his entire class was evacuated to protect other pupils.

The last straw came when he kicked a teacher in the face as she bent over his chair.

But his parents claim he is well-behaved at home and say he has been ‘thrown on the scrapheap’ by the school.

‘They said they had to exclude him to ensure the safety of the staff and pupils but I don’t understand how a five-year-old can pose so much of  a threat,’ said his father, Cameron, 27, a care home manager.

Logan’s uncontrollable behaviour was noted on his first day as a four-year-old at Powers Hall Infant School in Witham, Essex, in September last year.

He was soon put on a report system under which he was monitored daily and information emailed by his head teacher to his parents, who are separated.

He had been ‘kicking, biting, pinching and punching adults’, said a report on November 20 last year.

Damaging effects: Logan's family believe Powers Hall Infant School has 'thrown him on the scrap heap' and that the expulsion will affect him for the rest of his life

'Threat': Headteacher Claire Edwards said in her
report that she was forced to exclude the boy because of the risk to 
the safety of other children and staff

It also detailed the incident a week earlier that led to his expulsion.

‘He was sitting and the member of 
staff was holding his arms. He kicked his legs straight into the member 
of staff’s face,’ the report said.

‘She let go of his arms and he ran off into the library.’

Angel-faced: Logan Steed's parents Laura, 22, and Cameron, 27, say he is always well behaved at home

Kicked out: Logan, pictured aged three, was suspended four times in his first year after being accused of violence and causing chaos by throwing food around

It was not clear yesterday why the 
teacher had been holding Logan, who has been tested for several 
conditions including Asperger’s syndrome and abnormalities to do with 
his diet and health.

All came back negative.

The school tried to manage his 
behaviour with action plans including one-to-one support from the head 
teacher and allowing him to do his activities in any order.

Isolated: Logan, who splits his week between his parents' homes, now receives just an hour of tuition a week

His mother, Laura, 22, a chef from Braintree, Essex, said: ‘Before Logan started school we didn’t know he had this side to him.

'It is like we are talking about two 
completely different boys. At home he does exactly what he is told and 
we have never seen him do any of the things the school say he did.

'He really is a clever boy and now that is being wasted.’

'Dangerous': Logan, pictured with mother Laura, was taken out of the care of one teacher with whom he got on after she became pregnant

Mr and Mrs Steed believe their son should be at a mainstream school where he can socialise with other children.

They have a right to appeal against his expulsion but decided not to because of the possible reaction if he was reinstated.

At present, Logan receives an hour of tuition a day at a specialist school.

Head teacher Claire Edwards said her staff and pupils ‘deserve to work and learn in a safe place’.

She added: ‘The decision to permanently exclude a child is never taken lightly and one I take with great sadness.

‘This school takes a firm stance on the safety of pupils and staff and assaults on either cannot and will not be tolerated.’
