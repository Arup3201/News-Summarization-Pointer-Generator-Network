David Moyes was given a six-year deal when he was picked as Sir Alex Ferguson's successor at Manchester United last year - and it seems 'The Chosen One' is still sticking around at Old Trafford.

United have been busy putting up a huge new poster outside their famous home, showing off their new kit design, new players and their new manager.

Louis van Gaal appears front and centre despite not officially having started his job yet - and eagled-eyed fans have noticed some startling similarities with their unsuccessful former boss.

The image is plastered over the back of Old Trafford's East Stand and Van Gaal - currently in Brazil with Holland - doesn't look quite right. In fact, it seems his head has simply been airbrushed on Moyes' body!

Luke Shaw also features on the banner which is being put up as United prepare for the new season.

Supporters will be hoping that while Van Gaal might bear some similarities to Moyes in this image, he can provide some altogether different results in the Premier League this coming season.
