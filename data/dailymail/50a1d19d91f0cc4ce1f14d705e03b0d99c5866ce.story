Hull KR have completed the re-construction of their new threequarter line with the signing of England Knights winger Kieran Dixon on a three-year contract from London Broncos.

Dixon has been recognised as one of the most promising talents in Super League since bursting onto the scene two years ago but a move to big-spending Salford fell through at the end of last season when he sustained a major knee injury playing for the Knights against Samoa.

Dixon, who made his Super League comeback in the Broncos' shock 40-36 win over Leeds on Sunday, when he took his try tally to 38 in 52 appearances, is the Robins' fifth new recruit for 2015 and will join Ken Sio, Josh Mantellato and Darrell Goulding in a new-look back line.

'I wanted a new challenge and when I had the opportunity to come here I was very honoured,' said Dixon, who turns 22 on Friday.

'I'll be moving my family from one side of the country to the other so it is going to be a big change for us but one we are excited about.

'There's a big history at the club and the derby was something that appealed to me too. I've been in London my whole life and there isn't anything like the rivalry in Hull down there.

'I spoke to some boys that have played here and they say the city splits in two on derby day. I can't wait to be a part of it and show everyone what I can do for the red and white half of the city.

'I made the England Knights squad at the end of last year but my injury halted my progress a little bit.

'It's been frustrating but after two good years I'm hoping I can get back to my best form and challenge for an England spot in the not too distant future.'

Hull KR coach Chris Chester said: 'We're delighted that Kieran has chosen to come to Hull KR from next season.

'He was on the verge of a full England call-up 12 months ago and he's had plenty of interest from other clubs so it's great that we've been able to sign a player of his calibre.

'We've identified a lack of speed in the outside backs and Kieran certainly brings pace in abundance. He's a great finisher and he scored another good try at the weekend so we're looking forward to what he can bring to the side.'

Honoured: Dixon admits he was looking for a new challenge after two years playing for London Broncos

Dixon is the fourth confirmed London player to retain his Super League status following the Broncos' relegation to the Championship. Atelea Vea is joining St Helens and Denny Solomona and Matt Cook have secured moves to Castleford.

Broncos coach Joey Grima said: 'I want to make it quite clear to all our supporters that we did make a substantial offer to him over a seven to eight-week period of negotiations but in Kieran's mind he always wanted to play Super League.

'Both myself and the club wish Kieran all the very best. Chris Chester has done an amazing job with his recruitment strategy and Kieran will be a fine addition to that strategy moving forward.'
