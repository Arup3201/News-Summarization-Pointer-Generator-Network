Egypt's army chief said political strife was pushing the state to the brink of collapse

It's a stark warning from the institution that ran the country until last year as Cairo's first freely elected leader struggles to contain bloody street violence.

General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, appointed by President Mohamed Mursi last year to head the military, added in a statement on Tuesday that one of the primary goals of deploying troops in cities on the Suez Canal was to protect the waterway that is vital for Egypt's economy and world trade.

Sisi's comments, published on an official army Facebook page, followed 52 deaths in the past week as a result of disorder.

It highlighted the mounting sense of crisis facing Egypt and its Islamist head of state who is struggling to fix a teetering economy and needs to prepare Egypt for a parliamentary election in a few months that is meant to cement the new democracy.

After almost seven months since Mursi took office, Egypt politics have become even more deeply polarised.

Opponents spurned a call by Mursi for talks on Monday to try to end the violence. Instead, protesters have rallied in Cairo and Alexandria, and in the three Suez Canal cities - Port Said, Ismailia and Suez - where Mursi imposed emergency rule.

Today, thousands were again on the streets of Port Said to mourn the deaths of two people in the latest clashes there, taking the total toll in Mediterranean port alone to 42 people. Most were killed by gunshots in a city where weapons are rife.

Mohamed Ezz, a Port Said resident speaking by telephone, heard heavy gunfire through the night. 'Gunshots damaged the balcony of my flat, so I went to stay with my brother,' he said.

Residents in the three canal cities had taken to the streets in protest at a nightly curfew now in place there.

In Cairo on Tuesday afternoon, police again fired teargas as stone-throwing youths in a street near Tahrir Square, the centre of the 2011 uprising.

But the clashes were less intense than previous days and traffic was able to cross the area. Street cleaners swept up the remains of burnt tyres and other debris.

Street flare-ups are a common occurrence in divided Egypt, frustrating many people desperate for order and economic growth.

Although the general's comments were 
notably blunt, Egypt's military has voiced similar concerns in the past,
pledging to protect the nation. But it has refused to be drawn back 
into a direct political role after its reputation as a neutral party 
took a pounding during the 17 months after Mubarak fell.

'Egyptians
are really alarmed by what is going on,' said Cairo-based analyst 
Elijah Zarwan, adding that the army was reflecting that broader concern 
among the wider public. 

'But
I don't think it should be taken as a sign that the military is on the 
verge of stepping in and taking back the reins of government,' he added.

It seemed unlikely that Sisi was signalling the army wants to take 
back the power it held for six decades since the end of the colonial era
and through an interim period after the overthrow of former air force 
chief Hosni Mubarak two years ago.

But his message sent a powerful
message that Egypt's biggest institution, with a huge economic as well 
as security role and a recipient of massive direct U.S. subsidies, is 
worried about the fate of the nation, after five days of turmoil in 
major cities.

'The continuation of the struggle of the different 
political forces ... over the management of state affairs could lead to 
the collapse of the state,' said General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is 
also defence minister in the government Mursi appointed.

He said 
the economic, political and social challenges facing the country 
represented 'a real threat to the security of Egypt and the cohesiveness
of the Egyptian state' and the army would remain 'the solid and 
cohesive block' on which the state rests.

Sisi was picked by Mursi after the army handed over power to the new president in June once Mursi had sacked Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, in charge of Egypt during the transition and who had also been Mubarak's defence minister for 20 years.

Since the 2011 revolt, Islamists who Mubarak spent his 30-year rule 
suppressing have won two referendums, two parliamentary elections and a 
presidential vote. 

But that legitimacy has been challenged by an opposition that accuses 
Mursi of imposing a new form of authoritarianism. Mursi's supporters 
says protesters want to overthrow Egypt's first ever democratically 
elected leader by undemocratic means.

The instability has provoked unease in Western capitals, where officials
worry about the direction of a powerful regional player that has a 
peace deal with Israel. The United States condemned the bloodshed and 
called on Egyptian leaders to make clear violence was not acceptable.
