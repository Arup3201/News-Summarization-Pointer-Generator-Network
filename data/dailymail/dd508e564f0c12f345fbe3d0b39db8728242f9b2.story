The police in a small suburban South Florida city have made more than $5.8million selling cocaine to drugs dealers in the last two years - and it's all perfectly legal.

The undercover narcotics squad in Sunrise, Florida, runs a sprawling - and highly successful - 'reverse sting' operation in which officers pose as high-level drug suppliers to attract out-of-town buyers.

When the buyers show up and take possession of the drugs, the cops swoop in and put them in cuffs. Then they seize their cash, cars, jewelry and cell phones as the ill-gotten gains of drug trafficking. One deal netted more than $500,000 for the department.

The cops are able to do all of this thanks to a network of highly-paid, highly-motivated informants. Their star snitch has been revealed as a 'famme fatale' buxom brunette in her 40s who has brought in dozens of dealers. For her hard work, the Sunrise Police Department has paid her more than $800,000 in the last five years.

The South Florida Sun-Sentinel revealed Sunrise's shadowy drug activities after a six-month investigation into their operations. 

One key to the success of the reverse sting operation has been a seductive, shadowy female informant who has brought the police 63 cases that have resulted in more than $5million in property seizures since 2007. And she has been paid handsomely for her work - taking home $800,000 from the city of Sunrise.

Police have repeatedly refused to name the woman in court, though the Sun-Sentinel compiled a description of her based on police reports and depositions.

She's middle-aged, works as an on-again-off-again model, repeatedly refers to having a 'Colombian' connection. And she's fatally ruthless. 

In one case, she convinced a man that she was dating him to gain his trust so he would buy cocaine from the undercover officers. Their relationship lasted 19 days, the Sun Sentinel reports.

'We’re not talking about a few hours overtime. We’re talking about police officers who are now making hundreds of thousands of dollars. In my view, it’s all about the money.'

In another, she can be heard on her police microphone with drug mule attempting to buy 150 kilograms of cocaine from the undercover officers. She calls him 'my love' and gently encourages him when he is nervous.

Then, as he is being cuffed by officers, she laughs at him and walks away.

'I have to leave,' she can be heard giggling. 'Son of a b****.'

Unlike most police narcotics squads, which try to drive drug dealers out of the community, the undercover officers in Sunrise are actively recruiting drug dealers to travel to their middle-class city of 84,000.

Only seven of the 195 people Sunrise police arrested for cocaine trafficking in the last four years have been from the city of Sunrise. They come from New York, Philadelphia, Miami and as far away as Peru.

Their drug deals aren't made in shadowy alleys, but in classic suburban settings. The TGI Friday's at the Sawgrass Mills mall has been a favorite spot for officers to conduct their drug deals - and subsequent busts. 

The money and property that the detectives seize has been a tremendous source of income for the police department. 

In 2011 and 2012 alone, the department received more than $5.8million from drug seizures. Florida's laws allow the police to take any money and property used in drug trafficking operations.

The money has gone to buy all manner of police equipment - from guns to radios, to computers and bulletproof vests.

And it's also gone into the pockets of the officers involved in the narcotics squad, in the form of overtime pay. In 2010 alone, the small narcotics squad of a dozen officers got $1.2million in overtime.

Sgt. James Hughes, who leads the day-to-day operations of the unit, has reaped $240,000 in overtime pay in three and a half years.

Officers on the squad have taken home $315,00 to $620,00 each in salary and overtime since the reverse stings began.

'We’re not talking about a few hours overtime,' Miami defense attorney Alan Ross told the Sun-Sentinel.

'We’re talking about police officers who are now making hundreds of thousands of dollars.

'In my view, it’s all about the money.'
