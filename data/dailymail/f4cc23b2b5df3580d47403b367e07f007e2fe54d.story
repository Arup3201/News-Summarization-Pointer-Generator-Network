'Fighter': Nobby Stiles celebrates after the World Cup Final where England beat Germany 4-2 in 1966 having played in every game

Nobby Stiles, the ‘hard man’ of England’s 1966 World Cup-winning team, is battling prostate cancer, it was revealed yesterday.

The 71-year-old former Manchester United star was diagnosed following a routine visit to his GP but doctors are hopeful he will make a full recovery.

Stiles was with his family at home in Manchester yesterday and declined to comment. However, his son John, 49, confirmed the illness.

‘Thankfully it was diagnosed early and the outlook is extremely positive. We expect him to make a full recovery and are supporting him through it,’ he said.

Despite his health problems, Stiles, a grandfather and father-of-three, has continued to travel the country with his son giving after-dinner speeches about his career.

Stiles, who developed a fearsome reputation as a tough-tackling midfielder in his heyday, played every minute of the 1966 World Cup.

He was famously photographed holding the trophy in one hand and his false teeth in the other during the post-match celebrations at Wembley.

After retiring as a player he was manager of West Bromwich Albion and was the Manchester United youth team coach during the early 1990s. In 2000 he was made an MBE.

News of Stiles’s illness led to a flood of ‘get well’ messages from fans and friends in the game.

Former England and Manchester City star Mike Summerbee, who recently overcame prostate cancer, said: ‘Nobby was a brilliant footballer. He is a dear friend and a wonderful man.

‘I know from personal experience how you can come through this and I am sure Nobby will do the same. He is a larger than life character.’

John Hartson, a former Welsh 
international, who survived testicular and brain cancer four years ago, 
said: ‘I have no doubt Nobby Stiles can beat this.

'He was a fighter 
during his playing days who would put the fear of God into opponents.’

News of his illness comes 20 years after 1966 captain Bobby Moore died from bowel cancer at the age of 51.

Footballer turned Hollywood actor Vinnie Jones has revealed he and his wife are battling skin cancer.

The
48-year-old’s illness was diagnosed after he spotted a lump beneath his
eye. He has since had three operations to remove lumps and a tumour on 
the back of his head.

Jones
said he believes his condition could be a result of years of working 
outside and has urged footballers to ‘put on sunblock’.

Wife
Tanya, 47, has had a number of tumours removed in recent years. Doctors
believe her illness could be related to drugs she has taken as a heart 
transplant patient.
