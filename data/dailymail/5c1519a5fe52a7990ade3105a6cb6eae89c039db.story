Two suspects in the 
fatal shooting of a University of Michigan medical student say they 
sneaked into Paul DeWolf's basement bedroom at his medical fraternity 
during a burglary attempt and that his shooting was unintended, 
according to police statements.

The Detroit Free Press reported Sunday that it obtained police statements from two men 
jailed on murder and home invasion charges in the death of Paul DeWolf, a
25-year-old prospective surgeon whose body was found July 24.

According
to the statements, the suspects and a third man not yet charged in the 
case broke into Phi Rho Sigma medical fraternity and entered DeWolf's 
basement bedroom, startling him.

DeWolf went 
to get something from his dresser and one of the suspects tried to 
strike him with the gun, but it fired instead, according to the 
statements. Ann Arbor police Detective Katie Nucci recounted the 
statements at a Nov. 22 warrant hearing for Joei Jordan, 20, and 
Shaquille Jones, 21, the newspaper said.

Using data about a stolen computer, investigators tracked Jordan to Sumter County, S.C., and Jones to North Charleston, S.C.

A
third suspect accused of firing the gun is jailed in Michigan on a bond
violation in another case but hasn't been charged in DeWolf's killing.

DeWolf
was a native of Schoolcraft in southwestern Michigan and a graduate of 
Grand Valley State University. He was attending medical school on an Air
Force scholarship and held the rank of second lieutenant.

Jordan and Jones claim the gun accidentally went off as they were attempting to rob DeWolf

In
her testimony, Nucci said Jordan entered through an open rear window as
Jones and the third man remained outside. Jordan emerged a short time 
later with a PlayStation 3, taken from a basement recreation room in the
house and hidden in his backpack, the detective said.

Jordan
climbed back through the window and let the other two in through a rear
door, Jones told detectives. Eventually, they ended up in the basement,
where they hid in a utility closet when they heard two students coming 
down a hallway, Nucci testified.

The three of them then made their way to the room where DeWolf lived and entered.

Jones
said DeWolf got out of bed "and was asking what was going on," the 
detective testified. She said Jones told investigators that the third 
suspect "pulled out a handgun and pointed it" at the medical student and
"ordered DeWolf not to move."

Accomplice: Jordan and Jones say a third man who participated in the robbery actually fired the shot that killed DeWolf

"At some point 
DeWolf grabbed something off of his desk and/or drawer" and started to 
move toward the third suspect, at which time the man "raised the gun and
attempted to strike DeWolf with the gun, and the gun at that time 
fired."

DeWolf screamed, and the suspects ran off, Nucci testified.

The next court dates are Thursday for Jones and Dec. 12 for Jordan.
