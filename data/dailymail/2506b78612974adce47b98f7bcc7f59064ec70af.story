It's a chilling reflection of the grim realities of our modern society: one woman is killed almost every week by a current or former partner in Australia.

A powerful yet disturbing new campaign has featured children and Aussie celebrities to call on a change to sexist attitudes and to stop domestic violence once and for all.

The Our Watch campaign has released a video which begins with children listing their hopes and dreams for their future.

But it soon takes a dark turn when one girl says: 'When I grow up I am going to end up in hospital because my husband hit me.'

A powerful yet disturbing video of a new Our Watch campaign launched last week as part of an initiative to stop violence against women and children through community and school programs

'The long road to family violence starts with a belief that women are possessions not equals,' Model and DJ Ruby Rose said in the campaign video

The nationwide Our Watch campaign, which launched last week, is part of the foundation's strategy to prevent domestic violence in 20 years time.

To join the fight for an Australia free from domestic, family and sexual violence are also personalities such as Tara Moss, Ruby Rose, Magda Szubanski, Charlie Pickering and Shane Jacobson.

In the recently released video, they list a number of shocking truths behind violence against women and their children.

'One in six Australian women have experienced physical or sexual violence from a current or former partner,' comedian Charlie Pickering said.

'By saying no to attitudes, stereotypes and behaviours that support gender inequality and violence,' Shane Jacobson said

Actress Magda Szubanski says: 'No man wakes up one morning and out of the blue murders his partner.'

Former model Tara Moss adds that she is one of five women who have experienced sexual violence.

'I know one of these women. Me,' she said.

Australia's ambassador for women and girls and the foundation's board chair, Natasha Stott Despoja, says violence against women is a 'national emergency'.

'One woman is killed almost every week by a current or former partner in Australia,' she said in a statement.

'Our Watch has a mandate to stop this violence before it occurs. We are calling on all Australians to speak out and take action to prevent violence against women and their children on our watch.'

The campaign aims to educate challenge stereotypes and further educate boys to help create more positive and healthier ways of being men.

'The long road to family violence starts with a belief that women are possessions not equals,' Model and DJ Ruby Rose said in the campaign video.

'By saying no to attitudes, stereotypes and behaviours that support gender inequality and violence,' 'Shane Jacobson said.

Also in video is Rosie Batty, the mother who lost her son Luke in February when he was tragically killed by her estranged husband at cricket training.

'The murder of children usually occurs in the context of domestic violence,' she said.

Together, the advocates agree there's simply no excuse for domestic and sexual violence.

'This can't happen. Not on our watch,' Charlie Pickering said.
