The ex-girlfriend of Pedro Bravo, the Florida college student who murdered her new boyfriend in a fit of jealous rage, has spoken of her heartbreak over the brutal act, saying ‘he tricked us into thinking he wouldn’t hurt a fly’.

Erika Friman told ABC’s Matt Gutman in an interview for 20/20 that it was hard to believe that the smart, charismatic student she once dated was a murderer.

She said: ‘He kind of tricked us all, thinking, you know, this guy that’s shy and he wouldn’t hurt a fly.’

But the Miami student was convicted of first-degree murder last week, after prosecutors successfully argued that he'd strangled 18-year-old Christian Aguilar, who Friman said was 'the love of her life'.

She had not told Bravo about her new romance after they'd broken up.

Speaking about Bravo, Friman added: 'This was a person we knew. This was intentional, it makes it all so much worse. It’s like the knife just turns in your heart kind of thing.

'It sounds like the mind of a sociopath, or a sick person.'

The family of Aguilar watched in the courtroom as 20-year-old Bravo was found guilty.

'A lot of it was his obsession for me, and how he wanted me back and how he wanted to be with me,’ Friman said.

After a two-week trial, the jury in Gainesville also convicted Bravo of six other counts related to Aguilar's death.

Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty and Judge James Colaw sentenced Bravo to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

When Friman started dating Bravo she said he made her laugh, but by their senior year, he started to wear on her.

She told him she wanted to take a break from their relationship, but Bravo wouldn’t accept it and appeared depressed.

She said: 'I felt like he almost manipulated me at that point in my life, where he was kind of like, ‘if we do these things, we’ll never be the same.'

'I was really concerned that, I don’t know, something bad would happen if we took a break.’

When they broke up, Friman said Bravo was very emotional and cried, but she felt like a weight had just been lifted.

Aguilar's parents and family were silent as the verdicts were read. They left the courtroom hugging and began crying outside. Bravo watched the clerk read the verdict with no reaction. He appeared calm.

Aguilar's father, Carlos Aguilar, addressed the court before Bravo's sentencing.

'I cannot tell you the quantity of pain that we have been going through,' he said.

The victim's brother Alexander said, 'It’s been agonizing - so much pain and agony' according to The Miami Herald. 'I am now a student at the University of Florida. I would have loved to spend time with my brother here but that is never going to happen. I trusted the jury and they didn’t fail me.'

The victim's mother, Claudia Aguilar, said '[Bravo] made the most terrible decision for me and my family,' according to the newspaper.

Carlos Aguilar earlier said 'The
 reality is the verdict will not bring my son back. But Pedro was held 
accountable. I promised Christian at his burial that there would be 
justice' while speaking to The Herald.

Bravo had pleaded not guilty, saying he and Aguilar got into a fist fight the day the college student died but that he left Aguilar alive. Bravo remained defiant before his sentencing, rising and walking to the podium to speak.

'I know in my heart I did not do anything to hurt my friend that would cause him to die,' Bravo said to gasps in the courtroom.

'I know in my heart what I did, I know God knows what I did. I'll take life or life without parole, and I'll do it.'

Investigators found Aguilar's blood in Bravo's car and presented evidence that Bravo researched ways to drug people and dispose of bodies. Aguilar's body was found in the woods.

Aguilar and Bravo knew each other from their days at Doral Academy, a high school in Miami.

Bravo had dated Friman, who was also a student, while at Doral, but she and Aguilar had begun dating when the two moved to Gainesville for college.

Prosecutors presented reams of writings by Bravo that showed he was obsessed with Friman, so much so that he decided not to attend Florida International University so he could move to Gainesville and pursue her.

But when he arrived, Bravo learned Friman had begun seeing Aguilar.

Bravo bought what prosecutor's called a 'murderer's starting pack' including a shovel, duct tape and enough sleeping drugs to knock someone out.

For days, Aguilar ducked Bravo's attempts to meet with him. But after a mutual friend approached him on Bravo's behalf, Aguilar reluctantly agreed in an effort to help with Bravo's depression. On September 20, the two spent hours together eating and buying a CD at Best Buy.

Prosecutors say the two men were in Bravo's SUV in a Wal-Mart parking lot when Bravo slipped into the backseat, grabbed a strap, and choked Aguilar to death.

Taking the stand in his own defense, Bravo said he and Aguilar fought, and that he left his friend lying injured on the ground. But Aguilar was still alive, Bravo said.

The Gainesville Police Department released a statement, saying 'The men and women of the Gainesville Police Department stand relieved with the family of Christian Aguilar as a jury found Pedro Bravo guilty of 1st Degree Murder.

'For weeks, members of the Gainesville Police investigated the disappearance of Christian Aguilar and searched tirelessly for him.  It quickly became clear that a missing persons case had turned into a Murder case.  A very detailed investigation was completed that revealed Pedro Bravo was undoubtedly responsible for the murder of Christian Aguilar.'

'I am relieved,' Friman told The Miami Herald. 'I am exhausted. It’s been a long two years but I feel like the weight has finally been lifted off of us.'

Friman added to 20/20: 'People tell me all the time, ‘oh you’re so strong, you’re so brave,’ and I look at them, and I’m kind of just like, ‘well, if you were in my shoes, you would do the same thing, you would testify,’ she said.

'If it was the love of your life you lost, and this is the one thing you can do for him, for his family, for his memory, you would find a way to pull it all together.

Friman said there isn't a day that goes by that she doesn't think about Aguilar. She believes if he were alive today, they would have gotten married.

'I think we were soul mates,' she said.

'You don’t expect to lose your love that young, and not in such a traumatic way… [but] at the end of the day, when I think of all these unknowns, I think of how much Christian loved me, and that’s kind of what gets my through it.'
