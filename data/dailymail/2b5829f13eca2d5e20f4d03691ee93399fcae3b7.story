YouTube has officially launched a paid-for subscription service that will charge from 79p a month to watch videos on specialist channels, such as Comedy.TV and PGA Digital Golf.

Individual channels can charge more for a subscription if they choose to, and the majority of UK subscriptions charge £1.49 a month.

Over 50 channels are now 
subscription-only, but not all paid-for channels can be subscribed to in 
the UK - namely Jim Henson Family TV, and National Geographic Kids.

Comedy.TV is just one of the 53 YouTube channels that will now charge you to watch videos. Monthly subscriptions start at 79p, although individual channels can charge more. Each channel comes with a 14-day free trial and subscriptions can be cancelled at any time

YouTube has over 1 million channels.

More than 1 billion unique users visit YouTube each month.

Over 4 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube.

72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute.

70% of YouTube traffic comes from outside the US.

YouTube is localized in 53 countries and across 61 languages.

In 2011, YouTube had more than 1 trillion views or around 140 views for every person on Earth.

Millions of free subscriptions happen each day.

Free subscriptions allow you to connect with channels you're interested in and keep up with their activity on the site.

Rumours about the launch surfaced 
earlier this week.

The video site, owned by Google, then confirmed plans on its official blog on Friday.

Paying customers will be able to get access to exclusive videos, TV shows and films from select specialist channels.

Paying a subscription also removes adverts on certain channels.

Each subscription comes with a 14-day free trial. 

You can cancel a subscription at any time.

YouTube is also offering subscription deals to people who subscribe to more than one channel.

For example, if you subscribe to SmartTV.com for £6.49 a month, you get access to Cars.TV, Comedy.TV, ES.TV, JusticeCentral.TV, MyDestination.TV, Pets.TV and Recipe.TV.

YouTube revamped the site and introduced channels in December 2011.

In October 2012, the site launched 60 partner channels, including BBC Worldwide On Earth, ITN, the Jamie Oliver Food Channel and Mixmag TV.

Other partners include Channel 4 and Film 4, Howcast and The Onion and the site said it now has over 1 million channels.

YouTube has said that more of these partner channels are expected to be added to the subscription list in due course. 

The extra money made from subscriptions is expected to fund new TV and film shows that will be shown exclusively online.

Paid-for subscriptions are an alternative way for YouTube to make money, in addition to its advertising revenues.

The new channels have helped expand YouTube’s audience to 1bn users who watch 6bn hours of video each month.

You can already subscribe to get updates from other channels for free.

Over 50 channels have signed up to the subscription service. YouTube has over 1million partners including Howcast, BBC and Channel 4 and more are expected to be added the service in due course. Channels can use the money to show archived content or preview exclusive clips and shows

Stuart Fuller, Director of Commercial Operations and Communications at NetNames, commented on the launch: 'The growing popularity of on-demand video channels such as those offered by Netflix and LoveFilm has led to many users abandoning YouTube. 

'Google will intend to better control content that is uploaded on to YouTube through such pay models, and hence avoiding painful and costly task of taking down pirated content online.

'Consumers will need to start getting used to this type of online models.

'Subscription models are only set to become more and more common in future.'

Rumours about paid-for subscriptions 
began in January when AdAge reported YouTube had been in touch with a 
'small group of channel producers'.

At the time, a Google spokesman said: 'We're looking into creating a subscription platform that could bring even more great content to YouTube for our users to enjoy and provide our creators with another vehicle to generate revenue from their content, beyond the rental and ad-supported models we offer.'

Then in February, Android fan blog Android Police noticed the YouTube app had been updated to include 'channel subscribe' code.

YouTube is also believed to be considering charging for content libraries and access to live events on a pay-per-view basics

The code appeared to describe a function in the app which tells users they can only subscribe to or unsubscribe from paid channels from their desktop or laptop computers.

It reads: '<string name="paid_channel_subscribe_message">You can only subscribe to this paid channel on your computer.</string>'

And: '<string name="paid_channel_unsubscribe_message"> You can only unsubscribe from
this paid channel on your computer.</string>'

In
addition to episodic content, YouTube is also considering charging for 
content libraries and access to live events on a pay-per-view basics, as
well as self-help or financial advice shows.

YouTube has launched the paid-for subscription as an experiment.

The
revenue split between YouTube and the channel producers is expected to 
be similar to the 45-55 split that YouTube currently has with 
advertising revenue.

At a media conference last year, YouTube's CEO Salar Kamangar said that a subscription model would give TV networks and producers of these networks a more direct line to their audience with lower costs.

A Google spokesman added: 'We have long maintained that different content requires different types of payment models.

'There are a lot of our content creators that think they would benefit from subscriptions, so we're looking at that.'
