A self-portrait of Sir Anthony van Dyck could remain in Britain after the withdrawal of its buyer – the son-in-law of Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone.

Financier James Stunt, who is married to Mr Ecclestone’s daughter Petra, said he pulled out of the purchase in ‘light of the people’s passion’ to keep it in the UK.

The artwork, dating back to 1640, had been destined for his LA home but a fundraising campaign called for it to stay in Britain.

The work, which dates back to 1640, has now been offered to the National Portrait Gallery in London for £10 million after discussions between Mr Stunt, art dealer Philip Mould and its current owner Alfred Bader.

Mr Stunt said: 'When I agreed to buy this great portrait I didn't expect the huge swell of public opinion and the strength of emotion its export would generate.

'In light of the people's passion to purchase the Van Dyck for the nation I have carefully reconsidered my position and have decided, with Dr Bader and Mr Mould's agreement, to withdraw from the process.

'I trust that my withdrawal, together with the reduced price at which the painting is now being offered, will see the appeal succeed and that Van Dyck's final self portrait will permanently hang in the National Portrait Gallery.'

Campaigners have already raised £3.6million towards buying the painting, with donations coming in from thousands of people, and have four months left to meet the new price which is £2.5million less than originally stated.

Mr Mould said: 'Watching the public reaction to Van Dyck's self-portrait develop in this unprecedented way has been amazing, and, for this lover of British historical portraiture, reassuring.

'The picture has become an iconic focal point, and for many the thought of it going to the United States would be like losing a chunk of Stonehenge. I am delighted to be able to help the National Portrait Gallery's campaign in this way.'

The work was in a private collection for almost 400 years before it was sold - forcing the Government to issue a temporary export bar which allowed campaigners time to try and save it.

Van Dyck was born in modern-day Belgium and came to work in England in 1632 at the invitation of King Charles I.

The painting, which is on show at the central London gallery, will go around the country on a three-year tour if it is saved.
