A lorry driver has dodged death after his cab erupted into flames, completely destroying his vehicle. 

Truck driver Wayne Catt had been delivering goods to Morecambe, Lancashire, and was travelling back to Burnley with his beloved dog Tinkerbell when he noticed smoke coming from the dashboard. 

The 43-year-old grabbed his four-year-old Patterdale Terrier - who travels everywhere with him - from the cab before escaping from the lorry just seconds before it burst into flames and the blaze took over.

Truck driver Wayne Catt was travelling with his beloved dog Tinkerbell when he noticed smoke coming from the dashboard. The 43-year-old jumped into action and grabbed his four-year-old Patterdale Terrier - who travels everywhere with him - before escaping from the lorry

The lorry, which was completely gutted following the fire, caused the road around the scene for about an hour while fire crews extinguished the blaze

Teams of firefighters battled to tackle the blaze. Mr Catt said: 'I had just stopped off at Pye Motors For a brew and come back to the truck and set off again.'I only got a a little way down the road and I saw smoke coming out of the dashboard'

Mr Catt said: 'I had just stopped off at Pye Motors For a brew and come back to the truck and set off again.

'I only got a a little way down the road and I saw smoke coming out of the dashboard.

'By the time I had gone a short way the cab started filling with smoke so I just grabbed my dog and my phone and jumped out.'

Mr Catt, who runs his own haulage firm, Wayne Catt Transport, had been delivering to Gilbert's Foods in Morecambe, Lancashire, and was returning to Burnley when the flames broke out

The truck driver, who owns several haulage vehicles, had only recently spent £5,000 on new alloy wheels for the truck.The vehicle cost him around £30,000, but new ones can cost up to £120,000

The lorry was left a smoking skeleton after the fire had been extinguished, and has been completely destroyed. It is not yet known how the blaze started 

Mr Catt was unhurt in the incident, as was Tinkerbell. He added: 'I'm just glad it happened after I had set off again as I had left the dog in the cab on her own while I went For my brew'
