One moment of inexcusable thuggery is all it took to change one Australian man’s life forever.

Jack Hansen-Bartel, from Adelaide, suffered horrific injuries to his face from a brutal bashing on the night of his celebration after graduating from high school in Bangkok.

The trip to Koh Samui in the Gulf of Thailand back in June was supposed to be ‘the best time’ of his life but instead, he was left in and out of consciousness on the floor of a nightclub.

The 20-year-old received injuries so severe that it will take around one and a half years for all required surgeries to be completed.

‘I had no ability to defend myself as I was hit with cowards' punches,’ he told Fairfax Media.

The case has sent alarm bells and has revealed a dark underbelly in southern Thai resorts that attracts thousands of Australian tourists each month. 

The former Adelaide man has been in and out of hospital but his doctors have told him that he is looking at an 80 per cent recovery. 

Witnesses said after his attack, he was lying on the ground with some of his teeth missing, a flap jaggedly torn from his gum and swallowing his own blood, which made it difficult to breathe.

Hansen-Bartel’s 24-year-old brother Jesse and five friends dragged him outside and he described the moment his world was closing in and thought he was dying as blood gushed from his eye and mouth.

He received no help from staff at Samui's famous Green Mango club and was told by security to ‘keep it moving’ and ‘leave the club’ because Hansen-Bartel was ‘creating a scene’, according to Samui Times.

Hansen-Bartel was taken to the front gutter of a go-go bar called Dream Girls before he collapsed when he could no longer walk.

Described as an unprovoked attack, Samui police have charged two graduating students from an international school in China over the incident.

But six weeks later, the students created charges of their own against Hansen-Bartel, alleging they were protecting a female friend and claiming he was ‘molesting’ her, according to Fairfax Media.

Hansen-Bartel denied the claim but said he had met the female on the beach earlier that day and again at the bar in Soi Green Mango.

CCTV footage from the Green Mango Club showed Hansen-Bartel walking into the club with the woman before he was stopped by the students.

‘One said to me, 'she is with my friend…don't mess with her', Hansen-Bartel told Fairfax Media. ‘I said, 'Sorry, I didn't know.'

Hansen-Bartel said he then asked the woman if she knew the men and she said she did and wanted to stay with them. But he was later found severely injured that night.

Hansen-Bartel was working as a part-time model to put money aside to pay for university in Australia when he planned to return home but those plans will have to wait

His mother, Annie Hansen-Bartel told Fairfax Media that in the weeks following the complaint against her son, the family received harassing phone calls and threats from Samui.

‘We were terrified….we were trying to find a safe house to take Jack,’ Ms Hansen said.

‘It's unbelievable. We feel like we are fighting a mafia and money while Jack did nothing wrong.

The family have also attempted to transfer the case from Samui to a Bangkok court but was rejected.

'We fear we will not be able to get justice on the island,' she said.

Ms Hansen-Bartel said the case has been upsetting for her family as they struggle to deal with Thai government departments and police agencies. 

Hansen-Bartel was working as a part-time model to put money aside  for university in Australia when he planned to return home but those plans will have to wait.

He said his life has changed since and now suffers agoraphobia, severe depression and struggles to sleep at night because of the pain from his injuries.

‘I was to continue to work as a model in order to save to help pay for university and to have this sideline as my main source of income,’ he told Fairfax Media.

‘This will no longer happen and I have no source of income.’

A judge is scheduled to hear evidence in the case in January.
