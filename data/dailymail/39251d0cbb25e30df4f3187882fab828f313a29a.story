Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing increasing questions over his leadership. He was pictured last night at the Attitude Magazine Awards

Ed Miliband last night warned Labour MPs that their chances of winning the next election will ‘slip away’ unless they stop sniping at his leadership.

In a desperate plea for unity, Mr Miliband appealed to MPs to rally behind his faltering leadership – or risk being punished by the voters in May.

Mr Miliband has been rocked by criticism of his leadership style and priorities in the wake of Labour’s lacklustre party conference and near-defeat to Ukip in last week’s Heywood and Middleton by-election.

Last night's crunch meeting comes amid growing concern over Labour’s poor poll ratings – with the party barely ahead of the Tories in national surveys. Mr Miliband is also struggling to convince voters that he is a future Prime Minister.

Addressing a private meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party at Westminster last night, he insisted victory was ‘do-able’, but warned it would be thrown away if Labour descended into infighting.

‘Normally after an election defeat we show disunity and division,’ he said. ‘Instead, we have had four years of unity. I am not going to let us, seven months before an election, start lapsing into the bad habits of the past. Things are going to be more difficult. There will be ups and downs which make the last few weeks look easy. I know that we will pass that test.’

Mr Miliband was given a polite hearing by most MPs, although several attacked him over the party’s slump in the polls and failure to address the Ukip challenge.

Yesterday veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell said Mr Miliband needed to 'get out more' and meet ordinary voters - and accused him of being 'hapless' in big speeches. 

Referring to the Labour leader's conference gaffe, when he 'forgot' to mention the deficit in his set piece speech, Mr Mitchell said: ‘Ed is a marvellous bloke.

'When he’s out with the people he’s okay, but he needs to get out with the people more.

‘He is a bit hapless in these set-piece speeches where he forgets things. If you’ve forgotten something don’t tell the world you’ve forgotten something – shut up.’

It comes after a survey released yesterday revealed that voters now judge Mr Miliband to be almost as bad a leader as far-left pin-up Michael Foot, who led the party to its worst modern defeat in 1983.

A total of 22 per cent of voters think Miliband better than Foot, while 21 per cent favour Foot. Mr Miliband is seen as a worse leader that Gordon Brown, Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair.

Voters think Labour would be better off if Mr Miliband was replaced – with 54 per cent say Labour would fare better if he goes while just 6 per cent say the party would benefit from him staying.

Labour MPs have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of Mr Miliband as the general election approaches.

Graham Stringer, MP for Blackley and Broughton, admitted Mr Miliband was 'not an asset' on the doorsteps, and urged him to sack some of his close advisers.

Former Home Secretary David Blunkett meanwhile suggested that Labour should underplay the fact that Mr Miliband is their leader during the election. 

Despite pressure, the party has insisted it will not respond to the threat posed by Ukip by supporting Government targets to cut migration.

But officials promised Labour would say more on the issues of integration of immigrants, reducing their exploitation and ensuring they make a larger contribution before they receive benefits.
