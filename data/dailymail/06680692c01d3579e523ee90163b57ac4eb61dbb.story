A Pakistani-born man 
wanted to avenge the deaths of U.S. drone attacks in Afghanistan by 
blowing up a New York City landmark but lacked the money and materials 
to carry out the plan, a federal prosecutor said Tuesday.

Assistant
U.S. Attorney Karen Gilbert said at a bail hearing that Raees Alam 
Qazi, 20, researched bomb-making techniques on Internet sites affiliated
with al-Qaida, including one using Christmas tree lights, and the FBI 
recorded phone calls and conversations linking Qazi to a purported 'lone
wolf' plot.

'He fully intended to do this, 
and thankfully he didn't have enough money,' Gilbert said. Referring to 
casualties in U.S. drone attacks, she added: 'He wants to avenge those 
deaths and kill people.'

Accused: Brothers Sheheryar Alam Qazi, 30, and Raees Alam Qazi, 20, are charged with plotting to obtain a weapon of mass destruction in order to blow up a New York City landmark as revenge for U.S. drone attacks

Home base: Terrorist suspect Sheheryar Qazi was listed as a resident of the Sailboat Pointe condominium complex in Oakland Park, Florida

Qazi traveled to New 
York last month in hopes of getting a job to fund his terrorist plans, 
Gilbert said, but wound up sleeping in public transportation, a mosque 
and in restaurants, and riding a bicycle around the city looking for 
potential targets.

He then decided to return home on a Greyhound bus and
was arrested after arriving back in South Florida, she said.

Qazi,
a naturalized U.S. citizen who attended local Florida public schools, 
confirmed many elements of the plot in a statement to FBI agents after 
his arrest in late November, Gilbert said.

Investigators also found 
bomb-making and related components at the Qazi family home in Oakland 
Park, as well as explosives research evidence on a computer used by 
Qazi.

Qazi is charged along with his brother, 
30-year-old taxi driver Sheheryar Alam Qazi, with conspiring to provide 
material support to terrorists and with attempting to use a weapon of 
mass destruction in the U.S.

Both have pleaded not guilty to the 
charges, which carry a potential life sentence if the men are convicted 
of both counts.

Threat disrupted: Wifredo Ferrer, U.S Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, said any potential threat has been disrupted

U.S. Magistrate Judge William 
Matthewman ordered Raees Qazi held without bail until trial, finding 
that he is a danger to the community and a flight risk.

His older 
brother has already agreed to pretrial detention, but may seek bail 
later.

A trial is likely many months away.

Gilbert
said Raees Qazi was the intended operative, using either a suicide 
attack or a remote-control device to kill people in a crowded place such
as New York's Times Square, a Broadway theater or perhaps on Wall 
Street.

The elder Qazi supported his brother financially and 
logistically with the knowledge that Raees was planning a terror attack,
the prosecutor said.

In one conversation 
recorded by the FBI, Sheheryar Qazi compared his brother to a 'lone 
wolf, like the Times Square bomber.' Gilbert said Sheheryar Qazi was 
referring to Faisal Shahzad, who unsuccessfully attempted to detonate a 
bomb at the New York landmark in May 2010.

In another recorded 
conversation, Sheheryar Qazi says that his brother 'wasn't going to be 
in this world long.'

Raees Qazi's attorney, 
Daniel Ecarius, tried to persuade the judge to allow his release on 
bail, noting that Qazi had made money by selling bicycles on the 
Internet, had no criminal past and had already relinquished his 
passport.

Ecarius suggested Qazi could be released on house arrest with 
electronic monitoring, but Gilbert urged the judge to keep him locked 
up.

'He wanted to carry out an attack. If he is released from custody, he will,' she said.

The Qazi brothers had initial court 
appearances Friday, but court-appointed attorneys for the two did not 
immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

One official who spoke to ABC News 
described the younger brother's intent as ‘serious,’ but the source said
it did not appear that an attack was imminent.

‘This
was not a sting,’ sources told the news channel, adding that Raees Alam
Qazi had been in contact with overseas radicals, possibly connected to 
al Qaeda.

Still, the FBI found evidence that Raees Alam Qazi had been monitoring recent FBI ‘sting’ cases, sources told ABC.

South
Florida has seen several high-profile terrorism cases, including the 
conviction of al-Qaida operative Jose Padilla and the convictions of 
five men accused of plotting to join forces with al-Qaida to destroy a 
landmark Chicago skyscraper and bomb FBI offices in several cities.

More
recently, a Miami Muslim cleric and one of his sons are facing trial on
charges they provided thousands of dollars in financial support to the 
Pakistani Taliban terrorism group.
