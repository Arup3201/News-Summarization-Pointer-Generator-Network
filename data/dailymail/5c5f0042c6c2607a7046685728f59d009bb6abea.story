Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 30th league goal of the season but couldn’t prevent Real Madrid dropping two points in a 1-1 draw with Villarreal.

He is now only one goal from his tally for last season with 12 games left and has become the first striker to score 30 goals a season for the fifth consecutive campaign in one of Europe’s top leagues but he left the pitch annoyed at Real’s failure to pull away from Barcelona at the top of La Liga. 

They are now just two points clear of their rivals with a trip to the Camp Nou later this month still to come.

Goal: Gerard

Joel Campbell was in the starting line-up for Villarreal after coach Marcelino made wholesale changes just three days ahead of his team’s second leg cup semi-final against Barcelona.

The Arsenal loanee was bundled over by Pepe in one of Villarreal’s first attacks and from the free-kick the visitors won a corner which led to their first clear cut chance. 

It fell to Gerard Moreno but with only Iker Casillas to beat he shot straight at Spain keeper. When the rebound ran to Moi Gomez his effort was dived-headed to safety by Dani Carvajal. 

The keeper congratulated the full-back – both had saved certain goals.

Bale was seeing plenty of the ball down the Madrid right although he was at times handicapped by his preference for crossing with his left. 

He should have been awarded a penalty when Jaume Costa grabbed his arm at a corner and stopped him taking off to connect with Kroos’ kick. 

It was a spot-kick but the referee waved away the Welshman’s appeal.

From another Kroos corner on the half hour Bale this time jumped unimpeded and headed just wide. Varane came even closer shaving the post from another corner kick as Real pushed for the opening goal.

As the half went on Real took more and more risks with Marcelo flying forward and throwing himself at an Isco pass but failing to connect effectively. 

Bale then hit the top of Sergio Asenjo’s bar with a cross-shot from the right and Ronaldo blasted a free-kick over from 35-yards.

Villarreal had defended well and for the first time in the league since August Real Madrid went down the tunnel at half-time with the score at 0-0. The Bernabeu crowd had not helped with the usual nervous whistles for Bale when one of his passes went astray. 

He had shown more than most for the home side and in the second half his pass to Ronaldo brought about the opening goal. As the ball was played in Eric Bailey tried to take the Portuguese for a dance grabbing him around the waist and and spinning him around. 

The referee pointed to the spot and Ronaldo stepped up to score goal number 30 in the league this season.

He could have got his second moments later from another Bale assist but this time Asenjo blocked the effort and took an accidental Ronaldo knee to his face in the process.

Ronaldo then returned the favour to Bale but the he pulled his shot high and wide. Real Madrid now looked in complete control having broken Villarreal’s dogged resistance but they were in for a shock. 

With a sweeping eight-pass move from one end of the pitch to the other Villarreal went from keeper Asenjo to striker Moreno who leveled the scores. He played a one-two on the edge of the Real Madrid area with substitute Luciano Vietto and shot past Iker Casillas to silence the Bernabeu.

Real Madrid were almost back in front from their next attack but when Ronaldo ran on to Isco’s pass and shot goalwards Asenjo blocked the effort. Bale then crossed from the right and Ronaldo rose highest in the area but against Asenjo made the save brilliantly tipping the ball over his bar.

Carlo Ancelotti risked the wrath of the Bernabeu by taking off fans favourite Isco to put on Asier Illaramendi and he even threw on Javier Hernandez for Karim Benzema but Chicharito failed to make a difference going down dramatically in the area but not convincing the referee to point to the spot.

Vietto fell over when clean through with only Casillas to beat and he then saw the Spain keeper brilliantly turn away his diving header. For Real Jese shot wide with the goal gaping after Asenjo dropped the ball but a point was the very least Villarreal deserved.
