A pot-bellied pig destined for the barbeque has escaped the chop after being adopted by a hairdresser.

Susan Gordon, 53, took Yum Yum on after saving him from being slaughtered as a piglet.

The 10-month-old Vietnamese breed is now a regular at her hair salon, where he accompanies his new owner every day.

Ms Gordon, who runs Halo Hair Design in North Shields, North Tyneside, received a call from a local man who had planned to put Yum Yum on the coals, but had changed his mind.

And being an animal lover who boasts a menagerie of pets, she couldn't resist adding Yum Yum to her family.

She said: 'I saved him from going on a barbecue. A bunch of lads from the local pub had bought him to eat but decided they  didn't want him anymore and they were going to sell him to the gypsies.

'But they knew I was an animal lover and so I got a phone call saying, 'Will you take him?'

'When I knew they were going to put him on a barbecue I was horrified. They are my favourite animals so I had no doubt about taking him.'

Yum Yum now accompanies the stylist to work, and creates a stir among her pampered customers.

She adds: 'He comes with me to the hairdressers in the morning and at night. Everyone loves him, they think he is great.

Pampered: Yum Yum accompanies his besotted owner to work every day, and is walked like a dog twice a day

'My staff were a bit shocked at first but they are used to him now. He gets stroked a lot in the shop by customers.

'He runs around biting everything, he pulled down the Christmas tree this morning!'

Susan, who also has three bull terriers, a parrot and three budgies, walks Yum Yum twice a day often taking him to open and close the salon.

She said: 'When people see him their jaws drop. They slow their cars down and pull over to take pictures of him. Kids shout to  him in the street.

Animal lover: As well as daily strolls, Yum Yum is treated to a vegan diet, with most of his food donated by locals

'It can take an hour to get home sometimes as people are always stopping to take photos.'

And Yum Yum, who lives in a shed in Ms Gordon's back garden, sticks to a diet worthy of his celebrity status - he's vegan.

Ms Gordon explains: 'He can't eat any animal products at all because of foot and mouth so I feed him Vietnamese pig nuts.

'People donate a lot of food for him. My friends bring me boxes of apples and carrots for him to eat. He is lovely, he likes you to rub his belly and he is very intelligent.

'He is very easy to look after.He is very popular!'
