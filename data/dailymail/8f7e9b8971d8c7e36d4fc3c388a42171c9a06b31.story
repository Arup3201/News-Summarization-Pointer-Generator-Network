A flamboyant aristocrat who left a £1million island to the National Trust of Scotland has had his gift rejected.

Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees, whose bed-hopping, colourful life was said to be the model for James Bond, wanted to leave ownership of Little Bernera off the coast of the Isle of Lewis to the nation, but a rare decision the NTS rejected the offer.

The conservation charity said they rejected the island because Little Bernera is not 'significant' enough to warrant the cost it would take to keep.

Only a few weeks ago, the NTS described the bequest as "an extraordinary act of generosity from a man who led an extraordinary life.'

However, a spokesman for the Trust, confirmed that in recent years it has not taken charge of heritage properties without an endowment to help meet their maintenance costs.

'With regret, the Trust is declining the generous bequest of the island of Little Bernera made by the late Count Robin Mirrlees,’ he said.

'We have taken this decision having made a full assessment of the island in terms of its heritage significance.

'Whilst it is of undoubted value, it would not bridge any gaps within our existing portfolio of nationally important properties and would incur significant cost obligations.

'The property did not come with an endowment and we would have had to draw resources away from other, more significant sites to meet those obligations.

'This is not to say that we do not welcome bequests of property but we had no prior warning of the count's intentions and if we had, we might have been able to propose different alternatives in his lifetime.

'If anyone is considering leaving a historic property or landscape to the Trust, we would always urge them to make contact with us at the earliest stage.

'It is our understanding that, in accordance with Count Mirrlees' will, Little Bernera will now be subsumed within the rest of his estate and be passed on to a family member as per his wishes.'

However a group of crofters has been preparing to launch a community buy-out of the uninhabited island - and neighbouring Great Bernera where the count was laird of the 230-strong community.

Crofters hope to use right-to-buy legislation to take ownership of the 250-acre island and the larger Greater Bernera, which has been left to the count's grandson Cyran.

However, Stornoway-based solicitor Ken MacDonald, whose office has been dealing with the count's estate, said there are no current plans for sale.

The count's son Patrick de la Lanne - the 50-year-old mayor of Delmenhorst in Lower Saxony - from a long relationship with Duchess Margarethe of Wurttemberg, a granddaughter of Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, was disinherited by his father.

Count Robin, who once acted as the Queen's Herald - and was a descendant of King Louis-Phillipe I of France - died at the age of 87 in June. He left instructions for Little Bernera to be gifted to the NTS.

The close friend of 007 author Ian Fleming once jokingly promised in a radio interview to leave the island to Prince Harry. In 1996 the Queen, Prince Philip and Princess Anne explored the island and dined by the sea during a cruise of the Western Isles aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia.

The island, which has been referred to as 'one of the last specks of land before North America', boasts fertile soil, golden sandy beaches and a ruined church which, according to folklore, has its own resident spectre.

In 2000 the Count touted the isle to TV producers as the ideal place to film a reality show featuring castaway city-dwellers.

But it was in August that solicitor 
Ken MacDonald, who has been dealing with the estate of the count, 
revealed that Little Bernera would be given to the Edinburgh-based NTS.

NTS officials, who already maintain the islands of Canna and St Kilda in the Hebrides, were astonished by the development.

Bill
Gardner, the Trust's development manager for legacies, said then: 'This
is an extraordinary act of generosity from a man who led an 
extraordinary life.

'Once we
receive official confirmation we will assess the island's ecology and 
landscape as to how it can be best conserved for the nation in the light
of any conditions attached to the bequest.'

However
NTS has also come under recent criticism for its stewardship on Canna 
where since 2010, 20 residents - five sevenths of the population - have 
left or declared their intention to leave.

Little Bernera has been uninhabited for more than 150 years.

Influence: Count Robin was deeply involved in helping Ian Fleming (left) research James Bond’s adventures for the novel On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. The film starred George Lazenby (right) as 007, who posed as genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, a cover inspired by the count's job as heraldic researcher at the College Of Arms in London

The
Count, an Oxford graduate and World War 2 veteran, took part in the 
Queen's coronation in full regalia in his role of Rouge Dragon 
Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary and was later invested as a Knight of 
Honour

A legendary womaniser, his sole marriage, aged 45 - to a nurse half his age - lasted less than one week.

He assisted Fleming with research for On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Bond's cover role in the story - a heraldic researcher at the College of Arms in London - was based on the aristocrat, who served in that post between 1952 and 1967.

The Count also came up with the phrase 'The world is not enough', which became the spy's motto, and many years after Fleming's death, the title of a Bond movie.

In 1993, the one-time multimillionaire briefly put Little Bernera up for sale after discovering his fortune was fast evaporating.

A newspaper advert claimed it would be possible to build residential accommodation for intrepid holidaymakers and concluded: 'What an excellent opportunity is now afforded to purchase a part of dear old Scotland'.

He was persuaded to hold on to the island and dedicated his final years to meditating and reading tracts on Buddhism and 'mystic philosophy'.

The count also had a worldwide property portfolio - including residences in France, Sicily and Inchdrewer Castle in Banff.

Count Robin, formerly known as Robin Ian Evelyn Stuart Grinnell-Milne, Comte de la Lanne-Mirrlees, titular Prince of Coronata-Gualtieri, bequeathed his assets in a will registered in the Books of the Lord Council and Session after his June 23 death.
