Revellers reached for the clouds when they formed sky-scraping human towers at a festival in India.

Spanish 'castellers' from the Catalonia region of Spain brought their tradition to the Dahi Handi festival in Mumbai.

Dramatic footage shows people joining arms to form a human pyramid at the festivity which celebrates the birth of Krishna, the eighth incarnation of the god Vishnu in Hinduism.

In the video the 'castellers' are more than six-man high to the delight of the gaping spectators who cheer them on.

The Spaniards then show the crowd, known as 'govindas', how to build a tower and they team up and replicate the move.

In the past the human towers have reached as high as 30ft, but last week the Bombay High Court limited their height to 20ft in a bid to prevent people from getting hurt.

A reveller said: 'It has been a fantastic experience. Who knows? We might make better towers in the future.'
