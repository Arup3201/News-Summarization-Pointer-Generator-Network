Shocking footage has emerged of a speeding boat  flipping into somersaults through the air  but narrowly misses another craft full of holidaymakers.

The boat was captured, believed to be on a mobile phone, taking off along  the water at the popular holiday destination of Wongulla on the Murray River in South Australia on Saturday.

But as it picks up its pace, the driver loses control of his high-powered vessel, while tilting one side to another before dangerously flipping and spinning close to a boat full of people.

This is the terrifying moment a speeding boat flips through the air and narrowly misses a boat full of people

Spectators can be heard screaming and yelling out in fear as the boat flips in the air towards them in a terrifying close encounter.

Despite his dangerous move, the boat is seen back on surface just metres away down the river. 

It is unclear what followed after the video ended but it seems no one was injured.

The incident comes just days after South Australian Police issued warnings and urged boaties to take extra care and vigilance over the holiday.

Extra police are expected to patrol the area along South Australia's coastal areas and the Murray River.
