Rudy Giuliani is doubling down on his controversial comments about 'black-on-black crime,' saying he saved thousands of African American lives by cutting the murder rate during his tenure at New York's mayor.

'The danger to a black child in america is not a white police officer. That's going to happen less than 1percent of the time,' he told Fox and Friends this morning.

'The danger to a black child, if it was my child, is another black - 93percent of the time it's going to be another black.'

Giuliani is under fire for comments he made on 'Meet the Press' on Sunday during a heated argument about race and crime in America. 

During a discussion about the protests over a white police officer shooting dead an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri, he told Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson: 'White police officers wouldn’t be there if you weren’t killing each other.'

Not backing down: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said he saved the lives of more African Americans than any mayor in city history by dramatically reducing the murder rate

Dr Dyson, a frequent MSNBC contributor, called Giuliani a 'white supremacist.' Others quickly chimed in online to say that the 70-year-old's comments were racist. 

Giuliani is refusing to soften his stance. In an interview today on Fox News he said that by reducing the violent crime rate - and the number of African Americans being murdered in New York City - he did far more for the black community than black pundits and activists. 

He further implied that Dr Dyson was a racist for focusing on the shooting in Ferguson and not 'black-on-black crime.'

'It's a matter of whether you want to be some kind of racial demagogue, who I consider a racist, which many of these people are ... or whether you want to be fair and decent and really save people's lives,' he said. 

He unabashedly defended his record as New York City mayor. Crime plummeted dramatically during his tenure from 1994 to 2001. 

'I probably saved more black lives in this city than any mayor in the history of New York City, with the possible exception of Mike Bloomberg, who was there for 12 years,' he said.   

Sound off: Rudy Giuliani appeared on Meet the Press and turned a segment about racially proportionate police forces in the wake of Ferguson to say white cops wouldn't be needed 'if you weren't killing each other'

'We've tried to make the police force of New York City as proportionate as we possibly can. We go out of our way to do that. I think we do a pretty good job, not a perfect job.' 

He quickly diverted from that subject, arguing with MSNBC contributor and Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson about black crime.

'I find it very disappointing that you're not discussing the fact that 93 percent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks,' said Giuliani. 

Giuliani did not mention the source used, though a study from the Bureau of Justice Statistics found in reported crimes from 2005, 93 percent of black murder victims were killed by someone black.

The study also found in the same year that 85 percent of white murder victims died at the hands of a white person.

Dyson pushed back against Giuliani, calling the link made by the mayor a 'false equivalency.'

'First of all, most black people who commit crimes against other black people go to jail,' Dyson said. 

Back and forth: On a segment about racially proportionate police, Giuliani first stated he worked to keep a balanced force, then later argued in favor of more white cops in black neighborhoods

'Number two, they are not sworn by the police department as agents of the state to uphold the law,' he added.

Giuliani took off his glasses and cut in to argue  for more police in black neighborhoods as Dyson questioned officers' ability to effectively police those communities.

'The police presence cannot make a distinction between those who are criminals and those who call the police to stop the criminals,' he stated.

The segment eventually turned into both talking over each other while Anthony Gray, attorney for Michael Brown's family, sat silent, before Giuliani capped his rant.

'Why don’t you cut it down so so many white police officers don’t have to be in black areas?' Giuliani shouted. 'The white police officers wouldn’t be there if you weren’t killing each other.'
