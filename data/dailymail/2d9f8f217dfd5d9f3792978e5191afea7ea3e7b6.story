When fashion design student Anaïs Bordier was watching a YouTube video she was stunned to see a face that looked uncannily like her own staring out of her computer screen.

Miss Bordier then discovered that not only did she share a birthday with Samantha Futerman, the actress in the clip, but the pair had both been born in Seoul, South Korea - prompting the young women's claim that they are twins who were separated at birth and adopted by different families on opposite sides of the globe.

Now the pair’s astonishing story is to be made to a documentary film and a book, focussing on their chance meeting via the internet, and the moment they came face to face for the first time.

Last February Miss Bordier, 26, who is studying at Central st Martins in London but was raised as an only child in a Parisien suburb, had been watching a YouTube film when she noticed that an actress in the clip looked very similar to her.

She also shared similar mannerisms to the actress, who turned out to be Miss Futerman, also 26, who grew up in Verona, New Jersey and was living in Los Angeles.

Miss Bordier contacted aspiring actress Miss Futerman on Twitter and the women say they soon worked out that they were both born in the South Korean capital on November 19, 1987.

'I was terrified and excited at the same time,' Miss Bordier told The Sunday Times.

'Sam responded with a picture of her birth records. There was nothing there to say she was a twin but then she sent pictures through and it seemed to settle it. It felt like having a heart attack, but it was also the happiest moment - a new world was opening.'

Miss Bordier had been placed into foster care by an American agency - Holt International Children's services - and adopted by her French parents three months later.

Meanwhile Miss Futerman was adopted around three months after her birth, having been fostered by another agency - Spence-Chapin.

She said that documentation given to her adoptive parents did not contain the names of her birth parents, or if she had any brothers or sisters.

Following their Twitter conversation the women plucked up the courage to speak to one another via a Skype video call.

Miss Futerman then started a Kickstarter page to fund a documentary to chronicle their first meeting and their subsequent adventures together.

The pair hoped to raise $30,000, around £19,000, and more than 1,000 people have donated a total of $44,000 (£27,000) - which paid for a DNA test to reveal once and for all if the pair are in fact sisters.

The women have now started a second Kickstarter campaign to raise $80,000 (£49,000) for their documentary's post-production, and have taken in more than $20,000 (£12,000).

They say that have taken a DNA test, but have vowed only to reveal the result in their film - prompting some to wonder if the pair's story is an elaborate hoax.

Miss Futerman journeyed to London to meet Miss Bordier in May last year.

Miss Bordier said: 'The door opened and I felt paralysed. She was right in front of me and I didn't want to move. We were just staring at each other.'

Similarity: The suspected twins say they have used their physical similarities to play tricks on their parents - just like in the 1998 Lindsay Lohan film The Parent Trap

She said that her father had cried upon meeting Miss Futerman, while her mother believed that the pair were so alike that they had to be sisters.

They both share a love of Harry Potter, the arts, and many of the same television programmes, while Miss Bordier confessed that the duo had taken advantage of their physical similarities to play a trick on Miss Futerman's mother and father.

'I came out first and surprised them and they stopped for five seconds, saying, "What? What? No!" and they said we were identical too. It was just like The Parent Trap.'

The 1961 Hollywood movie, remade in 1998 starring Linday Lohan, features twins who were separated as babies and brought up by their divorced mother and father respectively only to meet as teenagers at summer camp.
