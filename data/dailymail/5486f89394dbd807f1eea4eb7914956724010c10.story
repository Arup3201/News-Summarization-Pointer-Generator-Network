These stunning sculptures of heavy beasts have been fashioned from scrap metal.

They are the work of artist John Lopez who welds the pieces from abandoned farm machinery.

Based in the town of Lemmon, South Dakota, the 43-year-old has created full-size representations of creatures including a horse, buffalo and even a cowboy atop a triceratops.

Mr Lopez had a successful career in bronze sculpting, but changed his working techniques after the death of his aunt Effie in a car accident.

He moved to his widowed uncle Geno Hunt's ranch and set about making a family cemetery. But after completing a perimeter fence Mr Lopez ran out of material and, being 35 miles from the nearest town, had to search for usable scrap iron on site.

It led on to working with the disused metal as an art material.

He said: 'I am a sculptor and love to create. I started welding sculptures together using scrap iron after my Aunt Effie's death. I built a cemetery around her head stone on the ranch and it all started from there.'
