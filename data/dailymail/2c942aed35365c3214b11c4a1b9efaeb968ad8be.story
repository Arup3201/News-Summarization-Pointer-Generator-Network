For Chelsea, their magnificent start to the season goes on. 

Having won nine of their eleven games in the Premier League so far, Jose Mourinho's team are unbeaten and top of the table after Saturday's 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield. 

The Chelsea manager, however, believes a defeat will arrive at some time. Asked if Chelsea could go through the season unbeaten, he said: 'No chance. It's possible to be champions. We want to play for that.

'But in modern football I don't believe in going unbeaten all season. It's a good start and we can keep this stability.

'We can lose tomorrow but my team is still the same. One day we will lose but the next game we will win again.

'We will play badly but we will recover our game because we are a strong team. We are a stable team.

'I have been in the game so long I know the defeat will arrive and the bad moment will arrive. We will be ready for that.

'We believe in everything. We are a happy camp. We believe in the players.'

Mourinho paid tribute to midfielders Cesc Fabregas and Ramires as both players played with injuries. The Chelsea manager also believes that winning goal scorer Diego Costa will benefit from not playing for Spain over the coming international break.

He added: 'I know every player was fantastic and some were brilliant but I give you Ramires and Fabregas in particular.

'They both had injuries but risked everything to play and help. Maybe I will lose them for a match or two but this game wasn't in two or three weeks, it was today. This was the game.

'They put themselves there for the team like other players will do in the future because the spirit is fantastic.

'Ramires has been in trouble for a while but he knew we needed him. Fabregas put himself on the line. He gambled. We all gambled. He can't play for Spain. He can go but he will come back.

'Spain have made a good decision with Diego. He is in good condition now. When they have him again they will have a good Diego and not a bad Diego.'

Chelsea conceded a controversial goal at Anfield almost ten years ago in the Champions League, Luis Garcia's first-half effort being adjudged to be over line at the same end where Gary Cahill scored.

Mourinho, for one, is certainly happy that technology is now available to help officials.

'I'm happy for everything to help,' he said. 'What has happened today is that everybody knows the truth. It's a goal.

'It's fantastic for the players and the crowd and the referee. It can be hard for him. Without the technology it can be difficult to make a decision.

'It's more difficult to use for other things like penalties. Sometimes it's impossible for the referee to give.

'Goal-line technology is simple. It costs money but it's simple. You don't have to stop the game, it's a decision in seconds. You can't put a price on the truth.'

After the game, John Terry posted a picture on Instagram of Chelsea's players celebrating on the team and is hopeful their form continues.

'We have seen that everyone has beaten everyone,' he said. 'We have had a good run, hopefully we can come back from the international break and continue our form. We are proving hard to beat and long may that continue.'

Terry conceded that Liverpool should have been awarded a penalty late on, saying: 'We have had some not go our way, it evens itself out'.
